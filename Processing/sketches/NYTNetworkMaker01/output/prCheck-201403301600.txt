 -page:27- data transmitted by Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft indicate Jupiter is source of bursts of high-energy radiation whose occurrence near earth has long puzzled space scientists; radiation bursts have repeatedly been detected by earth satellites orbiting above region where earth's magnetic field fends off such radiation; bursts, some of which continue for 2 or 3 days, contain cyclic features that are synchronized with 10-hr spin rate of Jupiter; examination of data indicates radiation bursts reach earth when magnetic force lines that stretch from sun through solar system link Jupiter with observing instruments; bursts have been observed near earth once every 13 mos when earth in its flight around sun overtakes Jupiter; fact that electrons, even when traveling almost at speed of light, are constrained to spiral along magnetic force lines lies at root of phenomena being explored by Pioneer 11; discovery of Jupiter as source of radiation bursts may have solved astronomical question bearing on control and timing of planet's intense, low-frequency radio transmissions by Io, Jupiter's innermost moon; scientists speculate Io may contain iron or some other electrically conducting material that makes it a planet-sized 'direct current generator'; magnetic field seems to be sweeping through Io at 34 miles per second, phenomenon which would generate direct current, as in conventional power plant, as well as catastrophic lightning discharges near planet causing highly directional radio emissions; theories pertaining to Jovian magnetic field discussed; photograph of Jupiter taken by Pioneer 11 (L)

 -page:68- scientists rept on Dec 6 that preliminary examination of data radioed from Pioneer 10 spacecraft indicates that 4 of Jupiter's satellites very likely have atmospheres, that Jupiter and its entire family of 12 moons are heavier than predicted and that planet's opaque atmosphere is an efficient 'greenhouse'; say: Io, 2d satellite out from Jupiter, has tenuous atmosphere 20-million times less dense than Earth's and is 20 times heavier than predicted--fact which suggests that satellite contains metallic elements and must be more like Earth and Mars in density than like Jupiter; infrared temperature map of Jupiter indicates that planet, as predicted, radiates 2.5 times more heat than it absorbs from sun and that there apparently is little variation in cloud temperatures on day and night side of planet--fact which indicates that Jupiter does not readily dissipate heat it gets from sun; Jupiter's magnetic field extends 4.5-million miles into space, but its more well-defined effect in trapping radiation particles extends out only 1.2-million miles; discovery of Io's atmosphere is inferred from analysis of radio signals that passed fringes of satellite and were seen to be bent; scientists maintain such occurrence is 'firm evidence' of layer of electrons surrounding Io; theorize that satellite's atmosphere probably extends 65 mi from its surface; Jet Propulsion laboratory scientist Dr J D Anderson says that study of effects of Jupiter's gravity on trajectory of Pioneer 10 indicates that 'the mass of the whole Jupiter system is heavier' than had been estimated; new estimate is that Jupiter and its moon is heavier by as much as mass of 1 to 2 of Earth's moons; Anderson says Io was found to be 20% more massive than Earth's moon and appears to be more like inner than outer planets, but agrees that Io could have formed elsewhere in solar system and may have been captured by Jupiter's powerful gravity; determines that 99% of Jupiter's mass appears to lie beneath point some 1,400 mi below planet's hypothetical surface--boundary where gaseous hydrogen of planet's atmosphere apparently turns to liquid hydrogen; between 'surface' and 1,400-mi boundary, mass of Jupiter is equal to less that 3 Earth masses; Calif Inst of Tech scientist Dr G Munch repts spacecraft's infrared instruments, which penetrated 13 miles into Jupiter's upper atmosphere, recorded temperatures ranging between -215 and -230 degrees Fahrenheit; says Jupiter radiates more heat along a wide equatorial band than it does at other latitudes; variations in heat radiation appear to correspond to to planet's parallel multicolored bands of clouds; Munch concludes that Jupiter's thick opaque atmosphere has a 'very large heat capacity,' adding that it probably takes 1 wk to before it dissipates heat of sun; calls planet's cloud cover 'a very effective greenhouse'; Langley Research center physicist Dr W H Kinard says Pioneer 10 had recd 300 times as many micrometeoroid impacts in Jovian magnetic field as it did in interplenetary space; theorizes that particles could have been sucked in by Jupiter's gravity or could be orbiting planet as kind of 'dust ring'; spacecraft's magnetometer reptd data suggesting that Jupiter's magnetic axis might well be offset from planet's axis of rotation

 -page:24- space engineers on June 3 are studying 2 alternative methods of supplying additional electricity to Skylab space station should astronauts fail in 2d attempt to free jammed solar-power panel; Skylab mission dir Schneider says it might be possible for 2d Skylab crew to deploy an array of solar cells on a flexible panel or for 3d and final crew to attach improvised solar power unit to nose of Apollo spacecraft, which would then be inserted into side of Skylab's docking tunnel; says ideas are 'very conceptual' but that space station's electrical shortage is so critical that 'we're trying not to close the door on any way of achieving the Skylab objectives'; space station lost thermal and micrometeroid shield during launching from Cape Kennedy and solar-power panel failed to deploy

 -page:1- Studies conducted by NASA over last four years concluded that damage to brittle, heat-dissipating material on leading edge of space shuttle Columbia's wings posed one of highest risks of catastrophic accident; focused largely on tremendous damage that could be caused by unlikely event that tiny meteoroid or orbital debris hit leading edge of wing, which is made of lightweight, reinforced carbon-carbon; impact has emerged as one of leading theories about cause of breakup of shuttle on reentry into earth's atmosphere on February 2 killing all seven astronauts on board; analysis by Boeing Co, shuttle contractor, concluded that underside of leading edge was probably hit, along with large swath of panels; engineers report comparatively little testing to determine if slower-moving debris posed similar hazard, hence saw little risk from debris dislodged from external fuel tank that struck left wing during launching from Cape Canaveral; diagram; photo (M)

 -page:1- NASA officials express doubt that piece of foam insulation from external fuel tank that struck space shuttle Columbia during January 16 launching from Cape Canaveral could have led to destruction of ship during reentry into earth's atmosphere on February 1 killing all seven astronauts on board; shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore says material is too light to cause fatal damage and that investigators are seeking 'missing link' to explain disaster; dismisses speculation that piece of foam could have been saturated with water or encrusted with ice heavy enough to magnify damage it did to heat-dissipating tiles on underside of left wing; defends engineering study, conducted during 16-day mission, which concluded that damage from foam debris would not affect flight safety; says crew was involved in discussions about spacecraft being hit by debris and did not raise concerns about damage to craft; photos (M)
