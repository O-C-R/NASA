I elaborated that I would be visiting out of sympathy, and was thinking of bringing a covered casserole. She did not encourage this. The museum was dappled with families and foreigners. I told the young woman who sold me my ticket that I feel bad about Pluto, adding ''It's so much more than an ice ball.''

In the domed hall itself, in the days before prepackaged programming became the rule, a man would stand pointing out the stars and constellations with an arrow-shaped beam of light. And the great Zeiss projection machinery would seem, silhouetted against the heavens, to be a creature out of ''War of the Worlds.'' As the show began, twilight would gradually fall, a mock skyline of houses ringing the dome beneath the blackening sky. There was no question about where one was or who one was in that artificial cosmos. One was a child of Earth, whose surface was pocked by meteorites, whose peoples devised myths to make sense of the heavens, whose contemporary citizens could sit in a city park and learn about the constellations their ancestors had carved into the sky and whose scientists were busy revealing that sky's true shape. The Zeiss machine, a descendant of one invented in 1923 for the first modern planetarium, in Germany, was literally a projector, casting on the ceiling images in which humanity could see a reflection of itself.",

The orbiter's high-resolution camera was able to spot not only where the Opportunity rover is exploring, but even its tracks in the sand. Elsewhere, the sharper-than-ever images have revealed large boulders in areas that previously looked smooth, which led NASA to reconsider the landing site for its Phoenix mission, scheduled to set down in 2008. A Polar Canyon, Dipped in Color The false-color image, right, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's high-resolution camera, shows part of the side wall of Chasma Boreale, a canyon in Mars' north polar region. The reddish area is dust-colored ice at the top of the canyon. The stripes are layers of different materials that have piled on top of each other, and the dark material at the bottom of the canyon may have been sand dunes. Perservering on the Ground NASA's rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, were designed to last just three months on Mars, but both of them passed their third anniversaries this month. The two rovers are aging. The right front wheel on Spirit no longer turns, for example, and one of Opportunity's turning motors has failed. But Spirit continues to drive on its other five wheels, and Opportunity just makes wider turns. While Spirit hunkered down through most of winter -- the season is now turning to spring -- Opportunity drove five miles to reach Victoria Crater. Below left is Opportunity's view of Cape St. Mary, one of the promontories that jut into the half-mile-wide crater as other parts of the crater edge erode. What the scientists see so far at Victoria Crater fits with their notion that this region of Mars was once wet. Like other craters in Meridiani Planum, the plains that Opportunity landed on, the rocks appear to have formed from sediments that were pushed by flowing water, dried out and then blown around by wind. What the scientists have not seen yet: finer sediments that settle out on a lake bottom. ''What we would love to find is evidence for a standing body of water,'' said John Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the rover science team. Martian Winds And Their Toll On the Planet Above: The bottom of an impact crater is eroding into a series of ridges. Middle left: The Medusae Fossae formation, a light-colored terrain in the Martian midlatitudes, contains wind-sculpted landforms, including elongated hills known as yardangs. Near left: Polygonal patterns of cracks and troughs are seen in many Martian landscapes. The polygons are about 10 yards to 20 yards in diameter and are similar to patterns seen in cracking permafrost on Earth. KENNETH CHANG",

But the ban was weakened somewhat in 1997, and poaching of elephants has increased in recent years. One problem in enforcing the ban is that tusks tell no tales. It's hard to tell where specific ones came from, so law enforcement and conservation agencies are handicapped in trying to zero in on the poachers who obtained them.",

The images confirm one major prediction of the leading theory of the explosive birth of the universe, but they failed to reveal another crucial feature that scientists had hoped would buttress that theory. It is uncertain how sharp a revision, if any, will be needed to account for the new evidence.",

Take the oriental army worm caterpillar, Mythimna separata, which infests corn plants. During the day, the bugs hide underground or tucked behind a leaf where it joins the stalk. At night, they emerge and munch away on the plant. So the army worm is nocturnal, and it's a good thing, too: that helps it avoid being infested by a parasitic wasp, Cotesia kariyai, that is attracted to corn plants during the day. There's only one problem. Researchers in Japan have discovered what makes the army worm nocturnal, and it's not light -- at least not directly.",

If all larvae of one species were scattered over a wide area -- creating, in effect, a giant mixing bowl -- genetic sameness would be the expected result.

Urban areas can be as much as 20 degrees hotter than nearby rural ones, a result, among other factors, of all that concrete and asphalt pumping out heat as sunlight hits it. Sweltering temperatures affect humans, of course, but are there other biological consequences of what are known as urban heat islands? A study by Michael J. Angilletta Jr. of Indiana State University and colleagues shows that there is. Urban ants, they report in PLoS Biology, can stand the heat better than those from out of town.",

Recycling is not an economical option. Scientists have long sought ways to make polystyrene more environmentally friendly. Researchers at the National University of Ireland and Hamburg University in Germany have come up with a new approach. If polystyrene itself is not biodegradable, they ask, can it be converted into something that is?",

That's the conclusion of Hideaki Miyamoto of the University of Tokyo and colleagues, who see evidence of vibrations at work in images of the asteroid's gravel-strewn surface. The close-up images were taken in 2005 by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa as it hovered over and touched down briefly on the 1,000-foot asteroid in a sample-return mission. The images show the kinds of gravel migration, alignment and sorting that can be caused by shaking, and are often seen on Earth along riverbeds or after landslides.",

It consisted of two rocket ships attempting to blast each other out of the sky with torpedoes while trying to avoid falling into a star at the center of the screen. Although cartoonish in appearance, the game was amazingly faithful to the laws of physics, complete with a gravitational field that affected both the torpedoes and the rockets. Only one feature seemed outlandish: a ship that drifted off the edge of the screen would reappear on the opposite side.",

They said the finding was significant, but they did not know what it meant. Experts say they believe that the left wing was opened up to superheated gases, probably at the leading edge, as the shuttle tried to return to earth on Feb. 1. Their operative theory is that the cause of the breach was a strike by debris on liftoff. But nine weeks into the investigation, they say they are still uncertain about the chain of events, and new findings like the one today about the reinforced carbon-carbon wing panels merely added to the mystery.",

It finds it hard to breathe, as a full mouth impedes the flow of oxygen-bearing water past the gills. Now, you may wonder just how often cardinalfish, found around coral reefs, actually become stuffed to the gills. The answer is quite often, though food has nothing to do with it. Like a few other types of fish, cardinalfish are mouthbrooders. Males keep fertilized eggs in their mouths for a week or two, until they hatch.

Homer, an out-of-work director of a local community center in Maine, first heard that NASA was turning to America's backyard inventors to brainstorm new technologies for a possible return to the moon, he had an idea. With NASA sponsoring seven design contests for everything from a new lunar lander to a new space glove, anybody with a home-brewed invention could enter. Homer's previous jobs included some gigs in the aerospace industry as well as work sewing boat sails. So, Homer told me not long ago, he ruled out building a flying spacecraft but decided that ''the glove contest represented something of the scale I could achieve working out of my home by myself.'' He'd always been a garage tinkerer, he said, and being unemployed, he also wanted to prove to his 14-year-old son ''that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.'' Oh, he added offhandedly, ''the money is a motivator, too.'' At stake was a prize -- presented with one of those giant cardboard checks -- for $200,000.",

This week, the agency announced plans to establish a permanent base on the Moon by 2024, explained why we should want to send astronauts back to a world they visited repeatedly more than three decades ago, and described what they might do when they get there. It was belated justification for a decision that the Bush administration and Congress have already made. But the payoff is distant and the likely future costs very high, leaving it unclear how realistic these aspirations will prove to be. The agency has done a commendably thorough job by consulting some 1,000 experts and 13 other space agencies in fashioning its plans. Such a costly and difficult venture should ideally be pursued cooperatively with other nations, to share the costs and the risks. It would be especially desirable to have multiple ways of reaching the Moon in case the American program runs into problems like those that grounded the shuttles.",

But even the most dedicated of those see just a few highlights of the Smithsonian's collection, because the building on the National Mall has had space to display only about 10 percent of the museum's holdings. Soon visitors will be able to see much more. On Dec. 15, two days before aviation history buffs mark the 100th anniversary of the first powered flight, the museum will open the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, a new 760,000-square-foot hangar on the edge of Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va. It will eventually house most of the rest of the collection, displaying many of the museum's treasures for easy public viewing for the first time. The Wright Brothers' 1903 Flyer will stay in the downtown building, but those who make the 28-mile trip out to Dulles will be able to see all of that aircraft's giant progeny, including Air France's first Concorde, the prototype for the Boeing 707, NASA's prototype Space Shuttle and the Superfortress that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan in 1945",

The question now is, Can it continue raising rates without choking off economic growth? Investors and others were wrestling with that question this week amid signs that prices are rising too fast even as economic growth appears to be slowing. 'UNWELCOME,' NOT UNEXPECTED -- Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent last month, and 0.3 percent after stripping out volatile food and energy costs. That pushed the annual rate to 2.4 percent this year. While economists had anticipated just that kind of increase, it still is in a range that the Federal Reserve chairman recently described as ''unwelcome.'' Investors and others assume that means the Fed will continue raising interest rates, reducing the amount of cash and credit available. Fed board members have also been on the stump, talking tough about keeping prices in check. If effective, such efforts could ease pressure for even higher rates just as the economy appears to be flagging.",

Take the oriental army worm caterpillar, Mythimna separata, which infests corn plants. During the day, the bugs hide underground or tucked behind a leaf where it joins the stalk. At night, they emerge and munch away on the plant. So the army worm is nocturnal, and it's a good thing, too: that helps it avoid being infested by a parasitic wasp, Cotesia kariyai, that is attracted to corn plants during the day. There's only one problem. Researchers in Japan have discovered what makes the army worm nocturnal, and it's not light -- at least not directly.",

The researchers, from Oregon State University, have been studying the decline in aspen groves in the park, using historical documents, aerial photographs and ring-dating. As they report in the journal Biological Conservation, they determined that for more than a century and a half, until the late 1920's, young trees were able to survive and mature within existing groves. Things changed around the time that the wolves in and around the park were eliminated (the last wolves were seen in 1926).",

A distinguished panel of astronomers judged that Hubble ''has arguably had a greater impact on astronomy than any instrument since the original astronomical telescope of Galileo.'' Yet now, just as Hubble was scheduled for a major rejuvenation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has consigned it to slow death. The agency has canceled a planned servicing mission that would have upgraded Hubble's instruments and extended its life past the end of the decade, making it likely that the telescope will run out of battery power and functioning gyroscopes by about 2007.

The administrator's reluctance makes it imperative that Congress insist on a full-scale analysis of the risks and benefits of servicing the Hubble, and that the academy refuse to undertake anything less.

But before the construction started in 1999, Federal Aviation Agency engineers and air traffic controlers who would be working in the tower wanted to make sure nothing would block their view. To find out, they went to the Airway Facilities Tower Integration Laboratory at the F.A.A.'s William Hughes Technical Center at Atlantic City International Airport. There, using mockups of a cab, or tower interior, plus panoramic photographs or coumpter-generated images on six-foot-high wrap-around display panels, computer scientists and electrical engineers can simulate the view from any airport control tower, including air traffic and weather conditions. The virtual Newark tower is a 240-degree photographic image that includes Elizabeth, Newark, New York City and Newark Bay and the turnpike bridge. Bill Vaughan, the supervisory electronics engineer who manages the laboratory, talked about his operation.",

One by one, we filed into a silver-domed observatory and climbed a ladder to look into the lens of a 20-inch telescope named Rachel, one of the largest refractors in the western United States open to the public. Tonight's target was M-15, a group of about 250,000 stars almost 40,000 light-years away. To put it into mind-boggling perspective, one light-minute is equal to a little more than 11 million miles, and despite this almost unfathomable distance, M-15 is still within the Milky Way. This age-old human fascination with our place in an infinite universe is the foundation upon which the new $76 million, 86,000-square-foot Chabot Space and Science Center was built. It is one of the premier astronomy and space museums in the country, with exhibits, equipment and science programs that have earned it an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.

Twenty-seven astronauts and mission specialists will carry out the work of Challenger, 75 years after its namesake exploded upon liftoff. The isolation team uses robotic arms to test hazardous materials. The life support team quashes an oxygen depletion emergency. And the navigation team successfully triangulates the comet using a computerized grid on a star field. When the mission is done, these fifth graders slap high-fives, clear the air lock and bolt outside for lunch.",

If such a shuttle were to get in trouble, one of the three places on the East Coast where it can make an emergency landing is the New Jersey Air National Guard's 177th Fighter Wing Base at Atlantic City International Airport. There, firefighters attached to the 177th Wing will get the astronauts out in a hurry. Tech. Sgt. Joseph Bannon, one of those firefighters, talked about the rescue plans. Q. Why did NASA choose the base at Atlantic City National International Airport?",

Their ability to return directly to the hive after a rambling flight in pursuit of food is remarkable, although exactly how they accomplish this has been unclear.

This was the very problem that NASA had spent two years and hundreds of millions of dollars trying to correct. The agency took the only reasonable step by announcing that it would ground the shuttle fleet indefinitely while it tried to identify and fix the foam-shedding problem. It should use that time to re-examine whether the shuttle program and the international space station that it serves are worth the risk and enormous cost to keep them at the core of the space program. The shuttle is looking increasingly like a jalopy that has gotten too expensive to keep repairing and may be ready for a trade-in.",

By all accounts, the board will harshly criticize the performance and competence of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and rightly so. The space agency's two catastrophic shuttle accidents -- the loss of the Challenger in 1986 and of the Columbia last February -- resulted from management failures, pure and simple. As Congress and the White House assess the future of the nation's space program, they must start with the need to refashion NASA, whose reputation for engineering excellence and dedication to safety is in tatters. Once that work is done, Washington will have to address the long-term issue of whether the space program should continue to focus on operations in low Earth orbit or reach for bolder, more adventurous missions deeper into our solar system. Members of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, headed by Harold Gehman, a retired admiral, have identified the likely cause of the accident. They blame foam insulation that broke loose from the external fuel tank for punching a hole in the thermal protection system on Columbia's left wing, allowing hot gases to enter. The immediate question raised by this accident is whether the shuttle fleet is safe enough to fly again. Admiral Gehman says the investigation has found no showstopping flaws. He expects the shuttles to resume flying in six to nine months, after NASA fixes some defects and makes it possible to inspect and repair the shuttle in orbit.",

The transaction would propel Cendant into the leading ranks of the travel reservation industry and give it a formidable tool that would help it steer business to its other travel franchises like Howard Johnson, Ramada, Days Inn, Super 8 and Avis. Cendant, which owns WizCom, a unit that helps travel companies connect to travel-reservation services, is also negotiating to buy Worldspan, a reservations system operated by Delta, Northwest and T.W.A. But a deal for Worldspan was not seen as imminent, the executives said.",

Has the inherent danger of space exploration simply become too much for our country to bear? Are we at the point where we believe the risks to human lives and the expenditure of national treasure are too great to push back the frontiers that bind us to this planet? It will be up to President Bush and members of Congress to provide history with America's answer. Since the recording of time there has been a terrible price extracted for exploring our world. Currently we are celebrating the centennial anniversary of aviation, and since that first flight there has not been a single milestone that did not create martyrs of those seeking to go faster and higher in ever more complex machines.",

It was also a welcome sign that NASA is willing to go the extra orbital mile to support superb science, even while it squanders large sums on completing the space station to perform research that can't begin to compare with the Hubble's in importance. For a decade and a half, the Hubble has made discoveries that have helped revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Its typical role is to pick up a hint from ground-based telescopes and then use its unparalleled vantage point above the atmosphere to probe deeply into some puzzling phenomenon. The Hubble has peered farther into space and farther back in time than any other instrument. It has discovered more than 500 proto-galaxies that emitted light when the universe was in its formative stages, confirmed the jaw-dropping discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and helped establish the rate of expansion and the age of the universe.",

Under a proposal floated initially by the Office of Management and Budget, the three centers would be removed from the Smithsonian's jurisdiction and transferred to the National Science Foundation, a federal agency that awards grants for scientific research. That possibility has Smithsonian scientists in a tizzy, as well it might. Although Bush administration officials were justifying the move on management grounds, it is not clear that they have thoroughly explored the likely consequences to the research programs or to the Smithsonian itself. The three facilities at issue are the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in Cambridge, Mass., which has done world-renowned research on planets in other solar systems and the large-scale structure of the universe; the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, in Panama, which was judged ''undeniably the best'' in the world by a panel of outside experts; and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, on the eastern shore of Maryland, which has conducted valuable studies on nutrient flows in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and on microbial pollution from the ballast water of commercial ships.",

A rock in space -- like a fragment knocked off one asteroid in a collision with another in the belt between Mars and Jupiter -- does not normally roll like a rack of ribs on a rotisserie spit. So one side gets more sunlight than the other and gives off more heat in return. This difference, the Russian engineer I. O. Yarkovsky suggested a century ago, can be enough to cause the rock to drift slightly in its orbit.",

The bus-size satellite was launched in late 2006 and promptly went dead. Now it is drifting downward toward the atmosphere. Officials say it contains a loaded fuel tank, which would probably survive re-entry, hit the surface and vent previously frozen hydrazine gas over an area of about two football fields.

On Oct. 15, 1997, few people paid attention to the launching of the rocket carrying the Cassini spacecraft. It was just another launching, after all. But after more than six years of quiet voyaging through the solar system, with virtually no attention from the rest of us, Cassini has made its way to a place where we will all begin to marvel once more. Last night, Eastern time, the spacecraft crossed the plane of Saturn's rings and inserted itself into orbit around that planet -- the first craft to do so. By early this morning, if all went well, Cassini should have begun taking pictures. Those pictures are just the scenic portion of a potential trove of new data about most things Saturnian. Like the other data, they will remind us of what an extraordinary object Saturn, that strange gaseous planet, really is. If you've ever looked through a telescope and seen Saturn's rings, you immediately understand the impact they had nearly 400 years ago on Galileo, who was the first to view them. Sometimes we see them edge-on, and sometimes they cut a broad swath across Saturn's orb. The effect of that change in aspect through a telescope is to give Saturn a three-dimensional presence -- a reality, in fact -- that the other planets in the solar system seem to lack. Saturn and its rings have become staples of our imagination, and with luck they are about to be reimagined before our eyes.",

Hood, whose malevolent gaze unleashes telekinetic powers, plans to hijack the Tracys' 21st-century technology to rob the world's 10 largest banks, starting with the Bank of England.",

Right now, the tiny but hungry playhouse is reaching out from mission control in North London to colonize a bit of East London, a bit of Central London, eventually a bit of New York, and, if NASA ever opens up the planetary system to space thespians, one day no doubt bits of the Moon or Mars or both. If we discount the much-hyped London debut of Kathleen Turner in a stage version of ''The Graduate'' -- of which more in a moment -- the Almeida has been gobbling up the London critics' attention in recent weeks. First there was the premiere of Harold Pinter's ''Celebration'' at the company's grungy headquarters in Islington. Then it presented Nicholas Wright's new ''Cressida'' in the West End, with a magnificently dilapidated Sir Michael Gambon as a trainer of the boy actors who took female roles in early-17th-century England. And now it has reopened the doors of the East End film studios once used by Alfred Hitchcock and staged ''Richard II'' with Ralph Fiennes as the king, a production expected at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, along with ''Coriolanus,'' in early September.

And because gravitational force changes with mass, as Earth's water goes, so goes its gravity. Measurements of tiny changes in the Earth's gravitational field have given the clearest picture yet of where the water is going. The data, from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, a pair of satellites, show the seasonal changes in water distribution around the globe, particularly in the Amazon basin, the largest watershed on the planet.",

It is hard to imagine a grander, more thrilling story than the one Simon Singh tells in ''Big Bang.'' His fast-paced history of the Big Bang theory encompasses all of recorded human history, from the first attempts to measure Earth and the stars to the discovery of quasars and dark matter. It moves, smoothly and rapidly, from the Greeks to Copernicus and then to Einstein and the rest of the 20th-century theorists whom Mr. Singh calls the ''mavericks of the cosmos.'' It is an interplanetary voyage that transports the reader, in space and time, from the cramped confines of the Ptolemaic system to the current expanding universe, created in an explosion some 10 billion to 20 billion years ago, with distances measured in billions of light years. ''The Big Bang'' is, quite literally, cosmic.",

''Yes,'' he was saying, ''right,'' he said, ''a space station, right, of course, they'll have a space station, they'll have a space station by 2001.'' His tone was admirably calm for someone who was raving. I thought of this matter-of-fact prophet only recently, because now that it's 2001, we do have an International Space Station, and few people seem to care. In April, the station's crew coped with a critical computer breakdown -- the sort of danger that Stanley Kubrick and his co-author, Arthur C. Clarke, had predicted in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' -- and did so without distracting America from the start of the baseball season. In July, the mission team installed an elaborate new air lock, and again the public yawned, although not even ''2001'' had foreseen that such orbital tinkering might be performed by a Col. Susan J.

But if you ventured out at night to look for ice caps and canals, chances are you saw only a slightly brighter and more pinkish smudge than usual. That's because 99 percent of Americans (and Europeans) live in places tainted by light pollution, according to NASA. Two-thirds of American homes no longer have a view of silky strands of the Milky Way -- we've ''lost'' 2,000 stars. Light pollution comes in three basic types: skyglow light trespass and glare. Skyglow is the one that drowns out the stars. It is caused by poorly designed, unshielded and improperly aimed fixtures, like street lamps and billboards with bottom-mounted lights that ''uplight'' the advertisement. As the light floods upward, it reflects off airborne dust and moisture particles, obscuring the heavens. Thanks to skyglow, the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson outside Los Angeles -- where the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding -- has been rendered virtually useless for deep-sky observations.",

''Seat belts!'' barked the pilot, Albert Kolk, to his teenage grandson and two young friends. Then he reached for a red lever in the cockpit. An orange-and-white parachute as big as a house opened above the plane and gently landed it in a rocky clearing. If the maker of the parachute succeeds, one day commercial aircraft like regional commuter jets may have similar safety systems. First, though, there is the challenge of creating a parachute robust enough to rescue bigger planes.",

If all larvae of one species were scattered over a wide area -- creating, in effect, a giant mixing bowl -- genetic sameness would be the expected result.

''I feel bad about Pluto being demoted to a dwarf planet,'' I told a woman from the museum's Visitors Center. She reminded me that the debate has been going on for years. I elaborated that I would be visiting out of sympathy, and was thinking of bringing a covered casserole. She did not encourage this. The museum was dappled with families and foreigners. I told the young woman who sold me my ticket that I feel bad about Pluto, adding ''It's so much more than an ice ball.'' She smiled indulgently and said, ''But I'm not sure you want to live there.''",

It is an engineering science whose frontiers are pushed ahead by people building new tools rendered in silicon and programming code rather than the breathtaking epiphanies and grand unifying theories of mathematics or physics. Yet computer science does have its revelatory moments, typically when several advances come together to create a new computing experience. One of those memorable episodes took place in December 1995 at a supercomputing conference in San Diego. For three days, a prototype project, called I-Way, linked more than a dozen big computer centers in the United States to work as if a single machine on computationally daunting simulations, like the collision of neutron stars and the movement of cloud patterns around the globe.",

Through no great fault of his own, Mr. O'Keefe is leaving the space program in worse shape than he found it. The remaining shuttles are still grounded for safety repairs, the space station they service is a shrunken shell and the agency has been given a challenging long-term mandate for space exploration with little new money to carry it out. Mr. O'Keefe announced recently that he would soon depart for a high-paying job as chancellor of Louisiana State University. He will bequeath to his successor a daunting array of half-finished tasks as the American space program struggles to get back on course. The irony is that Mr. O'Keefe's impact has been virtually the opposite of what was initially expected. A self-described ''bean counter'' who had been deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, he was appointed to NASA in December 2001 to bring its finances under control after the International Space Station program was staggered by a projected overrun of almost $5 billion. The chief worry voiced by space enthusiasts was that he would bring an accountant's mentality to an agency that needed bold vision. As it turned out, he is leaving the agency's finances still mired in confusion but played a role, yet to be spelled out, in shaping the exploration vision put forth by the White House.",

It was a brave call, since repairing the Hubble will put the shuttle at greater risk than a typical mission to the International Space Station. It was also a welcome sign that NASA is willing to go the extra orbital mile to support superb science, even while it squanders large sums on completing the space station to perform research that can't begin to compare with the Hubble's in importance. For a decade and a half, the Hubble has made discoveries that have helped revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Its typical role is to pick up a hint from ground-based telescopes and then use its unparalleled vantage point above the atmosphere to probe deeply into some puzzling phenomenon. The Hubble has peered farther into space and farther back in time than any other instrument. It has discovered more than 500 proto-galaxies that emitted light when the universe was in its formative stages, confirmed the jaw-dropping discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and helped establish the rate of expansion and the age of the universe.",

On the contrary: it is a quiet, intimately scaled three-person drama directed in a patient, easygoing style, without any of the displays of allusive cleverness or formal gimmickry that so often masquerade as important filmmaking these days. At first glance the story, about a grizzled boxing trainer whose hard heart is melted by a spunky young fighter, seems about as fresh as a well-worn gym shoe. This is a Warner Brothers release, and if it were not in color (and if the young fighter in question were not female), ''Million Dollar Baby,'' with its open-hearted mixture of sentiment and grit, might almost be mistaken for a picture from the studio's 1934 lineup that was somehow mislaid for 70 years.",

The first scenes follow the adventures of a group of reckless young pilots who crash their expensive military plane, bicker and fight among themselves and lose the chance to be the first Americans in space to a chimpanzee named Mary Ann and a new civilian agency called NASA. There is something odd about the four smooth-faced, jaunty young men who make up Team Daedalus, as the pilots are known. Their faces have the clean, generic good looks we've come to associate with the bygone days of the Eisenhower administration, but their voices have the rasp of hard experience, as well as an uncanny familiarity, since they belong to Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James Garner and, most recognizably, Clint Eastwood, who also directed the picture.",

Now both gadgets have evolved to be pretty much the same; your cellphone contains your datebook, and you can make calls from your organizer. Convergence can happen in nature, too. Consider the case of lamnid sharks, like the mako and the great white, and tuna. They have evolved separately for about 400 million years, and in some ways are about as different as fish can be. The tuna has bones, the other has only cartilage. But they have the same streamlined body shape, and both have a tall tail fin that is attached to the body at a narrow point .",

Certainly, his ''Coast of Utopia,'' which opens in late July at the National Theater, looks like the major dramatic event of the British summer. The trilogy is his first work for the theater since ''The Invention of Love'' in 1997. That play, a major success in both London and New York, emerged from months of research into classical scholarship, Victorian attitudes to homosexuality and the life of its main character, the gay scholar and poet A. E. Housman. This time, Stoppard's serendipitous mind has turned to idealists and revolutionaries in 19th-century Russia. We should expect an educated but, let's hope, entertaining trip through a nation and a family in political muddle and turmoil.",

The new observatory, while only half as big as the 24,000-pound Hubble, will have a primary, light-gathering mirror 20 feet in diameter compared with the existing telescope's 8-foot reflector. With a mirror that has a light gathering area six times as large as the Hubble's and a suite of more sensitive instruments, the new telescope should be able to detect objects a hundredth the brightness Hubble can see in visible light and one four-hundredth the brightness in the infrared part of the light spectrum.",

The huge $60 billion engineering project has been delayed repeatedly, and when the astronauts were finally sent aloft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the venture got limited attention in an America absorbed in its closest presidential race in years. Even so, if all goes well in coming years, this could mark the start for Americans of continuous operations in space as opposed to intermittent shuttle trips. This page has been lukewarm about the station from the beginning, feeling that it would be enormously costly and yield only limited scientific returns, most of which could be gained by satellites and unmanned probes to the solar system. Many of the claims advanced for the station -- such as the opportunity it provides to grow perfect crystals in the absence of gravity and to perform other exquisite manufacturing tasks -- have been hyped beyond reason and debunked by expert committees. But that does not mean there is no value at all in the enterprise. The fact that 16 nations are collaborating on the American-led project is a diplomatic achievement, as is the participation of Russian space and rocket scientists who might otherwise be tempted to put their skills to malevolent use. Once the station is fully assembled and running, scientists may learn more about how astronauts react, physically and mentally, to extended periods in space. The astronauts will master the skills for assembling big structures in space.",

What seems like a clear trend, however, in fact misrepresents the underlying reality. We have indeed seen many conflicts over the centuries, vividly in the case of Galileo versus the church.",

The new crew will have less time for research and will have to pay extra attention to food, water and other consumables, which are in increasingly short supply without regular shuttle visits.",

In re-enacting, with a heavy heart and a heavy hand, the actual events surrounding the storied 1836 battle in the war of independence fought by Texas against the Mexican forces of General Santa Anna, the movie is both elegiac and trivial. This is an accomplishment of sorts, generally of the sort that no one plans. The filmmakers' motivation is obviously to strip away the ennobling layers of lacquer applied to the lives of Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie and the others fighting to wrest Texas from Mexico and establish a republic -- a sheen polished by previous projects, including the poisonously intoxicating coats lavished by Disney's own ''Davy Crockett'' shows.",

Later, there's the scene in which the wife, all alone in that house and justifiably sullen because of neglect, greets the husband, who has been out cavorting with adoring women, spending all his time on his career, or both. The table is set for a meal, which the great man missed hours ago. TNT's cookie-cutter movie ''Evel Knievel,'' which has its premiere tonight at 8, delivers both scenes in stupefyingly standard fashion. Seeing her new home, Jaime Pressly, as Linda Bork Knievel, says, ''It's so big,'' and, ''This just cost way too much money.'' Later, when Evel (George Eads) makes his first appearance after a night of kissing strange women's breasts and drinking, he appears in the doorway, with his shirt open to the waist. Linda is clearing away the breakfast dishes.",

Science can tell us about what exists in space and time; it cannot tell us about the eternity that created the space and time that science studies. Religion is neither scientific nor antiscientific, but an entirely different kind of knowledge. It is too bad that many scientists limit their understanding of religion to the most simplistic literalism. No one will benefit from a fight that is fought on the terms that these two sides have chosen. Robert D. Bulkley Beaverton, Ore. To the Editor: In the most recent tug-of-war, atheistic scientists seem to be partnering with conservative Christians in a classic debate centered on Western dualism.

After all, what you're left with, after the coup de théâtre, is a singing tree, which cannot but strike some listeners as a wee bit static. ''Aida'' it's not. And yet Richard Strauss's late opera (which had its first performance in 1938) is enjoying a modest renaissance. There have been recent productions in Venice, Essen, Berlin and Vienna; and last season, New York City Opera gave it its first American staging. Now, it has won a powerful new champion in the soprano Renée Fleming, who has recorded the work with Semyon Bychkov and the WDR Symphony Orchestra. Tomorrow, she and Mr. Bychkov bring it to Carnegie Hall in the course of a three-city minitour that will continue to the Kennedy Center.",

Begun in England four years ago, this occasional series has become one of the world's most innovative pop festivals by applying a simple principle: hand over the programming to a well-connected artist or musician and allow every nepotistic indulgence. What results is more variety than you'd expect. After having the New York brahmins of Sonic Youth program a Los Angeles festival a year ago, the organizers have made a more local but still stranger curatorial choice: Matt Groening, the creator of ''The Simpsons,'' who was a rock critic early in his career and seems to have been paying a good deal of attention to alternative music. His highlights include Wire, the Boredoms, Coldcut, Johnny Dowd, the Melvins, Mission of Burma, Kool Keith, Fantomas, Melt-Banana, Yo La Tengo, Le Tigre and the Fall. Mr. Groening has also arranged the reunion of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band after more than 20 years, minus the captain, Don Van Vliet, who remains immovable in his new life as a painter. (Another A.T.P. festival, with Stephen Malkmus as the boss, was planned for the New York area in September but has been postponed.) www.atpfestival.com",

The crossing allows telescopes to take pictures of the rings from the unlighted side, free from the glare that can obscure faint parts of them. Of course, a year on Uranus is equivalent to 84 Earth years, so this semiannual event is happening for the first time since the planet's rings were discovered, in 1977.

Jett seems less formidable than the sneering, snarling bad-girl-of-rock reputation that preceded her to Broadway. Her speaking voice is a tired contralto, and beneath a rainbow of lid-to-brow stage makeup, her left eye is flecked with blood: she spent the morning at the hospital having a piece of theater grit extracted by her favorite physician, the one she entrusts with her vocal cords. But Ms. Jett's ''Rocky Horror Show'' understudy won't inherit her dual roles as Columbia and Usherette, or that solo wail on guitar in ''The Time Warp,'' tonight. No one has ever called Ms. Jett a quitter. When 23 record companies declined to produce her first album, dismissing a leather-wrapped, guitar-slinging teenage girl as offensively unmarketable, she did it herself.",

According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the gravity of a spinning object should tug slightly on the surrounding space and slowly drag it around in circles. Any matter would be pulled along, even though ordinary gravity can only attract matter, not push it sideways. Observational astronomers have remained skeptical of that supremely bizarre prediction, since they have never found clear, direct proof that the phenomenon exists. But with the discovery of a strange new signal by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, a NASA satellite designed to measure X-ray sources in deep space, a few more astronomers may be ready to get on board.",

By all accounts, the board will harshly criticize the performance and competence of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and rightly so. The space agency's two catastrophic shuttle accidents -- the loss of the Challenger in 1986 and of the Columbia last February -- resulted from management failures, pure and simple. As Congress and the White House assess the future of the nation's space program, they must start with the need to refashion NASA, whose reputation for engineering excellence and dedication to safety is in tatters. Once that work is done, Washington will have to address the long-term issue of whether the space program should continue to focus on operations in low Earth orbit or reach for bolder, more adventurous missions deeper into our solar system. Members of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, headed by Harold Gehman, a retired admiral, have identified the likely cause of the accident. They blame foam insulation that broke loose from the external fuel tank for punching a hole in the thermal protection system on Columbia's left wing, allowing hot gases to enter. The immediate question raised by this accident is whether the shuttle fleet is safe enough to fly again. Admiral Gehman says the investigation has found no showstopping flaws. He expects the shuttles to resume flying in six to nine months, after NASA fixes some defects and makes it possible to inspect and repair the shuttle in orbit.",

One can only marvel at the fantastic precision of the computerized technologies that allowed the robotic Spirit rover to land near the center of its target area in a vast crater the size of Connecticut. Space is a very demanding environment where, even if thousands of things go right, a single mishap can doom the whole mission. Scientists were holding their collective breath late Saturday when the Spirit turned its heat shield downward, deployed its parachute, jettisoned the shield, fired its retrorockets, inflated its air bags, bounced high off the surface and rolled to a stop, upright and in a seemingly perfect position to study what is described as a ''scientific sweet spot.'' Yesterday scientists said they were thrilled at how well the instruments were checking out after all that shaking. They proudly displayed the first three-dimensional photographs from the surface. What a welcome change after a number of discouraging failures over the past several decades! All told, more than half of all Mars probes launched by Earth's spacefaring nations have ended in disaster, either blowing up in Earth orbit, losing their way in space or crashing or conking out on the Martian surface. The Russians have had the most misfires, but even the United States lost two orbiters and a lander because of malfunctions and human error. In the latest forays, a Japanese spacecraft failed to reach Mars orbit, while a British landing craft appears to have been lost on the surface. It is no wonder that Mars has been dubbed the dark planet for space vehicles.",

The goal was for General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler, now a unit of DaimlerChrysler, to work together with auto suppliers, government laboratories and universities on a range of technologies aimed at making cars more fuel efficient.",

The problem for NASA was a bill -- the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act -- that bans spending federal money in Russia because of that nation's dealings with hostile countries. NASA relies heavily on Russia for transport to and from the International Space Station aboard Soyuz spacecraft, and after 2010, when NASA shuts down the space shuttle program, the Soyuz, above, will be the only vehicle taking people to the station.",
