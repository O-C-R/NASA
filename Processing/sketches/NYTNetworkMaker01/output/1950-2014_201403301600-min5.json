It finds it hard to breathe, as a full mouth impedes the flow of oxygen-bearing water past the gills. Now, you may wonder just how often cardinalfish, found around coral reefs, actually become stuffed to the gills. The answer is quite often, though food has nothing to do with it. Like a few other types of fish, cardinalfish are mouthbrooders. Males keep fertilized eggs in their mouths for a week or two, until they hatch. Broods can be large, up to a quarter of the fish's body weight.",

The answer, of course, is that every mission is different, every program is different, every person is different. For me, there is no question that space travel gave rise to an anxiety, a heightened sense of alertness. But I think most of my colleagues would agree that this has less to do with concern for your safety than with anxiety that your performance will not measure up to expectations. The big worry is that you are on the verge of messing up, and that might lead to a problem, endangering the mission and the crew. There is hardly anything productive about worry or fear when you can't do anything about the circumstances. Why be anxious until something happens? I think about taking off in a fighter plane -- you get the aircraft in the air and raise the gear, and if at that moment the engine goes out, you're in big trouble. Yet it wouldn't be much fun to be a fighter pilot if you were filled with fear every time you went out on the runway. I don't think anybody -- astronauts or otherwise -- is born with some kind of right stuff. It's something you work into. You don't learn it, but you adjust to it in your own way. Or else you wash out of flight school and get a job as a journalist.",

Some of those half-century-old imaginings may have been outlandish, but the cards left their mark, assisted by decades of science fiction that confidently assumed we were on the brink of an era of pioneering exploration. In a way, we were, though not quite as those cards suggested. But the appetite they whetted remained.",

But even the most dedicated of those see just a few highlights of the Smithsonian's collection, because the building on the National Mall has had space to display only about 10 percent of the museum's holdings. Soon visitors will be able to see much more. On Dec. 15, two days before aviation history buffs mark the 100th anniversary of the first powered flight, the museum will open the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, a new 760,000-square-foot hangar on the edge of Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Va. It will eventually house most of the rest of the collection, displaying many of the museum's treasures for easy public viewing for the first time. The Wright Brothers' 1903 Flyer will stay in the downtown building, but those who make the 28-mile trip out to Dulles will be able to see all of that aircraft's giant progeny, including Air France's first Concorde, the prototype for the Boeing 707, NASA's prototype Space Shuttle and the Superfortress that dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan in 1945",

NBC's aviation reporter, Robert Hager, was the first to report that the plane was missing on the morning of July 17. And his counterpart at CBS, Bob Orr, was the first to report the details of the radar track that indicated Mr. Kennedy had turned out to sea, possibly because Mr. Kennedy was disoriented, before he lost control of his plane. These aviation reporters are among the few remaining members of what was once a much larger corps of journalists specializing in coverage of air and space travel.",

Much of the shuttle is protected by a gantry that is moved away before launching, but the 15-story-tall external fuel tank, with its distinctive coating of orange insulating foam, pokes out well beyond the top of the structure.",

But S. gregaria's destruction is limited to the Middle East, Africa and western Asia; it is the only locust found in the Old World. The other 50-odd species in the genus are found in the Americas. Biologists have long wondered how this separation happened. Because the desert locust, in particular, is such a long-distance traveler, some scientists think the New World locusts must be descended from desert locusts that crossed the Atlantic ages ago. But others say S. gregaria is so closely related to a group of American locusts that it probably originated in the New World, a single lineage having crossed the ocean fairly recently.",

If all larvae of one species were scattered over a wide area -- creating, in effect, a giant mixing bowl -- genetic sameness would be the expected result. But there are enough differences between fish on different reefs to indicate that populations do stay separate, and many larvae do make it home again.",

Urban areas can be as much as 20 degrees hotter than nearby rural ones, a result, among other factors, of all that concrete and asphalt pumping out heat as sunlight hits it. Sweltering temperatures affect humans, of course, but are there other biological consequences of what are known as urban heat islands? A study by Michael J. Angilletta Jr. of Indiana State University and colleagues shows that there is. Urban ants, they report in PLoS Biology, can stand the heat better than those from out of town.",

Recycling is not an economical option. Scientists have long sought ways to make polystyrene more environmentally friendly. Researchers at the National University of Ireland and Hamburg University in Germany have come up with a new approach. If polystyrene itself is not biodegradable, they ask, can it be converted into something that is?",

Take the oriental army worm caterpillar, Mythimna separata, which infests corn plants. During the day, the bugs hide underground or tucked behind a leaf where it joins the stalk. At night, they emerge and munch away on the plant. So the army worm is nocturnal, and it's a good thing, too: that helps it avoid being infested by a parasitic wasp, Cotesia kariyai, that is attracted to corn plants during the day. There's only one problem. Researchers in Japan have discovered what makes the army worm nocturnal, and it's not light -- at least not directly.",

These and other top scientists have visited the museum and contributed to our courses, workshops and lectures because they felt our hands-on science programs for children were substantive and dynamic. Our director, Dr. John Loret, is a marine biologist who has participated in expeditions with Thor Heyerdahl. Dr. Loret, a former Explorer's Club president, has led more than 35 global science expeditions himself. You don't draw a stellar caliber of people like the ones mentioned to collaborate with or direct an organization when you're merely a ''pocket museum.'' Last year alone, more than 92,000 schoolchildren and adults participated in the museums programs and activities. Our courses run the gamut in variety. In our paleontology program, students actually unearth bones, map them out, then create protective jackets around them just as paleontologists do, or they may build an advanced rocket and launch it in our rocketry program. Others might collect and maintain live specimens from the sea and perform salinity experiments on a boat that goes out in the Long Island Sound. As for our widely popular travel expeditions for adults, CNN filmed our 1998 trip to Easter Island because of the El Nino implications in the Pacific Ocean that we investigated. The program, ''Forging Ahead: Easter Island Expedition,'' aired several times nationally and itnernationally last fall. The History Channel also aired the program this June.",

It is a number that scientists have sought ever since 1929, when Edwin P. Hubble discovered that the galaxies are flying outward at velocities that increase with distance. Estimates of the expansion rate, also known as the Hubble constant, are fundamental to all theories of cosmic evolution. But they have fluctuated wildly between numbers that would put the age of the universe anywhere from 10 billion to 20 billion years.",

Inlaid in the floor, in colored terrazzo, was a representation of an Aztec calendar stone. The massive Willamette Meteorite squatted by the museum entrance, a pitted sculpture created according to some unreadable design. In the lobby a mural depicted the cosmology of the Blackfeet Indians. In the domed hall itself, in the days before prepackaged programming became the rule, a man would stand pointing out the stars and constellations with an arrow-shaped beam of light. And the great Zeiss projection machinery would seem, silhouetted against the heavens, to be a creature out of ''War of the Worlds.'' As the show began, twilight would gradually fall, a mock skyline of houses ringing the dome beneath the blackening sky. There was no question about where one was or who one was in that artificial cosmos. One was a child of Earth, whose surface was pocked by meteorites, whose peoples devised myths to make sense of the heavens, whose contemporary citizens could sit in a city park and learn about the constellations their ancestors had carved into the sky and whose scientists were busy revealing that sky's true shape. The Zeiss machine, a descendant of one invented in 1923 for the first modern planetarium, in Germany, was literally a projector, casting on the ceiling images in which humanity could see a reflection of itself.",

          "lead_paragraph": "It is hard to recapture, so long after the event, what a galvanizing effect John Glenn's first ride into orbit had on an apprehensive nation. In the years before that triumph, Americans had been plunged into self-doubt by the Soviet Union's success in orbiting an unmanned Sputnik satellite and then two Russian cosmonauts while a succession of American rockets exploded or misfired. Then, on Feb. 20, 1962, the freckle-faced, square-jawed Marine flier got America back in the space race with the nation's first manned orbital flight. A delirious public honored him with a tumultuous ticker-tape parade and canonized him as a genuine American hero whose exploits owed much to his unswerving patriotism, his enduring marriage, his deep roots in Presbyterianism and small-town America. Now Mr. Glenn, retiring from the Senate at the age of 77, is poised to mount again into the heavens, this time as a lowly payload specialist on today's scheduled flight of the space shuttle Discovery. Instead of piloting the spaceship, he will serve as a guinea pig for medical tests to determine the effects of weightlessness on an aging body. But neither his duties nor his low crew ranking will have much to do with how anyone views a flight that long ago became known as The John Glenn Flight, a testament more to past eminence than present value.",

In the books I have written since I turned 70, I have displayed a contrary, even dour view. Mine was a dubious, uncelebratory account of that decade. Each time, I received protesting letters telling me how wrong I was. My correspondents told me that for them, old age is the best time of their lives, their golden years. They have never been happier, more fulfilled, more satisfied. They are of a mind with Browning's Rabbi Ben Ezra: ''Grow old along with me. The best is yet to be.''",

          "lead_paragraph": "Taken From Above The instruments aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, now in the third month of its scientific mission, have taken expansive global images, like a downward look at Mars' north polar region, above, and colorful close-ups, like one of Victoria Crater, right. The orbiter's high-resolution camera was able to spot not only where the Opportunity rover is exploring, but even its tracks in the sand. Elsewhere, the sharper-than-ever images have revealed large boulders in areas that previously looked smooth, which led NASA to reconsider the landing site for its Phoenix mission, scheduled to set down in 2008. A Polar Canyon, Dipped in Color The false-color image, right, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's high-resolution camera, shows part of the side wall of Chasma Boreale, a canyon in Mars' north polar region. The reddish area is dust-colored ice at the top of the canyon. The stripes are layers of different materials that have piled on top of each other, and the dark material at the bottom of the canyon may have been sand dunes. Perservering on the Ground NASA's rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, were designed to last just three months on Mars, but both of them passed their third anniversaries this month. The two rovers are aging. The right front wheel on Spirit no longer turns, for example, and one of Opportunity's turning motors has failed. But Spirit continues to drive on its other five wheels, and Opportunity just makes wider turns. While Spirit hunkered down through most of winter -- the season is now turning to spring -- Opportunity drove five miles to reach Victoria Crater. Below left is Opportunity's view of Cape St. Mary, one of the promontories that jut into the half-mile-wide crater as other parts of the crater edge erode. What the scientists see so far at Victoria Crater fits with their notion that this region of Mars was once wet. Like other craters in Meridiani Planum, the plains that Opportunity landed on, the rocks appear to have formed from sediments that were pushed by flowing water, dried out and then blown around by wind. What the scientists have not seen yet: finer sediments that settle out on a lake bottom. ''What we would love to find is evidence for a standing body of water,'' said John Grotzinger, a professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology and a member of the rover science team. Martian Winds And Their Toll On the Planet Above: The bottom of an impact crater is eroding into a series of ridges. Middle left: The Medusae Fossae formation, a light-colored terrain in the Martian midlatitudes, contains wind-sculpted landforms, including elongated hills known as yardangs. Near left: Polygonal patterns of cracks and troughs are seen in many Martian landscapes. The polygons are about 10 yards to 20 yards in diameter and are similar to patterns seen in cracking permafrost on Earth. KENNETH CHANG",

There were things said, as usual, about the mystery and power of black holes and quasars. The flamboyant Betelgeuse, a star some 40,000 times as luminous as the Sun, had its moments. And the astronomers were overjoyed to see the first pictures from the revived infrared camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, images of stellar nurseries and of galaxies in collision that promised new discoveries.",

The large amount of seasonal dust storm activity captured on the image included a storm system churning above the planet's northern polar cap (top), with a smaller dust cloud nearby. Another large dust storm spilled out of the giant Hellas impact basin in the southern hemisphere (lower right).",

There were some marbles, some crayons, a few insects, a lot of plant seeds, and even Central Park pond water -- all to answer one of childhood's most fundamental questions: What happens to stuff in space? In recent years NASA has developed an educational program designed to fire the imaginations of the young whenever flaming engines propel one of its spaceships skyward. That is why, besides dozens of technical experiments prepared by scientists and tucked away in the bays of Columbia, there were also projects from, among others, a preschool class in New Freedom, Pa., and a 4-H club in Sacramento.",

It was a brave call, since repairing the Hubble will put the shuttle at greater risk than a typical mission to the International Space Station. It was also a welcome sign that NASA is willing to go the extra orbital mile to support superb science, even while it squanders large sums on completing the space station to perform research that can't begin to compare with the Hubble's in importance. For a decade and a half, the Hubble has made discoveries that have helped revolutionize our understanding of the universe. Its typical role is to pick up a hint from ground-based telescopes and then use its unparalleled vantage point above the atmosphere to probe deeply into some puzzling phenomenon. The Hubble has peered farther into space and farther back in time than any other instrument. It has discovered more than 500 proto-galaxies that emitted light when the universe was in its formative stages, confirmed the jaw-dropping discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and helped establish the rate of expansion and the age of the universe.",

The question now is, Can it continue raising rates without choking off economic growth? Investors and others were wrestling with that question this week amid signs that prices are rising too fast even as economic growth appears to be slowing. 'UNWELCOME,' NOT UNEXPECTED -- Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent last month, and 0.3 percent after stripping out volatile food and energy costs. That pushed the annual rate to 2.4 percent this year. While economists had anticipated just that kind of increase, it still is in a range that the Federal Reserve chairman recently described as ''unwelcome.'' Investors and others assume that means the Fed will continue raising interest rates, reducing the amount of cash and credit available. Fed board members have also been on the stump, talking tough about keeping prices in check. If effective, such efforts could ease pressure for even higher rates just as the economy appears to be flagging.",

It is another important milestone for an amazingly durable spacecraft, which has already explored Jupiter and Saturn and may well keep returning data until its power runs out in about 2020. Scientists are not yet sure whether Voyager 1 has really entered the boundary region known as termination shock, where the electrically charged particles of the solar wind slow abruptly. This is largely because the instrument that measures solar wind speed has conked out. From indirect measurements, one group of scientists believes that the spacecraft has indeed reached this boundary, while another team believes that it is not quite there yet. Either way, Voyager 1, now more than eight billion miles from Earth, has traveled farther than any other human-made object. It is trailed by Voyager 2, an identical spacecraft launched on a different path in the same year, 1977.",

Homer, an out-of-work director of a local community center in Maine, first heard that NASA was turning to America's backyard inventors to brainstorm new technologies for a possible return to the moon, he had an idea. With NASA sponsoring seven design contests for everything from a new lunar lander to a new space glove, anybody with a home-brewed invention could enter. Homer's previous jobs included some gigs in the aerospace industry as well as work sewing boat sails. So, Homer told me not long ago, he ruled out building a flying spacecraft but decided that ''the glove contest represented something of the scale I could achieve working out of my home by myself.'' He'd always been a garage tinkerer, he said, and being unemployed, he also wanted to prove to his 14-year-old son ''that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.'' Oh, he added offhandedly, ''the money is a motivator, too.'' At stake was a prize -- presented with one of those giant cardboard checks -- for $200,000.",

This week, the agency announced plans to establish a permanent base on the Moon by 2024, explained why we should want to send astronauts back to a world they visited repeatedly more than three decades ago, and described what they might do when they get there. It was belated justification for a decision that the Bush administration and Congress have already made. But the payoff is distant and the likely future costs very high, leaving it unclear how realistic these aspirations will prove to be. The agency has done a commendably thorough job by consulting some 1,000 experts and 13 other space agencies in fashioning its plans. Such a costly and difficult venture should ideally be pursued cooperatively with other nations, to share the costs and the risks. It would be especially desirable to have multiple ways of reaching the Moon in case the American program runs into problems like those that grounded the shuttles.",

Urban areas can be as much as 20 degrees hotter than nearby rural ones, a result, among other factors, of all that concrete and asphalt pumping out heat as sunlight hits it. Sweltering temperatures affect humans, of course, but are there other biological consequences of what are known as urban heat islands? A study by Michael J. Angilletta Jr. of Indiana State University and colleagues shows that there is. Urban ants, they report in PLoS Biology, can stand the heat better than those from out of town.",

One by one, we filed into a silver-domed observatory and climbed a ladder to look into the lens of a 20-inch telescope named Rachel, one of the largest refractors in the western United States open to the public. Tonight's target was M-15, a group of about 250,000 stars almost 40,000 light-years away. To put it into mind-boggling perspective, one light-minute is equal to a little more than 11 million miles, and despite this almost unfathomable distance, M-15 is still within the Milky Way. This age-old human fascination with our place in an infinite universe is the foundation upon which the new $76 million, 86,000-square-foot Chabot Space and Science Center was built. It is one of the premier astronomy and space museums in the country, with exhibits, equipment and science programs that have earned it an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The center opened in August and is still a work in progress, but what is currently available will satisfy the most ardent stargazer.",

Forecasters predict that the weather will improve in time for a landing in Florida today. If they are wrong, NASA can send the shuttle to land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., or reschedule the landing for Sunday at an Air Force landing strip at White Sands, N.M. The space agency wants to avoid a California landing not only because it would cost $1 million to transport the shuttle back to Florida, but also because it could delay the ship's next mission.

It has detected extremely faint objects that can't be seen from the Earth, calibrated the age and expansion rate of the universe, detected supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and generally helped revolutionize our understanding of the universe. A distinguished panel of astronomers judged that Hubble ''has arguably had a greater impact on astronomy than any instrument since the original astronomical telescope of Galileo.'' Yet now, just as Hubble was scheduled for a major rejuvenation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has consigned it to slow death. The agency has canceled a planned servicing mission that would have upgraded Hubble's instruments and extended its life past the end of the decade, making it likely that the telescope will run out of battery power and functioning gyroscopes by about 2007.

He wants the academy to focus on ways to extend Hubble's usefulness that do not require a visit by astronauts. The administrator's reluctance makes it imperative that Congress insist on a full-scale analysis of the risks and benefits of servicing the Hubble, and that the academy refuse to undertake anything less. The premature termination of such a valuable scientific instrument is too important a decision to be left solely to an administrator who announced the cancellation without warning in January and has yet to justify the decision adequately.",

Dr. Steinbaum is an astronomer, professor of astronomy and science education at Iona College here, and the recently retired director of space science for the New Rochelle school system. He is also the author of ''The Star of Bethlehem,'' a planetarium show, which marks its 28th season this month. The show, which runs about an hour and a half, is a melange of star projections (the pinpoints of light that represent stars, planets and other heavenly bodies in planetariums), slides, music and narration. It will be presented at New Rochelle High School, free of charge, on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week and Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week, all at 8 P.M.

Bumblebees were thought to guard information about food sources, like a New Yorker who has discovered a great hole-in-the-wall restaurant and doesn't want it to get overrun. But new research by scientists from the University of Wurzburg in Germany shows that bumblebees aren't that tight-lipped. By carefully controlling which insects in a nest were able to search for food and what they were able to find, the researchers discovered that a returning bumblebee tells its mates about the type of flower it found. It just doesn't reveal the location.",

It encountered liquid lakes on the moon Titan, water ice and a particle plume on the moon Enceladus, ridges and ripples on the rings, and cyclones at Saturn's poles. Cassini also released a European space probe that landed on Titan. And Cassini has sent back enough data to produce more than 1,400 scientific papers -- at last count.",

The researchers, from Oregon State University, have been studying the decline in aspen groves in the park, using historical documents, aerial photographs and ring-dating. As they report in the journal Biological Conservation, they determined that for more than a century and a half, until the late 1920's, young trees were able to survive and mature within existing groves. Things changed around the time that the wolves in and around the park were eliminated (the last wolves were seen in 1926).",

So as investigators try to determine how the shuttle Columbia was lost, space debris is a suspect. Some 84 percent of the known debris -- about 8,000 pieces of detritus left from every old satellite or used-up booster rocket launched since Sputnik in 1957 -- lies more than 500 miles up, twice as high as the orbit of the International Space Station, according to officials of the Air Force Space Command, which maps space debris. That is ordinarily the highest altitude the shuttles reach. On scientific missions like the Columbia's, the orbiter flies about 180 miles high.",

They were not stars, he soon realized, but satellites that orbit the giant planet in much the same way the planets themselves travel around the Sun. The discovery finally demolished the human conceit that Earth is the center of the solar system, even the universe. On Sunday, a spacecraft named for the Italian astronomer completed its two-year primary mission of orbiting Jupiter, bringing the four moons into sharper focus, and now it is about to get even closer looks. What were to Galileo moving specks of light -- Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto -- stand revealed as surprisingly disparate worlds promising more discoveries about nature's capacity for infinite variety.",

It has produced campaign funding abuses, serious American security lapses and now a political furor in Washington less than a month before President Clinton is to make the first Presidential visit to China since 1989. Some American association with the Chinese Army is essential to stabilizing relations with China. High-level meetings, officer exchange programs and other links can reduce tensions and mistrust. But while China is not an enemy, it is not an ally either, and caution is required to insure that sensitive American military technology is not transferred. In its eagerness to improve relations with Beijing and expand American commerce in China, the White House has been careless about enforcing security protections.",

Take the oriental army worm caterpillar, Mythimna separata, which infests corn plants. During the day, the bugs hide underground or tucked behind a leaf where it joins the stalk. At night, they emerge and munch away on the plant. So the army worm is nocturnal, and it's a good thing, too: that helps it avoid being infested by a parasitic wasp, Cotesia kariyai, that is attracted to corn plants during the day. There's only one problem. Researchers in Japan have discovered what makes the army worm nocturnal, and it's not light -- at least not directly.",
