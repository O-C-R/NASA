NASA announced that it had rescheduled for July 1997 Space Shuttle Columbia’s Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, cut short in early April because of a fuel cell problem. The quick repair and relaunch plan used the same crew and set the same objectives as the initial Mission STS-83. Space Shuttle Program Manager Thomas W. Holloway stated, “we are now in the position to do everything possible to complete the MSL mission with minimal impact to downstream flights.” He also pointed out that the attempt to complete the MSL mission provided NASA with a “unique opportunity to demonstrate our ability to respond to challenges.” In its decision to insert Columbia’s Mission STS-83 into an already arranged Shuttle docket, NASA acknowledged that it would have to push back slightly other flights, already staffed and planned.(NASA, “Microgravity Science Laboratory Mission Set for July; Remaining 1997 Shuttle Manifest Adjusted Slightly,” news release 97-81, 25 April 1997; Seth Borenstein, “Space Shuttle Columbia Gets Chance To Finish What It Started,” Orlando Sentinel (FL), 18 April 1997.)
