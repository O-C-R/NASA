The hydrogen leak that was detected in the Space Shuttle Atlantis reappeared, and engineers determined that the Shuttle would have to be taken off the launch pad and rolled back to the hanger for a closer look. Columbia, undergoing repairs for a similar leak, was expected to be on the launch pad early in August. The Atlantis liftoff with its classified military payload were rescheduled for November, bumping another launch into 1991 (#and reducing the projected number of flights in 1990 to seven.

NASA granted a small Alexandria firm, Global Outpost, rights to find ways of using empty Space Shuttle fuel tanks, used to carry 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen for Space Shuttle launch and initial insertion into orbit, as a platform for military, civilian, and commercial experiments. The agreement followed a June 1988 NASA announcement requesting commercial and academic uses for expended tanks. (W Times, Jan 29/90; NASA Release 9014)
NASA announced the selection of two payload specialists for the International Microgravity Laboratory mission aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, scheduled for launch in December 1990. Dr. Roberta Bondar of the Canadian Space Agency and Dr. Ulf Merbold of the European Space Agency were to conduct the first of several microgravity investigations using the Spacelab Module.

A fuel leak that postponed Space Shuttle Columbia's
NASA took the Space Shuttle Columbia off its schedule for 1990 launches, operating under the assumption that the orbiter was prone to fuel leaks. Still unable to pinpoint the exact location of the last hydrogen leak, NASA hoped that the craft would be able to fly in early 1991. A team of nine engineers was working on the problem.

The Ulysses spacecraft launched from Space Shuttle Discovery and developed a problem on its trip to rendezvous with Jupiter in 1992, from which it would slingshot to achieve polar orbit around the Sun. It was believed that the difficulty came from a 241/2foot antenna boom meant to study radio signals in space and waves in the solar winds. Scientists ascertained that the boom was bent, perhaps from the Sun's rays, and was causing the craft to wobble. Because of the wobble, the main dishshaped antenna would not be able to focus on Earth and relay data gleaned from the star. Scientists were confident that the problem would be solved before the craft's 1994 mission began. (C Trib''0*Dec 15/90; NY Times, Dec 16/90)
Two Space Shuttle crew commanders were grounded by NASA for disciplinary reasons. Robert L. Gibson was grounded for one year after he flew a stunt plane, in a July 7Texas air show, that collided with another plane and killed the second pilot. David M. Walker was grounded for 60 days because the T38 jet aircraft he piloted in May 1989 nearly collided with a Pan Am Airbus 310 over Dulles Airport, according to the second pilot.

Columbia's flight in early January, NASA announced, was made with a flawed backup oring inspectors had overlooked. A disaster similar to the Challenger accident 4 years previously could have occurred if the primary seal had failed. Inspectors also missed inferior welds on a critical pump that supplied one of the Atlantis main engines with fuel. The problem was0*corrected while on the launch pad in preparation for the upcoming
NASA signed an agreement to support the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) study of the feasibility of using the Shuttle's external tanks as research, storage, or manufacturing facilities. Space Shuttle fuel tanks were used to carry 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen for launch and initial insertion into orbit. The agreement followed a June 1988 NASA announcement requesting commercial and academic uses for expended tanks. (NASA Release 9026)
NASA declared its Shuttle fleet "leak free" as Columbia passed a fueling test after two defective seals had been replaced and nuts and connectors in the engine compartment had been tightened. Space Shuttle Atlantis had passed its fuel test a week earlier and was scheduled for liftoff November 9. (NY Times, Oct 31/90; W Post, Oct 31/90; NASA Release N9086)
Launching of the Shuttle Atlantis and deployment of a classified payload mission on February 22 were canceled because the mission Commander had a sore throat and headache, coupled with the prediction of wind and rain over Cape Canaveral, Florida. This was the first time a NASA mission had been scrubbed because of crew illness. (NY Times, Feb 22/90; Feb 23/90; W Post; Feb 22/90)
