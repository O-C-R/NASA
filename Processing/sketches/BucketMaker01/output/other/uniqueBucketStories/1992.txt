NASA released to Congress a report on the Restructuring of the Earth Observation System (EOS). The system is the centerpiece of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a coordinated program to study the Earth's environment as a complete global system and is composed of two series of spacecraft to collect data over 15 years. "The restructured EOS program meets the concerns for a less costly more flexible program while maintaining the science observations needed to support global change research," said Dr. Lennard A. Fisk, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications. (NASA Note N92-22)
