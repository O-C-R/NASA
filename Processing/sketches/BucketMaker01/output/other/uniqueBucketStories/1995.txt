NASA has collaborated with WGBH-TV, Boston, and Scholastic, Inc., New York, to produce an interactive videodisc �Interactive NOVA: Earth� that allows students to go on electronic field trips to remote areas to find clues of how life began on Earth. NASA�s Offices of Mission to Planet Earth and Human Resources and Education contributed to this effort by providing data, visualizations, and other video resources as well as by actively participating in the current development through the involvement of key Agency researchers.
