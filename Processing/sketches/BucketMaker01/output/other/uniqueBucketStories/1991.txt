Peter J. Wylie, professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology, commended NASA's mapping of Venus but stated that only 29 percent of the Earth's surface has been mapped in detail. He suggested that NASA's Mission to Planet Earth take the form of an integrated space-borne and ground-based mission that could map the remaining 71 percent of the surface beneath the ocean.
