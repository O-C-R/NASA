detail of a young star system known as 30 Doradus, 160,000 light years from Earth. After scientists corrected the flawed mirror problem with computer enhancement, the telescope revealed 60 of what were yet the youngest and heaviest stars known. The "star nursery," was once thought to have only one large star; the most advanced telescope prior to the Hubble telescope had raised that number to 27.

The Galileo spacecraft came to within 590 miles of Earth and received a push from Earth's gravity that increased its speed from 67,000 m.p.h. to 78,000 m.p.h. This was the first of two gravity assisted passes by Earth that were planned for the craft, enabling it to reach Jupiter in December 1995. It collected numerous data from Earth, as it would again on its second pass. (CSM Dec 10/90; NY Times, Dec 9/90)
The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee recommended an increase of NASA's budget from $12.3 billion to $17 billion for the next year, including the $2.9 billion earmarked for continued development of the Space Station. Committee members acknowledged that the final spending plan would probably be lower but wanted to show their support despite NASA's recent problems. (P Inq, Sep 20/90)
NASA announced its Integrated System Preliminary Design Review for Space Station Freedom was completed. Preliminary figures for June 1990 showed Freedom's weight to be 143,000 pounds lighter than the allocated limit of 512,000 pounds and that the housekeeping power limit of 45 kilowatts was exceeded by 15 kilowatts. A summerlong resources scrub reduced weight estimates by 130,000 pounds and housekeeping power by 13 kilowatts. "What this means," said Deputy Manager Marc Bensimon, "is that the design is maturing and converging." (NASA Release During December: NASA awarded contracts to Centennial Contractors, SPACEHAB, and Dyncorp. Centennial was given a '(0*year $5 million contract for various minor constructions, modifications, and rehabilitation projects at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, SPACEHAB received a 5year $184,236,000 contract for providing commercial middeck augmentation module services: physical and operational integration of the module and the experiments; power, cooling, data management; and crew training in six Space Shuttle flights at sixmonth intervals. Dyncorp procured a $30 million contract for technical services that included operation and maintenance of radar, telecommunications, and optical services.

The Hubble Telescope failed a test on this date as scientists attempted to direct it toward stars emanating a common brightness; the telescope was able to find none. It was later discovered that the problem originated from an error in the telescopes computer guidance system, and a new program with an updated star chart was sent up.
