At the request of the National Space Council, President George Bush restored funding for continued operation of two Landsat satellites and the launching of a third. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had earlier decided to deactivate the Landsats because of a shortfall of $5 million in fiscal year 1989 funding for the program. (WSJ, Jun 2/89)
An ESA Ariane 2 launch vehicle was successfully launched from the Kourou launch facility in French Guiana. The Ariane 2 carried the TELEX Nordic communications satellite into a preliminary elliptical orbit, from where it subsequently boosted itself into a 22,300mile geosynchronous orbit.

A European Space Agency Ariane 2 launch vehicle was successfully launched from the Kourou launch center in French Guiana. The Ariane 2 carried a twoton IntelsatV telecommunications satellite. (SSR 1989 006AB; W Times, Jan 27/89)
The Solar Maximum (Solar Max) satellite tumbled out of orbit and reentered the Earth's atmosphere, spreading small amounts of debris over the Indian Ocean. The satellite had been launched in
The Coloradobased Energetics Satellite Corporation announced that it had completed an agreement with the Soviet Union's civilian space agency, Glavkosmos, to launch two U.S.built commercial satellites on Soviet boosters. The contract provided for the launching of two geosynchronous satellites at a cost of $6.5 million each, with an option to add six more satellite launches in the future. The total potential value of the agreement was $54 million for the eightsatellite launch option. (W Post, Nov 16/89; NY Times, Nov 17/89)
After several delays, an ESA Ariane 4 launch vehicle was successfully launched from the Kourou launch center in French Guiana. The 195foot Ariane 4 carried Japan's first commercial communications satellite and a European weather station into low Earth orbits, from where the two satellites would later boost themselves into 22,300mile geosynchronous orbits. This was the third launch of the new Ariane 4 launch vehicle, one of the most powerful boosters available for commercial satellite launches. (SSR 1989 020AD; UPI, Mar 6/89)
The first major privatesector launch of a satellite was delayed by several months as a result of a launch pad accident that damaged the satellite. A communications satellite owned by the government of India was seriously damaged when it was accidentally struck by a lift hook connected to a crane. The satellite was being prepared for launch at a McDonnell Douglas facility at Cape Canaveral, Florida. (W Post, Jun 27/89; O Sent Star, Jun 21/89)
The National Weather Service's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite6 (GOES6) ceased to function,0*creating a temporary gap in U.S. satellite weather coverage. The 6yearold GOES6, which had surpassed its expected operational lifetime by a year, was to be temporarily replaced by a similar satellite already in orbit. The GOES7 satellite was to be shifted eastward to cover the entire United States until a permanent replacement, GOESI, was launched in 1990.

An ESA Ariane 3 launch vehicle carrying an experimental communications satellite was successfully launched from the Kourou launch facility in French Guiana. The 161foot Ariane 3 placed the European Olympus 1 satellite in a preliminary orbit from which it would boost itself into a 22,300mile geosynchronous orbit over the equator.

After an aborted attempt in August, an H1 launch vehicle carrying a GMS4 weather satellite was successfully launched by Japan's National Space Development Agency. (FBISEas89173, Sep 8/89; SSR 1989 070 AC; WSJ, Sep 7/89)
An ESA Ariane 4 launch vehicle was successfully launched from the Kourou launch facility in French Guiana, carrying two communications satellites. The 192foot Ariane 4 was carrying a SuperbirdA communications satellite owned by Japan and a West German DFS Kopernikus1 television relay satellite. This was the 27th successful launch by Arianespace and the fourth successful launch of the new Ariane 4 launch vehicle. (FBISWeu89107; SSR 1989 041AD; UPI, Jun 5/89; P Inq, Jun 6/89)
