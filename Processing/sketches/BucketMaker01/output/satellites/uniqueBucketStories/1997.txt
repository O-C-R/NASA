Data gathered by the U.S.-French satellite TOPEX/Poseidon confirmed theories that a “full- blown El Niño condition” existed in the Pacific. Scientists believe that an El Niño forms when steady, westward-blowing trade winds weaken or reverse direction, altering typical, atmospheric jet-stream patterns around the world. TOPEX/Poseidon measured sea-surface heights and atmospheric water vapor to confirm the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s earlier prediction. Based on previous El Niño events, scientists predicted heavy rainfall for the western United States, mild winters in the east, and extreme droughts in Australia, Africa, and Indonesia.(NASA, “Independent NASA Satellite Measurements Confirm El Niño Is Back and Strong,” news release 97-200, 15 September 1997.)
