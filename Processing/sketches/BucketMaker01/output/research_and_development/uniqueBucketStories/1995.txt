A natural laser in space was detected coming from a young, very hot, luminous star in the constellation Cygnus. The laser was created as intense ultraviolet light from the star excites the densely packed hydrogen atoms in the gaseous, dusty disk surrounding the star. When infrared light shines on the excited hydrogen atoms, it causes the atoms to emit an intense beam of light at exactly the same wavelength, creating the circumstellar laser. This natural laser was detected on NASA�s Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) during missions based on Hawaii. The existence of such natural lasers was predicted more than 15 years ago.

A fully automated landing of a transport aircraft was made using only engine thrust for control. Landing was a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 using a Propulsion Controlled Aircraft (PCA) system at NASA�s Dryden Flight Research Center. PCA is expected to become an important back-up system in the event of a loss of an aircraft�s hydraulic flight control system. (NASA Release 95-149; Fla Today, Sep 24/95; AvWk, Sep 4/95)
During an occultation of the comet Chiron and a star, an airborne NASA observatory was used to help determine the size of this comet that orbits like a planet(in a nearly circular orbit(in our solar system. According to an international team of scientists, Chiron is between 103 and 193 miles in diameter and 20 times the size of Halley�s comet. The Kuiper Airborne Observatory flew near Recife, Brazil on this project. Chiron orbits the Sun once in 50 years. (NY Times, Jan 10/95; UPI, Jan 6/95)
Remote control technology and the Internet are expected to play major parts in the operation of the South Pole Infrared Explorer telescope and the Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory, both in Antarctica. These instruments were built and are operated by the Center for the Astrophysical Research in Antarctica, a consortium of universities and research laboratories supported mostly by the  National Science Foundation.  Astronomers will be able to control these instruments from any place in the world with an Internet or modem connection. (NY Times, Jan 10/95)
NASA astronomers said that a stellar object that erupted last summer with powerful bursts of X-rays and jets of hot gas at near the speed of light may be a black hole or possibly a neutron star in the act of gobbling up a companion star. The object, a relatively close 10,000 light-years from Earth, was discovered in July when it exploded with flashes of the most powerful natural X-rays in the heavens. The radiation was detected by NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. (AP, Jan 12/95)
The "New York Times" reported that University of Illinois atmospheric scientists had begun this month aiming a powerful laser beam into the atmosphere above the South Pole, expecting to illuminate many details about the deletion of the global ozone layer. The scientists hoped that the laser will help them create continuous three-dimensional maps of the chemical composition and physical details of the atmosphere throughout the year.

A 94-percent scale model of Boeing�s proposed Joint Advanced Strike Technology Fighter (JAST), now under construction, is planned to begin using the 80 by 120 foot wind tunnel at the Ames Research Center in early 1996. (AvWk, Mar 6/95)
An historic wind tunnel at NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia is being retired. Originally called the �Full Scale Tunnel� when built in 1931, it was the largest wind tunnel in the world until 1945. (NASA Release 95-194; AvWk, Nov 20/95)
In experiments aimed at answering one of the most intriguing questions in particle physics and cosmology, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico produced especially strong evidence that elusive particles called neutrinos do indeed have mass. If proven, the finding means that neutrinos could constitute a major component of the mysterious invisible matter, the long-sought missing mass, that cosmologists think fills and shapes the universe and could dictate its fate. Finding a mass for the ubiquitous neutrino would help toward completing an inventory of the missing matter, a tally that will determine whether the universe will fly apart, fall in on itself, or settle on a middle path. D. Hywel White, leader of the research team, said that the most likely explanation for the observed behavior of neutrinos produced by a proton accelerator was that these particles have some as yet undetermined amount of mass.

A device invented at NASA�s Langley Research Center may protect homeowners everywhere from deadly carbon monoxide fumes. It uses a new class of low-temperature oxidation catalysts to convert carbon monoxide to non-toxic carbon dioxide at room temperature. It also can remove formaldehyde gas. (NASA Release 95-218)
NASA selected 30 research proposals for negotiation of Phase I contracts as part of the 1995 Small Business Technology Transfer Pilot Program (STTR), which is one of the ways that NASA takes the knowledge gained in air and space exploration an transfers it to the public. Companies that successfully complete Phase I activities are eligible to compete for Phase II awards the following year. The Phase II award allows for two-year, fixed-price contracts of up to $500,000. (NASA Release 95-103)
Scientists at the University of Chicago advanced a new theory explaining the "mass extinctions" of living species that have occurred on Earth, the most famous being that of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.  They theorized that supernovas burned off the Earth's ozone layer and caused the sun's rays to flood the surface with deadly radiation.  The theory borrows from work done on the effect of ozone depletion in Antarctica.  Scientists estimate that five mass extinctions have occurred on Earth, one every 120 million years.

A team of national geologists working with NASA scientists dropped a 700-pound weight on a jumbled mound of rock in Canyonlands National Park in Utah in an attempt to determine whether Upheaval Dome is a badly eroded salt dome or the remnants of a 5-mile-diameter meteorite impact crater. Earlier studies of shattered rocks and quartz crystals had already convinced many researchers that an asteroid or comet fragment slammed into southeast Utah sometime between five and 100 million years ago. Impact craters such as Upheaval dome are common in the solar system, so the geologists were attempting to learn how such craters form. (Salt Lake City Tribune, Jan 10/95)
A prototype of the Cockpit Weather Information Needs (CWIN) concept developed by Langley Research Center is being installed on a United DC-10-10. It will be operated for at least three months on scheduled, revenue flights to evaluate the cost and safety benefits. Initially the weather data will be limited to a nationaly radar summary and an air-to-ground lightning map. NASA has plans to add terminal forecasts and sruface observations. (AvWk, Jul 31/95)
Large-scale conceptual models of the X-32 Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter are scheduled to begin at the Ames Research Center this summer and continue through the summer of 1996. The idea for the X-32, which could be introduced into service around 2010, is to have two versions. One would be a conventional take-off and landing aircraft. The second version would be much as the first, except configured for short take-offs and vertical landings. They would share a common fuselage and engine, while a powered-lift propulsion system would be used for vertical landings. (NASA Release 95-4)
Data collected from a NASA airborne observatory fitted with a 36-inch telescope helped astronomers estimate the size of the largest known comet, Chiron.  Chiron is between 100 and 187 miles in diameter, 20 times the size of Haley's comet. (AP, Jan 8/95)
