NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin named Lori B. Garver as Associate Administrator for NASA’s Office of Policy and Plans, effective immediately. Garver had served as Acting Associate Administrator since September 1998. She had begun working for NASA in 1996 as Special Assistant to the Administrator. Before joining NASA, she had been Executive Director of the National Space Society, since 1987, and a president of Women in Aerospace. Goldin remarked that Garver’s experience inside and outside NASA had “proven invaluable,” and that she had demonstrated the management skills and policy leadership that her new position required.(NASA, “Garver Named Associate Administrator for Policy and Plans,” news release 99-6, 25 January 1999.)
