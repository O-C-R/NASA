It was expected that artificial intelligence would be used to develop automated systems for all phases of space missions, from launch to mission control and for onboard operations. Artificial intelligence technology would also be used to advance spacecraft performance and safety, and would free astronauts from routine chores. Research in artificial intelligence and the development of automated system would be a joint effort between the Information Science Division, other NASA Centers, private industry, and academic institutions.
