NASA announced that Armadillo Aerospace of Rockwell, Texas, had won a US$350,000 prize during the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Sponsored by NASA’s Centennial Challenges program and managed by the X Prize Foundation, the Lunar Lander Challenge was a two-level competition to foster innovation in commercial space technology. Armadillo had won the first level with a vehicle demonstrating some of the technologies that a lunar lander would require to transport payloads or astronauts between lunar orbit and the lunar surface. Armadillo’s vehicle had risen to a height of 50 meters (164.04 feet); traveled to a landing pad 100 meters (328.08 feet) away, while staying in the air for at least 90 seconds; landed; and later repeated the flight. Armadillo’s attempt at Level Two, which was more challenging, had not succeeded, leaving US$1.65 million in unawarded prize money that NASA would make available for future competitions. In the past, the Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge had been a key event at the X Prize Cup; however, the X Prize Foundation had dramatically scaled back X Prize Cup events in 2008, because of budgetary constraints and scheduling conflicts.(NASA, “NASA $350,000 Prize Goes to Armadillo Aerospace in Lunar Challenge,” new release 08-271, 27 October 2008; http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/oct/HQ_08-271_Armadillo_Challenge.html (accessed 8 August 2011); Jose L.

2,423.09 kilograms) two Solar Alpha Rotary Joints that allow the ISS’s solar arrays to follow the Sun. Although an astronaut had lost an untethered tool belt during the first spacewalk, the repairs appeared to have been successful. Astronaut Gregory E. Chamitoff, who had been aboard the ISS for over five months, had returned to Earth on board Endeavour. Sandra H. Magnus had replaced Chamitoff on the ISS. She expected to stay until February 2009.(NASA, “NASA’s Shuttle Endeavour Glides Home After Successful Mission,” news release 08-315, 30 November 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08-315_Endeavour_lands.html (accessed 22 August 2011); Robert Z.

NASA announced that it had awarded a sole-source contract to Hamilton Sundstrand Space Systems International of Windsor Locks, Connecticut, to provide a water-production system aboard the ISS. Under the terms of the contract, Hamilton Sundstrand would provide equipment that would use excess carbon dioxide and hydrogen on the ISS to produce water and methane, using a chemical process called a Sabatier reaction. The ISS’s waste-water system would treat the water produced in this process, so that the astronauts could use it for drinking, washing, preparing food, generating oxygen, and cooling electronic equipment. NASA planned to send the equipment to the ISS aboard mission STS-130, scheduled for launch in 2009. Officials hoped that the water-production system would pave the way for other new technologies that NASA could use in future missions traveling too far from the Earth for routine resupply. The contract represented a change in NASA’s business arrangements. Instead of purchasing the hardware for water production, NASA had contracted only for the production of services. The contractor had agreed to be responsible for all system development and performance. The contract, which 47 would extend through 30 September 2014, could reach a value of as much as US$65 million.
