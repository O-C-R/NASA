NASA�s telescope on its Kuiper Airborne Laboratory has begun to examine the chemical composition of Mercury, which is the least understood of the four terrestrial planets-Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Flying at 41,000 feet, the specially outfitted C-141 military transport plane is able to detect invisible infrared radiation that is refracted and reflected by the planet�s surface rocks. While nothing startling was immediately about the planet�s surface, weeks or months of analysis are likely to turn up new information about Mercury. (NY Times, May 16/95; Fla Today, Jul, 9/95)
The Mars robot, that will land around July 4, 1997, will be named after �Sojourner� Truth, who advocated the right for all people to be free. (NASA Release 95-112; NY Times, Jul 16/95; AP, Jul 14/95)
