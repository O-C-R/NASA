The astronomers speculated that Saturn’s blue ring of small particles was the result of meteoroid impacts on the surface of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, impacts that had scattered debris into the moon’s orbit. The largest particles had remained within Enceladus’s orbit, but various forces, including pressure from sunlight, had pushed the smallest particles out of the moon’s orbit, causing Saturn’s broad ring of smaller scattered particles, which reflect predominantly blue light. De Pater explained that this explanation of the color of Saturn’s outer ring was directly applicable to the blue ring observed around Uranus. However, he cautioned that astronomers did not yet “understand the details of the process.”(Robert Sanders, “Blue Ring Discovered Around Uranus,” University of California at Berkeley press release, 6 April 2006, http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/04/ 06_bluering.shtml (accessed 25 June 2010); see also Imke de Pater et al., “New Dust Belts of Uranus: One Ring, Two Ring, Red Ring, Blue Ring,” Science 312, no. 5770 (7 April 2006): 92−94.)
Scientists published research on the dimmest stars ever observed in a globular star cluster, including findings that revealed important information about the universe’s age and provided supporting evidence for a theory of star transformation. Harvey B. Richer of the University of British Columbia, and his team of scientists, had used NASA’s HST to observe faint light from white dwarf stars in the cluster NGC 6397. Astronomers often make estimates of the universe’s age based on the age of stars. They are able to determine the age of stars because stars decline in temperature as they exhaust their available energy over their lifetimes. White dwarf stars, which are burned-out relics of stars and cool at predictable rates, are particularly useful for this purpose. However, white dwarves also become less visible as their radiation declines. According to the team’s observations of the light from the white dwarves in NGC 6397, the cluster is almost 12 billion years old. The light from the cluster’s white dwarf stars appears as faint as the light of a birthday candle on the Moon would appear to an observer on Earth. The HST images also revealed that the dimmest white dwarf stars in NGC 6397 have temperatures low enough to cause chemical changes in their atmospheres, making the stars appear blue rather than red. Scientists had theorized the existence of this phenomenon but had never observed it.
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced the official naming of Pluto’s newest small moons—Nix and Hydra, names from Greek mythology. The HST had discovered Nix and Hydra, previously known as S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2, in May 2005. The two moons are approximately 5,000 times fainter than Pluto and approximately two to three times farther from Pluto than its larger moon Charon, discovered in 1978. The first initials of the two moons—N and H—are the same as the initials of the NASA spacecraft New Horizons, which launched in January 2006 toward the Pluto system. Scientists expected that New Horizons would map Nix and Hydra in detail when the spacecraft flew by Pluto in summer 2015.(Kenneth Chang, “Moons of Pluto Renamed,” New York Times, 23 June 2006; NASA, “Pluto and Its Moons: Charon, Nix and Hydra,” 23 June 2006, http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/plutos_moons_prt.htm (accessed 23 August 2010).)
ESA ended its Small Mission for Advanced Research in Technology (SMART-1) with a planned crash landing of the SMART-1 spacecraft into the Moon. The spacecraft impacted at a speed of 4,500 miles per hour (nearly 7,200 kilometers per hour) in a volcanic plain called the Lake of Excellence. ESA had planned the crash so that scientists could study the composition of the resulting dust and debris. SMART-1 had launched on 27 September 2003, orbiting the Moon many times to acquire data about the chemical and mineralogical composition of the lunar surface. ESA had also used the mission to test deep-space communications techniques, autonomous spacecraft–navigation techniques, and other innovative technologies, such as an ion- propulsion engine and various miniaturized instruments.
