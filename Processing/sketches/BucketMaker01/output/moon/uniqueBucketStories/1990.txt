Japan launched a lunar probe from Uchinoura, on their southern coast, making it the third nation, after the United States and the Soviet Union, able to send up a moon probe. The flight schedule was to go into elliptical orbit around the Earth until it came within 10,000 miles of the Moon, launch an instrument package to orbit the moon, and send back data concerning temperatures and electrical fields.
