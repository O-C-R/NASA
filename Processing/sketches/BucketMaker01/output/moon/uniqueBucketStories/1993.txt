NASA announced that the Clementine mission to orbit the moon and to visit an asteroid would be headed by Dr. Eugene Shoemaker of the U.S. Geologic Survey, Flagstaff, Arizona. Clementine, sponsored by the Strategic Defense Initiative Office (SDIO), was scheduled to launch a small spacecraft in January 1994 to orbit the moon for several months. The mission would test new, lightweight sensors in a space radiation environment and demonstrate autonomous navigation and spacecraft operation. (NASA Release 93-66)
