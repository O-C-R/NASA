A lengthy account in the New York Times dealing with asteroids and the threat they posed to early life as well as the continuing possibility they might destroy Earth, referred to NASA's findings about early life forms based on a survey of impact craters on the moon. Several scientists' findings, discussed in the journal Cell, were also reported. The newspaper also published an article citing NASA's expenditure of somewhat less than $1 million a year to search for Earth-crossing asteroids. NASA reportedly was also studying the feasibility of nudging asteroids aside and in this connection is to help sponsor the first International Conference on Near-Earth Asteroids. (NYT, Jun 18/91)
