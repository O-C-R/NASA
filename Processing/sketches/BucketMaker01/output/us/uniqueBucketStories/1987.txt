The panel, headed by retired Air Force General Alton D. Slay, praised NASA's toptobottom review of hundreds of items and procedures that could cause another disaster. It added, however, that several analyses of possible equipment failure and of items considered critical to safety would not be completed until the summer of 1987. The panel recommended that NASA rank the most critical safety items, based on the likelihood of their failure, and that it closely link the engineering changes and the hazard analyses.

NASA Assistant Administrator for Commercial Programs Isaac T. Gillam named 28 teams that have submitted proposals to establish Centers for the Commercial Development of Space. The objective of the Centers would be to stimulate research in the microgravity environment of space. This research was expected to lead the development of new products that have commercial value. The proposed research fields include space power, space propulsion, remote sensing, communication technology, and bioscience. The overwhelming majority of the proposals came from American universities. (NASA Release 8769)
NASA announced an international joint effort to investigate ozone depletion over the Antarctic. NASA was to be joined in this effort by other Federal science agencies; the Chemical Manufacturers Association; scientists from Harvard University, the University of Denver, and the University of Washington; and the governments of Argentina, Chile, France, Great Britain, and New Zealand. A specially equipped ER2 plane and a modified DC8 airliner were to make a number of flights through the ozone hole between August 17 and September 29, 1987, to see whether manmade chemicals, nature, or both are destroying the ozone. The findings will be examined by an international panel of policy makers meeting in Montreal, Canada, in September 1987. (NY Times, July 30/87; W Post, July 29/87; W Times, July 29/87)
