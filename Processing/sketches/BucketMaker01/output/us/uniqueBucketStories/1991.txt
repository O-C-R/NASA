The Defense Department lifted military secrecy from Shuttle missions, not because of decreased Soviet threat or the nature of the payload but because of the cost of security. The move was expected to save the government $80 million. Security would be applied more selectively because the Soviet Union and the American public were considered to be familiar with the nature of most space flights to date. Discovery would carry a payload known as Cirris, for Cryogenic Infrared Radiation Instrumentation for Shuttle, designed to determine the feasibility of the space-based detection of enemy aircraft and missiles.

The oldest B-52 bomber, which serves as a test-bed aircraft for the NASA Ames-Dryden facility at Edwards Air Force Base, and was built in 1952, may be facing retirement. Difficulties in obtaining spare parts were a major consideration according to Jack Levine, director of NASA's Flight Projects Division. NASA would like to substitute a newer B-52, such as the G model delivered in the early 1960s, for which spare parts are readily available. (Antelope Valley Press, Mar 24/91)
NASA announced that on June 29 its 114th Scout launch vehicle placed an Air Force Radiation Experiment into a 450 nautical mile polar orbit. The launch occurred from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and was delayed one day by bad weather. (NASA Release 91-102)
Findings presented at the American Astronomical Society's Division of Planetary Sciences conference suggested that Mercury had an ice cap on its north pole, even though it was the planet nearest the sun. The findings surprised the California Institute of Technology scientists who discovered them and were based on August experiments, the first radar photographs of an entire hemisphere of Mercury. The brightest reflection on the planet's north pole indicated a highly reflective substance such as ice over an area of an estimated 150 square miles.

NASA unveiled a three-dimensional view of Venus created from images recorded by the Magellan spacecraft. Magellan detected a five-mile high volcano known as Maat Mons, about the size of Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Kea.

The media covered preparations of the Discovery crew for the first Shuttle night landing at Cape Canaveral, scheduled for September 18. As it developed, the bad weather forced a diversion of the Shuttle from Florida, and the actual landing occurred the night of September 18 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Reportedly, preliminary findings were that the Shuttle was in good shape after its landing.

Jim Gunn, an astronomer at Princeton University and designer of equipment for the Digital Sky Survey, was planning a map of the universe that would fit in a desk drawer. Based on Gunn's work on the Hale telescope in California, the Sky Survey's 100-inch "smart" telescope would perch on top of the Sacramento Mountains in New Mexico.

Newsweek carried a feature article about NASA's discoveries regarding the heavens: quasars, galaxies, black holes, dark matter, and the like, as presented at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Special credit was given to the instruments NASA developed to explore space. The mysteries remaining to be explored were highlighted and the new telescopes being installed to catch infrared rays to help solve some of the mysteries. (Newsweek, Jun 3/91)
The Los Angeles Air Force Base at El Segundo was omitted from the list of proposed base closings of the Department of Defense. The base houses the Air Force Space Systems Division, a 3,200-employee unit that oversees military contracts for procurement of space hardware. (LA Times, Apr 13/91)
The press reported that NASA had staged a mock emergency landing in preparation for Columbia's touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base, California. (USA Today, Jun 14/91; AP, Jun 14/91)
Republican Congressman from California Tom Campbell said he would not object to the closing of a military installation in his district provided that it was "fair." In this connection he would not oppose the proposed closing of Moffett Field, from which NASA tests aircraft and spacecraft in wind tunnels and simulators and the Navy flies its P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare missions over the Pacific. Local officials and business people argued that closure of the field would cause Lockheed Missiles and Space Company to move elsewhere, taking its 25,000 employees, in addition to the some 12,200 jobs lost from the Navy.

The paper carried an article featuring Ali Abu Taha, whom it described as "telling NASA things it would rather not hear" over the preceding five years. He filed suit against NASA, Rockwell International (maker of the Shuttle's orbiter), and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. However, the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia rejected his three suits. (Washington City Paper, Oct 11/91)
At a press conference associated with the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle, Ted Stecher, Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT) Principal Investigator, announced that UIT team members had identified hundreds of newly found young stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Several of these hot stars might eventually become supernovas. (NASA Release 91-84)
The Astro three ultraviolet and one x-ray telescopes carried by Columbia showed no traces of the decay processes of tiny invisible particles known as neutrinos, it was announced at the American Astronomical Society conference.

Construction of NASA's Ames-Dryden Integrated Test Facility at Edwards Air Force Base was 18 months behind schedule and $3.1 over its original cost estimate because three successive contractors pulled out of the job, NASA said. Efforts were underway to find a new contractor. NASA spokesman Don Haley asserted that the construction delays had not hindered aircraft tests.

The New York Times reported that fuel cells, first developed for use in space in the 1960s, were being used increasingly in commercial plants. A fuel cell is a device that converts the energy of a fuel directly to electricity and heat, without combustion. The United States had developed an experimental plant in San Ramon, east of San Francisco, and other plants were considering use of the new technology. (NYT, Jun 30/91)
The New York Times reported that the United States would announce today at a scientific meeting in New Mexico its intention to buy an advanced Soviet nuclear reactor, known as Topaz 2, built to power systems in space. The United States at present has no working nuclear reactors in orbit and this purchase constitutes a high point in East-West cooperation on technical matters. Topaz 2 is designed to operate up to five years in space and will be set up in the Albuquerque area. It was to be tested by the University of New Mexico, the Sandia National Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Air Force Phillips Laboratory. The Topaz 2 can generate from 6,000 to 10,000 watts of electricity. (NY Times, Jan 7/91)
