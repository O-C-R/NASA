NASA announced the selection of General Electric, AstroSpace Division, Princeton, New Jersey, for negotiations leading to the award of a costplusawardfee contract for design, fabrication, instrument integration, and launch operation support of the Global Geospace Science (GGS) Wind and Polar missions. The two GGS laboratories, with their complement of scientific instruments, were to examine the flow of energy from the Sun through the Earth's geospace environment. This project was to be part of the overall scientific investigations within the International SolarTerrestrial Physics Program. The contract would provide for delivery of the Wind laboratory to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, for launch readiness on December 30, 1992, and delivery of the Polar laboratory to Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, for launch readiness on June 30, 1993. Each laboratory would be launched on a government`"furnished expendable launch vehicle. (NASA News, Nov 23/88)
NASA officially transferred custody of Launch Complex 17 and East Coast Delta launch operations to the U.S. Air Force. Since 1960, NASA had conducted 143 Delta launches from the twopad Complex, located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Under Air Force stewardship, Complex 17 would continue to be used to launch Delta medium class vehicles. The Air Force had procured 20 new Delta IIs for Department of Defense payloads. The first launch was scheduled for later in 1988. In addition, at least eight commercial Delta IIs would be launched by McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company, Huntington, Beach, California, from Complex 17 between 1989 and 1992.
