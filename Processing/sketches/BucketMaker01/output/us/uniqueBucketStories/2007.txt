NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and the American Helicopter Society (AHS) selected Eric Greenwood II—a graduate student at the University of Maryland, who was studying aerospace engineering with a specialty in rotorcraft acoustics—as the first winner of the
Scientists from MIT and researchers from the U.S. Air Force published a paper in the journal Science explaining their development of oil-repellant materials with aerospace applications. The scientists had used fibers from polymers, combined with a special class of molecules called fluoroPOSS, to create oil-repellant, or superoleophobic, surfaces. The scientists explained that engineers would be able to use the fluoroPOSS-polymer blend to protect parts of airplanes and rockets, such as rubber gaskets and O-rings, which are vulnerable to damage resulting from saturation in fuel.
Engineers successfully tested the main parachute for NASA’s Constellation Program rockets during a drop test at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Ground, validating the results of a test conducted in September. NASA had designed the parachute system to allow recovery and reuse of Ares-1 and Ares-5 first-stage boosters. A U.S. Air Force C-17 aircraft flying at an altitude of 16,500 feet (5,029 meters) dropped the main parachute, which measured 150 feet (46 meters) in diameter and weighed 2,000 pounds (907 kilograms). NASA had outfitted the main parachute with a 42,000-pound (19,051-kilogram) weight that simulated the load of the rocket’s first stage. The parachute and all supporting hardware functioned properly and landed safely 3 minutes after the drop.(NASA, “NASA Conducts Second Test of Main Parachute for Ares Rockets,” news release 07-254, 15 November 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/nov/HQ_07254_Ares_Yuma_Parachute_ Test.html (accessed 20 October 2010).)
