But a malfunctioning control system left the spacecraft far short of its intended landing site. Officials at Russia's mission control center here, north of Moscow, reported that rescue aircraft had been in contact with crew members in the last stages of the descent and after the capsule landed, but it took more than two hours to confirm that the crew was safe."
