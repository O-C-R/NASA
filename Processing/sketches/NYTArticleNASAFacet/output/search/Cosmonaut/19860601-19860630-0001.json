No, I am not using a clipped version of ''labor arbitrators,'' nor trying to pronounce ''Arabs'' in a single syllable, nor clandestinely using the acronym for Angle Rate Bombing System. The arbs are the arbitrageurs, who have taken the place of Bet-A-Million Gates in the corporate crapshoot. ''A call came in to Lehman Brothers from an arb and was transferred to me,'' said Dennis B. Levine to the Securities and Exchange Commission, before being charged with insider trading, ''. . . so the arb got on and said, 'Are you guys involved in Textron?' '' The first use of this shortened locution I can find is in a glossary of takeover terminology in Business Week, May 16, 1977. The writer defined arbitrageurs as ''stock-market professionals who buy up huge quantities of a target's shares at prices below the takeover bid.'' (Arbs apparently ''buy up'' rather than merely buy.) This buying is encouraged by the group seeking to take over a company, because it puts large blocks of stock in the hands of short-term speculators; the arbs are usually the natural allies of the takeover crowd."
