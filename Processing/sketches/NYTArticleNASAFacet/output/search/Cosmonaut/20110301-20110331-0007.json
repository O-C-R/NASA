In our new men's fashion issue, Jonathan Mahler profiles the giddy San Francisco Giants pitching phenom Tim Lincecum, while a portfolio of rock stars gives a lesson on enduring cool. Elsewhere in the magazine, we drop in on models who box (seriously), a Soviet cosmonaut who was equal parts boozer and charmer, and a Californian who spent seven years on the shadowy margins in Yemen and the Horn of Africa. And of course there's plenty of straight-up style, too, from head to toe (easy espadrilles). See more from the issue >>"

There was a double-breasted jacket that had turned up everywhere. There were superskinny suits, which hadn't looked so good and so right since the photographer Hedi Slimane defined Dior Homme. There were black watches, white bucks, Breton stripes and goofy brights. We talked trend, and then we talked men. We weren't just after clothes with character; we were looking for character. Stephen Heyman found it in Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut whose life is brilliantly rendered in Jamie Doran and Piers Bizony's ''Starman.'' Jacob Brown brought in Rockstar Charlie -- a downtown boxing hopeful -- and a daring Californian who had had seven years of living dangerously in Yemen and the Horn of Africa. The entire team went mad for a pitcher with balletic form and skater hair. And a real skater -- the legendary Erik Ellington -- agreed to don double-breasted Tom Ford under the canny direction of Magnus Unnar and David Vandewal. Finally, Mikael Jansson and Bill Mullen, over a period of months and endless air miles, put the shrunken suit on the men who have earned the right to publicly flaunt their forms forever. (In addition to that noir watch and easy espadrilles, the real must-have for spring 2011? Iggy Pop's abs regimen. Tape the picture on Page 115 to fridge door now.)"
