For Colonel Chretien, a Breton-born fighter pilot, successful completion of the eight-day flight will mean a place alongside such heroes of French aviation as Louis Bleriot, who in 1909 piloted the first airplane to cross the English Channel. But the culmination of the 21-months he spent at Star City, the Soviet astronauts' training center on the northeast outskirts of Moscow comes at a time of chill in French-Soviet relations, and the political atmosphere has clouded what both nations originally envisioned as a celebration of detente. The schedule calls for the dart-shaped rocket to blast off from the Baikonur space launching center in the desert outside the city of Leninsk in Kazakhstan at 8:29 P.M., Moscow time, placing the Soyuz-T 6 spaceship into orbit 185 miles above the Earth. On Friday, the craft is scheduled to rendezvous and dock with the Salyut 7 orbiting laboratory in which two other Soviet astronauts have been working for six weeks."
