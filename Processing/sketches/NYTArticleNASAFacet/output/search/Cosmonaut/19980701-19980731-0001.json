This time it's a giant asteroid (''It's the size of Texas, Mr. President''), and it's the Chrysler Building that becomes New York's most conspicuously flattened landmark (just as ''Deep Impact'' toppled the Statue of Liberty and ''Godzilla'' wrecked the Brooklyn Bridge.) That damage is done by a fake meteor shower during the first part of ''Armageddon.'' The sight, however apocalyptic, isn't as scary as the prospect of raising a generation of Americans on movies like this. Movie isn't actually the best word to describe ''Armageddon.'' More accurately it's a product, a feat of salesmanship, a sight worth noticing only because, like the asteroid on a collision course with planet Earth, its size and inevitability aren't easy to miss. But it should surprise no one to learn that the catchy title and prime opening date were more vital to the genesis of ''Armageddon'' than the burning need to tell one more derivative disaster story. Or that, without counting technical jargon, official titles, ''government'' or profanity, armageddon is easily the biggest word in the script."
