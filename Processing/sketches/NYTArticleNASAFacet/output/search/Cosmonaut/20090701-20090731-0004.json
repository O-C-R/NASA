Some readers gave details about themselves, which were not independently confirmed. SKABLYAN: The Russian character is founded on contradictions. Inwardly, we understand that in the contemporary world we have not much to be proud of. Therefore, we seek moments of greatness in our history and protect them reverently. The very same can be said of the Soviet Union. The facts show that during the U.S.S.R., the standard of living of the average citizen was, to put it lightly, low. However, paradoxically, the same U.S.S.R. was one of the poles of international politics, and therefore we can't throw out that heritage and call that era a black spot in our nation's history.
