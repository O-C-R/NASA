When my mother-in-law sent me the beautiful Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds catalog in February, it reanimated me, but it befuddled me too. There was an ''olde tyme'' painting of a melon on the cover, while the editor's letter -- ''Let's rock the food supply in 2010!'' it implored -- showed an attractive young family whose father has a thing for overalls and loud shirts. What followed was the cutting edge of heirloom seeds: 1,400 varieties from 70 countries, including vegetables yet to appear in any canvas market bag. Things got more confusing toward the final pages, where ads invited readers to heritage-day and spring-planting festivals at the company's pioneer village in an Ozarks town, Mansfield, Mo., where they could meet seed collectors, historic demonstrators, ''food activists, home-schoolers, western re-enactors . . . gourmet chefs, free-thinkers . . . Ozarkian crafters, trendy vendors & herbal hippies.'' Was this a cult? A bunch of post-ironic steampunkers jumping on the growcavore bandwagon? Or could it actually be earnest, homespun marketing for an heirloom way of life?"
