When Kovalev plays the way he did in the first two games of the Rangers road trip this week, there is only one question to ask: Who are the other candidates for the Hart Trophy as most valuable player in the National Hockey League? Unfortunately, Kovalev does not always play with the strength, skill and determination he showed in scoring two goals and assisting on another over two games on Wednesday and Thursday nights, a 3-1 defeat in Anaheim and a 5-1 victory in Los Angeles. Kovalev and the Rangers played last night in San Jose."
