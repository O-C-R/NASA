But along comes the actor CHRISTIAN CAMARGO, countering that Mr. Ford is not without humor. Do tell. Mr. Camargo, who plays a young officer in Mr. Ford's thriller ''K-19: The Widowmaker,'' said the crew played practical jokes. On the set was a scene-disrupting noisemaker. Looking angry, Mr. Ford grabbed the noisemaker and announced that it was time to do the scene the cast had been rehearsing, Mr. Camargo said. ''Everytime he spoke it was brilliant, you know, brilliant, and then it would be somebody else's line, and you'd hear the noise,'' Mr. Camargo continued. ''He had that gizmo in his hand. It probably cost the producers half a day of money down the drain, but we were on the floor laughing.''"
