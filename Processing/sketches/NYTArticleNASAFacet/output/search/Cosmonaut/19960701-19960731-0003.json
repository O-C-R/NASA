But Yuri Chechi's parents ultimately would look rather prescient for naming their infant son after the celebrated Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. Chechi would never orbit the earth, but like Gagarin, he would become a public figure. And, like Gagarin, he would become one by excelling with his feet well off the ground. Chechi is what is known in gymnastics as a \"ringman,\" and a more appropriate term for the gregarious, red-haired Italian might be \"ringmaster.\" He has won an unprecedented four consecutive world titles in the rings and is a heavy favorite to win the gold medal in Atlanta in the event."
