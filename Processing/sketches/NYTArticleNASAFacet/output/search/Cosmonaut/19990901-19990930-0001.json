This first truly cross-platform, cross-generational, across-the-sexes digital diversion is, some 15 years after its birth, still drawing players to all manner of computers -- from desktops to electronic organizers -- to play it. And 15 years later, people in the gaming industry are still drawn to the creator of Tetris, 44-year-old Alexey Pajitnov. That suits him fine. Making games, playing them and discussing how much fun they are to make and play have been a large part of his life since he was a clever boy growing up in his native Moscow."
