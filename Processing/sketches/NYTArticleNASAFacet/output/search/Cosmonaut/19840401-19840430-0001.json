Rakesh Sharma, a 35-year-old Indian Air Force pilot, joined the two Soviet astronauts for an eight-day visit to the Salyut 7 space station, where three other Soviet astronauts have been living since Feb. 8. The joint flight, the 11th in the ''intercosmos'' series that has taken non- Soviet astronauts into space along with Soviet astronauts, is to include medical experiments in which Mr. Sharma will practice yoga as a possible means of coping with space sickness. The experiments also include detailed space surveys of the Indian subcontinent. But Western experts expect that, like the 10 previous joint flights, this one will probably be less notable for scientific achievement than for claims of new levels of Soviet-Indian relations."
