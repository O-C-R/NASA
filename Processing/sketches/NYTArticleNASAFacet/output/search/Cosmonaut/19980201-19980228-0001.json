Having demonstrated his mastery of the first kind during last year's 128-day crisis marathon aboard the Mir space station, the cosmonaut ALEKSANDR LAZUTKIN demonstrated his skill at the second kind yesterday. Sitting in a cocktail lounge above Times Square, he played down the Mir's many problems, one of which was a pair of backup oxygen canisters that caught fire. Once the flames were out, ''my first reaction was to open the door and let it air out,'' he said. ''Then it sank in, you can't do that, it's not like a fire at home.''"
