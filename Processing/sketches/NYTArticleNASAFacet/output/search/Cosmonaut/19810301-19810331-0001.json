Although Miss Canova is new to Broadway, and Mr. Wass was there only once - in ''Grease'' - the casting is considered a mild sort of coup for Emanuel Azenberg, the producer. Miss Canova and Mr. Wass are television stars. Miss Canova, the daughter of Judy Canova, the radio and movie performer, appeared with Mr. Wass for three years in the television series ''Soap.'' Miss Canova has now gone on to star with Danny Thomas in the series ''I'm a Big Girl Now.'' Mr. Wass, however, is still with ''Soap.''"
