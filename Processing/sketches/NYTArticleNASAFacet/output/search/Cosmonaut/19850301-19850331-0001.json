It said the observatory, the Gamma 1 Project, would help determine the sources of cosmic rays, streams of highly charged particles that bombard Earth from space. ''Researchers expect from the space observatory a detailed picture of the sky in gamma rays,'' Izvestia said in a Saturday article. ''This will make it possible to understand the so- far mysterious nature of gamma stars, their possible relationship with known astrophysical objects.''"
