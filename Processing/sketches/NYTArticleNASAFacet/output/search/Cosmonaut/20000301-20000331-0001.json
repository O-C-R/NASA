The princess part did not materialize, but she and her husband, Ilia Borovski, could be seen as royalty of sorts. Still in their early 20's, they are well known in the world of competitive ballroom dancing, having won dozens of international competitions doing everything from the stately waltz to the flashy Argentine tango. Last year, they moved from Moscow to the United States to broaden their opportunities. Earlier this winter, they became teachers at Royal Ballroom, a studio that opened here this month. Their reputations in Russia had been solid, they said, but here in America, they felt they could soar as far as their fancy footwork could carry them."
