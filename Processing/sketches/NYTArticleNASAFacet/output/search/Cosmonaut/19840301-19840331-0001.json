The Indian astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, 35 years old, will join two Soviet astronauts on the eight-day mission beginning Tuesday, the officials said at a news conference. The Soyuz T-10 spacecraft is to be launched from Soviet Central Asia carrying Mr. Sharma, Col. Yuri V. Malyshev, 42, and Gennadi M. Strekalov, 43. Two days later, it is to dock with the Salyut 7 orbiting space station, where three astronauts have been working since Feb. 8. The Soviet-Indian crew is to return to earth April 10."
