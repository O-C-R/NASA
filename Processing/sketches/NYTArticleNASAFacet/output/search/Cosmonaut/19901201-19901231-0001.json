A public relations firm confirmed that its client, the unnamed company, had signed such a contract and put up \"earnest money\" for an American to accompany a Soviet mission to the Earth-orbiting station. The company had not intended to provide any details until a formal announcement next month, said Guy Brown of Brown, Nelson & Associates, a public relations firm in Houston."
