While the world grieved for the Columbia crew lost on Feb. 1, 2003, three lonely men in space had a somewhat more complicated reaction. They were the members of Expedition Six, two Americans and a Russian installed at the International Space Station. They had been there since the previous November, and they were getting ready to come home. But the Challenger disaster suspended space travel, so no new crew would arrive to relieve them in the foreseeable future. Suddenly they were stuck in a sci-fi limbo."
