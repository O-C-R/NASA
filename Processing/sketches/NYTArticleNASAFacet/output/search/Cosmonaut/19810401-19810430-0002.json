      "lead_paragraph": "ABRAHAM TETENBAUM'S new play, ''Heat of Re-Entry,'' which opened Wednesday night at the Playwrights Horizons' Capital Theater in the Park in Flushing Meadows Park, Queens, is a space-y play about the Soviet space hero Yuri Gagarin and also about Soviet Jews living in our own Brighton Beach. There is undoubtedly a good play about each of them in mind somewhere, but as a package deal, this one just does not get off the launching pad. The story - or stories - is about a Russian immigrant, recently arrived in Brooklyn with Jewish wife and mother-in-law, trying to write a play about the life of Gagarin, from his peasant childhood to heroic first orbit and his death. The writer, hounded by nightmares of his own experiences in Soviet orbit, refuses to leave his apartment, and the play splits, often wildly, from his own story into the one he is writing about. Fine as an idea - and Mr. Tetenbaum has a sense of humor for his comedy - but humor is icing only on this particular cake whose ingredients do not stand up on the plate."

      "lead_paragraph": "If plays were adjudged on topicality alone, \"Heat of Re-entry\" would be a winner. In it, the playwright attempts to explore the life and death of the first cosmonaut. The timing is uncannily right: The play opened at Playwrights Horizons at the Theater-in-the-Park in Queens the night after the space shuttle Columbia's return, and just three nights after the 20the anniversary of man's first space flight. But nearly everything else about \"Heat of Re-entry\" (the title refers to the high temperature of the space capsule during the return to earth) is wrongheaded. Mr. Tetenbaum is writing about a playwright (the fictious Lev Malchikov, a Russian Jewish emigre, living in Brooklyn) who is writing a play about the first man to travel in space (the real Yuri Gargarin). In the play, the playwright comments upon his play in process and converses with this central character, who assumes a life of his own, making demands and intruding upon his creator's domain, playfully, capriciously at first, and then more and more insistently, as the nature of his death is speculated upon. (we have been told that Gagrin dies durong a test flight; the playwright suggests that he invited death by hunting animals from a low-flying jet.) We are led, all too emphatically, into the playwright's struggle to finish his own play, and figure it out: \"I'd say it's turned into a tragedy,\" he concludes. I'd say it never got out of the typewriter. Mr. Tetenbaum types in your basic sitcom style with delusions of tragedy and pretensions toward poetry."
