In the Soviet Union, however, the arrival of a Sixties cinema was complicated by an additional climactic shift known as the Thaw. Roughly coinciding with the reign of Nikita Khrushchev, this was the period of de-Stalinization, the Space Race and the Berlin Wall. On the cultural front, the Thaw inspired the new national idealism exemplified by the poets Yuri Yevtushenko and Andrei Voznesensky, and by the revelatory writings of Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. It also allowed for the revitalization of a moribund film industry that once upon a time, in the silent 1920's, had been the most radical in the world, a resurgence demonstrated by the 25 hugely variegated features, known and unknown, in The Film Society of Lincoln Center series ''Revolution in the Revolution'' at the Walter Reade Theater through Nov. 30."
