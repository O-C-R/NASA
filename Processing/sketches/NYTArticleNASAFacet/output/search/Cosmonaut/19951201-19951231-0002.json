Many of them were as gauzy, slick and elliptical as the best of Madison Avenue. Of all the major parties only the Communists declined to pay for commercial advertising time -- boasting that they are too poor and high minded to indulge in bourgeois campaigning. But, then again, they already had name recognition."

The Bronx-based operation, now in its 22d year, achieves its end by way of Nueva Luz, a photographic journal written in English and Spanish, and by exhibitions in various public spaces. Charles Biasiny-Rivera, Nueva Luz's editor, is himself a photographer, as is Frank Gimpaya, who designed the spare but elegant publication. Exhibitions are organized jointly by Mr. Biasiny-Rivera and his associate editor, Betty Wilde. Their latest is \"Island Journey,\" which graces the spiffy gallery at Hostos Center for the Arts here."
