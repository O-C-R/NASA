THE fictional Island of Crimea - as distinct from the actual Crimean peninsula - and the title place of Vassily Aksyonov's inventive novel, is a sort of Hong Kong, a piece of land saved from the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. It has since developed into an outpost of the West, the shops filled with goods, the air with freedom. But no one is willing to let well enough alone. Especially not the novel's hero, Andrei Arsenievich Luchnikov - ''Looch the basketball star, Looch the racing star; Looch the youth leader of the fifties, jet-set leader of the sixties, political leader of the seventies'' - who dreams of reunion with the Soviet Motherland."
