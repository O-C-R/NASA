Heads huddled on the sleeping porch, at the barber shop, around the kitchen table, they spin tall tales about the panther that chased a woman and her baby in a buckboard, the tornado that swept up Old Man Chandler in his outhouse, the Goat Man who snatches children who try to cross the Swinging Bridge -- wondrous yarns like the ones in THE BOTTOMS (Mysterious Press/Warner, $24.95), a pungent period mystery by Joe R. Lansdale that draws on the idiom of regional folk legend to filter the horror of race violence and serial murder in a small East Texas town during the Depression. The aged narrator, Harry Collins, is lying in a rest home and letting his mind drift back to the events that changed his life in 1933. Picking up the story in his own voice, the 11-year-old Harry shares his innocent wonder at the wild woods, his childish openness to neighbors black and white, and his terror when he and his little sister find the mangled body of a black prostitute in the deep bottom lands along the Sabine River. Harry's father, the town barber and constable, does his best; but when the killer claims a white victim, he can't stop his Klan neighbors from lynching an old black man for the crimes. In this tale of dark enchantment, it falls to Harry to find the truth behind the legend, to look beneath the skin to learn the secret ways of grown-ups -- and to share his bitter lessons with us all."
