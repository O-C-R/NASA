By Seymour Topping The Soviet TU-154 airliner soars over the snowcapped wastelands of Central Asia and settles upon a yellow, grassland plateau. An official car carries us from the small airport past grazing horses, cattle and yaks; beside tiny wooden houses and the conical, tentlike dwellings - wool felt stretched on pine frames - known as yurts; over the Tola River, already glistening with a sheen of ice on this October day, and on into a wide valley. Suddenly, the skyline of a modern city juts above the horizon: High-rise apartment houses in pastel shades, swaying construction cranes, spewing factory smokestacks. We have arrived in Ulan Bator, a city of 400,000 people and the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic. Men and women in traditional long, padded gowns tied with silk sashes share crowded sidewalks with modish young women in smart, Western-style leather jackets and high-heeled boots. A lone Buddhist lama in saffron robes hurries past strolling Russian soldiers on leave from posts on the Chinese frontier."
