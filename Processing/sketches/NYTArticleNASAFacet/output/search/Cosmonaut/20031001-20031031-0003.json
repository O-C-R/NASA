Many also had Gagarin Squares, quite a few had Gagarin Institutes or Gagarin Schools, and many had Gagarin statues. Moscow's was a particular atrocity: a stainless steel Flash Gordon atop a soaring column in the center of a smoggy traffic circle. No Soviet figure, except the deified Lenin, was more exalted in the Soviet firmament than Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. A major part of his allure for the creators of official myths, of course, was that he was not a political figure, and so not subject to retroactive debunking, like every Soviet ruler after Lenin."
