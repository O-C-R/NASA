In the sleeper compartment I found something for the nervous insomniac traveler: a Swedish translation of Lenin's ''Materialism and Empiro-Criticism.'' A Russian basso was singing scenes from ''Boris Godunov,'' piped in through a speaker, and hostesses were serving hot tea from the samovar in the corridor. At the Finnish-Russian border, Russian soldiers searched beneath the carpet on the floor of the sleeper and checked between the pages of my book, but found nothing to interest them. In 1839, the famous French traveler, the Marquis de Custine, wrote about entering Russia: ''The numerous questions I had to meet, and the precautionary forms that it was necessary to pass through, warned me that I was entering the Empire of Fear.'' Custine's travel memoir was frequently republished in the United States during the cold war, presented as a timeless commentary on fearfulness and despotism in Russia."
