They are a new breed of emigre - cosmopolitan, flexible, self-assured, moving with surprising ease from one culture to another, making the traditionally startling leap from Eastern Europe to the West at a time when displacement and dislocation, all too-familiar variants of contemporary life, have become a kind of intensified mobility. Ewa Kuryluk, a slight, dark- haired artist in her late 30's, lives and works in New York. Like many city dwellers, she utilizes objects found on the streets: Discarded wooden boxes serve as frames for some of her drawings on fabric, and chairs picked up here and there become props for her three-dimensional seated figures fashioned out of cloth. A successful artist and writer in Poland by the time she was in her late 20's, Ewa Kuryluk was in this country arranging for an exhibit at a Boston gallery when martial law was declared on Dec. 13, 1981."
