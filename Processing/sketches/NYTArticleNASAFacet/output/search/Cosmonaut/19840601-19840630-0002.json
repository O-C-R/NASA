The answer, says Mr. Hyams, who is currently directing ''2010,'' a sequel to ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' is: with a great deal of anxiety and awe. It was in the spring of 1968 that ''2001,'' Stanley Kubrick's half-satiric, half-reverent vision of the bland and depersonalized future of the human race was thrust at movie audiences accustomed to science-fiction movies containing gigantic bugs, decaying monsters or malevolent aliens. Though Mr. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, the respected science-fiction author, who had co-written the screenplay, had envisioned a cinematic parallel to Homer's ''Odyssey,'' and though critics were divided in their opinions, there was no mistaking the reaction of audiences. Despite its mystical ending and deliberate tedious stretches designed to demonstrate the boredom of space flight, ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' was the fifth most successful box-office attraction in a year dominated by ''The Graduate.'' Since then, it has been reissued twice and earned M-G- M a total of more than $24 million in North American theaters."
