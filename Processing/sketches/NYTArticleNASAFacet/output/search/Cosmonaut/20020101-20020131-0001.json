(If this were 1989, Homer Simpson would tell you to do it with a credit card that doesn't set off that terrible beeping.) With DVD exploding, you may have at least a dozen years. Distributors scrambled all year to supply big new movies and an eclectic stream of older ones. ''Jurassic Park III'' and ''Pearl Harbor'' crowded in with ''Ben-Hur,'' ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' ''Some Like It Hot,'' ''The Godfather DVD Collection,'' ''Citizen Kane,'' ''The French Connection,'' ''The Longest Day'' and ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''"
