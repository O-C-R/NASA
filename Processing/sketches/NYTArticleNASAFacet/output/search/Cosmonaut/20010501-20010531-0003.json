He refers to it as ''the dreaded C word,'' and describes the concept as tainted. ''I just say music,'' he said by telephone from his home in Dublin. '' 'Let's make some music together.' It's easier, and less loaded with meaning. 'Let's make some music, and see if anybody likes it.' ''"

Video can do that for a movie like ''Big Trouble in Little China,'' Mr. Carpenter's 1986 film set in and under the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco. Some Carpenter films -- ''Halloween,'' for example, and ''Escape From New York'' -- earned reputations in theaters. But others in the 80's -- ''The Thing,'' ''Prince of Darkness'' -- built audiences on tape. ''Home video was cooking then,'' he said. Before the cassette, ''Big Trouble,'' available this week in a DVD special edition from Fox, had problems with many critics and the studio. In those days Fox was run by Barry Diller. ''He treated me O.K., but I don't think he liked the movie,'' Mr. Carpenter said. Kurt Russell stars as a trucker who helps Chinese friends rescue a green-eyed woman from a 2,000-year-old demon who needs to marry her to rule the world. There is much kung fu, but of a style found in films of the 60's and 70's. ''An upscale send-up,'' Walter Goodman wrote in The New York Times. ''Gives good value.''"
