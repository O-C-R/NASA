He is now a professor of earth science at Columbia University and Dartmouth College. On Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched a 184-pound ball of machinery 560 miles above the earth. Called Sputnik I, this first artificial satellite circled the planet once every hour and 35 minutes and sent a steady stream of radio beeps back to earth. The impact of Sputnik went far beyond its modest objectives as a scientific instrument. For the Soviet Union, the launching was a tremendous source of pride and propaganda - Soviet superiority in space, Moscow proclaimed, was proof of Soviet superiority on earth. An editorial in Pravda, the newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party, made the point explicitly: ''The launching of the Sputnik is a victory of Soviet man who, with Bolshevist boldness and clearness of purpose, determination and energy knows how to move forward... It has again been proved convincingly and vividly that the Soviet Socialist system is the best form for the organization of workers free of the shackles of exploitation.''"
