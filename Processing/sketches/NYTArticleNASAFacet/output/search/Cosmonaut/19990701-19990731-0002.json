      "lead_paragraph": "We were quite amused and perplexed to see the Science Museum of Long Island referred to as a ''pocket museum'' in the June 20 article, ''Inventing a Science and Technology Museum.'' Over the years, the museum has attracted luminaries such as the Nobel Prize winner Frank Oppenheimer, the astronaut Scott Carpenter, the Russian cosmonaut Viktor Savinhykh, the oceanographer Sylvia Earle, the environmentalist Jim Fowler and the Antarctic specialist Rita Mathews. These and other top scientists have visited the museum and contributed to our courses, workshops and lectures because they felt our hands-on science programs for children were substantive and dynamic. Our director, Dr. John Loret, is a marine biologist who has participated in expeditions with Thor Heyerdahl. Dr. Loret, a former Explorer's Club president, has led more than 35 global science expeditions himself. You don't draw a stellar caliber of people like the ones mentioned to collaborate with or direct an organization when you're merely a ''pocket museum.'' Last year alone, more than 92,000 schoolchildren and adults participated in the museums programs and activities. Our courses run the gamut in variety. In our paleontology program, students actually unearth bones, map them out, then create protective jackets around them just as paleontologists do, or they may build an advanced rocket and launch it in our rocketry program. Others might collect and maintain live specimens from the sea and perform salinity experiments on a boat that goes out in the Long Island Sound. As for our widely popular travel expeditions for adults, CNN filmed our 1998 trip to Easter Island because of the El Nino implications in the Pacific Ocean that we investigated. The program, ''Forging Ahead: Easter Island Expedition,'' aired several times nationally and itnernationally last fall. The History Channel also aired the program this June."
