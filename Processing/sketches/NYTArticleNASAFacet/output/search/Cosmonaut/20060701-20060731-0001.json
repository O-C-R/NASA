    "abstract": "Roger Lowenstein article on debate among economists over immigration, particularly extent to which low-income American workers are being hurt by Mexican immigrants, and whether immigration policy should be changed; on one side is George Borjas of John F Kennedy School of Government, Cuban immigrant, who believes that immigrants hurt economic prospects of Americans they compete with and that policy designed with only Americans' economic prospects in mind would admit far fewer Mexicans, who now account for about 3 in 10 immigrants; most influential of Borjas's critics is David Card, Canadian economist at Berkeley, who argues that immigration is no big deal from economic standpoint and that much of opposition to it is likely social or cultural; photos (L)",

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard while graduate students from Russia, India, China and maybe Mexico mingled in the school cafe, sipping coffee and chattering away in all their tongues, the United States Senate was hotly debating what to do about the country's immigration policy. Borjas professed to be unfazed by the goings-on in Washington. A soft-spoken man, he stressed repeatedly that his concern was not to make policy but to derive the truth. To Borjas, a Cuban immigrant and the pre-eminent scholar in his field, the truth is pretty obvious: immigrants hurt the economic prospects of the Americans they compete with. And now that the biggest contingent of immigrants are poorly educated Mexicans, they hurt poorer Americans, especially African-Americans, the most."
