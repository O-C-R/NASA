Why else would a mountain be named the peak of the devil (la Cime du Diable)? Why lakes of the devil (les Lacs du Diable) or a vale of hell (le Vallon d'Enfer)? In the Middle Ages these were signals to keep away; today, in the Vallee des Merveilles in southeastern France, they beckon to us to come and look. When we do, we find no pools of sulfur or heaps of black slag but a wild, beautiful valley with a clear, swift stream and a carpet of wildflowers in early summer. Then, something else appears: the image of a dagger, scratched on a rock. Near it, the head of an animal with great, twisting horns. Whole slabs of rock are imprinted with dozens of pictures and strange signs. Over 100,000 of these images, dating from the neolithic period and the Bronze Age, have been found on rocks and boulders scattered along this high, remote valley. About 4,000 years ago, Celtic tribes made special journeys here, evidently to practice religious rites. They left a record in the form of rock engravings made over a period of more than 1,000 years. The site is now part of the Mercantour National Park, which can be visited June through October, depending on when the winter snow melts."
