Miss Savitskaya, who is 36 years old, performed welding and soldering operations in the course of her historic excursion in space, which lasted 3 hours and 35 minutes, Tass said. Her walk today upstages a planned space walk in October by an American woman, Kathryn D. Sullivan. Dr. Sullivan and another astronaut, David C. Leetsma, are to venture outside the space shuttle Challenger to demonstrate techniques for orbital refueling. That flight is scheduled for October."
