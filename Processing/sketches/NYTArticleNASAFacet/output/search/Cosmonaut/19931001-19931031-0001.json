As if Russia's problems weren't depressing enough, the country's desperate cash hunger has caused it to turn its vast and impressive military enterprise into a kind of theme park -- with very expensive rides. A new company, MIGS Etc., of Sarasota, Fla., will arrange for tourists to fly, for a price, almost any variety of Russian aircraft, from L-39 training jets to top-of-the-line MIG-29 jet fighters. Customers need not be pilots, let alone fighter pilots; experienced Russian jet jockeys accompany them on all flights. Prices start at $6,000 and go up to $45,000 for a program that involves a simulated dogfight."
