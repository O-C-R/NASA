The rocket range that bills itself as ''the Biggest Cosmodrome in the World'' is a bleak expanse of pitted flatlands, unbearably cold except when it is unbearably hot and impossibly remote. The features that make it a wretched place for humans were all points in its favor when Baikonur was chosen as the main testing facility for Russia's missiles and space rockets. It is possible to fire a test rocket 5,000 miles without landing in China or Turkey or Japan and with little danger of bombarding a major city. The skies are usually clear. The terrain is ideal for retrieving misfires. And there is no one around to snoop."
