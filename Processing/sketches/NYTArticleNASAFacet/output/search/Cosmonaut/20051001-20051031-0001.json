    "lead_paragraph": "LAST fall, a Russian hunter emerged from the forests of southern Sakhalin with a tale of finding English words finger-painted into crumbling cement. Could it be the remains of a long-lost Japanese camp that once held American and British prisoners of war? A search party bounced off in four-wheel drive vehicles. A few days later, they returned, empty handed. Once again, it seemed, Sakhalin's wilderness had won, swallowing up an entire prison camp. Mystery has long shrouded this dagger-shaped island on Russia's eastern edge. Until 1990, all foreigners were banned from Sakhalin, whose existence was briefly, if starkly, highlighted in 1983, when a Soviet jet took off from a base on Sakhalin and inexplicably shot down KAL 007, a South Korean commercial jet filled with passengers. But now that the island's offshore energy riches have attracted the largest foreign investments in Russian history, Sakhalin is open for tourists, and not just for the snowboarders who want to shred Bolshevik Mountain, an island draw for young thrill seekers from around the Pacific Rim."
