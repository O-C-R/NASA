    "lead_paragraph": "''Space Is the Place'' is one of those goofy but enjoyable theme exhibitions that every now and then arrive at regional museums. They are invariably package shows, organized elsewhere and brought in to fill a gap in the exhibition program or because of a connection to the community or the museum itself. Since the Hudson River Museum is home to a popular planetarium, it makes sense that it would host a show on space and space exploration. Then there is the added hook that on July 20 the nation observed the 39th anniversary of the first moon landing, by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin."
