    "lead_paragraph": "LOST IN PLACE: Growing Up Absurd in Suburbia By Mark Salzman. Vintage, $12. A middle-class Connecticut environment may sound like a strange place for Zen and kung fu to flourish, but that's exactly where the author indulged his love for Buddhism, the martial arts and all things Chinese. An absurd childhood in such a setting is rarer than most, ''which is what makes Mark Salzman's memoir . . . so refreshing,'' Blake Morrison said here last year. THE COMPLETE STORIES By Zora Neale Hurston. Harper Perennial, $13. A major figure in the Harlem Renaissance, Zora Neale Hurston was sometimes criticized by her contemporaries for not devoting more of her work to expressing the need for civil rights. But Hurston was more interested in the complexities of character than in voicing purely political concerns. Her interests, which included folklore, feminism, jazz and black cultural history, are reflected in her stories; this book features several that have never before been published. Reviewing an earlier collection for the Book Review in 1985, Brent Staples wrote that her short fiction brings her ''considerable talents into clearer focus.'' The same publisher has also reissued Hurston's 1942 autobiography, DUST TRACKS ON A ROAD ($13), which was republished last year in a new, restored text. Writing of an earlier edition in these pages in 1985, Henry Louis Gates Jr. noted that Hurston's work reveals the tension between the black and white worlds the author simultaneously inhabited. ''Many contemporary critics and writers can turn to her works again and again and be repeatedly startled at her artistry,'' he said. THE TORTILLA CURTAIN By T. Coraghessan Boyle. Penguin, $11.95. The author writes of two California couples -- illegal Mexican immigrants and a tony husband and wife -- whose lives intersect when the rich man hits the poor one with his car. The book ''more than confirms Mr. Boyle's reputation as a novelist of exuberance and invention,'' our reviewer, Scott Spencer, wrote last year. SECRET LIFE: An Autobiography By Michael Ryan. Vintage, $14. When the author was 5 years old, he crossed the threshold of a neighbor's attic and entered an existence from which he only recently escaped. Repeatedly molested, Mr. Ryan became an adult obsessed with sex, using others as he had been used. What this ''artful and lucid'' account ''never fails to do . . . is to disturb as much as it fascinates,'' Daphne Merkin said here in 1995. PETER NEVSKY AND THE TRUE STORY OF THE RUSSIAN MOON LANDING By John Calvin Batchelor. Owl/Holt, $15. This novel is based on the premise that the Soviets really did shoot for the moon first. The narrator, Peter Nevsky, a young cosmonaut candidate whose father was a great World War II aviator and a victim of Stalinism, falls under suspicion himself while he tries to redeem his father's memory. This is the author's ''boldest, most daring novel yet,'' one critic said in 1993. The same publisher has also restored to print Mr. Batchelor's earlier novel AMERICAN FALLS ($15), which takes place during the Civil War. Amaziah Butter, a spy for the North, pursues John Oliphant, a Southern agent whose life resembles his own. The result is ''a novel and complex tale of espionage,'' Roberta Smoodin said in the Book Review in 1985. RIVER OUT OF EDEN: A Darwinian View of Life By Richard Dawkins. Basic Books, $10. The author is among the scientists who believe that natural selection is still the best explanation for why organisms are the way they are. He is ''a masterly expositor, a writer who understands the issues so clearly that he forces his readers to understand them too,'' David Papineau wrote in these pages last year. The same publisher has reissued THE ORIGIN OF HUMANKIND, by Richard Leakey ($10), which details the first discovery of protohumans and the continuing struggle to explain their development. In 1995 our reviewer, Richard Stone, said, ''Mr. Leakey's readers are left to create their own dramas of discovery and revelation from the well-presented . . . facts.'' The father of the entire debate is profiled in CHARLES DARWIN: Voyaging, by Janet Browne (Princeton University, $18.95). The author tackles Darwin's own evolution, analyzing his character as much as his theories. In this first volume of a planned two-part biography, she ''has given us what promises to be a wonderful and well-rounded portrait,'' one critic wrote last year. ''This Darwin is remarkably real.'' ALMOST INNOCENT By Sheila Bosworth. Louisiana State University, $11.95. A young girl tells the story of her parents, a wildly mismatched couple who met in the Louisiana of the 1950's and whose love endured but inevitably changed. This first novel, now restored to print, reveals ''very real gifts,'' D. G. Myers said here in 1984. MEMNOCH THE DEVIL: The Vampire Chronicles By Anne Rice. Ballantine, $14. This latest novel in the author's series about the blood- sucking Lestat brings him into the company of Satan himself, who presents his own moral argument for rejecting God's plan. ''Ms. Rice's ambition is commendable,'' Wendy Smith wrote in these pages last year. ''She has earned her legions of fans by seldom repeating herself.'' Laurel Graeber"
