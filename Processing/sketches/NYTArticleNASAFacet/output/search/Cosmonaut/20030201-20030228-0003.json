Kostelnik, NASA's deputy associate administrator for the space shuttle program, as recorded by The New York Times. Fuller excerpts are online at nytimes.com/columbia. Q. General, have you found the debris in Arizona, California and New Mexico? Any of those reports tiles? A. It's not clear what the material is. I think we have had some e-mail correspondence that potentially looks like it could be either that or potentially wing material. If it is wing material, obviously that would be very important to the investigations. So without speculating precisely what it is, the sources were credible enough to cause us to send a NASA team out to take a look. And I'm sure that what they find will be reported as soon as it's made available."

One can hardly think bigger than they do in this program, the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project, which admits that star exploration will never be accomplished without moving entirely beyond the physics of rocket propulsion. With its musings on worm holes and warp drives -- potential ways and means to the stars -- the program is a small brainstorm within the vast regimentation of NASA, a sort of bloop in the bureaucratic water cooler. Alas, on Saturday afternoon, my visit to the project's Web page informed me that its financing has been uncertain for months."
