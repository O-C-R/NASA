    "lead_paragraph": "This is a story about wealth and space and America and Russia, and it begins with one man, Walter Anderson -- a man with white hair and pale skin, square, gold-rimmed glasses and a physical presence so profoundly unprepossessing it's almost impossible to remember what he looks like. Anderson is 46 and worth almost a billion dollars. He lives in Washington -- the city he grew up in, a city he hates; his hatred of the government is, as he puts it, ''personal'' -- in an apartment adorned with a painting he commissioned based on a Smashing Pumpkins lyric, ''I am still just a rat in a cage.'' ''That's what we are,'' Anderson explains, ''rats in a cage. And we're going to gnaw through the bars because we've got about a 30-year window here, and we'll starve if we don't get out.'' The cage Anderson refers to is the planet earth itself, and he has taken it upon himself to ensure we get off. In 1989, Anderson gave $80,000 to finance the International Space University; in 1991, $100,000 to found the Space Frontier Foundation; in 1994, $5 million to start the Foundation for the International Nongovernmental Development of Space; and between 1996 and 1999, $40 million to build the Roton, a manned, reusable spaceship. Then a few months ago, in one of his eriodic calls to me, he rang me up: ''I'm in Russia!'' Anderson was midway through three days of talks with Yuri Semyonov, president of the private Russian space corporation Energia, and in a move that would later marginalize NASA from the Anderson-Russia-America love triangle, he was arranging for a new company, called MirCorp, to lease the space station Mir. It was not an act of open defiance. In most ways it was an act of trust, devotion and faith. Anderson had been dreaming of leaving Earth since he was a little boy. He wired the Russians $7 million before he even signed Mir's lease. Anderson put up $31 million toward the lease, which will eventually cost $200 million a year. It will give MirCorp the rights to Mir for the remainder of its lifetime, the use of two or three manned Soyuz rockets annually, as well as two or three unmanned Progress rockets, the exclusive control over Mir's visitors and technologies, 40 days of active operation and the privilege of fixing Mir up. All of this has put Anderson more cozily into bed financially with Energia, thereby creating a situation highly threatening to NASA. The American space agency, after all, was already embroiled with the Russians in the way-over-schedule, way-over-budget, politically Pollyanna-ish International Space Station, a project that was announced 17 years ago under President Ronald Reagan, that had already incurred several Congressional hearings and that space patriots in Washington were determined to make ''the only space in space.'' Specifically, at the time Anderson leased Mir, NASA was blaming the Russians for being two years behind in launching the service module, or living quarters, for the International Space Station. (It was finally launched on July 11.) Worse, rumor had it among space experts that NASA could not technically complete the International Space Station without Russian help. And many inside the agency feared that the Russians would lose interest in the International Space Station altogether if they kept their own space station up."
