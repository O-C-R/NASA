It is, nevertheless, a task for which Robert Koenig is well suited, not least because of his experience as director of the Montclair Art Museum and, more recently, at the Noyes Museum. So it is no surprise to find out that as guest curator of \"More Than Meets the Eye,\" at the Morris Museum here, Mr. Koenig has produced with dispatch and not a little flair a show that includes most of the stars in the New Jersey art firmament between 1900 and 1994. That all of them are figurative artists may reflect the curator's contention that, notwithstanding such departures as Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism, Realism has been the \"pervasive and persistent trait in American art.\""
