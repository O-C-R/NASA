''Smoke in the cabin was what we thought we were dealing with originally,'' said Michael T. Suffredini, the head of the station program, in a morning news briefing in Houston. The nature of the problem proved to be more slippery, but the astronauts -- Pavel V. Vinogradov of Russia, Col. Jeffrey N. Williams of the Army and Thomas Reiter of Germany -- ''did a great job'' of reacting quickly, Mr. Suffredini said."
