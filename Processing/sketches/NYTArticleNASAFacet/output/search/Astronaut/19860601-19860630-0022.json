Such sightings would indicate the proximity of a giant, the descendant of a creature that 50 million years ago, for reasons unknown, abandoned the confinement of the land for the boundlessness of the oceans. In fact, despite its presence in lore, literature, metaphor and familiar waters, remarkably little is known about the history and habits of the whale. ''Our knowledge of whales is about equivalent to what we knew about primates 40 years ago,'' said Mr. Sadove, research director of the Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation, based in Hampton Bays."

Mr. Borman, 58 years old, said in a statement that after the merger he and his wife, Susan, would move to Las Cruces, N.M., a town about 40 miles north of El Paso, Tex. He told a news conference in Miami that he would work with their son Fred."

His resignation was the latest in a string of high-level personnel shakeups in recent weeks at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its booster rocket contractor. Management Overhaul Likely Nearly all of the engineers and managers who had key roles in the decision to launch the Challenger have now been shifted to other jobs or have retired. The Challenger was destroyed and its crew of seven were killed when a booster rocket failed shortly after the launching Jan. 28."

They go to outer space. It's all part of a mix-up. Jinx, the appropriately named camp mascot, a literal-minded computer (which, admittedly, hasn't had all its little kinks worked out) overhears a camper idly wishing to be in orbit and arranges to launch him, along with the four other members of his flight team and their astronaut counselor. The situation makes for drama, adventure and lots of questions. Will they make it back? Will they be able to transform themselves from a group of bickering teen-agers to a disciplined crew? Are they capable of making hard adult decisions? And how is NASA ever going to explain all this to their parents?"

      "lead_paragraph": "The chairman of the President's commission on the space shuttle and the only Nobel laureate on the panel were at odds from the beginning. But now, after four months of investigating the Challenger disaster, the 13-member commission has reached a remarkable consensus, helped in part by the enormous, steadying influence of the first man to walk on the moon and by a two-star Air Force general. The full story behind the work of the commission, whose report is to be issued Monday, will not be known until all transcripts of secret meetings are made public and the participants have provided full accounts. But interviews conducted in recent days with most of the commissioners shed new light on the individuals and influences that shaped the commission's work. The panel's conduct of the investigation is being hailed by many observers and by most of the commission members. But some commissioners quarreled over whether the final draft was tough enough on the space agency, so it is not unreasonable to suppose there will be criticism from some quarters on this issue."

In addition, Mr. Levine, a former investment banker who was accused of insider trading while at several firms, agreed to cooperate with a widening inquiry into the pervasive but ambiguously defined Wall Street practice of leaking information. Mr. Levine, who traded through the Bahamian subsidiary of a Swiss bank, was accused of using such information to trade in the stocks of companies involved in takeovers. Three other young Wall Streeters, and one of their customers, also pleaded guilty to Federal charges in a separate insider trading case. A fifth man, accused of stealing some of the information that was purportedly used in the trades, pleaded not guilty."

All the while, in its effort to keep the space shuttle cost-effective, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration systematically dismantled the safety and quality control apparatus that were its hallmark throughout the Apollo moon missions, the commission concluded. In part NASA tripped over its own ''can-do'' attitude, the 13 commissioners decided, an attitude of near-infallibility that emboldened the agency to achieve great feats of exploration but poorly prepared it for ''the planning and scheduling discipline required to operate as a 'space truck.' '' Those discoveries, commission members say, suggest that a fatal accident was almost inevitable - and that fixing the space shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets may prove among the easier tasks as NASA struggles to rebuild its shuttle program. In the course of an intensive but time-constrained 120-day investigation, the Presidential panel uncovered problem after problem, involving both humans and equipment, that seem to defy what one investigator called ''the quick and dirty fix.''"

There was grief and sadness for the loss of seven brave members of the crew; firm national resolve that those men and women be forever enshrined in the annals of American heroes and a determination, based on that resolve and in their memory, to strengthen the space shuttle program so that this tragic event will become a milestone on the way to achieving the full potential that space offers to mankind. The President, who was moved and troubled by this accident in a very personal way, appointed an independent commission made up of persons not connected with the mission to investigate it. The mandate of the commission was to: 1. Review the circumstances surrounding the accident to establish the probable cause or causes of the accident and 2. Develop recommendations for corrective or other action based upon the commission's findings and determinations."

The tapes, which were thought to be damaged beyond repair after nearly six weeks' exposure to salt water, are now undergoing a special treatment to reverse the damage. If the process is successful, it could reveal any conversations among the astronauts just before the disaster that destroyed the Challenger and killed its seven-member crew shortly after its launching at Cape Canavaral, Fla., on Jan. 28. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration cautioned in interviews that there were no indications that any such conversations took place in the Challenger's 74-second flight. They added, however, that the new technique would soon let them know for sure."

The decision, a new setback for the shuttle project, threatened further postponements in the nation's stalled program of planetary exploration. Future planetary missions and some large, classified Defense Department satellites will probably be reassigned to launchings by unmanned rockets, officials said. The missions immediately affected are the Galileo spacecraft to explore Jupiter and the European Space Agency's Ulysses spacecraft to orbit and study the Sun. Until the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger last January, they were to have been deployed from shuttles last month and then boosted into interplanetary space by powerful Centaur rockets."

Pulling a chair up to the kitchen table in his spacious Manhattan loft the other day, Mr. Rosenquist excitedly described the work. ''It will be filled with signs and symbols like a kiss mark, a skull and bones, and two people with a thunderbolt between them,'' the artist said, sketching the work on a legal pad. ''It will have ladies of the world - Chinese, African and Caucasian ladies. There will be two parrots and a dog, along with calligraphies in French, Russian, Telugu, Tamil, Indian, Hebrew and Persian. In a two-dimensional surface, I'm trying to show the noise of humanity. ''The parrots and the dog are animals that look like they are attempting to speak,'' he added. ''Man is an animal in a state of evolution, trying to communicate further, and this mural is going into an environment of machines that are trying to help us communicate.''"
