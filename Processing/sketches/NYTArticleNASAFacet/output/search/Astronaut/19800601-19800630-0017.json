The Seminoles stayed away from it because tough podzol and palmetto scrub were of no use to them. The surf fishing there was probably wonderful long ago, but only an eccentric would bother to hike across a shadeless hot plate tormented by Nimrod mosquitoes when every easy waterway in Florida brimmed with fish. There have never been caverns or significant metal or mineral deposits. In other words, since Paleozoic times, this land was destined to host either a bird sanctuary or some sort of military establishment. That it also happened to become the site of our first total departure from the planet is perhaps what the Seminoles always knew it deserved. The years since America's moon walk have not been altogether happy at Cape Canaveral. Huge rocket casings and launch fixtures of the Apollo years lie abandoned among Sabal palms and saw grass. Birds live in them. There is a touch of Flushing Meadow or Angkor Wat here, the sadness of futures passed. And now there is the worst insult of all at what was supposed to be man's embarcadero to the stars - a $9 billion spaceship that refuses to fly."

Cars cram the lot in back of the complex of buildings, and they are nose-to-tail along West State Street in front. It's enough to make a parker suspect a relationship between fat bureaucracy, thin cities and, once inside the museum, the use of art as a social palliative. The last-named is, essentially, the theme of all three exhibitions now running at the museum. One of them, ''New Deal Art: New Jersey,'' celebrates, through July 20, the last great era of Government patronage. Another, ''Visual Arts Fellowship Recipients 1978 to 1980,'' on view through July 13, presents works by local artists to whom the State Council on the Arts, in conjunction with the National Endowment for the Arts, has awarded grants of up to $3,000. (That sum, incidentally, is about equal to the roughly $25 a week earned by those working on the art projects of the Works Progress Administration during the Depression.)"
