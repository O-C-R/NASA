Mr. Wiese, at 45 the club's youngest president, stands in the wood-paneled study of the international society's headquarters on East 70th Street. ''Trust me,'' he says solemnly.

A panel of experts assembled by the National Academy of Sciences concluded last week that there was only a remote chance a robotic mission could be mounted quickly enough to succeed and some danger that it might damage the instrument. Instead, the panel said that NASA should send astronauts up on a shuttle flight to service and rescue this incredibly valuable telescope before its gyroscopes and batteries begin to fail a few years from now. The academy's unusually blunt assessment and a similar judgment by the Aerospace Corporation provide the strongest evidence yet that NASA ought to reconsider its previous opposition to a shuttle rescue flight. The paramount goal ought to be preserving the Hubble by any means necessary, even if that requires diverting the shuttle from other tasks and slowing the president's grandiose plans to send astronauts to the Moon and Mars in future years. If the space agency balks, Congress will need to insist that NASA make the Hubble its highest near-term priority and use the shuttle if necessary."

      "lead_paragraph": "Clint Eastwood's ''Million Dollar Baby'' is the best movie released by a major Hollywood studio this year, and not because it is the grandest, the most ambitious or even the most original. On the contrary: it is a quiet, intimately scaled three-person drama directed in a patient, easygoing style, without any of the displays of allusive cleverness or formal gimmickry that so often masquerade as important filmmaking these days. At first glance the story, about a grizzled boxing trainer whose hard heart is melted by a spunky young fighter, seems about as fresh as a well-worn gym shoe. This is a Warner Brothers release, and if it were not in color (and if the young fighter in question were not female), ''Million Dollar Baby,'' with its open-hearted mixture of sentiment and grit, might almost be mistaken for a picture from the studio's 1934 lineup that was somehow mislaid for 70 years."

A1 Political and spiritual world leaders urged support for victims of the tsunamis as relief agencies and governments girded to offer technical help and aid. The United States said assistance was already on its way to some of the most stricken areas. The speed and scale of the disaster left some relief specialists struggling to keep pace with events. A10 The violent earthquake that struck northwest of Sumatra, Indonesia, was a perfect wave-making machine, and the lack of a tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean essentially guaranteed the devastation that swept coastal communities around southern Asia. A10 Ukraine Opposition Gaining Viktor A. Yushchenko, the opposition leader, appeared headed for a strong victory in Ukraine's bitter presidential race, based on early vote counts and surveys of voters at the polls. A1 Mr. Yushchenko has recovered enough from poisoning with the chemical dioxin that he should be able to serve as Ukraine's president, but he will continue to need treatment for months if not years. It is difficult to predict with great certainty the course of his recovery, and most of the treatment he will need is somewhat experimental. A12 Astronauts Get Vital Supplies An American and a Russian astronaut got some vital supplies when an unmanned cargo ship docked at the international space station, ending a shortage that had alarmed officials at home and forced the two men to ration supplies. The cargo included Christmas and New Year's gifts for the crew from relatives and friends, and turkey for a belated Christmas dinner. A12 Video of Mosul Attack Surfaces The militant group Ansar al-Sunna posted a video on the Internet claiming to show the explosion at a military mess tent in Mosul. The group, which earlier took credit for the attack, said its suicide bomber had spent a long time observing the camp and had slipped inside during a change of the guards. The authenticity of the video could not be determined. A8 It has been less than a week since the bombing in Mosul that killed 22 people. It was the worst single attack on American soldiers since the transfer of sovereignty in June, and the forces at the base there are defensive, grieving and on edge, but determined to carry on. A8 Jewish Settlement Withdrawal Peat Sadeh, a small Jewish settlement in the southwest of the Gaza Strip has become the first in which all the residents have agreed to leave under the Israeli government's Gaza withdrawal plan. The collective decision is significant because Jewish settlers in Gaza have sought to present a united front against the plan to uproot them. A4 NATIONAL A12-15 Airlines Look Ahead To Deeper Cuts in 2005 Passengers who got caught up in the airlines' troubles this weekend got a glimpse of what might await them in the coming year.

But the signs of labor unrest that cropped up could be a harbinger of things to come in an industry already buffeted by bankruptcies and structural change. A1 Many Treatments, Small Gains Desperate parents of autistic children have tried almost everything -- hormone injections, exotic diets, faith healing -- in the hope of a cure.

A1 Suing for a Silent Night Each year Chris Birkett turns his modest Scottsdale, Ariz., house and yard into a 150,000-light ''Winter Wonderland,'' complete with artificial snow, Disney music and narration. The couple next door wish he would just shut up. They filed malicious noise-making charges that now threaten Mr. Birkett with $2,500 in fines and six months in jail. A13 Doctors Try Labor Tactics Doctors around the country are increasingly using methods popularized by labor unions to gain leverage in their fight against rising premiums for malpractice coverage. Over the past few years, their tactics have included large-scale marches, limiting treatment to emergencies or suspending service altogether. The doctors have not always been successful in gaining insurance changes, but experts say the pressure has helped move the issue up on the political agenda. A13 Last Mass for Boston Parish A protest vigil at a parish scheduled to be closed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ended when the police sealed off the 114-year-old church after its final Mass and ordered parishioners to leave. The closing is part of a reorganization developed to address declining attendance, a shortage of priests and financial pressure caused in part by the priest sexual abuse scandal. A13 NEW YORK/REGION B1-5 Low-Cost Housing Plans For Brooklyn Waterfront City officials are planning to let developers put up larger buildings along the neglected north Brooklyn waterfront in return for setting aside up to a quarter of the apartments as low-cost units in order to address a shortage of housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers.

This time, he will compete for an additional $2 million against the two survivors of a competition among nearly 150 past five-time winners. In a statement issued with the announcement of what the producers called a ''super tournament,'' Alex Trebek, the host of the quiz show, said: ''Ever since Ken started his amazing run, people have been speculating on how some of the past 'Jeopardy!' players would do against him. We're answering that question.'' The televised matches are to begin in February or March, and the finals will be seen in May. The runner-up will receive $500,000; the third-place finisher, $250,000. 'Wonderful Town' Closing The revival of ''Wonderful Town'' at the Al Hirschfeld Theater, currently starring Brooke Shields, is to close after the Jan. 30 performance. By then, the show, with music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and book by Jerome Chodorov, based on stories by Ruth McKenna, will have played 16 previews and 507 regular performances. Opening night was Nov. 23, 2003. Shortage of Dwarfs A four-dwarf version of ''Snow White'' prompted protests from grumpy Christmas theatergoers in Stendal, Germany, who preferred the traditional complement of seven. Citing an article in the newspaper Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, Reuters reported that the Altmark Stendal theater told the audience, from nearby Hanover, that it could afford only six actors for the show but tried to make theatergoers happy by attaching two puppets costumed as dwarfs to a background wall. The actor cast as the prince was supposed to double as the seventh dwarf but made only a brief appearance onstage. Susanne Kreuzer, a spokeswoman for the theater, told the newspaper, ''The seventh dwarf wasn't onstage the whole time because he was stuck down in the mine, working overtime.'' Coming Attraction The United States premiere of ''Downfall'' (''Der Untergang''), the German film that stirred debate over its sympathetic depiction of Hitler (played by Bruno Ganz, below) in the 12 days leading to his suicide in his bunker in Berlin, will be presented in mid-February at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village. When the $16 million ''Downfall'' opened in Germany in September, more than 100,000 people went to see it on the first day. ''The whole debate over whether we are allowed to show Hitler as a human being is wrong,'' said Bernd Eichinger, the film's writer and producer. ''Of course he was a human being. You have to make clear to people that he was a human being, and that's the dangerous thing.'' Footnotes The jazz vocalist Shirley Horn opens an engagement tonight at Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan. Through Jan. 9, she will perform at 8 p.m. on Thursdays and Sundays and at 8 and 10:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The birthday of Victor Herbert (Feb. 1, 1859) will be celebrated by the Collegiate Chorale Singers, led by Robert Bass (celebrating his 25th anniversary as the music director), with an evening of American operetta on Feb. 1 at Alice Tully Hall. Besides the music of Herbert, the program, conceived and written by Mr. Bass and Roger Rees and featuring the Jupiter Symphony Chamber Players, will include music by two other European composers who became American citizens: Sigmund Romberg and Rudolf Friml. After the release of their album ''Astronaut'' (Epic Records), Duran Duran will begin a North American tour of at least 40 dates with a performance at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan on Feb. 8. The tour ends on April 13 at Madison Square Garden."
