      "lead_paragraph": "SANTA FE, N.M. -- Vivaldi would surely find it frustrating, if not a little strange, that his achievement as a composer today is distorted by the cultlike popularity of ''The Four Seasons.'' He was indeed a master of Baroque instrumental music. Still, from his early days he was powerfully drawn to the theater and to the voice. He wrote nearly 50 operas. Yet productions are rare. The mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli brought overdue attention to Vivaldi's operas with a successful album of arias in 1999 and a subsequent concert tour. Now the Santa Fe Opera is presenting what it is being billed as the first major American production of Vivaldi's ''Griselda,'' a remarkable work first performed in Venice in 1735. It opened here last month. The director is Peter Sellars, whose 1981 staging of Handel's ''Orlando'' at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., set at Cape Canaveral with the knight Orlando portrayed as an astronaut, brought Mr. Sellars and that Handel masterpiece to widespread attention."
