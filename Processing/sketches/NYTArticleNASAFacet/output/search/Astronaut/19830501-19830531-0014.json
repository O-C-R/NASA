The few scholars who have investigated this modest emigration to Penn's Holy Experiment cannot agree whether the Krefelders were Mennonites or Quakers. While the Krefelders spoke German, some of their names - such as op den Graeff - are evidently Dutch, and Penn himself referred to them as Hollanders. Until 1983, the Krefeld pilgrims and the Concord, the ship that carried them from Gravesend in England to what is now Philadelphia in 1683, were decidedly obscure."

At their simplest, these exertions are intended to convince voters that the oldest Democratic Presidential candidate is also the ''most vigorous.'' But the 68-year-old Californian also has a deeper purpose. He is determined, by brute persistence in the face of doubt, to make the Democratic Party take his candidacy seriously."

The small jets were commanded by radio signal to fire over a period of 1 hour 22 minutes, leaving the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite in a lopsided orbit 14,222 to 21,962 miles high."

It was pure sophomoric humor, but even blase seniors were amused, and probably a few of the younger teachers, too. It helped downtrodden youth build solidarity against the ruling elders."

The pouches under Mr. Mondale's eyes sometimes turn dark and puffy with fatigue. His normally ruddy face takes on a faint gray pallor, and even his hair, cropped close and grooved into place, looks spiky and listless. ''I get tired once in a while, no question about it,'' Mr. Mondale said in an interview at the end of a particularly grinding week. ''I've been going 16 hours a day for a long time. Every once in a while I droop. But I've been doing reasonably well, and the bottom line is very encouraging, very encouraging.''"

Hess, the president of Brooklyn College, looked out at the borough - and the bridge - of his heart from a 60th-floor soiree in Manhattan. William R. Everdell, a Brooklyn historian, decided to celebrate by sending out for pizza. Much of Brooklyn, Manhattan and the waters between resounded to music and laughter as well as fireworks last night, as untold thousands of parties were held to celebrate the Brooklyn Bridge Centennial. The partygoers gathered mainly to watch the fireworks and the sound-and-light show - but also to celebrate a pleasant turning point. As Mr. Everdell, co-chairman of the history department at St. Ann's, a private school in Brooklyn, put it before breaking out champagne for his 15 guests, ''After all, ths only happens once every hundred years.''"

And with the economic summit meeting coming up this weekend in Williamsburg, Va., the Reagan Administration is hustling to brief opinion moulders arriving by the hundreds from around the world. Yesterday, President Reagan canceled his regular appointment schedule to confer with his staff on how best to handle all the briefing and backgrounding. The White House was said to feel that, so far, too much of the advance reporting on the meeting concerned such things as logistics, the kind of food to be eaten and the planned pageantry in the restored colonial village. Meanwhile, the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company announced that 400 of its employees, working since January at Williamsburg, had installed 5,000 telephones, 68 telex machines, 25 miles of cable and communications equipment to deal with ''hostage situations, bomb threats and other acts of terrorism.''"

It is a tribute to Hideko Takamine (for more than 50 years the most popular actress in Japan) and to her husband, the writerdirector, Zenzo Matsuyama. Miss Takamine and Mr. Matsuyama came to New York to take part in the festivities, and anyone who expected them to be serious souls, sagging under the weight of their honors, was in for a surprise. They are the most lighthearted of icons, and through the interpreting skills of Peter Grilli (director of the Japan Film Center), the gist of their jest is almost always clear. Miss Takamine claims to be 60 years old, although she could pass for 40, and she is delicate in every particular (on one narrow wrist, she wears what must be the narrowest gold watch in the world). Mr. Matsuyama has white hair, and Miss Takamine says the white hair has come since she retired from the screen in 1979. ''All this time, I've been supporting him,'' she says. ''Now it's his turn, and it's a terrible responsibility.''"

Gravity will be lost. What will happen to the them biologically and to their sophisticated social structure, no one knows - which is why they are being sent into space. Tucked into the cargo bay of the space shuttle Challenger, among the communications satellites of Canada and Indonesia, the classified experiments of the Air Force and the cosmic radiation experiments of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, will be the 150 carpenter ants from Camden. Ants in space is the idea of Camden high school students, and their experiment has been deemed important enough by NASA to qualify for its Small Self-Contained Payloads Program, open to those with scientific research projects and the $3,000 to $10,000 fare."
