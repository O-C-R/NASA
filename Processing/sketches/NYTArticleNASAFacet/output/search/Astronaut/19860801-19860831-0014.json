But officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration complained at a press briefing that they had been taking a ''very bum rap'' in news reports and editorials that have suggested the agency was deliberately concealing information about the last moments of the seven astronauts, who died when the space shuttle broke up shortly after launching Jan. 28. The officials said that in sensitive matters involving how the crew died, they have consistently tried not to discuss isolated pieces of evidence. The agency said in a statement today that all important evidence was communicated first to the families of the dead crew members, and then, once the investigation of the cause of death was complete, to the public."

The article in The New York Times referred to by the chairman was published Feb. 9 and reported that internal space agency memorandums had warned that flaws in the booster rocket seals could cause a catastrophic accident. WILLIAM P. ROGERS, chairman of the commission: I think it goes without saying that the article in The New York Times and other articles have created an unpleasant, unfortunate situation. There is no point in dwelling on the past. The important thing is to be sure that the commission has all the appropriate documents and all the appropriate information. It may well be that we have all learned a lesson from this, that as much as possible we would hope that NASA and NASA's officials will volunteer any information in a frank and forthright manner. We don't want to be in a position that we have to ask for everything in advance."

Ocassionally, it hits a grand slam. Mostly, however, television is just there, whiling away the hours. The medium devours new material; its appetite is insatiable, and it is no good saying that television should be better than it is. Television already is what it is, and there is not, and never will be, enough good new material to go around. The Emmy nominations, recently announced, went to those programs you expected them to go to: 16 for ABC's ''Moonlighting'' at the top of the list, with NBC's ''The Cosby Show'' and ''The Golden Girls'' each getting 15. At the same time, for ABC to find a ''Moonlighting,'' it had to commission and then reject numerous other programs. These programs, usually not shown, are the equivalent of a magazine's slush pile. On ABC tonight, the slush pile comes to life."

[ Page A1, Column 3. ] Chile's leader rejected proposals of a high-level Reagan Administration envoy for substantial improvements in Chile's human rights record and the start of a political transition to democracy, Administration officials said. As a result, the officials said, the United States is weighing economic steps against Chile and is seeking to increase pressure on Gen. Augusto Pinochet out of concern that the absence of political change is leading to widening terrorist activity. [ A1:1. ]"

Col. Ellison S. Onizuka, the Challenger astronaut. Lieutenant Colonel Onizuka, who died with his six fellow crew members in the shuttle explosion Jan. 28, was the first Asian-American astronaut and is regarded as a hero by Japanese-Americans. His photograph hangs in the shops and offices of dozens of his friends in this neighborhood, which is bordered by Los Angeles, Alameda, First and Third streets in the southeast corner of the downtown section. The dispute pits most Little Tokyo businessmen and community leaders, who favor the name change, against a handful of merchants on Weller Street, which is a block long and is lined by fashionable stores and restaurants that cater to Japanese tourists."

Since then, ice-cream parlors have experienced boom and bust, but the species endures. Snuggling up with a pint in front of the video-cassette recorder has its pleasures, but many people prefer to sip their sodas in public, on a stool, with the ineffable smell of chocolate and happiness. Naturally, the species has had to adapt. It sells sandwiches. It accepts heresies such as mashed-up cookies. It even goes in for aberrations, including a concoction called Astronaut (freeze-dried ice-cream crystals). But in essence the ice-cream parlor remains what it always was, a monument to decadence, languor and the insatiable American sweet tooth."

The launching of the satellite aboard an Atlas-E booster, which had been scheduled for last Friday at Vandenberg Air Force Base, 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles, has been reset for Sept. 7, according to Jim Elliott, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The space agency is responsible for placing the satellite into orbit for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."

Thomas Van Arsdale, the new head of the New York City Central Labor Council, decided not to ask union members to show the flag ''on a holiday they could spend at the beach.'' But if the trade unionists are not marching tomorrow, nearly everyone else in town continues to do so on one day or another. The green stripe on Fifth Avenue for the St. Patrick's Day parade, which dates back to colonial times but has had its format as an Irish Catholic New York institution since the 1850's, now is privately sponsored, no longer a municipal perk. There is not sufficient chromatic spectrum in city paint buckets to accommodate each of the ethnics that have been on the march since then. The West Indians and the Norse, in Brooklyn, do it. The Puerto Ricans and the Irish, of course, do it. The homosexuals and celebrants of Halloween (in Greenwich Village) do it. The Greeks, the Irish and the Jews; the military, those with pacifist views - all do it."
