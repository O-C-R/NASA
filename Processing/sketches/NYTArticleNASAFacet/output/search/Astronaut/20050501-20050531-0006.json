In rapid succession the academy's operating arm, the National Research Council, has criticized some pet projects and policies of powerful federal agencies and even the White House. That is a welcome onslaught of truth-telling at a time when rabid partisans routinely shade the facts for political gain. The academy, which is based in Washington, operates a vast array of advisory committees that provide advice to the federal government and other sponsors who contract for its services. Typically, Congress or a federal agency might ask the academy to review the evidence and render a verdict on some important technical issue -- everything from improving the census to protecting the environment from genetically engineered animals. The academy will then round up experts to produce a report that is supposed to be the definitive word on the subject."

Much as he longed to belong to a fraternity filled with campus leaders and star athletes, he was not sure acquiescing was the right thing to do or that he was acting in the best of motives.

For 10 months of the year, heavily muscled American-made cars hit the track nearly every Sunday and circulate for several hours at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. About 75 million fans care deeply about the outcome. They turn out in crowds that make the Super Bowl look like a high school game, cramming speedways in places like Darlington, N.C., and Martinsville, Va., obscure to most Americans but sacred ground to the passionate followers of Nascar, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. Jeff MacGregor, a writer for Sports Illustrated, decided to find out what the fuss and the furor are all about. He bought a motor home, sweet-talked his wife into joining him and set out on an all-American odyssey, attending nearly 100 races in 35 states and clocking 47,649 miles on the odometer during the 2001 Nascar season. ''Sunday Money,'' the drivers' term for prize money, is his overstuffed log book, a wild, often hilarious take on the sights, sound and smells of a multibillion-dollar sport that some political commentators now see as the key to understanding mainstream America."
