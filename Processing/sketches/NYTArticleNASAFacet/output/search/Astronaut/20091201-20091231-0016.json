      "lead_paragraph": "FILM SERIES 'CITY LIGHTS' AND 'MODERN TIMES' (Monday through Wednesday) This series features Charlie Chaplin's last two films without spoken dialogue (with their elaborate scores and sound effects, they are hardly silent), released (in 1931 and 1936) long after the rest of Hollywood had given up on the silent cinema. Both films are deeply engaged in the social and economic realities of the Great Depression, which, if anything, makes them timelier today. In ''City Lights'' Chaplin is a citizen of the streets who goes from sleeping in the arms of a civic statue to fighting back his impossible love for a blind flower girl. ''Modern Times'' imagines him almost literally as a cog in the gigantic machine of American capitalism, a factory worker who befriends an orphan (Paulette Goddard) and dreams of the open road. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center , (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org. Single tickets: $11; $8 for 62+; $7 for students and children. Both films: $15; $11 for 62+; $9 for students and children. (Dave Kehr)20091217"

For decades this innocent awe somehow sustained the boy as he meandered into adulthood and the drabness of real life.

Perminov, the head of Russia's space agency, during an interview on Russian radio on Wednesday. Mr. Perminov said Apophis, named for the Egyptian god of destruction, is about three times the size of the Tunguska meteorite, apparently the cause of a 1908 explosion in Siberia that knocked over an estimated 80 million trees. He said that according to his experts' calculation, there was still time to design a spacecraft that could alter Apophis's path before it made a dangerous swing toward Earth."
