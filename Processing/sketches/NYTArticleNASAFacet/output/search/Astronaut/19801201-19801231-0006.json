But it was generally agreed by industry analysts that, because Braniff has suffered heavy financial setbacks in the two years since airline deregulation, Eastern would do the absorbing."

The move to the launch pad was a sign that Federal space officials believe the worst of the space shuttle's problems are behind it. The hybrid rocket-airplane, poised vertically for flight, was carried on the back of a giant crawler-transporter, as though on a moving football field, to the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. It had spent five weeks in the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building, three and a half miles away, undergoing checkout."
