Lately, it's not enough for a man to master a single job, or even a single field of endeavor. Today's master of the universe is a hyphenate. We have actors who are also writer-directors, singers who are painters, painters who are directors, sports stars who are designers, designers who are talk-show hosts and athletes who are politicians, to mention just a few of the more vivid examples. Take Stephen Chow, the man on our cover. Chow is the star of Hong Kong cinema's biggest-grossing film, ''Shaolin Soccer.'' He also produced, co-directed and co-wrote the movie. And, yes, those tails he's wearing are proof positive that elegance is back. Especially when you're practicing kung fu. Or crooning a standard, like the singers we dressed for ''Set 'Em Up, Joe * ''"

We decided on the trip, along with our friends Tom and Susan, in January 2001, just days after all of us had enjoyed a one-week cruise around Tahiti on another Radisson ship, the Paul Gauguin. There was a window of opportunity in our lives: we were retired from regular jobs and in good health, fit enough to enjoy strenuous side trips."
