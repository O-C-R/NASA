The comedies they made for Universal from the late 1950's to the mid-60's -- with each other and with surrogates ranging from Cary Grant to Gina Lollobrigida -- were the product of a moment when the incipient sexual revolution collided with the moribund Hollywood Production Code in an explosion of bright color, lush music and naughty innuendo. These entertainments (''Pillow Talk,'' ''Lover Come Back'' and ''Send Me No Flowers'') were at once dopey and ingenious, wholesome and sophisticated, teasing their audiences, as the romantic principals teased each other, by pretending to be what they were not: subversive when they were in fact conventional, and vice versa."

In this multigenre film, a young woman (Lee Sin-je) who has been blind for 18 years receives a corneal transplant and, as a result, can see again. There is a nasty side effect, though: she sees ghosts and monsters and seems to be able to predict people's deaths. With Lawrence Chou, Chutcha Rujinanon and Candy Lo."

''What I like about it, and what I hope other people will like about it, is that there is no attempt to make the movie look realistic or to make it gritty,'' said the director Peyton Reed. ''All the apartments and the wardrobes do not have that lived-in look. No wear-and-tear. No wrinkles. Our movie is the idea of New York City as seen through the lens of a 1960's Hollywood movie camera.''"
