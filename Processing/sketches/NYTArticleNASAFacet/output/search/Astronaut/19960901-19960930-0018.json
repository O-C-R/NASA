Since 1992, they've released 22 singles and 6 albums; the newest is ''Experiment Zero,'' (Touch and Go Records). Their lead guitarist is named Star Crunch, and on Thursday night at Irving Plaza, the band performed in no-budget approximations of astronaut gear (second-hand auto-mechanic's outfits) amid fuzzy black and white television sets, and old, blinking word-processors. Behind them ran film footage of space landings, Indy 500 races and other stuff."

In her place the Atlantis left behind another American, John E. Blaha, a 54-year-old retired Air Force colonel, to begin a four-month tour aboard the Mir."

Mr. Leigh, celebrated for his patient, Olympian methods with actors, deliberately keeps those players in the dark as a way of capturing an essential inner light. That light shines radiantly through the revelations of ''Secrets and Lies,'' which won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes International Film Festival and will now establish this once insular English film maker on a much broader commercial footing. It opens the 34th New York Film Festival tonight on a note of rare heart and soul."
