(MoreMax) MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE (2011) Elizabeth Olsen, the younger sister of Ashley and Mary-Kate, portrays Martha, a young woman who has escaped from a cult in rural New York and found refuge with her older sister, Lucy (Sarah Paulson, above left with Ms. Olsen), and brother-in-law, Ted (Hugh Dancy), at their rented lakeside vacation home. Martha has been renamed Marcy May by Patrick (John Hawkes), the leader of the cult who initiates female acolytes into the group by drugging and raping them. (Marlene is the all-purpose pseudonym female cult members use when answering the phone.) But life with Lucy and Ted has its own difficulties, and Patrick's teachings aren't easily purged. ''Ms. Olsen's performance is both the key to the film and the source of its sometimes frustrating opacity,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But the cutting back and forth between Patrick's farm and Ted and Lucy's middle-class dream ''starts to seem like a trick, and the ingenuity of the movie's structure begins to feel evasive rather than probing,'' he said. ''The drama is all in the jumps and juxtapositions, rather than in any sustained consideration of Martha's experience. She remains a blank space in the middle of a film that is an impressive piece of work without achieving quite the emotional impact it intends.'' 10 A.M. (Fox News) AMERICA'S NEWSROOM Bret Baier reports on the memorial service of the astronaut Neil Armstrong from the National Cathedral in Washington. Mr. Armstrong died last month at 82."

      "lead_paragraph": "BILLIAN--Douglas Charles, of Atlanta, Georgia and New York City, passed away on Saturday morning, September 15, 2012 at his home in Atlanta. After a courageous battle with a brain tumor, he spent his last days surrounded by his loving family, friends, and his devoted wife Louise \"Lulu\" Billian. Doug was born on March 13, 1928, to Elsie Adelaide (nee Bowers) and Alfred Arthur Billian in Bound Brook, NJ. His lifelong passion for scouting began as a young boy when he followed his brothers into the Boy Scouts. He attained the level of Eagle Scout with bronze, silver, and gold palms and The Order of the Arrow. Through the years he has generously supported the Boy Scouts of America to encourage what he believed contributed to his own success. After graduating from the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern University (which he attended under the U.S. Navy Holloway Midshipman Program), Billian received his Naval commission just prior to the Korean War outbreak, serving 1950 to 1953. After a twenty-year career with the McGraw Hill Publishing Company on publications such as Purchasing Week, Aviation Week and Business Week, Doug launched Billian Publishing, Inc., in 1978, with the acquisition of Golf World magazine (sold a decade later to the New York Times Group). Subsequent acquisitions include Textile World, Art & Antiques and Boating World. Today, Billian Publishing Inc. thrives primarily serving the healthcare industry with Billian's HealthDATA, Porter Research and Healthcare IT Research (HITR). The Textile Industries Media Group is the leading resource for textile news and information from around the globe. Its international titles include Textile World, Textiles Panamericanos and Textile World Asia. The Billians supported many art shows including The Winter Antiques Show in New York, Grosvenor House Antiques Fair in London, The San Francisco Antiques Show and numerous others. Doug Billian was a member of Cherokee Town & Country Club and The University Yacht Club, and a former member of Pinehurst Country Club and Magazine Publishers Association. He was a proud lifetime member of the National Association of Eagle Scouts sponsored by fellow Scout, Astronaut Jim Lovell. He served on the Board of Trustees of The United States Golf Association, Meals on Wheels Atlanta, and as Chairman of the IFC Senior Citizens Foundation. He is survived by his devoted wife of 26 years, Louise Lindsey Billian. He is also survived by his children, Tracey Billian Krause, Martha Billian Meyer with spouse Dan, Lindsey Perkins Mullen with spouse Tim, Charles Jackson \"Jay\" Perkins, Jr. with spouse Michelle, Douglas C. Billian Jr. with spouse Jennifer, eleven grandchildren, his brother Alfred Billian Jr. of Ft. Wayne, IN, and many nieces and nephews. Doug Billian will be remembered for his incredibly high moral standards, honorable character, utmost integrity and taking pride in all you do. His unrelenting work ethic, coupled with his love of publishing and investing, contributed to his success. However, his intense belief in providing for his family drove his ambition. He taught us all by the honorable life he led and those whose lives he touched have been inspired by his example. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Boy Scouts of America, Meals on Wheels Atlanta, Hospice Atlanta or your favorite charity."
