The shock and grief, the numbness we all experienced at having Christa McAuliffe so suddenly taken from our midst Tuesday morning is beyond the power of words to express. But through the silence of sorrow we can say that your burden is not only the burden of all Americans, but of people throughout the world who saw in Christa what you who knew her best saw in her - a woman of courage and caring, an educator of boundless energy and inexhaustible enthusiasm, an inspiration to young and old alike."

The disaster of the space shuttle would have been dreadful enough even if we had not forgotten that astronauts work close to the edges of death, but having our foolish delusions about rocketry destroyed in a flash of light turned the event into a national horror. Afterward the first official statements emphasized the Government's determination to pursue the rocketry program despite such events. These statements were inevitable and sensible and made the sensible point that in this kind of work there will always be black days."

About 500 people, some on skateboards and bicycles, watched solemnly. Spaced one minute apart, the shots above the park's Belvedere Castle were followed by a brief nonsectarian prayer from Mayor Koch. ''Oh Lord, we pray that you may receive the souls of these your servants,' he said. ''They died in service of their country and in service of all mankind. We shall remember them always.'' After the service, one of many around the country in honor of the seven astronauts, Henry J. Stern, Parks and Recreation Commissioner, told reporters that 122nd Street between Third Avenue and Lexington would be renamed McNair Place, in memory of Dr. Ronald E. McNair, the mission specialist whose father once owned an automobile repair shop there."

The panel, the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, will take over responsiblity for examining the accident, replacing the board already convened by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as the official investigative body. Report Due in 120 Days William R. Graham, Acting Administrator of the space agency, who attended a White House meeting where Mr. Reagan announced he was creating the panel, said the launching of future shuttles would be suspended until the commission completed its investigation. The group is to report to the President and the NASA Administrator within 120 days."

Yet only recently have scientists been able to demonstrate the forces that control these ''northern lights.'' In particular the scientists believe they have discovered, through computer simulations and laboratory experiments, the cause of the strikingly uniform folds that often appear in the aurora. Some hope, in addition, to manipulate and ''orchestrate'' aurora displays by beaming powerful radio waves up from the ground. Recent tests have also indicated that a related phenomenon, the polar electrojet, a ''river of electricity'' flowing through the upper atmosphere, may have a practical application. In Norway the electrojet has been used to create extremely low-frequency (ELF) radio waves of the type that the United States Navy would like to use for communication with submerged submarines."

It is work of ancient and brutal rhythms, a Daguerrotype, almost, of traditional Southern black field labor. Beginning at daybreak, as the dew evaporated in the warming air, the men and women made their way down the rows, bending, plucking, shuffling forward, dragging their sacks, stooping and reaching under the high arc of the sun as the earth grew radiant and the fields shimmered with heat. ''Your back felt like two razor blades meeting,'' Joseph A. Wilson 2d recalls. It took strength. At $4 a day, it took endurance. One had to need the money in order to do that work. But in some cases, it helped make people strong. Here in Lake City, a doctor, a lawyer, an astronaut, a biologist, an entrepreneur and a computer analyst rose from those fields."

Among them are your budget, how long you plan to be away and what part of the world you want to sail in - the Caribbean, Mexico, Alaska, Europe, the Mediterranean or the South Pacific. Other considerations are time of year and whether, depending on your preference, the itinerary calls for a preponderance of lazy days at sea or frequent stops at ports. One of the most important factors, however, is what sort of entertainment the cruise offers. The caliber of professional entertainment, or the seriousness with which a cruise pursues a theme (such as classical music, tournament bridge, archeology, financial planning or - this year particularly - astronomy and Halley's Comet), can go far toward determining whether you will enjoy it. The type of entertainment may also indicate what sort of passengers are likely to be on board. ''In the summer, you get a lot of kids, so you book Sha Na Na, that sort of thing,'' said Leo Silverstein, a cruise talent agent in Boca Raton, Fla., in a telephone interview. ''In the winter, the passengers tend to be older, so you give them the Vic Damones, the Petula Clarks, the Jerry Lewises.''"

They are the words of the Pittsburgh school's founder, Andrew Carnegie, but they could be an epitaph for one of the school's most accomplished engineering graduates, Judith A. Resnik. ''Judy was an astronaut's astronaut,'' said Henry Hartsfield, the commander of the 1984 Discovery mission on which she flew. ''She was not satisfied with second best.'' On that first mission, the fledgling astronaut conducted experiments with the shuttlecraft's solar energy instruments. A Complex Personality But Dr. Resnik's reputation for hard work and professionalism did not reflect the full range of her complex personality, according to people who knew her. She captured the imagination not only because she excelled in a competitive profession, but also because she did not seem to match any popular notion of a NASA ''type.'' In the words of a stepsister, ''She wasn't all-American.''"

Eileen O'Hara, a friend from Concord, asked how it felt to sit in the orbiter waiting for a liftoff that did not come. ''Go borrow a motorcycle helmet,'' Mrs. McAuliffe reportedly said. ''Lie on the floor, with your legs up on the bed. Lie there for five hours. You can't read, you can't have anything loose around, you're strapped down really tightly, with oxygen lines and wires coming out of your suit. The only people who had anything to do were the pilot and the co-pilot.'' But there was one thing about the delay: it gave her family and friends time to have a nice party at Cape Canaveral and she was glad about that, though she could not attend because of preflight quarantine."

The wide Atlantic sky is speckled with motion, from the graceful dance of sea birds to the sharp, swift flight of military aircraft. As a North Carolina farm boy, Mike Smith learned to work the land, but grew to love the sky. He learned to fly as a teen-ager, soaring in a small plane over the sandy spits and pine forests of the Outer Banks, not far from where the Wright Brothers first took to the air. ''Flying is just something that came natural to Mike,'' said his brother Patrick, 39 years old, himself a jet pilot. ''It didn't matter whether it was small airplanes or a jet, he just really loved to fly.''"

''He said he had acquired everything he wanted in life,'' she said. Dick Scobee, the little boy who hung so many model airplanes from the ceiling of his room that anyone entering would bump his head on them, died at the command controls of the ultimate airplane, the shuttle Challenger. That he should have risen to such prominence is a source of some marvel to many who knew him when he was young. He was a good but not brilliant student who worked hard. He was a slow football player, but if no one else showed up for practice, Dick Scobee did. Without the privilege of going to the Air Force Academy, he became a pilot and officer the hard way, starting as a enlisted man repairing propeller engines."

Whoosh. This one, bounding down the center of the fairway, expires 266 yards away. Some golfer. Fortunately, you'll never have to meet him in the finals of the club championship. He's a robot. This really isn't the 9th hole at Kittansett. This is inside a theater-like room in New Bedford, Mass., at a laboratory of the Acushnet Company, one of the dominant makers of golf balls. The robot - known as ''Iron Byron,'' since its swing mimicks the classic motion of the stellar professional, Byron Nelson - is firing balls at a net, behind which is a slide projection of Kittansett's 9th hole. Infrared cameras connected to a computer reveal precisely where - and how far -the balls went. The researchers have been studying the aerodynamics of a golf ball, in particular what happens when you change the little circular indentations known as dimples."

PAUL WEST'S 10th novel, ''Rat Man of Paris,'' addresses the large question of our time: How does one live one's daily life in the span between past atrocity and atrocity to come? What happens to the wound that does not heal, that will not scar over? Paul West has imagined the mind and times of the historical Rat Man, who used to walk the boulevards of Paris several years ago, opening his coat to flash a live rodent in the faces of strolling Parisians and the tourists in the cafes. He has imagined Rat Man's childhood in an Alsatian village during the Second World War, the inside of Rat Man's room in a derelict Paris street - and he has imagined Rat Man's imagination in the act of producing his several symbolic street performances. The act in which Rat Man carries a picture of ''the Boche'' through the streets of Paris earns him a bullet, fired at him - is it from the right fringe or the left? But at the core of this wonderful book that is about atrocity, Paul West has also allowed Rat Man the goodness of reciprocal love."

The presence here of the panel member, Dr. Richard P. Feynman, highlights the growing concern that cold temperatures may have played a major role in the explosion of the Challenger Jan. 28, killing the seven astronauts. Launching pad technicians using an infrared temperature sensing device discovered unusually cold spots on the lower part of the Challenger's right-hand solid-fuel booster rocket shortly before the spacecraft began its fatal flight, sources said today. But the readings, which indicate that the right booster's skin was surprisingly colder than that of the left booster rocket, were not passed along to higher officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who later made the decision to launch the Challenger, space agency officials testified at a hearing in Washington today."

HOLLINGS, Democrat of South Carolina: At this particular juncture it seems like an avoidable accident rather than an unavoidable one. And the only way that we who support the space program are ever going to maintain any credibility in support for it is to make absolutely sure that no accidents like this will ever occur again. I want to make sure that this committee gets every bit of evidence. I've served on Presidential commissions and it's just impossible to get all the situation together. An adversary type proceeding of investigators is necessary to really get us to a conclusive result. WILLIAM P. ROGERS, Chairman of the Commission: The President has asked the commission to take a hard and objective look at the accident, to take a calm, deliberate and independent assessment of the facts, to find out if possible how this accident happened, the causes - the cause or causes -and to recommend ways to avoid a repetition of this tragedy, and finally, to submit a full report within 120 days of the commission's formation on Feb. 3."

The disclosure was made today at an often combative Senate subcommittee hearing at which the official, Jesse W. Moore, testified that he would have asked more probing questions if he had been told about the low temperature readings. However, Dr. William R. Graham, acting director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, cautioned that the readings were made with optical infrared devices that were ''not easy instruments to operate'' and he warned that measurement errors ''could be quite substantial.'' Mr. Moore, the Associate Administrator for space flight at NASA, told the Senate Commerce subcommittee on space that special ice teams went out on the launching pad at 1:30 A.M., 7 A.M., and 11 A.M. the day of the flight, primarily to determine whether ice on the launching pad or the shuttle's giant fuel tank might break off and damage the shuttle's fragile thermal protection tiles."

He said he was fascinated by most of what he saw, if taken aback a bit by the Texas heat, which hit a humid 87 degrees as he toured the San Jacinto Monument outside Houston. The monument marks the site of a battle on April 21, 1836, in which Texas forces led by Gen. Sam Houston defeated the Mexican Army of Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

One source familiar with the investigation said it would be a ''reasonable assumption'' that the apparent failure by middle-level NASA officials to pass on the warnings prompted the commission to issue its statement over the weekend that the process leading to the decision to launch ''may have been flawed.''"

At a news conference this morning, Jesse W. Moore, the space agency official who gave final approval for the launching, reiterated that he had never been informed of a near-rebellion among the manufacturers' engineers fearful that a launching would lead to disaster. The explosion, 73 seconds into liftoff, killed the seven astronauts on board. New Executive Is Named As expected, Mr. Moore announced he was relinquishing his position as associate administrator in charge of the shuttle project while remaining head of the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Rear. Adm. Richard H. Truly of the Navy is to replace him. [ Page A12. ] Tonight, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration released the document it received from the booster manufacturer the night before the Jan. 28 launching giving final authorization to proceed. Signed by Joseph C. Kilminster, Morton Thiokol Inc.'s vice president for space booster programs, the one-page assessment warned that the O rings sealing critical joints on the booster would harden in the cold and thus take longer to ''seat'' properly, but concludeed with a statement that Morton Thiokol ''recommends STS-51L launch proceed on 28 January 1986.''"

Now, as director of the shuttle program, Rear Admiral Truly's diplomatic restraint as well as professional prestige will be indispensible to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in its campaign to re-establish public trust after the Challenger disaster. At the age of 48, Admiral Truly, NASA's new associate administrator for space flight, has risen high in two intertwined but separate careers: those of a naval aviator and administrator, and of a NASA astronaut. A consummate pilot, he specialized in difficult night landings, both in carrier-based combat aircraft and in the space shuttle itself. Equally skilled as an administrator, he has served since Oct. 1, 1983, as commander of the Naval Space Command, an agency responsible for all the Navy's surveillance and communications satellites."

Those questions were raised by a disquieting series of revelations last week concerning the launching of the ill-fated space shuttle Challenger. As a Presidential panel pieced together the events that led to America's worst space tragedy, NASA documents showed that agency officials had during the last few years repeatedly discussed potential problems with the O rings, the seals in the shuttle's solid fuel booster rockets that are supposed to prevent explosive gas from leaking. The rings are prime suspects in the blast that killed all seven Challenger crew members Jan. 28. But yesterday, a former official of Morton Thiokol Inc., the company that built the boosters, said he thought the explosion may have been caused by a leak in the shuttle's huge external fuel tank."

A leak of supercold hydrogen gas from the external tank had initially been a major focus of theories on the disaster's cause. But attention shifted to the booster rockets after photographs showed a plume of flame coming from the right-side booster and after a loss in thrust in the booster after liftoff was reported. Earlier this week Neil A. Armstrong, the former astronaut who is vice chairman of the Presidential commission investigating the shuttle explosion, said a leak of supercold gas from the tank was ''one of a number of scenarios'' still being examined."

An official of the International Association of Machinists union and two Eastern outside directors said that the former astronaut planned to resign from the company. Speculation intensified that Mr. Borman, who headed the Gemini 7 and Apollo 8 missions, might become the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Mr. Borman, who joined Eastern as senior vice president for operations in 1970 and became chief executive in 1975, could not be reached for comment yesterday. But Jerry Cosley, Eastern's senior vice president for corporate communications, quoted Mr. Borman, 58 years old, as saying ''as far as I know I wasn't offered a job'' at Texas Air."

Suspect components, cold weather and some apparent lapses in human judgment all seem to be implicated. The pieces of the puzzle, when fitted together, begin to tell of the roles of key engineers and managers in critical shuttle decisions, the knowledge available to them and withheld from them and the pressures under which they worked and made the decision to launch the Challenger on its last mission - a mission that would bring the American space enterprise to an indefinite halt. With public hearings into the disaster set to resume today, a cascade of new disclosures is likely to expose other flaws in shuttle systems and in the decision-making process leading up to the launching on Jan. 28 that killed all seven aboard the Challenger. More questions will undoubtedly be raised about malfunctions in the right booster rocket. New evidence will be presented about serious safety concerns that, for reasons that are still mysterious, were not called to the attention of top space agency managers."

No one, least of all the clearly agitated members of the Presidential panel investigating the disaster, seemed able to explain the cause of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's apparent insistence that the liftoff proceed on Jan. 28. But for the first time, the session today suggested a significant change of attitude within the space agency - a new attitude that may have dismissed or ignored warnings last August by engineers for the builder of the shuttle's booster rockets that disaster was in the offing, an attitude that, the night before launching, subtly created pressure to keep quiet and keep on schedule. In the past, the engineers for Morton Thiokol Inc. testified, they were forced to defend every assertion that their equipment was ready for a safe launching. But this time, ''I had the feeling we were in the position of proving it was unsafe, instead of the other way around,'' said Brian Russell, one of several who strongly urged the company to block a launching, only to be reversed by upper-level managers."

The Challenger space-shuttle tragedy reminded us that being an astronaut is a hazardous job. It should suggest that we owe a debt to those who have the courage to accept the risks in carrying out our space-exploration program. Being launched into space is a dangerous enterprise for those who are sitting atop the large rocket system."

Its principal function for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is building spacecraft, although it performs other important tasks for the agency. It assists in flight planning, astronaut training and other support work, and it has led a project to build individual components that could be assembled form a new spacecraft."
