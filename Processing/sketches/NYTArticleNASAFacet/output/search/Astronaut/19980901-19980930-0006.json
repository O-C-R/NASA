'' 'Apollo 13' was vertically integrated,'' he said. '' 'From the Earth to the Moon' was horizontal.'' Mr. Scott sees a movie as focusing on a facet or two and then delving deeply. With more time to spend, a mini-series spills outward into the nooks and crannies, spreading itself more thinly but covering more ground."

Like a space capsule on the fritz, the play gets stuck in perpetual orbit, floating somewhere out there, high above our heads. Mr. Guare prefigured the millennium craze when he wrote the play in 1977 and set it in 1999, on the cusp of the new century. It's weirdly prophetic in several jarring instances, with references, for example, to the ubiquity of videocassettes, Middle East detente and even a sex scandal in the White House."
