With NASA bracing for the looming retirement of the shuttle fleet after a final three missions, Atlantis roared to life and rocketed away from its seaside pad at 2:20 p.m. Eastern time. The eight-and-a-half-minute ascent appeared normal as the spacecraft climbed through a partly cloudy sky, putting on a familiar, soon-to-be-missed show for area residents and tourists who turned out in droves to catch a glimpse of Atlantis's final launching."

Some fiddle with cameras on tripods while others sit in camp chairs, slapping at mosquitoes and checking their cellphones for updates. A voice comes over a loudspeaker: ''T minus 9 minutes and counting.'' After hours of excruciating anticipation, the final checks for the space shuttle launching have been made and all systems are go. Parents chase after small children dressed up in orange astronaut suits who can no longer contain their excitement. There is a collective gasp at T minus 2 minutes, 55 seconds, when the so-called ''beanie cap,'' or oxygen vent arm, retracts, making it appear that the shuttle is tipping its hat in farewell. T minus zero and there is a brilliant burst of billowing flame and a thunderous roar that shakes the ground and vibrates vital organs."

He has already been a Chicago gangster (that would be ''Robin and the 7 Hoods,'' with Frank Sinatra as Robbo) and a duck (that would be Daffy). Lots of actors have played him, most immortally Errol Flynn, but Douglas Fairbanks, Kevin Costner and Sean Connery (not the laddish version) have also taken an arrow from the quiver. Last week, Ridley Scott's ''Robin Hood'' opened, with Russell Crowe as Robin. The film is something of a prequel to the tale of the band that roams the Sherwood Forest. But it doesn't matter who inhabits the shape-shifting myth or what the setting. There's apparently a Robin Hood for everyone, in these hard times or any other. You don't have to be a socialist intent on relieving the rich of their plunder and redistributing it to the deserving poor. You can be a libertarian or a tea partier, relieving a sprawling government of its extra power and returning it to the people. In the future, perhaps when most of the world is ocean, there might be a band of mermen who raid yachts to provision our dinghies and fatten up the obesity-free friar. Just guessing."

He could, though, get in touch with a doctor thousands of miles away, via two-way video. Using an electronic stethoscope that a paramedic on the rig held in place, Dr. Oscar W. Boultinghouse, an emergency medicine physician in Houston, listened to Mr. Martin's heart."
