Mike's inspiration: Ben (Peter ten Brink), a boy with Down syndrome who dreams of becoming an astronaut. Jessy Schram plays Robynn McKinney, a fellow teacher who helps Mike buck the opposition of school administrators. And Cynthia Watros is Dr. Deborah Barnhart, the Space Camp official who is skeptical that Mike's class will be able to hold its own with some of the brightest science students from across the country. The cast includes young actors with Down syndrome, autism and learning disabilities. 9 A.M.
