Today, more than 800 products bearing his name are sold in more than 140 countries. The business brings in a reported $1 billion a year, and Cardin, who just turned 80, is still the captain of his ship, making every deal himself. In 1959, he shocked the fashion world by presenting his first licensed ready-to-wear collection at the Paris department store Printemps. Cardin had ''sold out.'' He had come from the rarefied world of couture, working at Paquin, Schiaparelli and Christian Dior. Suddenly he was putting his name on clothing being sold off the rack. Today, with designer names splattered on everything, it's impossible to imagine that it wasn't always like this. Cardin saw the future before anyone else."
