But Eddie (Paul Schulze) -- the hospital's former pharmacist and Jackie's former drug dispenser and lover -- doesn't make it any easier when he shows up in the emergency room after overdosing. In the season premiere of ''United States of Tara,'' at 10:30, Tara Gregson (Toni Collette) has enjoyed life without dissociation for several months, so she decides to make some friends with the help of her husband, Max (John Corbett). Then a neighbor commits suicide and leaves the Gregsons with responsibility for the house and estate. 8 P.M. (BBC America) TOP GEAR Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May do their part to save the planet by building an electric car with batteries from a milk float, a delivery vehicle common in Britain. They then tour Oxford before submitting their creation to the new-car testing process. Later the men head to the track for a battle of the continents, with North America represented by the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 and Europe by the Audi R8 V10. Michael Sheen of ''Frost/Nixon'' is the star in a reasonably priced car."
