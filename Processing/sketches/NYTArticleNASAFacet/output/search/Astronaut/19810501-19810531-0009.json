They have now spent many years in the remotest corners of Africa and Asia, enduring isolation, torrential rains, heat, insects and, in the cases of two of them, long separations from their sons, who were thousands of miles away in England and British Columbia. This week Dian Fossey, Jane Goodall and Birute Galdikas came together in a rare meeting to talk about ''What We Can Learn About Humankind From the Apes'' at a symposium on the Sweet Briar College campus, which was drenched in the white dogwood and azalea of a Southern spring. 'You're My Idol' They have become three of the world's foremost primatologists, those who study the great apes, with Dr. Fossey specializing in mountain gorillas, Dr. Goodall in chimpanzees and Dr. Galdikas in orangutans. Their lectures and slides appeared to enthrall the anthropologists, sociologists, zoologists, alumnae, students and those just curious to see three women who are fast becoming legends in their field. ''Jane Goodall,'' one young man said solemnly, ''you're my idol.''"

The resulting accident took the lives of 273 men, women and children. The plane was grounded for 38 days. The McDonnell Douglas Corporation estimated that 10 percent of the public avoided DC-10's after the plane resumed operation. ''It still hurts to talk about it,'' said James Burton, director of marketing for McDonnell Douglas, maker of the DC-10. While passenger fear could be soothed with time and a media blitz featuring Pete Conrad, the former astronaut, vouching for the company's superior technology, the commercial aircraft business at McDonnell Douglas is still burdened with the legacy of May 25, 1979."

Even though the Soviet Union has not said so officially, another space station is expected to replace the 21-ton cylindrical Salyut 6, which is about the size of a small mobile home. According to American analysts of the Soviet program, the new vehicle could be more complex and capable of being enlarged through attached modules. 4 Test Flights Successful Further evidence that the Russians may have reached a transition point in their space program was a statement made last week by a Soviet astronaut, Leonid Popov, that there would be no more flights with the old-model Soyuz spacecraft."
