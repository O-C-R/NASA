Having lost her job, the resilient Jeannette makes the best of it amid neighbors who get through hard times by sharing warm friendships and populist political ideas. One of her sons, by different men, is Catholic, while the other is Muslim, adding religious considerations to a warm, rich film with ''a strong, hearty, down-to-earth spirit throughout,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. 1998. New Yorker. $89.98. 102 minutes. French with English subtitles. No rating."

Not to worry. Without missing a beat, Mr. Cass, in a NASA jumpsuit embellished with space patches (the kind that resemble an auto mechanic's, not the astronauts from ''E.T.''), seized the opportunity to teach another kind of lesson instead of the one in the lesson plan."
