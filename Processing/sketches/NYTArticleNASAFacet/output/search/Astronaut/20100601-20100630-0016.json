This documentary also offers glimpses of daily classes and rehearsals and ventures behind the scenes at the elegant Palais Garnier, with its scarlet velvet seats and Marc Chagall ceiling, to watch choreographers, ballet masters, musicians and production designers at work. ''To say that the film, sumptuous in its length and graceful in its rhythm, is a feast for ballet lovers is to state the obvious and also to sell Mr. Wiseman's achievement a bit short,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''Yes, this is one of the finest dance films ever made, but there's more to it than that.'' 8 P.M.
