Take something to sit on and wear dancing shoes, because a large wooden dance floor will be available for jitterbugs, Lindy hoppers and Lambeth walkers. A flashlight is also recommended for finding your car at the end of the evening. For those who don't bring food from home, a concession will sell hot dogs, soda, juice, candy and ice cream."

As though fearing that the story of an authentic martyr of the black civil rights struggle was not strong enough to be told in a straightforward way, the British producers of \"Southern Justice: The Murder of Medgar Evers\" have gussied it up with re-enactments, flaming crosses, flashing lights and other banal images and effects so overworked on television. They only get in the way of the inherently inspiring story of a black N.A.A.C.P. worker who dared do battle with the powers that controlled much of the South in the 1950's and 60's. Evers's courage in investigating and publicizing the murders of blacks that went unpunished by all-white juries, fighting for voter registration and school desegregation and leading boycotts against Jackson, Miss., stores needs no trivializing adornments."
