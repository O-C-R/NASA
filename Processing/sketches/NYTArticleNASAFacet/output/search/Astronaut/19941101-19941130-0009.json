On Oct. 25 she was killed in a crash off Southern California, the 10th F-14 aviator to die in a training accident in that notoriously ungainly aircraft since 1992. The cause is not yet known, but some of her fellow aviators offered a quick, unfounded and appallingly insensitive opinion. Lieutenant Hultgreen died, they said in faxes to several California news organizations, because she was a woman -- and as such not up to playing on their team."

Over the years, I still learned some very important life lessons from Barbie. 1. Family Is Fundamental: Barbie's my age and, as the long-awaited only girl in a suburban clan of boys, I was Mattel's dream customer. I had 68 Barbies who shared a pink plastic convertible car and split-level condominium, along with 12 Little Kiddles and 28 Dawn dolls so tiny that instead of changing their clothes I just switched their heads."

An American astronaut, Norman E. Thagard, is to fly into orbit atop a Russian rocket and work for three months in a Russian space station. Dr. Thagard, a physician, was to have performed biomedical experiments with American equipment while aboard the Russian space station, which is known as Mir."
