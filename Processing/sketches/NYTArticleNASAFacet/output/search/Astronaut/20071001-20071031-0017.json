The shuttle commander, Pam Melroy, is a retired Air Force colonel who picked up the nickname ''Pambo.'' The pilot, Col. George Zamka of the Marine Corps, had picked up the call sign ''Zambo.'' ''It just so happened we got assigned to the same crew,'' Col. Zamka said in an interview, ''and we decided we could either embrace it or run away from it. And I wanted to run away from it, but the rest of the crew wouldn't do it. So we're all some kind of 'bo' name.''"

The problem concerns a rotary joint on the right side of the station that turns the station's solar arrays so they face the sun during orbit. During an initial examination on Sunday, the spacewalking astronaut Daniel M. Tani collected what he called ''metal-to-metal scraping'' that peppered the inside of the joint mechanism. Mr. Tani picked up some of the fragments with tape and took them back into the space station."
