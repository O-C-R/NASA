She passed out the bios of the four possible donors from the sperm bank. Everyone agreed she should pick the Mormon bongo player (which makes you wonder about the other three) and in less than half an hour Mary Jo was artificially inseminated, got pregnant, miscarried and vowed to try again. She is already a step ahead of Rosie O'Neill, who so far has only discussed artificial insemination with her psychiatrist on \"The Trials of Rosie O'Neill.\" Meanwhile, it is becoming tough to distinguish some shows from commercials for home pregnancy tests. \"The stick is blue,\" the pregnant Murphy Brown cryptically told her best friend, Frank. \"Please, God, please don't let it be blue,\" prayed Ava, the middle-aged mom in \"Evening Shade.\" Teddy, the rebellious sibling on \"Sisters,\" looked ill at the positive blue-toned reading of her home pregnancy test. Rebecca on \"Cheers\" was disappointed at the negative results of hers and Hannah on \"Anything but Love\" learned that home pregnancy tests can lie. It is just four weeks into the new television season, and already you can't tell the pregnancies, the false alarms and the in vitro fertilizations without a score card."

Ralph Crane's 1953 photos of the cavernous Hofbrauhaus in Munich, filled with small faces of waitresses and beer-drinking customers, is a surprise, too."
