      "lead_paragraph": "MOSCOW -- The announcement on Tuesday by the Russian space agency that it will delay the launching of the next crew to the International Space Station is a concern for NASA, which is relying solely on the Russians for astronaut transportation. The end of the space shuttle program after the last flight in July was meant to usher in a new era where NASA could move on to more ambitious destinations and nimbler, cheaper private companies would take over the job of ferrying people and supplies to the orbiting research station. But a series of recent rocket malfunctions -- including one on Aug. 24 by a Russian ship that was taking supplies to the space station -- has made this approach look tenuous."

NOON (FX) GHOST TOWN (2008) Ricky Gervais, near right, plays Bertram Pincus, a misanthropic Manhattan dentist who sees spirits after having a near-death experience during a colonoscopy. Greg Kinnear is Frank Herlihy, a two-timing yuppie who was hit by a bus while trying to avoid a falling air-conditioner. And Téa Leoni is Frank's widow, Gwen, whom he wants Bertram to befriend and prevent from remarrying. She hates Bertram at first, and then she doesn't."
