Most of the action heroes are sitting the season out, so not a single comet, meteor, dinosaur or giant gorilla is poised to destroy us all. Instead there are a swarm of romantic comedies, lovable animated robots and apemen for the children, and more restorations, rereleases and directors' cuts than you can shake a light-saber at. In this selective list, some opening dates are for New York only and at least a few are sure to change even as you're reading this. Sequels, Prequels and Remakes THE MUMMY A romantic adventure version of the 1932 Boris Karloff horror picture. It's still about a 3,000-year-old Egyptian corpse that comes to life, complete with terrible curse. Brendan Fraser stars as a dashing legionnaire; Rachel Weisz is his Egypt-savvy love interest. Directed by Stephen Sommers. Opens Friday."

It can certainly be applied to the 86 paintings, sculptures, drawings and photographs in the current exhibition at the Yoshii Gallery. Together they amount to a pocket history of 20th-century art. Almost all the big names are there, from Matisse and Picasso to Miro and Arp and Magritte and Calder and Dubuffet and Pollock. Among today's front-runners are Ellsworth Kelly, Brice Marden, Gerhard Richter, John Chamberlain, Kiki Smith and Sol LeWitt."

That characterization never bothered most people in Oregon's biggest city very much -- they were content with their demure hometown, and just as happy that the rest of the country didn't pay it undue attention. But in recent years, Portland has become more like Cinderella. This verdant, biker- and pedestrian-friendly city, which tore down a freeway to make room for a magnificent riverfront park, is routinely held up as a national model of how to do things right. On long summer days, with snowy Mount Hood looming to the east, it is one of the most beautiful urban settings anywhere."
