All might have won Republican seats; two or three certainly would have. Without them in the field, all five seats at stake, hence the Senate majority, are likely to remain Republican. My more or less informed guess - based on conversations with Republican, Democratic and nonpartisan analysts - is that the Democrats will gain a net of three, perhaps four seats. But they need to pick up six, or five in the event Geraldine Ferraro becomes Vice President and presiding officer of the Senate. She could then vote to break ties in favor of the Democrats."

Lousma, one of the two men contending Tuesday for the Republican nomination for the Senate from Michigan, is asked to do a microphone test, he usually responds with a countdown: ''five, four, three, two, one.'' The gesture is a reminder that Mr. Lousma is a former astronaut who was a member of the second crew to occupy the Skylab space station in 1973 and spent more than 11 hours hours outskide the Skylab in two separate space walks. He also commanded the third flight of the space shuttle Columbia in March 1982. Mr. Lousma is locked in what appears to be a tight race with James Dunn, who served one term in the House of Representatives from the Lansing area. A recent poll conducted for The Detroit Free Press showed Mr. Dunn leading Mr. Lousma, 34 percent to 30 percent, among people who said they planned to vote in the primary.However, an undecided category of 36 percent seemed to suggest that neither man had succeeded in arousing great public interest."

That gesture to her womanhood seemed to be one of the few the 36-year- old test pilot was willing to accept. At a news conference and a series of talks with reporters since her return, Miss Savitskaya made it clear she believed women should receive no special treatment in space. Appearing slightly irritated by frequent references to the pleasant atmosphere a woman brings to a space station, she said: ''We do not go into space to improve the mood of the crew. Women go into space because they measure up to the job. They can do it.''"

Jepsen, Republican of Iowa - with his defenses down. ''That works,'' he says. ''The voters have heard about this person, or seen him from a distance, but now they're close. Here's who he really is. Voters are saying, 'Hey, I didn't know him before.' '' Goodman is among the masters of political imagery, one of a handful of high-priced, much-sought-after experts who have spent the last decade remaking the political landscape. Media consultants design and produce all their clients' advertising - print and radio as well as television - and often decide where and when it will appear. They set themes for their candidates, raise funds and mobilize networks of longtime friends and allies to work in the campaigns."

But a dog's life is not always something to be shuddered at, as the current exhibit, through Aug. 31, at the Dog Museum of America, 51 Madison Avenue, at 27th Street (696- 8350), illustrates. ''Pampered Pets'' is more about putting on the dog than about documenting a poor canine condition. It's a cool summer show that testifies to the worship of man's (and woman's) best friend, to the most cloying and sycophantic degree. There is a virtual fashion show of raincoats, galoshes, blue jeans, shirts, mink coats, tuxedo and topper, even an astronaut outfit, all designed for the dog, both today's dog and yesteryear's dog. There are dog collars of gold and of silver studded with gold. You can see pictures of dog grooming and trimming, arts that were developed in the 1600's and gave poodles top-knots and other odd headdresses and body language; dog barbers have been a part of the scene these many centuries."

      "lead_paragraph": "Stepping up his attacks on Walter F. Mondale, President Reagan charged today that the Democratic Presidential nominee's ''knee-jerk'' policies would hurt taxpayers, farmers and consumers and return America to the ''despairing'' days of President Carter. At a ''community forum'' here in the farmlands of central Illinois, Mr. Reagan said Mr. Mondale's support of ''domestic content'' legislation requiring automobiles to have American-made parts would raise the price of cars and ''destroy'' jobs as foreign countries countered with trade barriers on American farm products. He also attacked the former Vice President, as he did Sunday in Missouri, for supporting the curtailment of grain shipments to the Soviet Union in 1980 after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Mr. Mondale, he said, failed to see that the partial embargo punished farmers, not the Russians. ''I guess it's difficult to see the world clearly when you're scrooched down behind American farmers,'' he said."

The panel's oral recommendation to officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to be followed by a written report, came after 10 weeks of debate. The panel members disagreed over whether a permanent moon base should be established to mine oxygen for rocket fuel. The panel was one of several sponsored by the space agency to study the future of space exploration. A second study group, which met in April at Los Alamos, N.M., says it will recommend in October that the United States establish a permanent moon base in the next decade. A NASA group is also studying the feasibility of a moon base."

Perhaps the Republican National Convention should indeed nominate Ronald Reagan to be King of the United States. Mr. Reagan obviously possesses many of the attributes of the modern constitutional monarch. He can play virtually any role, and posing is second nature to him.

It's even been a while since, in the early 70's, changing perceptions of men's and women's societal roles left Hollywood increasingly unable to deal with romantic relationships at all. Hollywood's bewilderment in a period of vigorous social change brought about movies in which the lovers never quite fell in love, or the kinds of working-woman stories in which Jane Fonda (as she did in ''The China Syndrome'') came home alone to a pet turtle and an answering machine. The silence on the subject of sexual relations has been prolonged and uneasy. But it now appears to be drawing to a close."
