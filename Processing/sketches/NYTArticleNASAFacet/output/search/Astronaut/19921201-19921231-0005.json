In a quick private poll I asked 10 residents of the city: \"Who was Girolamo Napoleone?\" None knew. Posthumous fame is fickle. Jerome Napoleon, also known as \"Plon-Plon\" in France, was a nephew of Emperor Napoleon I who married a Savoy princess, and commanded French troops who helped Italy win independence. He died in Rome in 1891 in what was then the elegant Hotel de Russie, 9 Via del Babuino, now the RAI building."

The new work, choreographed by Billy Wilson mostly to music from a Gillespie album that has the same title as the ballet, was apparently done on assignment. Opening the annual Ailey gala benefit on Thursday night, Judith Jamison, the troupe's artistic director, said that \"the Gillespie people approached me about doing a ballet to his music and I said, I have the perfect choreographer.\""
