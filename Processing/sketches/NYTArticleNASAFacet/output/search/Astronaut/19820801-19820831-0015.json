      "lead_paragraph": "Spokesman for Shultz A fter serving only five months as director of the Voice of America, John Hughes has been chosen by Secretary of State George P. Shultz to be his official spokesman at the State Department, replacing Dean Fischer. His new position as Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, which has not been officially announced, will be his third job in the Reagan Administration. Before moving to the Voice, the target of both the left and right over its proper role, Mr. Hughes was associate director of the International Communication Agency. Mr. Hughes, a former editor of The Christian Science Monitor and winner of the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting, is probably happier about his new job than are some members of the Voice of America staff. They said the Hughes move comes at a time when things were beginning to settle down there, and the concern among some is that Mr. Hughes's successor may be more of a political hardliner who favors propaganda over news."

      "lead_paragraph": "ONCE upon a time it was nonobjective vs. representational art, and many a reputation was made (or broken) in the struggle. No rift of comparable magnitude exists today, but there is a crack between neo-representation, which seems as good a term as any for the current figuration deriving from Pop, and representation, which takes its cue from older traditions. The schism is not generational, for though neo-representation is practiced mainly by young artists, the older manner has adherents of all ages, as the summer group show at the Davis and Langdale Gallery, 746 Madison Avenue at 65th Street, testifies. Lennart Anderson, a realist of long standing, presides over the exhibition with a large seated nude and some smaller still lifes, painted and drawn. Lately, Mr. Anderson has lightened his palette, and his nude appears bathed in light that has filtered through dusty windows, reducing tonal contrasts and making this an exercise in tinted grays. Close up, the oil still lifes have a chalky quality, too, even though their components' local colors are bright - red and white tablecloth, green carton, silvery popcorn maker and so on. But at a distance, the high-key colors start to shimmer, making quite beautiful mirages."

But a new group of glamorous spokesmen has taken to the airwaves - key corporate executives. High-powered corporate leaders like Frank Borman of Eastern Airlines, Lee A. Iacocca of Chrysler, David Mahoney of Avis Rent-a-Car and Frank Sellinger of Schlitz Brewing have attempted to combat slumping sales and declining consumer confidence in today's recessionary economy by starring in commercials for their respective companies. The rationale behind these advertising campaigns is simple. Many marketing experts believe that the C.E.O. is a highly credible commercial spokesman, especially in hard times such as these, because he is personally tied to his company's fate. Consumer research studies indicate that the public believes a C.E.O. will deliver on promises of better service or improved quality rather than face the prospect of poor corporate performance and possible dismissal."

If he also happens to be a well-known hero, the first American to orbit the earth, you might think he'd even be the front-runner. But Senator John Glenn, the former astronaut who won re-election in 1980 by that remarkable 1.6 million votes, trails both Edward Kennedy and Walter Mondale in current opinion polls. Don't pay too much attention to that. It's a year and a half until the Democrats start to vote; Senator Kennedy and Mr. Mondale are ahead at this stage mostly because they're familiar faces in national politics, each with a following from earlier battles. As Edward Kennedy learned in 1980, that kind of lead doesn't necessarily hold up when the polls open."

So it was that Senator John Glenn, flanked by four aides and looking as wholesome as a box of Wheaties, appeared this morning at one of those ''working'' Washington breakfasts to try out on a group of political reporters the rough outlines, and a few specifics, of his campaign platform, should he decide to run. But by the time the Ohio Democrat's eggs and bacon had gotten cold, he had somehow managed to embroil himself in one of the nation's hottest political controversies. At the breakfast's end, almost as an afterthought, Mr. Glenn said that the nation ought to consider instituting a voluntary alternative to the Social Security system for younger people. Such a ''quasi-private'' alternative for people in their ''younger years,'' he added, could help ''wean ourselves away from'' the current system."

The commander of the spacecraft is Lieut. Col. Leonid I. Popov of the Air Force, 36, who completed a record-setting 185-day space flight on Oct. 11, 1980, with another Soviet astronaut, Valery V. Ryumin. The third member of the crew was identified as Alexander Serebrov, 38, a rookie astronaut serving as the flight engineer."

Then, in 1958, Captain Rickenbacker made a critical error. He dragged his feet at entering the jet age and relinquished delivery on six DC-8's, which Delta quickly snapped up. Captain Rickenbacker sniffed at the early jets that he considered underpowered. But the public clamored for the jets, which cost less to fly than Eastern's propeller planes, and when Eastern began to make jet purchases, it had to stand behind other airlines that had already placed their orders. As a result, Eastern became the technological laggard of the industry for nearly two decades."

Ride, chosen to be the United States' first female astronaut, is to be launched as a mission specialist on the space shuttle. However, Miss Savitskaya's flight with two male companions has also served to underline the ambiguities in Soviet attitudes toward women, which combine a vaunting pride in the advancement of women with a degree of sentimentality and deference that would jar many Western feminists."
