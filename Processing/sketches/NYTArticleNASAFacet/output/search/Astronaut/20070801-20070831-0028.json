In the 14-year history of the Professional Bull Riders tour, no one has done a better job of that than Adriano Moraes, who first rode a calf as a child in Brazil. Moraes, 37, is the oldest and most decorated member of the circuit, winner of an unprecedented three world championships, in 1994, 2001 and 2006. How has the old man -- on perhaps his last lap around the circuit -- managed to succeed, let alone survive, in this young man's sport? SITTING PRETTY"

In the end, NASA handled the problem deftly, and the shuttle landed safely at the Kennedy Space Center yesterday. But it was a troubling reminder that the aging shuttles have some inherent defects that will always pose a risk as they limp toward retirement in 2010. Under the shattering forces of liftoff, a small piece of foam, weighing about one-third of an ounce, fell from the Endeavor's external fuel tank, bounced off a strut and hit the underside of the orbiter, where it gouged a small hole in the protective heat tiles. The hole was deep enough in one area to penetrate the entire thickness of the tiles. This was worrisome because the shuttle Columbia was destroyed in 2003 when a much bigger piece of foam fell off and gouged a hole in its wing, allowing hot gases to penetrate the vehicle during re-entry."
