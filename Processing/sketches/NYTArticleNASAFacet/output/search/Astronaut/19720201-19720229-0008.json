      "abstract": "1st satellite in long-delayed EROS program to be launched in May; known as ERTS-A, for Earth Resources Technology Satellite, will be 1,800-lb vehicle that will carry electronic remote sensing devices and high-resolution TV cameras to locate earth's natural resources; together with ERTS-B, which will be launched in '73, will develop a land and agr map of US, classify geologic and soil features and develop techniques for processing huge amts of earth data; specialists in remote electronic sensing who attended recent Cong conf on earth resources voiced criticism with pace and mgt of EROS program; contend that mgt has been divided among Interior, Agr and Commerce Depts and NASA, and that Defense Dept, which has spent large amts on mil sensors, has been uncooperative toward program; ex-Interior Sec S L Udall blames footdragging by NASA for program delay; says he tried as early as '65 to get NASA interested; says he proposed that Interior Dept would put up $2-million for program if NASA would put up $5-million but NASA refused; Udall's contention backed by series of lrs made public by HR Com on Science and Astronautics in '68 which indicated NASA officials were lukewarm toward program; one of current disputes involving EROS concerns Air Force refusal, apparently for security reasons, to allow use of new high-resolution camera; Repr Winn, member of HR Science Com, says EROS has been a stepchild of Apollo program and Govt agencies involved are still jealous of each other",
