      "lead_paragraph": "Say what you will about Stanley Kubrick, but he never made a forgettable movie. The Museum of the Moving Image is screening all 12 of his feature films in this five-week series, plus Max Ophuls's 1950 Vienna romance ''La Ronde,'' based on the same Arthur Schnitzler novel as Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' and the robot-boy fairy tale ''A. I.: Artificial Intelligence'' (2001), which Kubrick began before his death in 1999 and Steven Spielberg finished. After an introductory lecture by the museum's chief curator, David Schwartz, the retrospective fun begins tomorrow with a restored 70-millimeter print of ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the 1968 science fiction classic that defined psychedelia, starring Keir Dullea, above, as an interplanetary astronaut with a mutinous computer. It will be followed by the lesser-known ''Killer's Kiss,'' an indie-style film about a boxer, and ''The Killing,'' a heist flick, both made in the mid-1950's. Then the leading men start rolling along, among them Kirk Douglas fighting World War I in ''Paths of Glory'' and leading a Roman slave rebellion in ''Spartacus,'' James Mason romancing a junior high school girl in ''Lolita,'' Ryan O'Neal social-climbing in a powdered wig in ''Barry Lyndon,'' Jack Nicholson haunting an empty hotel in ''The Shining,'' a futuristic Malcolm McDowell learning that crime doesn't pay in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' Peter Sellers going nuclear in ''Dr. Strangelove'' and the omnipresent Tom Cruise partying with the rich and debauched in ''Eyes Wide Shut.'' Matthew Modine, who starred in the Vietnam War drama ''Full Metal Jacket''; Chris Chase, the leading lady of ''Killer's Kiss''; and Vincent Lobrutto, a Kubrick biographer, will make personal appearances.
