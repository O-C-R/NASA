Avid fans of science fiction, no matter what planet they call home, are all too familiar with the cycle of excitement, confusion and despair that seems to occur whenever a new science fiction series begins. First there's the promise of an intriguing, risk-taking show. The viewers quickly become puzzled when the fledgling series, having failed to gain a mass audience, is shuttled through various time slots, pre-empted, postponed or tossed into the black hole known as ''permanent hiatus.''"
