The maneuver was seen by American experts as a prelude to operations aboard the Salyut space station involving larger crews than before that would probably attempt to set new flight endurance records. A crew of perhaps three astronauts could be sent to the newly enlarged space station in the next few weeks in a Soyuz spacecraft."

First, he realized that the woman selected to be the first female astronaut, scheduled to go aloft in the next United States space trip, was Mary Cleave, a student of his in the early 60's. Next he learned that Miss Cleave named him as one of the teachers who had most influenced her. Then he was told that Dave Marash of WNBC-TV News, while talking to the most recently selected astronauts, had been struck by the fact that each was a product of a highly rated public high school. They were Stuyvesant in Manhattan, Scarsdale in Westchester County and Great Neck High Schools. ''I told Dave Marash,'' Mr. Love said, ''that I remember Miss Cleave as a very hard-working young lady at a time when not many girls took physics. Don't forget, we not only didn't have computers then, we didn't even have calculators.''"

The voting March 29 will match Steve Hogan, the 34-year-old Democrat who was soundly defeated by Mr. Swigert last fall, against State Senator Daniel L. Schaefer, the Republican choice. Mr. Schaefer, whose campaign so far has raised nearly four times as much money as his opponent's, is regarded as the favorite to win in a suburban district in which Republicans outnumber Democrats."
