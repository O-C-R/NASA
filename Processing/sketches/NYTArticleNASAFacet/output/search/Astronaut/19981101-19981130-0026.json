      "lead_paragraph": "THE European Space Agency labored in obscurity for many years, achieving dozens of feats in the heavens that were ignored by most Europeans. Then, in 1983, Europe's first astronaut soared into space aboard a shuttle. Suddenly, millions of television viewers across the continent were glued to their sets, watching a good-looking European explorer risk life and limb on the high frontier. Officials at the agency's headquarters in Paris were ecstatic. Eager for more, they quickly got the same religion as their counterparts in America, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which long ago had mastered the art of promoting space-age heroism. Belatedly, the Europeans discovered that public enthusiasm for sending people into space, a venture steeped in risk and danger, drama and the right stuff, was a sure way to win political support for space exploration and its great costs."

The death in 1997 of Mike Royko of The Chicago Tribune and the recent disgrace of Mike Barnicle of The Boston Globe -- who made his final farewell on The Globe's Op-Ed page last week -- created an almost Pavlovian response, sending journalists scurrying back to the collected works of New York's Damon Runyon or Baltimore's H. L. Mencken. The urge is to say that urban columnists aren't as important as they used to be. Clearly, the big names that resonate around the country are fewer. Those who mourn bygone days and columnists, however, are missing the point. What has changed is not so much the urban column but the way the city and the world have changed around it."

A moderate, she did not seek re-election in 1996, mostly because she worried about campaigning in the heat of an Arkansas summer while she was pregnant with twins. While in Congress, she favored Federal money for abortion, the balanced-budget amendment and the North American Free Trade Agreement. She supports charter schools but says vouchers might dilute the resources of public schools."
