This is the premise of Pixar's newest brightly colored, computer-animated feature, ''Monsters, Inc.'' Pixar Animation Studios has now so streamlined the process that you may find yourself eagerly awaiting the release of ''Monsters'' on video so you can take in all the myriad visual jokes planted all over the frame, a form of visual invention that adds an extra tickle to the picture. Not that ''Monsters'' needs it; in a final reversal of events, Pixar has given Disney, which financed the film, the last leg up by stealing the style and speed of Warner Brothers cartoons, which used to ridicule Disney's do-gooder ethos."

'' Everything about its pictures -- the text was beyond him for the moment -- seemed both wondrous and reasonable to my fellow youth-culturist, whose voice had caught my attention from four aisles away. ''Yes,'' he was saying, ''right,'' he said, ''a space station, right, of course, they'll have a space station, they'll have a space station by 2001.'' His tone was admirably calm for someone who was raving. I thought of this matter-of-fact prophet only recently, because now that it's 2001, we do have an International Space Station, and few people seem to care. In April, the station's crew coped with a critical computer breakdown -- the sort of danger that Stanley Kubrick and his co-author, Arthur C. Clarke, had predicted in ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' -- and did so without distracting America from the start of the baseball season. In July, the mission team installed an elaborate new air lock, and again the public yawned, although not even ''2001'' had foreseen that such orbital tinkering might be performed by a Col. Susan J. Helms."
