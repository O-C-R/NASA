The huge $60 billion engineering project has been delayed repeatedly, and when the astronauts were finally sent aloft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the venture got limited attention in an America absorbed in its closest presidential race in years. Even so, if all goes well in coming years, this could mark the start for Americans of continuous operations in space as opposed to intermittent shuttle trips. This page has been lukewarm about the station from the beginning, feeling that it would be enormously costly and yield only limited scientific returns, most of which could be gained by satellites and unmanned probes to the solar system. Many of the claims advanced for the station -- such as the opportunity it provides to grow perfect crystals in the absence of gravity and to perform other exquisite manufacturing tasks -- have been hyped beyond reason and debunked by expert committees. But that does not mean there is no value at all in the enterprise. The fact that 16 nations are collaborating on the American-led project is a diplomatic achievement, as is the participation of Russian space and rocket scientists who might otherwise be tempted to put their skills to malevolent use. Once the station is fully assembled and running, scientists may learn more about how astronauts react, physically and mentally, to extended periods in space. The astronauts will master the skills for assembling big structures in space."

      "lead_paragraph": "PHOTOGRAPHY is at a peculiar juncture right now. It crowds the walls of museums and commercial galleries with images that pointedly question its powers -- a medium flaunting its disillusionments. Traditional silver-based still images stand by helplessly as digitization and video claim a piece of their territory, a conquest that seems only to heighten interest in both winners and losers. For several years, as this ferment has intensified, the International Center of Photography, New York's only photography museum, has slipped out of the center of attention. Its exhibition program, with some notable exceptions, has been stodgy, and the excitement has landed elsewhere."

      "lead_paragraph": "SO much for the end of the year as the season of serious films for grown-ups. As the holidays approach, escapism is running rampant. Moviegoers can find Terence Stamp rocketing to Mars, Christine Baranski hanging out in Whoville and Jeremy Irons battling evil in a fantasy empire. Actual distant lands are popular, too, with an unusual number of films from Asia. And most of the children's films are set on other continents. Even close to home, the world seems to be awash in vampires, werewolves, seemingly normal humans with supernatural powers and young people close to the Devil. At least most of the documentaries are serious. And in the midst of it all, there are love stories, war dramas and portraits of artists as violently talented men. Opening dates, as always, are subject to change. November ''SUZHOU RIVER'' From mainland China, a modernist film noir about a videomaker's attraction to two women (played ''Vertigo'' style by the same actress). One is an exotic dancer; the other is a teenager in love with a motorcycle messenger. Lou Ye is the director. Zhou Xun and Jia Hongsheng star. Opens Wednesday. ''ANGEL'S LADIES'' A documentary about Angel and Mack Moore, an Oregon couple who retired to Nevada to run a legal brothel. And are darned proud of it. Directed by Doug Lindeman, who has produced films about the pornographic film industry and lesbian bars. Friday. ''LOOKING FOR AN ECHO'' Where are the doo-wop stars of yesteryear? Armand Assante plays one, now 50, widowed and tending bar in Brooklyn. Then he meets a woman (Diane Venora) and all sorts of feelings, including his love for music, spring back to life. Directed by Martin Davidson (''The Lords of Flatbush''). Friday. ''ME AND ISAAC NEWTON'' The newest documentary from Michael Apted, who did the acclaimed ''Seven-Up'' series of films. Noted scientists talk about their specialties including robots, lemurs and a unified theory of everything. Friday. ''MEN OF HONOR'' The first black Navy SEAL and the racist senior officer who hates him, at first. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Robert De Niro star. Directed by George Tillman Jr., who wrote and directed ''Soul Food.'' Friday. ''NONSTOP'' A comic chase movie featuring a bank robber, a convenience store clerk and a mobster racing through the streets of Tokyo. Written and directed by Sabu (a k a Hiroyuki Tanaka). Friday. ''REBELS WITH A CAUSE'' Remembering S.D.S., the college organization that put the radical politics in the 60's. A documentary by Helen Garvy, who helped found Students for a Democratic Society's Harvard chapter in 1962. Friday. ''RED PLANET'' Val Kilmer does sci-fi. He plays a member of the American astronaut team on the first manned flight to Mars. Everyone's a little stressed, because Earth is on its last legs and a Martian colony is their only hope, so there are a few emotional flare-ups. With Benjamin Bratt, Terence Stamp and Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Anthony Hoffman. Friday. ''YOU CAN COUNT ON ME'' She's a respectable churchgoing single mom. He's an irresponsible drifter. They're sister and brother, reunited in their childhood home and having unexpected effects on each other. Their story, starring Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo, won two major prizes at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Written and directed by the playwright Kenneth Lonergan. Friday. ''BOUNCE'' Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck together again. He's a hip L.A. ad man who gives away his airline seat on a flight that crashes, then falls in love with the widow of the man who took his place. Shades of Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas's ''Random Hearts.'' This one is written and directed by Don Roos, who did the terrific ''Opposite of Sex.'' Nov. 17. ''DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS'' If you're going to bring the grouchy green Grinch to life, Jim Carrey is probably your best bet, even if he's unrecognizable in fur. The Grinch, as every child knows, is determined to keep the residents of Whoville from celebrating their favorite holiday. Ron Howard directed. Christine Baranski, Molly Shannon and Bill Irwin play Whos. Nov. 17. A related article is on Page 9.

Two handsome young wolves (James Layton and Lee Williams) are framed for murder, and the whole village (including the local priest, who's a little wolfish himself) turns against them.

Brian Skeet wrote and directed. Nov. 22. December ''A GOOD BABY'' One critic called it ''Flannery O'Connor meets Krzysztof Kieslowski.'' Henry Thomas plays a reclusive young North Carolina man who finds an abandoned baby in the woods and goes searching for its mother. Directed by Katherine Dieckmann, making her feature film debut.

Dec. 1. ''FINDING FORRESTER'' A male mentor picture from Gus Van Sant. Sean Connery is a reclusive novelist; Rob Brown, a newcomer, is a young basketball star who, it turns out, is also a brilliant writer. Is that the theme music to ''Good Will Hunting'' we hear?

''TERRORISTS IN RETIREMENT'' Simone Signoret narrated this 1984 documentary a year before she died. It's the story of Jewish immigrants in Nazi-occupied Paris, taking the most dangerous assignments in the Resistance. The surviving fighters, elderly men now, are interviewed, and what they say doesn't always reflect well on the official Resistance. Maybe that's why it was originally banned from French television.

On his plate, there wasn't much left of his mesclun greens and goat cheese salad. But judging from how much he was laughing, Mr. Hanks was enjoying more than just his meal. He was there to present Ms. Hunter, an old friend, with a special career achievement award at Premiere magazine's ''Women in Hollywood'' luncheon, an annual event known for its high giddiness factor. So while Mr. Hanks heaped praise on Ms. Hunter, he also laced his podium time with teasing ad-libs and did a clipped, weirdly high-pitched imitation of Ms. Hunter's husband, the Polish cinematographer Janusz Kaminski."

''Oh, by the way, I'm told I've been nominated for the presidency of Harvard.'' For hundreds of deans, department heads and miscellaneous leading figures around the country, just such an ego-feeding delicacy is legitimately theirs these days. Harvard University is seeking to replace its departing president, Neil L. Rudenstine, by next summer, and the net it is casting is so wide -- and, at this early stage, so uncharacteristically undiscriminating -- that it has received about 500 nominations. (Not so many, really, considering that it sent more than 300,000 letters asking for suggestions.)"

Entertaining and unexpectedly thought-provoking, the exhibition presents more than 200 toy robots, rocket ships, flying saucers, astronauts and space stations produced mostly by Japanese manufacturers for the American market after World War II. Devoted mainly to robots, the collection is said to be one of the largest of its kind in the world. It was assembled by Robert Lesser, a Manhattan resident, over the last two decades. A few people might ask, however, why is this sort of low-end commercial juvenilia being showcased at a museum of fine art? One answer is that it belongs to the history of modern design. Displayed in vitrines like ancient artifacts or crowded onto shelves in bright red and yellow wall cases like merchandise in a toy store, the objects on view do relate to 20th-century design in general as they evolve through a series of stylistic periods: the Machine Age, the Atomic Age, the Space Age and the Age of Real Space Exploration. At that point, in the early 1970's, children's interests shifted elsewhere, and the robot and space toy industry collapsed."

      "lead_paragraph": "BUG-EYED and colorfully dressed like atomic-age samurai, Japanese tin toy robots mesmerized American children in the 1950's and 60's. The robots moved like tanks, beaming light, breathing fire and wobbling to a halt as their batteries died. When the robots were new, they were made from recycled tin cans left in Japan by G.I.'s during the American occupation. Children fantasized that these warrior machines were destined to conquer Earth and outer space, but not with guns for the most part. Instead they were armed with what seemed like the latest in electronic gadgetry -- radio antennas, telephones, cameras and television sets -- and as such they were harbingers of the technology revolution. These pop-culture toys helped sell Japanese electronics to the world."

Dr. Chang-Diaz, who was in Costa Rica to foster greater Latin American participation in space projects, had just met some Chilean scientists who were trying to cure Chagas' disease, a parasitic illness that kills about 45,000 people a year, mostly in Latin America.
