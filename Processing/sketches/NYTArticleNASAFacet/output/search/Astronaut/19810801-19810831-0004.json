Lynn Helms asserted that the agency ''will, at my direction, stay out of the press as much as possible.'' But if freedom to practice his quiet brand of behind-the-scenes management was a major goal, then the slim, 56-year-old former Marine Corps test pilot chose the wrong government job. Avowedly ''nonpolitical'' and publicity-shy, he finds himself at center stage in the air traffic controller's strike, which has developed into a major test for the new Administration. To this task, associates said, he brings a decisive style - cool, analytical, heavily dependent on facts and detailed knowledge - that helped him gain a reputation as an executive who could help save ailing companies. He came to his job as head of the aviation agency after six years as head of the Piper Aircraft Company, which he brought out of a financial tailspin."
