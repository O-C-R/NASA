      "lead_paragraph": "Early in November, Charles Conrad, the former astronaut, returned triumphantly to this Middle Western aviation center from a monthlong worldwide trip to sell the DC-9 Super 80, McDonnell Douglas's latest airliner. ''We met our objective,'' said Mr. Conrad, the company's senior marketing vice president for commercial aircraft. He was referring to the selling effort on behalf of the Super 80 -an effort that involved unusual financing arrangements - that could represent McDonnell's last chance to stay competitive in the risky business of manufacturing commercial jets. As a result of the recent orders for the two-year-old derivative of earlier DC-9's, it looks like McDonnell, which also builds fighter aircraft and missiles, will remain in the commercial airline business for a while longer. Shortly after Mr. Conrad's return, Alitalia announced plans to purchase 30 Super 80's for about $600 million, the biggest award ever received by McDonnell Douglas. Mr. Conrad, however, saw equally important gains that have yet to be realized. ''We showed the Super 80 to as many people in as many parts of the world as we could in a relatively short time.''"

WHEN ''The Twilight Zone'' made its network television debut on Oct. 2, 1959, the generation that has since danced to a disco version of the show's theme song was young, impressionable and ready for a good scare. Children quickly became the biggest fans of Rod Serling's electronic-age campfire tales, perhaps because children had the requisite gullibility, simplicity, love of heavy irony and tolerance for repetition. Whatever the reasons, ''The Twilight Zone'' became an unforgettably spooky experience for anyone who tuned in, which is why a book like Marc Scott Zicree's ''The Twilight Zone Companion'' seems a good idea. Even now, watching ''Twilight Zone'' reruns with any sort of companion is a better idea than watching them alone."

Mr. Nakasone, expressing sympathy for the effects of superior Japanese technology on the depressed American steel and auto industries, said Japan was reducing its trade and tariff barriers faster than any nation in the world. Describing a ''shower'' of protest at the White House and a ''storm'' of complaints on Capitol Hill, the Prime Minister cautioned the United States against taking protectionist countermeasures. ''I suggest that more positive, constructive efforts like encouraging Japanese industries to locate in the United States would be much wiser,'' Mr. Nakasone said at a news conference."

The Democratic State Convention was the first of this year's political cattle shows, one from which former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and Senators Alan Cranston and Dale Bumpers emerged with their chances a little enhanced. But Presidential politics at this stage is incremental, and nothing decisive emerged from the meeting except proof that the Democrats' proclaimed efforts to shorten the Presidential campaign had failed. Before spring there may be eight announcments. But the first such scheduled, by Mr. Cranston on Feb. 2, will set no records for an early proclamation of ambition. Representative Philip M. Crane of Illinois opened his bid for the 1980 Republican nomination in August 1978, and before Christmas of 1974 both Jimmy Carter and Morris K. Udall had said they were candidates for 1976."
