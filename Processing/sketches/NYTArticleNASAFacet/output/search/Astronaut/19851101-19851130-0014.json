According to one of the recipients, Mr. Reagan said in his letter: ''It has become clear that the board has grown to a size which makes it difficult to focus intimately and actively on some of the new critical intelligence problems we will have to address. I intend therefore to reconstitute and streamline the board.''"

West Germany chartered the shuttle, paying the National Aeronautics and Space Administration a $65 million fee, and controlled the flight's scientific operations. Mission Control here directed the other operations."

Nearby, Prof. Peter Sahm, the project's scientific director, explains to a casual news conference that a slime culture is growing more slowly than expected 200 miles aloft. In a converted airplane hangar, Col. Gordon Fullerton, a United States astronaut and the commander of a previous German-American mission, tells visiting schoolchildren what it is like to be weightless, and Marcus Buchwald, a 19-year-old high school student, shows the tiny wheat plants he grew from grain exposed to cosmic rays on that earlier German flight."

Do you know of any group or club exclusively for those who have traveled completely around the world? -B. T. P., New York Answer:The Circumnavigators Club, which was founded by two Americans in 1902, is an international organization devoted to bringing together travelers who have circled the globe. Helen Jost, executive secretary of its international headquarters in New York, says there are 10 chapters in other parts of the United States and 5 overseas. The total of more than 1,000 members includes those who belong to the international headquarters, which holds six to eight luncheon or dinner meetings a year. The guest of honor at the next meeting, a dinner at the Union League Club in New York on Thursday, will be the astronaut Sally Ride. She will be presented with the club's Order of Magellan, which is awarded to global travelers who have made a contribution to international understanding. Mrs. Jost said prospective members must submit evidence that they have traveled around the world and must be sponsored and seconded by members, who submit recommendations to the board. Must the trip have been made in one continuous journey? ''No, it can be done in parts, provided travelers pick up where they left off,'' Mrs. Jost said. ''But the circumnavigation must be in one direction.''"

CBS Theaterical Films and ABC Motion Pictures, founded with high hopes in 1979, have been closed and padlocked, and Hollywood is neither surprised nor particularly disturbed. ''There were too many pictures in the marketplace last summer, 45, and, in that sense, losing some output is good,'' said Richard Zanuck, one of Hollywood's foremost independent producers. The latest CBS movie, ''Target,'' was produced by Zanuck-Brown. Starring Gene Hackman and directed by Arthur Penn, it opened last weekend to moderately good box-office response. Mr. Zanuck, who was in charge of production at 20th Century-Fox from 1962 to 1970, said, ''To stay in the movie business, you have to have a thick skin and you only get that by surviving many blows. This is a business of ups and downs and the major studios are mentally prepared for the hard knocks. The networks had their film divisions as appendages. So they were always in a secondary position.'' CBS announced its decision to abandon the movie business Wednesday; ABC closed its film operations Oct. 29."

My hosts had just finished serving a sumptuous Sunday dinner, and some of us were quite content to flop on the porch swing and enjoy the fall colors on the opposite ridge. The younger generation had another idea for the last hour before the sun dropped behind the mountain: a touch football game. They produced a ball and draped extra T-shirts to create sideline markers on the sloping front lawn, and then they recruited the sluggards on the front porch. I was a late-round draft choice."

The Mayor, however, cautioned officials of his Commission for Science and Technology that ''I cannot black out the city.'' But he said that, among other possibilities, decorative lighting on building facades and bridges and large outdoor advertising displays might be switched off or dimmed during certain periods sometime between Dec. 1 and Jan. 15, when the comet is expected to be most visible from the New York area. The dimming of lights would presumably be done voluntarily by private owners of buildings at the Mayor's request. A Major Preoccupation With comet-watching becoming a preoccupation, momentum had been building for plans to dim city lights."

As Maj. Jerry L. Ross and Lieut. Col. Sherwood C. Spring floated weightless from one task to another, they worked so efficiently and quickly that there was ample time for banter and for admiring the view of the Earth as it wheeled overhead. The trouble-free space construction exercise capped a mission that has been flawless since the Atlantis lifted off its pad at the Kennedy Space Center Tuesday night. Instruments monitoring the astronauts' heartbeats and rates of oxygen consumption indicated two hours into the exercise that the heavy exertion was tiring them somewhat, but they continued to complete their assignments ahead of schedule."
