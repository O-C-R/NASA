The Italian-made satellite and its American-made tether to the shuttle generated electricity for several hours last Sunday, and delivered that electricity to the shuttle, as they swept through Earth's magnetic field. But the experiment soon went awry, as the cable snapped even before being extended from the shuttle to its full length of nearly 13 miles. The satellite, with 12 miles of cable attached, has been floating free ever since."

Plans now call for the heliport to be built a half-mile south, on the site of the city's towed-car pound opposite the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, and to be run by the museum. The Guadalcanal will remain berthed in the Delaware River, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard."

Shortly after the Soviet success, President Kennedy, under enormous pressure to outdo the Communists, announced a bold plan to land Americans on the Moon by the end of the decade. But it turns out that Lieutenant Gagarin's flight aboard Vostok 1 was far from the seamless triumph that Moscow publicized for so many decades. In fact, man's first voyage beyond the planet was nearly a disaster, Western aerospace experts have learned."

But a leaky power unit in the shuttle's steering system raised concerns that the mission might not be able to run its full nine days. Space agency officials emphasized that the malfunction was not life-threatening. Only one of the three identical hydraulic systems, which are used to control wing flaps, the rudder and landing gear, is malfunctioning. The leak, moreover, has apparently been halted at least for the time being, but could recur when the system is switched back on for the shuttle's descent and landing."
