      "lead_paragraph": "RUVEN AFANADOR As the photographer Ruven Afanador knows, taking someone's photograph is an act of intimacy. ''Somehow it's like a dance,'' he says. ''The person usually manages to arrive at the place where I'm pleased with it.'' His photographs of five grandes dames of Italian design (Page 150) are as playful and tough as the women themselves. Similar qualities can be found in his fashion photography (far left) and in his two books of tender portraits of powerful men: ''Sombra'' (Merrell) features classical dancers, while ''Torero'' (Edition Stemmle, above) is about bullfighters. So does the photographer have any desire to get up close and personal with a bull himself? ''No,'' he says with a laugh. More of Afanador's work is on view in the exhibit ''Seven'' at Forma in Milan."

With dazed exuberance he watches it recede into deep blue sky, and then, with the release of parachutes, gently drift four miles away, preserved for another flight."
