Considering that only several hundred of those CD's even make the Top 40, that leaves thousands upon thousands of CD's that few people ever hear. Thus, every year, the pop music critics at The New York Times compile a list of the CD's that almost got away the previous year. The choices here include CD's on small independent labels; groups whose music has never been released domestically; acts who work in genres that are far too experimental or avant-garde for mainstream radio; older legends making a comeback; and younger musicians with the potential to become legends."

It's tough to argue with a child who wants to increase his knowledge of camera angles and special effects, and who has already read the screenplay.) Because technology moves as fast as it does, Evan even has a head start on The Man himself. When Mr. Spielberg was 11, all he had to work with was a Super 8 camera; his editing method was to film in sequence. Evan is equipped with a borrowed Canon ZR50MC digital camcorder and the iMovie 2 film-editing software that came with our iMac computer."

Deep Blue not only beat Mr. Kasparov on the chessboard in that go-round; it also wounded him psychologically, provoked him into blunders and reduced him to tantrums afterward. Since then, Deep Blue has retired from chess while Mr. Kasparov has been dethroned as world champion (human division) by his protégé, Vladimir Kramnik, who upset him in head-to-head competition in 2000. Mr. Kramnik, known as ''Mr. Iceberg'' for his coolness under pressure, took his own turn last year against a German-Dutch computer program known as Deep Fritz, which beat out other top computer programs to qualify. Mr. Kramnik, who was helped by rules designed to circumscribe the computer's awesome powers, jumped to a quick lead in the series but then began to melt. He was lucky to escape with a tie."
