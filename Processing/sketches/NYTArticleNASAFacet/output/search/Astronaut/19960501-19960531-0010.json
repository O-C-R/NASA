The twins, 32, are both Navy lieutenants and fighter pilots at the Naval Air Station at Patuxent River, Md. More than 2,400 people applied for the astronaut class of 1996, and 35 were selected. Ten of them, including the Kelly twins, were chosen to be shuttle pilot candidates. The rest will be mission specialists."

One motive is fame, for it is the nature of man to journey where there is great danger, and thus win honor and praise. A second motive is curiosity, for it is also man's nature to see the things he has heard about, and thus learn whether they are as he has been told or not. The third is the desire for gain, for men seek wealth wherever they have heard that gain is to be gotten. -- FROM \"THE KING'S MIRROR,\" A 13TH-CENTURY NORSE TREATISE WHEN HUMANS FINALLY ACQUIRED the technology to travel to another planet, it occurred to them that they didn't really want to go. A manned mission to Mars, the fantasy that had paid the mortgage for generations of science-fiction writers, lost its appeal as soon as NASA plotted the itinerary. The $400 billion price tag seemed absurdly high to a nation bored with the sight of astronauts lumbering around craters. We already had enough extraterrestrial rocks, thank you. Recently, though, an intriguing modification to NASA's Mars plan has been suggested: ditch NASA. Let private explorers, modern Vikings inspired by the Norsemen's third desire, seek wealth on Mars. The basics of the expedition have been worked out by Robert M. Zubrin, who has his own research and development company, Pioneer Astronautics, in Denver. Since devising the technology for a simple and cheap mission to Mars, Zubrin has been traveling the globe giving passionate lectures about \"our generation's New World.\" He tells audiences of the prizes offered by 15th-century Portuguese and Spanish rulers to entrepreneurs for venturing down the African coast and across the Atlantic. (Columbus's expedition was financed not only by Queen Isabella but also by private merchants who stood to gain trading concessions.) Zubrin thinks that if the United States Government were to offer a Mars Prize of $20 billion -- four times what he estimates a private mission would cost -- entrepreneurs would take the bait. If they made it to Mars and back, pocketing the prize, they could turn a nice profit; if they failed, taxpayers wouldn't be stuck with the bill."
