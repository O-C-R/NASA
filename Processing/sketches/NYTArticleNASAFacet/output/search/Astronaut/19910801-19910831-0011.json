A Defense Department official said the study was a responsible way to explore how to modernize the nation's land-based missiles, many of which will be retired early next century. Moreover, some private experts said the merit of investigating new kinds of armaments had been driven home by the sudden ouster of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his replacement by Communist hard-liners."
