By Loren Partridge. (Perspectives/Abrams, paper, $16.95.) A conspicuous novelty in the art book business is what might be called the mega-magazine. This is the book, large or small, in which the traditional primacy of text over image is loosened, broken up and turned inside out. The picture researcher is now the impresario, with material that is as exuberant as it is diverse. Layout and image lead the dance. The text, though tightly written and not scanted, does not run on. There are maps, plans, engravings, photographs, illustrations, family trees and chronologies to vary the menu. Thumbnail biographical dictionaries chase away the chore of remembering who is who."

New research on how people react to long spans of weightlessness is driving home a range of health risks, especially ones that affect the body upon return to gravity's pull. Muscles, heart function, blood flow, red blood cell production and the immune system are usually weakened when astronauts first step back onto the Earth's surface."

One of those issues concerns guard Lance Smith, who is involved in intense and sensitive discussions with the Giants involving his contract. The Giants and Smith's agent, Peter Schaffer, have been discussing Smith's situation for more than a month. It stems from a move the team made this past off season when it asked Smith to take a pay cut of about $1 million, from $1.1 million to $350,000. Then, Smith was replaced in the starting lineup by Rob Zatechka. As usual with Smith, he handled both things with class and did not once publicly complain, although being asked to take a pay cut and being benched was surely not pleasant for him."

Debra Winger's Emma, available only in snapshots and glowing references, is invoked over and over in a film that has few better ways to spend its time. ''The Evening Star'' wobbles along for well over two hours and still seems uneventful, since it does little more than watch Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) cope pluckily with her grandmotherly problems. Aurora, the Dolly Levi of suburban Houston, still has a big retinue of friends, servants and admirers. She also has the three grown children whom Emma left behind, and shepherding them provides many opportunities for cracker-barrel wisdom. For instance: ''I have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a mistake. I think we all create what we need.'' And, ''When you stop trying, you fade away.''"
