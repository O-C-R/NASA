As for the instrument, a Soloette Travel Guitar, she said he was walking in a park in Houston when he noticed someone playing one and \"decided that was the perfect gift.\""

The computer-animated \"Toy Story,\" a parent-tickling delight, is a work of incredible cleverness in the best two-tiered Disney tradition. Children will enjoy a new take on the irresistible idea of toys coming to life. Adults will marvel at a witty script and utterly brilliant anthropomorphism. And maybe no one will even mind what is bound to be a mind-boggling marketing blitz. After all, the toy tie-ins are to old friends. It's a lovely joke that the film's toy characters are charmingly plain (Etch-a-Sketch, plastic soldiers, a dog made out of a Slinky) while its behind-the-scenes technology, under the inspired direction of John Lasseter, could not be more cutting edge. It's another joke that this film begins with human characters who have the flat, inexpressive look of toys. A boy named Andy is seen playing boisterously with Woody, his favorite cowboy, whose features remain innocently blank. Only after Andy gets bored and goes elsewhere does Woody spring magically to life."

The film, whatever justice it does to the Michael Crichton novel on which it's based, focuses on jungle mystery and ends in a wild, high-tech donnybrook between the scientists, lasers ablaze, and a horde of killer gorillas. Sound like the makings of a video game? On Dec. 11, Viacom New Media, a division of the same company that owns Paramount, is to release the CD-ROM \"Congo: The Movie -- Descent Into Zinj.\" Yes, it's a game, but peace is at hand. \"It's not combat,\" said Michele DiLorenzo, Viacom New Media's president. \"It's a narrative game in which a protagonist moves toward a goal by solving a succession of puzzles.\""
