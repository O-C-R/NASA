      "lead_paragraph": "Ever since World War I, avant-gardists have tended to dismiss opera with impatience. Opera seemed creatively extinct, appealing to a comfortably bourgeois audience that neither knew nor wanted to know of the radical innovations that were transforming the other arts. There were exceptions to this generalization, of course, both in the composition of an occasional important new opera and some strikingly original productions of the classics. But, for the most part, the avant-garde expressed itself in painting, theater, performance art, dance, even rock-and-roll more readily than in dear, dead old opera. By and large, opera buffs couldn't have cared less. They grew to like things the way they were, happily savoring new singers as they came along, comparing performances, and having what they already knew confirmed, year in and year out. Now, the avant-garde and the opera would appear to have taken a renewed interest in each other. There is danger in such a sudden revitalization, however. The avant-gardists, lacking a sense of opera's traditions and essence, may carelessly destroy it in the pursuit of novelties. But there is hope, too, that opera can finally begin to catch up with the other arts - that it may become more contemporary and, perhaps, that the weight and majesty of its conventions can help create a new, vital and popular kind of contemporary performing art."

Three years in the making, ''Life on Earth'' was completed in 1978 and quickly went on to capture large audiences, enthusiastic reviews and assorted awards for the British Broadcasting Corporation. The author and narrator is David Attenborough, naturalist, historian, zoologist, anthropologist and, after a decade as host of a program called ''Zoo Quest,'' former director of programs for all of BBC television. Knowing a good deal about both natural history and television production, he was obviously the ideal candidate to put together what he calls a ''history of nature'' for the home screen."

CREATION, by Gore Vidal. (Ballantine, $3.95.) In his old age, Cyrus Spitana, a well-connected Persian of the fifth century B.C., recalls his younger years, when his far-ranging travels brought him into contact with the likes of Xerxes, Croesus, the Buddha and Confucius. Our reviewer Paul Theroux remarked that ''Gore Vidal's 17th novel entertains by giving a bystander's view of great men and events and is best when it is poking fun at history, or in places contradicting it.''"
