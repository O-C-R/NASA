At Olan's Golden Rule Bar- B-Que (homemade chili, $1.65), there is a picture of him in the crimson-and- white uniform of the University of Alabama, and another of him in a Jet uniform. He owns 25 percent of the restaurant, so it isn't surprising that there are autographed pictures of him at the cashier's area saying, ''The sandwiches are great.'' Near the door is a poster of him throwing a football under a Jets' logo, with the New York City skyline as the backdrop."

He was 58 years old. Mr. Low had been ill for months, suffering from recurrent melanoma. On Monday the White House announced that he would be awarded the President's Medal of Freedom for his contributions to education and the nation's space program. In his 27 years with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, Mr. Low served as an engineer and manager in the Mercury and Gemini programs and was put in charge of redesigning the Apollo spacecraft after a fire on the launching pad killed three astronauts in 1967."

Content that the city is the center of the cultural universe, they assume that sooner or later there will be a second chance to hear just about any musical event. This weekend, however, will bring three concerts that aren't likely to be repeated soon, even in New York. The pianist and bandleader Sun Ra, who says he was born on Saturn, will assemble a 100-member Arkestra for the first time in a decade; the reclusive New Orleans keyboardist, songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint will play his first full-length New York concerts since the mid-1970's and the French folk-rock group Malicorne, formed in 1973, will play its first American concert."

Leetsma, are to venture outside the space shuttle Challenger to demonstrate techniques for orbital refueling. That flight is scheduled for October."
