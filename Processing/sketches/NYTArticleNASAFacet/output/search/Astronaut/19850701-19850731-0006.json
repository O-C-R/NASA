The flight, set to begin at 4:30 P.M. Friday, is the 19th in the shuttle series and the first for a special package of 13 experiments that are to study the sun, the stars and distant galaxies. The equipment was developed by the European Space Agency as part of the Spacelab program. On two previous shuttle missions, pressurized Spacelab modules have allowed crew members to work on scientific experiments in the shuttle's payload bay. On this Spacelab flight, however, large instrument platforms in the payload bay are to be directly exposed to open space while crew members control them from inside the ship."

They agreed that such a mission could be launched by early in the 21st century and, by sharing the burden of costs and the glory of distant achievement, that it would be an impressive expression of international cooperation and a means of easing tensions between the two nations. They also agreed, however, that the greatest obstacles were more political than technological. James M. Beggs, Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said he saw a Mars venture as an opportunity to ''redirect creative human brains from the prospects of dealing with armed conflict to the prospects of planning and carrying out a peaceful, stimulating and ultimately more valuable program of unprecedented scope.''"
