Five astronauts, six laboratory rats and a 15-ton cargo, including two communications satellites, are scheduled for launching at 8 A. M. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported today that countdown preparations for the 10th shuttle flight were the smoothest ever, almost without flaw. A clear sky and cool temperatures were forecast for liftoff time. The Challenger is to climb to an orbit of 190 miles, where it will deploy two communications satellites on the first two days of the flight. The first is Westar 6 for Western Union Corporation. The second is Palapa B-2 for the Indonesian Government."

It was the second serious mishap to strike this mission, which had already suffered a malfunction that sent a communications satellite into the wrong orbit Friday after what had seemed a flawless launching from the shuttle's cargo bay. Engineers reported today that they had found the satellite and it appeared to be in good shape, but probably would never be usable as a communications relay because it is out of position. Westar Cannot Be Retrieved The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said that although the shuttle was designed to retrieve and repair satellites, the Westar was not built with the grappling fixtures necessary for retrieval because it was supposed go into orbit far out of the shuttle's reach. The satellite malfunction initially forced a one-day delay in the launching of a second communications satellite, the Palapa B-2."

And, more likely than not, on television? Tonight, then, at 9 o'clock, CBS is offering the female equivalent of ''The Right Stuff'' under the title of ''The Sky's No Limit.'' Furthermore, with a script by Renee and Harry Longstreet, it's a pretty good flick. This wholly fictional account is set in 1980, when the United States had yet to send a woman into space even though the Soviet Union has already done just that twice. Indeed, among the National Aviation and Space Administration's 58 astronauts in training, eight are women. With preparations being made for the first flight of the Challenger shuttle, the press and the public are pressing NASA officials for a decision about recruiting a woman for the crew. In this version of things, three women are priority candidates. Being the first woman in space has its own special importance. As one candidate observes, ''I don't remember the guy who followed Columbus, do you?''"

The successful test of the propulsion backpacks - a wireless high-wire act 170 miles above the earth - was an important step toward future operations to repair and service orbiting satellites and to assemble and maintain large space stations. A second test by the same two space fliers, Capt. Bruce McCandless 2d of the Navy and Lieut. Col. Robert L. Stewart of the Army, is scheduled for Thursday morning. They are to practice grappling a large object rotating at the end of the shuttle's mechanical arm, a dress rehearsal for a mission in April to repair a crippled scientific satellite."

In his effort to make an impressive showing against seven other candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 28, the Ohio Senator has been speaking in the argot of a small circle of Washington budget experts. His message is that the economic plans of Walter F. Mondale, the leading Democratic candidate, would provide the nation with deficits bigger than President Reagan's. With the primary only three weeks away, Senator Glenn is continuing his attempt to portray the former Vice President as an excessive spender and the instrument of such special interests as organized labor. But the real motivation behind this increased talk of the national budget appears to be as much an attempt to define Mr. Glenn as it is an effort to define Mr. Mondale."

And I think that in New Hampshire that they don't want the interest groups to be robbing us of our party.''"

      "lead_paragraph": "Two free-flying astronauts joked and turned somersaults in space today and then practiced docking to a satellite berthed in the shuttle Challenger's cargo bay. But a problem with the shuttle's mechanical arm kept them from fully rehearsing the techniques they plan to use for a satellite repair mission in April. An arthritic wrist on a robotic arm prevented them from attempting to latch onto the satellite as it was to have hung out in space, slowly rotating, from the mechanical arm. Despite the loss of this test, space officials said they were satisfied with the equipment and with the rehearsal, in which the astronauts used jet-powered backpacks to maneuver in space."

You might think that after more than half a century, moviemakers - and the people who go to movies - would have become bored by these somewhat less than probing questions, especially since there are now more films that take women seriously than we've had at any time in years, but not at all. The age-old male fantasy about woman's sexual duplicity appears to have endured unscathed into the age of Women's Liberation. Women may well be making their presences felt more than ever before in business, government, science and the arts, and even as characters in other movies, but there are still producers catering to the delirious male suspicion that within every innocent young thing there exists the soul of a wanton."

As campaign strategists had predicted, the attacks on Mr. Mondale were the major feature of the second nationally televised debate of the campaign year. But the two-and-one-half-hour program at the Des Moines Civic Center nine days before Iowa's precinct caucuses failed to generate the heated emotion of the year's first major debate in Hanover, N.H., last month. Like that debate, this one was marked by strong criticism of Presdent Reagan's domestic and foreign policy. The most sharply worded condemnation came from Senator John Glenn of Ohio, who accused Mr. Reagan of following a ''morally bankrupt'' policy in Lebanon."

The major surprises in the nominations announced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences included the spurning of two big-star performances and the nominating of several specialized low-budget movies - all costing less than $5 million and most less than $4 million - for two or more major awards. The low- budget films include ''Reuben, Reuben,'' ''Tender Mercies,'' ''Fanny and Alexander,'' ''Educating Rita,'' and, in particular, ''The Dresser.'' In addition to a nomination for best picture, ''The Dresser'' - which tells the story of the last days of an aging English actor and his relationship with the man who runs his backstage life - received nominations for its two leading actors, Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay; for its screenplay, and, in perhaps the day's biggest surprise, for its director, Peter Yates. ''The Dresser'' was joined in the race for best picture by ''The Big Chill,'' a comedy about seven college friends coming to terms with death and the compromises of adulthood; ''The Right Stuff,'' the story of the first seven American astronauts and the legendary test pilot who preceded them; ''Tender Mercies,'' the redemption of a country-western singer, and ''Terms of Endearment.'' The most notable omission was ''Silkwood,'' which was a runner-up for the New York Film Critics award."

One variety is the self-depreciating kind that still manages to convey a bit of ego. Senator John Glenn, the former astronaut who is one of eight Democrats seeking his party's Presidential nomination, makes use of one. He tells of an effusive introduction he got at some unspecified point in the campaign in which the master of ceremonies ''rattled off every certificate, accolade and achievement I ever had and some I never dreamed of having.'' Then, the tale goes, the introducer says, ''There are few truly great men in the world,'' and Mr. Glenn is presented. Heady stuff, the candidate says. On the way home, he says he turned to his wife, Annie, and said: ''You know, when you think about it, there really are few truly great men in this world.'' And she replies, ''There's surely one less than you think there is.'' He sometimes varies the anecdote by making the ego deflater his daughter, Lyn."

Mondale. Tyra White, who likes Senator Gary Hart, might have to stay home with her daughter. Mr. Mondale sparks little popular enthusiasm. But his backers tend to be activists like Mr. Salisbury, a lawyer and former county chairman, who will bother to trek down to the ornate Jasper County Court House and stand up for their candidate. Senator Hart and some other long-shots have stirred interest. But many of their supporters are neophytes, such as Mrs. White, a 29-year-old housewife, who has never attended a caucus and does not know where hers is being held."

As they have done every four years since 1972, the Iowa caucuses mark the official start of the Presidential campaign year. But the beginning of the 1984 campaign finds the Democratic and Republican parties confronted by very different political tasks in Iowa and around the nation. Different Task for G.O.P. In the coming months, Democratic voters must select a Presidential candidate from among eight major candidates who are in an increasingly bitter contest for the nomination. Republicans must rally public support for an incumbent President who is riding a crest of personal popularity at the same time that his policies are stirring opposition among many important voter groups."

Anyone who needs help to climb Mount Ararat should just telephone Ahmet Aga, Dogubayazit 314 (office) or 410 (home). Ahmet Coktin, who is better known by the traditional Turkish title of respect, Aga, or chief, owns the deed to the southern side of the legendary mountain and believes he knows where Noah's ark can be found. It's no easy feat to climb the peak, but Ahmet Aga has enough knowledge and influence to protect mountain climbers from sheep dogs and nomads and save them from dropping into bottomless snow-covered pits. For the first time in many years, Turkish authorities have opened up Mount Ararat to foreign travelers, who must apply for the necessary permits at least three months in advance. The Mountain of Pain, or Agri Dagi, as it is known in Turkish, has been a restricted zone for at least 13 years and before that there was only limited access. The main reason given was Soviet complaints that the ark seekers were in reality spying on Soviet installations on the other side."

Not far behind Mr. Hart was former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, whose candidacy here was initially regarded as a nostalgic curiosity. Mr. Hart hailed his showing as a breakthrough. But Mr. McGovern's unexpectedly high finish also seemed to mark something of a political resurrection for the man who was the Democrats' nominee in 1972."

The council thus supported the position of the chairman of the endowment, William J. Bennett, who announced last month that he would not set numerical goals for women and minority group members employed by his agency, as required by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to avoid any ''different or special treatment'' based on sex, racial or religious distinctions. Wendell L. Willkie, general counsel of the endowment, said the vote, taken last Friday after a half-hour of debate, showed 13 council members for the resolution and 4 either against or abstaining, by an otherwise unrecorded show of hands. Only 17 of the 26 members, all appointees of President Reagan, were at the quarterly meeting."

William Winter of Mississippi to declare his candidacy for the Senate seat held by Thad Cochran, a Republican completing his first term. But the Democrats still acknowledge they face an uphill fight to regain control of the Senate. ''This is the big break we've been waiting for,'' Audrey Sheppard, assistant executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said of the Winter candidacy. ''It's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time.''"

I N a perfect world, two mainly Republican states that will choose only 2 percent of the 3,933 delegates to this year's Democratic National Convention would have little to do with naming the party's Presidential nominee. But in the highly imperfect world of practical politics, Iowa and New Hampshire are demonstrating once again why they play an outsized role in the nominating process. Iowa's caucuses have been trendsetters since 1972, and since 1952 no candidate has won the Presidency without first winning his party's New Hampshire primary. This year, the fast-starting, ''frontloaded'' campaign calendar is further inflating the already exaggerated importance of these two states."
