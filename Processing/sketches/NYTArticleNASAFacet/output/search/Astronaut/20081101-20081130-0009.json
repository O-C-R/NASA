Just ask Garrett Finney. The former senior architect for NASA's Habitability Design Center, and now a consultant for NASA, is photographed here between Carl Conlee and Evan Twyford, two recent Rhode Island School of Design grads and full-time habitability-center designers, during the recent test run of a first-generation mock-up of a new rover. Working with their ''client,'' the astronaut Mike Gernhardt, as well as a team of about 25 NASA engineers, Conlee and Twyford are devising the interior of the module so that two people will be able to sleep, prepare and eat meals, exercise, use the facilities, drive around and conduct scientific research on missions lasting from two days to two weeks -- all in about 380 cubic feet.
