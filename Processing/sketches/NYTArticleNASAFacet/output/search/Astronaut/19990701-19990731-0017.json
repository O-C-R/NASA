      "lead_paragraph": "We were quite amused and perplexed to see the Science Museum of Long Island referred to as a ''pocket museum'' in the June 20 article, ''Inventing a Science and Technology Museum.'' Over the years, the museum has attracted luminaries such as the Nobel Prize winner Frank Oppenheimer, the astronaut Scott Carpenter, the Russian cosmonaut Viktor Savinhykh, the oceanographer Sylvia Earle, the environmentalist Jim Fowler and the Antarctic specialist Rita Mathews. These and other top scientists have visited the museum and contributed to our courses, workshops and lectures because they felt our hands-on science programs for children were substantive and dynamic. Our director, Dr. John Loret, is a marine biologist who has participated in expeditions with Thor Heyerdahl. Dr. Loret, a former Explorer's Club president, has led more than 35 global science expeditions himself. You don't draw a stellar caliber of people like the ones mentioned to collaborate with or direct an organization when you're merely a ''pocket museum.'' Last year alone, more than 92,000 schoolchildren and adults participated in the museums programs and activities. Our courses run the gamut in variety. In our paleontology program, students actually unearth bones, map them out, then create protective jackets around them just as paleontologists do, or they may build an advanced rocket and launch it in our rocketry program. Others might collect and maintain live specimens from the sea and perform salinity experiments on a boat that goes out in the Long Island Sound. As for our widely popular travel expeditions for adults, CNN filmed our 1998 trip to Easter Island because of the El Nino implications in the Pacific Ocean that we investigated. The program, ''Forging Ahead: Easter Island Expedition,'' aired several times nationally and itnernationally last fall. The History Channel also aired the program this June."

Like the Star Wars trilogy, Mr. Garriott's computer games have evolved technologically. When Ascension, the ninth and final chapter in the Ultima saga, arrives this autumn, Ultima's fictional realm of Brittannia will unfurl on computers that are 266 megahertz or more. But the underlying themes have always been compelling enough to make the story viable, even when computer speeds were in the low double digits."

We strongly agree that a negotiated peace is the best way to make Israel more secure, the best path to lasting stability and prosperity for all the peoples of the Middle East. The Prime Minister is determined to accelerate that process, to reach, with Chairman Arafat, a permanent-status agreement between Israel and the Palestinian people and to achieve a broader regional peace that includes Syria and Lebanon. As he has said, the objective now is to put the peace process back on all its tracks."
