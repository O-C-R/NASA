Romanenko, 36, linked their Soyuz 37 spacecraft with the Salyut 6 space lab at 11:49 P.M. Moscow time. ''After docking and checking the air tightness of the docking unit,'' the two entered Salyut 6 and ''started joint studies on near-terrestrial orbit in the intersts of science and the national economy of socialist countries,'' Tass said."
