He has already made two trips to Moscow that resulted in agreement in principle on 13 educational and cultural exchange proposals, such as bringing a Soviet modern jazz group, the Ganelin Trio, here this summer on a 15-city tour. And he anticipates that his next trip, in June, will bring about agreement on exchanges of museum directors and ballet choreographers and on plans for a football and baseball exhibition. According to Dr. Rhinesmith, at a time when Washington and Moscow remain deeply divided over such issues as arms control and the Libyan raid, his trips have resulted in ''the broadest contact'' any American official has had with Soviet cultural and educational officials in the past decade."

(The two coined the word ''Sots,'' short for ''Socialism,'' as an ironic equivalent for the American term ''Pop.'') In Sots art, banal symbols, icons and signs of the Soviet state are used as departure points for art that can be ironic, nostalgic or comic. Komar and Melamid are its most famous practitioners, but they have been joined here by a number of other Russian emigres."

''We monitor Radio Moscow, but all we hear is the party line.'' Exactly what Radio Moscow is saying, and not saying, about what is believed to be the worst nuclear accident in history is of keen interest to Mr. Bender, and to the rest of the world as well."

      "lead_paragraph": "There's a theme for the weekend,'' David L. Wolper was saying. ''The theme is remember, rejoice, renew. We're going to be reflecting about how everyone came to this country. We're going to rejoice by having a great party. And we're going to renew everything the Statue of Liberty stands for.'' Mr. Wolper, the television and movie producer, has been recruited to do for New York and the statue what he did for Los Angeles and the flamboyant opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games in 1984. Rain or shine, Liberty Weekend '86, a huge series of celebrations under Mr. Wolper's direction, will transfigure the New York and New Jersey sides of the harbor from Thursday night, July 3, to Sunday night, July 6. Mr. Wolper was favored by the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation because while other producers might talk in terms of dozens, or even hundreds, he tends to think in terms of thousands."

And afterward, in a newly cleared plot surrounded by the fields where he picked cotton as a boy, the remains of the Challenger astronaut were finally laid to rest. His journey - from birth in a small wooden house with no plumbing, through the segregated school system of his formative years here, to an engineering degree and a doctorate in physics, to research in laser physics at the Hughes Laboratory outside Los Angeles, to acceptance in the astronaut program, to his flight around the earth in the space shuttle Challenger in 1984, to his death in its explosion this January - required 35 years."

Late next year, they may have to adjust that image, if, as proposed, a United States-built communications satellite is launched into space aboard a Chinese Long March-3 rocket from a space center set in the hilly woodlands of southern Sichuan. If the launching succeeds, a second privately owned United States satellite will follow in 1988. According to Chinese officials, up to nine other nations have shown interest in similar deals. The memorandum of agreement announced last week by Teresat Inc. of Houston and the China Great Wall Industry Corporation, an agency of the Astronautics Ministry, came against the background of uncertainty in the United States space industry following four major launching failures in the past 16 weeks, including the loss of the space shuttle Challenger Jan. 28."

When the prototype ''Biosphere II'' structure is completed in 1989, its developers say, eight volunteers will be sealed inside it for two years, cut off from everything except sunlight. They will become part of an intricate ecosystem that includes miniature oceans, rain forests, marshlands and deserts, all contained in an airtight shell of steel and glass. Everything in this manmade world will be recycled. Carbon dioxide exhaled by humans will be used by plants, while oxygen given off by the plants will revitalize the air for human breathing. Human wastes will provide fertilizer for land crops and feed algae, bacteria and water plants, which in turn will feed fish."
