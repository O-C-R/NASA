Chords from a phantom chorus wafted from a keyboard, and Mr. Bowie intoned: ''It's the beginning of an end, and nothing has changed. Everything has changed.''"

Typically, it has the word ''young'' in it and doctors/lawyers/detectives fighting the system/one another. This phrase will be polished to perfection and then sold to agents, to the networks and -- assuming months of unbelievable luck -- to audiences via TV listings. Often, at first, it is cribbed from another show. Last summer, Rod Lurie's agent arranged a meeting with a production company that was looking to set up a ''very rich'' TV deal for him. They just needed an idea. A former film journalist, Lurie is the 40-year-old director of the movies ''The Contender'' (which he also wrote) and ''The Last Castle''; he is sedate and articulate and has a sincere adoration for film. His dimly lighted office in North Hollywood is wallpapered with autographed movie posters and his 1984 diploma from West Point. ''I had never thought about TV in any way,'' Lurie admits, which became clear when the executives showed up. ''I had no ideas,'' he says. ''So I said: 'I watch ''The West Wing,'' and I see a show about good people doing the right thing. Why don't we do a show about bad people doing the wrong thing?'''"
