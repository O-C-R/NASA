      "lead_paragraph": "10 P.M. (NBC) CONVICTION -- Dick Wolf, creator of the ''Law & Order'' empire, introduces a drama series about glamorous young lawyers in the district attorney's office. In the premiere episode, a drug dealer cuts open a woman's abdomen to retrieve the drugs she smuggled for him; one inexperienced lawyer on her first trial cleverly leaves the evidence unguarded; and another blithely tells a stranger where his boss is having dinner, information that leads to a fatal shooting. That's Stephanie March (above) as Alexandra Cabot, a character who has transferred here from ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.'' 8 P.M. (Encore) ANNIE HALL (1977). Woody Allen's best-picture Oscar winner stars Mr. Allen as Alvy Singer, the quintessential New York neurotic, and Diane Keaton as the eccentrically dressed, adorably ditsy Midwestern young woman that he loves. The film took home three more Oscars -- for best director, actress and screenplay (Mr. Allen and Marshall Brickman). 8 P.M. (5) N.A.A.C.P. IMAGE AWARDS -- ''Crash,'' the drama about race relations in Los Angeles, is the movie with the most nominations. ''Grey's Anatomy,'' ''Everybody Hates Chris'' and ''The Bernie Mac Show'' are among the nominated television series. The show also honors achievement in music (Carlos Santana, above, will be inducted into the hall of fame) and literature. Cuba Gooding Jr. is host. 9 P.M. (NBC) LAS VEGAS -- A woman finds a finger in the casino's new buffet. But there's a chance, as in a similar real-life case, that it was planted. And rather than suing the casino, the woman makes another, more personal demand. It involves Danny (Josh Duhamel). 10 P.M. (USA) MONK -- Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective, suspects an astronaut of murder. 10 P.M. (CBS) NUMB3RS -- An antiwar-protest bombing looks like the work of a 1970's activist who went underground (or at least dropped out of sight) roughly 30 years ago. 10 P.M. (Sundance) IN SHORT: ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING SHORTS -- Five of them. ''The Wrong Trousers'' and ''A Close Shave'' are Wallace and Gromit animated films from Nick Park (shown at Cannes with a statue of Gromit). ''Ryan'' is Chris Landreth's portrait of an artist turned panhandler. ''Wasp'' is about a working-class British single mother of four. And ''Harvie Krumpet'' is about a home-schooled Polish boy with Tourette's syndrome. ANITA GATES"

Theater Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Previews and Openings 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' Opens Sunday. The resourceful Pearl Theater tries to provide an answer to this problem play (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. 'BERNARDA ALBA' Opens Monday. The Tony winner Phylicia Rashad (''A Raisin in the Sun'') plays another formidable matriarchal figure with an iron will in Lincoln Center Theater's musical version of Lorca's ''House of Bernarda Alba.'' Michael John LaChiusa, who already has one musical to his name this season, ''See What I Wanna See,'' contributes music and lyrics (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. 'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' Opens Monday. This artistic hybrid by Wallace Shawn and his brother, Allen, is a drama about the making of an opera that features -- are you still following? -- operatic flashbacks (1:50). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. 'GREY GARDENS' Opens Tuesday. Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'FAMILY SECRETS' Opens Wednesday. Sherry Glaser plays her entire family in this revival of her 1993 autobiographical solo show about moving from the Bronx to Southern California (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. 'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE' Opens Wednesday. A new play by David Grimm (''Kit Marlowe'') that is part Restoration comedy, part modern sex comedy (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. 'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!' Previews start tonight. Opens 9Thursday. It's been almost four decades since Joel Grey starred on Broadway as the complex, brilliant composer in ''George M!'' -- more than enough time for another look at the author of ''Yankee Doodle Dandy.'' In this version, which includes the songs of Mr. Cohan, Jon Peterson stars (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Opens March 16. Alec Baldwin stars in Joe Orton's jet-black comedy about a handsome stranger who seduces everyone else onstage (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. 'HARD RIGHT' Previews start Tuesday. Opens March 12. In David Barth's dark comedy, a slacker college student takes his girlfriend home to meet his parents, and a family trauma interrupts everything (1:30). Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. 'JACQUES BRIEL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' Previews start Sunday. Opens March 27. Something of a phenomenon in the late 1960's, the French singer's romantic music returns to New York in this musical, which features tangos, ballads, boleros and rock 'n' roll (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'RING OF FIRE' Opens March 12. Johnny Cash hits form the backbone of this musical about three couples. So far, it's received surprisingly good buzz. Richard Maltby Jr. directs (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'SIDD' Opens March 15. Herman Hesse's novel ''Siddhartha,'' the musical version (2:15). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'ACTS OF MERCY: PASSION-PLAY' If there is a coherent story to Michael John Garcés' ''Acts of Mercy: passion-play,'' it is resolutely kept from the audience. As the efforts of two brothers to reconcile with a dying father progress, it seems possible that viewers are meant to discern the consequences of family trauma from punchy monosyllabic combat and repeated expletives, but their efforts to connect are continually frustrated (2:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, west of Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Honor Moore) * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CHRISTINE JORGENSON REVEALS' Bradford Louryk meticulously lip-syncs a fascinating hourlong interview about gender and sexuality with Ms. Jorgenson, whose sex change operation in the 1950's was big news (1:00). The Studio Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CLEAN ALTERNATIVES' Brian Dykstra's improbable comedy details the good fight fought by a businesswoman turned environmental activist taking on a toxin-spreading megacorporation. The play also depicts the moral transformation of a rapacious lawyer into a love-smitten puppy dog. Call it a fairy tale for our time (2:00). 59E59 Theaters , 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Zinoman) 'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'FANNY HILL' It's a musical version of the scandalous John Cleland novel, but it's not scandalous, very. It is, however, sometimes pretty funny, thanks to the incongruous eye of Ed Dixon, who wrote the book, lyrics and music (2:10). York Theater, at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger) 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' A comedy by Kenny Finkle about a housecat torn between affection for her human companion and a sexy tomcat promising a tour of the great outdoors. Directed by Darren Goldstein and energetically performed by a cast of four, it's essentially just another dysfunctional relationship tale, with little kitty whiskers drawn on (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, the play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SOLDIER'S WIFE' When this play first opened on Broadway, World War II was shuddering to a close, and those on the home front wanted to feel good. Despite flaws in the work, the Mint Theater Company's revival of Rose Franken's 1944 comedy is highly entertaining (2:00). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Moore) * '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) 'THE WOODEN BREEKS' The line dividing inspired whimsy from tedious nonsense can be a fine one, and much of this new play by Glen Berger falls on the wrong side of it. An elaborately conceived comedy seeking to celebrate the consolations of storytelling, it unfolds the tale of a Scottish tinker who dreams up imaginary worlds to keep despair at bay. The cast is colorful, but the play is pallid, despite an intricate -- make that convoluted -- narrative (2:00). MCC Theater, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) Off Off Broadway 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. o.e. (Rob Kendt) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, closing Wednesday. (Genzlinger) 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'AQUAMARINE' (PG, 109 minutes) In this sweet comedy for the crowd that has outgrown ''The Little Mermaid,'' two likable pals (Emma Roberts and Joanna Levesque) try to help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) find love and learn how to use her feet properly. (Neil Genzlinger) 'BATTLE IN HEAVEN' (No rating, 94 minutes, in Spanish) An alternatingly mesmerizing and off-putting story about sex, class, God, soccer, an ugly man, a beautiful woman, a dead baby, the dirt below them and the wide sky above. The talented Mexican director Carlos Reygadas (''Japón'') strives to say something about his country, to tap into the spiritual and material desperation of its people, but doesn't seem especially committed to his material. (Manohla Dargis) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DIRTY' (R, 97 minutes) Cuba Gooding Jr. steps over to the bad side in a nihilistic, profanity-packed melodrama of corrupt Los Angeles cops that wants to be ''Training Day'' with street cred. It misses by a mile. (Holden) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie clichés, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis) 'FREEDOMLAND' (R, 113 minutes) This inept, lethally dull drama directed by Joe Roth and written by Richard Price, from his novel, involves a white child who may have gone missing in a New Jersey public housing complex, where the residents are all black. A loud Samuel L. Jackson and a miscast Julianne Moore star. (Dargis) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOME' (No rating, 91 minutes) In ''Home,'' the debut feature from the writer and director Matt Zoller Seitz, a party in a Brooklyn brownstone is peopled by familiar types: the sensitive music geek, the slutty ex-girlfriend, the pretentious European writer. As dreams are interpreted, hearts are bruised, and a loudmouth in a velour tracksuit gets undeservedly lucky, ''Home'' accumulates a blurry, on-the-fly atmosphere spiked with moments of unexpected sweetness. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'LITTLE FISH' (R, 114 minutes) In this tough, savvy Australian film, Cate Blanchett sinks deeply into the role of a 32-year-old recovering heroin addict trying to rebuild her life and fighting the temptation to relapse. (Holden) * 'LOVE' (No rating, 93 minutes) Cool, mysterious and defiantly foreign, ''Love'' plays out on the immigrant fringes of an indifferent New York City. A Yugoslavian hit man, his German ex-wife and her cop boyfriend form a love triangle that propels a cosmopolitan cast into a violent game of cat and mouse. In these bleak, isolated neighborhoods, exquisitely shot by the Serbian cinematographer Vladimir Subotic, love and politics are inseparable, and the gleam of Manhattan is a million miles away. (Catsoulis) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) 'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) 'RUNNING SCARED' (R, 122 minutes) The idea here is meta-movie to the max, a deconstructed modern action flick by way of the brothers Grimm, in which few live happily ever after, and most don't even make it to the next day. Too bad that the director Wayne Kramer proves blood simple. (Dargis) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) 'SORRY, HATERS' (No rating, 83 minutes) Shamelessly drawing on post-Sept. 11 anxieties, ''Sorry, Haters'' follows the increasingly irrational involvement of a New York cab driver (Abdellatif Kechiche), who is also a Syrian Muslim, and a disturbed fare (Robin Wright Penn). Yet despite the impressive commitment of the two leads, the movie unfolds with such utter looniness that the final, horrible moments are more likely to inspire laughter than shock. Apparently, the worst threat facing America today is not Islamic extremists but lonely young women with low self-esteem. (Catsoulis) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'TSOTSI' (R, 94 minutes) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis) 'UNKNOWN WHITE MALE' (PG-13, 88 minutes) The British filmmaker Rupert Murray tells the bizarre story of his old friend Doug Bruce, who in 2003 walked into a Coney Island hospital claiming not to know who he was, thereupon becoming either a heart-wrenching casualty of a medical anomaly or the prime suspect in a mystery yet to be solved. (Dargis) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series ANNA MAY WONG (Through April 16) Wong, the first Chinese-American movie star, would have turned 100 last year. (She died in 1961.) The Museum of the Moving Image's extensive seven-week retrospective of her work begins tomorrow with ''The Toll of the Sea'' (1922), a silent color feature based on ''Madama Butterfly''; and ''Piccadilly'' (1929), in which Wong plays a scullery maid who moves up to nightclub stages. Both films will be accompanied by live music. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. It continues this weekend with ''The Other Side'''' (2005), Natalia Almada's portrait of a young Mexican man trying to sing his way out of poverty; and ''A Model for Matisse: The Story of the Vence Chapel'' (2005), about Henri Matisse's friendship and special project with a French Dominican nun. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) ISRAEL FILM FESTIVAL (Through Thursday) This 21st annual festival continues this weekend with films including Eyal Ilan's ''Comrade'' (2005), about an adolescent boy's relationship with his sister's Communist neighbor; and Thorold Dickinson's ''Hill 24 Doesn't Answer''(1955), the personal stories of four young Zionists guarding a strategic spot outside Jerusalem. Clearview Cinema, 62nd Street and Broadway, (877) 966-5566; $10. (Gates) MAN IN THE DUNES: DISCOVERING HIROSHI TESHIGAHARA (Through March 19) BAMcinématek's tribute to Teshigahara (1927-2001), the artist, filmmaker and flower arranger, continues this weekend with ''Pitfall'' (1962), his first feature, about a mysterious killer and a small mining town. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Jean Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. This weekend's films are ''Le Beau Serge'' (1958), Claude Chabrol's drama about a man who returns to his hometown to find a childhood friend in bad shape; and ''Le Bleu du Ciel'' (2000), Christian Dor's short about a teenage boy home from a psychiatric hospital. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) SOME KIND OF HORROR SHOW (Through March 30) BAMcinématek's annual festival of horror movies begins on Monday with Dario Argento's ''Four Flies on Grey Velvet'' (1971), about a rock musician with a stalker. Other films in the series will include John Landis's ''Innocent Blood'' (1992), the adventures of a modern-day vampire who bites only bad people; Nicholas Roeg's ''Witches'' (1990), about a coven's convention; and ''Twisted Nerve'' (1968), a splatter movie with a Bernard Hermann score. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BELLE AND SEBASTIAN/NEW PORNOGRAPHERS (Tonight) The deceptively gentle rock of the Scottish group Belle and Sebastian continues to find the exquisite balance between loll and lash. The New Pornographers are a revved-up Vancouver outfit whose smart power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until Neko Case's voice cuts through like a skywriter. 8:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $30 (Sold out). (Laura Sinagra) BLEEDING THROUGH, EVERY TIME I DIE (Thursday) Sidestepping the cookie-cutter emo punk stereotype, Bleeding Through plays speedy thrash metal. The Buffalo rockers Every Time I Die inject their version of hard-charging punk-metal with country swagger and gutter sleaze. 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16.75 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra) MICHAEL BUBLÉ (Tomorrow) The crooner Michael Bublé has Bobby Darin as a polestar and Frank Sinatra to crib from. He also has looks, and tips his hat to modern styles, even rap, in ways that assure 50-year-old fans that they're not 80-year-old fans. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $49.50 to $104.50. (Sinagra) CLOUD ROOM (Tomorrow) The new-wave-influenced naïf rockers the Cloud Room garnered wild, though deeply underground, buzz when their best song, ''Hey Hey Now,'' written in the throes of the frontman's grave illness, was given lots of wish-you-wells but never broke into larger indie-pop consciousness. The indie-rock band Film School also plays. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sinagra) COMMON, FLOETRY (Sunday) The Chicago rapper Common has at times deserved the stigma attached to the label ''conscious rap'' -- preachiness and lackluster execution. On his latest material, though, he meets the challenge by working with the ''it'' producer Kanye West. The two women of Floetry mix the tough and the gentle amid a spirit of jazzy uplift. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $38.50 to $40. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) EBONY ECUMENICAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) This community choral group celebrates its 27th year with a repertory spanning what it calls the African-American religious experience. 7:30 p.m., Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 870-6722; $15 to $35. (Sinagra) DONALD FAGEN (Tonight and Tuesday) Steely Dan's jaded jazz-rocker tours in support of his first solo album since 1993, ''Morph the Cat'' (Reprise), on which, among other things, he focuses his recognizable leer on a hot airport security babe. Tonight at 8, North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800; $60 to $85. Tuesday at 8 p.m.., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $53.50 to $92. (Sinagra) GOGOGO AIRHEART, JAI-ALAI SAVANT, SUBTITLE (Monday) The Mars Volta guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez put together this tour to showcase bands on his record label, GSL, including the punky Gogogo Airheart, the reggae-punk Jai-Alai Savant and the Los Angeles rapper Subtitle. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra) DARYL HALL AND JOHN OATES (Tomorrow) The Philadelphia pop duo has always relied on the blue-eyed-soul crooner Daryl Hall's ability to emote within tight rhythmic constraints while John Oates harmonizes urgently above. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $40 to $93.50. (Sinagra) HAMELL ON TRIAL (Tonight and tomorrow night) The songwriter Ed Hamell whips up intense ditties commenting on the hypocrisies of modern life. The cultural climate, rife with saccharine displays and religious and moral piety, leaves the composer of ''Songs for Parents Who Enjoy Drugs'' no shortage of inspiration. 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12. (Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Tomorrow) The iconic piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50. (Sinagra) THE KLEZMATICS: 20TH ANNIVERSARY (Sunday) The Klezmatics love the laughing, moaning melodies of traditional klezmer music. They also love jazz, rock and downtown improvisation, and they bring all those styles to bear on their music, which can be raucous, hypnotic, reverent and dizzying, sometimes all in one quick-changing piece. They carry klezmer's itinerant, idea-gathering spirit all the way into present-day New York City. 4 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 to $37.50. (Jon Pareles) SERENA MANEESH (Monday) This Norwegian band takes a lighthearted approach to distorted, textured rock blare. Its alternately screeching and orchestral atmospherics are mismatched with vocal purr and squawk. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, 15 at the door. (Sinagra) DAVE MASON (Monday) The singer-guitarist Dave Mason, maybe best known for his work with Traffic, is the distinctive voice behind songs like ''Feelin' Alright'' and ''We Just Disagree.'' 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra) MASTERS OF PERSIAN MUSIC (Sunday) Playing the music of Iran's Persian classical tradition and celebrating the heritage of Sufi poetry, this group features the vocalist Mohammad Reza Shajarian, with Hossein Alizadeh on the lute and Kayhan Kalhor on the spike fiddle. Shajarian's son Homayoun accompanies on the tombak drum and vocals. 7 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $50. (Sinagra) MATISYAHU (Monday and Tuesday) Matisyahu's Hasidic dancehall blends the rabbinical and the Rastafarian, combining a kind of Deadhead playfulness with resolute moralism as he chants -- sometimes in English, sometimes in Yiddish, sometimes in Caribbean patois. He is promoting a new album, recorded with the producer Bill Laswell. 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-7740; $25.50 in advance, $27.50 at the door. (Sinagra) MOGWAI (Monday) This majestic Glasgow outfit has mixed heavy rock intensity with flowing atmospheric beauty for a decade now. Its new material is some of its best. 7:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) LE MYSTÈRE DES VOIX BULGARES (Tonight) Started 50 years ago with the goal of expanding the scope of Bulgarian folk music, Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares explores the possibilities of close harmonies, dissonance, unexpected rhythms and vocal tones that move from haunting to jarringly pointed. This performance, falling on Bulgarian Independence Day, is the group's first in the city in more than a decade. 7:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $23 to $28. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) NADA SURF, ROGUE WAVE (Wednesday) The Brooklyn alt-rockers Nada Surf tumbled into obscurity after a mid-90's MTV hit, then re-emerged in 2002 with the lovingly fashioned ''Let Go'' (Barsuk), which squints nostalgically at imagined childhood bliss through a snowy pane. Subsequent albums have continued in this style. Rogue Wave is a meditative band that plays the kind of wishing-well rock that, when done right, adds gravitas to your flakiest concerns. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sinagra) OF MONTREAL (Tonight) Part of the tail end of the mid-90's heyday of the Athens, Ga., indie-rock collective Elephant 6, the band Of Montreal has outlived lots of its other acts and continues to make fanciful melodic pop. 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $14. (Sold out.) (Sinagra) AMY RIGBY (Tonight) This singer-songwriter ponders romance and decline with biting wit. She gave Nashville a try, but she's back home in New York, where her brand of real-life feistiness has always been a better fit. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $20. (Sinagra) THE ROGERS SISTERS, CELEBRATION (Thursday) The Brooklyn power trio the Rogers Sisters have plied their perky new-wave craft during the recent spate of 80's revivalism in Williamsburg, though they seem to take themselves less seriously than most. Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra) THE STROKES, EAGLES OF DEATH METAL (Tonight and tomorrow night) Six years ago, with its exaggerated Tom Petty-like jitters and rich hipster slumming, the Strokes convinced jaded late-1990's clubbers that rock was back. The Eagles of Death Metal is the side project of the Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme, who indulges some of his funkier impulses. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $35. (Sinagra) THE WEDDING PRESENT, SALLY CREWE AND THE SUDDEN MOVES (Monday and Wednesday) After spending the late 90's in relative domestic bliss and putting out records with the band Cinerama, David Gedge has returned to his previous band the Wedding Present, and to the dirty-strummed electric bitterness that made it so beloved. Sally Crewe, a spunky Briton, unpins her lyrical wit with elemental guitar rock punch. Monday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $tk. (Sold out.) Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $16. (Sinagra) WOLF EYES, PIG DESTROYER (Tomorrow) Wolf Eyes is a noise band from Montreal; Pig Destroyer plays grindcore metal. 11:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) THE WOOD BROTHERS (Tuesday) The Wood Brothers are Oliver and Chris Wood, musical siblings reared in the Northwest, whose divergent paths led Oliver to blues-rock bands in Atlanta and Chris to New York, where he ended up in Medeski, Martin and Wood. Together they make roots rock. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $15. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. * 'THE BROADWAY MUSICALS OF 1930' (Monday) The sixth-season opening concert of Scott Siegel's ebullient and informative Broadway by the Year series will feature Nancy Anderson, Celia Keenan-Bolger, Marc Kudisch, Deven May, Emily Skinner, Mary Testa, Jennifer Simard and Michael Winther, among others. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $40 and $45. (Stephen Holden) BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Holden) KITTY CARLISLE HART (Tonight and tomorrow night) New York's grande dame of the performing arts is ageless, regal, entertaining and, at 95, can still sing. 8:30, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095; $60, with a $40 minimum. (Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Tomorrow) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 7 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.

(Chinen) CYRUS CHESTNUT QUINTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Chestnut is a stalwart, straight-ahead pianist, especially when it comes to gospel and the blues; here, as on his strong new album, ''Genuine Chestnut'' (Telarc), the guitarist Mark Whitfield is a guest. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.

(Chinen) 4 GENERATIONS OF MILES (Through Sunday) The rapid permutation of Miles Davis's working bands makes it theoretically possible for four former sidemen to claim connection to four separate phases of his career; the musicians in question are the drummer Jimmy Cobb, the tenor saxophonist George Coleman, the bassist Buster Williams and the guitarist Mike Stern. 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $32.50 and $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) JERRY GONZALEZ AND THE FORT APACHE BAND (Tonight) The Afro-Caribbean jazz master Jerry Gonzalez and his band set their improvisations to driving Latin rhythms. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 and $37.50. (Laura Sinagra) * FRED HERSCH (Through Sunday) Mr. Hersch's solo piano recitals are transcendent affairs, as evidenced most recently by an excellent album called ''Fred Hersch in Amsterdam: Live at the Bimhuis'' (Palmetto). He is the first solo pianist ever to headline a weeklong Village Vanguard engagement. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) * ANDREW HILL QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Time Lines,'' Mr. Hill's new Blue Note recording, updates his visionary work of the 1960's with a patiently exploratory brand of post-bop. This engagement features the same superb ensemble as on the album: Mr. Hill on piano, Charles Tolliver on trumpet, Greg Tardy on tenor saxophone and clarinets, John Hebert on bass and Eric McPherson on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) I LOVE A PIANO (Thursday) The latest installation of Jack Kleinsinger's Highlights in Jazz series features three good pianists: Barbara Carroll and Eric Reed, each with a trio, and Junior Mance, playing solo. 8 p.m., Tribeca Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 220-1460; $30; $27.50 for students. (Chinen) AHMAD JAMAL TRIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) A touchstone of jazz piano since the 50's, Mr. Jamal still has his broad dynamic range and signature touch; his highly sympathetic rhythm section consists of the bassist James Cammack and the drummer Idris Muhammad. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables and a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) JOE LOVANO QUARTET (Wednesday through March 11) Mr. Lovano has become one of the stalwart saxophonists in modern jazz, equally inspired by John Coltrane's harmonic inquiry, Ornette Coleman's off-kilter lyricism and Ben Webster's heart-rending croon. This band, his newest, includes James Weidman on piano, Esperanza Spalding on bass and Francisco Mela on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) EIVIND OPSVIK'S OVERSEAS (Monday) Mr. Opsvik is a Norwegian bassist and composer who balances avant-gardism against poplike lyricism, as he demonstrates here in a band with Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone, Jacob Sacks on piano and Kenny Wollesen on drums. 9:30 p.m., Mundial, 505 East 12th Street, East Village, (212) 982-1282, mundialnyc.com; no cover. (Chinen) CHRIS POTTER'S UNDERGROUND (Tuesday through March 12) The saxophonist Chris Potter has an improvisational approach that's intellectual and athletic in equal measure; his band Underground dives headlong into edgy fusion, with Adam Rogers on guitar, Craig Taborn on Fender Rhodes piano and Nate Smith on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20 and $25.(Chinen) WALLACE RONEY SEXTET (Tuesday through March 12) On his recent album ''Mystikal'' (High Note), Mr. Roney advanced a variety of Afrocentric futurism inherited and adapted from his trumpet mentor, Miles Davis. He explores similar territory in an ensemble with his wife, Geri Allen, on piano; his brother, Antoine Roney, on tenor and soprano saxophones; and the unrelated rhythm section of Val Jeanty on turntables, Clarence Seay on bass and Eric Allen on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) PONCHO SANCHEZ (Through Sunday) Mr. Sanchez, a high-spirited conga player, has been one of the leading figures in Latin jazz for more than 20 years, in large part because of this effervescent working band. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar and a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) JENNY SCHEINMAN QUARTET (Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre; she performs with the pianist Art Hirahara, the bassist Danton Boller and the drummer Mark Ferber. 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen) TONE COLLECTOR (Wednesday) This experimental acoustic threesome, made up of the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Jeff Davis, released a bristling debut last year on Norway's Jazzaway label; they're joined here by the trombonists Ben Gerstein (at 8 p.m.) and Brian Allen (at 10 p.m.). 8 and 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit and love of Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, all the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece if not always of the pitch. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) 'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Wednesday) Alfano's amiable, ambling version of ''Cyrano'' continues its Met run, and Plácido Domingo is expected to return, after vocal problems, to the title role. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6200; $26 to $175. (Bernard Holland) 'DARKLING' (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) In an adventurous move, American Opera Projects is presenting a brave and sensitive, if at times frustrating, multimedia work. With a score by Stefan Weisman, ''Darkling'' is an ''operatic fantasia on themes of emotional fragmentation,'' in the words of the director Michael Comlish, who conceived the idea of adapting for the stage Anna Rabinowitz's book-length poem about a restless Polish couple who marry hastily before the invasion of the Nazis. 8 p.m., East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly ludicrous libretto of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996 and hidden away in storage since then, offers little help, but the Met does have a solid cast, with Deborah Voigt, Salvatore Licitra and Mark Delavan. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 to $220 remaining tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Allan Kozinn) * 'MAZEPPA' (Monday) The Metropolitan Opera has never before staged Tchaikovsky's ''Mazeppa,'' although the Kirov Opera brought it to the stage here in 1998. The Kirov has a strong role in this brand-new staging: it's a co-production with the Met, conducted by the Met's principal guest conductor and Kirov head, Valery Gergiev, with Olga Guryakova, Larissa Diadkova, Nikolai Putilin and Paata Burchuladze in leading roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $35 to $250. (Midgette) 'THE MOST HAPPY FELLA' (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) For the 50th anniversary of Frank Loesser's wonderful musical, the New York City Opera opens its spring season with its production, by Philip Wm. McKinley. Though the company has had mixed success with presenting musicals, this production looks intriguing. The compelling actor Paul Sorvino takes the title role of Tony, an aging immigrant vineyard owner who courts a struggling young waitress through the mail. Loesser's rich and tuneful score is more sophisticated than many an opera. George Manahan conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 and 8:30 p.m., and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. (previews); Tuesday at 6:30 p.m., and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45 to $120. (Tommasini) 'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The big news from the Met's new production of this Gounod opera is the French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay. Singing with uncanny agility and lyrical elegance, she touchingly embodies the tragically impulsive young Juliette. The tenor Ramón Vargas, though a stiff actor, delivers a vocally impassioned Roméo. Bertrand de Billy conducts a refined account of Gounod's most sophisticated score. (For the final performance on Thursday, Maureen O'Flynn replaces Ms. Dessay.) Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Thursday. (Tommasini) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight) José Luis Duval as Alfredo joins Angela Gheorghiu in this successful revival at the Met. 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out. (Holland) 'TREEMONISHA' (Thursday) The enterprising and top-rate Collegiate Chorale, with Robert Bass conducting, presents a semistaged performance of Scott Joplin's 1911 opera, ''Treemonisha,'' conceived by Roger Rees. To appreciate this humane and musically beguiling work, you have to look past what contemporary audiences might see as stereotyped depictions of former slaves during Reconstruction. Still, the story is told from the perspectives of the newly freed slaves, who turn to a modest and educated young girl, Treemonisha, as their leader. And Joplin's wistful music is subtle and affecting. Anita Johnson sings the title role. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500: $25 to $60. (Tommasini) Classical Music ANNE AZÉMA, JOEL COHEN and SHIRA KAMMEN (Sunday) The lutenist Joel Cohen has assembled many an inventive program for his Boston Camerata, and he brings his latest -- ''Chanson du Désert: The Heroic Deeds of Guillaume d'Orange'' -- to the Cloisters for two performances. The performance, to be sung by Anne Azéma and Shira Kemmen, centers on works about the eighth- and ninth-century warrior who fought for Charlemagne and is the subject of four medieval epic poems. 1 and 3 p.m., Fort Tryon Park, (212) 650-2290; $35. (Kozinn) * MAYA BEISER (Thursday) Formerly the cellist of the Bang on a Can All-Stars, Ms. Beiser has spread her wings into an even more eclectic and distinctive solo career. Her recital at Zankel Hall presents four world premieres, including a new work by Eve Beglarian, with accompanying video by the acclaimed artist Shirin Neshat. The other new works are by Michael Gordon, Joby Talbot and Brett Dean. 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 and $35. (Midgette) BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) It's no doubt just a coincidence, but on Monday, when the Metropolitan Opera presents its premiere production of Tchaikovsky's ''Mazeppa'' with Valery Gergiev, James Levine, the Met's music director, will be at Carnegie Hall conducting this orchestra in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. If you choose to go with Beethoven and Mr. Levine, you will also hear Schoenberg's breakthrough work, the Chamber Symphony No. 1. And the roster of vocal soloists for the Beethoven, topped by the soprano Christine Brewer, looks enticing. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $52 to $175. (Tommasini) IAN BOSTRIDGE (Wednesday) This elegant, brainy British tenor is joined by a handful of colleagues -- including the countertenor Bejun Mehta and the tenor Nathan Gunn -- for an installment in his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall. His subject this time is Britten, who will be explored by way of his ''Winter Words,'' as well as all five Canticles. 7:30. Zankel Hall, at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $40 to $48. (Kozinn) PAUL GALBRAITH (Tomorrow) By using an eight-string guitar, played as if it were a cello -- held vertically, and resting on a peg connected to a resonating box -- Mr. Galbraith has been able expand the volume, range and harmonic possibilities available to him. He is also a thoughtful player, and his program includes his own arrangements of Bach's Cello Suite No. 4, Ravel's ''Mother Goose'' Suite -- a stretch for the guitar, but his solutions should be fascinating -- and works by Rameau, Martin and Mozart. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $40. (Kozinn) * HESPÈRION XXI AND LA CAPELLA REIAL DE CATALUNYA (Tomorrow) As part of an extended visit with his various ensembles that includes performances all over Manhattan, Jordi Savall leads his remarkable Hespèrion XXI ensemble and his vocal group in works by Spanish composers, among them, Gaspar Sanz, Luis Milán, Santiago de Murcia and Matheo Flecha. 8 p.m., Church of St. Paul the Apostle, Columbus Avenue at 60th Street, (212) 854-7799; $40. (Kozinn) JERUSALEM SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Leon Botstein has carved out a career as a conductor on a combination of erudition and crack fund-raising skills. This weekend he comes to the New York area on tour with one of his orchestras in an uncharacteristically mainstream program that includes Copland's ''Appalachian Spring'' and Prokofiev's Fifth. (The orchestra comes to Carnegie Hall on March 12.) Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tilles Center at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100; $48 to $88. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bergen Performing Arts Center, Englewood, N.J., (201) 816-8160; $10 to $50. Thursday at 8 p.m., Community Theater, Morristown, N.J., (973) 539-8008; $40 to $47. (Midgette) 'LA LÉGENDE D'EER' (Tonight) For the 1978 opening of the Pompidou Center in Paris, the composer Iannis Xenakis created this multimedia piece, which combined music, architecture, light imagery and texts and played for three months. Last year Mode Records released a DVD and CD of the work, and tonight, in the second of two performances, it will be recreated live. 8, Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 979-1027; $12. (Tommasini) MUSICIANS FROM MARLBORO (Tonight and tomorrow) Every season this renowned festival in Vermont sends rosters of performers, both veteran artists and young talents, on tour across the country. Two different groups are performing in New York this weekend. Tonight the pianist Gilbert Kalish is joined by several impressive wind players in works by Nielsen, Schubert, Carter and Beethoven. Tomorrow the Peoples' Symphony Concerts series presents a roster of string players and the pianist Jeremy Denk in works by John Harbison, Ravel and Schubert. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; $40. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9. (Tommasini) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday) Ludovic Morlot will make his Philharmonic conducting debut with music by Elliott Carter and Schumann, as well as the Brahms Violin Concerto with Frank Peter Zimmermann. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday night at 7:30, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Holland) RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA (Sunday, Monday and Wednesday) Three concerts of Russian music played by Russians. The conductor Vladimir Jurowski brings Yefim Bronfman to play Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto on Sunday, and continues with some Stravinsky and much more Tchaikovsky. Sunday at 3 p.m., Monday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Holland) DORA SERES (Tuesday) The organization Young Concert Artists often presents New York recital debuts by its latest audition winners, but this week's recital by Dora Seres, a young Hungarian flutist, definitely does not appear to be more of the same -- at least on paper -- because of striking programming that includes works by Toru Takemitsu and Lowell Liebermann, Carl Reinecke and Paul Taffanel, Sigfrid Karg-Elert and Carl Maria von Weber. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 and $35. (Midgette) MIHAELA URSULEASA (Sunday) This young Romanian-born, Vienna-trained pianist performs a recital of Shostakovich, Scriabin, Beethoven and Brahms. 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700; $20.(Jeremy Eichler) * VIENNA PHILHARMONIC (Tonight through Sunday) Riccardo Muti leads one of the world's premium orchestras in three programs that, conservative as they are, at least put a toe into the last century. Tonight, Hindemith's ''Nobilissima Visione'' Suite and the Schubert Ninth. Tomorrow, Schubert's Fourth and ''Rosamunde'' Overture, Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante and Strauss's ''Death in Transfiguration'' should let listeners revel in the orchestra's uncommonly rich string sound. And on Sunday, Mr. Muti draws on what must seem like spicy exoticism to the Viennese, with Bartok's ''Two Pictures,'' Ravel's ''Rapsodie Espagnole'' and Falla's ''Three-Cornered Hat,'' all preceded by music from the orchestra's home turf, Mozart's ''Haffner'' Symphony. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $58 to $195. (Kozinn) OXANA YABLONSKAYA (Tonight) This forceful Russian-born pianist plays a recital of Chopin, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff and Weinberg, presented by the Chopin Society of New York. 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35.

Wednesday, Thursday and March 11 at 8 p.m.; March 12 at 2 and 7 p.m. Ailey Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/harknessfestival; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) PAPPA TARAHUMARA (Tonight) This performance group makes its New York debut with ''Island,'' a tragic, multidisciplinary adaptation of Gabriel García Márquez's story ''A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings.'' 7:30 p.m., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258 or www.japansociety.org; $30; members, $25. (Kinetz) * LAURA PAWEL DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Pawel and her dancers and musicians, some of them grizzled, longtime presences on the city's modern-dance scene, are content to make and perform small, plain dances about the everyday, often seasoned with wry reminiscences that reveal the everyday as not so ordinary. And their contentment is infectious. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 5 p.m. Dance Forum, 20 East 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 212-633-7202; $15.. (Dunning) CIE. MARTINE PISANI (Tonight through Sunday) From Paris, this modern-dance company will present ''sans,'' which merges comedy and minimalism in the presences and movement styles of three company members. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sunday at 8 p.m. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $20. (Dunning) * REBECCA RICE DANCE (Tomorrow) Ms. Rice comes from an august modern-dance family that includes Carolyn Brown and Marion Rice. In this New York debut, she will present pieces set to music by John Harbison and Elena Ruehr, as well as Bach played live by the cellist Emmanuel Feldman. The Boston reviewer Marcia B. Siegel described her work as drawing from ''the theatricality of Denishawn dance, the extroverted skills of ballet and the physical investment of modern dance.'' Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (978) 852-3863; $20 and $35; $15 for students. (Dunning) PEGGY SPINA TAP (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Spina celebrates 25 years of performing and choreographing tap in a program of dances set to music performed live by the Joel Forrester Quartet. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 6 and 8:30 p.m., Spina Loft, 115 Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 674-8885; $20. (Dunning) * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The company's annual City Center season continues with repertory programs all week. Tonight's offers the New York premiere of ''Banquet of Vultures'' and also includes a revival of ''Oh, You Kid!'' (last seen here in 2001). ''Spring Rounds,'' the other New York premiere, is scheduled for tomorrow night and Tuesday. Other notable revivals for the week will be ''Arabesque'' on Sunday, last seen in 2001; ''Dust'' on Tuesday (1997); ''Brandenburgs'' on Wednesday (1997); and ''Speaking in Tongues'' on Thursday (2002). Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; and Tuesday at 7 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.nycitycenter.org; $15 to $80. (John Rockwell) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. One particularly intense work, based on the belief that Abubakari II, ruler of Mali, crossed the Atlantic nearly 200 years before Columbus to discover the Americas, links the past with the present and Africa with the beloved Columbus of Ms. Robinson's childhood. Her works do not lend themselves to easy deciphering, but her magic with materials and her daring compositional imagination draw you in. Her art rings true. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck) * COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DAVID SMITH: A CENTENNIAL,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF MEDICINE IN ANCIENT EGYPT,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: 'COMBINES,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.)(Nicolai Ouroussoff) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) P.S. 1: JESSICA STOCKHOLDER: 'OF STANDING FLOAT ROOTS IN THIN AIR,' through May 1. A soaring, cannily designed installation -- made of airborne plastic bins, electric lights, orange extension cords and an old armchair topping a wooden tower -- by a sculptor known for orchestrating productive collisions of formalism and consumerism. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Ken Johnson) P.S. 1: RICKY SWALLOW: 'METICULOUS,' through March 20. Extraordinarily realistic and symbolically portentous sculptures carved from wood by Australia's representative to last summer's Venice Biennale, in which three of the five works on view here were included. (See above.) (Johnson) * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Galleries: 57th Street STEPHEN GREENE: 'PLEASURE DOME' In abstract paintings from late in his career, Greene (1917-1999) created shimmering mindscapes in which fiery reds and oranges and electric blues and greens glow through areas of muddy browns and grays. Made with a touch that is sometimes brusque and sometimes exquisitely sensitive, the paintings combine sensuous immediacy and visionary romanticism. Jason McCoy, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 319-1996, through March 11. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea NATALIE FRANK: 'UNVEILING' Still in graduate school (at Columbia) but already the subject of considerable media attention, Ms. Frank paints expansive, Eric Fischl-like pictures in which nude bodies and lavish floral arrangements combine to create anxiously erotic daydreams. Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, (212) 560-9075, through March 11. (Johnson) AMY GRANAT: SCRATCH FILMS/STARS WAY OUT (FOR O.K.) A beautiful installation using three looped projections of manipulated black-and-white film that create an animated but slightly sinister environment of shifting geometric motifs: parallel lines, blocks and spots. It might have been made at almost any time during the last 40 years, but the percussive soundtrack provides a modicum of newness. More is needed. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, through March 11. (Smith) JERRY KEARNS: 'FOREVER MORE' For many years Mr. Kearns has been making illustrative paintings combining Pop-Surrealist style, leftist politics and anti-consumerist social commentary, with humor and obviousness often battling to a draw. His new paintings feature muscle-bound Jesus figures, hysterical hermaphrodites, creepy children, magical birds, fast-food products and heavenly blue skies. Michael Steinberg, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 924-5770, through March 11. (Johnson) JAMES RIECK: 'FLOWER GIRLS' Working from old bridal catalogues, Mr. Rieck paints silvery cropped images of angelic girls wearing white dresses, shoes and gloves. Lyons Wier, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 242-6220, through March 11. (Johnson) MIMI SMITH: 'DRAWINGS FROM THE 60'S TO THE PRESENT' Known for witty feminist sculptures based on women's clothing, Ms. Smith here presents drawings sampling her five-decade career, including a large, three-dimensional paper house covered with fine writing protesting environmental pollution and recent sets of finely made images of shoes and underwear representing stages in a woman's life from infancy to old age. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through March 4. (Johnson) Other Galleries * 'DO YOU THINK I'M DISCO' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * ANYA GALLACCIO: 'ONE ART' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) THE STUDIO VISIT The studio visit, a time-honored ritual that everyone in the art world has both endured and learned from, is taken to its limit in Exit Art's latest exhibition marathon. Each of the 160 mostly short videos represents one artist's idea of, play on, or substitute for, a studio visit. It is a show that often cries out for a fast-forward button, but there are some notable gems -- for example, by Joyce Pensato, Cynthia von Buhler, Ida Applebroog, Bruce Pearson, Lance Wakeling, Taylor McKimens, Paul Wirhun, Elisabeth Kley, Christy Gast and Kim Jones. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 966-7745, through March 25. (Smith) 'ZOO STORY' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson) Last Chance CAITLIN ATKINSON: 'CHAPTERS' Comical and touching staged photographs portray the artist herself in moments of anxiety and disappointment: contemplating a dish of lasagna she burned; apparently abandoned in an empty grocery store parking lot; and starting to disrobe at a nude beach. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) JOE BRADLEY: 'KURGAN WAVES' Large, blocky men assembled from flimsy, brusquely painted canvases seem to have convened for a mysterious tribal ritual in Mr. Bradley's sharp sendup of Minimalist orthodoxy. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, between Hester and Canal Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) CHUCK CLOSE, ANNIE LEIBOVITZ, VIK MUNIZ: 'INVENTIVE FASHION PHOTOGRAPHS' Photographs of the silhouettes of fashion models, shaped in bent wire and based on fashion photographs by Vik Muniz; daguerreotype pictures of a naked Kate Moss; and fashion spreads by Annie Leibovitz based on ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Danziger, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 629-6778, closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closes Sunday. (Glueck) ROBERT S. NEUMAN: 'FIFTY YEARS' With good-humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, closes Monday.. (Johnson) * P.S. 1: 'PETER HUJAR,' When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, closes Monday. (Cotter) * MATT SAUNDERS The work of this young Berlin-based American artist falls midway between Robert Ryman and Andy Warhol in its acute awareness of painting's physical constitution and its love of movie stars and glamour. The slick, illustrational painting style is a big problem, but the use of light, space, film projectors and the moving image (in a hand-drawn animation) has considerable potential. Harris Lieberman, 89 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290, closes tomorrow. (Smith) MACRAE SEMANS This New York debut introduces a promising bricoleur whose sculptures are carefully worked-out vortexes of abject and elegant and found and made that make rich asides to the histories of art and design but need to distinguish themselves from the work of several other artists mining the same vein. Taxter & Spengemann, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 924-0212, closes tomorrow. (Smith) 'SITE 92' The second exhibition in this nonprofit gallery's impressive big, new space presents site-specific works by more than 25 artists. Highlights include a colorful column of hovering butterflies made of candy wrappers by Luisa Caldwell; fanciful architectural elements painted on the wall by Amy Yoes; people imitating the sounds of pigeons in an audio-video work by Beth Krebs; and, by Virginia Poundstone, a tableau representing a satellite that has crashed in the jungle. Smack Mellon, 92 Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761, closes Sunday. (Johnson) 'SPACE BOOMERANG' This darkly theatrical show includes sculptures like Cubist bathtubs by Mike Bouchet; a bicycle with endlessly spinning wheels by Jonathan Monk; a Minimalist wall sculpture dented on purpose by Bruno Peinado; a wall that intermittently vibrates violently by Loris Gréaud; a magical light and smoke sculpture by Ann Veronica Janssens; a video documenting Gianni Motti's walk through a particle accelerator; a motorcycle immersed in the wax of burning candles by Mark Handforth; and a long, sleek wall of black plastic-shaded lights by Lang/Baumann. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, closes Thursday. (Johnson)"

That honor, that challenge, belongs to Jim Larranaga, the lanky youth in the photograph over Curran's shoulder, now a silver-haired coach at George Mason, the shocking outsider at the Final Four."

One answer is being offered at the Playhouse Theater, where ''My Name Is Rachel Corrie'' opened on Thursday night for a commercial London run that is taking the place of the play's suspended New York engagement. Over the next six weeks, theatergoers will discover a production that has matured through three London engagements (the first two, separated by six months, took place last year on the Royal Court's pair of stages), even if the work remains an impassioned eulogy that isn't quite the same thing as a play."
