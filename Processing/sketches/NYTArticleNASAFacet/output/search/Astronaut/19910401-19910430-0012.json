Automatic landings raise the thorny question of whether humans could be eliminated entirely from the craft's operation. In theory, the shuttle could carry some payloads into orbit without the aid of astronauts, reducing the repercussions from a Challenger-type disaster. The odds of catastrophic failure are seen as 1 in 78 missions."

Urban America on prime time's plethora of law-enforcement shows is infested with crime and social problems. Suburbia isn't much better. Television does, in its way, reflect reality. Now, more and more, weekly series are fleeing to out-of-the-way towns and villages. The farther away from a big city, it seems, the better. NBC 's \"Down Home\" (Saturdays at 8:30 P.M.), for instance, takes place down South in a Gulf Coast hamlet. And CBS 's \"Evening Shade\" (Mondays at 8) gets its title from the name of the real Midwestern town that is its setting. And then, also on CBS (Mondays at 10), there is \"Northern Exposure,\" taking us all the way to Cicely, Alaska, population somewhere between 500 and 850, depending on which census you want to believe."
