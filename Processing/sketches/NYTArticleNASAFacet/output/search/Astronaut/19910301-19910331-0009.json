Keating Jr., the savings and loan executive, the panel said Wednesday that there was substantial evidence of wrongdoing by Senator Alan Cranston, and it issued milder reproofs to the other four."

After some review, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's management decided to let the couple fly on the Spacelab mission to which they were assigned before they were married. In 1989 Mr. Lee, a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, and Dr. Davis, an engineer, were assigned to fly on the Endeavour, a new space shuttle scheduled for September 1992. They were married in January. \"There was an unwritten policy not to put husbands and wives on the same flight,\" said BARBARA SCHWARTZ, a NASA spokeswoman. \"This does not change our policy.\" The agency has 79 astronauts and 23 astronaut candidates, including three married couples. Colonel Lee, 38 years old, will be the payload commander on a joint Japanese-American mission, which will have a crew of seven. He made a shuttle flight in 1989, but it would be the first shuttle flight for Dr. Davis, 37, who became an astronaut in 1988."

That study said the space station could be justified with a few modifications to enhance its role of studying humans in space."
