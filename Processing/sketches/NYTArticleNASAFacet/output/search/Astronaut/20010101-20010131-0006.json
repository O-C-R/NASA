The new year is upon us, and there will be no escape from the relentless comparisons between the spacefaring future world we saw in Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' and the reality of our measly earthbound life in the real 2001. We don't yet have a lunar base camp, and we have not yet sent hibernating astronauts to Jupiter in outsized space ships, but we have nonetheless come a long way in our exploration of space. People sometimes wax nostalgic over the golden age of NASA: the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs led to the first moon landing in 1969. But it's a mistake to measure the success of our efforts in space by where footprints have been laid. Nor should we make judgments based on how many people follow the progress of our launches or recall the names of our astronauts."

Where is it going? How long can the trend last? What does it say about our culture? Burnett gazes into the camera like a man surveying his property from a rocking chair on the front porch. This is television, after all, and right now the amiable, supremely confident Burnett seems to be the man holding the deed. Mark Burnett is everywhere these days, which is to be expected for the producer who has changed the way Americans think about television. With ''Survivor,'' Burnett not only pulled in an astonishing 51 million viewers, he also single-handedly rejuvenated CBS. In addition to the sequel, ''Survivor: The Australian Outback'' (which will have its premiere tonight after the Super Bowl on CBS), Burnett is currently producing three other programs, for two other networks. ''Eco-Challenge,'' set to be broadcast in April on the USA cable network, consists of teams of adventure athletes sweating and bleeding, traversing jungles and mountains and caves, in pursuit of a little TV glory and a modest cash prize. In a more militaristic variation on the reality theme, ''Combat Missions,'' also created for USA, features teams of ex-Green Berets, ex-Navy Seals and other elite-force types dropping from helicopters, storming rooftops and braving staged explosions to rescue simulated hostages. The third show, which Burnett has sold to NBC, has the working title ''Destination Mir.'' In this show, the contestant who emerges victorious from the made-for-TV astronaut-training competition wins the opportunity to be strapped inside a Soyuz rocket and blasted into outer space."
