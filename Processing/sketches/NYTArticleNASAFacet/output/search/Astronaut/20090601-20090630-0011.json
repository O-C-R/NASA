The Obama administration announced last month the creation of the panel that would take a ''fresh look'' at NASA's efforts to return to the moon by 2020. The panel will be led by Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of the Lockheed Martin Corporation who also led a major review of NASA in 1990."

Try the inaugural effort from Ilion Animation Studios, an upstart film company in Spain.

On Sept. 23, 1910, Jorge Chávez, a French-Peruvian aviator, became the first man to fly over the Alps, crossing the Simplon Pass from Switzerland to Italy in his Blériot XI monoplane."

Mr. León and his wife made the two-hour trip by train and subway to Corona to meet with one of the two pastors, Gregorio Gonzalez. He told them that all they had to do was to fill out a form and provide $8,000 each in cash and some personal identification documents, Mr. León recalled. The green cards would be ready in a month."

We've been concentrating on the shuttle, the space station and laying the groundwork for returning to the moon. The disturbing part is that, all this time, Russia has been concentrating on Phobos, a moon of Mars, and a number of us have recently realized just how significant that would be as a stepping stone to Mars."

Bean walked on the moon as an Apollo astronaut, but he still wrestles with the experience every day, trying to recapture what he and other astronauts saw and felt in the medium of paint. Becoming a painter has been a long slog for Mr. Bean, who describes himself as a slow learner. He has had to give up the hyper-rational way of seeing the world he had learned as a Navy test pilot and engineer. He has trained himself to see things not as they are but as they feel to him, to translate emotions into colors and to resist his scientific urges."

In this special ''Space Week'' episode, Danny Forster ventures behind the scenes of Mission Control and Cape Canaveral as he examines the Constellation Program, NASA's latest bold foray into the final frontier. The mission: to return to the moon, establish a permanent lunar base and then hop a spacecraft next door to Mars. Mr. Forster looks at the prototype for the new lunar rover; engineering strategies for launching rockets faster and more safely; underwater astronaut training; and preparations for the space shuttle Endeavor's final flights before it is retired after 30 years and more than 100 successful missions. And in what he called ''the coolest boyhood dream to come true thus far in my career,'' Mr. Forster, above right, with the Endeavor, gets to try his hand at piloting the space shuttle inside the official flight simulator. 11 A.M.
