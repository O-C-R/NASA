The Discovery was initially scheduled to make its 39th and final flight last Monday, bearing fresh supplies and an intelligent robot for the International Space Station. But complications delayed the flight from Monday to Friday, when the hydrogen leak led NASA to conclude that the shuttle would not be ready to launch before its flight window closed this Monday."

''Of course circumstances for iconoclastic, bohemian young people in Iran are not what they are elsewhere,'' A. O. Scott wrote in his review in The New York Times, adding that ''both the pathos and the buoyant energy'' of this ''bouncy, seething'' film by Bahman Ghobadi ''come from the sense that Negar, Ashkan and their friends are bravely laying claim to creativity, idealism and free expression in defiance of an authoritarian state that seeks to deny them those universal birthrights of modern youth.'' The film, above, which won a jury award in Cannes, is one of several movies that prompted the Iranian government to announce that it would punish filmmakers who do not obtain approval for their work. ''Productions in Iran are subject to review before being released there,'' The Times reported in December 2009, ''and directors are expected to submit screenplays for approval before beginning shooting, though some ignore the process.'' 8 P.M. (National Geographic) DOG WHISPERER Sunita L. Williams and Leland Melvin met in a NASA astronaut class in 1998 and have each journeyed to the International Space Station. But back on Earth they spend a lot of time trying to manage their problem dogs. Ms. Williams's Jack Russell terrier, Gorby, likes to pick on dogs bigger than he is. Mr. Leland's Rhodesian Ridgeback mix Jake will try to bite anyone who gets near his owner. Cesar Millan comes to the rescue. In ''Squid vs. Whale,'' at 9, marine biologists attach a remote camera to a sperm whale, the largest toothed predator on the planet, as it journeys 1,000 feet below the ocean's surface in the Gulf of California in search of its favorite meal, the colossal squid."

Robert Jones wrote the script and Edmund Coulthard directed the production, which recreates scenes in Lennon's life from 1964 to 1971: the time his separated parents forced him to choose between them; his encounters with his absentee father (Christopher Fairbank); his arguments with Paul McCartney (Andrew Scott); the death of Brian Epstein (Rory Kinnear), the Beatles' manager, from a drug overdose in 1967; Ms. Ono's role in the breakup of the band; and the couple's subsequent self-imposed exile in New York City. 9 A.M.

They were there to run physical tests, or to extract blood from her earlobe, or just to observe and take notes. Kotelko removed her glasses. She wore white New Balance sneakers and black running tights, and over her silver hair, a plastic crown that held in place a breathing tube. Tanja Taivassalo, a 40-year-old muscle physiologist, adjusted the fit of Kotelko's stretch-vest. It was wired with electrodes to measure changes in cardiac output -- a gauge of the power of her heart. Taivassalo first met Kotelko at last year's world outdoor masters track championships in Lahti, Finland, the pinnacle of the competitive season for older tracksters. Taivassalo went to watch her dad compete in the marathon. But she could hardly fail to notice the 91-year-old Canadian, bespandexed and elfin, who was knocking off world record after world record."
