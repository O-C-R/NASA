Hultgreen, 29, was killed in October when her F-14 Tomcat crashed into the sea off San Diego as she was approaching an aircraft carrier for a landing. It was a controversial death: Hultgreen's pioneer position in that male bastion, the Navy, hadn't been achieved without resistance, and the accident raised questions about whether she had been adequately trained. But fellow pilots praised her performance, noting that 10 F-14 aviators have died in accidents since 1992. By Katherine S. Manegold HERS WAS A DREAM denied, then deferred and finally granted, to fly with the elite in a fighter jet so fast, so complex and so advanced that its wings heave back and forth along its glinting body, shifting angles for attack, landing, takeoff and approach, a machine hurtling 35 tons of metal, raw speed and unspent ammunition toward a combat target or a floating landing field called home."

Hold that thought about the -ess suffix as you read this letter from Andrew Hughes of New York: \"When I was young, we had movies that had actors and actresses. Now we seem to have nothing but actors. Even the women are called actors. The word actresses seems to have fallen into disrepute."
