Any attempt to acquire a sense of the quality or vitality of art in the 1980's must therefore be seen in relation to the immensity and variety of the activity itself. We have literally known nothing like it in the past. There are now, first of all, more artists creating more works of art (of some sort) than ever before in our history. There are also more galleries eager to show it, and therefore more exhibitions of it. There is more discussion of it, too, and more study of it, and more money spent on it. And there is, of course, more competition, often very fierce competition - among both artists and their agents - for the kind of high visibility and distinction that will place them above the hustling herd of talents vying for attention and success."
