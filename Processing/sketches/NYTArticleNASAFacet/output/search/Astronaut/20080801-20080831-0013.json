In a ceremony at the Hudson River Museum on July 14, he and Mayor Philip A. Amicone exchanged gifts. The mayor presented Colonel Garan with the key to the city, and Colonel Garan (Roosevelt High School, class of 1979) presented Mr. Amicone with items from Yonkers, including school mementos, that he had taken into space. While touring the museum's current exhibition, ''Space Is the Place,'' Colonel Garan took special interest in paintings by Lia Halloran that show astronautlike figures, and an audio installation, ''Indecision on the Moon,'' by Nina Katchadourian, that replays Neil A. Armstrong's lunar landing, but none of his famous words. Speaking by phone from Houston, Colonel Garan, 46, noted that his mother, Linda Relis, is a wildlife artist in Florida whose naturalistic oil paintings hang in the State House. For that reason, he said, he is more accustomed to ''technically accurate'' than conceptual art. On the other hand, he said, referring to the Yonkers show, ''You can't help but be impressed with some of the creativity.''"

They are invariably package shows, organized elsewhere and brought in to fill a gap in the exhibition program or because of a connection to the community or the museum itself. Since the Hudson River Museum is home to a popular planetarium, it makes sense that it would host a show on space and space exploration. Then there is the added hook that on July 20 the nation observed the 39th anniversary of the first moon landing, by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin."

Kennedy Route: war hero to United States senator to president. Barack Obama is pursuing the Warren G. Harding Route: orator-organizer to United States senator to president. A lawyership, a governorship, a cabinet post, a vice presidency all are common stepping stones to the White House, but not all our chief executives have had such staid, predictable résumés. We have had presidents who were once bank robbers, pirates, devotees of voodoo. We have had a president who was elected, then developed a second career as a ruthless murderer, and then was re-elected. We have even had a president who was previously a first lady. She also logged time as a nun. These commanders in chief were some of our many television presidents. Before they attained the White House, these men and women, or the actors who played them, turned up in all sorts of roles that would never have passed muster with the American people had we had the chance to vet them properly. Film presidents too have their odd backgrounds -- FredricMarch, president in ''Seven Days in May,'' was both Jekyll and Hyde before being elected -- but, modern conventions being TV events, it seems fitting to focus on the small screen. Here are a few of the more bizarre paths that have led to television presidencies. The Gary Sinise Route"
