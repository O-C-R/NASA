      "lead_paragraph": "My favorite way to look at photographs is by leafing through homemade albums. The captions are fanciful, the order is significant, the material is diverse. Good albums communicate a private urgency, and occasionally you even hit on something sinister, as when an ex-wife is conspicuously missing or a blacklisted face has been cropped out. For decades, a growing network of scrappers in America has refined and updated English commonplace books and turned scrapbooking into folk art. My second favorite way of looking at photos is in online slide shows. Slide shows began appearing on news sites like Slate.com a few years ago, before most sites could handle video. Many early slide shows featured runway fashion; you could see dozens of outfits instead of the select handful that might make it into the paper. Now all kinds of subjects get slide-show treatment, with substantial captions. Recently, on the Times site, lucid daylight portraits of people attending the Obama inauguration chronicled the event even better than live footage did. Seen in sequence, each face seemed to reflect a discrete facet of the day's ecstasy, catharsis and anxiety."

      "lead_paragraph": "FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY the eminent physicist Freeman Dyson has quietly resided in Princeton, N.J., on the wooded former farmland that is home to his employer, the Institute for Advanced Study, this country's most rarefied community of scholars. Lately, however, since coming ''out of the closet as far as global warming is concerned,'' as Dyson sometimes puts it, there has been noise all around him. Chat rooms, Web threads, editors' letter boxes and Dyson's own e-mail queue resonate with a thermal current of invective in which Dyson has discovered himself variously described as ''a pompous twit,'' ''a blowhard,'' ''a cesspool of misinformation,'' ''an old coot riding into the sunset'' and, perhaps inevitably, ''a mad scientist.'' Dyson had proposed that whatever inflammations the climate was experiencing might be a good thing because carbon dioxide helps plants of all kinds grow. Then he added the caveat that if CO2 levels soared too high, they could be soothed by the mass cultivation of specially bred ''carbon-eating trees,'' whereupon the University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner looked through the thick grove of honorary degrees Dyson has been awarded -- there are 21 from universities like Georgetown, Princeton and Oxford -- and suggested that ''perhaps trees can also be designed so that they can give directions to lost hikers.'' Dyson's son, George, a technology historian, says his father's views have cooled friendships, while many others have concluded that time has cost Dyson something else. There is the suspicion that, at age 85, a great scientist of the 20th century is no longer just far out, he is far gone -- out of his beautiful mind. But in the considered opinion of the neurologist Oliver Sacks, Dyson's friend and fellow English expatriate, this is far from the case. ''His mind is still so open and flexible,'' Sacks says. Which makes Dyson something far more formidable than just the latest peevish right-wing climate-change denier. Dyson is a scientist whose intelligence is revered by other scientists -- William Press, former deputy director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and now a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, calls him ''infinitely smart.'' Dyson -- a mathematics prodigy who came to this country at 23 and right away contributed seminal work to physics by unifying quantum and electrodynamic theory -- not only did path-breaking science of his own; he also witnessed the development of modern physics, thinking alongside most of the luminous figures of the age, including Einstein, Richard Feynman, Niels Bohr, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Witten, the ''high priest of string theory'' whose office at the institute is just across the hall from Dyson's. Yet instead of hewing to that fundamental field, Dyson chose to pursue broader and more unusual pursuits than most physicists -- and has lived a more original life."
