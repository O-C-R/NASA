There, firefighters attached to the 177th Wing will get the astronauts out in a hurry. Tech. Sgt. Joseph Bannon, one of those firefighters, talked about the rescue plans. Q. Why did NASA choose the base at Atlantic City National International Airport?"

In fact, I've used whatever new and clever technology I can, including digital photographs sent via e-mail and birthday notes faxed from airplanes, to try to make up for the fact that I periodically travel for my Asian private-equity business for weeks at a time. I miss my family a lot, particularly because Noa is at the stage in which important things happen every day -- new words, first steps, leaps of understanding."

I'd heard the song on the radio before, of course; however, coming as it did, not from Mr. Bowie but from a choir of elementary school kids in a remote farm community in northern Canada, this was something new. Orchestrated in the late 1970's by a hippie music teacher named Hans Fenger, the scratchy recording sounded like a document of a clandestine event, as if Mr. Bowie's song had been co-opted for a cult ceremony. The instrumentation included electric guitar and the gamelan-like chimes invented for children by the composer Carl Orff. The lyric of the song's wayward astronaut, ''For here/ Am I sitting in my tin can/ Far above the moon,'' never resonated so genuinely."
