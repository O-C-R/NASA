Captain McCandless and Colonel Stewart used 300-pound nitrogen-propelled backpacks known as manned maneuvering units to make their way through space. The men made two spacewalks during the mission, the second occurring on Feb. 9. The first lasted 5 hours 55 minutes and the second was 6 hours 17 minutes."
