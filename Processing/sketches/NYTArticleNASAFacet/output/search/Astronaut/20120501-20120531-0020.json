(13) FAUST Des McAnuff, the artistic director of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, whose revival of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' is now on Broadway, makes his Metropolitan Opera debut with Gounod's ''Faust,'' updated to the 20th century. Jonas Kaufmann stars as a nuclear scientist, despairing of the effects of his life's work, who makes a contract with the Devil. Marina Poplavskaya, above with Mr. Kaufmann, is Marguerite, Faust's love interest and eventual victim, and René Pape reprises his role as Méphistophélès. Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducted this ''Great Performances at the Met'' presentation, which was shown live in movie theaters on Dec. 10. ''It is better if a production does not look too deeply for elements of existential despair that are simply not in the piece, and that seems the problem with the new 'Faust,' '' Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times, adding that this co-production with the English National Opera, ''though rich with ideas and theatrically daring, is finally rather clinical and oppressive.'' 7:45 A.M. (IFC) AWAY FROM HER (2007) Fiona and Grant, a long-married couple played by Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent, confront Alzheimer's disease in the feature directorial debut of Sarah Polley, who earned an Oscar nomination for her screenplay, based on an Alice Munro short story. ''There is, in Ms. Munro's mature work, a flinty wisdom about heterosexual love, a skepticism about romantic ideals that does not altogether deny their power or necessity,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ''Ms. Polley, rather remarkably for someone still in her 20s, shows an intuitive grasp of this wisdom and a welcome, unsentimental interest in the puzzles and pleasures of a long, imperfect marriage.'' He added, ''I can't remember the last time the movies yielded up a love story so painful, so tender and so true.''"

Cameras, both still and video, had already been set up and there was a circle of chairs waiting, but they made sure they had all hugged and welcomed each other before taking a seat. There was very little tension and subtext as they settled in, much more of it when the recorder came on, and then none of it once they had finished. The Wainwrights and Roches know how to reveal just enough conflict to make for an interesting interview, but nothing that creates lasting grudges. When the group interview was done, three generations, siblings and half-siblings, grandpa and shy grandchild, all began weighing in on where the gigantic crew might eat. This is a family that likes and loves each other very much, even if they don't always pretend to get along. Below are some additional edited excerpts from the interview."

''This is a packed house,'' Mr. Obama remarked, ''which is a testament to how cool this group is.'' The other recipients of the nation's highest civilian honor were former secretary of state Madeleine Albright; John Doar, assistant attorney general of the civil rights era; William Foege, a physician who worked to eradicate smallpox; John Glenn, astronaut and senator; Dolores Huerta, a founder of the farm workers union; the writer Toni Morrison; the Israeli leader Shimon Peres; John Paul Stevens, retired Justice of the Supreme Court; Pat Summitt, the top college women's basketball coach who now speaks on Alzheimer's disease; and, all posthumously, Gordon Hirabayashi, who challenged the wartime internment of Japanese Americans; Jan Karski, a member of the Polish underground who exposed Nazi atrocities, and Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
