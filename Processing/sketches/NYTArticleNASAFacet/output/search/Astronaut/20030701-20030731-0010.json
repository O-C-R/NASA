Every year, the summer sun heats the inland desert to the east, the hot air climbs, the sea breeze builds and the kites rise over Gaza. Made from colored tissue paper or the folded pages of last year's homework, they are flecks of white, red or green against an invariably blue sky. Their taut, curving strings lead as invariably to the hands of children, backing, pausing and backing again toward the sea, into the wind, upturned faces a study in transported concentration."

Mercedes-Benz doesn't need to -- in the 117 years since Karl Benz built his Patent Motorwagen, the company has nurtured one of the best-known brands on the planet. Isn't it odd, then, that the company's new flagship isnt called a Mercedes? You will not find the company's three-pointed star, a symbol recognized from Beverly Hills to Bhutan, anywhere on its exterior. The 2004 Maybach is Mercedes's new foray into the world of ultraluxury, a rarefied realm of $12,000-a-night presidential suites, $15,000 umbrella stands and $20 million trips into the heavens. Indeed, Dennis A. Tito, the pay-to-play astronaut who hitched a ride with the Russians to the space station two years ago, has ordered a Maybach from the dealer here."

Since it was launched in 1990 with a flawed mirror and then repaired by spacewalking astronauts, the Hubble, floating above the murky atmosphere, has been a matchless time machine, providing astronomers with views of unprecedented clarity deep into space and time.
