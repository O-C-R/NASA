Then Johnny Depp appeared on screen in Gore Verbinski's PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003), and all bets were off. There's a kidnapping and a cursed pirate crew who turn into skeletons in the moonlight, but the show belongs to Mr. Depp's character, Capt. Jack Sparrow, a pirate with rock-star style and a well-developed sense of self. Early on, he saves the governor's daughter (Keira Knightley), who has fallen off a cliff during an unwelcome marriage proposal. The ungrateful proposer, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), tells Sparrow, ''You are without a doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of.'' Sparrow replies, ''But you have heard of me'' -- Saturday at 9 p.m. on Starz. You have to say one thing for Max Schreck in NOSFERATU (1922), F. W. Murnau's vampire classic. He knows how to play undead. As creepy as Willem Dafoe was, playing Schreck in ''Shadow of the Vampire,'' about the making of this German silent, he's a grade-school trick-or-treater compared with the real thing. Count Orlok (Schreck) wants to buy a house in the town of Wisborg, and Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is the unlucky real estate agent assigned to go to Transylvania to arrange the sale. ''Travel quickly, travel well, young friend, to the country of ghosts,'' says his boss. Orlok is so brazen that he marches right into town carrying his coffin. Before you can say black plague, the citizens of Wisborg are dropping like flies -- Sunday at midnight on TCM."

      "lead_paragraph": "Like a caged hamster, Senator John Kerry is restless on the road. He pokes at the perimeter of the campaign bubble that envelops him, constantly trying to break out for a walk around the block, a restaurant dinner, the latest movie. Landing one sunny day in St. Louis, Mr. Kerry wandered off the airstrip to stroll through a grass patch, leaving his security detail trying to keep him in sight while scores of staff members, supporters, police officers and journalists waited without explanation for an hour. Another afternoon on another tarmac, he tossed a baseball, then a football, then hopped on a policeman's motorcycle for a spin, all in the space of 30 minutes. Late one evening in Harrisburg, Pa., Mr. Kerry jumped from the motorcade to greet some children on a street corner."
