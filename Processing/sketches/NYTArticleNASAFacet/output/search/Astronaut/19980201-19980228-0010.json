It is a steaming, hyper-air-conditioned, boom-bust-boom town that oozes across 500 relentlessly flat, bayou-laced square miles, the most ethnically and racially diverse, most unionized city in all of Texas, with aching disparities between rich and poor matched in few other places in the country. It is the city that oil built. Houston was nothing much until the first gusher came in; that was Spindletop, on the Gulf coast, which blasted Houston and Texas and the whole blessed world into the era of petroleum on Jan. 10, 1901. Since then, Houston has been a city of flamboyant oilmen like Glenn McCarthy and Hugh Roy Cullen, a city of big gestures and big spenders and bigger hair, where minimalism is a dirty word and nobody would dream of dressing down."
