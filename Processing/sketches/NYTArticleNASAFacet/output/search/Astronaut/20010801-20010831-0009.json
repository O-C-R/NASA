Now Playing * ''A.I.,'' starring Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, William Hurt and Sam Robards. Written and directed by Steven Spielberg (PG-13, 140 minutes). Mr. Spielberg's new film, a project he inherited from Stanley Kubrick, to whom it is dedicated, is a work of brilliant artifice and profound intelligence. Mr. Osment plays a robot, programmed with the capacity to love, who is sent to live with a couple grieving for their comatose, gravely ill son. The movie's three distinct sections reveal an unsettlingly plausible vision of the future and explore a rich, complex set of emotions and ideas. Mr. Spielberg accomplishes the improbable feat of melding Kubrick's chilly, analytical style with his own warmer, needier sensibility, and the result is an exquisitely layered movie -- the riskiest, most ambiguous, most intellectually challenging fairy tale the director has made to date (A. O. Scott)."

The channel wasn't really doing anything anyone outside the hermetic world of science fiction cared about.
