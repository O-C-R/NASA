Some of Mr. McCain's responses to questions about issues that have been prominent in the press for the past few weeks came across as sarcastic - sometimes testy. Furthermore, the Iowa newspaper put his interview with the editorial board online, leaving him vulnerable to unflattering mash-ups."

Eventually, one day, if all went well, some sort of custom arena would be constructed. On Mars. ''There's a bonus,'' said the game's promoter, Ken Harvey, speaking to an attentive audience of National Aeronautics and Space Administration engineers, technicians and scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center here recently, ''where you have to pick up a person holding a certain ball and throw them through a hoop as a sort of extra point.''"
