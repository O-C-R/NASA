The eight weeklong camp sessions are continuing throughout the summer. Seventy-five youngsters 12 through 14 years old spend the week in astronaut training at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center, where astronauts trained, and at the Alabama Space and Rocket Center, a state-run museum. They wear space suits, sample the freeze-dried food eaten in space and experience weightlessness. They are housed on the campus of the University of Alabama at Huntsville."

Hartsfield Jr., then fired rockets to raise the spaceship's orbit and put it on course for a scheduled landing Sunday at 12:09 P.M., New York time. President Reagan is expected to be at Edwards Air Force Base in California for the conclusion of the Columbia's fourth and final test flight. The second shuttle, in a planned fleet of at least four, was towed to the California base today from its assembly plant in Palmdale, Calif. The new vehicle, named Challenger, is scheduled to be flown piggyback on a Boeing 747 from Edwards to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida early next week. Its space debut is set for next January."

Its fourth evaluation flight, which mission controllers called the ''cleanest'' of the program, had demonstrated the military and commercial hybrid that now characterizes America's presence in space. Shortly after leaving on time from Cape Canaveral last Sunday, the shuttle experienced the kind of malfunction that raises questions about the system's economic viability, if not its technical perfection. Two booster rockets valued at $25 million each, which were designed for refurbishment as a cost-saving measure, plunged to the bottom of the ocean after their parachutes failed. When added to the approximately $12 million price of the external fuel tank sloughed off at the end of the orbiter's ascent, this meant that the ''reusable'' shuttle expended at least $62 million worth of hardware during launch. NASA officials did not expect the booster accident to delay future missions, but the agency is under heavy pressure to make the shuttle economical."

For 12 hours a day, his world is the acrid environment of an editing room, where rolls of film twisting back and forth always leave a slightly burnt smell in the air. It is Mr. Farr's job to braid old newsreels, National Aeronautics and Space Administration film of the astronauts, historical moments and the newly minted reality of actors playing the astronauts into ''The Right Stuff'' - the Ladd Company's $17 million movie about the first Americans in space which is due to open next spring. Although television has occasionally attempted something similar, this movie from Tom Wolfe's best-selling book is singular for a film in the age of real events with close-up shots by a Hollywood director in technical as well as dramatic terms. To Leave Audiences Shaken An average 1-hour-54-minute movie contains approximately 10,000 feet of film. Stacked in bins on the walls of the cavernous former cannery that is ''The Right Stuff's'' headquarters are 600 fat rolls of stock footage - 500,000 feet of reality from the past. To get the 500,000 feet, Mr. Farr looked at ''hundreds of miles of film'' at the National Archives in Washington and at ''at least one million of NASA's nine million feet of film.''"
