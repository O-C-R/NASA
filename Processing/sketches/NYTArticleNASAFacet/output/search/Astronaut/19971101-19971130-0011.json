Farther from Sydney than from Jakarta, Perth is one of the world's most isolated major cities, and while it's smaller than Sydney and Melbourne, it's growing faster than either. It is the capital of the gargantuan state of Western Australia, three times the size of Texas. Most of the state's two million inhabitants live in and around the city. In 1962 Perth achieved global renown as a beacon for the astronaut John Glenn: to help him get his bearings while in orbit, citizens switched on every light. He called it the City of Lights. Perth is also a city of white boats, black swans, magnificent beaches along the Sunset Coast of the Indian Ocean and 8,000 species of wildflower -- from orchids and everlastings to kangaroo paws. And now that spring has come to the Southern Hemisphere, they are in bloom. Kings Park, a leisurely walk from Perth's center, is one place to see them, but because of the Los Angeles-like climate, everybody's garden blazes with flowers all year. Spring temperatures are balmy -- in the 70's and 80's -- but Perth rivals Chicago when it comes to wind."

I could have resorted to the usually recommended seasonlong drenching of my trees with pesticides to kill every insect and fungus. But I researched potential problems to see how little, if any, pesticide I could use and still harvest an acceptable crop of high-quality apples. Though pest damage can result in little or no edible fruit, actually only a few pests cause most of the damage."

But now millions of Turks are claiming that he was also a more brilliant scientist than Einstein and a better singer than Elvis. Ataturk, who died in 1938, is worshiped here as a near-deity by the great majority of Turks who see him as a symbol of this country's Western and secular principles. The latest frenzy of adulation, however, has pushed him to a new level."

But Kirk, Spock and Bones were becoming real heroes of the 23d century, and this one, too. They are heroes still, as are Picard and Sisko and now Janeway, commanders of a Federation starship maintaining course through a fourth decade, a fourth television incarnation, eight movies (a ninth is on the way) and deeper into popular culture, if that is possible. Their exploration of the galaxy, now a 24th-century phenomenon, is 350 episodes along, with no end in sight. It's as if science fiction had finally come up with a perpetual-entertainment machine."
