(Cinemax) THE ASTRONAUT FARMER (2007) Fly me to the moon: Billy Bob Thornton, left, plays Charles Farmer, a space-obsessed rancher who builds a rocket in his barn and plans to blast himself into orbit. Virginia Madsen is Audie, the adoring wife who supports his far-flung dreams long after a more sensible woman would have left. Not so enchanted with Farmer's scheme: the Federal Aviation Administration, the F.B.I. and NASA. The film's director, Michael Polish, demonstrates a ''taste for odd, resonant images,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. ''The opening shots, of Farmer on horseback in his space suit, hint at a strangeness that the rest of the movie never quite lives up to, but it does have a visual freshness that makes the bromides and clich√©s palatable.'' 8 P.M. (Animal Planet, Discovery) AKC/EUKANUBA NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 2008 More than 2,400 dogs from across the country compete for titles and $225,000 in prize money at this seventh annual competition held in Long Beach, Calif. Bob Goen is host, assisted by Lee Arnold, a dog show veteran, and Edd Bivin, an American Kennel Club judge; Leanza Cornett interviews owners, handlers and even a few dogs."

The following year New York's Museum of Modern Art staged ''Latin American Artists of the 20th Century,'' a landmark event for the exposure of Cuban artists. Among them was Jos√© Bedia, who is also in the compelling show ''Cuba: Artists Experience Their Country,'' now at the Hunterdon Museum of Art. Mr. Bedia, who was 34 in 1993, painted outsize outline drawings of mythical figures influenced by African, Afro-Cuban and Native American religions and cosmology. Spirituality is still a part of his work, though after leaving Cuba for Mexico in 1993 he began making symbolic drawings that reflect on contemporary life, history and culture in his homeland. On display here is his drawing ''Isla Cimarrona'' (1994), a rough representation of Cuba as a dangerous and forbidding place. (Cimarr√≥n means wild in Spanish.)"

In an interview from the International Space Station on Friday via satellite, an American astronaut, Daniel M. Tani, right, said he and his crew members ''actually watch the 'NBC Nightly News.' '' Mr. Tani was responding to a question from an NBC correspondent, Tom Costello, about how the space station crew stays current on world events. The network said that Mr. Costello had been unaware that NASA regularly transmits podcasts of ''Nightly News'' (minus commercials) to the space station. The astronauts also receive news updates from The Houston Chronicle, one of NASA's hometown newspapers. Brett Holey, director of ''Nightly News,'' said NBC began making the program available to the space station in early 2006. It did so, he said, after a ''psychological support scientist'' for NASA suggested the transmission as a way to ease isolation."

He wrote to President Lyndon Johnson to say that his troops were miserable, desperate for kimchi, the fermented cabbage dish that Koreans savor with almost every meal. Chung Il-kwon, then the prime minister, delivered the letter to Washington. When he traveled overseas, he told Johnson, he longed for kimchi more than for his wife. The president acquiesced, financing the delivery of canned kimchi to the battlefield."
