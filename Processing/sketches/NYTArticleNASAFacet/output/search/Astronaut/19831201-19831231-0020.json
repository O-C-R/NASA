      "lead_paragraph": "Let's get one thing straight immediately: James L. Brooks's ''Terms of Endearment'' is not a perfect movie. This comedy about a middle-class Texas widow, her daughter and their respective lovers sort of meanders around a plot that covers approximately 30 years. It contains one more fatal illness than you may want to witness, and every now and then Mr. Brooks's sit-com background (''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ''Rhoda,'' ''Lou Grant,'' Taxi,'' etc.) is apparent in the film's inability to resist a fast response that may not be entirely in character with the person responding. All of this, however, is beside the point. ''Terms of Endearment'' must be one of the most engaging films of the year, to be cherished as much for the low-pressure way in which it operates (no mammoth star egos to contend with, no major themes to intimidate) as for the fact that it contains what are possibly the best performances ever given by Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson."

The bus-sized cannister, chockablock with experiments, sent a torrent of data back to earth. ''Columbia is America's dream - if that dream doesn't work, ours won't either,'' the director of Spacelab's prime contractor in West Germany said in 1981. At week's end, the mission had developed a few kinks - the film jammed in a special mapping camera and an electron gun failed - but things were still going well enough to help heal some of the diplomatic wounds caused by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's long struggle with shuttle development. West Germans picked up more than half of Spacelab's cost and also placed a Stuttgart physicist on board this premier flight."

By Robert Lindsey ARKNESS IS GIVing way to dawn as a tall, gaunt man crosses Massachusetts Avenue a few blocks from the United States Capitol. He stops at a public park, lies down on the grass, stretches for several minutes, rolls over and stands on his head. A black poodle, unleashed and curious, runs over and sniffs at the upside-down man who wants to be President of the United States. But the man ignores the dog, and after a while it wanders away. The man gets up and walks toward a dirt path near the edge of the park. After a moment, there's a perceptible quickening of his stride, a pause, and then he starts to run. Soon he is sprinting down the track with startling speed and energy for a man of 69, his head held erect and his arms pumping back and forth like levers on a machine. After running about 150 yards, he pulls up at an invisible finish line, walks back and does it again - not once, but three times."

The Iowa caucuses, birthing-rite for Jimmy Carter in 1976 though not for George Bush in 1980, have become a major source of publicity and income for the state. Witness the fact that the Iowa Democratic Party has scheduled a media seminar next week to explain to reporters how to cover the caucuses, which will be held Feb. 20 if the Democratic National Committee consents to that date, which it has not. Journalists who go to Des Moines Dec. 15 will receive lectures on state political history, including one called ''Why Iowa Should Be First,'' observe a mock caucus and walk through the tabulation center that will reveal the caucus victors. Tuition for the seminar, to cover ''a noon banquet, conference refreshments and all conference materials,'' is $20 for out-of-state reporters and $10 for Iowans. Native newsmen, it would appear, eat and drink less than outlanders."

One more of the several equipment malfunctions of the earth-orbiting mission had been overcome, and the scientists aboard the shuttle's Spacelab resumed taking high-resolution pictures in a test of the potential of making maps from space. Much of the photography was of Western Europe. Mission officials described Dr. Parker as the shuttle's ''repairman extraordinaire.'' Several days ago, he used a screwdriver to fix the reel of a high-speed data recorder, restoring a capability to store vast amounts of scientific data collected when the Columbia is out of range of the tracking satellite that is its primary communication link to earth."

They worked shoulder to shoulder, or so it seemed, and yet they were thousands of miles apart in distinctly different fields of gravity. Their experiment and their methods typified a new way of conducting scientific research in a new kind of laboratory beyond the earth in the endlessly mysterious environment of space. Ulf Merbold, a West German physicist, was the one actually in space. He floated in the virtual absence of gravity inside the earth-orbiting Spacelab, the large research facility in the space shuttle Columbia's cargo bay. His attention was focused on the fluid- physics module in a cabinet positioned almost exactly at the spaceship's center of mass. None of the other five crewmen were stirring, so as not to disturb the experiment with any vibrations. John F. Padday, a British physicist, was rooted to earth's gravity in the Payload Operations Control Center here at the Johnson Space Center. He sat at a coffee table in one of the six scientists' rooms off the main control room. Spread before him on the table were his experiment-procedures book, a plastic model of the test equipment, a small calculator and a tape recorder, which he calls his ''electronic notebook.''"

They also confirmed that the manned Salyut 7 orbital laboratory had a fuel leak about the same time that required the shutdown of part of the craft's maneuvering system. Both problems had been previously reported by United States intelligence officials who monitor Soviet space flights. Confirmation of the difficulties came in response to questions by Western reporters at a press conference attended by Vladimir A. Lyakhov and Aleksandr P. Aleksandrov, the crewmen who completed a 150- day flight aboard Salyut 7 on Nov. 23."

For nearly an hour the Ohio Democrat stood there, signing pamphlets, bumper stickers, scraps of paper, even napkins. It was, like many of the groups he has met in his quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination, his crowd. At the end of a year in which many political professionals believe that former Vice President Walter F. Mondale has all but assured himself of winning the nomination, Mr. Glenn's advisers insist they still have the candidate with the broadest political appeal and the best chance of defeating Ronald Reagan next November, should the President run."

A review of the novel in the current issue of the monthly literary magazine Nash Sovremennik calls it dishonest and immoral and says that it should never have been published. The book first appeared in the literary magazine Novy Mir early last year, and has been published as a paperback with a printing of nearly 2.5 million copies.

GLENN: I think there are two things right now that are most important. Of course, the one that overrides everything else is the question in people's minds as to whether we are drifting closer to war or to peace; what is our trend at the moment? Most people are very disturbed about this Administration, the Reagan Administration, and what they believe is a drift more toward the direction of hostilities than toward peace. With that regard, I have been putting forward for some time now a five-point arms control program that I think is doable. I think it's necessary, and I think it's in more detail than either the President or any of my competitors for this nomination on the Democratic side have proposed. It's a method of getting limitations, and moving on to reducing nuclear weapons, in forcing nuclear nonproliferation, of which I was the principal author of that law that was passed back in 1978, because it will do us little good to get control of nuclear weapons between ourselves and the Soviets if we find a dozen other nations have, in the meantime, received nuclear weapons capability. Q. What are the five points?"

      "lead_paragraph": "Productivity up, investment up, retail sales up, the inflation rate down, the stock market bullish - such were the signs of the nation's economic recovery of 1983. But there was a cloud in the picture: a $200 billion Federal deficit. Moreover, the recovery did not spread its benefits uniformly over every part of the economy. Prosperous farmers continued to do well with the help of large Government subsidies, but for many smaller farmers the burden of high interest led to foreclosures. Unemployment, down from its peak in the recession, remained high by historic standards as the nation struggled with its shift from heavy industry to high technology, from factories that employed many unskilled workers to plants that required fewer and more skilled workers."
