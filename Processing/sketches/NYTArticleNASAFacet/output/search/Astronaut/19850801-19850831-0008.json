Acton, a solar physicist aboard the shuttle, after mission controllers told him that a balky telescope in the payload bay had, after several false starts, locked on the sun for the first time. Col. Roy D. Bridges Jr. of the Air Force, the shuttle's pilot, watched the sun's image on a television set. ''There's a lot of joy on the flight deck,'' he reported."

Then, after a series of fancy flying maneuvers 190 miles above the earth, they plucked the satellite from space with the shuttle's 50-foot mechanican arm. The drum-shaped, $5 million satellite, the Plasma Diagnostics Package, studied the electrical effects the shuttle has as it moves, boatlike, through the electrically charged gases of ionosphere, the area extending from 40 to 600 miles above the earth. ''One of our goals is to understand the aurora,'' said Dr. Louis Frank, the scientist at Mission Control in Houston who is in charge of the project. ''No other planets, so far as we know, have aurora as fascinating as earth's.''"

The account by the official, Konstantin Feoktistov, in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda, confirmed earlier Western reports that the Soviet astronauts had revived the unmanned Salyut 7 space station, which was crippled sometime last winter by a electrical failure. Western space experts said the Pravda article was the first Soviet acknowledgment of the electrical failure. Because of the power failure, the astronauts in their Soyuz T-13 spacecraft were forced to make a rare unassisted docking with the space station, relying on visual clues instead of on the automatic electronic radar pulses exchanged between the two craft. The risky approach took 50 hours, and when the astronauts went aboard they found the space station's instruments, food and water supplies frozen. After 10 days of work, the 47-ton ship was thawed and its systems were returned to normal."

They were united as weekend astronauts in a session at the United States Space Camp. Jeffrey Frank, a 29-year-old lawyer from Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., was one. He has been interested in space travel since he was 5, when his father got him a cardboard model of a Mercury capsule. When he was 12, he spent a year turning the bathroom in his bedroom into a copy of an Apollo Command Module. With two friends and a 32-page flight plan, he said he spent 34 hours locked in the room on a make-believe mission to the moon."

Plans to deal with such contingencies have long been in place, but they have recently come into focus because of the shutdown of one the shuttle Challenger's three main rocket engines shortly after its last launching. It was the first such shutdown in the American space program, and it occurred within 33 seconds of the time rescue teams would have had to go into action. This week the rescue crews are fanning out from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, ready in the event they are needed after the launching of the shuttle Discovery from the center next Saturday. Team members head for such places as Spain and Senegal where, at various foreign airports, they practice their skills with firefighters and medics."

After two postponements in three days because of bad weather and a computer failure, the Discovery barely got off the ground before the darkening clouds moved over the launching pad and the rain descended in torrents. Trouble then seemed to follow the five astronauts into space. A malfunction encountered two hours into the flight forced the astronauts to deploy one of the three satellites in the cargo bay a day early. This was Aussat 1, Australia's first communications satellite, which was successfully released into orbit at 1:33 P.M. Eastern daylight time."
