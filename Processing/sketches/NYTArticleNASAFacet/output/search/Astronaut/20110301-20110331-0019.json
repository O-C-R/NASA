I was young, and California certainly felt young. I remember waking up one morning to hear the 40- year-old governor's voice booming from my radio, declaring his intention to ''protect the earth, serve the people, and explore the universe.'' I wasn't prepared for Gov. Jerry Brown. Seminary and law-school trained, Brown eschewed the trappings associated with administering America's most populous state, and one of the world's largest economies. He drove to work in a Plymouth sedan, and he didn't live in the governor's mansion. Stewart Brand, the creator of the Whole Earth Catalog, was a key adviser, and Linda Ronstadt, the Jenny Lind of the Golden West, was a storied girlfriend."

It is difficult -- as the earth still trembles with aftershocks, the numbers of victims keep rising, and the risk of meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power facilities becomes frighteningly plausible -- to draw any conclusive lessons from one of the greatest natural disasters ever to hit this country. It may take months, if not years, for survivors to regroup and start anew. But the prime minister was right in believing that this challenge may well extract unprecedented responses from Japan."
