These sons and daughters of the working class paid $500 a plate for the pleasure, more than their entire college educations had cost them (books and subway tokens included). The evening was a tribute to the astonishing achievement of a college that has become legendary as a proletarian Harvard. At one table sat five of the college's eight Nobel Prize winners, and at other tables were real estate magnates, Wall Street financiers, mayors, judges and newspaper editors. There was a film that showed off such graduates as Felix Frankfurter, Upton Sinclair, Bernard Malamud and Ira Gershwin. And the featured speaker was Gen. Colin L. Powell, Class of 1958, the hero of the Persian Gulf War whose military career was spawned in the college's early-morning R.O.T.C. drills."

Aurora tends to her following of friends and admirers and the three adult children of the deceased Emma (Debra Winger in the first film). Such is Aurora's appeal that she attracts a young therapist (Bill Pullman) and inspires encomiums from the former astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), who resurfaces in a sequel that is ''wayward and needless'' (Maslin)."

Mr. Mobutu took his family to his hometown and then, reportedly, on to Morocco. His Information Minister said that Mr. Mobutu remained President but had ''ceased to intervene'' in the affairs of state. 1 Some people played golf as Kinshasa awaited the arrival of Zaire's rebel army with surprising nonchalance. 6 Blair Opens Door to Sinn Fein Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said he would allow British officials to resume contact with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. Mr. Blair, visiting Belfast, said that renewing official contact depended on an absence of I.R.A. violence, although he did not specifically call for a cease-fire. Sinn Fein's No. 2 official, Martin McGuinness, said his party would accept Mr. Blair's offer. 1 De Klerk Will Shun Inquiry Former President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa ended his National Party's cooperation with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, hobbling its effort to heal deep divisions over past atrocities. Panel members, particularly Archbishop Desmond Tutu. had criticized Mr. de Klerk's recent testimony as lacking credibility. 3 Mexican Prosecutor Arrested Authorities in Spain have arrested Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, Mexico's former top prosecutor. Mr. Chapa disappeared after being charged with rigging evidence in a murder case involving Mexico's political establishment. He was accused of trying to frame Raul Salinas, the brother of Mexico's former President, by planting bones on his ranch. 4 Stalemate in Middle East Dennis Ross ended a nine-day visit to the Middle East, where he is President Clinton's special envoy, with no progress to report in talks between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli planes attacked suspected bases of the Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, avenging the killing of three Israeli soldiers there. 5 Riots in Port-au-Prince Mobs burned cars and exchanged gunfire with police officers in the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, as student demonstrations flared into a day of general rioting. Businesses closed, and downtown residents fled as the rioters hurled rocks. Five people were seriously injured. The rioting was triggered by a teachers' strike. (AP) No Visas for Hong Kong Visits In a move to maintain Hong Kong as a global business and tourism hub, China has announced that foreigners who now travel to the territory without visas may continue to do so after July 1, when the colony reverts to Chinese rule. The Foreign Ministry said Hong Kong's postcolonial Government would decide on which countries' nationals would have the right to enter without visas. They would still be required to travel to other parts of China. (AP) NATIONAL 8-11 House Committee Passes Outline of the Budget Plan The House Budget Committee approved a resolution that will serve as a guide for future action on tax cuts and spending under the balanced-budget agreement. Republican leaders said they expected both the House and the Senate would give final approval by the end of next week. 9 Apology for Syphilis Study President Clinton apologized to the survivors and to relatives of 399 black men whose syphilis was left untreated for decades as part of a Federal study. 10 Abortion Vote May Change Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said he might reverse his stand and vote for a ban on what abortion opponents call ''partial-birth abortion.'' If he did, the Senate would be more likely to override an expected veto by President Clinton of the ban. 11 No Delay for Pilot's Trial The judge in the court-martial of the nation's first female B-52 pilot denied a defense request to delay her trial on adultery and other charges for two weeks. The court-martial of First Lieut. Kelly Flinn is expected to start on Tuesday. 10 Governor's Trial Starts A Federal prosecutor told jurors on the opening day of the fraud trial of Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona that Mr. Symington tried to save his crumbling real estate business through a web of deceit. A defense lawyer said his client had taken risks but never lied. 8 Shuttle Docks With Mir The space shuttle Atlantis docked with the Russian orbiting station Mir, carrying an astronaut who will join the Russian crew and equipment needed to insure that they have breathable air. 10 Explosion for Plane Safety Aviation experts will detonate four small explosions in a Boeing 747 to test reinforced cargo holds and baggage containers. The test will take place in England on Saturday. 8 NEW YORK/REGION 21-25 Fugitive Author Arrested After Motel Suicide Threat A romance novelist who fled from New York after being convicted of stealing a Picasso sketch and other valuables in 1995, was arrested at a California motel. The writer, Barbara Joslyn, stabbed herself in the chest after police officers came to her room to apprehend her. 21 Doctor to Begin Jail Term Dr. Gerald Einaugler, who delayed having a nursing home patient hospitalized after he made a potentially fatal treatment mistake, is about to go to jail, after four years of court battles. He was convicted of criminal negligence and violation of state health laws, and was sentenced to a year of weekends at Rikers Island, although state medical officials declined to discipline him. 23 Danish Mother Is Cleared Charges were dismissed against a Danish tourist who was arrested for leaving her baby in a stroller outside a Manhattan restaurant where she was eating. But charges against the father, who is a New Yorker, remain. The woman had said that Danes commonly leave toddlers on the sidewalk while shopping or eating. 23 Bruno Shifts Rent Stance Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader of the New York State Senate, said he could support allowing immediate family members to inherit rent regulated apartments for one generation. 22 Legislature Is Overturned The Rockland County Legislature is unconstitutional, a Federal judge declared. By dividing representation by towns, voters do not have comparable voting power, he ruled. 24 SPORTS 26-31 Short-Handed Knicks Lose The Knicks lost last night's playoff game to the Miami Heat, 95-90, after a Federal judge upheld the suspensions of Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and three teammates. The teams will meet in Miami for a decisive seventh game on Sunday, when Ewing and Houston will return but John Starks and Larry Johnson will be suspended. 1 BUSINESS DAY 32-45 Dow Drops 138 Points The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 138.88 points, or 1.89 percent. The decline, to 7,194.67, was part of a retreat lead by a selloff of computer and technology stocks and declines in drug, banking, soft drink and household product stocks. 33 Slow Growth in Housing The number of single-family houses being built rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month. Some economists said it was an indication that economic growth was moderating. Construction of apartment buildings led to an overall increase in housing starts of 2.6 percent. 34 Business Digest 32 ARTS 13-17, 20 OBITUARIES 12 James M.

Now Mr. Lang, a multimillionaire industrialist who later encouraged similar efforts through his I Have a Dream Foundation in cities across America, wants to help the next generation. Speaking before a hushed crowd of those original students and their families yesterday on the 16th anniversary of his original gift, Mr. Lang announced that he would extend his scholarship fund to include the children of those he first took under his wing."

Yeltsin scathingly dismissed Russia's two top military leaders, criticizing their resistance to budget cuts. The head of Russia's long-range nuclear arsenal was named acting Defense Minister, replacing Igor N. Rodionov, whose dismissal was televised as a warning to other officials. A1 Surprise Contender in Iran To the surprise of the ruling mullahs in Iran, Mohammed Khatami has drawn huge crowds and emerged as a serious liberal contender in the presidential election today. No real competition had been expected for Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri, the Speaker of the Parliament and the mullahs' choice. Iran's president has limited powers compared with the unelected ''supreme leader,'' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A1 Albright Announces Sanctions Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright announced sanctions against two Chinese companies and a handful of Chinese executives, saying they had knowingly helped Iran make chemical weapons. She said there was no evidence that the Chinese Government had been involved in the companies' efforts to export chemicals and equipment. A1 NATO to Expand Role in Bosnia NATO forces in Bosnia will add non-military tasks to their duties, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said. The change is part of an effort to renew the momentum of the peace accords signed in Dayton, Ohio, eighteen months ago. Ms. Albright is to travel to Bosnia next week. A6 Swiss Reject U.S. Criticism Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti rejected as ''unsupported'' and ''one-sided'' the accusations made in a United States Government report that Switzerland had undermined its vaunted neutrality and prolonged World War II by acting as a banker to Nazi Germany. Mr. Cotti conceded that mistakes had been made but said that his country's national survival had been at stake. A7 Israel Plans Arab Housing The Israeli Interior Ministry said it had approved construction of 3,400 homes in an Arab village next to a hill in Jerusalem where work on a new Jewish neighborhood has seriously frustrated Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The Government had pledged to approve Arab housing when it authorized construction of the Jewish settlement, known as Har Homa. Palestinian officials dismissed the Israeli announcement as propaganda. A10 Sainthood for Jewish-Born Nun Pope John Paul II formally approved sainthood for Edith Stein, a Jewish-born nun killed in a Holocaust gas chamber. No date for the canonization ceremony, which would make her a Roman Catholic saint, was announced. The nun's beatification in 1987 drew criticism from some Jews, who said the Nazis had killed her because of her Jewish heritage, not because of her Catholicism. (AP) NATIONAL A14-24 Embattled Air Force Pilot Accepts General Discharge The country's first female B-52 pilot, First Lieut. Kelly Flinn, will accept a general discharge from the Air Force rather than face a court-martial for adultery, lying and other charges that could have sent her to prison for up to nine and a half years. Air Force officials said a general discharge meant that Lieutenant Flinn would almost certainly not be allowed to fly in the Air Force Reserves and would be required to pay back about $20,000 of the cost of her Air Force Academy education. A1 McVeigh's Defense Begins The lawyers for Timothy J. McVeigh opened their defense by raising the possibility that someone else had been the bomber in the attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City and had been killed in the blast. Oklahoma's medical examiner testified that that he had never been able to link a severed leg found at the scene to a body. A1 Spending Plans Rejected The Senate voted down the last major amendment to the budget resolution, a proposal to spent more money on Federal highway projects, as it moved toward a Congressional commitment to balance the Federal budget by 2002. A measure to set aside $5 billion to rebuild crumbling schools was also defeated. A21 Astronaut Set for Return Jerry M. Linenger expects to walk off Atlantis when he returns to Earth on Saturday after four months on Mir. NASA wants astronauts to be carried off the shuttle after long stretches in space because that makes scientific tests easier to carry out. But only one of Dr. Linenger's three predecessors aboard the Mir was carried from Atlantis. A23 Times Lists Staff Changes Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor of The New York Times, announced the appointments of a managing editor and two deputy managing editors. Bill Keller, 48, the foreign editor and a Pulitzer Prize winner, will become managing editor at the end of September, succeeding Gene Roberts, who will end his leave from the University of Maryland and return to teaching journalism there. The deputy managing editor for news will be Gerald M. Boyd, 46, and the deputy for operations will be John M. Geddes, 45. C31 Laurels for Longevity Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who, at age 94, is already the oldest person ever to serve as a member of Congress, will become the longest-serving Senator in the chamber's history on Sunday. Senator Thurmond says he feels like a ''million dollars'' but would vote for term limits without compunction. A22 Cigars Appealing to the Young More than one-quarter of all boys and girls 14 to 19 years old smoked at least one cigar last year, a Federal study found. The findings astonished public health advocates, who immediately called for Federal warning labels on cigars. A24 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Mobsters' Guards Accused Of Making Jail Cushy Federal officials announced the arrest of 20 people in a sting operation into corruption among guards at a new Federal jail in Brooklyn. The authorities said corrupt guards let top mobsters turn the jail into a social club, where they plotted crimes and sipped vodka and wine. A1 Teacher Accused of Sex Abuse A 41-year-old Brooklyn music teacher, Michael Williams, was charged with sexually abusing a 13-year-old female student in his locked classroom last month. It was the second case in a week in which officials said administrators in a New York City public school had failed to respond promptly in a case involving charges of sexual abuse of a student. The earlier case occurred in Queens. B1 Pataki Yields to Indians Governor Pataki abandoned his effort to collect taxes on gasoline and cigarette sales on Indian reservations. The move was criticized by owners of small businesses operating outside reservations, who have long complained that selling tax-free goods gaves Indian competitors an unfair advantage. But Indian leaders said the move affirmed the tribes' status as sovereign peoples. B1 Harassment Suit Is Filed The Federal Government filed a sexual harassment suit against Sidney Frank Importing and All States Promotions, a liquor importer and a marketing firm, both based in New Rochelle, N.Y., charging that top executives kissed, fondled and made improper advances to more than 100 women employees. A spokesman for the companies denied the charges. B6 Slain Officer Is Buried A funeral was held in West Babylon for Officer Anthony Sanchez, the first police officer killed on the job this year. His wife, Elizabeth, speaking of their 7-year-old son, said, ''John says farewell to the daddy taken from him too soon, who gave him so much love.'' B3 BUSINESS DAY D1-16 Dispute Over Prenatal Test A company headed by Dr. Mark Bogart, Biomedical Patent Management, is demanding that labs across the country pay large royalties when they conduct a prenatal test he says is based on work he patented in 1986.

      "lead_paragraph": "Every time I hear of some new breakdown aboard Russia's Mir space station, I think of my visit some years ago to the Space Research Institute in Moscow. The institute was home to some of the world's most advanced scientific work, and had just choreographed a rendezvous in distant space for one of its spacecraft and Halley's comet. Surely this was one Soviet organization that had eliminated the backward technology so evident in more pedestrian fields like consumer electronics. Then I saw the cashier at the institute cafeteria. She was calculating my lunch tab on an abacus. Michael Foale, the latest American astronaut to take up residence aboard Mir, may not want to look too closely at his quarters. Several years of firsthand experience with Soviet technology tell me the station, now in its 11th year in orbit, is a space jalopy."

      "lead_paragraph": "AS ANY CONSCIENTIOUS ACTOR would, Tom Hanks did a lot of research after he was cast as the astronaut James Lovell in Ron Howard's movie ''Apollo 13.'' He read book after book, talked with astronauts and their families, visited Cape Canaveral and spent time with ground-control technicians. Yet when he was finished, he felt that he had barely scratched the surface, and he hungered to do more. Now, almost four years later, Mr. Hanks is getting a second crack at the subject he regards as perhaps the ''most romantic and inspiring'' of the modern age: man's quest to reach and explore the moon. This time, he is not appearing on screen but is wearing the hat of executive producer and is also serving as a director and a screenwriter. Working with the same production team that made ''Apollo 13,'' he has spent months writing and revising scripts, lining up actors, directors and writers and obtaining the substantial financial backing required to make ''From the Earth to the Moon,'' a 13-part dramatic anthology that will appear on HBO next spring."
