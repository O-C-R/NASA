Adam Johnson's funny-sad-bizarre stories take place in a world located somewhere between Kurt Vonnegut's sci-fi empire and that wild and crazy land of weirdos limned in T. Coraghessan Boyle's stories. It's a place where strange things happen and stranger things threaten to occur; a place recognizable, in its lineaments, from our present-day reality, but exaggerated, italicized or stretched to the point of distortion like Silly Putty. In ''Trauma Plate,'' the daughter of entrepreneurs who own a bullet-proof-vest rental shop asks her boyfriend to take a shot at her Kevlar-protected chest. In ''The Canadanaut,'' a top-secret group of misfit scientists, hidden away in the snowbound reaches of northern Canada, scheme to send a diminutive fur trapper to the Moon. And in ''Teen Sniper,'' a 15-year-old boy works as a police sniper in Silicon Valley, taking down the demented and the delusional, who have been taking hostages at software companies."

As producer and director of ''Space Station 3D,'' the new large-format 3D release from Imax, Ms. Myers had developed an advance ''shopping list'' of set-ups and situations, and aliens were no part of the scenario. The project was documentary in character and proud of it. Still, Ms. Myers had encouraged the orbiting crew members to contribute their own suggestions. Col. Voss's extraterrestrials, she learned much later, were stowaways from the ground: children's toys, cool totems of home, hanging out happily in zero-G."

The 28-year-old millionaire, Mark Shuttleworth, has gone through months of tests and training in Russia to become part of the three-member crew aboard a taxi flight to bring a fresh Soyuz to the station.
