She'd probably be what the British call a ladette, a young woman trying to be one of the lads by drinking to excess, shouting four-letter words and, if necessary, belching. In ''LADETTE TO LADY,'' imported by the SUNDANCE CHANNEL (Thursday, 9 p.m.), some tasteful teachers play Henry Higgins at tasteful Eggleston Hall. They take on 10 proud ladettes, who compete to be transformed into the sorts of girls PRINCE WILLIAM could bring home. The first step is putting them into sweater sets and pearls. Even viewers who think most reality series are drivel may find this one entertaining. The British do that sort of thing so well. Then, sometimes, American television takes a British series and wrings the social anthropology out of it. Yes, the big one is back. ''SURVIVOR: PANAMA -- EXILE ISLAND'' has its season premiere Thursday night at 8 on CBS. A new batch of attractive people (including a retired astronaut, a performance artist and a social worker) compete for big money by being devious and manipulative. There is plenty of worthy, culturally significant programming ahead for Black History Month, but one of the most intriguing specials comes from an unlikely source: TV LAND. WAYNE BRADY is a much better stand-up comedian than he is a talk-show host, but he doesn't need to be scintillating on ''THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,'' which begins on Wednesday (10 p.m.). His guests (HARRY BELAFONTE, DIAHANN CARROLL, PAUL MOONEY and TOURÉ on the first of the three one-hour segments) take the ball and run with it, with some promising straight talk about perceptions of race in popular culture. The old clips and photos speak volumes. And the list of most influential black television shows puts ''THE JEFFERSONS'' ahead of ''ROOTS.''"
