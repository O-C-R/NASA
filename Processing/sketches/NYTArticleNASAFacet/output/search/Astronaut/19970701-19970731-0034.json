Detroit is a powerful draw for anyone interested in African-American history. In the 19th century, it was home to some of the largest ''stations,'' or hiding places, on the Underground Railroad, the network of abolitionists who helped slaves fleeing north to freedom. In this century, waves of African-Americans came from the South to work in the city's auto factories. In the 1960's, Detroit spawned the Motown sound, and today, with a population that is 76 percent African-American, it is the nation's largest city with a black majority."

Mr. Hun Sen, who denied that his actions amounted to a coup, accused Prince Ranariddh of illegal acts and wanted him replaced. It was unclear whether the armed confrontation had ended. Prince Ranariddh was abroad, but his party officials said they had not given up. A1 Caribbean Weighs Tie to Britain Across the English-speaking Caribbean, from Barbados to Jamaica, rising dissatisfaction with the handling of death-row cases is leading Governments to weigh proposals to eliminate formal ties to the British legal system. A1 Body May Be Drug Lord The Mexican Government said there were indications that the body of a man who died after plastic surgery was that of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the billionaire drug trafficker. Although the Government would not completely confirm the drug lord's death, initial tests on the cadaver showed a matching identity. A1 Violence in Northern Ireland The annual march of the Orange Order, a Protestant group, went ahead in a Roman Catholic neighborhood of Northern Ireland after weeks of Government efforts to find a compromise. The police dragged Catholic protesters from the road to clear the way for the parade, and incidents of violence erupted throughout Northern Ireland in response to the decision to allow the march. A3 Pile-Up Kills 62 in Sudan Sixty-two people were killed and 30 seriously injured in a highway pile-up south of Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, state-run television reported. It said a pick-up truck had tried to overtake another car near Kamlin, about 60 miles southeast of the capital, but collided with an oncoming passenger bus and a truck, setting them on fire. Local people tried to put out the blaze with dust and water, as there was no fire station in the area. (Agence France-Presse) Bomb Planted in Moscow An underground Communist group tried to blow up an enormous statue of Peter the Great in Moscow in a protest over a proposal to remove Lenin's body from its mausoleum in Red Square for burial elsewhere, Russian news agencies said. The group, which calls itself the Revolutionary Military Council, said it had planted a bomb but did not detonate it to prevent injuring passers-by. The police defused the device. (Agence France-Presse) Crackdown in Pakistan In a citywide sweep in Karachi, Pakistan, the police arrested 220 people suspected of involvement in a wave of ethnic killings that have left at least 150 people dead in recent months. (AP) Historic Voting in Mexico In San Juan Chamula in the state of Chiapas and across Mexico, voting took place in an election managed for the first time by an autonomous Federal elections council brought about by a reform led by President Ernesto Zedillo. In the race for mayor of Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, an opposition candidate, claimed victory. A1 NATIONAL A8-13, B8 Sojourner Begins a Survey Of Rocks and Soil on Mars The Sojourner, the first mobile explorer of another planet, began prospecting the soil and rocks of Mars and transmitting a flood of data to overjoyed scientists. The roving vehicle pressed the head of one of its scientific instruments to the powdery surface near the Mars Pathfinder and made history as it recorded the surface chemistry. A1 NASA's administrator said the decision on whether to send a replacement NASA astronaut to Russia's troubled Mir space station in September would rest on whether the assignment was judged to be safe and productive. A9 The Hiring of John Huang Congressional investigators say President Clinton took a personal interest in the hiring of John Huang, a fund-raiser whose activities are a central focus of the inquiry into campaign financing improprieties, by the Democratic National Committee, going so far as to ask the committee's finance chairman whether Mr. Huang would be hired. Former party officials have told investigators that in the two months leading up to that conversation, top officials at the White House had strongly urged the Democratic National Committee to hire Mr. Huang so he could begin soliciting contributions from Asian-Americans. A1 A senior Republican Senator investigating campaign-finance abuses urged President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to testify before the Senate committee that begins its televised hearings on Tuesday. B8 Building in Reagan's Honor The Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center is about to be completed on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. Among Federal buildings, the complex is second in size only to the Pentagon. Some say the Reagan Building will save the Government money because $2.2 billion has been spent in rent in the last 60 years to house the Federal offices that will move there. A10 Minister and Poor Against City A flamboyant preacher who favors suspenders and a tie emblazoned with the American flag and the Statue of Liberty goes on trial in Buena Park, Calif., for letting homeless people camp in the parking lot of his First Southern Baptist Church. He faces a maximum of four and a half years in jail for nine misdemeanor charges. A13 NEW YORK/REGION B1-7 Taking on Soft Money With New Campaign Rules New York City officials are applying new rules intended to limit the influence of unregulated political contributions, known as soft money, in the mayoral race. Records show soft money was more widespread in the last mayoral race than was previously known and suggest it may be hard to curb fund-raising and spending that tries to get around the limits set by the city's Campaign Finance Board. B1 A Local March for Hong Kong Chinese-Americans marched through downtown Manhattan to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule. Recent immigrants displayed their affinity to events in China, but protesters in Times Square complained of lingering human-rights abuses in China, cried out for democratic reforms, and said the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule meant more people would come under the control of a corrupt, tyrannical system. B3 Cosby Extortion Trial Opens A trial will open in Manhattan Federal Courthouse for a woman accused of extorting $40 million from Bill Cosby by claiming to be his out-of-wedlock daughter. In pretrial hearings, her lawyers have signaled that they will focus on her belief that he was her father and thus was negotiating her rights as a daughter. B1 Debate on Cameras in Court A debate has erupted in Albany over whether New York should alter or keep its law permitting television cameras in courtrooms, which is considered among the most restrictive in the nation. Some would like to ban television entirely from courtrooms. Others, represented largely by news organizations, like Court TV, want to televise most courtroom proceedings if not all of them. The law gives judges the authority to bar cameras from courtrooms or shield certain witnesses from being filmed while on the stand. B4 SPORTSMONDAY C1-9 Fourth Wimbledon for Sampras Pete Sampras won his fourth Wimbledon championship in five years and his 10th career title in a Grand Slam event, leaving him just two trophies shy of the record. His virtuoso performance against 44th-ranked Cedric Pioline of France demonstrated a perfect and continually perfected grass-court technique. C1 BUSINESS DAY D1-8 '96 Book Sales Plummeted Books went unsold, adult trade sales declined and the shelf life was brief for new titles in 1996, a new study shows. And the book industry itself appears partly to blame.

But if not carefully managed it could turn out to be a diversion that would prevent the Governmental Affairs Committee from fully exploring the Clinton campaign's Asian money connection. Moreover, it should not be allowed to overshadow the real news of the day, which was Senator Fred Thompson's flat statement that American intelligence sources had established that the Chinese Government spent ''substantial sums of money'' in ways that are ''illegal under U.S. law'' to influence the 1996 Presidential and legislative elections. Mr. Thompson has an obligation to support his conclusion with public testimony. If he does, the United States will have to reassess its dealings with China. The effort of a foreign government to tilt an election is a threat to the integrity of American democracy. It would be hard to imagine President Clinton welcoming China's President, Jiang Zemin, to the White House later this year if the charges are true."

The Russian commander aboard Mir is clearly in no shape, physically or mentally, to perform the repairs, so the head of the Russian space agency has asked that the American astronaut already aboard Mir step in to take his place. It is a risky undertaking, but NASA's own specialists believe the risks are manageable. There is no apparent need to wait until a specially trained Russian crew can ride to the rescue. A fellow space power has asked for American help at a critical time and should get it. Lending a hand would almost certainly improve collaboration on the Mir itself and could foster greater cooperation on more earthbound issues as well. This page has long been skeptical about the need for any manned space stations, given that robots can do space research more cheaply and safely than human astronauts, as the current mission on Mars attests. But American use and support of the Mir station, now in its 11th year of service, is more than a space venture. It provides the chance to collaborate with the Russians and keep their space engineers occupied in peaceful work."

The astronaut, Comdr. Wendy B. Lawrence of the Navy, had been scheduled to begin a four-month stay on the Mir in September, but will be replaced by her backup, Dr. David A. Wolf, because he will be able to act as a backup crew member for planned space walks to repair the damaged station, the agency said."

Born Elizabeth Beebe in Brooklyn, New York, Liz excelled at Lincoln High School and at Brooklyn College, and maintained a working knowledge of physics and chemistry. She spent every childhood summer at Camp Taconic in the Berkshire Mountains, building lifelong friendships there. Her early ambitions included becoming a ballerina or an astronaut. Instead, she became an entrepreneur, creating several successful businesses built on her fine eye for style and design. Liz's companies included Beaux Dangles (women's high-fashion accessories) and Really Lizzie (unique children's gifts). Most recently, she was the proprietor of GreenHouse of Winnetka, Illinois, an innovative shop specializing in antiques for rooms and gardens. She traveled the country pursuing unusual and fine objects for her customers and her home. Liz was generous to close friends and business acquaintances alike, and provided both knowledge and encouragement to many women who suffered with her disease. She was loving and wise for her children, Rachel and Adam; her husband, Neil, and her brother, Hank, all of whom survive her. She was unfailingly supportive to her family through every big and little crisis in their lives. Despite her illness, Liz had no bitterness or regrets about her own life, only good humor and enthusiasm for her next challenge. Her strength was extraordinary. With her courage, her ready wit and keen intellect, and especially her loving spirit, she enriched the lives of all who knew her."
