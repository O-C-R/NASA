It started in 1964 with \"7 Up,\" a documentary produced by Granada Television that looked at Britain through the eyes of these individuals as 7-year-olds. I was 22, had just left Cambridge University with a law degree and had been hired to find the children from as diverse backgrounds as possible and, with the director Paul Almond, to get their opinions on money, love, God, sex, race, school and one another. We also wanted to know what they had in mind for their futures. These were the politicians, managers, union leaders and parents of the year 2000, so what kind of England could we look forward to? We used the Jesuit idea \"give me a child until he is 7 and I will show you the man,\" but, frankly, our underlying concept was political. Granada was a left-wing company, and in the heady days of 1964 when England was the pop-cultural center of the world, we wanted to see whether the dynamics that gave fame and fortune to the Beatles, the Stones and other icons had permeated our class system. Did everybody have a fair chance, or did the accident of birth bring power, wealth and success? Were children made into winners or losers by class divisions, or was the old order changing forever?"

All the adventurers who previously attempted the daunting 22,000-mile voyage have failed, but this week an American balloon ace, a seasoned aeronautical mechanic and a senior Russian astronaut are completing preparations for the launching of Earthwinds, the most complex and advanced balloon ever built. If all goes well in the next few days here, the huge craft, carrying American and Russian scientific experiments as well as the three crew members, will ascend on Thursday or Friday from its berth at the Loral Defense Systems Air Dock, a gigantic hangar built in 1929 to accommodate the largest dirigibles ever built in America, the ill-fated Akron and Macon. The Earthwinds balloon is supposed to rise slowly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet, slip into the eastward-flowing jet stream, and complete its trip around the world in something under two weeks."
