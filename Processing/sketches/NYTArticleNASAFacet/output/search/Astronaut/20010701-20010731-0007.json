The strip leads to the office of Satoshi Fukushima, a deaf and blind associate professor who was hired this spring to create the university's ''barrier-free'' studies program, a curriculum that aims to eliminate the huge barriers -- social, physical and psychological -- that have prevented the disabled from participating in society here."
