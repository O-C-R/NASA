The board chairman, Ed Gibson, a former Skylab astronaut, and five other members work for companies hired by NASA on the multibillion-dollar space shuttle replacement program. The NASA inspector general, the agency's in-house watchdog, calls that a conflict of interest and recommends suspending the six board members. The board has 19 members. NASA contends that in the specialized field of aerospace, most of the experts work for either NASA or its contractors. Plans call for astronauts to return to the Moon by 2020."

The shuttle, with its crew of seven astronauts, is scheduled to blast off at 5:02 Saturday afternoon to bring a tour-bus-sized science laboratory to the station, the $1 billion ''Kibo'' module. Kathy Winters, a weather officer with the 45th Weather Squadron of the Air Force, announced at a morning briefing with reporters on Friday that the probability that weather conditions would be favorable for launch at an unusually high 80 percent. ''The weather is looking promising,'' she said, but added that if technical issues cause a delay, conditions will worsen over the next two days. No technical glitches with the vehicle have emerged."
