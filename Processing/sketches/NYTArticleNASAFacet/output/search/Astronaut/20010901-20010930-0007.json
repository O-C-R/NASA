''There is smoke and dust in wider spread areas than we have seen before, particularly as areas like Africa dry up in certain regions,'' Frank Culbertson, an American astronaut, told the BBC. ''I have seen changes in what comes out of some of the rivers, in land usage. We see areas of the world that are being burned to clear land, so we are losing lots of trees.''"

      "lead_paragraph": "In his quiet way, Robert Charles Wilson has produced one of the most impressive bodies of work in contemporary science fiction. His best novels, like ''The Divide'' and ''The Harvest,'' reimagine such standard themes as poor-lonely-superman and aliens-bearing-gifts in narratives that are both literate and suspenseful. Even when he misses the mark, as in the overheated ''Darwinia,'' he is worth reading for his sympathetic portraits of reasonable men and women confronting an untidy reality. Wilson's new novel, THE CHRONOLITHS (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95), stands with his best. All serious time-travel stories must deal with the logical conundrum inherent in the concept: once you fool with the normal progression of cause and effect, it's hard to keep any action from seeming capricious. Wilson tackles this challenge head-on, by placing it at the very center of his story. A succession of colossal monuments, made of some apparently indestructible substance, begin materializing in random locations around the world. Each bears an inscription celebrating the military triumph of someone or something named Kuin, and all are dated 20 years in the future."

She held a cup of coffee in one hand and a delicious-smelling wedge of pizza in the other, while balancing a heavy briefcase that hung from her shoulder on a wide strap. She had arranged her fingers so that they held the pizza flat, her index finger making sure that the pointed end did not droop. As the train lurched, I imagined being spattered with tomato sauce and scalding coffee, but the woman loped past me like an athlete and settled in a corner, standing, feet and legs arranged to brace against jolts. The pizza was still held flat and the coffee undisturbed. She slipped the end of the pizza into her mouth and proceeded to eat it with the grace of Emily Post. She then bit off the recessed plastic triangle in the top cover of the paper cup and, holding the coffee in her left hand, she used her right hand to fold the triangle into her napkin. After dabbing her mouth with the neat square, she slid it into a side pocket of her briefcase. Next she took out a lipstick holder, flipped up the top with her thumb, let it slide into her palm and applied red coloring to her lips. Yes, she was still drinking coffee using her other hand."

Now Playing ''AMERICAN PIE 2,'' starring Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Shannon Elizabeth and Alyson Hannigan. Directed by J. B. Rogers (R, 104 minutes). This sequel reunites the Michigan teenagers whose clumsy eagerness to be relieved of their virginity fueled the first picture. A lot of the humor in this film consists of references to stuff that happened the first time around, though Mr. Biggs does encounter some novel forms of sexual humiliation, including the painful misapplication of some super-adhesive glue. The rest of the cast members return, some of them quite briefly, for more of the dirty-minded, curiously sweet-natured scenes that are the secret of the franchise's success (A. O. Scott)."
