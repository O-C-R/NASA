Mission managers gave tentative approval on Sunday to plans for a complex two-spacewalk repair job late this week. The cooling system, which dissipates heat generated by the lab's electronics, initially shut down around 8 p.m. Eastern time on Saturday when a circuit breaker tripped, setting off warning alarms that awoke the crew. With reduced cooling, flight controllers were forced to shut down two of the space station's four stabilizing gyroscopes, used to help control the lab's orientation; one communications channel; and several computer control units."

Will any astronauts be tossing it in their carry-ons? Some books have been launched into space. Ron Garan, a NASA astronaut who is preparing to fly to the International Space Station in March, has been posting Twitter updates about the books he's taking along, including ''The Blue Sweater: Bridging the Gap Between Rich and Poor in an Interconnected World,'' by Jacqueline Novogratz, and Muhammad Yunus's ''Creating a World Without Poverty.'' He may also find some books left behind by previous travelers, including Goethe's ''Faust'' and Robert A. Heinlein's sci-fi classic ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress,'' carried up by the former Microsoft executive Charles Simonyi during his two self-financed voyages. Are there e-books in space? Astronauts do have iPods, according to Robert Pearlman, the editor of the space history Web site collectSPACE, but ''they are of the older, pre-touch-screen generation, and no Kindles, to my knowledge, have made their way to orbit as of yet.'' (Apparently, they have not yet been tested to make sure they don't release dangerous gases.) But astronauts do carry laptops, Pearlman added, and at least one book, ''Principles of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight,'' whose co-editor is the astronaut and physician Michael Barratt, has been read -- and revised -- digitally in orbit."

And Ralph Lauren's gilded empire between East 71st and 72nd Streets is expanding, with a store devoted to his women's line and home now under construction (No. 888). 1 At HICKOREE'S HARD GOODS, ''We like products that evoke nostalgia for our childhood, like astronaut ice cream,'' said Emil Corsillo (pictured, left, with Sandy, his brother), who opened the store inside the just-opened, pine-fresh J. Crew Men's Shop. The Hickoree's shop, which occupies a former bank vault, began online and specializes in uncommon American-made products. Items include Hill-Side ties ($76); colorful Solmate socks (recycled materials, $19), canvas Mason bags ($79) and the Original Tree Swing (a slingshot, $21). The store is at 1040 Madison Avenue (79th Street); (212) 453-2677, hickorees.com."
