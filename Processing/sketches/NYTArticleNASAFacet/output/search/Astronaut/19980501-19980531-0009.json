At 10:35 A.M., 14 minutes to lift-off, the astronauts, students at Timothy Christian School here, were squirming with excitement inside the bus while launch control checking the shuttle's systems. After months of science lessons on space and weeks of physical training in gym class, this was the moment that the children had awaited. Systems checked, and the countdown began. ''15, 14, 13, 12 . . . '' said the launch director, a fifth-grader sitting on a stage about 30 feet away."

So the costly comet thriller ''Deep Impact,'' which is to summer movies what the first crocus is to springtime, explores the salutary effects of imminent doom. Lovers bond, family ties bind and old wounds heal as the planet prepares for its final hours, although the crisis proves not as dire as it could have been. We will survive to be hit by another comet picture (''Armageddon'') in July. ''Deep Impact'' will doubtless seem the more sensitive of the two, since it emphasizes feelings over firepower whenever possible. Mimi Leder, who directed ''The Peacemaker'' and gives greater gloss and personality to this film, directs with a distinct womanly touch. Within the end-of-the-world action genre, it's rare to find attention paid to rescuing art, antiques, elephants and flamingos. Or to see the day care center at the television station, a peaceful counterpart to the frenzied newsroom. ''Geologists and climatologists!'' shouts a newsroom staff member as the comet story goes public. ''Does anyone know how big was the one that killed all the dinosaurs?''"

But that's not what he will be remembered for. His elegant, fanciful plays, written mostly in rhymed verse, have been presented in theaters from the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, his hometown, to the Edinburgh Festival Theater in Scotland. He also wrote the libretto for Virgil Thomson's opera ''Lord Byron.'' And in another turn of career, he was associate producer on films like ''The Paper Chase,'' ''Urban Cowboy'' and ''The China Syndrome.'' But even these endeavors are a mere blip on the radar screen of public attention in comparison with the true source of his lasting fame: In the 1950's, he played Jimmy Olsen, cub reporter for The Daily Planet, on ''The Adventures of Superman,'' a television series that continues today in syndication. Mr. Larson is an icon of American popular culture. The bow tie he wore as Jimmy Olsen is on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, next to Archie Bunker's easy chair and Dorothy's ruby slippers. He still gets fan mail and is stopped on the street by strangers."
