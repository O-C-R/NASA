But while prominent in the public eye, the mishaps this year are dwarfed by the benefits the station has yielded both for Russia and its partner in the effort, the United States. When the Russians shut down the station -- as they probably will within a year or so -- they will leave knowing that Mir has substantially advanced what we know about life and work in space and has paved the way for a trip to the nearest planets. Mir has been aloft for 11 years, but it registered in the popular consciousness only in June, when a robot supply ship collided with the station's science laboratory. The collision punctured and depressurized the laboratory compartment, forcing the crew to cut power cables that had been jury-rigged and strung through an open door that now had to be closed. The accident left Mir with only partial power and its science lab out of commission."
