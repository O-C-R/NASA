In much the same way, NBC was elated when it topped ''Idol'' on one night of its Winter Olympics coverage in February."

Fewer people watched ''Idol'' on Tuesday (when the contestant Crystal Bowersox performed with the didgeridoo player Ernie Fields, both left) than watched ABC's ''Dancing With the Stars'' on Monday. (''Dancing'' runs performance episodes on Mondays, with results on Tuesdays; ''Idol'' generally has performance on Tuesdays with results on Wednesdays.) And for a second consecutive week, in the category Fox cares most about -- viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 -- ''Idol,'' if the Tuesday overnight ratings hold, will post its lowest number ever for a two-hour edition of the show. It will also be the lowest-rated Tuesday edition of the show since an hourlong episode on Aug. 13, 2002, in its first season, when the series played in the summer. ''Idol'' had a total audience of about 20.4 million on Tuesday, below the 21.2 million that ''Dancing'' averaged for its performance show on Monday. (The ''Dancing'' results on Tuesday averaged a total audience of 12.3 million.) But the ''Idol'' 7.1 rating among viewers 18 to 49 is what will be most noticed. That is down from a 7.7 a week ago and down from the 8.1 the show averaged for the three previous weeks. Of course, ''Idol'' is still the dominant show on television with those younger adults advertisers love. And the success of ''Dancing'' has to be tempered by its skew toward older viewers. This week's ''Dancing'' results episode, when the astronaut Buzz Aldrin was blasted off the show, faced the ''Idol'' performance on Tuesday night and scored a modest 2.4 rating in the 18 to 49 group. More tellingly, almost 70 percent of its audience was over 50."

Mr. Obama's critics accuse him of abandoning NASA's glorious trailblazing tradition -- and maybe, if your constituents have jobs at NASA, it's possible to see something pioneering about an agency whose flagship goes a few hundred miles into space."

(BBC America) TOP GEAR After buying used cars -- an FJ40 Toyota Land Cruiser, a Range Rover Classic, above, and a Suzuki Jimny -- over the Internet from dealers in Bolivia, James May, Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond embark on a 1,000-mile drive from the middle of the Amazon rain forest to the Pacific coast of Chile through the treacherous terrain in the altiplano region, the Andes and the Atacama Desert. The ascent to La Paz along the steep North Yungas Road, popularly known as El Camino de la Muerte (''The Road of Death''), so terrifies the acrophobic Mr. May that he humorously threatens to cut off the head of anyone who bumps him. But he seems to be only half-kidding when he pulls a machete on Mr. Clarkson after a small accident. The two men leave their weapons behind when they appear on a special episode of ''Friday Night With Jonathan Ross'' at 9:40. 7 A.M. (NBC) TODAY The guests include former President Bill Clinton and Jennifer Lopez. Here and on ''The View,'' at 11 a.m. on ABC, Alyssa Milano also promotes her new series, ''Romantically Challenged'' (Monday night at 9:30 on ABC), in which she plays a divorcée about to start dating for the first time since the Clinton administration."

Louis, Dimitri's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, was undergoing surgery so painful that he fell unconscious. When the Sun King finally awoke, his subjects gathered around his bed in the palace at Versailles and asked how he felt. Even as he lay in agony, by Prince Dimitri's recounting, Louis XIV stammered: ''The man is suffering. But the king is all right.'' Four centuries later in the kingdom of Manhattan, Dimitri Karageorgevich, the 51-year-old son of Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia and Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, must also reconcile his identities. The man awakes in a two-bedroom apartment on Sutton Place, uses the elliptical trainer at Equinox and spends most days working in his jewelry business. The prince works in an office filled with photographs of moments with famous friends like Pope John Paul II (Dimitri's family gave the pope the Shroud of Turin), and he welcomes impromptu guests like the aged lady-in-waiting for Princess Marianne Bernadotte of Sweden. On weekends, the man shops for lettuce at Food Emporium and indulges in croissants from the patisserie Financier. The prince glides across the dance floor at a Carnival ball with the heiress Catherine Forbes by his side."
