      "lead_paragraph": "Vance D. Brand Mission Commander Mr. Brand, 59 years old, is making his fourth space flight since becoming an astronaut in 1966. On his first, he was the command module pilot for the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975, which led to the historic meeting in space between American and Soviet astronauts. In 1982 he commanded the first fully operational shuttle transportation system that launched the Columbia. He also commanded the Challenger in 1984. A native of Longmont, Colo., he studied business and aeronautical engineering at the University of Colorado and received a master's degree in business administration from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1964. Before joining the space agency, Mr. Brand was a commissioned officer and naval aviator with the Marine Corps from 1953 to 1957. A graduate of the Naval Test Pilot School, he has logged 8,777 flying hours in more than 30 types of military aircraft. Mr. Brand served in the Marine Corps Reserve and the Air National Guard jet fighter squadrons until 1964 and worked for the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation as a flight test engineer and test pilot from 1960 to 1966. Col. Guy S. Gardner Pilot Colonel Gardner, 42, of the Air Force, was also the pilot on his only previous shuttle mission, a four-day flight of the Atlantis in 1988. A native of Alexandria, Va., Colonel Gardner graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1969 and received a master's degree in astronautics from Purdue University in 1970. After completing pilot training, he flew 177 combat missions in Southeast Asia in 1972. He attended test pilot school at Edwards Air Force base in 1975 and worked as an instructor pilot there from 1977 to 1978. Colonel Gardner has logged over 4,000 hours flying time and 105 hours in space. Jeffrey A. Hoffman Mission Specialist Dr. Hoffman, a 46-year-old who grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., is making his second shuttle flight. Aboard the shuttle Discovery in 1985, he made the first unplanned shuttle spacewalk in an effort to repair a satellite. Dr. Hoffman received a bachelor's degree in astronomy from Amherst College in 1966, a doctorate in astrophysics from Harvard University in 1971 and a master's degree in materials science from Rice University in 1988. He joined NASA in 1978 and has worked on the development of a high-pressure space suit for use on the proposed Space Station Freedom. John M. (Mike) Lounge Mission Specialist Mr. Lounge, 44, from Burlington, Colo., is making his third shuttle flight. He was selected as an astronaut in 1980 and has logged more than 267 hours in space. His first mission was aboard the Discovery in 1985, in which he deployed an Australian communications satellite. His second flight was aboard the Discovery in 1988. Mr. Lounge graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1969 and received a master's degree in astrogeophysics from the University of Colorado in 1970. At NASA he is chief of the office that deals with the design and operation of the proposed space station. Robert A. R. Parker Mission Specialist Dr. Parker, 53, joined NASA as a scientist-astronaut in 1967. He is the director of the space flight/space station integration office at NASA headquarters. This is his second shuttle flight. Dr. Parker grew up in Shrewsbury, Mass., and was a member of the astronaut support crews for the Apollo 15 and 17 missions. He has worked in the office of the Skylab program director and served as a mission specialist for the first Spacelab on the shuttle Columbia in 1983. A 1958 graduate of Amherst College, Dr. Parker received a doctorate in astronomy from the California Institute of Technology in 1962. Before his selection for astronaut training, he worked as an associate professor of astronomy at the University of Wisconsin. Samuel T. Durrance Payload Specialist Dr. Durrance, 47, is a research scientist in the department of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. His field of interest is the origin and evolution of planets. This is his first space flight. Dr. Durrance has made observations of Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus using the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite. He helped develop special point techniques to observe solar system objects with that satellite. Originally from Tampa, Fla., Dr. Durrance received a master's degree in physics from California State University and a doctorate in astrogeophysics from the University of Colorado. Ronald A. Parise Payload Specialist Dr. Parise, 39, is a senior scientist in the space observatories department of the Computer Science Corporation in Silver Spring, Md. This will be his first space flight. Dr. Parise is a member of the research team for the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope Project, one of the instruments scheduled for this mission. He helped plan the project's activities and design the hardware and electronic system. During the flight he will conduct an experiment to communicate with amateur radio stations. A native of Warren, Ohio, Dr. Parise graduated from Youngstown State University and received a master's degree and doctorate in astronomy from the University of Florida."

      "lead_paragraph": "In the first class taught from space, astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia beamed a science lesson today to 41 middle school students. \"You may have heard of some of the problems we've been having,\" an astronaut, Dr. Jeffrey A. Hoffman, said. Students drawn from four southeastern states watched him on television screens in classrooms set up at two NASA centers, one at the Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville and another at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \"It's been quite an interesting and dynamic mission,\" Dr. Hoffman said. The shuttle's $150 million Astro observatory, crippled by computer failures, was put back in operation today with the help of commands sent from the ground. Observations were halted on Thursday when a computer overheated and failed, the latest setback in the shuttle's 10-day mission, which ends Tuesday. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hurriedly carried out a new plan in which ground crews aim and turn on the shuttle's three ultraviolet telescopes, with the astronauts using a joystick to zero-in on the targets. The telescopes were tested one by one and by today were producing results surpassing scientists' expectations. Remembering a Teacher In one success, two astronauts, Dr. Ronald A. Parise and Robert A. R. Parker, focused all three ultraviolet telescopes on a quasar for 51 minutes, three minutes longer than planned. The problems have forced the astronauts to miss more than 100 observations of the 250 that were scheduled. An X-ray telescope has been operating without problems. Today's space lesson, conducted by four of the seven astronauts aboard Columbia, took place nearly five years after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger that killed all seven aboard, including Christa McAuliffe, who was to be the first teacher in space. \"We weren't trying to take the place of what they were going to do on Challenger,\" said Karen Widenhofer, a Madison County, Ala., teacher who assisted in the classroom today at the Marshall Space Flight Center here.\"But this shows that NASA is still interested in education and encouraging students in science and math. NASA still plans to put a teacher in space.\" Denny Elkins, a ninth-grader from Snellville, Ga., was one of the 12 middle school students who sat in the classroom at Marshall. He said he was watching on television when Challenger's liftoff turned into a fireball. Renewing an Ambition \"I saw it live because I already was interested in space travel,\" he said. \"The explosion was the biggest impression of my life. I really wanted to be an astronaut, but when I saw that, I said, 'No.' \"Now I'm reconsidering.\" During the opening 35-minute lesson, which began about 15 minutes late because of problems linking the communications systems, Dr. Hoffman wore a dress shirt and tie. Astronauts usually wear casual clothes, donning space suits for takeoffs and landings. \"When I started thinking about giving a classroom talk in space, I thought back to my own school days and I realized that all of the men teachers I had wore ties,\" Dr. Hoffman said. \"As far as I know, nobody's ever worn a tie in space. I thought I'd give it a try and see what it looks like in celebration of this space classroom occasion, and I can tell you it works quite well.\" He added, pushing down his floating, burgundy tie, \"You have to be a little careful in zero gravity, as you can see.\" Star Light, Bright or Not Dr. Hoffman and another astronaut, Dr. Samuel T. Durrance, focused their lesson on star formations and celestial radiation. To illustrate the importance of studying all types of radiation emitted from celestial objects, Dr. Durrance played two versions of the theme from the film \"Star Wars.\" Low- and high-frequency notes were filtered electronically from the first version, and the music was unrecognizable. The same measures then were played with all the notes. \"As you can see, you need to hear all the notes to recognize the song to appreciate its full musical quality,\" Dr. Durrance said. \"Studying the universe is the same way. The universe is playing a kind of symphony in the light that its produces. Up here in space, our telescopes can see all the radiation to better understand the universe.\" After the astronauts' lesson, Ms. Widenhofer taught the students at Marshall for an hour more. Another 29 students took part in a similar space classroom at Goddard. You, Down on Earth The space schoolhouse concluded with Dr. Parise and Mr. Parker fielding questions from the students on Earth, 218 miles below the shuttle. \"I'd like to know, what is the most tedious and painstaking part of your mission so far?\" said Mario Trimble, a ninth-grader from Montgomery, Ala. \"When you fly a mission, most of the time is scheduled very tightly and there are a lot of things to do,\" Dr. Parise replied. \"Unfortunately, some failures with computer terminals have caused us to redo the way we're doing our mission. We're slowly working around everything.\" Bart Doran of Glen, Miss., wanted to know how the problems had affected the Columbia's missions. \"Very greatly,\" said Mr. Parker, explaining that some of the telescope operations had to be done by hand instead of by computers."

The 48-year-old television reporter accompanied two Soviet astronauts to the Mir-2 space station for an eight-day stay, becoming the first journalist -- and the first Japanese -- to report from space. It was strictly a business arrangement for the Soviets, who sold Mr. Akiyama his ride into orbit as part of a $12 million deal with Japanese corporations who got to paint their logos on the rocket or the launching pad. It seemed to be strictly business for Mr. Akiyama as well. \"If I work hard and I'm successful, I expect to get a bonus,\" he said. But he could be charged with theft of thunder. Officials had hoped that the first Japanese in space would be the government astronaut who will ride the American space shuttle next year. They were openly displeased that the feat was accomplished with Soviet equipment."
