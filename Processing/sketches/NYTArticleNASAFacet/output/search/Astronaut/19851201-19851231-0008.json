However, the Philharmonic was not in attendance - just one of its part-time members, George Plimpton, the author, editor and dilettante par excellence. Winding up his hourlong portion of this PEN Celebration, the seventh of eight Sunday nights on Broadway with noted writers, Mr. Plimpton elected to play a phonograph recording of brief portions of the last movement of Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony, where, as the percussionist on the recording, his role was to hit the gong. Mr. Plimpton acquitted himself handsomely on the recording, but on stage, holding in rapt anticipation the gong he had brought for his big moment, he struck several counts too early. But by that time he had already made a big hit with the near-capacity audience that turned out on a dreary night."

The six men and one woman aboard Atlantis spent their final full day in space concluding an array of experiments and preparing for their scheduled landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at 4:33 P.M.

Mr. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat, said that, at his request, Representative Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, agreed to take a mezuza with him on the space shuttle Dec. 18. A mezuza is a small piece of parchment inscribed with passages from Deuteronomy and rolled up in a case that is affixed to the doorways of observant Jews. Mr. Solarz said that his would be ''the first mezuza in space'' and that he would probably keep it at his office when it comes back."

After puncturing the air over Los Angeles with a trail of double sonic booms, the Atlantis glided up to the Mojave Desert, made a 170-degree left turn and landed on the large concrete runway here. It rolled to a stop at 1:33 P.M., Pacific standard time. ''Welcome home, Atlantis - great landing,'' Mission Control told the seven crew members, led by the mission commander, Lieut. Col. Brewster H. Shaw Jr. Shuttles usually land on endless dirt runways at the base. But a week of rain left scattered puddles on the usually dry lake bed runways. Remnants of rain clouds and wispy mare'stails filled the sky as the Atlantis returned to the Earth, seven days and 2.8 million miles after its blazing nighttime liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla."

Among the seven crew members is Representative Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who heads the House subcommittee that oversees the budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Barring last-minute problems or bad weather, the Columbia is scheduled to begin the five-day mission at 7 A.M. The goals of the flight are to launch an RCA communications satellite and to carry out a series of experiments in materials science, astrophysics, technology development and life sciences. In addition, two experiments will try to solve some of the riddles of Halley's comet."
