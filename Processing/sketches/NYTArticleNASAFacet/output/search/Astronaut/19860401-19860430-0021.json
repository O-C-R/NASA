Rocket engineers from the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., were examining the salvaged fragment, a twisted piece of metal about 10 feet by 15 feet, for clues to any malfunction of the joint that might have caused the space shuttle to explode Jan. 28, killing the crew of seven. They also were studying the part for insights into how to redesign the boosters for future shuttle flights. This was the first confirmation that the Navy salvage team had recovered a key part of the right booster rocket. But the portion of the joint that apparently failed and led to the explosion was missing from the recovered wreckage."

The new head of the shuttle program, Rear Adm. Richard H. Truly of the Navy, after meeting privately with the astronaut corps last week, said he expected some of the astronauts to quit the program soon, but not ''in a huff.'' Admiral Truly's remark only hinted at the internal tensions in the 95-member astronaut corps. Old and sometimes bitter strains, said to stem from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's style of management and manner of facing safety problems, have become apparent in the weeks since the loss of five of the astronauts' colleagues and two other crew members in the explosion of the Challenger."

The members also hinted strongly that they would favor a major design change that would enable astronauts to escape in case of imminent disaster. When the Challenger blew up on Jan. 28, all seven astronauts died. Both changes seem likely to meet resistance from some top managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who have said privately in recent weeks that both the shuttle program and their own chain of command can be patched to fly again. And even the astronaut corps seems divided over the need for an escape mechanism, which could greatly extend the delay of shuttle flights."

The official, Arnold Aldrich, testified that although he was head of the entire shuttle program, he was never informed of the issues being raised about the safety of joints in the booster rockets in months of discussions among engineers from the company that built the rockets and from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration itself. A failure in those joints is believed to have caused the Challenger disaster Jan. 28, in which the crew of seven astronauts died. Failure in Communications Mr. Aldrich, who is based at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the joints' problems had been discussed at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., and at NASA headquarters in Washington, but the problems were ''not brought through my office in either direction.'' According to the shuttle program's organizational charts, Mr. Aldrich is the manager of the national shuttle program. The Marshall center, which is responsible for the booster rockets, was supposed to report major problems to him."

YOUNG: Last year was a incredibly good year for the space program. We flew nine space shuttle missions, which was four more than we flew in '84, and we almost flew 10. But we had hold kills and one remanifest, and people say, well, that's bad luck. Well, I tell you, when you have a hold kill in this vehicle, the best place to have it is before liftoff. There's no doubt about it. We had to do a remanifest and if you're not ready to fly that's exactly what you ought to do. So I think those were good luck. DR. RICHARD P. FEYNMAN: Sir, what's a hold kill and what's a remanifest? YOUNG: A hold kill is when you're down there at the launch pad. You get right up to engine start and the engine doesn't start or it starts and then shuts down because it has a problem. A remanifest is when you roll back and decide to go with another payload. So you put a new payload in. FEYNMAN: Thank you. WILLIAM P. ROGERS: Did at the end of 1985 your office feel that you had had too much to do?"

This column periodically offers a selection of such questions. ''SHALL I DIE? SHALL I FLY?'' Are these Shakespeare's words? The question was raised in November when an untitled love poem that opened with that line was attributed to Shakespeare. Gary Taylor, an American scholar who lives in England, made the discovery in the well-combed archives of the Bodleian Library in Oxford among 50 poems by Herrick, Donne, Jonson and others. The nine-stanza work included internal rhymes that resembled Shakespeare's, Mr. Taylor said, offering arguments based on similarities to other writings by the Bard."

Gagarin, who died in a plane crash in 1968, was a 27-year-old major in the Soviet Air Force when he made his historic flight, orbiting the earth in 108 minutes in a rocket-propelled, five-ton space capsule at a height of 187 miles. He returned to earth as an international hero and was subsequently promoted to colonel."

In the commission's first formal news conference, four members of the group's accident analysis panel said that a burned-out section of the shuttle's right booster rocket recovered from the Atlantic Ocean this week provides important confirming evidence that a failure of the rocket joint set off the disaster. But they added that they did not expect that evidence, or any other evidence likely to emerge in the rest of the investigation, to prove what caused the joint to fail. ''I don't believe that we'll home in on any one specific action that caused this failure,'' said Maj. Gen. Donald J. Kutyna of the Air Force, chairman of the analysis panel."

They trained with the six other crew members in making emergency escapes from the launching pad or from the shuttle after a hazardous landing. They learned how to put out fires in the crew compartment and to protect themselves against noxious fumes."

Dr. Fletcher faced some penetrating questions when he appeared before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation for a confirmation hearing this afternoon, but most Republicans and Democrats generally supported his nomination. Dr. Fletcher, who headed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from 1971 to 1977, was asked by President Reagan in March to return to the agency to fill a leadership vacuum. The agency has been without a permanent head since James M. Beggs, the Administrator, took a leave of absence in December to fight an indictment on Federal fraud charges unconnected with his work at NASA. He later resigned."

Escorted by members of the astronaut corps, the remains of the Challenger crew were flown to a military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. From Dover, they are to be turned over to family members who are making funeral arrangements. A moment after it took off, the four-engine jet carrying the remains of the crew banked over the empty gantry of Launching Pad 39-B, from which the Challenger blasted off on its fatal flight three months ago. The shuttle broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, destroying the spaceship and killing its crew."
