      "lead_paragraph": "LOVE is a drug, and so too is war in Kathryn Bigelow's visceral and morally urgent ''Hurt Locker.'' A story about men and battle and the murderous highs of violence, the film is set in the Iraq of 2004, the year that the torture photographs from Abu Ghraib were revealed to the world, the year that four American contractors were murdered in Falluja, the year that the American military death toll reached 1,000. Written by a journalist, Mark Boal, who based the story on his experiences covering Iraq, it centers on a crew of technicians who spend their dusty days and eerie nights in and around Baghdad disarming bombs. Ms. Bigelow has spent her career bending genre to her intelligent ways. ''The Hurt Locker'' is a war movie that successfully goes where few do or can: inside the kill zone of a man's head, namely that of Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), a young bomb tech who lives for his near-death experiences. Like most of Ms. Bigelow's most memorable characters, James has pushed against his own limits and then pushed some more. He's a danger addict who walks directly into the abyss so he can hear the thump thump thump of his own ticking heart, itself an incendiary device. But war isn't a solitary act and James can only feed his habit by imperiling others: this is his tragedy and, by extension, ours."

Now, after nine years spent establishing a repertory of rarities from Monteverdi to Piazzolla, the company is preparing its next space adventure. The vehicle this time is Haydn's comedy ''Il Mondo Della Luna'' (''The World on the Moon''), to be presented, with unassailable if quixotic logic, in the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History beginning on Tuesday evening. As you may expect, the world on the moon is a place in a patsy's mind. The gullible Gulliver who gets taken there is the elderly Buonafede, who starts out with buckets of money, two marriageable daughters to tyrannize and a mercenary maid who wraps him around her little finger. He also has a personal astronomer, Ecclitico, through whose spyglass he glimpses titillating lunar shenanigans. (A young woman pleasures an old man; a husband canes his wife; an abused mistress pleads with her lover for mercy.) Deposited back on earth in the third act, Buonafede has only his memories of his fake adventure. The youngsters have made matches to suit themselves, siphoning off generous dowries besides. Yet with little ado, Buonafede comes round, and for the moment all's right with the world."

This follows the delivery in October of a rather bleak reassessment of the activity by an expert commission led by Norman Augustine, the former Lockheed Martin CEO. Its verdict was that without an increase in funding, U.S. crewed space flight ''appears to be on an unsustainable trajectory.''"
