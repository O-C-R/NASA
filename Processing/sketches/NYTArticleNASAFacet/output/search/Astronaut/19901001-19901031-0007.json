The astronaut's plane came within 100 feet of the passenger jet, the board said, citing radar data from the airport's traffic control center. In September 1989 another T-38 jet trainer flown by an astronaut from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency passed within 1,400 feet of a private plane, the board said. And last May another NASA jet passed within 1,600 feet of an Eastern Airlines DC-9 near Paducah, Ky. The safety board did not immediately identify the astronauts. Richard Truly, Administrator of the space agency, said, \"The investigative N.T.S.B. report is thorough and constructive and we will seriously consider all of the recommendations.\" He said the agency was already implementing one of them, upgrading the T-38 elecronic system."

Space-walking astronauts would also be asked to install a device with corrective optics for light reaching the other important scientific instruments."
