By R.V.DENENBERG From the glass-enclosed passenger lounge at Peking Airport, I watched the four-engine jet position itself on the runway, ready for boarding. I was flying west that morning, to the remote region of Xinjiang in China's desert zone. The destination was exotic and, for that matter, so was the means of transportation: a domestic flight on CAAC, China's homegrown airline. It turned out to be an adventure - a great leap backward into the era before hot face towels, microwaved hors d'oeuvres and stereo headphones. I had experienced no-frills flying before, but CAAC's style on the Urumqi run and two other flights I was to take could be described more aptly as barebones."

Slayton, is retiring from the corps. Mr. Slayton, known as Deke, packed up his memories this week, those models of airplanes and spacecraft he has flown and of the space shuttle that age will not let him fly. He took the awards and photographs off his office wall, including pictures of the seven crew-cut astronauts of 1959. Some of the pictures were faded, like the memories. He left on Friday without fanfare, which is Mr. Slayton's way. The heroes' pedestals and resounding cheers were phenomena of the early space age that Mr. Slayton did not quite comprehend then and chooses not to dwell upon now. He was simply a flying man. All seven were. They were chosen from among 500 skilled test pilots to respond to the 1957 Soviet challenge of Sputnik and, not incidentally, it turned out, to fill a troubling void in the American psyche."
