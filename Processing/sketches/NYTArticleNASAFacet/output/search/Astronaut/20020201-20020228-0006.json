Summer camp isn't just about campfires and canoeing any more. An array of sophisticated programs offers children from grade school to high school things like filmmaking or investing, computer science or marine science. Some offer community service in faraway places; others provide college-level courses that students can take at their local campuses. (So much for a vacation from homework and report cards.)"

Jemison Doctor and Former Astronaut When I was a doctor in Sierra Leone working for the Peace Corps, I got a kitten from a family whose child was allergic to it. The kitten's name was Sneeze and Fleas, and he went everywhere with me. He was white with touches of silver and gray, and used to sit at the table with me. When I first got him he was eating the local foods, which were spicy sauces and stews over rice."
