In reporting the events, the official Soviet press agency Tass gave some of the most detailed descriptions to date on the methods and directions of the Soviet space-station program. Describing the module, known as Cosmos 1443, as a ''space tugboat,'' Tass said it was a two-part spacecraft with its own maneuvering jets and a section that could be returned to earth. The Cosmos module was said to weigh 20 tons, almost as much as the Salyut itself."

Most teachers, however, denounced President Reagan's interest in the issue as highly opportunistic, arguing that he was making political hay by criticizing them and their union, which has long been pleading for more Federal attention to education. Ada Mae Karlberg, a third-grade teacher in Bucks County, Pa., outside Philadelphia, predicted, ''Ronald Reagan will emphasize education for about as long as it helps him focus negative attention on the Democratic candidates.'' Russell D. Clayton of Newton, Iowa, an eighth-grade teacher who has been registered as a Republican for 30 years, said he voted for Mr. Reagan in 1980 but would not do so again. Of the President's campaign for excellence in education, Mr. Clayton said, ''I think he is trying to save himself, to make amends, but it's kind of late.''"

Although the N.E.A., long identified with the Democratic Party, was not specifically named in the President's speech in the Bonaventure Hotel here, it was clear that his remarks were aimed at the group, which has prepared curriculums dealing with nuclear war and racial issues. ''You stand in bright contrast to those who have promoted curriculum guides that seem to be more aimed at frightening and brainwashing American schoolchildren than at fostering learning and stimulating balanced, intelligent debate,'' Mr. Reagan told the convention, which is being attended by 2,340 delegates."

Truly flew the space shuttle Columbia to a safe landing on a dry lake bed in California two years ago he was beset by the fear that he was developing motion sickness. Indeed, at least a third of the astronauts who have flown in space have been beset by feelings of dizziness and nausea, and for centuries, many otherwise dauntless travelers, from skippers of ocean going vessels to racing car drivers, have been similarly humbled. Now, however, a new method for administering drugs, a procedure called transdermal medication, has been developed that uses neither pills nor injections but rather lets the medicine seep through the skin. It is not only helping astronauts and other travelers overcome their occasional bouts of motion sickness, disorientation and malaise. But its apparent success in that area has encouraged at least six pharmaceutical houses to work toward using transdermal medication for cancer chemotherapy, duodenal ulcers, glaucoma, asthma, allergies, hypertension and diabetes, as well as contraception."

A number of Washington organizations have been seeking a way to honor Dr. Sally K. Ride, the first American woman in space. But Dr. Ride has been insistent that she not be separated from the the rest of the Challenger's crew - Capt. Robert L. Crippen of the Navy, the commander; Capt. Frederick H. Hauck, also of the Navy, the pilot; Col. John M. Fabian of the Air Force and Dr. Norman E. Thagard, a civilian."

The eighth flight in the shuttle series will carry 250,000 of the cacheted covers ''depending on space availability,'' a space agency announcement said Tuesday."

      "lead_paragraph": "WITH the pending arrival of not one but two contemporary museums in its midst, SoHo is ripening as the center for nonprofit activity in contemporary art, a development that balances nicely its bustling commercial side. On Sept. 23, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, founded in 1976 by Marcia Tucker, will move from its outgrown 14th Street quarters to 583 Broadway, between Houston and Prince Streets, and early in 1985 Edward R. Broida, a new but very determined collector from California, will open his own museum just four blocks away in a four-story building at 130 Prince Street. The two museums will join such nonprofit SoHo institutions as the Drawing Center, the Clocktower, the Kitchen and the SoHo Center for the Visual Arts in a complex network of ''alternative'' exhibition spaces. Another alternative organization, Artists Space, is thinking of moving to SoHo, and within shouting distance, though technically in TriBeCa, are Franklin Furnace and the Alternative Museum. But the two new museums, with their collecting, archival and publishing activities, should give ballast to SoHo as an area where contemporary art may be studied in some depth, as well as viewed and purchased."
