Although they aren't planning to tie the knot (her decision), for fans of ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''The Office'' this is a marriage made in comedy heaven, with John Krasinski as the amiable Burt and Maya Rudolph as his bulging beloved, Verona."

      "lead_paragraph": "Jeremy Renner has some memorable good guys on his résumé, most notably the young fireman suffering from depression in ''Twelve and Holding.'' But he is best known for creepy triumphs like Charlize Theron's vicious enemy in ''North Country'' and the chillingly affectless serial killer in ''Dahmer.'' That sort of gift can trap an actor, but if so, Kathryn Bigelow's suspenseful Iraq war movie, ''The Hurt Locker'' (June 26), should spring Mr. Renner once and for all. Not that his Staff Sgt. William James is just one of the boys. His specialty is disarming the improvised explosive devices -- I.E.D.'s -- that have become the chief killers of troops and civilians. The work is beyond dangerous, but as Mr. Renner plays him, Sergeant James is an enthusiast for this loaded version of Russian roulette. Decked out in his bulky protective gear and formidable helmet, he bounces toward his deadly target like an astronaut on the moon about to discover something wonderful. James's enthusiasm unnerves and infuriates another sergeant (Anthony Mackie), whose task it is to guide and protect him via remote control, and when a younger soldier accuses him of putting them all at risk for an adrenaline high, we see his point. As Mr. Renner plays him, James at first seems like your basic hot dog, flashy and fearless. Certainly he savors his skill at locating and teasing apart the lethal components of the I.E.D.'s; he's dicing with death. But as the story progresses, Mr. Renner gives James a fascinating complexity of macho intensity and guarded tenderness, as well as sly humor and -- surprising in someone who takes a certain pleasure in the discomfort of other men -- a hatred of human cruelty."

She has a master of science degree from Northeastern University and is a licensed mental health counselor at Emmanuel College in Boston. In recovery from alcoholism for the last five years, she has written an enlightening new book about people like herself, ''Understanding the High-Functioning Alcoholic'' (Praeger Publishers). As Ms. Benton describes them, high-functioning alcoholics are able to maintain respectable, even high-profile lives, usually with a home, family, job and friends. That balancing act continues until something dreadful happens that reveals the truth -- to themselves or to others -- and forces the person to enter a treatment program or lose everything that means anything."

The first task of a five-day set of repair and maintenance spacewalks was to install a new camera, the Wide-Field Camera 3, on Hubble. But to get it in, astronauts had to first remove the old camera by unscrewing a seven-foot-long bolt known as the ''A'' latch, which was last moved in 1993 on the first Hubble servicing mission."

In the trilogy's first two parts, also seen at St. Ann's Warehouse, where the new show opened on Tuesday night, Ms. Hopkins slipped into the skins of Cameron Seymour, a fictional female rock star from the 1970s, and her daughter, a documentary filmmaker searching for the truth about her mother, among other characters. Ms. Hopkins used these fictional selves to explore her ideas about loss, nostalgia and the pursuit of a healthy identity -- and a viable life -- in art."

Before the Senate confirms him, it should probe how well fitted he is to guide the agency through a difficult transition from the space shuttle to follow-on vehicles designed to reach the Moon and beyond."
