Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Ben Brantley) 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS√âRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'ALL THAT I WILL EVER BE' In this false-feeling comedy-drama by Alan Ball, creator of ''Six Feet Under,'' a gay hustler undergoes an identity crisis when he finds himself falling for one of his clients. Slick but mostly stale in its analysis of a society afraid of emotional engagement (2:15). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) 'THE LAST WORD ' Oren Safdie's comedy about cultural generation gaps amuses as it goes along but lands at a predictable nowhere. Daniel J. Travanti stars as a Viennese Jew and aspiring playwright who does battle with a young student angling to become his writing assistant and find his voice (1:30). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'THE MADRAS HOUSE' A century-old drama about ''the woman question,'' this rare revival of Harley Granville Barker's fascinating play is more contemporary than you might think (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Zinoman) 'MARAT/SADE' The first New York production of Peter Weiss's classic 1963 play captures the rawness and shock of the original with a harrowing production. The inmates of this all-male asylum fling themselves against the chain-links of their enclosure; realistic-looking vomit and feces feature in one key scene; the audience is sprayed with water from the attendants' hoses and reminded that theater is not always a safe place. It's undeniably powerful; unfortunately, it remains a blunt instrument rather than a polished one, since the language is not mined as deeply as the emotion. Marat and Sade's philosophical debate, and the play's topicality, tend to be obscured by the sheer brute force of what's happening onstage (2:10). The Classical Theater of Harlem, Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 647 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie penned this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' and 'THE JEW OF MALTA' F. Murray Abraham plays two Elizabethan villains in repertory for the Theater for a New Audience. Mr. Abraham's sinister but still moving Shylock is the dark heart of Darko Tresnjak's chilly, powerful staging of one of Shakespeare's unfunniest comedies. As Barabas in David Herskovits's goofy, postmodern ''Jew of Malta,'' he's the lively center of a carnival that doesn't do justice to Christopher Marlowe's harsh satire on Christian hypocrisy and venality (each 2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00).SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Neil Genzlinger) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban) 'A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE' Courtney Baron's play suffers from a very common problem: For at least half of this one-act's running time, the characters onstage are talking to us, not one another. Paradoxically, this intimacy between audience and actors keeps the story -- an odd love affair between a woman grieving the death of her baby and the doctor involved in the baby's death -- at arm's length (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'JACKIE WITH A Z' Delectably outrageous (1:30). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'ORESTEIA' David Johnston's take on Aeschylus includes some of this irreverent playwright's trademark off-kilter sensibility but not his familiar flights of fancy (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00).Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

(Brantley) Last Chance 'ADRIFT IN MACAO' Christopher Durang wrote the book (cute) and lyrics (crude) for this fortune-cookie-size musical set in a Chinese port in the 1950s. Flimsy but fun, this spoof of old movies is lovingly acted by a swell cast, although an hour after it's over, you may be hungry for reruns of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'ART*******' Michael Domitrovich shows a good ear for dialogue in this play about five 20-somethings wallowing in the New York art scene and in their own vacuousness, but it's not quite enough to make them anything other than irritating (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'THE JADED ASSASSIN' Imagine mediocre professional wrestling mixed with ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' and you get the idea (1:15). The Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman) 'NELSON' Three arresting performances catch your attention in this creepy play by Sam Marks about a young man who is an office flunky by day but films gang videos at night. But having set a lot of intriguing things in motion, Mr. Marks is afraid to let them collide head-on (1:10). The Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 'A SPANISH PLAY' The great Zoe Caldwell returns to the New York stage after an absence of a decade, in the fine company of Linda Emond, Denis O'Hare and Larry Pine. That's the good news. The bad? The play. Yasmina Reza's pseudo-philosophical and metatheatrical trifle is utterly forgettable (1:50). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'THE ABANDONED' (R, 95 minutes) The title of this dull, hysterical horror movie seems to refer to its release strategy. The greatest mystery is why it showed up in theaters at all, rather than going straight to DVD. (A. O. Scott) 'AMAZING GRACE' (PG, 120 minutes) Michael Apted's prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce carries a strong whiff of piety but is generally pleasing and often moving, and features fine performances from newcomers and veterans alike. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE ASTRONAUT FARMER' (PG, 102 minutes) This sentimental fable about a Texas rancher who follows his dreams and builds a rocket ship in his barn is made bearable -- just -- by Billy Bob Thornton's underplayed performance in the lead role, and also by the wide-eyed visual wonderment of the director, Michael Polish, who is the co-writer of the picture with his twin brother, Mark. (Scott) 'BABEL' (R, 143 minutes, in English, Spanish, Japanese, Berber, Arabic and sign language) This hugely ambitious movie tells four loosely linked stories set on three continents. The themes, to the extent they are decipherable, include loss, fate and the terrible consequences of miscommunication. Written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez I√±√°rritu, the movie is an intellectual muddle but a visceral tour de force, and the power of the filmmaking almost overcomes the fuzziness of the ideas. Almost. (Scott) * 'BAMAKO' (No rating, 118 minutes, in French and Bambara) Abdelrahmane Sissako's new film is an indictment of the West's complicity in Africa's misery, staged as a public trial of the World Bank and its affiliates. The film's passionate didacticism is both enriched and subverted by Mr. Sissako's deft, subtle attention to the details of daily life in the capital of Mali, where the movie takes place. (Scott) 'BLOOD DIAMOND' (R, 138 minutes) The makers of this foolish thriller about illegal diamond trafficking in Africa, starring an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, want you to know there may be blood on your hands, specifically your wedding finger. Too bad they haven't thought through what it means to turn misery into entertainment. (Dargis) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent turned mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Winner of the Oscar for best picture, Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonc√© Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, who won a best-supporting-actress Oscar for her performance, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'GHOST RIDER' (PG-13, 114 minutes) After a long string of financial flops, Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcycle rider whose soul belongs to the Devil. Despite the promise of the first 30 minutes -- when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long -- a witless script and a central character who's more funny than frightening suggest that the filmmakers' franchise hopes may be dashed. (Catsoulis) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) This primer on Hannibal Lecter reduces a mythic villain to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no rush of blood to the head. (Catsoulis) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker, in an Oscar-winning performance, plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'LITTLE CHILDREN' (R, 130 minutes) Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel of suburban adultery is unfailingly intelligent and faultlessly acted. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are superb as the parents of young children who meet at the playground and enact a two-handed variation on ''Madame Bovary'' against a backdrop of social paranoia and middle-class malaise. (Scott) * 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor. (Dargis) * 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature, winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich M√ºhe's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'NOTES ON A SCANDAL' (R, 92 minutes) Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett play a misogynistic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including the audience. Adapted by Patrick Marber from a novel by Zo√´ Heller and directed by Richard Eyre. (Dargis) 'THE NUMBER 23' (R, 95 minutes) An accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) How you respond to this fairy tale in realist drag may depend on whether you find Will Smith's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. (Dargis) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren (who won an Oscar) in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'RENO 911!: MIAMI' (R, 81 minutes) The title more or less says all you need to know about the story, the action and the point. (Dargis) 'STARTER FOR TEN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) This amiable, nostalgic British comedy tackles a lofty subject -- the allure of knowledge --with down-to-earth charm, following a working-class kid (James McAvoy) during his first year at Bristol University and an appearance on the TV quiz show ''University Challenge.'' But beneath the formulaic embarrassments and fumbled learning curve lurks a more somber theme: the inevitable rupture between those who pursue an education and those left behind. (Catsoulis) 'VENUS' (R, 91 minutes) A modest, diverting, touching tale of a young woman who attracts the interest -- avuncular and also erotic -- of an aging actor, played with effortless aplomb by the great Peter O'Toole. (Scott) * 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almod√≥var, with Pen√©lope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott) 'THE WAYWARD CLOUD' (No rating, 112 minutes, in Mandarin) The latest from the Taiwanese filmmaker Tsai Ming-Liang is a musical, with very little dialogue and a good deal of explicit sex. Unfortunately, Mr. Tsai's energetic provocation, a notable contrast to his usual rigorous, dryly kinky style, seems more like a sign of artistic frustration than like an audacious new direction. (Scott) Film Series FRENCH SEVENTIES: CINEMA AFTER MAY '68 (Tuesday) The protests of May 1968 left an indelible mark on French society and French cinema, a link that will be explored in a series of screenings organized by Jean-Michel Frodon, the editor in chief of Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma. The program begins on Tuesday with ''Le Diable Probablement,'' Robert Bresson's dark 1977 look at the lives of Parisian students fatally disenchanted with the adult world. The 7 p.m. screening, which has a special admission price of $12, will be followed by a question-and-answer session with Mr. Frodon and the director Beno√Æt Jacquot (whose ''Assassin Musicien'' will be shown on March 13). French Institute/Alliance Fran√ßaise, Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf.org; $9. (Dave Kehr) ABBAS KIAROSTAMI: 'IMAGE MAKER' (Today through Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art asserts that this 33-film retrospective of the work of the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami is the most complete examination of his career yet mounted in the United States. Mr. Kiarostami's minimalist aesthetics and deeply felt humanism make for a rare and profound combination, as demonstrated in masterworks like ''Close-Up'' (1990) (screening on Monday) and ''Through the Olive Trees'' (1994) (Wednesday). This weekend's programs concentrate on the first part of Mr. Kiarostami's career, when he was making short educational films for children under the auspices of the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults in Iran, and includes his first feature-length film, the 1974 ''The Traveler'' (tonight). Meanwhile, Mr. Kiarostami's 2006 video installation ''Five'' will play continuously in MoMA's Yoshiko and Akio Morita Gallery, and an exhibition of his photographs will continue at MoMA's Queens ally, P.S. 1. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr) 'OUT 1' (Tomorrow and Sunday) When the Museum of the Moving Image presented all 12 and a half hours of Jacques Rivette's famously hard-to-see French film, ''Out 1,'' last fall, it proved to be one of the movie events of the year, and even won the museum a special citation from the National Society of Film Critics. This weekend, the museum is offering an encore presentation of this fascinating, unwieldy film, which revolves around the on- and offstage lives of avant-garde actors in Paris. The first four episodes will be shown tomorrow, starting at 2 p.m., with a dinner break at 5:30 (box dinner available by advance order); the final four at 2 p.m. on Sunday. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $32 for both days. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. BATTLEFIELD BAND (Monday) Old-fashioned bagpipes and whistles and up-to-date synthesizers drive the Battlefield Band, which has been having its way with traditional and traditionalist songs since it was founded three decades ago in Scotland. At 7:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Jon Pareles) THE BIRD AND THE BEE (Tonight) The Bird and the Bee, a well-dressed duo from Los Angeles, toys with two fashionable ideas: retro French pop glittering with electronics, and ''Sex and the City''-style sexual conundrums. The singer Inara George mulls the ways of noncommittal boyfriends and promises in a catwalk soprano -- to herself or a man, it's never clear -- ''I would be so winning, so absolutely winning.'' With Foreign Islands. At 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Ben Sisario) * SOLOMON BURKE (Sunday) Solomon Burke is a larger-than-life, gospel-rooted 1960s soul man whose vocal jabs taught Mick Jagger, among others, a few things about singing. He is still a vocal powerhouse, full of dramatic whims, who earns the right to perform from a throne. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $35 in advance, $37 at the door. (Pareles) MARC COHN (Thursday) His 1991 hit ''Walking in Memphis'' sums up Marc Cohn's style: smoothly rolling chords; a supple, soul-inflected voice; and a kindly outlook. He has been known to sing not only his songs but also his stage patter. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; sold out. (Pareles) * JUDY COLLINS (Tonight) What Ms. Collins brings to a song , whether she wrote it or not, is perspective. You have the sense of a woman standing alone in the night air, gazing at a star and directing a beam of psychic energy into the cosmos. Or maybe she is the receiver of this cool, steady light; it cuts both ways. At 8:45, Caf√© Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $100 cover at tables, $65 at the bar. (Stephen Holden) ROB DICKINSON (Tonight) In the '90s Mr. Dickinson led the Catherine Wheel, a British band that created a muscular, dramatic sweep with fogs of guitar noise. He has since refashioned himself as a cynical balladeer in the Warren Zevon mode, the kind who may or may not be sarcastic when saying that the secret to life is merely ''to smile and hang out with intelligent people.'' At 7:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario) GOMEZ, BEN KWELLER (Thursday) Gomez emerged in the heyday of '90s Britpop with an against-the-grain obsession with tight, sharp blues-rock. On its latest album, ''How We Operate'' (ATO), the band has veered into folkier realms, but still plays with unusual precision and focus. Ben Kweller survived his time as a teenage rock prodigy and has carved out a niche as an ambitious singer-songwriter, playing all the instruments on his latest, self-titled album. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $28 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) NANCI GRIFFITH (Tuesday and Wednesday) A Texas songwriter with an affinity for acoustic guitars, little-girl vocals and life's small but resonant epiphanies, Ms. Griffith stepped way out of character on her newest album, ''Ruby's Torch'' (Rounder), immersing herself in the dramatic sweep of ''In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning'' and torch songs by Jimmy Webb and Tom Waits. For her Blue Note debut, the club promises that she will be going the distance with the new role, appearing in a red velvet dress and singing into ''an old-school hanging mic.'' At 8 and 10:30 p.m., 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar; $5 minimum. (Sisario) * GRIZZLY BEAR (Tuesday and Wednesday) The acoustic guitars, strings, brushed percussion and library voices say cozy folk, but the enormous ambition of this Brooklyn band pushes its dreamlike, bewitching songs past psychedelia and prog and into uncharted realms. With Beach House and the Papercuts. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) IZZYS (Tomorrow) With a repertory of lean, uncomplicated blues-boogies, this New York band worships at the twin retro-rock altars of the Rolling Stones and the Stooges (with a little Gram Parsons country thrown in as well). At 11 p.m., Lakeside Lounge, 162 Avenue B, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 529-8463, lakesidelounge.com; free. (Sisario) ESSIE JAIN (Tuesday) A British singer and songwriter who lives in New York, Ms. Jain builds stark miniatures out of a few light strums of guitar and her haunting alto. On her captivating new album, ''We Made This Ourselves'' (Ba Da Bing), her voice is multitracked in precise harmonies that can be warm or ghostly. With Pepi Ginsberg and the Lost Americans. At 8 p.m., Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $7. (Sisario) * CHARLIE LOUVIN, LAURA CANTRELL (Thursday) Four years ago the Nashville establishment offered its obeisance to the Louvin Brothers, the close-harmony country-gospel duo from Arkansas whose influence was greater than their record sales: a tribute album, ''Livin', Lovin', Losin','' with Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Johnny Cash and others, which won a Grammy. Now it's the alterna-crowd's turn. The new, self-titled album by Charlie Louvin (his brother and partner, Ira, died in 1965), fragile of voice but not of spirit at age 79, features Elvis Costello and members of Wilco, Bright Eyes, Lambchop and Clem Snide in spare, affectionate duets. Laura Cantrell, the sweetheart of the alt-country rodeo, opens the show. At 8 p.m., Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $16.50 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) MOONLIGHTERS (Monday) Few would expect members of Helmet and the Pain Teens to play ukulele-strumming, steel-guitar-sliding, sweetly harmonized, optimistic Hawaiian-style songs. But the Moonlighters do just that, writing anachronistic ballads and swing-style tunes that Bliss Blood sings without a hint of campiness. At 10 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500, rodeobar.com; free. (Pareles) NICKELBACK (Monday) This quartet of Marlboro men from the tiny Canadian prairie town of Hanna, Alberta, scored the fourth-best-selling album of 2006 with ''All the Right Reasons'' (Roadrunner), whose painfully ordinary commercial rock has one big (and super-popular) standout: ''Photograph,'' a post-grunge ballad the way Ray Davies would write one, tangy and reflective. With Three Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin. At 7 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $41.50 and $51.50. (Sisario) * ELVIS PERKINS (Sunday) Having established himself on the singer-songwriter circuit with a discursive acoustic style derived from groups like Clem Snide, Mr. Perkins has finally released his bittersweet and beautiful debut album, ''Ash Wednesday'' (XL). He began it in 2002, a decade after his father, the actor Anthony Perkins, died of AIDS, and a year after his mother, the fashion photographer Berry Berenson Perkins, died in one of the planes that was crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. With Patrick Watson. At 7:30 p.m., Luna Lounge, 361 Metropolitan Avenue, at Havemeyer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, lunalounge.com; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. (Sisario) RADIO 4, TEDDYBEARS (Tonight) Radio 4 was among the first local bands to mine the frantic dance-punk of early-'80s groups like the Gang of Four and Public Image Ltd., which it does studiously but not very imaginatively. The Teddybears, from Sweden, have one of the year's bigger head-scratchers with ''Punkrocker,'' a paranoid jaunt with new-wave synthesizers and a deadpan vocal by Iggy Pop that is being used in a Cadillac ad -- makes perfect sense, right? At 11:30, Studio B, 259 Banker Street, between Meserole Avenue and Calyer Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-1880, clubstudiob.com; $10. (Sisario) IKE REILLY ASSASSINATION (Tonight) An eloquent wiseguy whose songs evoke Bob Dylan and Paul Westerberg, Mr. Reilly, a former bellhop and gravedigger from Chicago, has the kind of high-energy, hook-heavy folk-rock sound that turns every head in a bar, while his nasal vocals are unsparingly sardonic: ''The friends that you rely on are the train tracks that you lie on.'' At midnight, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660, mopitkins.com; $15. (Sisario) SCISSOR SISTERS (Tomorrow) You would be forgiven if you didn't know this was one of the most popular New York City bands in the world: despite Top 10 success in Britain with its almost parodically falsetto-heavy disco-soul, the Scissor Sisters have struggled for attention at home. Its main songwriters, the singer Jake Shears and the bassist Babbydaddy, can crank out some very entertaining dance-floor anthems, but as its latest album, ''Ta-Dah'' (Universal), makes clear, this sound can go on forever without much development, and the Bee Gees and George Michael wrote better songs. At 8 p.m., the Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $41. (Sisario) STEEL PULSE (Tuesday) The close harmonies and steadfast reggae beats of Steel Pulse have carried righteous sentiments about topics including revolution, dancing, Rastafarianism and racist taxi drivers. With Lionize. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $28 in advance, $30 at the door.

(Sisario) * THERMALS (Sunday and Monday) A lo-fi but high-energy and high-volume indie band from Portland, Ore., the Thermals have the rare distinction -- maybe soon to be less rare in this post-''Inconvenient Truth'' era -- of refusing $50,000 to license a song for a Hummer commercial. (''What would you be making an ad for,'' the singer Hutch Harris told the Web site Pitchfork, ''a new tank that people can drive down the street?'') With the Big Sleep.

Opera * 'EUGENE ONEGIN' (Tomorrow) The final performance this season of the Metropolitan Opera's affecting revival of its 1997 production of Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin'' comes tomorrow night. In his first Met performances of the title role, the charismatic Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky is riveting, singing with earthy richness and fully conveying this worldly, entitled and dashing young man's aloofness, until the final tragic scene. The surprises come from the soprano Ren√©e Fleming, in her first Russian role at the Met, who gives a vocally exquisite and vulnerable portrayal of Tatiana, and the tenor Ram√≥n Vargas, a Bel Canto specialist, who makes an ardent and endearing Lenski, Onegin's well-meaning but fatally impulsive friend. You will seldom see better acting in opera than from this excellent cast. Taking over for Valery Gergiev, Paul Nadler conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Some people, faced with a theater that seats 100 people, would stage chamber opera. But the tiny Amato Opera endears precisely because it refuses to recognize realistic limits, preferring to lose itself in a haze of opera idolatry. This weekend, therefore, it brings back its staging of one of Verdi's largest works, for some of Verdi's largest singers; probably a few people in the company's perennially rotating casts will even do the spirit of the music justice. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) * 'DIE MEISTERSINGER VON N√úRNBERG' (Monday) Otto Schenk's stylistically realistic and captivating 1993 production of Wagner's humanely comic masterpiece is back in the repertory. That this score is a James Levine specialty is just one reason to expect the best from this revival. The veteran bass James Morris, acclaimed for his affecting portrayal of the wise and conflicted shoemaker Hans Sachs, is back, along with the powerhouse tenor Johan Botha as the young knight Walther, a role he has sung splendidly at the house. Branching out, the fine soprano Hei-Kyung Hong sings Eva for the first time at the Met. At 6 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175.

(Bernard Holland) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Wednesday) For its revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta this season. The earthy Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova, who made her Met debut in 2001 and who was recently heard at the house as Nedda in ''Pagliacci,'' sings Violetta, the role of her debut. The compelling German tenor Jonas Kaufmann sings Alfredo, Violetta's impulsive lover, with the veteran American baritone Dwayne Croft as Alfredo's tragically interfering father, Germont. Marco Armiliato conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $65 to $175. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFL√ñTE' (Tonight and Thursday) The revival of Julie Taymor's production of Mozart's ''Zauberfl√∂te'' continues at the Met, complete with the magical puppets and stage effects that made it an audience hit when it opened in 2004.

(Schweitzer) MUSIC FROM JAPAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Joji Yuasa is a veteran composer; an erstwhile colleague of Takemitsu; a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego; and the subject of a retrospective tomorrow that will include a world premiere. The biwa is a kind of lute (not unlike the Chinese pipa), which the player-singer Junko Tahara has formed into a distinctive ensemble that will perform everything from a brand-new work by Masataka Matsuo to a medieval epic called ''The Tale of the Heike'' on Sunday afternoon.

On Monday a program at Zankel Hall called ''Thomas Quasthoff and the Art of Song'' will showcase some of his best current students in Berlin; on Wednesday he takes the main stage with a jazz combo for a concert of his own.

(Midgette) * MICHAEL SCHADE (Tuesday) The dulcet-voiced Swiss-born tenor Michael Schade, an artist especially noted for his Mozart roles in the opera house, is also an elegant lieder singer. For his unusual song recital at Zankel Hall with the pianist Malcolm Martineau, Mr. Schade will focus on the German Romantic poet Joseph von Eichendorff, as set to music by Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms and Wolf. While in New York, Mr. Schade is also appearing as Tamino in the Metropolitan Opera's production of ''Die Zauberfl√∂te.'' At 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $36 to $42. (Tommasini) VIENNA PHILHARMONIC (Tonight through Sunday) These days the Vienna Philharmonic is as famous for its resistance to hiring women as for its playing, but let's not forget that purely as a music-making machine, it's a glorious thing. Daniel Barenboim leads it in three concerts: Schubert and Bruckner symphonies tonight; all Bartok (including the Second Piano Concerto with Lang Lang) tomorrow; and the Schumann Fourth Symphony and orchestral music from Wagner operas on Sunday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $51 to $200. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. LES BALLETS TROCKADERO DE MONTE CARLO (Tomorrow and Sunday) This zany all-male troupe of ballerinas will perform at two New York-area theaters this weekend. The ballerhinos invade Princeton tomorrow at 8 p.m. McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787, mccarter.org; $32 to $38. Then they will chass√© on to Newark for a performance on Sunday at 3 p.m. New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Jennifer Dunning) * DANCE AT DNA (Tomorrow and Thursday) Amy Pivar, known for brainy, powerfully emotional choreography, teams up tomorrow with the mezzo-soprano Elaine Valby and the composer-performers Paula M. Kimper and Gilda Lyons for the latest installment in a five-year collaboration. The musical texts include poetry by Paul Bowles and a setting in Hebrew of the 23rd Psalm. Sharing the program are Alexandra Shilling and Ann Robideaux, who create a surreal landscape in their new ''Long Night.'' And tomorrow afternoon, six choreographers will participate in the theater's informal Works in Progress series, which consists of excerpted dance and audience feedback. Bridgman-Packer Dance will follow on Thursday, through March 11, in a dance that explores the concept of ''video partnering,'' as Art Bridgman and Myrna Packer put it. Their video collaborators are Peter Bobrow, Jim Monroe and Matthias Oostrik. On hand to provide the live music will be Robert Een, Ken Field and Glen Velez. ''Works in Progress,'' tomorrow at 5:30 p.m., $10 suggested donation; Pivar tomorrow at 8 p.m., $17; Bridgman-Packer Thursday at 8 p.m., $25. Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org. (Dunning) Philippe Decoufl√© (Tuesday through Thursday) This French choreographer is well known for his wonderfully entertaining and often poetic large-scale productions that blend dance, circus, music hall and theater. It's a surprise to find him performing a solo, called ''Solo: Le Doute M'Habite'' (''I Am Filled With Doubt''), but there are likely to be visual tricks, humor and theatrical magic aplenty. (Through March 11.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $38; $29 for Joyce members. (Roslyn Sulcas) THE 4 TANGO SEASONS (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This show explores nature's cycles as seen through a man and a woman in love. (Through April 1.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880, thaliatheatre.org; $30; $27 for students and 65+; all tickets $25 tonight and Thursday. (Dunning) Sally Gross and Company (Tonight through Sunday night) There are a few choreographers who epitomize a certain kind of downtown spirit: dedicated, talented and tenacious. One is Ms. Gross, who has been making austere, economical dances since the 1960s and still has much to say. Two new works, ''The Pleasure of Stillness'' and ''Songs,'' a solo for Ms. Gross, are on the program, along with two pieces from last year; ''With Music #2'' and ''With Words #2.'' At 8, Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org; $15. (Sulcas) MIGUEL GUTIERREZ AND THE POWERFUL PEOPLE (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) In his new ''Everyone,'' Mr. Gutierrez examines the always topical issue of how and why a dance may be made in a world filled with incoherent current events. (Through March 11.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30, Sunday at 3 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m. Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, abronsartscenter.org; $20, $10 for students; $50 for gala program and reception on Wednesday. (Dunning) Marcia Milhazes Dance Company (Thursday) Marcia Milhazes danced with Maurice Bejart and studied at the Laban Center in London before returning to her native Brazil in 1994. Her company makes its New York debut with ''Tempo de Ver√£o (Summertime),'' which a recent article in Dance Magazine described as ''cultured and trendy.'' Which could be good. (Through March 10.) At 7.30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6500, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, 65+ and artists. (Sulcas) * 92nd STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow, Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) Joe Chvala and the Flying Foot Forum, a percussive-dance group from Minneapolis-St. Paul, creates rhythmic patterns with taps, found objects and vocalizing, tomorrow and Sunday. The festival continues on Wednesday with performances by the Dusan Tynek Dance Theater. Mr. Tynek, a Czech-born choreographer, has a style that is vivid and quirky in a quietly powerful folk-art way, in dances that address decidedly unusual themes. His new ''Fleur-de-lis,'' for example, a three-part reimagining of religious paintings and the emotions contained in them, is a dance set to music by the Baroque composer Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber. Joe Chvala and the Flying Foot Forum, tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Dusan Tynek Dance Theater, Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500, 92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) ROYSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tomorrow and Sunday) Robert Royston's new ''StreetSwing'' draws on his experiences as a multiple winner of the ballroom championships in United States Open Swing Dance and World Country Dance. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 760-0064, queenstheatre.org; $37; $33 for 65+; $20 for students. (Dunning) * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The company opens its spring season tonight with the lush ''Roses,'' the jaunty yet sad ''Company B'' and Mr. Taylor's new ''Lines of Loss,'' a meditation on different kinds of loss set to eight pieces of music by composers including Guillaume de Machaut and John Cage. Popular Taylor favorites to be performed this week are the haunting ''Sunset'' (tomorrow and Wednesday nights) and the sexy and funny tango piece ''Piazzolla Caldera'' (tomorrow night), and the death-defying yet serene ''Esplanade'' (Sunday afternoon and Wednesday night). Another of the week's highlights promises to be a one-time performance of Mr. Taylor's ''Aureole,'' that luminous 1962 modern-dance classic, on Tuesday in a gala program that also includes the premiere of ''Troilus and Cressida (reduced).'' The new work may well represent the choreographer at his most wicked, set as it is to music by Ponchielli (the well-known tune for Allan Sherman's novelty song ''Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh!''). (Through March 18.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday at 7 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $15 to $125. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MART√≠N RAM√≠REZ, through April 29. Ram√≠rez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ram√≠rez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith) * Asia Society: Glass, Gilding, and Grand Design: Art of Sasanian Iran (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. This glinting, glowing show is a reduction of a much larger Paris exhibition that included material from Iranian museums impossible to bring to the United States. But with some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, it is still substantial and the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. (Holland Cotter) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. This show sounds ripe with possibilities. The results, however, are more mixed. The exhibition is drawn from the museum's collection, which explains some of its exclusions and limitations. Many artists you associate with contemporary photography and the family are not in attendance: Richard Bellingham, Tina Barney, Malerie Marder. There is also a sense of false advertising in the exhibition's title. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. A good portion of the work falls under this rubric. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children (now grown), has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, and her choice of family as the central focus of artistic practice, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones, having dissected them for his famous study ''The Anatomy of the Horse'' (1766). He's best known for his views of aristocratic race horses, seen purely as beautiful animals with no attempt at anthropomorphosis, but he painted other mammals too, dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers raking and reaping grain, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700. (Grace Glueck) International Center of Photography: 'Henri Cartier-Bresson's Scrapbook: Photographs, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the original layout of the scrapbook. It's an eye-straining affair, but it surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) International Center of Photography: 'Martin Munkacsi: Think While You Shoot!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * The METropOlitan museum of art: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck) * Morgan Library & Museum: 'Private Treasures: Four Centuries of European Master Drawings,' through April 8. This show is drawn entirely from an anonymous private collection. Despite the veil of secrecy, a couple of things are obvious: the collector had significant capital for investing in old masters and either an exceptional eye or a good adviser (or both). The works span more than 400 years, from the 16th to the early 20th century, and include drawings in ink and pencil, watercolor, chalk and gouache. The earliest works come from a period when drawing wasn't an autonomous practice but was used as a form of exercise, to apply one's craft, to experiment and to make preliminary sketches for larger works. The best example -- and the most historically significant work here -- is a black chalk drawing, ''The Dead Christ'' (1529-35), by Agnolo Bronzino. With more than 90 drawings in the show, being a diligent observer quickly becomes exhausting. In which case, put down the guide, find a few drawings you like, and enjoy them while you can. After all, you don't know where they came from, where they're going, or when you'll see them again. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org. (Schwendener) Museum of Modern Art: 'Artistic Collaborations: 50 Years of Universal Limited Art Editions,' through May 21. This exhibition marks the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art: The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, mostly from the 1960s, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It's hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener) * MOMA: Armando Rever√ìn, through April 16. Unless you spotted his single smoke-puff of a painting at MoMA months ago, Armando Rever√≥n probably means nothing to you. Why should he? The artist, who died in 1954, spent most of his life in a shack by the sea in his native Venezuela. Many of his contemporaries dismissed him as nuts. His white-on-white pictures are practically unphotographable. But chances are that if you visit this retrospective, you'll find yourself thinking about him a lot. His art and his story are like few others, and so is the museum's inspired installation: a single, longcorridor with cabinetlike rooms of paintings on either side and, at the very end, against a sea-green wall, a life-size doll with giant bat wings floating overhead. (See above.) (Cotter) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this brave if confused exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal in their way to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins, mixing generations and levels of achievement and continuing the neglect of the main story. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea * BAKER OVERSTREET: NEW PAINTINGS Like Keegan McHargue and Devendra Banhart, this young artist has a penchant for tribal motifs, which he flattens into symmetrical compositions and renders with an outsider roughness. The works in his debut show evoke the imagery of the space-ship-obsessed, self-taught artist Ionel Talpazan, as well as Alfred Jensen and Forrest Bess. Their notion of the visionary is both self conscious and familiar, but they are painted with energetic dispatch and a sure sense of scale, color and wit that encourages you to stay tuned. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through March 17. (Smith) Last Chance Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,' Dia:Beacon, a bulwark of Minimalism on the banks of the Hudson River north of Manhattan, has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Ms. Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, www.diacenter.org; closes on Monday. (Cotter) * MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,' A cartoonist-artist extraordinaire, Saul Steinberg (1914-99) was a veritable Leonardo of graphic drollery. His famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 Steinberg drawings, collages and constructions goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa (and possibly influenced by his growing interest in underground comix), a premonitory take on the precarious situation of the world today. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck) * Spectral Evidence This group show, organized by the sharp young artist Steven Lam, is about the hard shell of illusion that surrounds official history, and about art's attempt to crack open that shell. These histories range from lynchings and United States government surveillance in the 1930s, to propaganda and the Vietnam War in the 1960s, to the destruction of the Buddhist sculptures at Bamiyan in the 2000s. Terry Adkins, Jill Godmilow, Sreshta Rit Premnath and Elaine Reichek are among the artists who explore the authenticity of ''facts'' woven from ideology and desire. Rotunda Gallery, 33 Clinton Street, near Pierrepont Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 875-4047; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)"

Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS√âRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in rural Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) Off Broadway 'BFF' It is certainly possible to make fine art out of childhood experiences, but this play about two ''best friends forever'' smacks of an after-school special. It jumps back and forth between the friendship of two 11-year-old girls as they grow and grow apart, and the life of one of those girls 10 or so years later. The actors (including Sasha Eden and Laura Heisler) do a good job of conveying childhood. But it boils down to a story of 20-somethings needlessly complicating their lives -- something that may be credible, but is not necessarily interesting. (1:30). DR2, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette) 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of Jos√© Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald, and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'THE MADRAS HOUSE' A century-old drama about ''the woman question,'' this rare revival of Harley Granville Barker's fascinating play is more contemporary than you might think (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 315-0231. (Jason Zinoman) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie penned this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BAAL' The director Charmian Creagle's bright idea for staging Bertolt Brecht's often offensive first play -- about a poet and singer who is a monster of appetite -- was to cast the title role as a woman. The production is so poorly acted and drearily directed, however, that the casting does nothing to illuminate the play or open a meaningful inquiry into habitual reactions to it (2:15). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 307-9467. (Kalb) 'CONFIDENCE, WOMEN!' Robert Cucuzza's period piece about swindlers, liars and prostitutes is surprisingly sedate (1:30).

(Brantley) Last Chance 'ALL THAT I WILL EVER BE' In this false-feeling comedy-drama by Alan Ball, creator of ''Six Feet Under,'' a gay hustler undergoes an identity crisis when he finds himself falling for one of his clients. Slick but mostly stale in its analysis of a society afraid of emotional engagement (2:15). The New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'THE APPLE TREE' The amazing Kristin Chenoweth gives Imax-screen-size life to three curvaceous doodles who by rights shouldn't be any larger than figures in the Sunday funnies. Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's 1966 musical, directed by Gary Griffin, shows its age but is given theatrical verve by Ms. Chenoweth, Brian d'Arcy James and Marc Kudisch (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300; closes on Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE FEVER' Wallace Shawn performs his provocative monologue about a guilt-riddled bourgeois everyman sweating his way through a moral crisis. The rich, often hypnotic writing draws us into his tortured mindscape, as he shifts between shame over his sense of entitlement and reasoned arguments that sacrifice is unnecessary and pointless. Meanwhile, in the third world, the violence and poverty continue unabated (1:30). Acorn Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes tonight. (Isherwood) 'GOODNESS' ''Why do good people rush to do evil,'' Michael wants to know. ''And what do they become?'' The second question is the most daunting for a play, but the clarity of Michael Redhill's language, the economy of Ross Manson's direction and the excellent cast succeed in dramatizing its complexities. The haunting score sung a capella is based on folk songs from ''as far north as the Ukraine and as far south as Zimbabwe'' (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at East Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Honor Moore) 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' and 'THE JEW OF MALTA' F. Murray Abraham plays two Elizabethan villains in repertory for the Theater for a New Audience. Mr. Abraham's sinister but still moving Shylock is the dark heart of Darko Tresnjak's chilly, powerful staging of one of Shakespeare's unfunniest comedies. As Barabas in David Herskovits's goofy, postmodern ''Jew of Malta,'' he's the lively center of a carnival that doesn't do justice to Christopher Marlowe's harsh satire on Christian hypocrisy and venality (each 2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood) 'ORESTEIA' David Johnston's take on Aeschylus includes some of this irreverent playwright's trademark off-kilter sensibility but not his familiar flights of fancy (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE' Courtney Baron's play suffers from a very common problem: For at least half of this one-act's running time, the characters onstage are talking to us, not one another. Paradoxically, this intimacy between audience and actors keeps the story -- an odd love affair between a woman grieving the death of her baby and the doctor involved in the baby's death -- at arm's length (1:20). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'THE ABANDONED' (R, 95 minutes) The title of this dull, hysterical horror movie seems to refer to its release strategy. The greatest mystery is why it showed up in theaters at all, rather than going straight to DVD. (A. O. Scott) 'AMAZING GRACE' (PG, 120 minutes) Michael Apted's prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce carries a strong whiff of piety but is generally pleasing and often moving, and features fine performances from newcomers and veterans alike. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE ASTRONAUT FARMER' (PG, 102 minutes) This sentimental fable about a Texas rancher who follows his dreams and builds a rocket ship in his barn is made bearable -- just -- by Billy Bob Thornton's underplayed performance in the lead role, and also by the wide-eyed visual wonderment of the director, Michael Polish, who is the co-writer of the picture with his twin brother, Mark. (Scott) * 'BAMAKO' (No rating, 118 minutes, in French and Bambara) Abdelrahmane Sissako's new film is an indictment of the West's complicity in Africa's misery, staged as a public trial of the World Bank and its affiliates. The film's passionate didacticism is both enriched and subverted by Mr. Sissako's deft, subtle attention to the details of daily life in the capital of Mali, where the movie takes place. (Scott) 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN' (R, 116 minutes) Christina Ricci as a Tennessee nymphomaniac and Samuel Jackson as the blues singer who tries to cure her by fastening her half-naked self to his radiator with a chain. In spite of that summary, it's mostly corny uplift, from Craig Brewer, who also wrote and directed the down-home pimp fairy tale ''Hustle & Flow.'' (Scott) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent-turned-mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'THE CATS OF MIRIKITANI' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Japanese) Linda Hattendorf's remarkable documentary follows her growing friendship with a homeless artist from her New York City neighborhood. Born in Sacramento in 1920 and raised in Hiroshima, Jimmy Tsutomu Mirikitani relives his painful past with vivid paintings of internment camps and blood-red cities. When his health is threatened by the dust clouds of Sept. 11, Ms. Hattendorf moves him into her home, and what began as an interesting portrait of an outsider artist becomes a fascinating story of injustice and endurance. (Catsoulis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Winner of the Oscar for best picture, Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonc√© Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, who won a best-supporting-actress Oscar for her performance, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'GHOST RIDER' (PG-13, 114 minutes) After a long string of financial flops, Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcycle rider whose soul belongs to the Devil. Despite the promise of the first 30 minutes -- when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long -- a witless script and a central character who's more funny than frightening suggest that the filmmakers' franchise hopes may be dashed. (Catsoulis) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) This primer on Hannibal Lecter reduces a mythic villain to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no rush of blood to the head. (Catsoulis) * 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gr√∂ning's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker, in an Oscar-winning performance, plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature, winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film, takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich M√ºhe's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'THE NUMBER 23' (R, 95 minutes) An accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren (who won an Oscar) in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'RENO 911!: MIAMI' (R, 81 minutes) The title more or less says all you need to know about the story, the action and the point. (Dargis) 'ROCK BOTTOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) This graphic documentary by Jay Corcoran is a strong, scary examination of the crystal methedrine epidemic among gay men in New York. (Stephen Holden) 'STARTER FOR TEN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) This amiable, nostalgic British comedy tackles a lofty subject -- the allure of knowledge --with down-to-earth charm, following a working-class kid (James McAvoy) during his first year at Bristol University and an appearance on the TV quiz show ''University Challenge.'' But beneath the formulaic embarrassments and fumbled learning curve lurks a more somber theme: the inevitable rupture between those who pursue an education and those left behind. (Catsoulis) 'TWO WEEKS' (R, 102 minutes) Sally Field creates a powerful portrait of a middle-aged North Carolina woman tended by her family, as she succumbs to ovarian cancer. This well-intentioned film is contaminated by its detours into sitcom humor. (Holden) 'WILD HOGS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Tame slop. (Scott) 'WILD TIGERS I HAVE KNOWN' (No rating, 81 minutes) A lonely 13-year-old boy's awakening to his own homosexuality is evoked in Cam Archer's tender, excessively arty cinematic poem. (Holden) * 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts. (Dargis) Film Series CANADIAN FRONT 2007 (Wednesday and Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art presents eight new features from Canada in its fourth annual survey of filmmaking up north. Wednesday's opening attractions are ''Remembering Arthur,'' a documentary by Martin Lavut about the Canadian experimental filmmaker Arthur Lipsett, and ''Away From Her,'' a drama directed by the actress Sarah Polley about a long-married couple (Julie Christie and Gordon Pinset) faced with the onset of Alzheimer's disease. There are six more films in the series, which runs through March 18. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) RENDEZ-VOUS WITH FRENCH CINEMA 2007 (Tonight through Sunday) Perennially popular and frequently sold out, this annual series sponsored by the French film export union, Unifrance, continues this week at both uptown (the Walter Reade Theater) and downtown locations (The IFC Center), with a wide-ranging mix of commercial and art house movies. This weekend's features suggest some of the spread: ''Murderers,'' directed by Patrick Grandperret, is a New Wavish road movie about two teenagers who escape from a psychiatric institution and take their love on the road; ''I Do'' stars one of France's most popular comedians, Alain Chabat, in the tale of a toxic bachelor whose family forces him into a series of hideous blind dates. Saturday brings ''The Untouchable,'' the new feature by the prolific and always provocative Beno√Æt Jacquot (''Seventh Heaven''), with the ravishing Isild Le Besco as an actress who discovers a life-changing secret about her parentage. And the great craftsman of French boulevard comedy, Francis Veber (''The Dinner Game''), returns with ''The Valet,'' a farce about a parking lot attendant (Gad Elmaleh) who is hired by a wealthy industrialist (Daniel Auteuil) to act as a beard for the millionaire's mistress (Alice Taglioni). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $10.75. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ANTIBALAS (Tomorrow) Antibalas delivers a New York makeover to Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, the Nigerian funk propelled by burly saxophones, fierce percussion and righteous anger. At 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Jon Pareles) * ANTONY AND THE JOHNSONS (Tonight) Orchestras are always scheming to attract ''young people'' (that is, people under 50), and the Brooklyn Philharmonic has come up with a smart idea, presenting serious pop artists backed with something special: an orchestra. Tonight is Antony, the quivering, androgynous prince of woe. At 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, brooklynphilharmonic.org; $25 to $105. (Ben Sisario) AQUALUNG (Monday) Matt Hales, the piano-playing Briton who records as Aqualung, borrows all the most tedious and indulgent aspects of Coldplay and Radiohead -- the slow-motion brooding, the epic self-pity -- while missing their joyful grandeur. With Sarah Bareilles. At 7 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 371 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-0212, bowerypresents.com; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) THE BRAVERY (Monday) Disco first met punk in Britain in the late '70s, but they have had quite a romance in turn-of-the-21st-century New York. The Bravery arrived a couple of years ago with catchy, radio-ready songs and buckets of hair gel; the band has been compared, accurately, to the Strokes, New Order, U2 and Franz Ferdinand. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * CLINIC (Tonight) Dressed in surgical masks, this Liverpool band plays jabby, frantic rock with spikes of guitar noise and a beat that sounds like a countdown to something terrible. It's an invasive procedure, but when it gets going it's impossible to look away. At 8:30, Gramercy Theater, 127 East 23rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $18.50. (Sisario) STEVE EARLE (Monday and Tuesday) Steve Earle's America is a place full of mavericks, outcasts and stubborn hope. His voice is scarred and raspy, and his band is well rooted and far-reaching, playing generous sets that range across country and rock, from bluegrass to psychedelia. He makes his Blue Note debut with his new wife, the country-rocker Allison Moorer. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $25 at the bar; $5 minimum. (Pareles) FAB FAUX (Tuesday and Wednesday) There are Beatles tribute acts, and then there are Beatles tribute acts. This one, featuring the bassist Will Lee (of the ''Late Show With David Letterman'' band) and the guitarist Jimmy Vivino (from ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien''), recreates even the most complex studio work of the later Beatles without breaking a sweat. For these two concerts, it takes on some of the Beatles' solo work. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $35. (Sisario) GOMEZ, BEN KWELLER (Tonight) Gomez formed in the heyday of '90s Britpop with an against-the-grain obsession with tight, sharp blues-rock. On its latest album, ''How We Operate'' (ATO), the band has veered into folkier realms, but still plays with unusual precision and focus. Ben Kweller survived his time as a teenage rock prodigy and has carved out a niche as an ambitious singer-songwriter, playing all the instruments on his latest, self-titled album. At 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $28. (Sisario) THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE QUEEN (Monday) The latest solo project by Damon Albarn of Blur and the Gorillaz has a stellar cast: Danger Mouse, the producer who is one-half of Gnarls Barkley; Tony Allen, Fela Kuti's drummer; and Paul Simonon, bassist of the Clash. They might have made a brilliant ruckus together, but their debut album is a strangely pulseless picture of England's wartime malaise. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) * ISIS, JESU (Wednesday) Isis creates a fearsome sludge out of atonal guitars and a permanently distorted bass. As the music heads to repeated climaxes, it can resemble an ecstatic release or the last thrashings of a captured animal. Jesu, led by Justin Broadrick of the British industrial-metal pioneers Godflesh, soars on clouds of rumbling guitar noise that inevitably turn turbulent. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario) KEB' MO' (Thursday) Keb' Mo' (originally Kevin Moore) can sound like an old-time bluesman, with spiky guitar parts and gruff, knowing vocals; lately, he has also been writing songs that offer kindly advice in unassuming pop-folk settings. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $35 and $50. (Pareles) MAN√Å (Wednesday and Thursday) Mexico's most popular rock group, Man√° mingles its Police-derived groove with elements of norte√±o and reggae, and sings about human rights, environmentalism and AIDS. But plenty of the band's songs are about the good old battle of the sexes too: its latest album is ''Amar es Combatir'' (''To Love Is to Fight''). At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $46 to $105.50. (Sisario) MATT AND KIM (Tonight) Meet indie-rock's ultimate birthday band: a Brooklyn couple who pound organ and drums through irrationally exuberant, major-key romps that seem equal parts garage-rock and Nintendo. With Professor Murder and Dynamite Arrows. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) * OF MONTREAL (Tonight and tomorrow night) Of Montreal, which emerged in the '90s with the Elephant Six collective of neo-psychedelic bands in Athens, Ga., plays giddy, harmonically rambling songs by Kevin Barnes, who's clearly a Beach Boys and Beatles fan. With Grand Buffett and Mixel Pixel tonight, and Loney, Dear tomorrow. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. Emil Svanangen, the Swedish songwriter who records moody, pulsating and melodic music as Loney, Dear, also plays on Monday at 8 at Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; sold out. (Pareles) 120 DAYS, SHOUT OUT OUT OUT OUT (Tonight and tomorrow night) These two groups are separated by thousands of miles but are equally obsessed with erotic, electronic dance-rock. 120 Days, from Norway, adds rock 'n' roll thrust and considerable gloom to the perpetual-motion techno of Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder. Shout Out Out Out Out, a six-piece from Edmonton, Alberta, that includes four bassists, grooves along happily and sweatily with bubbling synthesizers and robotic vocals. Tonight at 8:30, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; tomorrow night at 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10. (Sisario) * POGUES (Wednesday and Thursday) The band that made punk look like traditional music -- and vice versa -- plays the first two of three shows for what Guinness now calls the ''St. Patrick's Day season.'' Last year the Pogues made their first appearances in New York in 15 years with Shane MacGowan, their Dionysian, damaged former singer, and Mr. MacGowan is back on board again. With the Holloways on Wednesday, and Langhorne Slim on Thursday. At 8 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $54 in advance, $57 at the door. (Sisario) RAVEONETTES (Tomorrow through Monday) This Danish duo is in love with all the sexy, silly rock of pre-hippie America: motorcycle vamps, Buddy Holly melodies and Sam Cooke chain gangs. It blares through a repertory of lean, minimalist tunes with a noisy nihilism derived from the Velvet Underground and the Jesus and Mary Chain. With the Pity Party. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236, spsounds.com; Sunday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; Monday at 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario) ANOUSHKA SHANKAR (Tonight) Ms. Shankar, the sitarist, 25, who has up to this point been an aesthetic acolyte of her father's (Ravi Shankar's) lithe, neo-traditional take on improvisatory raga, has recently been experimenting with a combination of acoustic and electronic backing instrumentation. At 8, LaGuardia Performing Arts Center, LaGuardia Community College, 47th Avenue at Van Dam Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 482-5151, lagcc.cuny.edu; $30; $15 for students. (Pareles) * SHINS (Wednesday) The Shins emerged from Albuquerque at the turn of the millennium with a sound that slowly but inevitably catapulted them to the upper ranks of the indiesphere: wistful and acoustic, with an adventurousness that sometimes leads to something like psychedelia. (Natalie Portman's exhortation in ''Garden State'' that the band's music will ''change your life'' didn't hurt.) At 8 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $37.50. (Sisario) CHRIS SMITHER (Tonight) With a weary, well-traveled voice and a serenely intricate fingerpicking style, Mr. Smither turns the blues into songs that accept hard-won lessons and try to make peace with fate. ''Love You Like a Man,'' the song Bonnie Raitt borrowed from him in the 1970s, only hints at the thoughtful intensity of his more recent work. At 7, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $22. (Pareles) BOB WEIR AND RATDOG (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Weir, the rhythm guitarist in the Grateful Dead and the kind of musician who lives to be on the road, winds up a three-night stand at the Beacon Theater with his six-piece band Ratdog, playing rock standards and Dead favorites. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171; beacontheatrenyc.com; $39.50 and $49.50. (Sisario) THE WHO (Sunday) Anyone who missed Pete Townshend's impassioned solo renditions of ''The Real Me,'' ''Acid Queen'' and ''Won't Get Fooled Again'' at Joe's Pub a few weeks ago have another chance to hear them in a slightly larger context, the Nassau Coliseum on Long Island.

(Sisario) * AMY WINEHOUSE, PIPETTES (Tuesday) Ms. Winehouse, an R&B singer who in her single ''You Know I'm No Good'' is tough enough to tell Roger Moore she's too high-maintenance for him, is a budding star back home in England and has begun her American campaign.

At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out.

Opera * 'DIE √ÑGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Thursday) Richard Strauss is among the greatest opera composers of the 20th century, yet for a long time the Santa Fe Opera was virtually the only place in the United States that many of his works could be heard. His opera about the most beautiful woman in the world is slow going and hasn't been staged at the Metropolitan Opera since its United States premiere production in 1928. But it's worth hearing for its rich music and, in the Met's new production (by David Fielding) that opens on Thursday, a crack cast, led by Deborah Voigt and Diana Damrau, with Jill Grove in one of opera's more unusual roles, the Omniscient Mussel. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $50 to $550 tickets remaining. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Wednesday) Bartlett Sher's breezy new production of Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' introduced in November, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast. The baritone Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. The tenor Juan Diego Fl√≥rez could not be more adorable as the amorous Count Almaviva, though his voice sounds pinched and shaky at times. Joyce DiDonato, a captivating young mezzo-soprano, takes over the role of Rosina. Maurizio Benini conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Anthony Tommasini) DESSOFF CHOIRS (Tomorrow) ''Musicians Wrestle Everywhere'' is the attention-getting header for a concert of 20th- and 21st-century choral music by this fine choir; it's actually the title of a piece on the program by the increasingly famous Elliott Carter. To the group's credit, it is exploring all kinds of directions off the beaten track: Mr. Carter is the most familiar name on a roster of composers that includes James Bassi, William Duckworth and Phillip Rhodes. The highlight is a world premiere by Kyle Gann, a composer, writer and teacher who is a strong advocate for moving away from well-worn musical paths; ''my father moved through dooms of love'' is the setting of a poem by e. e. cummings. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212) 501-3330; $20 in advance; $25 at the door; $15 for 65+ and students with ID. (Midgette) 'FAUST' (Monday) Gounod's lush score is back at the Met in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before M√©phistoph√©l√®s had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. In the cast: Ram√≥n Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite and Ildar Abdrazakov as M√©phistoph√©l√®s, with Maurizio Benini conducting. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $375 remaining tickets. (Allan Kozinn) 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Sunday and Wednesday) All of the kudos for the Metropolitan Opera's new ''Butterfly'' this season, deserved though they were, seemed rather to overlook the fact that City Opera's elegant, beautiful and abstract ''Butterfly'' partakes of a similar aesthetic, and got there first. There is all the more reason to see the City Opera version, which returns tonight in another installment of the company's popular, $25-a-ticket series, ''Opera for All,'' and sticks around through April 22. Angela Maria Blasi, an established singer in Europe, makes her company debut as Cio-Cio San. Sunday afternoon at 1:30, Wednesday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $125. (Midgette) * 'DIE MEISTERSINGER VON N√úRNBERG (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Otto Schenk's captivating 1993 production of Wagner's humanely comic masterpiece ''Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg is back in the repertory, and the cast is exceptional. The voice of the veteran bass James Morris may be a little patchy these days, but he inhabits the role of Hans Sachs, the wise cobbler and beloved mastersinger, singing with compelling integrity and nobility. The tenor Johan Botha makes a portly Walther, but gives a vocally triumphant account of this demanding role. The fine soprano Hei-Kyung Hong is a lovely and lyrical Eva. And James Levine, in a score he has made a specialty, conducts a nuanced, elegant and stirring performance. (The American conductor John Keenan conducts the final performance on Tuesday night.) Tomorrow at noon, Tuesday at 6 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $72 to $220 tomorrow, $15 to $375 on Tuesday. (Tommasini) 'SIMON BOCCANEGRA' (Tonight) This is the last performance of a revival by the Metropolitan Opera of Verdi's dark melodrama. Angela Marambia takes over as Amelia, and Marcus Haddock as Gabriele. Thomas Hampson and Ferruccio Furlanetto remain. Fabio Luisi is the strong conductor. At 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $15 to $375. (Bernard Holland) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow) For its revival of Verdi's ''Traviata,'' in Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta this season. The earthy Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova, who made her Met debut in 2001 and who was recently heard at the house as Nedda in ''Pagliacci,'' sings Violetta, the role of her debut. The compelling German tenor Jonas Kaufmann sings Alfredo, Violetta's impulsive lover, with the veteran American baritone Dwayne Croft as Alfredo's tragically interfering father, Germont. Marco Armiliato conducts. At 8:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $150 to $375 tickets remaining. (Tommasini) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) The offerings at this intimate, floating chamber music hall this week are from the heart of the standard canon. This weekend it's all Schubert, Schumann and Brahms: tonight and tomorrow Gerald Robbins plays Schubert's Sonata in A, Schumann's Grand Sonata No. 1 in F sharp minor and the Brahms ''Handel'' Variations. On Sunday Mr. Robbins is joined by Glenn Dicterow, the violinist; Karen Dreyfus, the violist; and Frederick Zlotkin, the cellist, for Schubert's Adagio and Rondo Concertante, Schumann's E flat Piano Quartet and Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet.

He will perform Mozart's Sonata in F (K. 533/494); Webern's Variations for Piano (Op. 27); Beethoven's Sonata in C Minor (Op. 13, ''Path√©tique'') and Schumann's ''Kreisleriana'' (Op. 16). Judging by his recent EMI recording, ''Kreisleriana'' should be a particular treat. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $40. (Vivien Schweitzer) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Michael Christie may still be finding his way as music director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, but he seems fully at home with what has long been an adventurous orchestra. His program includes two works by Osvaldo Golijov -- ''Last Round'' and a new orchestration of ''Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind,'' with David Krakauer as the clarinet soloist -- set beside the Mahler First Symphony. Connections? Both Golijov's ''Dreams'' and the Mahler draw on klezmer moves. At 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, brooklynphilharmonic.org. (Tommasini) COUNTER)INDUCTION (Sunday) This innovative new-music ensemble explores contemporary repertory by Japanese composers, including Dai Fujikura's ''Eternal Escape,'' for cello; Jo Kondo's ''Standing,'' for open instrumentation; Misato Mochizuki's ''All that is including me,'' for bass clarinet, violin and bass flute; Toshio Hosokawa's ''Vertical Time Study,'' for cello, piano and clarinet; and Moto Osada's ''Kaguyama Dance,'' for viola and piano.

At 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, Irving Place at 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9. (Holland) * JUAN DIEGO FL√≥REZ, VINCENZO SCALERA (Tomorrow) The young Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Fl√≥rez is enjoying international popularity right now, understandably so. He brings dashing vigor, impressive vocal agility and undeniable charisma to his portrayals of Bel Canto roles. Some critics and buffs worry, though, that a pinched and hard-edged quality is affecting his sound of late. So his long-awaited Carnegie Hall recital should provide a revealing opportunity to hear him simply sing a program of songs by Mozart, Faur√©, Bizet, Rossini and others. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $25 to $95. (Tommasini) LIONHEART (Sunday) This superb vocal sextet specializes in Medieval and Renaissance music.

His recital program includes a handful of Scarlatti Sonatas; Rachmaninoff's Variations on a Theme by Corelli; works by Chopin (long a specialty of Mr. Nakamatsu's) and Liszt; and the New York premiere of Loris Tjeknavorian's ''Danses Fantastiques.''

At 5 p.m., Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 547-0715, frick.org; $25. (Midgette) ORATORIO SOCIETY OF NEW YORK (Tuesday) Kent Tritle is not only one of the best figures on the New York organ and choral music scene, but one of the most dizzyingly active. Named music director of the venerable Oratorio Society in 2006, he leads it this week in an interesting program that juxtaposes Honegger's ''King David'' with Stravinsky's Mass. The soloists are Rachel Rosales, Anna Jablonski, Matthew Garrett and Alexander Hajek, with the 10-year-old treble Andres Felipe Aristizabal as the young David, and Katie Geissinger, a sometime member of Meredith Monk's ensemble, as the Witch of Endor. Jeff Spurgeon, the WQXR announcer, makes his Carnegie Hall debut as the narrator. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $17 to $60. (Midgette) CHRISTIAN POLT√âRA (Tonight) Christian Polt√©ra, a Swiss cellist, and Polina Leschenko, a Russian pianist, present a Distinctive Debut recital, part of the Rising Stars project. The two young musicians will perform Schumann's Fantasiest√ºcke (Op. 73), Prokofiev's Cello Sonata and Rachmaninoff's Sonata for Cello and Piano in G minor (Op. 19). At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28. (Schweitzer) RUSSIAN NATIONAL ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) Vladimir Jurowski conducts a program that will keep these Russian players thinking about home: music by Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev. Leonidas Kavakos is the violin soloist. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $35 to $69. (Holland) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. BRIDGMAN/PACKER DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) This troupe explores the concept of ''video partnering,'' as Art Bridgman and Myrna Packer put it. Their video collaborators are Peter Bobrow, Jim Monroe and Matthias Oostrik. On hand to provide the live music will be Robert Een, Ken Field and Glen Velez. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200, dnadance.org; $25. (Jennifer Dunning) BUGLISI DANCE THEATER (Tuesday through Thursday) A rich repertory includes new works by Jacqulyn Buglisi, among them ''Caravaggio Meets Hopper,'' which juxtaposes images from two painters, one passionate, the other detached in manner; ''Acapelorus (a walrus tale),'' inspired by a New Orleans wall of children's drawings and writings; and ''Atom Hearts Club Suite No. 1,'' which combines several modern-dance techniques. (Through March 18.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $36. (Jack Anderson) 'CHUNK IN 9 PIECES' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The four newish choreographers here -- Rebecca Alaly, Joanna Dee, Shelley Hardin and Ryuji Yamaguchi -- get the week's award for most intriguing program title. Tonight at 9, tomorrow at 7:30, Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (917) 750-2361, chunk9@gmail.com; $10. (Dunning) TINA CROLL AND COMPANY (Thursday) A collage of images and emotions, ''Ancient Springs'' presents such visions as a ritualistic tea party, a karate minuet, a danced dream to Ethiopian jazz and a ceremony in which the Lord's Prayer is recited in Cherokee and Zulu. (Through March 18.) At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $15. (Anderson) DANCE AT DIXON PLACE (Tomorrow and Sunday) In a series called ''Brink,'' work will be presented by Laura Berlin Stinger and Nancy Forshaw-Clapp, chosen by the curator Michael Helland. At 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Houston and Prince Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $12; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning) PHILIPPE DECOUFL√â (Tonight and tomorrow night) This French choreographer is well known for his wonderfully entertaining and often poetic large-scale productions that blend dance, circus, music hall and theater. It's a surprise to find him performing a solo, called ''Solo: Le Doute M'Habite'' (''The Doubt Within Me''), but there are likely to be visual tricks, humor and theatrical magic aplenty. At 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $38; $29 for Joyce members. (Roslyn Sulcas) 'EDWARD SCISSORHANDS' (Wednesday and Thursday) Conceived, directed and choreographed by Matthew Bourne, this re-envisioning of Tim Burton's dark 1990 film of the same title revisits the theme of the outsider, here a gentle boy with scissors for hands. (Through March 31.) Wednesday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m. (Mr. Bourne will discuss the piece in a pre-performance talk on Thursday at 6 p.m.), Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $30 to $80; $8 for discussion. (Dunning) THE 4 TANGO SEASONS (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This show explores nature's cycles as seen through a man and a woman in love. (Through April 1.) Tonight and Thursday night at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718) 729-3880, thaliatheatre.org; $30; $27 for students and 65+; all tickets $25 tonight and Thursday. (Dunning) IRISH MODERN DANCE THEATER (Thursday) The company director, John Scott, describes the repertory of this Dublin-based troupe as a mix of performance art, contact improvisation and mainstream modern-dance techniques. The program includes his own work and dances by the German choreographer Thomas Lehmen and by Chris Yon of New York. (Through March 18.) At 8 p.m., Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * JOFFREY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday) The company, now based in Chicago, makes a rare visit to New York in performances, at two theaters, of Kurt Jooss's ''Green Table,'' George Balanchine's ''Apollo'' and Twyla Tharp's ''Deuce Coupe.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C. W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, N.Y., (516) 299-3100, tillescenter.org; $40 to $75. Sunday at 5 p.m., Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6200; $45. (Dunning) LE VU LONG/TOGETHER HIGHER (Thursday) In ''Stories of Us,'' the Vietnamese choreographer Le Vu Long mingles various dance forms with striking visual designs to comment on gender stereotypes and life-threatening illness. (Through March 17.) At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+. (Anderson) MAYDANCE (Thursday) Juliana F. May's ''Endless House'' ranges in subject matter from the simple life of the amoeba to the complexities of the human experience. (Through March 17.) At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org; $15. (Anderson) MOJITO -- THE LATIN MUSIC SERIES (Tonight and tomorrow night) Latin music is the theme, but the lineup of choreographers and performers, assembled by DancenOw/NYC for its DancemOpolitan series, is stylistically all-encompassing. Featured artists include Donlin Foreman, Max Pollak and a duo known as the Horny Girls. At 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555 for ticket reservations, (212) 539-8778 for table reservations, joespub.com; $20. (Dunning) 92nd STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow, Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The Dusan Tynek Dance Theater performs dances that address decidedly unusual themes created by the troupe's founder, a Czech-born choreographer who has a style that is vivid and quirky in a quietly powerful, folk-art way. His new ''Fleur-de-lis,'' for example, a three-part reimagining of religious paintings and the emotions contained in them, is a dance set to music by the Baroque composer Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber. Zvi Gotheiner's ZviDance closes the festival with his new ''Gertrud,'' inspired by an early mentor, the Israeli dance teacher Gertrud Kraus, and ''Les Noces.'' Tynek tomorrow at 8 p.m., and Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. ZviDance on Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. (Through March 18.) Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500, 92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20. (Dunning) * DESMOND RICHARDSON AND THE ALL STARS PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Richardson and 15 performers from All Stars, a cultural program for teenagers from New York City and Newark, have created ''Homeland Security: Bringing Dr. King Up to Date,'' a multimedia piece that questions American notions of ''homeland'' and ''security.'' (Through April 4.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2 p.m., All Stars Project Theater, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 941-1234, allstars.org; $30 and $35, T.D.F. vouchers accepted. (Dunning) * 651 ARTS: JANT-BI COMPANY (Tomorrow) This lively, enterprising arts center continues its ''Black Dance: Tradition and Transformation'' series with a performance by the JANT-Bi Company of Senegal of ''Fagaala,'' which addresses genocide in choreography by Germaine Acogny and Kota Yamazaki. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4181, Ext. 2229, 651arts.org; $20 to $40. (Dunning) 'SUNDAYS @ THREE': DANIEL CHARON (Sunday) In the latest installment of this informal dance-and-discussion series, Mr. Charon will present works in progress that address how our relationships help us to understand ourselves. At 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, www.92Y.org/dance; $10. (Dunning) * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Thursday) The company offers a little of everything this week. For premieres, there is ''Troilus and Cressida (reduced)'' (tonight, tomorrow afternoon and Wednesday) and ''Lines of Loss (tomorrow). For sexy good fun, keep ''Piazzolla Caldera'' in mind (tonight and Tuesday), with lush beauty to be had in ''Arden Court'' (tomorrow afternoon) and ''Roses'' (Sunday). Then there is the dark Taylor, in ''Banquet of Vultures'' (Tuesday). The facets all come together in ''Company B'' (Sunday), ostensibly a salute to the World War II-era songs sung by the Andrews Sisters but in reality a funny, sexy and heartbreaking look at love and loss that is pure Taylor. (Through March 18.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday at 7 p.m. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, citycenter.org; $15 to $125. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: MART√çN RAM√çREZ, through April 29. Ram√≠rez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters (most notably, a mounted caballero and a levitating Madonna crowned like the Statue of Liberty.) But most of all, Ram√≠rez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) * ASIA SOCIETY: GLASS, GILDING, AND GRAND DESIGN: ART OF SASANIAN IRAN (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org.(Holland Cotter) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He's best known for his views of aristocratic race horses, but he painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'FAMILY PICTURES,' through April 16. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON'S SCRAPBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHS, 1932-46,' through April 29. Arrived by way of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris, this show has more than 300 of the prints the photographer glued into an album and toted to New York for curators at the Museum of Modern Art to cull. Captured by the Nazis, he had been presumed dead when the Modern planned his retrospective. Then he turned up alive -- the ''posthumous'' exhibition opened, with him in attendance, in 1947. The current exhibition reconstructs as best as possible the layout of the scrapbook. It surveys the revolutionary work he shot in Spain, Italy, Mexico, Britain and France. His taste for uncanny detail linked him to Surrealism and Surrealist wit, but unlike many Surrealists, he remained committed to human values. Boys mug at his camera. Prostitutes swan. Their gazes equalize them with us. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman) INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'MARTIN MUNKACSI: THINK WHILE YOU SHOOT!' through April 29. Munkacsi, who inspired Cartier-Bresson, was, by contrast, self-taught, a creature of his own devising. This is the most complete retrospective, with a thick catalog (not too well researched) and dozens of vintage prints from the 1920s through the early '60s. He favored scenes of daily life, absorbing avant-garde ideas about odd angles and abstract compositions. In 1928 he moved to Berlin and traveled the world on assignment to Brazil, Algeria and Egypt. Munkacsi was a stylist, and he made catchy images the only way he knew how, in a modernist mode, which, being an opportunistic form, could serve any master. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTISTIC COLLABORATIONS: 50 YEARS OF UNIVERSAL LIMITED ART EDITIONS,' through May 21. This exhibition marks the half-century milestone for Universal Limited Art Editions in West Islip, N.Y., and its association with the Museum of Modern Art: The museum has acquired one print from every edition made at Universal, more than 1,200 works by nearly 50 artists. Prints by 12 artists are in this show. Among them are lithographs by Jasper Johns, with his signature maps and flags. Robert Rauschenberg is represented primarily by lithographs from the 1960s that combine found images of figures like John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson with the freehand scrawling associated with Abstract Expressionism. It's hard to fault an exhibition that features prints by masters like Mr. Johns and Mr. Rauschenberg. But given the somewhat precarious position of prints in the contemporary art world, the inclusion of younger artists would make a good argument that traditional printmaking is still relevant and holds possibilities for this generation. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Schwendener) MOMA: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Including 30 works by 13 artists from the last 16 years, it alternates between the literal and the arbitrary and favors sincere political intent over genuine artistic quality. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (See above.) (Smith) * MOMA: 'JEFF WALL,' through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith) WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GORDON MATTA-CLARK RETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. He came up with various wonderfully harebrained ideas. Literally, in one case: after letting his hair grow for a year, he cut it off as a kind of performance and phrenological gag. The preserved hair, dutifully tagged piece by piece, opens the show like a holy relic. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Kimmelman) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LORNA SIMPSON,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea * 'WHAT F WORD?' The ''F word'' in question in this group is feminism, though others come under its purview. The work spans decades, from an apt updating of a Flemish madonna and child by the estimable and too-long-overlooked Anita Steckel, to very recent art by Dana Frankfort, Jane Hammond and Shay Nowick. In a brand-new piece, Elaine Reichek brings Ezra Pound into the picture; Ulrike Muller pays tribute to Mina Loy. Patricia Cronin contributes an image of a tomb sculpture she designed, depicting herself and her lover, the artist Deborah Kass (also in the show) embracing on a bed. The sculpture is installed on a plot the two women own in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, where it is intended to remain forever. Cynthia Broan Gallery, 546 West 29th Street, (212) 760-0809, cynthiabroan.com; through March 17. (Cotter) Last Chance GILLIAN CARNEGIE In this British painter's second New York gallery show, surface brittleness and Conceptual dallying have decreased, which is good. Her subjects include landscape, still life, her own behind; Mondrian, monochromes and English painting are evoked. If less self-consciousness would be welcome, there is still enough to look at. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * JOE FYFE: PAINTINGS 2004-2007 Made with acrylic, crayon and sundry appliqu√©d fabrics on rough-grained burlap, these weirdly tactile, quietly opulent paintings evoke the history of Modernist painting with wit and homey craft. Motifs familiar from the art of Barnett Newman, Paul Feeley and Robert Motherwell, as well as more generic riffs, seem weirdly magnified, even brutal. The sharper palette of Color Field and the formal reticence of Minimalism are deployed. Like the more fashionable painter Sergei Jensen, Mr. Fyfe makes the argument that there is more than one way to be pictorial, but with greater deliberation and visual rewards. The problem is that beyond their engaging physicality and intelligence, these works often stay too close to their sources, which makes them feel cautious. J G Contemporary, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767, jamesgrahamandsons.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * ROBERT MANGOLD: COLUMN STRUCTURE PAINTINGS A beautiful (sky-lighted) show from one of painting's most dedicated Minimalists, this group of 12 tall canvases continues his basic vocabulary of shaped canvases, monochromatic palette and spare lines (both ruled and freehand). They take the measure of themselves in ways that seem utterly simple and transparent. Yet they hover tantalizingly between puzzles and mysteries. Pace Wildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, Chelsea, pacewildenstein.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) BOYD RICE Musician, writer, artist and all-purpose prankster, Boyd Rice was a big deal in the 1970s in Los Angeles, where he recorded industrial noise music under the name Non and produced all-black Color Field paintings. The abstract paintings in his first New York solo show, made from sprayed enamel and rust, feel somewhat demure, considering their live-wire source, though their looping, wavelike forms do suggest turbulence. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 511 West 25th Street, second floor, Chelsea, (212) 242-6242; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * RICHARD STANKIEWICZ If you don't know the junk sculpture of Richard Stankiewicz (1922-1983), are puzzled by his staunch if insufficient reputation or just want a visual thrill, see this show of four excellent pieces from the 1950s and early '60s, standing sentinel-like in the gallery. They are resplendent in their evocations of the industrial, the tribal, the figurative and the abstract. Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223, zabriskiegallery.com; closes tomorrow.

      "lead_paragraph": "AMERICANS who read the papers or watch Jay Leno have been aware for some time now that there is a slim but real possibility -- about 1 in 45,000 -- that an 850-foot-long asteroid called Apophis could strike Earth with catastrophic consequences on April 13, 2036. What few probably realize is that there are thousands of other space objects that could hit us in the next century that could cause severe damage, if not total destruction. Last week two events in Washington -- a conference on ''planetary defense'' held by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the release by NASA of a report titled ''Near-Earth Object Survey and Deflection Analysis of Alternatives'' -- gave us good news and bad on this front. On the promising side, scientists have a good grasp of the risks of a cosmic fender-bender, and have several ideas that could potentially stave off disaster. Unfortunately, the government doesn't seem to have any clear plan to put this expertise into action."

Vanessa Redgrave stars in this adaptation of Joan Didion's heartbreaking memoir. David Hare directs (1:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA' Lincoln Center Theater's brave, gorgeous, sprawling and ultimately exhilarating production of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about intellectuals errant in 19th-century Russia. A testament to the seductive powers of narrative theater, directed with hot and cool canniness by Jack O'Brien and featuring a starry cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Jennifer Ehle, Martha Plimpton, Josh Hamilton and Ethan Hawke, among others) in a tasty assortment of roles. Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Ra√∫l Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called Little Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson (as her bedridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HOWARD KATZ' The subject of Patrick Marber's comedy of unhappiness about a rabid talent agent, starring a baleful Alfred Molina and directed by Doug Hughes, is nothing more nor less than your standard-issue midlife crisis. This familiar topic gets the better of all the talented people here trying to make it seem fresh (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) * 'JOURNEY'S END' A splendid revival of R. C. Sherriff's 1928 drama of life in the trenches during World War I. Acutely staged (by David Grindley) and acted by a fine ensemble led by Hugh Dancy and Boyd Gaines, this production offers an exemplary presentation of that theatrical rarity, an uncompromising, clear-eyed play about war and the experience of day-to-day combat. An essential ticket (2:40). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'LES MIS√âRABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'PRELUDE TO A KISS' Craig Lucas's broken-hearted romantic comedy from 1990 receives a first-rate remounting, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company. Alan Tudyk and Annie Parisse play a young couple whose marriage founders shortly after the bride receives a kiss from an elderly stranger (John Mahoney). The kiss awakens all three to an unsettling awareness of love's frailty and, paradoxically, of its durability too (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Charles Isherwood) * 'SPRING AWAKENING' Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest and most exciting new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered emotional lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'TALK RADIO' The most lacerating portrait of a human meltdown this side of a Francis Bacon painting. Playing an abrasive radio talk show host with a God complex, the astounding Liev Schreiber seems to fill the air as inescapably as weather in Robert Falls's gut-grabbing revival of Eric Bogosian's 1987 play (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) * 'TRANSLATIONS' The estimable Irish director Garry Hynes (a Tony winner for Martin McDonagh's ''Beauty Queen of Leenane'') has assembled an ensemble of an extraordinarily high caliber and consistency for the third major New York production of Brian Friel's 1980 play. Set in Ireland in 1833, as the local tongue is being supplanted by the language of the English occupying forces, the play explores the seriocomic truth that language can divide as easily as it unites, and can never hope to translate the rich music in our souls with the delicacy we yearn for. A top-flight Broadway revival (2:15). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'THE ATTIC' The playwright Yoji Sakate looks at hikikomori, the Japanese phenomenon in which teenagers retreat from society, isolating themselves for weeks, months and sometimes even years. With a deft ensemble cast, the results are illuminating, original and darkly funny. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Ginia Bellafante) 'BILL W. AND DR. BOB' This insightful new play about the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous subtly makes the claim that the recovery movement was born as a series of accidents. Patrick Husted is excellent as Bob Smith, Bill Wilson's partner in combatting addictions (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Bellafante) 'BLINDNESS' Joe Tantalo's adaptation of Jos√© Saramago's best-selling novel, about an unnamed city struck with an inexplicable epidemic of ''white blindness,'' is set in a cell-like space surrounded by white scrim. This setting and the mostly strong acting drive home the fearful basic circumstances. Unfortunately, the script also streamlines Mr. Saramago's reflective story to the point of draining it of moral complexity (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE CAVE DWELLERS' This revival of William Saroyan's 1957 play about a group of misfits inhabiting an abandoned theater examines the virtue of charity and the nobility of failure but feels as stifling and constricted as the building in which the outcasts find themselves. A production that asks us to revere the theater without inviting reverence itself (1:30). Pearl Theater, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Bellafante) 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH' This grim tale by Stuart Carolan of low-level I.R.A. agitators trying to identify the informer in their midst features some visceral performances and a set by Charles Corcoran that makes excellent use of the Irish Rep's small stage. If only the cause itself didn't feel so small in these days of global terrorism (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Neil Genzlinger) 'THE DIRECTOR' A likable if na√Øve young woman, who is seduced by an unnamed, unseen and presumably unscrupulous film director, seeks other of his victims and tape records their experiences for no clear purpose in a play that has no clear idea of what it wants to say (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) * 'DYING CITY' Christopher Shinn's crafty and unsettling play about grief and violence, set in the shadow of the Iraq war. Directed by James Macdonald and fiercely acted by Pablo Schreiber and Rebecca Brooksher, this quiet, transfixing production turns passive aggression into a theatrical dynamic. (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-7600. (Brantley) 'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) * 'IN THE HEIGHTS' Lin-Manuel Miranda's joyous songs paint a vibrant portrait of daily life in Washington Heights in this flawed but enjoyable show. Essentially a valentine to the barrio -- conflict of a violent or desperate kind is banished from the picture -- the musical contains a host of vibrant, funny performances and brings the zesty sound of Latin pop to the stage. (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 'A JEW GROWS IN BROOKLYN' You don't have to be Jewish or Brooklynish to empathize with Jake Ehrenreich, but in terms of fully appreciating his essentially one-man show, it probably helps. Especially the Catskills jokes (2:05). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 560-8912. (Anita Gates) * 'KING HEDLEY II' The Signature Theater Company concludes its season dedicated to August Wilson with a gritty, strongly cast revival of this play set in a violence-ravaged Pittsburgh in the 1980s. Russell Hornsby gives a galvanizing performance in the title role, as a man struggling to live down the errors of his past and plant the seeds for a promising new life (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Isherwood) 'KING LEAR' Or ''Lear Lite,'' featuring New Age music; eye-soothing, color-coordinated costumes; and the charming Kevin Kline in the title role. Directed by James Lapine, this is a whimsical story-book production that feels perversely out of touch with the soul-wrenching depths of Shakespeare's most devastating tragedy (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Brantley) 'LOS ANGELES' Julian Sheppard's play about a gamin lost in a Hollywood of aimlessness and empty sex is as thin as the slip dress she keeps wearing and, presumably, taking off (1:20). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Bellafante) 'MARY ROSE' J. M. Barrie wrote this distaff variation on themes from ''Peter Pan'' in 1920, and it has mostly lain on the shelf since. A young English girl (an exuberant Paige Howard) acquires the odd habit of disappearing and reappearing some time later, untouched by time's passing. Gentle and melancholy, handsomely mounted by Tina Landau, ''Mary Rose'' is nonetheless itself touched by the mark of time (1:45). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood) 'MY MOTHER'S ITALIAN, MY FATHER'S JEWISH AND I'M IN THERAPY' Steve Solomon does skillful impersonations in his one-man show, but some of his jokes are as old as the hills (1:30). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) 'MY TRIP TO AL-QAEDA' Lawrence Wright, author of a deeply researched book about the rise of Islamic terrorism, conducts a theatrical seminar about the events leading to the horror of 9/11. He combines a linear narrative of the development of Al Qaeda with reminiscences about the experience of writing the book. Absorbing, and chilling too (1:30). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) * 'SPALDING GRAY: STORIES LEFT TO TELL' A disarming collage of selections from the monologues and journals of Mr. Gray, the ultimate stand-up solipsist, who died in 2004. Directed by Lucy Sexton, and read by five performers, none of whom resemble Mr. Gray, with an affection that shrewdly stops short of hero worship (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'THE VOYSEY INHERITANCE' David Mamet has cleanly and cannily adapted Harley Granville Barker's 1905 play about corruption in the genteel world of Victorian finance. An excellent cast and a sumptuous production bring extra immediacy to a tale of embezzlement and entitlement that feels as fresh as tomorrow's stock options (1:50). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'WAKE UP MR. SLEEPY! YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS DEAD!' Richard Foreman's latest film-theater hybrid is a memorial service, of sorts, for the intuitive self, killed by a surface-worshiping world. It is also a dazzling exercise in reality shifting that is as invigorating as it is mournful (1:05). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AT LEAST IT'S PINK' Bridget Everett and her big, bad attitude co-star in this mini-musical about sex and unsatisfying jobs in the city. Directed by Michael Patrick King (of ''Sex and the City,'' as it happens), who is also the co-author, and with songs written by Ms. Everett and Kenny Mellman, the piano-playing half of Kiki & Herb. Raucous and rude, it's a bit like a one-woman episode of ''Jerry Springer'' (1:20). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) 'BAAL' The director Charmian Creagle's bright idea for staging Bertolt Brecht's often offensive first play -- about a poet and singer who is a monster of appetite -- was to cast the title role as a woman. The production is so poorly acted and drearily directed, however, that the casting does nothing to illuminate the play or open a meaningful inquiry into habitual reactions to it (2:15). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 307-9467. (Kalb) 'MOBY DICK -- REHEARSED' A gripping revival of Orson Welles's 1955 adaptation of Melville's classic (2:00). Richmond Shepard Theater, 309 East 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'PARTICULARLY IN THE HEARTLAND' You can almost feel the self-congratulation in the hearts and minds of the writers and performers of this surrealist ensemble piece as they try to understand how the Red states think and live. The result? A well-intentioned mess of emoting over the current political divides (1:30). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101). (Bellafante) 'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny (1:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates) Long-Running Shows 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' Singing CliffsNotes for Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Often more entertaining than the real thing (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway?

Robert Cucuzza's period piece about swindlers, liars and prostitutes is surprisingly sedate (1:30). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, www.acmeactinglab.com; closes tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'REPUBLIC OF DREAMS' A homage to Bruno Schulz that consists of a pastiche of scenes suggested by excerpts from that profoundly surreal Polish writer's work. Parts are intriguing, but there is little coherence in the jumble of scenes to help an audience unfamiliar with the author (1:00). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; closes on Sunday. (Hampton) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday.

(Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'THE ABANDONED' (R, 95 minutes) The title of this dull, hysterical horror movie seems to refer to its release strategy. The greatest mystery is why it showed up in theaters at all, rather than going straight to DVD. (A. O. Scott) 'AMAZING GRACE' (PG, 120 minutes) Michael Apted's prettified take on the life and times of the 18th-century reformer William Wilberforce carries a strong whiff of piety but is generally pleasing and often moving, and features fine performances from newcomers and veterans alike. (Manohla Dargis) 'THE ASTRONAUT FARMER' (PG, 102 minutes) This sentimental fable about a Texas rancher who follows his dreams and builds a rocket ship in his barn is made bearable -- just -- by Billy Bob Thornton's underplayed performance in the lead role, and also by the wide-eyed visual wonderment of the director, Michael Polish, who is the co-writer of the picture with his twin brother, Mark. (Scott) 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN' (R, 116 minutes) Christina Ricci as a Tennessee nymphomaniac and Samuel Jackson as the blues singer who tries to cure her by fastening her half-naked self to his radiator with a chain. In spite of that summary, it's mostly corny uplift, from Craig Brewer, who also wrote and directed the down-home pimp fairy tale ''Hustle & Flow.'' (Scott) 'BREACH' (PG-13, 110 minutes) In his fine, no-nonsense account of the capture of the F.B.I. agent-turned-mole Robert Philip Hanssen, the director Billy Ray manages to excite and unnerve despite our knowing the ending. Chris Cooper and Ryan Phillippe star. (Dargis) * 'BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA' (PG, 95 minutes) Grounded more in reality than in fantasy, this adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel offers an affecting story of a transformative friendship between two gifted children. Beautifully capturing a time when a bully in school can loom as large as a troll in a nightmare, the director, Gabor Csupo, keeps the fantasy in the background to find magic in the everyday. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'A JOURNEY OF DMITRY SHOSTAKOVICH' (No rating, 75 minutes) A documentary grab bag of film clips, diary readings and desultory narration, ''A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich'' peeks at the politics of this controversial composer through a flurry of archival curiosities. But in their struggle to portray a man compromising his art to save his life, the directors, Oksana Dvornichenko and Helga Landauer, adopt a scattershot approach that's ultimately as ambiguous and impenetrable as its subject. (Catsoulis) * 'THE CATS OF MIRIKITANI' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Japanese) Linda Hattendorf's remarkable documentary follows her growing friendship with a homeless artist from her New York City neighborhood. Born in Sacramento in 1920 and raised in Hiroshima, Jimmy Tsutomu Mirikitani relives his painful past with vivid paintings of internment camps and blood-red cities. When his health is threatened by the dust clouds of Sept. 11, Ms. Hattendorf moves him into her home, and what began as an interesting portrait of an outsider artist becomes a fascinating story of injustice and endurance. (Catsoulis) * 'THE DEPARTED' (R, 150 minutes) Martin Scorsese's cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves is at once a success and a relief. Based on the crackling Hong Kong thriller ''Infernal Affairs,'' it features fine twinned performances from Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, and a showboating Jack Nicholson. (Dargis) 'DREAMGIRLS' (PG-13, 131 minutes) The Broadway musical arrives on the screen, capably directed by Bill Condon, ardently acted and sung by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonc√© Knowles and (especially) Jennifer Hudson, but undone by mediocre and anachronistic songs. (Scott) 'EXTERMINATING ANGELS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in French) The French director Jean-Claude Brisseau's film is a piece of highbrow smut about a French filmmaker directing a piece of highbrow smut. A must for fans of highbrow smut. No complaints here. (Scott) 'GHOST RIDER' (PG-13, 114 minutes) After a long string of financial flops, Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, a stunt motorcycle rider whose soul belongs to the Devil. Despite the promise of the first 30 minutes -- when Johnny is played by the charming young actor Matt Long -- a witless script and a central character who's more funny than frightening suggest that the filmmakers' franchise hopes may be dashed. (Catsoulis) 'HANNIBAL RISING' (R, 121 minutes) This primer on Hannibal Lecter reduces a mythic villain to a callow, dysfunctional chef. Orphaned in World War II, our psychopathic hero hunts down his family's killers and snacks on their remains. But burrowing into the id of pop culture's most repulsive gourmet demands a sanguinary glee that the director, Peter Webber, may not possess; for all the movie's spurting gore, there's no rush of blood to the head. (Catsoulis) * 'THE HOST' (R, 119 minutes, in Korean) A loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid -- part carnival of horrors, part family melodrama -- about the demons that haunt us from without and within. The talented South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho directs his monster and humans with equal flair. (Dargis) * 'INTO GREAT SILENCE' (No rating, 162 minutes, in English and Latin) Philip Gr√∂ning's documentary about the lives of Carthusian monks living in a valley in the French Alps is slow, quiet and utterly spellbinding for the way it conveys the experience of spiritual devotion in simple, lovely images. (Scott) 'THE LAST KING OF SCOTLAND' (R, 121 minutes) Kevin Macdonald paints a queasily enjoyable portrait of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin from inside the palace walls. Forest Whitaker plays the mad king, while James McAvoy plays the fool. (Dargis) * 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' (R, 141 minutes, in Japanese) Another masterwork from Clint Eastwood's astonishing late period, and one of the best war movies ever. Ken Watanabe is especially fine as the general commanding Japanese troops in the doomed defense of the island of Iwo Jima. (Scott) * 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS' (R, 137 minutes, in German) Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut feature takes place in East Berlin in 1984, and it is a smart, moving inquiry into the moral predicament facing good people in a bad system. Ulrich M√ºhe's performance as a conscience-stricken Stasi officer is a tightly wound tour de force, and Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are both superb as a playwright and his actress lover who are drawn into the cruel, absurd clutches of the Communist secret police. (Scott) 'MAXED OUT' (No rating, 87 minutes) A scattershot expos√© of usurious banking practices in debt-ridden America, ''Maxed Out'' examines why the most vulnerable segment of society is victimized by the lending industry and finds a simple answer: it's obscenely profitable. (Stephen Holden) 'MUSIC AND LYRICS' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant phone in passable impersonations of themselves in this competent romantic comedy, which is somewhat enlivened by parodies of bad pop songs from both the 1980s and the present. (Scott) 'THE NAMESAKE' (PG-13, 122 minutes) Color is the stuff of life in the movies of Mira Nair, the Indian-born director whose newest film, adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri's popular novel, follows two generations of a Bengali family from late-1970s Calcutta to New York City. Her lush palette lends her films a throbbing physicality that invites you to step into the screen and embrace the sensuous here and now. (Holden) 'THE NUMBER 23' (R, 95 minutes) An accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). (Dargis) * 'PAN'S LABYRINTH' (R, 119 minutes, in Spanish) Guillermo del Toro's tale of a young girl's ordeal in post-Civil-War fascist Spain is either a fairy tale in the guise of a political allegory or vice versa. In either case it is a moving, enchanting, strange and humane example of popular art at its very best. (Scott) * 'THE QUEEN' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Directed by Stephen Frears from a very smart script by Peter Morgan, and starring a magnificent Helen Mirren in the title role, ''The Queen'' pries open a window in the House of Windsor around the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, blending fact with fiction. (Dargis) 'RENO 911!: MIAMI' (R, 81 minutes) The title more or less says all you need to know about the story, the action and the point. (Dargis) 'ROCK BOTTOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) This graphic documentary by Jay Corcoran is a strong, scary examination of the crystal methedrine epidemic among gay men in New York. (Holden) 'STARTER FOR TEN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) This amiable, nostalgic British comedy tackles a lofty subject -- the allure of knowledge --with down-to-earth charm, following a working-class kid (James McAvoy) during his first year at Bristol University and an appearance on the TV quiz show ''University Challenge.'' But beneath the formulaic embarrassments and fumbled learning curve lurks a more somber theme: the inevitable rupture between those who pursue an education and those left behind. (Catsoulis) '300' (R, 116 minutes) Greeks versus Persians in the big rumble at Thermopylae, via Frank Miller's graphic novel. As dumb as they get. (Scott) 'THE ULTIMATE GIFT' (PG, 114 minutes) This hairball of good-for-you filmmaking coughed up by 20th Century Fox's new religion-oriented label, Fox Faith, follows a trust fund baby (Drew Fuller) as he learns to be a better, poorer person. And while it's always fun when Hollywood aims to instruct us in the spiritual pitfalls of filthy lucre, perhaps insulting the artistic sensibilities of Christian audiences isn't the best way to get them into the multiplex. (Catsoulis) 'WILD HOGS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Tame slop. (Scott) * 'ZODIAC' (R, 158 minutes) David Fincher's magnificently obsessive new film tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the '70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, ''Zodiac'' is part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is a testament to this cinematic savant's gifts. (Dargis) Film Series 'CENTERED IN THE STORM': WORKS BY MASTER FILMMAKER TIAN ZHUANGZHUANG (Today through Tuesday) The main attraction of this mini-retrospective of one of China's most eclectic and interesting filmmakers is ''The Go Master,'' Mr. Tian's most recent film and the story of a young Chinese man who rises through the ranks of Japan's championship Go players while World War II rages offscreen. Also screening: ''The Blue Kite,'' a 1993 feature about a family torn apart by the excesses of Maoism (it earned Mr. Tian a five-year ban from feature filmmaking), and the serenely classical ''Springtime in a Small Town'' (2002), this director's illuminating remake of a 1948 Chinese feature by Fei Mu. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $10. (Dave Kehr) 'PIMPS, PROSTITUTES AND PIGS': SHOHEI IMAMURA'S JAPAN (Today through Thursday) The great earthy cynic of Japanese film, Shohei Imamura, died last year, leaving a staggering volume of work. This monthlong festival includes several of his more rarely screened films, including (tonight) ''Profound Desire of the Gods'' (1968), a raucous social panorama set on a small island where technology is destroying the old way of life; ''The Pornographers'' (1966), an unlikely comedy about a man who makes pornographic movies in the hope of improving the Japanese character; and ''Intentions of Murder'' (1964)), in which a woman defies convention and takes matters into her own hands after she is raped. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $10. (Kehr) 'LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION': ARTISTS' FILMS FOR THE CINEMA (Tomorrow) The Whitney Museum of American Art's series of films by artists best known for their work in other mediums continues with a program enigmatically called ''Hype My Light.'' Tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. Joseph Cornell's collage film ''Rose Hobart'' (1936), about that all but forgotten actress, will be shown. This 19-minute reverie was carved out of a 16-millimeter print of the 1931 Universal sound feature ''East of Borneo'' (and not from ''a classic silent,'' as the Whitney catalog asserts). It shares a double bill with the self-mythologizing of ''Pull My Daisy'' (1959), Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie's celebration of their Beat Generation pals. At 2 p.m. Buster Keaton walks through Samuel Beckett's ''Film'' (1965) (which the Whitney, paradoxically, is screening on video). It will be followed by Rebecca Horn's 1991 feature, ''Buster's Bedroom,'' about a woman so obsessed with Keaton that she checks herself into the sanitarium where he dried out in the 1930s. Whitney Museum of American Art, (212) 570-3676, whitney.org; $15. (Kehr) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. * ALLMAN BROTHERS (Thursday) The best spring ritual on the Upper West Side is the arrival of this archetypal Southern rock band for its annual series of concerts at the Beacon Theater. This year there are 13 shows over three weeks, beginning on Thursday, and in addition to the long, long guitar solos by Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, highlights usually include lots of guest stars. At 8 p.m., 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Ben Sisario) LAURIE ANDERSON (Tonight and Sunday night) Ms. Anderson's entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and reflective monologues with a witty, seamless dream logic. At 7, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario) Diahann Carroll (Tonight and tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday nights) Her follow-up to last year's triumphant return to nightclub performance is essentially the same show she performed last year, but with a few tweaks. It's still excellent. At 8:30, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $75 cover, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden) KARAN CASEY (Monday) A former member of the Irish band Solas, Ms. Casey sets her clear voice in arrangements that mix traditional and modern instruments, maintaining the taut, quivering ornamentation of old ballad style and singing tales of love, war and murder with a gentle gravity. At 7:30 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000, makor.org; $20. (Jon Pareles) CHIEFTAINS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Chieftains spearheaded a revival of Irish traditional music, playing only the oldest instruments: fiddle, harp, wooden flute, uilleann pipes, bodhran, tin whistle. Then they decided that Irish tradition wasn't enough and started to look further afield: to Spain, to China, to rock. But they have been returning to their Irish core, and there's a great ensemble behind the shtick. Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $22 to $68. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $30 to $85. (Pareles) DAUGHTRY (Monday) Like Jennifer Hudson, Chris Daughtry -- who drops his first name when performing with a band -- is a sign of why ''American Idol'' doesn't work perfectly: he reached only as high as No. 4 last season, but his album, ''Daughtry'' (RCA), with arena-size, fist-pumping rock songs, has become one of the biggest and steadiest sellers of the year. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario) DECEMBERISTS (Wednesday and Thursday) He might not exactly have a lot of competition, but Colin Meloy, the songwriter and strategist of this band from Portland, Ore., can set old Irish epics and alliterative fables about Dickensian chimney sweeps to progressive folk-rock like nobody else. Opening the show is My Brightest Diamond, led by Shara Worden, who in a slippery and dexterous voice spins fantasies that leap in scale from music boxes to heavenly bodies. At 8 p.m., Landmark Loew's Jersey Theater, 54 Journal Square, Jersey City, (866) 468-7619, loewsjersey.org; $27.50 to $30. (Sisario) THE DOUBLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Something is always intriguingly askew in the songs of this local band: jagged guitars, David Greenhill's neurotic sing-speak vocals, the asymmetric gurglings of its Vox Continental organ. But the oblique lines come together in unexpected and sometimes hauntingly beautiful ways. With Mike Wexler tonight, and the Japanese Beetles and Crystal Stilts tomorrow. At 8, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $8. (Sisario) EXPLOSIONS IN THE SKY (Tuesday) The epic instrumentals by this band from Austin, Tex., begin in peace, with single notes twinkling amid darkness, and gradually build to turbulent vortexes of noise. Borrowing a few tricks from Pink Floyd, Explosions in the Sky keeps the pace majestic and the vistas cinematic, and takes its time. With the Paper Chase and Eluvium. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; sold out. (Sisario) RUTHIE FOSTER (Wednesday and Thursday) A veteran of the acoustic folk circuit, this Texas singer and guitarist has turned to the sound of cozy 1960s soul on her new album, ''The Phenomenal Ruthie Foster'' (Blue Corn Music). That suits her friendly alto fine, but her power and sass come through better in bare, bluesy songs, like her version of Son House's boiling ''Grinnin' in Your Face.'' Wednesday at 8 p.m., with Amy Helm of Ollabelle, at the Tap Bar at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. Thursday at 10 p.m., with Lucy Wainwright Roche, at Pete's Candy Store, 709 Lorimer Street, between Frost and Richardson Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-3770, petescandystore.com; free. (Sisario) Fujiya & Miyagi (Sunday through Tuesday) This British trio, which derives part of its name from ''The Karate Kid'' -- ''We are only pretending to be Japanese,'' goes one lyric -- plays bubbly, perpetual-motion figures of guitar and keyboard, and never breaks a sweat. Its sound has been heard plenty of times before, from '90s groups like Stereolab and from earlier German experimentalists, but it's too fun and innocuous to ever tire of. Sunday at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; sold out. Monday at 9 p.m., McIntosh Student Center, Barnard College, Broadway at 117th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-6538, wbar.org; $5. (Sisario) * GILBERTO GIL (Tuesday) This pillar of Brazilian music, a creator of the postmodern Tropic√°lia style in the '60s and now his country's minister of culture, makes a rare appearance at Carnegie Hall. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $72. (Sisario) * LEVON HELM (Tonight and tomorrow night) After a hiatus for recovery from throat cancer, Mr. Helm, the former drummer of the Band and the singer of hits like ''The Weight,'' has returned with a raspier but still powerfully expressive voice. These shows have an unusual setting: the Beacon Theater. Lately Mr. Helm has preferred to play for small groups at his home studio in Woodstock, N.Y. At 8 p.m., 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 307-7171, beacontheatrenyc.com; sold out. (Sisario) INDIGO GIRLS (Tuesday and Wednesday) Guitar strumming, close harmonies, coffeehouse earnestness and songs about the perpetual struggle for love, self-affirmation and a clear conscience have made the duo of Emily Saliers and Amy Ray perennials for the collegiate at heart. With Kaki King. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $40. (Pareles) KODO (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Japanese drum troupe doesn't need microphones for some of its music: taiko ritual pieces made to be heard for miles, pounded on drums as large as the people who play them. From that foundation, the group has also fused its music with rhythms from India, Brazil and elsewhere. Tonight, as part of its 25th-anniversary tour, Kodo members play a rare small-scale show at Joe's Pub with Kaoru Watanabe, a former member now based in New York. At 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $35; $60 for both shows. Tomorrow night at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $20 to $58. (Pareles) * LAMB OF GOD (Thursday) Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and without any irony or sarcasm calls its style ''pure American metal.'' With Trivium, Machine Gun and Gojira. At 6:45 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; $26 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario) SUSAN McKEOWN (Today) A regular on the Irish music scene of New York, Ms. McKeown, who was born in Dublin, performs traditional music and contemporary songs about the immigrant experience in a strong, forthright voice. At 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505, worldfinancialcenter.com; free. (Sisario) MEW (Thursday) This Danish band straddles the arty and sentimental extremes of Radiohead, indulging in dense guitar textures but leaving room for crying, emotive vocals. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sisario) Jane Monheit (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The beauty of her sultry voice performing bossa nova ballads triumphs over liabilities that include obvious shyness and rushed, perfunctory patter. At 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight, tomorrow and Thursday, Caf√© Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $75 cover at tables, $55 at the bar. (Holden) * WILLIE NELSON, MERLE HAGGARD AND RAY PRICE (Thursday) On their new album, ''The Last of the Breed'' (Lost Highway), these mellow titans of country music lean back and savor every sweet note of classic songs by Hank Williams, Kris Kristofferson and others, recreating with pedal steel guitars and harmonies by the Jordanaires the sound of a Nashville recording studio, about 1960. At 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171, radiocity.com; $46.50 to $81.50. (Sisario) * OOIOO (Tuesday) O.K., maybe this offshoot of the Japanese band the Boredoms is not quite as cartoonishly antic as that group, which for nearly two decades has been one of the planet's most unpredictable musical forces. But the tribal drums, electronic squeaks and jazz-fusion guitar and trumpet on OOIOO's new album, ''Taiga'' (Thrill Jockey), come pretty close. Also on the bill is I.U.D., featuring Lizzie Bougatsos of the experimental New York band Gang Gang Dance. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132, knittingfactory.com; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sisario) * POGUES (Tomorrow) The band that made traditional Irish music seem like punk rock -- and vice versa -- plays the last of three shows for what Guinness calls the ''St. Patrick's Day season.'' Last year the Pogues played their first shows in New York in 15 years with Shane MacGowan, their Dionysian former singer, and Mr. MacGowan is back on board again. With the Tossers. At 8 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, roselandballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario) RODRIGO Y GABRIELA (Wednesday) Once thrash-metal bandmates in Mexico, this guitar duo discovered what the Gipsy Kings have long known: Europeans and Americans go crazy for virtuosic acoustic renditions of their favorite '70s rock ballads. The Gipsy Kings did it with ''Hotel California,'' and Rodrigo y Gabriela's repertory includes a lush ''Stairway to Heaven.'' With Krystle Warren. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario) RALPH STANLEY (Sunday) Mr. Stanley's stark, unflinching ''O Death'' leaped out of the soundtrack of ''O Brother, Where Are Thou?'' and introduced a few million new listeners to a gripping, venerable singer whose songs about sin, temptation and salvation are cornerstones of country music. Leading his own band, Mr. Stanley is more avuncular than apocalyptic, but his songs still have eerie moments. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30 in advance, $33 at the door. (Pareles) Suishou no Fune (Tuesday) This Tokyo group, whose name means crystal ship, carries on a Japanese underground rocktradition of immersion in both tranquil, spooky psychedelia and rumbling sonic chaos. Like Fushitsusha, its earliest ancestor, Suishou no Fune is transcendent in either extreme. At 8 p.m., with Madeline and Dynamite Arrows, Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036, cake-shop.com; $7. (Sisario) * JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, PINK (Wednesday) Like Michael Jackson or Prince, Justin Timberlake is the kind of pop star who makes it all look easy. But even more endearing, the guy can truly make fun of himself: his brilliant ''Saturday Night Live'' skit with Andy Samberg, bleeped on television but uncensored on the Internet, was the equivalent of a chummy high-five with his audience. Opening the show is Pink, the spark plug who once bragged of getting the party started and now ridicules ''stupid girls'' who torture themselves for men. At 7:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $53 to $151. (Sisario) YOUNG KNIVES (Tuesday and Thursday) The Young Knives, from the tiny English town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, are not the first to pick up Gang of Four's legacy of jagged guitars, uptight punk-funk and lyrics about the angry boredom of the workaday life, but on ''Voices of Animals and Men'' (Transgressive/Ryko), the band does it with worthy verve and wit.

Opera 'DIE √ÑEGYPTISCHE HELENA' (Monday) Not your everyday Richard Strauss opera has a new production at the Metropolitan Opera, and performances continue on Monday. Deborah Voigt stars in the title role, and Fabio Luisi conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $80 to $175. (Bernard Holland) 'ANDREA CHENIER' (Thursday) Set in the 18th century but very much a product of the 19th, Giordano's Italian drama of the French Revolution returns to the Met with a cast that is able to sing very, very loudly, if not always especially elegantly or with particular Italian flair: Violeta Urmana, Ben Heppner and Mark Delavan. Marco Armiliato, emerging as a solid presence in the pit, conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Anne Midgette) * 'IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Bartlett Sher's breezy new production of Rossini's opera, which was introduced in November and returned on Wednesday night, conveys the comic confusions of the story through its fluid staging and a wonderfully abstract set: a matrix of movable doors, staircases and potted orange trees, behind which characters spy on one another. The heated sexuality of the characters also comes through strongly, thanks to Mr. Sher's subtle directing of a handsome cast. The baritone Peter Mattei is a robust and agile Figaro. The tenor Juan Diego Fl√≥rez, sounding fresher than in the fall, could not be more adorable as the amorous Count Almaviva. The captivating mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato is a vocally agile and feisty Rosina. The virile bass-baritone John Relyea makes the wily Don Baisilio seem delightfully dangerous. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $42 to $120 tickets remaining for tomorrow, $15 to $65 for Wednesday. (Anthony Tommasini) * 'LA DONNA DEL LAGO' (Thursday) New York City Opera's last foray into the little-known world of Rossini's serious operas was successful enough that the company is going back for more, with the same two leads featured in ''Ermione'' a few seasons ago. Alexandrina Pendatchanska is an intense, committed soprano; Barry Banks, the tenor, is emerging as someone to watch. Chas Rader-Shieber, the director, has brought an antic touch to his two previous outings with the company, ''Flavio'' (which returns this spring) and ''Orlando.'' George Manahan conducts. At 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $120. (Midgette) 'FAUST' (Tomorrow) Gounod's lush score is back at the Met in Andrei Serban's staging, now less hyperactive than when it was introduced in 2005. Alas, someone appears to have gotten to its soul before M√©phistoph√©l√®s had the chance: the singers, though all fine, put the drama at arm's length, so the work's intense passions don't quite come through. In the cast: Ram√≥n Vargas in the title role, Ruth Ann Swenson as Marguerite and Ildar Abdrazakov as M√©phistoph√©l√®s. At 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $120 to $220 remaining.

At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $115. (Holland) 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' (Tonight through Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) At City Opera, Lillian Groag avoids the topical updating that has become a Gilbert and Sullivan tradition and focuses on the work's own satirical targets, which range from Victorian British society to the conventions of Italian grand opera. Even so, her direction is inventive and lively, as are the performances by a cast that includes Sarah Jane McMahon as Mabel, Matt Morgan as Frederic, Marc Kudisch as the Pirate King and Mark Jacoby as Major General Stanley. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 1:30, Tuesday and Wednesday night at 7:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $25 to $130. (Kozinn) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tonight and Tuesday) For its revival of Franco Zeffirelli's extravagant 1998 production, the Met is rotating casts, with three sopranos sharing the role of Violetta. The earthy Bulgarian soprano Krassimira Stoyanova, who made her Met debut in 2001 and who was recently heard at the house as Nedda in ''Pagliacci,'' sings Violetta, the role of her debut. The compelling German tenor Jonas Kaufmann is Alfredo, Violetta's impulsive lover. And the veteran American baritone Dwayne Croft is Alfredo's tragically interfering father, Germont. Marco Armiliato conducts. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $205. (Tommasini) Classical Music ALARM WILL SOUND (Sunday) This ensemble of young new-music specialists makes a point of ignoring genre barriers. Included in this retrospective are the group's own arrangements of electronica by Aphex Twin, as well as pieces by several of the ensemble's performers. In this context, John Adams (represented by ''Scratchband'') may seem the most conservative composer on the program, and how often does that happen? At 3 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28 to $40. (Kozinn) DIANA DAMRAU (Wednesday) This fine German coloratura soprano, in town for the Met's new production of ''Die √Ñegyptische Helena,'' takes time out to make her New York recital debut with a program of French-language songs by Liszt and Barber, songs (sung in English) by Rachmaninoff, Berg's ''Seven Early Songs,'' Zemlinsky's ''Ges√§nge'' (Op. 6) and, of course, songs by Strauss.

(Midgette) * INGRID FLITER (Wednesday) The career of this Argentine pianist has taken off since winning the 2006 Gilmore Artist Award and its $300,000 prize. Ms. Fliter makes her New York recital debut with a program including Beethoven's C minor Variations (WoO 80); Schubert's Sonata in A (D. 959); and Chopin's Nocturne in D flat (Op. 27, No. 2), ''Barcarolle'' (Op. 60), Ballade in F minor (Op. 52) and Three Mazurkas (Op. 59).

(Vivien Schweitzer) ANDREA GRUBER and RUSSELL THOMAS (Sunday) The wood-paneled auditorium at the Morgan Library & Museum is a warm, resonant space, and it should resound aplenty with the voice of Andrea Gruber, the opera soprano, who will appear in recital with Russell Thomas, a young tenor, under the aegis of the George London Foundation, which pairs established singers with rising ones. The program should contain at least a whiff of opera: it includes music by Beethoven, Duparc, Ponchielli, Puccini and Verdi. Ken Noda is the accompanist. At 4 p.m., 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 877-6347, themorgan.org; $45.

(Dunning) * PEAK PERFORMANCES: VINCENT DANCE THEATER (Thursday) From Sheffield, England, Charlotte Vincent and her modern-dance troupe will make their American debut with ''Broken Chords'' in the Peak Performances avant-garde showcase at Montclair State University. Inspired by Ms. Vincent's divorce, this piece has been described as a portrait of grief, both searing and funny. (Through March 25.) Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, One Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $25. (Dunning) * DESMOND RICHARDSON AND THE ALL STARS PROJECT (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Richardson and 15 performers from All Stars, a cultural program for teenagers from New York City and Newark, have created ''Homeland Security: Bringing Dr. King Up to Date,'' a multimedia piece that questions American notions of ''homeland'' and ''security.''

(Dunning) * Tamango's Urban Tap (Tuesday through Thursday) One of America's few great indigenous art forms, tap is the result of diverse cultures meeting -- and mixing.

(Through March 25.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $36. (La Rocco) * PAUL TAYLOR DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The company's annual season closes this weekend with performances of Mr. Taylor's dark new ''Lines of Loss'' (tonight and tomorrow afternoon); his zany new ''Troilus & Cressida (reduced)'' (tomorrow night); major revivals of his 1976 ''Polaris'' (tonight); and his 1979 ''Profiles'' (tomorrow night). Also, old favorites like ''Company B,'' set to World War II songs sung by the Andrews Sisters (tonight); the lush and serene ''Roses'' (tomorrow afternoon); the hushed ''Sunset,'' and ''Esplanade,'' a feat of athletic dancing that is unruly and calm by turn (Sunday). Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, citycenter.org; $15 to $125.

(Dunning) * ANN LIV YOUNG (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Young's ''Snow White'' departs from the traditional to explore (what else?) the psychosexual tensions between Snow White, her Evil Stepmother (could they be an item?) and her Prince, which run rampant in claustrophobic interiors and kitschy woodlands. (Through March 24.) All performances at 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $12. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * American Folk Art Museum: MART√≠N RAM√≠REZ, through April 29. Ram√≠rez, a Mexican peasant who immigrated to Northern California and died there at 68 in 1963, spent the last 32 years of his life in a mental hospital, making some of the greatest art of the last century. He had his own way with materials and color and an unforgettable cast of characters. But most of all, Ram√≠rez had his own brand of pictorial space, established by rhythmic systems of parallel lines, both curved and straight, whose mesmerizing expansions and contractions simultaneously cosset and isolate his figures. This show should render null and void the distinction between insider and outsider art. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) * Asia Society: Glass, Gilding, and Grand Design: Art of Sasanian Iran (224-642 A.D.), through May 20. With some 70 examples of silver, glass and silk textile fragments, many from European museums, this is the first major exhibition of its kind in this part of the world for more than 30 years. For about four centuries, the Sasanians ruled territory stretching from present-day Iran and Iraq to North Africa. Their only rivals were Rome, Byzantium and, at the very end, the early Islamic dynasties. Much of their surviving art is a sterling example of empire in action. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) FRICK COLLECTION: 'GEORGE STUBBS (1724-1806): A CELEBRATION,' through May 27. One of the finest horse painters ever, Stubbs knew his subjects from head to hoof and skin to bones. He painted other mammals too: dogs, lions, tigers, oxen, monkeys and humans. This intimate show of 17 Stubbs paintings from English collections reveals his admirable range, although the people he portrayed in two large, late canvases, elegiac celebrations of farm workers, have the stiffness of figures on a candy box. His horses are his true monuments. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Grace Glueck) Guggenheim Museum: 'Family Pictures,' through April 16. The museum's news release extends the exhibition's exploration into ''representation of families and children in contemporary art and video.'' Images of children, you quickly realize, can operate as a completely different genre. Rineke Dijkstra's ''Beach Portraits'' of adolescents posing awkwardly against stark seascape horizons are isolated (and isolating) images of children on the threshold of adulthood. You don't think about family when gazing at these photographs. Sally Mann is perhaps the best-known contemporary photographer of children, specifically her own. Ms. Mann, represented here by black-and-white photographs from the late 1980s and early 1990s of her ethereally gorgeous children, has been accused of everything from neglect to child abuse. The questions raised by her dual role as artist and mother, simultaneous protector and potential exploiter of the family, remain vitally interesting. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Martha Schwendener) * Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Mother of Pearl: A Tradition in Asian Lacquer,' through April 1. Ornamentalism is the term for this show of some 40 objects so preposterously exquisite that they might have been conceived with a modern museum conservator's soft white cotton gloves in mind. The technique for creating mini-mosaics from slivers of mollusk shell is an ancient one that was perfected in China before traveling to Korea, Japan, Thailand and India. Examples from all those places are here in writing boxes and tea trays guaranteed to appeal to any window-shopper's acquisitive yearnings and magpie eye. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter) * The METropOlitan museum of art: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Sept. 3. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht D√ºrer, and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Glueck) Museum of modern art: 'COMIC ABSTRACTION: IMAGE-BREAKING, IMAGE-MAKING,' through June 11. This unimaginative and uniformed treatment of a big idea -- the healthy and essential contamination of Modernist abstraction by popular culture -- should be seen if only because it is such a dispiriting symptom of the Modern's paralysis where contemporary art is concerned. Although it promises work that addresses ''perplexing questions,'' nearly everything here is perfectly pleasant and innocuous. The exceptions are provided by Gary Simmons, Ellen Gallagher and Sue Williams. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) * Moma: 'JEFF WALL,' through May 14. This majestic show makes a great case for Mr. Wall as the most complete, if traditional, of the untraditional artists who emerged from the turmoil of Conceptual Art. His often immense color transparencies are enthralling visual vehicles, intent on giving pleasure while making a point or two about society, art, history, visual perception, the human animal or all of the above. An imposing blend of painting, street photography and movies, they blur reality and artifice, narrative and form, detail and the big statement. You can't stop looking at them. (See above.) (Smith) * National Academy Museum: HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES: NEW YORK PAINTING, 1967-1975, through April 22. Organized under the auspices of International Curators Incorporated, this exhibition is the first to tackle a neglected subject: New York painting during the period it was supposed to be dead. The show's 42 works by 37 artists reveal that, far from dead, painting was in fact in an uproar that was commensurate with the artistic, social and political turbulence of the times. The alternation between artists who remained loyal to stretched canvas and those who abandoned it, which makes for clear installation, also tidies up history. The main problem is that the exhibition sticks too purposefully to the margins. Too much of this work is as derivative now as it was then, and functions more as artifact than art. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Gordon MaTTA-cLARK rETROSPECTIVE,' through June 3. I have no doubt that Matta-Clark is now being turned into a hot commercial commodity, but at least at the Whitney you can see what he aspired to be. At the center of the exhibition is ''Splitting.'' To a plain single-family suburban frame house in Englewood, N.J., he made a cut straight down the middle, bisecting the building, then severing the four corners of the roof. The retrospective consists of films, drawings, photographs and some of the architectural pieces he cut out of buildings. The big message was: Life as art, and art as life, a philosophy dependent on our being properly attuned and keen to the moment. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lorna Simpson,' through May 6. This tight, refined and impassioned survey covers more than 20 years of Lorna Simpson's career, from her photo-and-text meditations on race and sexism in the 1980s, to her more recent short films, which unite American history and personal history in forceful and lyrical ways. It would be easy to put some of this work on a shelf as ''identity art,'' but with an African-American woman holding one of the highest offices in the United States government, an African-American man running for president, and the nation embroiled in what some people view as an ethnic war, this art is entirely of the moment. (See above.) (Cotter) Galleries: Chelsea Michael Waugh: 'Lead me astray' Mr. Waugh's work is about close reading. Several large drawings of 19th-century landscapes are composed of handwritten phrases, cut and pasted in nonsensical order, from American presidential inaugural speeches. A drawing of the Spanish colonial explorer Cabeza de Vaca, who landed in Florida, is installed in a room plastered with promotional materials from a different colonialist enterprise, the last Art Basel/Miami fair. Schroeder Romero, 637 West 27th Street, (212) 630-0722; through March 24. (Cotter) Last Chance * Cathy Begien The reason to see this first solo show by the San Francisco filmmaker Cathy Begien is an ingenious, surprisingly intense short video called ''Black Out.'' In it the blindfolded artist delivers an episodic account of a bad-trip, club-hopping night on the town, as friends pop into the frame from the side to hand her drinks and cigarettes and act out parts of the story. When Ms. Begien breaks down toward the end of the film, it's hard to tell whether she's laughing or crying. Both responses make sense. Winkleman Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) * ALINE KOMINSKY CRUMB: 'NEED MORE LOVE' On the occasion of her wonderfully forthright, lavishly illustrated book of the same title, one of the premier cartoonists of her generation and a force in the development of the confessional graphic novel lets quite a bit of it all hang out in paintings, drawings and, best of all, comic strips dating from 1973 to the present. Adam Baumgold Gallery, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338; closes tomorrow. (Smith) EVA AND FRACO MATTES: '13 MOST BEAUTIFUL AVATARS' This artistic duo, best known for media hacking and culture jamming, has turned to digital canvas portraits of avatars -- digital surrogates -- from the online virtual world Second Life. With their flat colors, slightly blocky features and assertive hair, these images have a jaded artifice worthy of ''Blade Runner,'' but are also eerily effective as paintings. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * BAKER OVERSTREET: NEW PAINTINGS Like Keegan McHargue and Devendra Banhart, this young artist has a penchant for tribal motifs, which he flattens into symmetrical compositions and renders with an outsider roughness. The works in his debut show evoke the imagery of the space-ship-obsessed, self-taught artist Ionel Talpazan, as well as Alfred Jensen and Forrest Bess. Their notion of the visionary is both self-conscious and familiar, but they are painted with energetic dispatch and a sure sense of scale, color and wit that encourage you to stay tuned. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6555, fredericksfreisergallery.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG: TRANSFER DRAWINGS FROM THE 1960S This is the first exhibition devoted to the artist's large transfer drawings of the 1960s, which function less as works of art than as refined filtering systems. Their hazy, flickering surfaces mix bits of history (the space race, the civil rights movement, the cold war) with eruptions of weirdly rotelike graphic finesse -- the windshield-wiper strokes with which Rauschenberg brought his images to the surface. Extraordinarily beautiful and hauntingly multifarious, these works show us art, art history and the very times we live in taking shape. Jonathan O'Hara Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-3533; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics' Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids. But more often than not, humor is sugarcoating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter) * 'What F Word?' The ''F word'' in question for this group is feminism, though others come under its purview. The work spans decades, from an apt updating of a Flemish Madonna and child by the estimable and too long overlooked Anita Steckel, to very recent art by Dana Frankfort, Jane Hammond and Shay Nowick. In a brand-new piece, Elaine Reichek brings Ezra Pound into the picture. Ulrike Muller pays tribute to Mina Loy. Patricia Cronin contributes an image of a tomb sculpture she designed, depicting herself and her lover, the artist Deborah Kass (also in the show), embracing on a bed. Cynthia Broan Gallery, 546 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 760-0809, cynthiabroan.com; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)"

      "lead_paragraph": "ON a rare winter weekend when ''Saturday Night Live'' was in reruns and Amy Poehler had not been called upon to play Hillary Clinton, Paula Abdul, Nancy Grace or any of the dozens of women she gleefully cuts down to size, she could have spent her Sunday evening any way she wanted -- say, at home, with the phone disconnected, catching up on much-needed sleep. Instead she was standing on the subterranean stage of the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Chelsea, navigating through another marathon night of performing, this time without the benefit of cue cards or a script. Surrounded by dozens of young audience members dressed in hooded sweatshirts and heavy coats, Ms. Poehler, 35, clad in a vintage Michael Jackson T-shirt and blue jeans, was improvising a skit about rival Ping-Pong players. Furiously swatting at an imaginary ball with a nonexistent paddle, she explained to her opponent -- played by Jack McBrayer, who plays the perpetually optimistic page on the sitcom ''30 Rock'' -- that she'd learned her technique from the self-help documentary ''The Secret.''"

While the world grieved for the Columbia crew lost on Feb. 1, 2003, three lonely men in space had a somewhat more complicated reaction. They were the members of Expedition Six, two Americans and a Russian installed at the International Space Station. They had been there since the previous November, and they were getting ready to come home. But the Challenger disaster suspended space travel, so no new crew would arrive to relieve them in the foreseeable future. Suddenly they were stuck in a sci-fi limbo."

But in a quarter-century of blastoffs here, that bulky, snub-nosed, imperfect craft has gained its own set of admirers and collectors along this space coast."
