The Discovery crew also successfully released the third and last communications satellite from the cargo bay, did some troubleshooting on a balky drug-processing machine and had a telephone conversation with President Reagan. With Judith A. Resnik at the controls, an epoxy-fiberglass mast rose slowly out of the Discovery's cargo bay and brought with it the unfolding sections of the solar panel. These are thin sheets of the plastic material Kapton that had been folded accordionlike. Attached to most of the 84 panels are dummy solar cells, though the outermost panels hold three working cells for converting sunlight to energy."

Space officials now believe the shuttle program is on track technically and will be able to meet the current schedule, which envisons more than 30 more flights by the end of 1986. In this period the agency will seek to establish the shuttle program as a fast-paced, flexible space transportation system to meet the needs of commercial clients such as the owners of communications satellites, as well as the armed forces, which have satellite payload requirements of their own. The perfect launching of the three communications payloads by Discovery's crew in a sense throws down the gauntlet to competing commercial space transportation systems offered by groups in Europe and Asia, as well as the Soviet Union."

Today he is in the final stages of creating his masterwork, a monument to Lenin that will reach about half the height of the Statue of Liberty and will form the centerpiece of a grand square now under reconstruction in central Moscow. It is a project he says he has been working on for 20 years, and one that has confounded Moscow city planners for even longer, as one grandiose plan for a Lenin monument after another has been abandoned. When Mr. Kerbel's statue is unveiled some time in early 1986, it will include a 28-foot bronze statue of Lenin atop a mammoth pink-granite pedestal surrounded by 13 figures whose triumphal poses will depict aspects of the Russian Revolution of 1917."

        "original": "By Harriet Waugh. (St. Martin's, $12.95.) By Margery Safir. (Double day, $14.95.) After meeting Alex Olivier at a literary reception and being swept off his feet, Michel Vernet, a Parisian playwright, returns home and Alex, an irresistible literary groupie as well as a Yale drama teacher, counts the minutes until she can leave her trusting husband, John, and jet across the Atlantic to seduce the writer. The story of their affair is told through alternating first-person accounts, a technique that initially does not result in convincing portraits of either Michel or Alex. When erotic impulses begin to guide the characters, however, Margery Safir's scenes begin to ring true. Anticipating her first evening alone with Michel, Alex admits that she ''felt exhilarated, an unbecoming emotion in a woman likely on the brink of adultery.'' The couple's lovemaking is vividly recounted by Michel, who is completely absorbed in their passion. The moral implications of the affair are explored further when John learns of his wife's infidelity. Alex presents herself as a woman so eager for change in her life that she is ready to inflict pain through lies and deception: ''Rules of Etiquette for an Adulteress, number 1: You are obliged to stand stoically for questioning that otherwise would be insulting to your honor; you are no longer seen as a person of honor.'' On the surface, ''A Woman of Letters'' is the story of Alex's personal growth as told from her viewpoint and Michel's; the book's deeper concern is the effect of Alex's sensual actions on her marriage.-    Mason Buck     * THE CANARY:  And Other Tales of Martial Law. By  Marek Nowakowski. Translated by Krystyna Bronkow ska. (Dial/Doubleday, $11.95.) Marek Nowakowski began publishing these tales in Poland, under his own name in the underground press, shortly after the imposition of martial law in December 1981. Last March he was arrested and served several months in prison. This information is important to readers, for the arrest helps explain the writing (terse, hurried, as if done by a man compelled to look continually over his shoulder), just as the themes - despair, drunkenness, terror - help explain the arrest. The vignettes in ''The Canary,'' most of which are no longer than four pages, begin in the frigid first week of martial law and carry into the summer; the majority take place in Warsaw. One recounts a vetting session for Polish journalists at which all of the writers to be examined arrive shamelessly drunk. A few are nothing more than extended descriptions of a single moment - the nocturnal dance of a drunken patrol unit, an improvident outcry on a bus - that in healthier times (or countries) would be filed away for use as scenery in more sustained works. Yet for Mr. Nowakowski the telling of these tales, even the simplest, could not wait. His colloquial style of short, choppy sentences heightens this sense of urgency. The characters, taken from real life, include an impressive number of curiosities and fogeys: a mysterious midwife living alone and hoarding a warehouse worth of goods; a barber in an army barracks; a doorman informer in an apartment building for foreigners; an inspector with the State Newspaper Distribution Agency who curries favors from the females on his route; a gypsy. Their stories are set against those of the more predictable taxi driver, underground messenger and wartime resistance leader (who frets over his son's brutish schoolmates until he realizes that he can turn them into excellent opposition fighters). Through this dichotomy of types, Mr. Nowakowski presents a portrait of Polish martial law that is as authentic and, ultimately, as grim as any we are likely to see.-    Thomas Swick     * COOL RUNNINGS. By Richard Hoyt. (Viking, $15.95.)   Readers of Richard Hoyt's five previous novels will have noticed a penchant for the outrageous. In ''The Siskiyou Two-Step,'' for example, the Seattle private eye John Denson rides the corpse of a naked woman down Oregon's North Umpqua River. Mr. Hoyt obviously likes a clear field for his imagination, and in ''Cool Runnings'' he energetically rids the landscape of realistic shrubs and stumps. Still, the idea behind this novel is not exceptionally outlandish. A Dutch pacifist organization constructs a nuclear device, omitting the fuel, to demonstrate the dangers of the armaments race. Predictably, the mechanism is stolen and armed with plutonium. Eventually, it turns up in Manhattan, near the Lion's Head bar on Christopher Street, to be exact. What makes this tale different from other similar scenarios is Mr. Hoyt's sense of humor, which is applied in the broadest possible strokes. Chasing the elusive bomb are, at one time or another, a pot-smoking reporter for Rolling Stone; agents of the C.I.A., the French S^urete and the British secret service; a crazed Japanese fascist homosexual; a Jamaican dope smuggler; and a short, hairy New York long-distance runner. None of these characters is presented seriously, and, because the narrative is riddled with arch or just plain silly vignettes, the betrayals and deaths, even the possibility of Manhattan's nuclear demise, simply do not grip us. True, even such old hands as Richard Condon and Ross Thomas have not always matriculated successfully in the wise-guy school of writing, but usually they make a pretense of allaying our skepticism. Mr. Hoyt does not require that we suspend disbelief, only that we find him amusing. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't. -    Arthur Krystal     * SALAD DAYS. By Fran,coise Sagan. Translated by C. J.  Richards. (Dutton, $13.95.) The hero is Gueret, an ineffectual, 27-year-old bookkeeper with a past - and seemingly a future - as colorless as the landscape of the industrial town in northeast France where he lives. The heroine is Maria, his landlady, who, in her 50's, is bitter and brittle and has seen better days in Marseilles. ''Salad Days'' is the mordantly romantic story that Fran,coise Sagan has written about their love affair. One day, quite by chance, Gueret stumbles on a sack of jewels for which a man was reportedly knifed to death. He takes the jewels home and hides them. Maria finds the loot and is drawn to Gueret not for their value but for the deed she thinks he performed to get them. He leads her to believe he is a killer because he is in love with her and can't risk her disillusionment. The recounting of their courtship - nights on the town with her alternately masquerading as his aunt or his mother, dreams of escape to Senegal once the gems are sold - hold the morbid fascination of watching a tragic accident. Much as you might want to avert your eyes to avoid seeing the confusion, pathos and pain, you're mesmerized into staring, hoping that, as bad as things may seem, the people caught in the wreckage will come out alive. In ''Salad Days'' the quirky love affair blooms until Maria discovers that the real killer has confessed. Rather than lose her love, Gueret sets out to prove his worth. Miss Sagan has been turning out poignantly understated novels of love and loss (''Bonjour Tristesse,'' ''Aimez- Vous Brahms?,'' ''The Painted Lady'') for nearly 30 years, cooking up a nouvelle cuisine of prose. In ''Salad Days,'' she pares and slices each morsel of text with the attention to clarity and detail of a chef in a good French restaurant.-    Kiki Olson        NONFICTIONTHE DEATH MERCHANT: The Rise and Fall of Edwin P. Wilson. By Joseph C. Goulden with Alexander W. Raffio. (Simon & Schuster, $17.95.)By Linda Dahl. (Pantheon, Cloth, $19.95. Paper, 12.95.) By Evan Luard (St. Martin's, $27.50.) By Norrie Huddle.

      "lead_paragraph": "-year-old named Kate, while populating and furnishing her new doll house, creates fantasies that - unknown to her - are acted out by the real-life occupants of a rooming house miles away in central London. Since dolls, like art, imitate life, the events Kate inflicts upon her miniatures mimic the goings-on of her own real-life household in placid Wimbledon Common. Such a premise for a novel may feel awkward at first, but Miss Waugh's smooth and generous descriptive prose will win you over. Writing in a flat, ironic tone, that oh-so-British trademark of satiric fiction, Miss Waugh creates a world like that of her father, Evelyn, in which anything goes. This includes a virgin birth and the metamorphosis of a poodle into an apocalyptic, baby-eating dragon. And when Rumania, Kate's mother, gets pregnant, so does one of Kate's dolls. Margery MacDonald, an unrelated rooming house occupant in Notting Hill does, too. Margery's is the virgin birth. What makes ''Kate's House'' delightful is partly the fun Miss Waugh pokes at middle-class values - both those particularly British, like doting on the Royal Family, and those more universal, like Roman Catholicism and racial prejudice (Margery thinks that black people are the ''incubators of strange germs''). But the charm of this novel derives also from Kate herself. When Kate shaves the hair off all her stuffed animals, Miss Waugh is re-creating the innocently macabre humor resplendent among 4-year-olds. In case you forgot what that was like, ''Kate's House'' will help you remember."

      "lead_paragraph": "It streaked over the desert in the California dawn, announcing its arrival with a double sonic boom. Then it arched into the familiar 180-degree turn and touched down before a rising sun - a picture-perfect ending to last week's maiden mission of the space shuttle Discovery. There were minor bugs - a chunk of ice that formed around a waste water vent had to be swatted away with the craft's space arm and a small oxygen leak briefly knotted some brows - but they were overshadowed by the six-day flight's triumphs. Three satellites were catapulted into orbit (redemption for two failed launches from the sister ship Challenger in February), a 102-foot solar panel was unfurled and an experimental drug-manufacturing device took advantage of the weightlessness to produce a sample of an ultrapure hormone. Not that there was much time for Discovery to rest on its laurels. The schedule called for it to be piggybacked onto a Boeing 747 for the trip this weekend back to the Cape Canaveral pad and, NASA hopes, a November launch. At long last, the shuttle is starting to live up to its name."

''Get tough'' with President Reagan, the Democratic elders have told their nominee. Then, in the next breath comes the solemn warning that, of course, Mr. Reagan is so popular that it would be a deadly political mistake for anyone to attack him ''personally.'' So Mr. Mondale has been handed an almost impossible assignment. He must criticize his opponent harshly enough to destroy Mr. Reagan's lead of 10 to 15 percentage points in the public opinion polls. But he is being called upon to deliver this criticism so deftly and politely that no voter is offended."

The shuttle is scheduled to be launched Nov. 2 on a mission in which it will place two communications satellites into orbit and will try to rescue two others that were left in useless orbits in February after their booster rockets misfired. The space agency signed a a preliminary contract Thursday with Merritt Syndicates Ltd. of London to retrieve Western Union's Westar 6, according to Chet Lee, head of customer services for the shuttle program. An earlier contract was signed with Merritt and International Technology Underwriters of Washington in August to rescue Palapa B-2, which was originally owned by the Indonesian Government."
