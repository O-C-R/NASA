Chemists can now rearrange the loops and chains of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen in plastics not only to make them lighter, cheaper and better protectors of perishables, but to give them extraordinary properties as well. They can be made to conduct electricity, or to possess the strength of steel. For consumers, the first rumbles of the revolution can already be heard. A plastic automotive engine has been built, giving better fuel efficiency, and on the horizon are lightweight plastic batteries, fuel cells and paper-thin arrays of solar cells that can be pulled off a roll like so much Saran Wrap."

      "lead_paragraph": "When Tom Wolfe wrote about the Mercury astronauts in ''The Right Stuff,'' he redefined their heroism in terms that a whole new generation could understand. The astronauts' ''own'' (they worked closely with the staff of Life magazine) account of their exploits, ''We Seven,'' was written in 1962 and presents an outstandingly bland portrait geared to the American temperament of that time. ''What kind of man,'' the Life writers' introduction asks, ''would be strong enough physically to sustain the tremendous stresses and strains of a flight through space, and then be wise enough - and strong enough in other ways - to sustain the pressures of public adulation when he returned home?'' The answers prove to be as upbeat and unsurprising as the question is rhetorical. Mr. Wolfe, without detracting from the courage of the astronauts or the importance of their achievements, managed to describe their heroism in a brilliantly flamboyant style that was both celebratory and wry, a style attuned to an era in which traditional-seeming heroes are regarded with as much suspicion as wonder. His book captured the ironies of the astronauts' situation, the stubborn competitiveness that had brought them to the top of their profession, the routine humiliation of the testing process to which they were subjected and the exhilaration of flight that made their prodigious efforts worthwhile. Aside from being infinitely more colorful than their own, Mr. Wolfe's vision of the astronauts cast their heroism in human terms and effectively contrasted the pettier aspects of their experience with the vastness of their triumphs. It placed their achievements in a larger perspective, and it displayed a conviction that modern heroism can incorporate luck, brashness and humor along with the more traditional attributes."

At a meeting in Washington, the state and local officials of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. industrial unions dutifully applaud former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, the 100 percent union man they will later endorse. But when John Glenn comes in, they line up with their cameras to snap his picture."

It's the 30- year saga of a mother and daughter; the story of a charmingly eccentric woman who, in her 50's, finally permits herself to fall in love; and the chronicle of a troubled marriage between a young professor and his whimsical bride. It's a comedy, offbeat and lighthearted, then turns painfully and unexpectedly tragic in its final half hour. A lesser movie might flail hopelessly between such drastic extremes, and ''Terms of Endearment'' does falter here and there. But it somehow manages to incorporate a great many dramatic threads. If it doesn't always do so with the utmost grace or economy, neither does it ever fail to be enormously appealing, thanks to the bright, witty, larger- than-life performances that James Brooks has elicited from his stars."

      "lead_paragraph": "When John Glenn and Walter F. Mondale exchanged political broadsides on the nation's defense last week, their statements reflected their differences over the years. Mr. Mondale has consistently been more skeptical of big new military proposals, and Mr. Glenn has been more wary of arms control agreements. Senator Glenn accused the former Vice President last week of showing ''a fundamental lack of support for an adequate national defense.'' Mr. Mondale, evidently surprised by the timing of the attack, retorted that the Ohio Senator would give ''a blank check to the Pentagon,'' and he asserted that the former astronaut was ''out of step with the Democratic Party and the country'' on military and national security issues. Similar differences emerged from an examination of public statements and votes cast in the Senate by the two men, now rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Mr. Glenn has voted for the B-1 bomber not merely, he says, because its engines are manufactured in his home state but because he sees it as valuable for delivering both conventional and nuclear weapons. Mr. Mondale has opposed the B-1, saying it would not be needed if the United States had radar-evading Stealth bombers to replace its aging fleet of B-52's. The first deliveries of Stealth bombers are scheduled for the early 1990's."

The critical question, they say, is whether Mr. Mondale's winning margin in the Iowa Democratic caucuses next February will be modest or impressive. ''I think he's got to have 50 percent of the vote,'' said Lieut. Gov. Robert Anderson, who heads the Iowa campaign for Senator John Glenn of Ohio. ''If he comes out with 35 percent, he's lost. After all, this is Mondale territory. He grew up next door in Minnesota, just a few miles across the state line. He's been coming to Iowa for years.''"

Preparations continued to run smoothly toward a planned liftoff at 11 A.M. for the ninth space shuttle mission, the first to carry a large pressurized laboratory in which astronauts and scientists can conduct experiments and scientific observations. Only the weather gave launching officials at the Kennedy Space Center cause for concern. A cold front moving here from the west threatened to bring rain and possibly thunderstorms by liftoff time."

By the end of the year, Mr. Glenn hopes to have raised $6 million to $7 million, and, like Mr. Mondale, will seek more than $1.5 million a month between January and the Democratic convention in July, said Mr. Glenn's campaign treasurer, Robert A. Farmer, a Boston publisher. ''The problem for us is Mondale began raising money with his own political action committee two weeks after Reagan was inaugurated,'' said Mr. Farmer. ''This allowed him to have a political base, it gave him money to travel, money to solicit for direct mail. He identified the 200 top fund-raisers in the party, he played tennis with them in Beverly Hills and had lunch with them in New York and Washington.''"

The Columbia was launched on its journey on schedule at 11 A.M. Eastern standard time after what officials at the Kennedy Space Center described as an almost perfect countdown, free of any serious problems. Within hours the Columbia had settled into a 155-mile-high orbit and the astronauts and scientists were going about their tasks in the 17-ton, 23-foot- long Spacelab that occupies the shuttle's cargo bay. The laboratory, built in West Germany for the European Space Agency at a cost of $1 billion, is outfitted with instruments to conduct more than 70 experiments in astronomy, atmospheric physics, materials processing, earth observations and physiology. Spacelab Unharmed by Liftoff Initial reports indicated that the Spacelab and its complex apparatus had survived the jolt of liftoff and appeared to be in good condition. Communications between the laboratory and ground stations, by a satellite link, were checked out and found to be loud and clear. Television images of the crew's early work in the Spacelab were transmitted by the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite."
