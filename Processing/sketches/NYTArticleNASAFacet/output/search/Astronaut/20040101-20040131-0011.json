Though a freeze-dried desert today, it was once warm and wet, with lakes, rivers, active volcanoes and a thick atmosphere -- all conditions conducive to life. Microbes might even remain alive there, lurking in liquid aquifers deep beneath the permafrost."

At Mission Control, in the aftermath of Neil Armstrong's ''one small step,'' delirious cheering has given way to smiling contentment as NASA personnel bask in the satisfaction of their achievement. But among the reporters present, Apollo's luster had already faded. ''By an hour and a half of the moon walk they were bored,'' Mailer writes. ''Some were actually slipping out.'' The journalists at Mission Control weren't the only ones quickly bored by Apollo. The Apollo 13 mission wasn't even televised nationally; only when it ran into life-threatening trouble did the networks -- and the American public -- pay attention."

The numbers assume that Congress will eventually approve the $15.4 billion for the fiscal year that began in October 2003."

Mauna Kea is without question one of the nation's leading scientific research facilities. One can therefore imagine the outcry that would follow if the University of Hawaii, which manages Mauna Kea, announced one day that the telescopes would be demolished because of budgetary constraints.
