The animals seemed healthy and relaxed and even appeared to enjoy their peculiar environment, although the monkey bred in the Boston area was just picking at it food, obviously bored with its diet of banana pellets. But it was in good spirits and even waved at the audience right on cue when a television camera was poked into its cage. Dr. William E. Thornton, one of two physician-astronauts serving on the Spacelab where the animals are caged, said the Boston monkey was ill briefly after liftoff, but that he himself would have liked to have adapted to the rigors of space as quickly as the monkeys had."

The group includes two teachers each from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut."

When Dr. Paul Calla-han, the biochemist in charge of the animal experiments for the current Challenger shuttle flight, was asked how sick one of the squirrel monkeys on board was, he replied ''two garns.'' It was homage to Senator Jake Garn, the Utah Republican who was on the last shuttle flight a month ago and suffered from space sickness almost from the very start of the mission. He was so ill that he needed help walking after the spaceplane landed. ''I knew exactly how the crew felt,'' the Senator said on Monday after the Challenger blasted off and the first reports came in about the monkey's ''two-garn'' sickness."

It was nine years ago when she cracked the binding on the first small red book and wrote, in the meticulous handwriting of someone starting something new and remarkable, ''July 7, 1976 - What a Day!'' It was a historic day, a day when Carol Barkalow became one of the first 119 young women to enter the United States Military Academy at West Point, a school that had thrived as the all-male preserve of the Army career officer for 174 years. And now, after four years at the Academy and five years in the military, Captain Barkalow still skims the diaries and assesses her growth from an awkward young cadet who broke the zipper in her pants on her first day at West Point to a polished officer and woman."

It is the rare television ''special'' nowadays that isn't buttressed with the ballyhoo of supposedly prestigious book tie-ins and massive publicity campaigns. The multimillion-dollar hustle has become a commonplace, a norm for doing business. A height, or nadir, of sorts is reached in ''Lace II,'' a four-hour movie that will be offered on ABC tonight and tomorrow at 9. ''Lace II'' is just possibly the ultimate in electronic swill. Those connected with its packaging will no doubt be giggling all the way to the bank, but few are likely to be silly enough to claim a smidgin of pride. Formula programming, of course, has long been a staple of television, especially in the series that have to be churned out week after week. It is hardly a secret that network executives want an action-adventure program to have an attention-getting car chase or fist fight approximately every seven-and-a-half minutes. Within those constraints, an imaginative producer might, every once in a while, be able to devise a ''Rockford Files'' or a ''Hill Street Blues,'' but the general programming landscape remains fairly ordinary."

There is, it seems, a growing recognition of space flight as an enduring phenomenon that may well transcend all previous human experience. Reflections on the origin, experiences and meaning of spacefaring have been offered recently in books, movies and television programs. Tom Wolfe's ''Right Stuff,'' the book and the movie, evoked the early days of the American space experience. James A. Michener's ''Space,'' the novel and the television mini-series last month, enlarged on the experience to shape a fictional epic of the past 40 years. (Some critics called the television version a space soap opera; if so, what better confirmation that space flight is being assimilated into everyday life?) And last month, Walter A. McDougal, a Berkeley historian, published ''The Heavens and the Earth,'' the first definitive political history of the space age. Now, the Public Broadcasting Service has moved to the launching pad a documentary, ''Spaceflight,'' covering the history of space exploration from the early theorists, visionaries and rocket pioneers through the dramatic moon landings to the flights of the space shuttle and the prospects of star wars. The first of the four hour-long segments will be shown Wednesday evening at 8 on Channel 13."

      "lead_paragraph": "Q. So which is it? How does one pronounce correctly the name of the comet now hurtling sunward? Is it Halley's (hail-eez), as I have always been led to believe, or Halley's (hal-eez)? A. In Edmond Halley's time (1656-1742), comets were more predictable than spellings of his name. Contemporary accounts refer to him as Hailey, Haley, Halley, Haly, Hawley, Hawly and Hayley, and presumably pronunciations varied as widely. Nigel Calder, in his 1980 book ''The Comet Is Coming,'' discussed the three most common pronunciations: ''Ha-li, rhyming with alley, the obvious one for anyone accustomed to the peculiarities of English spelling. Ha-li, rhyming with bailey, often preferred by those who grew up with the pop group known as Bill Haley and the Comets. Ho-li rhyming with bawley, favoured by Colin Ronan, one of Halley's biographers. . . . We telephoned 16 Halleys living in London to ask them what they called themselves. Three declined to say but every one of the remainder admitted to ha-li (rhyming with alley). With such an overwhelming verdict about the present pronunciation of the name there was no point in continuing the survey.'' Q. Is it true that the Great Wall of China is the only manmade feature on Earth visible from the Moon? A. As astronauts prepared for the first moon missions, it was widely speculated that the Great Wall would be the only manmade feature visible from the lunar surface 240,000 miles away. In fact, the faint, zig-zag line of the wall and all other artifacts blend into the background of browns, greens, blues and whites of Earth at altitudes of as little as 400 miles."

Others are an archeologist turned futurist and an admitted ''space nut'' who writes about sports. They are among the 118 school teachers nationwide, two from each state and United States territory, to be selected by education officials as candidates for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Teacher in Space project. More than 10,000 teachers applied to ride in the space shuttle. The space agency will choose 10 semifinalists at a meeting in June and brief them in Houston in July. One is to fly on a space shuttle mission early next year as the first private citizen in space."

The beginning of Ramadan varies each year as it depends on the sighting of the new moon by Moslem sheiks, traditionally in Saudi Arabia, where Islam's most holy shrines are situated. Egyptian newspapers predicted today that Ramadan, observed as the month in which the tenets of the religion were first revealed to its prophet, Mohammed, would start on Monday. Quoting what it called ''reliable sources'' at the Ujairy Observatory in Kuwait, the papers said the new moon would be visible then for 39 minutes."
