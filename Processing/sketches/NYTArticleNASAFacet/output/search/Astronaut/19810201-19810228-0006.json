By David Abrahamson Nine days ago, three men climbed inside a cramped compression chamber at Duke University, planning not to re-emerge until the end of this month, or perhaps early March. They are preparing to proceed to the frontiers of experimental science, and then perhaps even further, out beyond the knowns and givens of physics and physiology. And the direction they are headed - although they will not descend an inch -is ''down.'' If everything has gone according to plan, the chamber will have been pressurized until it reached a simulated underwater ''depth'' of 2,132 feet early last Thursday evening. And since Friday morning the men will have been performing a complicated series of physiological and neurological tests to determine how well they are standing up under the crushing pressure."

At the department, where the success of public tributes is determined by the amount of refuse hurled at the passing heroes, officials calculated that 971 tons of paper fell on the 21 former hostages who made their way up Broadway in open cars from Battery Park to City Hall."

By MARTIN TOLCHIN ''I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm terrified,'' said my daughter, Karen, l0 years old, at the end of her first week on skis, as she used wedge turns to negotiate an icy intermediate slope at Berkshire East in western Massachusetts. ''Psychedelic,'' shouted her brother, Charles, l2, who also had never skied before, as he streaked past us, fearlessly executing parallel turns - which remained just beyond my ability. My wife, Susan, whose idea of a winter vacation is a Carribbean island - and who on the first day had to be coaxed onto skis - was gamely attempting snowplow turns on the bunny slope. Whatever our problems, Berkshire East turned out to be an ideal place for the four of us to learn together on our first family ski trip. It is a family ski area, with lots of children schussing around, a low-key atmosphere, lift lines that are short and prices that are lower than at many larger resorts."

Numerous interviews with members of Congress and their staffs indicate that new legislation to stimulate industrial innovation is certain to be pushed strongly in the new Congress, though there is disagreement over where the Government's role should start and stop. Meanwhile, the breeder reactor program, long favored by the nuclear power industry but stalled by President Carter and the old Senate, will find a much more favorable climate in a more conservative Congress. And the beleaguered space program is expected to have an important new friend in the old astronaut, Harrison H. Schmidt, recycled as the junior Senator from New Mexico and new Republican chairman of the subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space."

A countdown rehearsal is set to begin about 9:45 P.M. tomorrow at the Kennedy Space Center. It will be identical in almost every respect with the real flight, which is scheduled for April. All systems in the spacecraft, a 184-foot-tall cluster with the deltawing orbiter Columbia mounted on a huge fuel tank and bracketed by two rocket boosters, will be activated and checked out. Fuel will be pumped in and the tanks pressurized. Then, if no unresolvable problems arise, Columbia's three main rocket engines will be ignited about 7:45 A.M. Wednesday, throttled to full power and shut down after only 20 seconds. The spacecraft will be held to the pad by eight metal bolts while instruments monitor the engines' performance for any disturbing sputterings or vibrations, anything to suggest that they are less than ready for the planned three-day, 36-orbit test flight."
