For more than an hour as midnight approached on Thursday, the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton fielded questions selected by the event's organizers. In all the talk about Africa, Social Security and health care, impeachment and Monica S. Lewinsky went unmentioned. At midnight the President kissed his wife, then joined in a toast and sang along to ''Auld Lang Syne.''"

''Who let a Russian in here?'' she replied. It was a better joke than she knew. As things turned out, NASA insisted on two more tests of the Redstone rocket -- one unmanned and one with Ham the chimpanzee -- and by the time Shepard was ready to go, on May 5, Yuri Gagarin had already been there and back. ''We had 'em,'' Shepard said. ''We had 'em by the short hairs, and we gave it away.''"

Apparently, in their desperate search for macho stimulation, young men are reduced to tuning in to wrestling shows in which the fighters hit their opponents with metal folding chairs (this sort of thing is done much more convincingly on ''The Jerry Springer Show'') and lowbrow documentary programming like ''World's Wildest Police Videos'' on Fox. During a recent episode, there was, judging by the number of sirens, more action going on outside my living room window (on West End Avenue) than on the screen."
