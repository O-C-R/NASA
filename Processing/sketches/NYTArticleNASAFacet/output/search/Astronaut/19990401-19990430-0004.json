      "lead_paragraph": "The Japanese Minimalist electronic composer Ryoji Ikeda makes stainless-steel music. It's not of the physical world; nowhere in it can one recognize a traditional instrument. His pieces are constructed out of sine waves and tiny electronic connection noises, short beeping tones and radio static, and the occasional report of an astronaut or some news commentary. They have information-age connotations, but they spell beauty not overload. Mr. Ikeda arranges the elements of his pieces delicately, with a lot of empty space and nearly subliminal sounds; the care in their design not only precludes boredom (a clear hazard with the new, abstract electronic music) but also rearranges your senses. You can almost see the music pass before your eyes."

But the Kosovo campaign is a war fought by committee, the 19-nation alliance, and the American request ran up against objections. A1 In listing its bombing targets in Yugoslavia, NATO has generally described them as installations that feed the war machine of President Slobodan Milosevic. What the alliance does not usually say is that some of the refineries and factories have also been chosen as targets because they are run by close cronies of the Yugoslav President. A1"
