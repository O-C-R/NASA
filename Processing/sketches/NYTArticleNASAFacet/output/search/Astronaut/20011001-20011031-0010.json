While it enshrines rich history, Cape Canaveral is very much living in the present: the Kennedy Space Center and the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station remain working installations."

What you may say after sitting through it is that you've never seen so many kinds of leftovers crammed between the same two slices of bread. Its purview is emphatically perverse, a salute to the Midnight Movie, a cultural land mass that spawned John Waters and David Lynch. ''Astronaut,'' which soars as much as it crashes, made the rounds on the film festival circuit this year, and it's easy to see why none of the mini-majors or ersatz boutique studios picked it up; they wouldn't have known what to do with the kinds of reactions this singular film causes. (It is being released by Artistic License Films and BNS Productions.)"

In particular, boys' costumes, which traditionally tend toward a guts-and-gore theme, are being toned down. And while fire and police outfits were the immediate favorites in September, more recently a variety of other patriotic costumes have become the top choice: army uniforms and Uncle Sam suits are leading the pack. ''People are now seeking looks that show pride in New York and in America,'' said Sharon Sternheim, owner of Zittles toy store on Madison Avenue and 76th Street. ''Last week, we sold out of military camouflage, the American flag and the Statue of Liberty within days.'' According to Ms. Sternheim, parents who prefer less violent or nationalistic looks for their offspring are opting for costumes of astronauts ($35), NASA pilots ($35) and American legends like Davy Crockett ($65). And while standards like Superman and Batman are having moderate success, Ms. Sternheim said, at the moment customers ''want real-life heroes, not make-believe ones.''"
