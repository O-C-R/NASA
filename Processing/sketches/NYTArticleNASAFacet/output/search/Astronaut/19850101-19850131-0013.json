They confess admiration for my work, then ask me for favors. I try to accept their praise. However, I can't do anything for these people. The guy they want is someone else, a photographer known for his elegant fashion work, who also lives in New York. I found out about him several years ago. I was just out of graduate school, a teacher in a private high school living on a teacher's salary in Manhattan, which is to say I had a roommate. We split expenses. He paid for the heat; I took care of the phone, so it was listed in my name. A common enough arrangement, and a pretty good one. What got on our nerves were the phone calls for the other Bruce Weber. My roommate and I were new in town at the time. Not many people knew us, much less about us, so the phone's ringing was a relatively big deal. The potential of it - a job offer, an inheritance, a girl. When you were that young, you still think a phone call can change your life. Most of the time, though (I took half a dozen phone calls a week myself), it was: ''Is this Bruce Weber, the photographer?''"

Although both Houses will then be in recess until Inauguration Day, Jan. 21, the new Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, has announced plans to meet this week with Republican legislators and Administration officials in an attempt to come up with a budget and deficit-reduction package. The judicial branch of the Federal Government will resume work today as the Supreme Court returns from a four-week recess. And at the White House, it looks like a quiet few days for President Reagan as his press office has announced no public engagements for this week. Attention no doubt is being focused on the budget process and on Geneva, where Secretary of State George P. Shultz is meeting today and tomorrow with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union in an effort to restart the arms control negotiations."

Well, all that has changed. During the next mission, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 23, the crew of the space shuttle Discovery will be consuming comparatively normal dishes such as green beans with mushrooms and meatballs with barbecue sauce. Since the mission is primarily a military one, its duration is a secret. Much of the food is bought right off the shelf in groceries in the Houston area and freeze-dried or repackaged. All the space traveler has to do now is float over to the galley, squirt six ounces of water into a food pack, heat and serve. What has made this possible is the realization that scientists' initial apprehensions - particularly the belief that weightlessness would make it difficult to chew and swallow food - were groundless and that space travel requires no special diet. Astronauts require only safe, nutritious fare that is easy to prepare. Indeed, 12 hours before each flight the shuttle is loaded with fresh bananas, oranges, peaches, carrots, celery, bread and the like for the first few days. Since the orbiter has no refrigerator, the astronauts rely on packaged foods later in the flight."

With a whoosh, he ascended into the air, zoomed above the field for a few moments and eventually landed near the sideline. Another 30-yard gain. That wasn't Joe Montana, of course. Come to think of it, that couldn't have been him. Joe Montana always lands in the end zone."

      "lead_paragraph": "Wherever it is going, whatever it is carrying, however long its planned mission, the space shuttle Discovery took off this afternoon on the first flight of American astronauts dedicated exclusively to secret military objectives. Launching time, which had been one of the best-kept secrets of the mission, was 2:50 P.M. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, complying with the elaborate security rules imposed by the Defense Department, would not disclose even after the fact whether the liftoff came on schedule, but it was clearly visible to spectators at the the press viewing site three miles away. Such information, the Air Force added, might provide important clues as to the identity and purpose of the secret payload in the discovery's cargo bay. Reports About Mission Published reports have described the payload as a 5,000-pound electronic intelligence-gathering satellite capable of monitoring missile tests and intercepting military and diplomatic telecommunications of the Soviet Union. A likely major use of the satellite will be to help warn of Soviet preparations for a nuclear attack on the United States, according to military experts outside the Government. (Page A12.)"

The Celestis Group of Melbourne, Fla., signed a contract last week with Space Services Inc., based in Houston, to fire a payload of cremated human remains into an orbit at 1,900 miles above the earth. Donald K. Slayton, one of the original seven American astronauts, is president of Space Services. He said the mission would cost about $15 million and was scheduled for late 1986 or 1987."

Meanwhile, with the successful performance of the satellite-boosting rocket on the flight, engineering teams here at the Kennedy Space Center pressed ahead with preparations for the next shuttle flight, set for launching Feb. 20. Space agency officials expressed cautious optimism that the Challenger, one of the Discovery's sister ships, would be ready in time for the flight. It is undergoing extensive repair of its heat-shielding tiles, many of which came loose after the Challenger's last flight in October. More than 4,000 of the shuttle's 30,000 tiles have had to be replaced and rebonded to the fuselage."
