They are not grade-school siblings begging their father to build them a backyard fort, nor environmental advocates plotting a yearlong stay at the top of a redwood to protest logging practices. They are just a pleasant couple from Southern California -- he a 64-year-old semiretired real estate developer and she a 50-something former teacher -- who want to live part time in a tree. Two years ago, they bought 80 rocky acres several hours from their house in La Jolla. Now that they have transformed it with apple orchards, olive trees, grapevines, wild turkeys, pheasants, even 13-foot sunflowers, they need a place to stay and enjoy it. So they are planning a treehouse. A $150,000 treehouse, to be precise."

My seemingly textbook-perfect in vitro fertilization procedure -- in which I had six very good embryos and my doctor transferred the three most beautiful, symmetrical and hearty-looking of the batch to my uterus -- also failed for no discernible reason. ''It's probably chromosomes,'' my doctor said, after explaining that embryos with chromosomal abnormalities aren't as likely to attach to the uterus. ''But we just can't tell.'' Which left me wondering about the three embryos that my doctor hadn't put in my womb, the ones left behind to disintegrate in the lab. Were they the healthy ones? Were they the ones that would have resulted in a baby? Recently, my doctor suggested a somewhat controversial procedure that might offer answers. Known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or P.G.D., the procedure is a bit like an early checkup on a baby-to-be, except it would take place before I even had a fetus. It would occur while my embryos sat in a petri dish and were a mere six to eight cells -- smaller than specks of dust."

One tree has been planted in honor of each astronaut who has died, whether in the line of duty or from accidents or disease. Until Feb. 1, the grove had 33 trees. George W. S. Abbey, who began the grove in 1996 when he was director of the center, said when asked about the memorial: ''Now, unfortunately, we have to plant seven more. All at once.''"

Tom Cruise stars as Jerry, a high-powered sports agent who loses his job for having a brief attack of principle. Renée Zellweger is Dorothy, the adoring agency employee who joins him in his new business. Cuba Gooding Jr., who won the best supporting actor Oscar, is their only client, a football player in a slump. Dorothy's sister (Bonnie Hunt) has the film's real best line. Waiting to meet Dorothy's date, Jerry, she says, ''I just hope he's not good-looking'' -- Monday at 10:30 p.m. and Saturday at 6:30 p.m. on Showtime. Vincent Freeman wants to be an astronaut. But in Andrew Niccol's futuristic GATTACA (1997), only perfect human specimens are allowed to go into space, and Vincent (Ethan Hawke) was conceived the old-fashioned way, not genetically engineered like everybody else. So he fakes an identity, stealing it from Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), a star swimmer until an accident paralyzed him. One day, Vincent leaves one of his own eyelashes lying around in the wrong place, its DNA establishes that he's not ''valid,'' and we have ourselves a crime thriller. Uma Thurman is Vincent's puzzled but good-hearted love interest -- Sunday at 9 a.m. on Sci Fi."

Walk along the platform overlooking the auditorium and what comes into view, bit by bit, are found objects picked up from Los Angeles curb sides, prop houses and the nearby desert: the cockpit of an airplane, an inch-high plastic astronaut, a lopsided fireplace, a cedar-sided Jacuzzi, an upright piano, a slumping picket fence. Light bulbs blink, fans turn and television screens flicker while rivers of electrical wire zigzag about like arteries in search of a heart. An incongruous neo-Classical column lying on its side bisects the space."
