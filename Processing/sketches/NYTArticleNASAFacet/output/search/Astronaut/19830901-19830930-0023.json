      "lead_paragraph": "The Challenger astronauts successfully launched a communications- weather satellite for India early today and received a telephone call from President Reagan, who said the presence of a black in the crew was evidence that ''we are in an era of brotherhood here in our land.'' The black astronaut, Lieut. Col. Guion S. Bluford Jr. of the Air Force, directed the deployment of the Insat-1B satellite at 3:49 A.M. An attached rocket then boosted the 2,400-pound satellite toward its higher orbital position over the Indian Ocean, where Indian officials expect it to provide a major improvement in the nation's telecommunications network. After the satellite sprang free of the space shuttle's cargo bay, Colonel Bluford reported to Mission Control: ''The deployment was on time and the satellite looks good.'' Later in the morning, on the Challenger's 23d revolution of the earth, Mr. Reagan spoke to the five astronauts from his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif. The spaceship was flying 184 miles over Hawaii at the time."

But periodic malfunctions, particularly with computers at a ground tracking station, continued to plague the mission's test of a new spacecraft communications link. Project officials said extensive trouble-shooting and some alterations in the system would be needed before the new communitions channels, which are routed through an orbiting satellite, can support the next shuttle flight as planned. On the Challenger's third day in orbit, Lieut. Cmdr. Dale A. Gardner of the Navy spent more than five hours operating the shuttle's 50-foot-long mechanical arm. He practiced lifting a 7,460-pound dummy spacecraft, a hulk of aluminum and lead, and moving it about in the cargo bay."

Captain Truly, you've completed about two-thirds of your flight now. What is your assessment of the mission accomplishments so far? CAPTAIN RICHARD H. TRULY: So far I would say that the flight has been extremely sucessful. We've had a great time watching the fireworks on the night launch, the C.F.E.S. operation and the Insat deploy and the word we've heard from Mission Control on Insat are that it's working very well. And the T.D.R.S. testing has gone very well. I'm very happy about it. How does it look down there? Q. It looks great so far. Colonel Bluford, President Reagan on Wednesday congratulated you for paving the way for other blacks in space. You didn't have a chance to respond then. What would you like to say about your flight, what is its significance as far as blacks are concerned?"

The astronauts' flight plan called for their six days in space to end with a landing here at 12:40 Monday morning, California time. They were to steer the huge winged spaceship to the first nighttime landing to demonstrate that, if necessary, the shuttles could return home at any hour. The five-member crew, which has been living a reversed day-night cycle this mission, awoke early this evening to begin storing gear and preparing for their descent from an orbit 139 miles out in space. That was to occur on the astronauts' 97th revolution of the earth since their nighttime launching early Tuesday at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida."

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced that it would award a three-year contract to the team headed by Lockheed Space Operations of Titusville, Fla., to perform shuttle services at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California."

Over the next six weeks, Mr. Mondale hopes to demonstrate, by winning a series of straw polls and the endorsement of the largest labor organization, that he has a pre-emptive lead with support among influential Democrats. Mr. Glenn's autumn strategy calls for an effort to convert his celebrity as an astronaut into broad-based popular support that will negate Mr. Mondale's advantage among party leaders. And leaders of the other four campaigns are going to be searching for new or more vigorous strategies that will put their candidates within striking distance of Mr. Mondale and Mr. Glenn by the time the first Iowa caucuses, tentatively set for Feb. 27, begin the selection of convention delegates."

In fact, the topics of many of this fall's major movies will be topical indeed, with dramas about an American photojournalist in Nicaragua, a woman lawyer in Israel who falls in love with a Palestinian, a band of anti-nuclear terrorists who hold a group of American officials hostage, a group of veterans who go back to Vietnam to rescue their buddies from a prison camp, and the death of a worker in a nuclear plant. These are hardly laughing matters, so it's just as well that the fall schedule also includes an unusual abundance of comic relief. Chief among the comedies are a Steve Martin movie with a screenplay by Neil Simon, and a remake of an Ernst Lubitsch classic, ''To Be or Not to Be,'' starring Anne Bancroft and Mel Brooks."

And down at the Department of Health and Human Services the first American Hispanic astronaut, Franklin Ramon Chang Diaz, was on hand for one of the half-dozen Hispanic-oriented ceremonies the Administration staged this week."

      "lead_paragraph": "Townspeople here say they cannot recall any comparable rush to climb Mount Ararat, that great volcanic cone that dominates the frontiers of eastern Turkey, Soviet Armenia and Iran. This year the Turkish authorities eased restrictions, and climbing permits were given to a score of groups from the United States, France, West Germany and Japan as well as Turkey. Most foreign visitors to Dogubayazit, the main base for Ararat climbers, were seeking some trace of Noah's ark, which according to tradition came to rest somewhere on the slopes of the Ararat massif after the Great Flood. But there were also scientists, publicists, alpinists and adventuresome youths among those who flocked here this season to climb Mount Ararat, whose peak is 16,945 feet above sea level. All this activity has greatly helped tourism in the area, which has been on the decline since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini came to power in neighboring Iran in 1979."

      "lead_paragraph": "Strength Through Series Erroll McDonald had thought it through. Books by foreign authors that he and others edited for Random House would sell better, he believed, if they were incorporated in a series under the firm's Vintage paperback imprint - partly because people who like one book are apt to try others with the same brand name and partly because booksellers, who realize the benefits of brand-name loyalty, are likely to get behind books that, as a group, can command promotional resources while they are unlikely to support any single nonblockbuster title on a publisher's list. In January, Mr. McDonald wrote a proposal for a new series. This fall it is making its debut. ''Aventura: The Vintage Library of Contemporary World Literature,'' which includes originals and reprints, uses a distinctive cover design: Slender rules box off the author's name, the book's title, contemporary artwork in color and words of praise from critics. At bottom right is a calligraphic capital A, for Aventura; the whole name is spelled out on the spine and back cover beginning with the same capital."

In interviews, the advisers said they were troubled that the political coalition that elected Mr. Reagan in a landslide in 1980 had greatly atrophied. They said that despite the improvement in the President's popularity since last year, they feared he was not getting enough credit for recent improvements in the economy. The advisers said they believed instinctively that Mr. Reagan would win if he decided to seek re-election, but that he had his work cut out for him. ''We can proceed safely only on one assumption - it's going to be a tough race,'' said Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, general chairman of the Republican Party and the man who is expected to become chairman of Mr. Reagan's presumed re-election drive."

Administration officials say the President is being encouraged to announce the new multibillion-dollar project soon and in some dramatic fashion that, in tone and spirit, would be reminiscent of President Kennedy's dramatic call in 1961 to send men to the moon. In this way, according to some White House thinking, the President might neutralize Senator Glenn's ''hero image'' and demonstrate a commitment to maintaining American leadership in space technology. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has lobbied vigorously in recent months to win support for the space station as ''the next logical step'' in the nation's space program."

''And if I'm portrayed badly, the same way, I don't have any idea what impact it will have.'' In any event, Senator Glenn added, ''there's never been a case where a movie like this came out right in the middle of an election period.'' That last remark, as it turns out, is an understatement. As the 193-minute film had its initial private screenings this week, it was clear that no Presidential candidacy has ever had a send-off quite like that afforded Mr. Glenn by this movie."
