Their accomplishments were a testimonial to the ingenuity of NASA -- and a warning of how precarious the nation's space ventures can become when unexpected glitches develop far from the nearest repair shop. The 15-day mission to enlarge the international space station now circling overhead was scheduled to be arduous from the start. The prime tasks were to add a new closet-size ''room'' that will allow new laboratories to be attached on future flights and to move large solar arrays that provide power to the station. Those two tasks alone constituted the most challenging construction job ever undertaken in space."
