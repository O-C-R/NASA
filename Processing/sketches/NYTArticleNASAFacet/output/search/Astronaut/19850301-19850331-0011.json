Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, had been scheduled to be a passenger on the spaceship. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it would combine some features of the mission with those of another flight that had been scheduled for March 22. The combined mission, which will require outfitting the shuttle Discovery for a Canadian communications satellite that was to have flown on next week's journey, may not get off the ground until April. Officials could not say whether Senator Garn would be on that flight, but if precedent is followed, he would."

''Then you sort of catch your time. You have to know and understand the realm of high art and what the boundaries are. Most artists just flounder around and read too many art magazines.'' Cocky, clever, a cultural iconoclast with a sharp nose for the Zeitgeist, Mr. Longo at 32 is one of the most ambitious and versatile animateurs of the present generation. A media-child weaned on television, movies and news magazines, his multichannel skills include drawing, sculpture, performance art, video, film and music (he used to man the guitar in a rock band). His way of catching our ''time'' is by playing back to us the pressures, contradictions and even hopes engendered by its charged mix of cultures - urban, corporate, technological and media - in taut, sometimes powerful icons that he has said ''exist somewhere between movies and monuments.'' Mr. Longo's new installation at the Brooklyn Museum (through May 6) is called ''Temple of Love.'' The six pieces - some older, some especially conceived for the occasion - in this interesting but uneven show trace developments in his work over the last five years, from the early, large-scale black-and-white drawings that first brought him recognition to current three-dimensional ''combines'' of painting, photography and sculptural relief."

      "lead_paragraph": "THE Presidential conferences that Hofstra University has sponsored annually since 1982 are designed to offer scholarly assessments of the careers and programs of the men who held office. They are not, insists Dr. Paul F. Harper, chairman of the university's political science department, meant to memorialize, celebrate or honor. So when scholars, politicians and journalists gather on the Hempstead campus on Thursday for the fourth conference, ''John F. Kennedy: The Promise Revisited,'' they will come, Dr. Harper said, not merely to praise the New Frontier, but to explore it objectively. ''Of course, we can't avoid some of the commemorative aspects,'' said Dr. Harper, director of the three-day conference. ''Especially, for example, when we bring together members of his staff for a panel discussion. I'm sure that will be filled with reminiscing about the good old days."

      "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: ''Good Old Federalism'' (editorial, Feb. 21) describes the Supreme Court's recent overruling of League of Cities v. Usery as a ''welcome return to sensible federalism.'' It marks, rather, the end of federalism as a notion with any support in the Constitution. The basis for your optimism - and of Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun's majority opinion - is that the values implicit in a Federal system do not need constitutional support because they are amply protected by the political system. That was, in fact, the thesis of an article by Prof. Herbert Wechsler of the Columbia law faculty in 1954 titled ''The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government.'' But 1985 is not 1954; much has happened since then to erode the political foundations of federalism."
