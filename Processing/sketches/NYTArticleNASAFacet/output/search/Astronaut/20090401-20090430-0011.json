He was born in England but is a NASA astronaut who was the pilot of the STS-123 Endeavour shuttle trip to the International Space Station in March 2008. A keen bridge player, he took a spade ace with him for the 6.6-million-mile voyage. (NASA permits astronauts only 10 personal items, and a deck is considered to be 52.) At the Houston event Johnson presented the card and a certificate of authenticity to Jay Baum, the chief executive of the American Contract Bridge League, and Jerry Fleming, this year's league president."

To say that he was excited would be an understatement. As an astronaut, Dr. Grunsfeld had twice journeyed to space to make repairs on humanity's most vaunted eye on the cosmos, experiences he had described to a high-level panel pondering Hubble's fate only a few months before as the most meaningful in his life. He was looking forward to leading the third and final servicing mission, which had been delayed by the loss of the shuttle Columbia and its crew the year before."
