But early this morning, workers began loading more than 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuel into the shuttle's external tanks."

G. Ballard spring to mind -- whose works transcend national and genre boundaries and deserve to be known by readers who would not ordinarily pick up a book labeled science fiction. Mr. Turner's 1988 novel \"Drowning Towers\" was a grim yet paradoxically heartening vision of survival in a world threatened by global warming. The theme of \"Brain Child\" is simply stated: Frankenstein brought up to date. In the first decade of the 21st century, scientists tinkering with the human genome create three groups of mutant clones whose mental abilities are demonstrably superior to those of normal Homo sapiens; in fact, no one knows exactly what their limits are."
