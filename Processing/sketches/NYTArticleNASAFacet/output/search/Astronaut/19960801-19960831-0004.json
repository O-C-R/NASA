Venus Williams drops in just five weeks out of the year -- with her braces, her beads and her books -- eager to test-drive the women's tennis tour. This particular week, she got the Maserati (Steffi Graf), but somehow never had to assume the crash position. Her father, Richard Williams, touted the match as No. 1 in the world versus No. 1 in ''the ghetto,'' but the real oddity was that Venus had the longer legs of the two. Williams is a centimeter under 6 feet, is 16 years 2 months old and expected victory. Instead, the elegant Graf won Wednesday's third-round match at the Acura Classic in 81 minutes -- 6-4, 6-4 -- but imagine if Williams had stopped hitting waist-high to Graf's forehand."

For months, the Academy Award-winning actor had just about committed himself to making what is expected to be a high-profile and expensive film from the best-selling novel. The book was based on the 1992 Clinton Presidential campaign and rang true enough, at least in spots, that insiders assumed that only another insider could have written it. Mike Nichols owns film rights to the novel and is to direct and produce, with a screenplay by Elaine May. Universal signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Mr. Nichols after the film had more or less been shopped around as a Nichols-Hanks project."
