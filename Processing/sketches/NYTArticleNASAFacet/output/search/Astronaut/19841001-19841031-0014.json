The three, Leonid Kizim, Vladimir Solovyov and Oleg Atkov, returned to the earth at 1:57 P.M., Moscow time, after spending 237 days in space, Tass said. The Soviet evening television news program showed their capsule wafting down under a red and white parachute, then a quick puff of fire and smoke as the craft's soft-landing engines fired."

Since few Long Islanders have farms to leave ungleaned, a group from the Melville-Dix Hills area is doing what the members consider the next best thing: They are going out into the fields themselves to glean for the poor. Sponsored by the Social Action Committee of Temple Beth Torah in Dix Hills, the group includes members of that congregation, of the Honor Society at Burr's Lane Junior High School, also in Dix Hills, and parishioners of King of Kings Lutheran Church in Melville. Several hundred people are expected to participate in today's gleaning project. They will wander into the fields, actually Meyer's Farm Stand, and, in the shadow of the Long Island Expressway, fill bushel baskets with string beans, tomatoes and green peppers hand-picked from the vines. The produce will then be donated to the Long Island Regional Food Bank for distribution to several day care facilities and centers for the elderly as well as emergency food pantries."

Landings in Florida - this was only the second in 13 flights - rather than in California eliminate the need to bring the shuttle back to Cape Canaveral and are seen as necessary to keep the shuttle on a once-a-month schedule."

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a preliminary look following Saturday's perfect landing here showed that the shuttle had received some minor nicks on a few of its thermal tiles, which protect the craft from the heat of re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The space agency also said a strip of insulating tile was missing from the tail area. Engineers believe it was ripped away in the liftoff."

Political experts, backed by a range of published polls, indicate that Mr. Reagan holds a lead in almost every Middle Western state despite a chronic economic malaise that has struck both aging industries and beleaguered farms. According to one newspaper survey, Mr. Reagan even seems ahead of Walter F. Mondale in Mr. Mondale's home state, Minnesota. In what are regarded as the area's two closest races, those for Senate seats in Illinois and Iowa, the Republican incumbents, Senators Charles H. Percy and Roger W. Jepsen, have closely allied themselves with the Reagan Administration and appear to be counting on riding the President's coattails: He spent much of his early life in both states. Both races are considered crucial to Republican hopes of retaining control of the Senate, which now has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats."

Lousma, Michigan's Republican nominee for the Senate, began campaigning against Senator Carl Levin, the Democratic incumbent, Republican strategists hoped he could capitalize on his career as an astronaut and on President Reagan's apparent popularity among union members. But less than a month before the election, Mr. Lousma's attacks on big government, high taxes and Mr. Levin's voting record do not appear to have caught on. Statewide polls indicate he is trailing Senator Levin, who in his six years in Washington has been a critic of the B-1 bomber, the MX missile system and high costs for spare parts of weapons. Last month, for example, in a poll by The Detroit News, Senator Levin was leading Mr. Lousma by 40 percentage points, 62 percent to 22 percent. In addition, 48 percent of those questioned said they did not know enough about the Republican candidate to make a decision."

But East and West meet finally across the dinner table in this understated tale about the courtship of a Japanese schoolgirl and an American sailor whom she meets while he is stationed in Yokohama."

President Reagan announced in August that an elementary or high school teacher would be the first ''citizen passenger'' to fly into space aboard the space shuttle, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is to begin accepting applications Dec. 1, an agency official told the educators at the space camp. Dream 'Might Come True' Michael A. DiSpezio, a high school science teacher from Cataumet, Mass., said the knowledge he gained in three days here at the Alabama Space and Rocket Center's space camp and museum would help him stand out from the thousands of teachers who are expected to apply for a shuttle ride. ''I know they say 80,000 may apply,'' Mr. DiSpezio said, but ''with what I've experienced this weekend I feel like my dream just might come true.''"

Congress has unanimously passed a resolution, now awaiting President Reagan's approval or rejection, that would commit the country to seek cooperation in a broad range of space activities with the Soviet Union, ranging from joint space rescue programs to manned exploration of the solar system. Today, at a symposium on long- range proposals to build a permanent base on the moon, Government and private speakers portrayed space as the last and best hope for achieving peace between adversarial nations. James M. Beggs, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the sponsor of the three-day symposium, said that a manned lunar base ''would be an enormous challenge'' requiring new technologies and large economic resources, all of which implied, he said, the need for ''international sharing of risks and benefits.''"
