Next week's planned voyage of the shuttle Endeavour is almost a mirror image of an October mission that added a large support beam to the station. The Endeavour, carrying seven American and Russian astronauts, is scheduled to blast off on Monday morning from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on an 11-day mission. The shuttle will carry another 28,000-pound truss segment to expand the space station and a new crew of three to take over operations at the station for the next four months."

      "lead_paragraph": "The scholar's career path does not necessarily lead to academia. Take David Duchovny, who was sidetracked by the acting bug and never completed his dissertation at Yale, ''Magic and Technology in Contemporary American Fiction and Poetry.'' In fact, he would fib about the extent of his schooling, ''for the silly reason that people would become intimidated by a worthless pedigree and diploma,'' Mr. Duchovny said back when his ''X-Files'' character, Fox Mulder, made him a star. Mr. Duchovny may be the most overeducated actor in Hollywood, but lots of unlikely Ph.D.'s have found success in the real world. Jack T. Ramsay After 11 years coaching at his alma mater, St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, and a pro coaching record that led to induction in the Basketball Hall of Fame, Dr. Ramsay thought his doctorate in education would ease his way into administration as a dean or even a college president. But while his career on the bench ended with the Indiana Pacers in 1988, he has yet to leave courtside and now spins N.B.A. analysis for ESPN. Dr. Ramsay thinks his research for his Ph.D., awarded in 1963 by the University of Pennsylvania, proved an assist in making him a better coach. His dissertation found that, with few exceptions, students recruited by St. Joseph's for athletic ability developed into more well-rounded individuals and rose to the academic level of the student body. The study also deepened his appreciation of coaching. ''Coaching is the embodiment of everything -- physical, psychological, creative, competitive,'' he says. ''To put your team up against those with more talent, to keep your poise when everything is turning to ashes. It's very all-absorbing.''"

The first special children's books issue appeared in the fall of 1947. In 1952, just after the first baby boomers went off to kindergarten, the Book Review convened a special art jury -- representatives of the education departments of the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum, and the art department of the paper -- to look at 100 books culled from some 500 published that year. The jury chose and ranked seven, beginning with ''The Magic Currant Bun,'' by André François, and ending with ''A Hole Is to Dig,'' illustrated by Maurice Sendak. Ranked No. 5 was ''The Animal Fair,'' by Alice and Martin Provensen."

Like most 4-year-old boys, Sam loves things that move -- trains, planes and trucks, especially fire trucks -- and is usually on the move himself. When he enters a room, his clear blue eyes dart about, as though he cannot take in the sights fast enough. His knees and elbows are perpetually scraped. When his teachers read stories aloud, Sam often wanders about."
