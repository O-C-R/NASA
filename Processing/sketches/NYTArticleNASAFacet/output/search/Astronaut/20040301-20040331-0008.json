      "lead_paragraph": "What a difference a few months makes. Last July, John Grunsfeld, an astronaut, waxed enthusiastic about the value and sheer pleasure of participating in servicing missions to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope, one of the most productive scientific instruments of all time. In testimony prepared for an expert panel, Mr. Grunsfeld called Hubble missions ''highly coveted assignments'' and said his own two Hubble flights had been the most important achievement in his life. Despite the tragic loss of the space shuttle Columbia, he said, he judged Hubble missions as little more risky than other shuttle flights. ''I can say without hesitation that traveling to space to upgrade the instruments and ensure the future of the Hubble Space Telescope was worth the potential risk to my life,'' he testified. Then came new requirements to enhance safety after the Columbia accident, followed by President Bush's expansive plan to send astronauts to the Moon and Mars in distant years. That plan requires maximum use of the shuttles to complete the international space station, relegating Hubble to the status of an inconvenient diversion."
