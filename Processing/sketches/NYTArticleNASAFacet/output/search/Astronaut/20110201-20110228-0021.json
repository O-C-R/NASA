''The Last Detail'' (1973) is broadcast at 2:15, in which he stars as Buddusky, a Navy lifer who, with his fellow escort (Otis Young), decides to show a young prisoner (Randy Quaid) a good time on his way to the brig. 9 A.M.

With a group of friends and family members acting as a backup chorus, Ms. Giffords has been mouthing the lyrics to ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' and ''I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby.'' And as a surprise for her husband, who is celebrating his birthday this month, a longtime friend who has been helping her through her rehabilitation videotaped her mouthing the words to ''Happy Birthday to You.''"

My soccer team, Maccabi Petah Tikva, played Ashdod earlier today, and I surf over to Israel's largest news portal to check the score. On the home page, above the headline reporting Petah Tikva's solid 3-1 victory, the following item appears: ''Palestinian killed in Samaria yesterday. Watch video footage.'' I click on the link. It's not every day that someone offers you the chance to watch a documented killing. The next page says that cameras at an Israeli observation post caught on video a settler shooting a young Palestinian man, after the Palestinian chased him and threw rocks at him. ''Watch the clip.''"

The countdown proceeded smoothly into its final hour, but trouble with an Air Force tracking system computer threw the outcome into doubt. With the countdown holding at the five-minute mark, the Air Force reported a successful repair. The countdown resumed, and Discovery blasted off at 4:53:24 p.m. Eastern time -- three seconds before the end of the day's launching window."
