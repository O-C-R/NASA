Early today they put the finishing touches on the first round of work to make it a more scientifically meaningful life through new optics to correct the telescope's blurred view of the universe. In a space walk of more than six hours late Sunday and early Monday, two astronauts replaced the Hubble's two solar-power panels, one of which was warped and twisted, with an improved set to eliminate the vibrations that had upset many of the telescope's observations. The work went without a hitch, and initial tests indicated that the arrays of electricity-producing cells functioned normally."

But the strong, handsome test pilot soared one place no chimp will every go: into the pantheon of American heros. Ticker tape rained down. The door to the Senate creaked open. Tom Wolfe determined that he possessed \"The Right Stuff.\" Wendy Lawrence, daughter of a test pilot who trained with the first astronauts, was 2 years old in 1962 when Mr. Glenn first orbited the earth. After the Naval Academy, helicopter flight training, and a master's in oceanography from M.I.T., Lieut. Commdr. Lawrence joined the astronaut corps a year ago."

Goldin is the kind of person who can get comfortable in a crowded restaurant of booths and counters, of gruff waitresses and $2.50 cheeseburgers. While in New York on business, he downs a burger, fries and milkshake while recounting the challenges of heading the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Federal Government's largest scientific agency, a faded star whose luster he is trying to restore. His dark business suit, softened by wire-rim glasses and a battered leather briefcase, somehow fits the restaurant's decor and lunch-hour din. Suddenly his face brightens. He leans forward in a confidential manner. Did you know, he asks, his voice dead serious, about the 15th-century Portuguese navigator who learned to catch prevailing winds halfway across the Atlantic toward Brazil before coming about and heading east, thus avoiding the doldrums and creating an indirect route to Africa that turned out to be much faster?"
