Stockman, who has been designated President-elect Ronald Reagan's budget chief, answered a Senate committee's questions for more than five hours today in a confirmation hearing that produced harbingers of conflicts over cutting the budget. Representative Stockman, a Michigan Republican, acknowledged that there would be opposition from various quarters when the new administration became specific about applying Mr. Reagan's campaign pledge to eliminate ''waste, fraud and abuse.'' He told the Governmental Affairs Committee that there was no budget line labeled ''waste, fraud and abuse.'' ''They have other names and those names have constituencies,'' Mr. Stockman said."

William Domhoff, wrote in ''The Bohemian Grove and Other Retreats,'' published by Harper & Row in 1973. ''They include in their numbers directors from major corporations in every sector of the American economy.'' Former President Richard M. Nixon was a member, and perhaps still is; membership lists are confidential. Herbert Hoover, who called it ''the greatest men's party on earth,'' was a longtime member, as is former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Sr. Mr. Brown's son, the current Governor, never joined."

      "lead_paragraph": "Jolted by last year's recession and burdened by debt, Eastern Air Lines Inc. has been staggered further by powerful competition from other lines. Under Frank Borman, its ex-astronaut president, chairman and chief executive, Eastern itself has been competing vigorously: last year it announced low fares to gain passengers in the New York-toCalifornia market -and spurred a price war. This month it has moved to protect its Air Shuttle and generate transcontinental business by giving shuttle passengers coupons good for flights to California at half price. And Eastern is considering a merger with debt-ridden Braniff International, which could give it a leg up on Latin American routes, where Braniff has been strong. But Eastern's overall performance has been ''disappointing,'' Mr. Borman conceded, solemn-faced, in an interview yesterday. For the first nine months of 1980, the airline lost $35 million, compared with earnings of $42 million in the 1979 period. The red ink included an operating loss of $5 million, on operating revenues of $2.56 billion, and reflected the heavy cost of financing equipment. Some analysts predict that Eastern's 1980 loss will exceed $50 million, compared with a 1979 net of $57.6 million."

Anyone watching these programs is probably doing other things as well; this is the time of day when the audience is least likely to be sitting still. So, television, which in the evening can hope to hold the viewer's full attention, must settle in the morning for a fleeting, collaborative role. The best it can do, along with the toaster and the coffeepot, is help send you on your way. What can television ideally offer when it exerts only a partial influence? Conciseness is the key to programming on both ''Good Morning America'' and ''Today,'' which run from 7 A.M. to 9 A.M. and consist of quick, compact segments on a variety of topics. Health, finance, child-rearing, home improvement, consumer news - any one of these subjects can lend itself to a five-minute spot that's over before you burn breakfast, giving way quickly to another snippet of comparable interest. Short segments like these are most effective when they provide enough information to pique one's curiosity but not too much to bog down. At this time of day, speed and economy are everything. Morning television works most efficiently when it delivers only as much detail as the busy, distracted viewer can handle and no more."
