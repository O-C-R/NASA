As a veteran high school counselor, I know what lies ahead for him, the pressures he and those who teach him will face. As a rookie parent, I can't help wonder what the hours at school are like for him -- whether he enjoys them, whether he has friends, even what he's thinking and learning. If I ask him, ''How was school?'' I get the standard reflexive reply, ''O.K.'' If I try again, wording the question more craftily to get beyond a one-word answer, I may get a sentence, and then, it's not always complete. I am resigned to the fact Ryan will let me know what I need to know on his terms and when he is ready."

James D. Halsell Jr. of the Air Force."

They said the finding was significant, but they did not know what it meant. Experts say they believe that the left wing was opened up to superheated gases, probably at the leading edge, as the shuttle tried to return to earth on Feb. 1. Their operative theory is that the cause of the breach was a strike by debris on liftoff. But nine weeks into the investigation, they say they are still uncertain about the chain of events, and new findings like the one today about the reinforced carbon-carbon wing panels merely added to the mystery."

Few people focused on its skeleton, made of a much more familiar material -- lightweight, inexpensive aluminum. Now, in hindsight, investigators are postulating whether the aluminum played a central role in Columbia's destruction. When the shuttle's thermal protection system began to fail, the aluminum skeleton was unforgiving. It not only melted, but burned."
