This weekend, as NASA still struggles to understand the silence from Mars where the Mars Polar Lander was scheduled to touch down on Friday, the space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to blast off on a mission to restore the observatory. The telescope has been shut down since Nov. 13, when its precision pointing system failed and the observatory went dormant."

The point is usually that when they traveled (''Oh, heavens, this was years ago . . .''), it was absolutely marvelous, and too bad you weren't traveling then. But this is largely boastful bunk, and misses the point, for travel is the opposite of a holiday. It is about enlightenment and, at its best, is a form of disappearance. As recently as 40 years ago, a person could evaporate by traveling; even a trip to Europe involved a sort of obscurity. A trip to Africa or South America was a vanishing into silence. In a connected world, it is not so easy to get lost, and this is probably to our detriment."

Fourteen years of research taught him otherwise. To be precise, the Mercury space capsule he sought, not much larger than a refrigerator, was in the Atlantic, 300 miles off the Florida coast. To be even more precise, it lay in the three-by-eight-mile patch of water plotted by Mr. Newport. To be absolutely precise, it was exactly the sonar ping he thought it was, 15,600 feet down. An object as prominent as the second vehicle an American rode into space ordinarily might be found front and center in an air and space museum. As recounted in the documentary ''In Search of Liberty Bell 7,'' tonight at 9 on the Discovery Channel, this particular piece of history spent 38 years on the bottom, waiting for the technology that could reach it at that depth."

The ''disgrace'' of the title belongs to the central character of this novel (winner of this year's Booker Prize in Britain), a Cape Town intellectual whose sexual sin, later visited on his daughter, is made to reflect the old guilt of white privilege. DOUBLE DOWN: Reflections on Gambling and Loss, by Frederick Barthelme and Steven Barthelme. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Two brothers, both writers of distinguished fiction, tell how they lost more than $300,000 and managed to be indicted for cheating as well. EDWARD M. KENNEDY: A Biography, by Adam Clymer. (Morrow, $27.50.) A thorough, careful account of the growth of a senator who has earned more respect than seemed likely in his youth; by the chief Washington correspondent of The Times. HOMESICKNESS, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper, $14.) An Australian novel that cogitates on the dubious pleasures of mass tourism as a group of 13 follows a senseless itinerary through surreal and baffling museums. THE LONG HOME, by William Gay. (MacMurray & Beck, $24.95.) This first novelist fears no theme, however large; it's good versus evil in Faulkner territory, and good succeeds only when it's better armed than evil and willing to exert violence. LOSING NELSON, by Barry Unsworth. (Doubleday, $23.95.) A provocative, absorbing novel whose mad hero hides from his own life by his elaborate identification with Admiral Nelson, a folly he understands well enough to labor at the same time to destroy it. THE NEW SWEET STYLE, by Vassily Aksyonov. (Random House, $29.95.) A luscious Russian novel with a love story at its heart, surrounded by picaresque events in America and demanding, the author insists, frequent help from the reader. SILENT STARS, by Jeanine Basinger. (Knopf, $35.) A film historian argues that many of the stars of the silents, especially Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, wielded talent and cultural scope that have been forgotten as the films themselves were forgotten, lost or just unseen. THE WALKING TOUR, by Kathryn Davis. (Houghton Mifflin, $23.) A brilliantly dexterous novel that manages to contain a 20th-century murder mystery, told in a post-global-disaster future by one victim's daughter. (The other victim was somehow responsible for the disaster.) WALTER BENJAMIN AT THE DAIRY QUEEN: Reflections at Sixty and Beyond, by Larry McMurtry. (Simon & Schuster, $21.) A peculiar book, part memoir, part tour de force, part commonplace book, in which the author of ''Lonesome Dove'' regrets what he thinks is his failure to subvert fallacies about the Old West."

Well, those days are gone. There are no more primitives. Or rather, we are all primitives. Modern people wear hockey masks, gas masks and surgical masks. You could say that modern masks are just for protection. You could also say that hockey, war and surgery are rituals and that these masks reveal something about the relationships of the people who wear them."

(Viking, $23.95.) The ''disgrace'' of the title belongs to the central character of this novel (winner of this year's Booker Prize in Britain), a Cape Town intellectual whose sexual sin, later visited on his daughter, is made to reflect the old guilt of white privilege. DOUBLE DOWN: Reflections on Gambling and Loss, by Frederick Barthelme and Steven Barthelme. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Two brothers, both writers of distinguished fiction, tell how they managed to lose more than $300,000. EMPIRE EXPRESS: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad, by David Haward Bain. (Viking, $34.95.) An authoritative, engaging history of the gigantic enterprise that linked the coasts of America in 1869, and of the robber barons and immigrant workers who did it. THE GOODLIFE, by Keith Scribner. (Riverhead, $23.95.) A novel that ponders why crime stories so fascinate us while telling a hair-raising tale of a kidnap gone wrong, using five narrative points of view without ever getting confused or woozy. MAILER: A Biography, by Mary V. Dearborn. (Houghton Mifflin, $30.) Norman Mailer carefully examined from without (no interviews) by a writer who appreciates the equal importance of his life and his work in understanding America in the second half of the 20th century. OSBERT SITWELL, by Philip Ziegler. (Knopf, $30.) An elegant, expertly written life of Sir Osbert Sitwell, an ineffable aristocrat with a temporary literary reputation and a permanent conviction that he, his sister Edith and his brother Sacheverell were made of superior clay. REMBRANDT'S EYES, by Simon Schama. (Knopf, $50.) A huge, digressive, learned, personal, often fascinating book defending Rembrandt's genius, as if it needed defending. SIAM: Or, The Woman Who Shot a Man, by Lily Tuck. (Sewanee Writers' Series/Overlook, $23.95.) An intelligent, sparely written, politically preoccupied novel in which a young American wife in Thailand during the Vietnam War suffers first confusion, then obsession, then tragedy. THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE: Picasso, Provence, and Douglas Cooper, by John Richardson. (Knopf, $26.95.) Picasso's biographer takes time out to give an account of his own early life and his relationship with the rich and prickly art historian and collector Douglas Cooper. WALTER BENJAMIN AT THE DAIRY QUEEN: Reflections at Sixty and Beyond, by Larry McMurtry. (Simon & Schuster, $21.) A peculiar book, part memoir, part tour de force, part commonplace book, in which the author of ''Lonesome Dove'' regrets what he thinks is his failure to subvert fallacies about the Old West."
