The others that I reported on achieved their goals with impressive regularity, but the memorable three stirred especially deep emotions. Apollo 8 came as a refreshing surprise to a beleaguered nation at the end of 1968, a year of assassinations, burning streets and inflamed political passions. This was the first time men had gone so far out in space, and the destination was visible to all. Astronauts circled the Moon 10 times, each time disappearing from radio contact. It was a mission that held the world -- and us reporters at Mission Control in Houston -- in thrall. For me the story had everything: science fiction coming to life, complete with hardware; man's lofty aspirations; nasty global politics, and a race with a feared adversary."

Most of the astronaut films from the 60's through the 80's, like \"Capricorn One,\" \"Marooned,\" \"Countdown\" and, of course, \"The Right Stuff,\" now seem like historical costume dramas. Playing the chief of manned space in \"Marooned\" (1969), Gregory Peck makes his big speech: \"The trip to the Moon was just a walk around the block. We're going to the stars, to other worlds . . . \" But of course we're not. Less than 30 years ago we leaned into the cosmos and then quickly pulled our heads back through the window. The budget of an already unadventurous National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been slashed, and the shuttle does no more than spin its orbital wheels. Space movies remind us of our own downsized dreams. It's not the pictures that got small; it's us."

It dramatized the fates, fortunes and futures of the powerful: the King of Pop, the only daughter of the once and future King of Rock-and-Roll, and the reigning queen of that vast television realm in which one is simultaneously journalist and hostess, dissenter, sycophant and star. The fate of Michael Jackson's career hung in the balance, we were led to believe. So did the fortunes of ABC and Sony Records and, it seemed, the future of a marriage of unparalleled psychosexual, sociological and financial complexity. Media critics like to say that television makes passive drones of us all. But not this time; we were as important to the drama as any Greek chorus. We were active commentators and spectators, gossiping, interpreting, judging, knowing that our opinions mattered at least as much as the facts and fictions uttered by the on-screen performers."

The docking is set for early Thursday and will kick off five days of joint research by 10 astronauts in a sprawling orbital complex made up of the 112-foot-long Mir and the 122-foot-long shuttle. A winged American spaceship has never before docked with a Russian craft."

The space shuttle Atlantis is to dock with the Russian space station Mir about 9 A.M., hooking up a pressurized tunnel through which astronauts can float in shirt-sleeves. If successfully joined, the two craft will form a structure bigger and brighter than any other to probe the heavens in the 38 years since the space age began."

It's a small but important change, one more way that \"Apollo 13\" unfolds with perfect immediacy, drawing viewers into the nail-biting suspense of a spellbinding true story. You can know every glitch that made this such a dangerous mission, and \"Apollo 13\" will still have you by the throat. Better even than Mr. Howard's sure hand with this fascinating material is his film's unexpected restraint. \"Apollo 13\" understands the difference between movie bravado and real courage, and it celebrates the latter in inspiring ways that have almost gone out of style. With Tom Hanks, wonderful again, as the Everyman in the driver's seat, \"Apollo 13\" isn't afraid of the stone-cold fear at the heart of this tale or of the intricate group effort needed to see it through. This film and its brave, believable characters are uplifting in ways that have nothing to do with a voyage to outer space."
