In a time of rampant, profit-driven standardization, one of the most enduring trends in art of the past half-century has been work that looks as if it were made by a person with an offbeat mind uncontaminated by conventional wisdom. Like Tom Hanks, you don't have to be a psychological innocent actually to play the Outsider. Lots of well-educated professionals produce seemingly self-taught art, and it is that kind of thing that makes up ''Underground Pop'' at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, N.Y. It's an entertaining if not revelatory exhibition of funky, mostly handmade works by 10 artists."
