He also concedes that the film \"took the rough edges off the character,\" earthy and exuberantly profane in the book, and that several layers of sentiment were brushed on, like sticky varnish. But that's O.K., too. Actually, Mr. Groom has only one tiny complaint, and that's directed at the hundreds of thousands of readers who are picking up his 1986 novel for the first time. \"Where were you eight years ago?\" he asked over a drink at the Rainbow Room in Manhattan on Tuesday. \"It's the same damn book.\""

      "lead_paragraph": "In a high-stakes confrontation not seen in years between two air carriers, United Airlines is about to battle Southwest Airlines for the skies of the West, a face-off that will help shape the future of each company and of the domestic airline industry. While other carriers like America West and Alaska Airlines will be caught up in the battle, it is the contest starting on Oct. 1 between the new Shuttle by United, run by the nation's largest airline, and Southwest, a smaller but perennially profitable and influential carrier, that will be watched by other airlines and travel-industry experts nationwide."
