But critics, citing internal agency documents and NASA's own acknowledgment that it has not made all the improvements it committed to, contend that the agency is rushing back to the unforgiving environment of space with too much of the job left undone."

      "lead_paragraph": "NIKKI SIXX, the bassist for the famously fast-living glam-rockers Motley Crue, believes that even 24 years after their debut, his band still has a certain timeless aspect. ''If you want to drop the tailgate, get some beer and go to a strip club, that's the Crue,'' he said the other day before a rehearsal for the band's new tour. Yet Mr. Sixx's band, which just released a two-disc career anthology including 1987's ''Girls, Girls, Girls'' and 1989's ''Dr. Feelgood,'' is returning at a particularly apt moment. The music of the 1980's has re-entered the zeitgeist in a gigantic way. What began more than a decade ago with 80's nightclubs spread soon after through ''flashback'' lunch hours across the radio dial. After that came the retro-tinged success of blockbuster films like ''The Wedding Singer'' and pastel-saturated video games like ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.'' On television, the hits of that decade now fill the soundtracks of countless popular series, like ''The O.C.,'' which chose a cover of the OMD hit ''If You Leave'' for a decisive scene last season. And VH1, of course, has built a franchise on 80's exhumations, with ''Big 80's'' and the wildly popular ''I Love the 80's.'' All together, it's proof that the synthesizer-powered pop songs and hair-sprayed headbangers of that era still have a strange hold on the 30-something demographic so desirable to advertisers."

The Rick Springfields of the world can rise and fall, but MTV endures. And though its overall aesthetic has changed many times over the years, MTV has always put a premium on a visual style with a graphic twist: still photography and video, combined with animation, collage and illustrated words. MTV Networks now consists of 100 channels around the world -- Comedy Central, VH1, CMT and Nickelodeon, among others -- and each has a design that is fundamental to attracting its desired audience, whether savvy fans of pop culture or 9-year-old admirers of Sponge Bob Squarepants. The most recent project -- and one of the most visible ever -- is the new logo for MTV2. Meant to introduce a faster-paced format, to court a young, male audience and in response to the music network Fuse, the image of the two-headed dog (above) was plastered all over New York City in a street marketing campaign that began in mid-January. MTV2 switched to its new logo -- and new programming -- at midnight on Feb. 7."
