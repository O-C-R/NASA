      "lead_paragraph": "In his State of the State Message yesterday, Gov. George Pataki painted a sunny picture of a New York where jobs are growing, taxes are plummeting and government is shrinking to everyone's advantage. He linked his war against wasteful government to the fall of the Berlin wall and \"freedom's victory over Fascism.\" Mr. Pataki was overselling his point. Perhaps more important, his less-is-more description of New York's future glossed over the pain and problems that lie ahead. The state faces what Mr. Pataki has described as a $4 billion shortfall between revenues and projected expenditures in its budget for 1996-1997. Given that neither he nor the Legislature seems inclined in this election year to defer an income tax cut promised by the Governor, the shortfall will have to be closed by a reduction in government services, Medicaid, welfare and aid to education."

The high-school teacher from Concord, N. H., who climbed aboard the space shuttle Challenger at Cape Canaveral on the cold morning of Jan. 28, 1986, hoped to share what she called \"the ultimate field trip\" with the nation's children, instructing them on the wonders of weightlessness and the riddles of the starry unknown. She seemed to symbolize a first step in demystifying space travel and opening the experience to all people. But she was not the first. Since Americans began blasting into space 35 years ago, the definition of what it takes to be an astronaut has gone through slow cycles of change, not unlike fashion. There have been times when NASA favored the idea that only the macho could be astronauts and times when it favored the idea that anyone could be. After the Challenger disaster, NASA dropped the democratic ideal of space travel. But now, realistically or not, NASA is starting to talk once again about sending new generations of neophytes into orbit, including tourists."

Without a doubt, experts agree, though NASA says the likelihood of catastrophe is less today than on that icy morning a decade ago when the space shuttle Challenger, 73 seconds into its flight, erupted in a ball of flame, killing seven people. Like the owner of a costly but temperamental car who keeps trying to make do, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has invested more than $5 billion since the accident to rebuild the nation's fleet of winged spaceships and enhance the safety of hundreds of parts and systems, including the flawed engine and its leaky seal that doomed Challenger. And it has successfully flown 49 shuttle missions since then, no small accomplishment."
