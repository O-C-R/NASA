      "lead_paragraph": "LOS ANGELES Like the architects of the space program itself, the creators of the 13-hour, $30 million mini-series called ''Space'' have had imposing logistical problems to solve before blast-off. Adapted from James Michener's best-selling novel, one of the author's typically sweeping sagas, ''Space'' is nothing less than a chronicle of the first three decades of the space program in America. To translate Mr. Michener's epic tale to television, a great many people have had to pool their resources. Two directors (Joseph Sargent and Lee Phillips) split the chores of supervising the mammoth production; two writers (Sterling Silliphant and the show's executive producer, Dick Berg) spent more than a year adapting the sprawling story into a screenplay and still had to do an inordinate amount of rewriting throughout production; the cast and crew traveled to several far-flung locations, from the English countryside to the Space Center in Houston and the beaches of Cape Canaveral; and a special-effects team worked to simulate space walks and moon landings. The effort is not yet completed; an army of editors is currently fine-tuning all five parts of ''Space'' in preparation for broadcast on CBS-TV in April. The stars of the mini-series include James Garner, Blair Brown, Bruce Dern, Susan Anspach, Michael York, Harry Hamlin and Beau Bridges."

Twelve years after the last Apollo astronauts walked on its barren surface, scientists, astronauts, engineers and space agency officials are calling for a return to the scene of the American space program's early glories. They are talking of establishing observatories able to penetrate the mysteries of the universe with far more power than the space telescope to be launched in 1986. They are drafting routes for manned expeditions across wide stretches of the lunar landscape. They envision setting up permanent bases on the moon, not only to support such ventures but as stepping stones to more distant goals. Lunar bases could, for example, provide materials needed to build extraterrestrial colonies. By enriching the soil with nitrogen, lunar stations might be able to grow their own food."

It orbited the earth once, glided back into the atmosphere and splashed down in the Black Sea like a bottom-heavy speedboat. The apparently successful unmanned flight, the fourth in an ambitious new shuttle program, was seen as further evidence of the growing superpower competition to develop advanced instruments for using space for military as well as peaceful operations. Tass, the Soviet press agency, announced the flight only after the mission was completed, in the obscure language it uses to describe most Soviet space activities, even civilian ones. But yesterday's flight was treated by the Russians as a military exercise requiring especially stringent secrecy."

F. Kluge. (Freundlich Books, $15.95.) ''Season for War'' is a historical novel about 200 black soldiers who remain in the military after the Civil War. These ''buffalo soldiers'' - so called by newspaper reporters of the 1880's because of ''their bison-like carriage'' - go west to the Arizona Territory. They fight and eventually defeat the Apache nation and then herd the Indians to a reservation in Florida. Later they drift to Manila and Samar, where they fight Filipinos in the Spanish-American War. The plot that girds this action, however, involves three white Hoosiers who become involved in a love triangle. There is Henry Lawson, the rugged captain who leads the black soldiers, a war hero who has the sophistication of a boy playing king of the mountain; Edwin Carter Morrison, a war correspondent for The New York Sun whose stories have made this foolish captain into a hero; and Lucy Lawson, Henry's wife as well as Edwin's lover, a kind of kitsch Lady Macbeth who throws dinner parties on the prairie while urging the two men to promote their careers. But since P. J. Kluge's real concerns seem to be the victims of American imperialism at the close of the 19th century and the part the press played in making America's ''Manifest Destiny'' an accepted myth, these three characters for the most part emerge as merely representations of the silly, macho hero, the sensational, dishonest journalist and the repressed wife."

Risks taken by women, barriers broken, victories savored, political defeats suffered, were never more visible than in 1984. ''Just seeing those faces on television was a tremendous high,'' said JoAnne Finney, a Brooklyn radiologist, speaking of Geraldine A. Ferraro, Democratic candidate; Dr. Kathryn D. Sullivan, astronaut; Joan Benoit, winner of the first Olympic women's marathon. ''It felt good to see women taking chances, sweating, really going for it,'' she said, ''whether they won or not.''"
