While it was enjoyable, it did not make any reference to the inequalities in public policy that almost brought the railroads to extinction. I work for the New York State Thruway Authority as an emergency responder on the Tappan Zee Bridge. Every day I see the rat race Americans call commuting. High Occupancy Vehicle lanes lie idle as one-driver cars cram into long lines at EZ Pass and cash toll booths. Impatience, excessive speed and lack of driver attentiveness result in 90 percent of all incidents on the span. Politicians focus their attention on ameliorating conditions by exercising cosmetic changes. The flanged wheel riding atop a steel rail is still the most efficient form of ground transportation."

At the moment of sunset, birds somewhere in the trees broke into song, life sounding retreat at the loss of light. The astronomers turned back to the dome and the telescope within. Time to go to work, time to search the heavens for other stars not unlike the Sun and see whether some of them also have companion worlds -- other places where night follows day, where there might be air and water, mountains and shore, even life and song."

Several years ago, he was trying to come up with an idea for a new show when he happened to talk to his 10-year-old nephew on the phone. The nephew mentioned that he was reading the Hardy Boys, and something clicked in his uncle's head. He recalled that as a youngster he had read every single Hardy Boys book in the school library. He then made a quick trip to a bookstore, where he found that the books were still enormously popular. ''Kids love mysteries,'' he said."
