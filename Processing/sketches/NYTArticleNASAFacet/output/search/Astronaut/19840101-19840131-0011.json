That is when this city rediscovers, yet again, how quickly its conventional wisdom gets outdated. The main attraction of the first week of the 1984 Presidential campaign was supposed to be the sight of Walter F. Mondale lighting the fuse on his campaign rocket. Then came the Rev. Jesse Jackson's successful negotiation for the release of Lieut. Robert O. Goodman Jr. In comparison, Mr. Mondale's liftoff seemed flat and uninspiring. He attained airspeed, but there was no sonic boom."

A.Schemes envisioning the growing of algae or other plants in space to take up carbon dioxide and produce oxygen have been imagined, according to Terry White, a spokesman for NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, but for the foreseeable future air will continue to be supplied by carrying liquid oxygen in superinsulated Dewar containers (much like high-tech thermos bottles) at about minus 420 degrees Fahrenheit. Heavy high-pressure containers like those used for compressed oxygen by hospitals or industries are not required, so the six pounds or so of oxygen that an astronaut requires every day is no tremendous burden on the spacecraft's cargo capacity. A space station, Mr. White says, would periodically be resupplied with oxygen from earth, and even a 500-day Mars mission would probably get by with stored oxygen. Carbon dioxide breathed out by the astronauts would probably be disposed of as it is now, in lithium hydroxide scrubbers that absorb it from the cabin atmosphere."

Releasing its annual report on the ''State of Black America,'' the civil rights organization presented a bleak, strongly worded assessment in which it warned that poor blacks were being relegated to ''an out-of-sight, out- of-mind'' status in American life. ''The state of black America is disastrous,'' John E. Jacob, the league president, said in making the report public. ''While white Americans celebrate a long-overdue economic recovery and a falling unemployment rate, black America is buried in a depression of crushing proportions. The plain ugly fact is that there is no recovery for black Americans.''"

Mondale and other candidates in evoking a fear that present national policies could lead to armed conflict. ''I went there favoring Mondale and I came away favoring McGovern,'' said Richard Myers, a farmer from the nearby village of Maxwell.

Unlike President Kennedy's call to put man on the moon by 1970, a manned station would scarcely stretch present technology. Far from being among the ''giant steps for mankind,'' as Mr. Reagan suggested, it would be what his own science adviser called the proposal a year ago: a ''most unfortunate step backward.''"

For several hours, free of any connection with the spaceship and with their own power to maneuver, they will be in effect the first human satellites. They will be testing the new jet backpacks, known as manned maneuvering units, and rehearsing for future roles as orbital repairmen. At an altitude of 190 miles, traveling 17,400 miles an hour, they will practice techniques for approaching and hooking on to space objects, refueling satellites and replacing faulty satellite parts."
