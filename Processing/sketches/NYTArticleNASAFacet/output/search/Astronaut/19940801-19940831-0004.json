The Endeavour is ready to carry out the second Space Radar Laboratory mission and is scheduled to be launched at 6:54 A.M. on Thursday from the Kennedy Space Center. The six crew members arrived yesterday at the launching site, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began a three-day countdown at 11 A.M. Storms approaching from the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas may delay the launching."
