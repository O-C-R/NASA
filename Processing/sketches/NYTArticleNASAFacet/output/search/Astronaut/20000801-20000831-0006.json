Her boombox played songs like Johnny Ray's ''Cry'' and various Elvis Presley hits. For some, this may be the dog-eat-dog, make-a-hard-buck, dot-com era. But for Ms. Schropsdorff and her colleagues at the Doo-Wop Preservation League, it is always the optimistic, futuristic 1950's. Ms. Schropsdorff is a guide for the four-times-weekly Doo-Wop Tours of Wildwood's commercial architecture of the 1950's and 60's. As a trolley (actually a bus made to look like an old-time city trolley) plys the streets of the bustling resort town, Ms. Schropsdorff points out highlights, like Laura's Fudge at Wildwood and Ocean Avenues, where eye-popping neon figures, like the guy stirring a cauldron of fudge, trim the pink-and-blue roof."

Gilruth, an early leader of the American space program and director of the Johnson Space Center during the Apollo lunar landings, died yesterday in Charlottesville, Va. He was 86 and lived near Warrenton, Va. Beyond the limelight occupied by astronauts, flight directors and former German rocket scientists, the reticent and laconic Mr. Gilruth stood aside when the cheering started, puffing on his pipe. When President John F. Kennedy pinned a medal on him in 1962, he froze, speechless, in front of the microphone. He was used to letting others speak for him and the program."

It was an ominous event in the turbulent years preceding World War II. Japan had invaded China in July of that year, and its troops had seized Nanjing, on the Yangtze in east central China, in November."
