Leaders of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations recommended yesterday that the federation endorse Mr. Mondale as the Democratic nominee for President in 1984. But the poll suggested that the endorsement would not suddenly swing most of the membership behind Mr. Mondale. Mr. Mondale, the former Vice President, was favored by 34 percent of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. members interviewed in the poll, and 29 percent said they favored Mr. Glenn, the Senator from Ohio. The five percentage point difference was within the poll's margin of sampling error."

Until a few weeks ago, it looked as if NASA had won. The agency had enlisted strong allies in Congress, the Commerce Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. It had found supporters among White House science and political advisers. Aerospace industry leaders who met with President Reagan came away believing he favored authorizing the project."

At the issues forum conducted by the New York Democratic State Committee, Mr. Glenn seemed to wander when he was asked complicated questions on immigration and economic policy. But then James David Barber, author and political scientist, challenged the Senator's political credentials by likening his space flight in 1962, when he became the first American in orbit, to such publicity stunts as Evel Knievel's attempt in 1974 to vault the Snake River canyon on a rocket-propelled motorcycle."

Spring arrives later in the northern climes and is delayed by altitude. The suggested itineraries cover histsoric and scenic regions of Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland. The degree of skill and amount of time involved vary from a day or two to a week. Some of the walks are gentle rambles, others are demanding treks over sometimes tricky terrain. Suggestions for guidebooks and accommodations follow each walk. BRITAIN 1. Crossing From Coast to Coast 190 miles/304 kilometers from Robin Hood's Bay in Yorkshire to Saint Bee's in Cumbria. Alternating moorland and easy field paths, one or two serious climbs at the western end."

Reubin Askew explain why he is ''the different Democrat.'' This coming Saturday night, on the eve of the premiere of the movie ''The Right Stuff,'' television viewers watching the CBS network are to see a five-minute commercial designed to convince them that Senator John Glenn of Ohio is more than an astronaut. For the Democratic Presidential candidates, the electronic media battle has begun."

Clark, the outgoing national security adviser, and some equally unlikely countercomment by James A. Baker 3d, the White House chief of staff. In the last year, Mr. Clark, who was nominated yesterday by the President as Secretary of the Interior, has opposed colleagues on the White House staff who have counseled compromise on issues such as the MX missile, the military budget and Central America; Mr. Baker was often the one advocating compromise. But on Tuesday in the Cabinet Room, Mr. Clark warned colleagues not to allow the coming Presidential campaign to undo the bipartisan compromises he and Mr. Baker had helped work out recently on some of these issues. According to those present, Mr. Clark said it was more important to preserve bipartisan support for the President's initiatives on arms control and Central America than to attack Democrats who opposed them. Mr. Baker reportedly responded by asserting graciously that foreign policy, Mr. Clark's province at the time, was proving to be a stronger asset for Mr. Reagan politically than anyone had previously realized. An official said Mr. Reagan did not respond to this exchange."

Mondale and Senator John Glenn of Ohio. On its surface, this has been a debate over Democratic Party credentials, over issues such as arms control and over legislative matters such as Mr. Glenn's vote for President Reagan's income tax reduction. But, on a deeper level, what is going on is a contest to see whether it is Mr. Glenn himself or Mr. Mondale who gets to define the political personality that Mr. Glenn projects to the voters in next year's Presidential campaign. Strategists on both sides believe it is this definitional struggle that could be decisive in the race for the Democratic nomination."

The silver-domed star of the ''Tonight'' show does resemble the silver-domed former astronaut. But it was not a comparison I would ever have thought to make. To my middle-aged sensibility, the image of the television comedian will forever be impish and restless, that of the Ohio Senator solid and deliberate."

The hourlong debate, at Harvard University, produced no clear winners in what was, for the most part, a well-mannered, intellectually challenging exchange over one of the most important, divisive issues in the contest for the Democratic nomination. But Senator Alan Cranston of California impressed many in the audience of arms control advocates with his passionate, single-minded emphasis on the dangers of nuclear war. ''Abraham Lincoln was criticized in 1860 for being a single-issue candidate when he concentrated on preserving the Union and checking slavery,'' Mr. Cranston said. ''What is wrong with being labeled a single-issue candidate if your goal is ending an arms race that threatens our very survival, that undermines our economy and wrecks our capacity to deal with all other issues?''"

Like the dragon-slayers of myth, a few men went forth to meet the demons in the sky and do battle in behalf of all lesser mortals. They were acclaimed heroes because they seemed to embody the qualities most esteemed by Americans, rare qualities that were thought to define the best in the national character. These few men, test pilots and the early astronauts, were plain-spoken, rugged individualists who made no apologies for devotion to duty and country. They mastered difficult skills and, as much as anyone could, were masters of their fate. They were incredibly good at what they did and knew it, but had the grace not to flaunt it. And what they did, with risk-all bravery, brought tears of wonder and pride to the eyes of those who beheld their daring and accomplishment. The new movie, ''The Right Stuff,'' opening Friday at local theaters, is a nostalgic scrapbook of this past and an unabashed celebration of the men who are characterized as ''the last true American heroes.'' It is an old-fashioned adventure story."

The film almost makes one glad to be alive in spite of famines, wars and even ''the greenhouse effect,'' which, if the Environmental Protection Agency is correct, means that the entire earth is inside its own space capsule that's rapidly overheating. ''The Right Stuff'' is full of short-term pleasures that yield to doubts only after the film is over. Although the film, which opens today at the Beekman and other theaters, focuses mainly on the care, feeding, training and exploitation of the astronauts, its most commanding figure is not an astronaut but a great test pilot, Chuck Yeager, who exemplifies everything represented by the title. Mr. Yeager, who in 1947 became the first man in the world to break the sound barrier, was not a member of Project Mercury but his story, in the film as in the book, more or less frames those of the astronauts. Systematically testing himself as well as his planes or, in the jargon of the space trade, ''pushing the outside of the envelope,'' Mr. Yeager was the man against whom any pilot who thought he had the right stuff measured himself."

The hand-picked audience of 200 ardent Democrats, most of them New South progressives who had been associated with former President Carter, represented the Southern Democratic Party's loftiest instincts if not its usual voting patterns. The discussion, by a panel that included Mr. Mondale, Mr. Carter, and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk, was high-toned and enlightened. As in other such gatherings of his party's elite, Mr. Mondale demonstrated the easy wit, detailed knowledge and political acumen that often seem lacking in the public performances of his nearest competitor in the opinion polls, Senator John Glenn. All the same, a worrisome question hovered at the edge of Herbert Mabry's mind even as he nodded in agreement with Mr. Mondale's words. Mr. Mabry, the seasoned president of the Georgia American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, is fully committed to Mr. Mondale and zealous about producing the labor vote to defeat Mr. Glenn. He has also seen a lot of campaigns. That is why he turned to a companion and gave words to his question: ''Can he win?''"

A new campaign biography suggests that Senator Glenn has blamed Mr. Mondale ever since 1976 for the poor reception given his keynote speech at the national convention in New York City. In ''Glenn, the Astronaut Who Would Be President,'' Frank Van Riper reports that ''some believe that the noise and interruptions'' during the Glenn speech ''were not spontaneous but part of a plan developed by liberal and labor delegates who favored Mondale'' as Jimmy Carter's running mate ''and hoped to deny the No. 2 spot to Glenn.'' During the Glenn speech, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey and Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr. appeared on the convention floor, prompting television interviews that diverted attention from the lectern."
