In his second and final full day in Brazil, Mr. Reagan flew from Brasilia in the interior to the nation's industrial and financial center to deliver a familiar appeal for free trade and free enterprise unfettered by government controls. Mr. Reagan did not refer to any specific trade disputes with Brazil. The two main ones have been over Brazil's practice of subsidizing exports and the United States effort to lower barriers to international trade in banking, insurance and other services areas. Brazil has led the fight against such a move."

Kennedy's withdrawal from the 1984 Presidential race, some of President Reagan's political associates are working to nudge the President into an early decision to run for re-election. One group of Reagan political aides led by Lyn Nofziger, former White House political director who is now a private consultant, will meet Monday in suburban Virginia for what is described as a preliminary planning session for a re-election campaign. But most of the President's top strategists will be absent. The President's polling consultant, Richard Wirthlin, who is among those invited to the planning session, told reporters today he believed that if the President had to decide now, his decision would be to run again and that an early decision would help his chances. Mr. Wirthlin also contended that even if the economy was in ''pretty rough'' shape in 1984, the President could win re-election if key trends were improving."

The staff was in a tizzy. How should Mr. Reagan respond? According to those who were there, the President had a simple answer: ''We should smother him with love.'' It was a telling moment, because the overriding impression of Mr. Reagan's arduous 15,000-mile trip to Latin America, which ended Saturday night, was of a man seeking to project his personality on to countries that he and others knew had histories of distrust of United States motives."

They arrived in New York in the last month from every state in the Union, as well as from Puerto Rico, Canada, Zimbabwe, Turkey and Trinidad, in response to a ''Santa's Helper'' contest sponsored by McCall's Needlework and Crafts Magazine.

Astronauts have experienced nausea, loss of appetite, drowsiness and cold sweats since the earliest days of manned space flight, especially in spacecraft with enough room for them to move about while in orbit. ''It's not so serious that you're incapacitated,'' said Mr. Alter. ''It's a malaise, not feeling well without specific complaint, perhaps a headache, the nausea and appetite loss.''"
