He still remembers his first day on the job. It was in 1987, a little over a year after an explosion had ripped the roof off the plant's fourth reactor block. ''The trees in the forest behind the station had all died,'' he recalls. ''The pine needles had turned red and dropped off.'' Soldiers were burying the radioactive tree trunks when he arrived for his first shift. Everywhere he looked there were men in masks and dark rubber suits, and orange bulldozers scraping away the contaminated soil."

He went home, gathered some scrap metal from a bed frame, grabbed a long piece of conveyor-belt material and hooked a few used bedsprings to the sides. When the springs failed to provide the elasticity he wanted, he cut out the inner tube of worn tires."

Yet as I sit in Ed Harris's lushly planted yard listening to him talk about Jackson Pollock, it seems quite logical that the story of New York bohemia would gravitate toward sunny California. As we know, there are no second acts in American lives. But for those whose first acts are artfully tormented, there is always a movie. ''Pollock'' will have its American premiere next Saturday as the centerpiece of the 38th New York Film Festival. Harris is in the title role, and the picture marks his directing debut. He gives us a Pollock with so much pain beneath his shy exterior that even when he's eating breakfast or buying milk at the grocery store, he appears monumentally doomed."
