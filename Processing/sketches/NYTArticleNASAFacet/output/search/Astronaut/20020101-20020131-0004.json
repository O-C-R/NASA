RIOT AND REMEMBRANCE The Tulsa Race War and Its Legacy By James S. Hirsch Illustrated. 358 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $25. Philip Dray is the author of ''We Are Not Afraid: The Story of Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney and the Civil Rights Campaign for Mississippi.'' That book examined the 1964 killings of three civil rights workers who were arrested, subsequently abducted, brought to a remote location and summarily shot by members of the Ku Klux Klan. One measure of the impact of Mr. Dray's new book, a full and devastating history of lynching in America, is that the above incident sounds like a model of civility when compared with the monstrous brutality he has now chosen to examine."
