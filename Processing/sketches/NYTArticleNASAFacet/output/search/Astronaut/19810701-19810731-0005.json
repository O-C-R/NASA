''When you throw it up and spin around you never really catch it,'' explained 8-year-old Rebecca Zein of the Red Raiders twirling squad. The Red Raiders of Ridgewood, N.J., were practicing for today's Fourth of July parade. Whether it was putting the final touches on a majestic parade float or poking crepe paper through spokes, readying the yacht for a holiday outing or laying in an extra six-pack, residents of the metropolitan area, like the rest of the nation, prepared to commemorate the signing of the Declaration of Independence in their own ways, many of which would no doubt perplex John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers. Turtle Race in Jersey There will be kayak races and marathon runs, motorized hanggliding and scuba-diving demonstrations, sky-diving exhibitions and Scottish festivals, double-dutch rope-skipping exhibitions and commemorative ''catch 'n fetch'' contests in which dogs leap into the air to catch Frisbees."

The President and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger face a choice that is, superficially, simple enough - whether to build a new bomber, the B-1, and postpone development of the supposedly radarproof Stealth aircraft, or build the B-1 and also finance development of the Stealth. The issue involves far more than the 1980 Republican platform promise of ''accelerated development and deployment'' of a new manned strategic bomber. While platform promises are notoriously perishable, defense promises are less so. The reason the Administration's decision is awkward is that the campaign rhetoric is perhaps more suitable to the comfortable '50's than the troubled '80's."

Fluorescent's glare does not enhance intimate dinners, nor is it imaginable as the cozy light emanating from the woodcutter's cottage of fairy tales. Basically, the tube is the light of offices and subway arcades, and when Dan Flavin first brought it into art galleries during the 1960's, he was, in effect, doing what Marcel Duchamp had done with his ready-mades nearly 50 years earlier. Mr. Flavin has continued to work with neon in its pure form, placing the bars sometimes in their ''natural'' context, as at the railroad tracks at Grand Central Terminal and in the entrance to the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. But he has also explored, through color, the medium's expressive possibilities, besides revealing himself as a romantic through his rapid expressionistic drawings of landscapes. Accordingly, the riot that the artist is now staging at the Castelli Gallery (420 West Broadway) should come as no surprise - although it did to this observer. The installation, occupying two of the gallery's very large rooms, lacks only water and gondolas to make it a vanguard tunnel of love."

Both hold enormous promise for the future, he said, but he argued that it would be unwise to try to develop either technology with a crash program, as some members of Congress are urging, until more basic research is done. These sentiments, representing the evolving Reagan policy on science and technology, emerged as the nominee, Dr. George A. Keyworth 2d, was questioned at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Warm Greeting From Committee The 41-year-old nuclear physicist was greeted warmly by the committee, which is headed by Senator Harrison H. Schmitt, Republican of New Mexico, and his confirmation is expected to be routine."
