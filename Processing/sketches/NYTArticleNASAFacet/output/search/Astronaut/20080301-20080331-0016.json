In his short story ''The Nine Billion Names of God,'' published in 1953, Clarke wrote of a pair of computer programmers sent to a remote monastery in Tibet to help the monks there use a computer to compile a list of all the names of God. Once the list was complete, the monks believed, human and cosmic destiny would be fulfilled and the world would end."

Running on biography is hardly unusual in presidential politics, as presidents from the Rough Rider, Theodore Roosevelt, to the Man from Hope, Bill Clinton, can attest. But Mr. McCain's life story -- he survived the fire aboard the aircraft carrier Forrestal off Vietnam that killed 134 of his shipmates, was shot down over Hanoi, and endured five and a half years as a prisoner of war -- is taking on added importance and seems to have helped him appeal to voters who disagree with him on some issues."
