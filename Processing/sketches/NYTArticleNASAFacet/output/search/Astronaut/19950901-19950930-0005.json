So what else is new in the television universe of the producer Darren Star, a name associated with such trailblazing concoctions as \"Beverly Hills 90210\" and \"Melrose Place\"? Nothing much, as far as \"Central Park West\" is concerned. This is the ferociously ballyhooed series, beginning tonight at 9, that CBS hopes will give the network a new young and bold image advertisers covet. Angela Lansbury may very well get the last laugh. \"Central Park West\" does not, of course, bear the slightest resemblance to the real place. The television locale is populated by airheads constantly playing power games. Nasty schemes litter the landscape. No sooner does Stephanie Wells (Mariel Hemingway) arrive in New York to be editor of a monthly magazine called Communique than she runs up against the Ubervixen Carrie Fairchild (Madchen Amick), a columnist who happens to be the stepdaughter of the top boss (Ron Leibman) who is known as \"the Darth Vader of publishing.\" Carrie is especially venomous toward Stephanie, it seems, because the new editor banned smoking in the office."

      "lead_paragraph": "THE most startling, not to say painful, twin fashion fads of the last few years must be body piercing and tattooing. Once the seedy province of old salts, sideshow freaks and biker molls, tattoos have clearly gone mainstream now that models like Christy Turlington, actresses like Melanie Griffith and athletes like Michael Jordan have got little flowers, pears and fraternity emblems inked into their bodies, inspiring a whole generation of impressionable kids to do the same. You can be sure tattoos have become fashionable when art galleries get into the act, which they have, with shows of tattoo designs. The latest and most ambitious, \"Pierced Hearts and True Love: A Century of Drawings for Tattoos,\" opens tomorrow at the Drawing Center, which is always stretching the outer reaches of what constitutes a drawing. That exhibition dovetails neatly with an excellent historical survey, also about tattoos, called \"The Devil's Blue: American Tattoo Art and Practice Through the Port of New York (1840-1961)\" at the South Street Seaport Museum. Why tattoos now? It's easier to understand why the art world has cottoned to the subject than why young people get them in the first place. Tattoos relate to many trendy art topics. Cartooning, for one. Body art, for another, which means not just art about the body, of which there has been so much (too much) lately, but also art involving the body: the sort of stuff artists like Vito Acconci and Chris Burden did in the 1960's and 70's has become important again to many young artists. Mr. Acconci pressed bottle caps into his skin and burned hair off his chest, which left temporary marks, while Mr. Burden went so far as to have himself shot and crucified, which left very permanent ones. It mattered that those marks could not be bought and sold; whatever else they signified, they were partly about making art that wasn't a commodity like a painting or sculpture or drawing. Plenty of recent art consisting of temporary installations and ephemeral materials wants to make much the same point, as can tattoos. Add to this mix the prominence of performance artists like Bob Flanagan, whose body is elaborately pierced, and Ron Athey, who is covered with tattoos, and what you have is a quasi art whose time has come."
