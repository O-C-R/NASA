Most of those who attended the three-day convention described themselves as homemakers, but secretaries, teachers and dental assistants also discussed the problems they faced as writers. The successful romance novelists, who write under such names as Rebecca Brandewyne, Carolyn Stromeyer Thornton and Philippa Castle, form part of a modern-day cottage industry that is a booming sector of the publishing industry. They package and publish their paperback fantasies under such titles as ''Forever My Love,'' ''Love Is Surrender,'' and ''The Reluctant Duke'' and sell them for $1.75 to $3.95."

''We are all bagladies in our souls,'' says a friend who has certainly had her successes. She tells me of riding a bus recently when a baglady climbed on, heaving herself and her possesions through the door and up the steps. Some sense of pride or purpose, or both, pushed her past the seats reserved for the handicapped and elderly, down the aisle to the back where one long, overheated seat served as an inspection table for the contents of her bags. The men continued to read their papers. ''But the women became very tense, as if she were sending a current through them,'' my friend recounted. ''We sat up straighter, drew our knees together and clutched at whatever was in our laps. When she got up to leave, there wasn't a woman on that bus who didn't turn to watch her safely down the steps, and gaze after her until she was no longer in sight. But she left behind a scent of vulnerability.''"

Mrs. Mason is big in real estate and he sat at her right, next to Barbara Walters and across from the editors of Time and Newsweek, but he didn't allow a table heavily freighted with news people to become a news conference nor to pin him down on the specifics. Yet he left indelible tracks. He'd barely seated himself before wondering about the Reagan Administration's arms control tactics, arguing that this was a big issue with the voters, didn't Henry A. Grunwald of Time agree? And by the time the salmon mousse arrived, he was dealing with crime. ''We must build more prisons,'' he declared. ''Crime is a big issue?'' he asked Mr. Grunwald, the details of whose noncommital answer were lost when Miss Walters asked Mr. Mondale whom he thought was his chief Democratic competitor, and he named Ohio's Senator John Glenn."
