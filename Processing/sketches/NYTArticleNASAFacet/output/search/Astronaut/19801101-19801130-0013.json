You are unlikely to meet anyone else who has been there or who can contradict you about the place. In the past I used to get a lot of dinner-table mileage out of places like Gisenyi on the shores of Lake Kivu in Ruanda, or Alaska's Point Hope on the Chukchi Sea. While others brought up Acapulco I would counter with the Seychelles or Cox's Bazaar in Bangladesh.These places served me well, but Bhutan puts them all in the shade and now the only thing I worry about is runni ng into an astronaut or people who have been to Ulan Bator - not coun ting Mongolians, of course."

They may yawn instead. ''The Space Movie,'' which opens today at the Guild Theater, takes no discernible attitude toward its subject; it simply watches the rockets blast off, or the astronauts drift weightlessly or the planets roll by. These things are eminently watchable, of course, but Mr. Palmer assembles the film so choppily that there's never time to relax with a single image. Just when the surface of the moon is becoming mesmerizing, you'll see an unwanted closeup of an instrument panel, or hear highly technical conversations from Cape Canaveral; the pace of the film is relentlessly nervous."

      "lead_paragraph": "AS a general rule one should be skeptical when a film maker is described as a primitive. Because it's virtually impossible to be primitive in a discipline of such technical sophistication, genuinelyprimitive fil m makers are more rare than genuinely primitive nuclear physicists. The quite extraordinary exception to this rule is a 38-year-old Philippine film maker named Kidlat Tahimik, whose first feature, ''The Perfumed Nightmare,'' opens today in the Agee Room at the Bleecker Street Cinema. Here is a sweet, funny, witty, intelligent little movie, which is also primitive to the extent that its style is direct, sometimes awkward but always unselfconscious. It tends to defy analysis by being so successfully - and so exactly - what it appears to be, that is, a meditation by a young man on his life and the world he aspires to join."

It is the first space mission for two of the astronauts, Leonid Kizim, the 39-year-old flight commander, and Gennady Strekalov, the 40-year-old flight engineer.
