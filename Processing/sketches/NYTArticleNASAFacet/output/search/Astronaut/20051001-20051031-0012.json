His quest was gold. What he discovered instead was of the liquid variety, and something that would quickly become Ecuador's best-selling liqueur. His invention, a drink called Esp√≠ritu del Ecuador, resulted from years of blending exotic fruit and nut extracts in a basement laboratory in Quito. But Mr. Wasas would be the first to admit that the tropical liqueur's real success was largely indebted to its clever packaging -- the bottle is shaped like the famous Quito monument that marks the Equator."

They squirm and stammer, and only one child even comes close. ''Lance Armstrong,'' she says. The scene suggests the underlying point of the 40-minute Imax 3-D movie, which mixes old NASA videotape and spectacular studio re-creations of astronauts landing on the moon and exploring its surface. A generation has grown up since the last Apollo flight in 1972, and knowledge of the explorations is scant. Even among those who were alive to experience the ventures vicariously through grainy black-and-white television images, the memory and excitement have long faded."

She would spend her days in her lab, enjoying the sense of serene focus that comes from immersing yourself for hours at a time in a single project. But when her faculty job began, that all ended. Mark would arrive at her desk in the morning, full of energy and ready to tackle her to-do list -- only to suffer an endless stream of interruptions. No sooner had she started one task than a colleague would e-mail her with an urgent request; when she went to work on that, the phone would ring. At the end of the day, she had been so constantly distracted that she would have accomplished only a fraction of what she set out to do. ''Madness,'' she thought. ''I'm trying to do 30 things at once.''"

One is an alternative version of his ''Virgin of the Rocks,'' with the infant Jesus and the infant John the Baptist. The other, showing Mary Magdalene (right), is thought to have been completed by Leonardo with the help of one of his pupils about 1515. Both are being displayed at the Mole Vanvitelliana museum in Ancona. The painting of Mary Magdalene, which shows her holding a veil over her belly, was only recently discovered and authenticated. Scotty, Beamed Up The cremated remains of James Doohan, right, who played Scotty on ''Star Trek,'' will be launched into space in accordance with his last wishes, Reuters reported. Space Services, a commercial space flight operator, will send them on its Explorers Flight on Dec. 6, a company spokeswoman said. She said the remains of more than 120 others will also be aboard, including those of an unidentified astronaut and Mareta West, the scientist who determined the site for the first spacecraft landing on the moon. Mr. Doohan died in July at 85. Gene Roddenberry, the creator of ''Star Trek,'' also had his remains shot into space after his death in 1991. Footnotes Koichiro Matsuura of Japan, running unopposed, has been re-elected to a four-year term as secretary general of Unesco, Agence France-Presse reported. In a statement, Unesco said that Mr. Matsuura, 68, who was elected in 1999 to a six-year term, since shortened, received the votes of representatives of 151 countries, while 3 voted against him and 9 abstained. Elaine Stritch has added an extra performance to her acclaimed run at the Cafe Carlyle. It will continue through Oct. 30, and she will be back again next year, for a four-week engagement, from Jan. 10 to Feb. 4. The Italian-born conductor Renato Palumbo, 42, is to become the music director of the Deutsche Oper Berlin beginning next season, The Associated Press reported. He succeeds Christian Thielemann, who quit in May 2004 after losing a long battle with Berlin to put the company on a financial par with Daniel Barenboim's Staatskapelle Berlin, the orchestra of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden. The French composer Philippe Manoury, whose music combines electronics with acoustic instruments, will present a rare performance of his works tonight at 8. The concert, overseen by the composer, will take place at the Frederick Loewe Theater at New York University, 35 West Fourth Street in Greenwich Village. Admission is free. Christo and Jeanne-Claude, the husband-and-wife artists, right, whose ''Gates'' project took over Central Park last February, will appear with the filmmaker Albert Maysles at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in public programs this Saturday and next. There will be screenings of Mr. Maysles' documentaries on the artists, going back to 1974, and they will answer questions from the audience. Both programs begin at 1 p.m., and on Oct. 29, a panel discussion of a new film on ''The Gates'' will take place at 7 p.m."

Such footwear may have been silent, and thus ideal for sneaking up on nobles marked for assassination, but it didn't offer much protection against stubbed toes. So tomorrow night, when hundreds of thousands of trick-or-treaters dressed as ninjas hit the streets, most will be donning sneakers or boots, bowing to their worried parents' wishes. To accommodate such clunky footwear, the Jr. Ninja costume from Aeromax Toys has ties at the ankles; the ties can be loosened or tightened according to a shoe's height. It's a minor feature, acknowledges Mark Levine, Aeromax's president. But Mr. Levine also says that such features differentiate the Jr. Ninja costume from the competition."

The first blew off the screen in all its fury, droplets speeding by, stop signs spinning, palm fronds flying and strands of soaked hair clinging to correspondents' foreheads. Debris clattered down deserted streets, and the wind screamed from a growl to a whistle and back again. The second storm was much tamer: palm trees swayed, but with something that looked more like stop-motion animation than deadly natural force. Mostly it looked like a foggy, soundless gray blur. Both hurricanes were Wilma, but one was the large-screen, plasma version; the other belonged to a mobile phone with a screen about one-twentieth the size of the first. One was affixed to a wall; the other could roam all over New York, on the subway, at a playground, in a coffee shop."
