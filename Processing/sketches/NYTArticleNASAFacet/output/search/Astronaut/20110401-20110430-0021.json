He was 72 and lived in Ashland, Ore. His death, from peritonitis, was announced on the Web site of the Foundation for the Law of Time, an organization he founded. The group seeks to rescind the modern Gregorian calendar, which Mr. Argüelles deemed dangerous, and replace it with one rooted in ancient astronomy."

Gagarin. Two Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut are scheduled to ride the Yuri Gagarin rocket into orbit, on their way to the International Space Station; the honorary naming was a departure from the usual Russian practice of numbering rockets. The rocket, scheduled to launch before Tuesday, also has a portrait of Mr. Gagarin painted on the side. He was only 27 years old when he made his first and only journey into space, and he later died in a jet airplane crash. The Soyuz model booster was being fueled Monday evening on the same launch pad where Mr. Gagarin blasted off on his flight on April 12, 1961, which began with his words ''Let's go.''"

In 1976, while under investigation for art fraud, he committed suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills, leaving behind boxes of paperwork that are now yielding some truths. Mark Forgy (pronounced FOR-ghee), a writer in suburban Minneapolis who was Mr. de Hory's assistant and housemate on Ibiza in the 1970s, inherited the archive. He has been poring over it with Colette Loll Marvin, an art historian in Paris. They are conducting interviews and tracking down government records to update a Web site and to produce a documentary and exhibition, both titled ''Elmyr de Hory: The Art and Science of Deception.''"

But severed heads aside, this and other children's verses by Roald Dahl are revolting in another way. They strike a rebellious blow against the prettified world of simpering princesses, predictable princes and monsters that somehow turn out to be cuddly. Dahl's Little Red Riding Hood packs a pistol; his Goldilocks belongs in juvenile court (how many nice little girls do you know who break into houses?); and his Crocky-Wock the Crocodile, cute name notwithstanding, ''likes to crunch/six juicy children for his lunch.''"

His recent songs have the pace of a more confiding time in music, when singer-songwriters in Nashville and Los Angeles were first working out what male sensitivity sounds like. ''Apocalypse'' can resemble an early-1970s record by Gordon Lightfoot or Mickey Newbury, but more heavy-hearted, slowed down by a quarter, with far fewer chords, and with words that embody rather than explain. Its lyrics form a bestiary: cattle, hog, bee and buffalo are all here, as well as the phrase ''work's calving increments and love's coltish punch.'' It works the phrase ''my apocalypse'' into the fourth and seventh songs, which are the first and last tracks of the album's second side in its vinyl version. Its last lyric, sung twice and meaningfully, is ''DC 450'': the catalog number of the album, released last week on the label Drag City."

Years later a 9/11 survivor, an astronaut and a scuba diver would each tell a strikingly similar story about a mysterious presence that guided them to safety in their time of peril. A phantom? An angel? Or a trick of the mind? This ''Explorer'' edition uses recent neurological research -- on subjects like this student, above -- to investigate the phenomenon called ''the third-man factor,'' experienced by hundreds of people. The documentary is based on the book ''The Third Man Factor: Surviving the Impossible,'' by John Geiger, who is an author, with Owen Beattie, of ''Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition'' and the president of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. 8 P.M.
