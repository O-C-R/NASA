MCC Theater presents Glen Berger's gothic fairy tale set in the fictitious Scottish town of Brood (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 279-4200. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman from Feb. 14 through March 26. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'LOVELY DAY' Tiresome evening (1:15). Beckett Theater, Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway * 'APARTMENT 3A' Jeff Daniels's romance about a woman who lost her faith is written with wit, conviction and a real affection for its characters (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255. (Zinoman) 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) 'SAFETY' A cynical, contrived portrayal of the life of a war photographer that attacks its subject with a heavy hand (1:25). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman). * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'HARVEST' Manjula Padmanabhan's sci-fi parable is a dark fantasy about a high-tech racket in body organs -- a cross between the 2002 thriller ''Dirty Pretty Things'' and an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.'' Based in Delhi, India, Ms. Padmanabhan wrote the play in 1996; this is its New York premiere (1:25). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban) * '(I AM) NOBODY'S LUNCH' The elusive nature of truth in a culture swamped with stuff that looks, sounds and smells like information -- but may be something a little more suspicious -- is the serious subject of this merrily unserious, vaudevillian romp through the anxious chatter of contemporary America. Snappy, scrappy and performed with a youthful blend of earnestness and deadpan razzmatazz by the buzzed-about downtown troupe the Civilians (1:30). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'LA PETITE JERUSALEM' (No rating, 96 minutes, in French and Hebrew) In her sensitive but overly schematic debut feature, the filmmaker Karin Albou reflects on the lives of two women living in an Orthodox Jewish enclave in a Parisian banlieue. (Lee) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee)'THE TOLLBOOTH' (No rating, 85 minutes) In ''The Tollbooth,'' 22-year-old Sarabeth Cohen (Marla Sokoloff) narrates the travails of her Jewish American family and her own coming of age. Written and directed with overwhelming earnestness by Debra Kirschner, the movie presents a sincere attempt to address the opposing tugs of tradition and modernity, but is undermined by dated dialogue and a reliance on stereotype. Would a modern Jewish mother really insist that a daughter's lesbianism was a reaction to overwork? (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILMS IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Feb. 14) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalan film continues this weekend with Antoni Ribas's ''Burned City'' (1976), one of the first Catalan-language films released after the death of Franco; and Vicente Aranda's ''Fata Morgana'' (1965-67), a Barcelona School collage that includes Pop Art, performance art and images from Richard Lester's Beatles movies.

(Gates) FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Feb. 12) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. This weekend's films include two stories set in Paris. ''The Last Flight'' (1931), selected by Lou Lumenick, is William Dieterle's Lost Generation drama about American fliers in France just after World War I. Ernst Lubitsch's ''Ninotchka'' (1939), selected by Leah Rozen, stars Greta Garbo as a stern Russian comrade seduced by everything Parisian. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) KARLOFF (Through Thursday) Film Forum's 14-movie festival honoring the great horror star Boris Karloff (1887-1969) begins this weekend with two double features. James Whale's ''Frankenstein'' (1931), starring Karloff as the monster, and Charles Brabin's ''Mask of Fu Manchu'' (1932), with Myrna Loy as co-star, will be shown today and tomorrow. Whale's tongue-in-cheek sequel ''Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935) and Karl Freund's tale of the return of Imhotep, ''The Mummy'' (1932), play on Sunday. 209 West Houston Street, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. THE ACADEMY IS , PANIC! AT THE DISCO, ACCEPTANCE, HELLOGOODBYE (Wednesday) Both the Chicago emo band the Academy Is and Panic! at the Disco were discovered by the pop-punk hitmakers Fall Out Boy. Both play a similar sort of anthemic, stop-start rock, the Academy Is boasting a histrionic front man, and Panic! at the Disco employing drum-machine mechanics. Acceptance and Hellogoodbye also play. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16.50 (sold out). (Laura Sinagra) BABY LOVES DISCO, THE RUB (Tomorrow) Because it's important to introduce your hipster child to good clubs and good music very early, the eclectic hip-hop, funk and global beat mavens DJ Ayres and Cosmo Baker spin a family-friendly afternoon play-date set. Later, they kick the kiddies out and proceed with their monthly dance party called the Rub. 2 to 5 p.m. (Baby Loves Disco), Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $10 ($40 family rate, limit of 5 people). The Rub begins at 10 p.m.; $5 for women; $10 for men. (Sinagra) GLENN BRANCA'S HALLUCINATION CITY: SYMPHONY 13 FOR 100 GUITARS (Tomorrow) One way to hear music is as a convergence of physics and psychology, exploring the ways certain wave forms affect human perception. Since the 1980's, Glenn Branca has been investigating the subtleties of tunings and overtones, creating instruments and compositions that provide an eerie immersion in pure sound. A hundred guitars should make a mighty noise. 7:30 p.m., Montclair State University, Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $25. (Jon Pareles) BURNSIDE PROJECT (Wednesday) The Burnside Project plays its guitars in the intermittently splashing indie-rock style of the slacker 90's but uses electronic burbles beneath them. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. (Sinagra) CALLA (Tomorrow) Burrowing into the dark corners of New Wave's shiny, happy side, the band Calla offers something more than brooding and vintage black couture. 8:30 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sinagra) BLUES FALLIN' DOWN LIKE RAIN: THE MUSIC OF ELIZABETH COTTEN (Wednesday) The guitarist and composer Elizabeth Cotten (1895-1983) added a new dimension to finger-picking blues guitar with her upside-down, left-handed playing on songs like ''Freight Train.'' Her music is honored here by the guitarists Taj Mahal, Mike Seeger, Jolie Holland and Carla Kihlstedt and Mark Orton. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $35. (Sinagra) A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS (Thursday) The former hairdresser Michael Score is etched in the minds of 80's MTV watchers as much for his sculpturally ambitious hairstyles as for songs like ''I Ran'' and the hit ''Wishing.'' He has less hair and new bandmates now. 8 p.m., Crash Mansion, 199 the Bowery, at Spring Street, Lower East Side, (212) 982-0740; $20. (Sinagra) HACKENSAW BOYS (Tomorrow) The eight-member Virginia band Hackensaw Boys plays raw traditional bluegrass with lots of fast fiddling, banjoing, speedy stomps and ripe hollers. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3132; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) HEM (Thursday) Against an orchestral backdrop and acoustic guitars, Sally Ellyson whispers and coos Dan Messe's songs in muslin tones. It's a style that recalls dreamy early 90's indie Americana pop. 8:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9958; $20 to $45.

(Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Thursday) The piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50 (sold out). (Sinagra) THE JUAN MACLEAN (Tomorrow) These know-it-all hipster musicologists play electro disco that sounds like post-industrial slackers having a party in a junk shop, dancing freely. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111 ; $15. (Sinagra) DANIEL LANOIS (Tonight) The producer and atmospheric musician Daniel Lanois here showcases the soundtrack for his experimental film ''Silvio'' with a group that includes the vocalist Lori Anna Reid, the guitarist Jim Wilson and the drummer Brian Blade. 8:30, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 and $35. (Sinagra) JENNY LEWIS WITH THE WATSON TWINS (Sunday) The Rilo Kiley frontwoman Jenny Lewis's solo material is inspired by Laura Nyro-style 70's white soul. Her combination of school-recital fussiness and barely-caught cry is in fine form, but it's her vocal tone and phrasing that make her special. Especially here, where her pointy songbird desperation is augmented by gospel's Watson Twins. 7 p.m., Orensanz Center for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $20. (Sinagra) LOW (Tonight and Monday) For more than a decade, this Duluth, Minn., trio has been writing storm-cloud songs that evoke expansive sadness and long, cold distance. Tonight at 8, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $15 (sold out). Monday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; $15. (Sinagra) AIMEE MANN (Thursday) Ms. Mann's recent concept album about two addicts in the 70's who meet at the Virginia fairgrounds features the astute, sad lyrics and low-key but enduring melodic hooks that this singer-songwriter is known for. Chuck Prophet also plays. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $25 to $35. (Sinagra) RICKY MARTIN (Monday) This Puerto Rican pop superstar, who has been keeping a relatively low profile since his 90's heyday, returns to the spotlight. You wonder if he will incorporate any reggaéton into his act. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-7171; $50.50 to $120.50.(Sinagra) MATT POND P.A., DIOS (MALOS) (Tuesday) The band Matt Pond P.A. has lots of nicely formed indie-pop songs, none very memorable. Live, however, the band, which features a cello, delivers with a forceful crispness. Dios (Malos), a laid-back California quintet, plays shaggy indie-rock marked by questing vocals, dream-pop harmonies and a kind of acoustic-electronic psychedelia that conjures a couch daydream rather than a desert drive. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side; (212) 533-2111; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) GEAROID OhALLMHURAIN AND PATRICK OURCEAU (Tonight) The University of Missouri professor and concertina player Gearoid OhAllmhurain specializes in the traditional songs of his native County Clare. He plays with a sometime collaborator, the French fiddler Patrick Ourceau. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15 free to members and N.Y.U. students. (Sinagra) RAIN (Tonight) Bi (pronounced Bee), the Korean soap-opera heartthrob and pan-Asian pop star whose name translates as Rain, has soaked up English-speaking pop, from Michael Jackson to Usher. He croons ballads, steps through dance tunes and even raps a little, all in Korean, and this concert is part of his long-term plan to add the United States to his fan base. 8:30, Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $60 to $150. (Pareles) RACHEL SAGE (Thursday) This local singer-songwriter makes piano pop folk. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $12 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra) JULIA SARR AND PATRICE LAROSE (Tuesday) The New York Guitar Festival brings to town the West African vocalist Julia Sarr and the guitarist Patrice Larose, who together make introspective music combining the Senegalese and flamenco traditions. 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; $15. (Sinagra) SIGUR ROS, AMINA (Thursday) The Icelandic atmospherists Sigur Ros continue to pursue the hope and dread of open expanse and to conjure with their sung gibberish a kind of ur-poetry. Amina is an all-female string quartet that similarly muses on vastness. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, , (212) 465-6741; $38 to $58.50. (Sinagra) Supergrass (Thursday) This buoyant, hooky mid-90's Brit-pop band had a sound more glammy than Oasis's and heftier than Blur's. By late in the decade, it was tired out, but now seems to have found a new conduit to the old excitement. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25. (Sinagra) M. WARD (Tonight) The echoing guitar folk-pop songs of this singer-songwriter combine heartfelt campfire zeal with the ruminative sadness of midtempo 70's AM radio hits. His delicate ascents can also lilt upward into a cabaret falsetto reminiscent of Jeff Buckley's. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $18.50. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music. BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Tomorrow) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 7 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) * ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow night) Dispensing with her theatrical signature numbers, Ms. Stritch weaves 16 songs new to her repertory into a funny running monologue about her adventures in and out of show business. 8:45, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $125; dinner, required, is served at 6:30; sold out.

LUCIAN BAN AND ASYMMETRY, ALEX HARDING AND BLUTOPIA (Wednesday) The Norwegian label Jazzaway, an increasingly potent outlet for experimentalism, showcases two ensembles with new releases: the pianist Lucian Ban, whose Asymmetry ensemble features the alto saxophonist Jorge Sylvester, the bassist Brad Jones and the drummer Derreck Phillips (in an early set); and the baritone saxophonist Alex Harding, whose Blutopia includes Mr. Ban, the drummer Nasheet Waits and Mr. Jones (in the late set). 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20.(Nate Chinen) SAM BARDFELD QUINTET (Wednesday) Mr. Bardfeld, a violinist with a wide-ranging résumé, regroups the core musicians from his coolly evocative new album, ''Periodic Trespasses (The Saul Cycle)'' (Fresh Sound): the trumpeter Ron Horton, the vibraphonist Tom Beckham, the bassist Sean Conly and the drummer Satoshi Takeishi. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10.

(Chinen) * HIGHLIGHTS IN JAZZ (Thursday) This jazz series produced by Jack Kleinsinger celebrates its 33rd anniversary with some distinguished guests, including the trombonist Slide Hampton and the saxophonists Frank Wess and Jimmy Heath; the pianist Bill Charlap lends his superb trio as a rhythm section. 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, 199 Chambers Street, between Greenwich and West Streets, (212) 220-1460; $30; $27.50 for students. (Chinen) MARC JOHNSON'S SHADES OF JADE (Through Sunday) As he did on the recent album ''Shades of Jade'' (ECM), the bassist Marc Johnson works with the pianist Eliane Elias to produce a bated-breath luminescence; the effect is heightened by the sensitive contributions of Joe Lovano on tenor saxophone, and Joey Baron on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar.

(Chinen) ADAM MAKOWICZ TRIO (Wednesday through Feb. 11) Mr. Makowicz has been a powerful if sometimes elusive presence in jazz since moving to the United States from Poland nearly 30 years ago; his crystalline piano technique is well supported here by the drummer Al Foster and the bassist George Mraz. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) RUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA, MARK DRESSER, GERRY HEMINGWAY (Tonight) This is strenuous experimentalism, but not without a point: Mr. Mahanthappa's flinty alto saxophone tone should abrade effectively against Mr. Dresser's probing bass playing and Mr. Hemingway's textural percussion. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $10.

(Chinen) MIYA MASAOKA TRIO (Sunday) Ms. Masaoka brings an avant-garde sensibility to the koto, a Japanese zither; she also works with a laptop and with the cellist Okkyung Lee and the pianist Sylvie Courvoisier. 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) COOPER-MOORE (Sunday) Cooper-Moore is an extreme polyglot, even by avant-garde standards, as he demonstrates in two afternoon sets: first singing, manipulating electronics and playing percussion with the cellist Nioka Workman and the keyboardist Matt Motel; then playing piano and a host of other instruments, alongside Assif Tsahar on reeds and Chad Taylor on drums. 1:30 and 3 p.m., Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681; cover, $10 per set; $7 for students; free for children 14 and under.

(Chinen) JAKE SHIMABUKURO (Monday) Mr. Shimabukuro is an excitable fusion shredder whose instrument happens to be the ukulele; as on the recent album ''Dragon'' (Hitchhike), he performs with the bassist Dean Taba and the drummer Noel Okimoto, fellow natives of Hawaii. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $20, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen) DR. LONNIE SMITH TRIO (Through Sunday) Under Dr. Lonnie Smith's command, the Hammond B-3 organ can be subtly atmospheric or growlingly ecstatic; he sounds best in this format, with guitar and drums behind him. 8 and 10 p.m. and an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $25 and $27.50, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen) * JOE WILDER QUARTET (Through Sunday) The trumpeter Joe Wilder, still playing well in his mid-80's, has had a wealth of professional experience both in and out of jazz. But he has only rarely led his own group in a New York club residency, which makes this quartet engagement -- with the pianist Michael Weiss, the bassist John Webber and the drummer Lewis Nash -- a sort of landmark event. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.

Monday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Bernard Holland) 'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Tomorrow) Alfano's elegant, ambling ''Cyrano'' returns for a matinee, with Antonio Barasorda once again filling in for Plácido Domingo in the title role. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6200; $220 tickets remain.(Holland) 'RIGOLETTO' (Wednesday) The soprano Anna Netrebko and the tenor Rolando Villazón, opera's hottest vocal couple of late, bring star appeal and impressive artistry to the Met's 1989 Otto Schenk production of Verdi's ''Rigoletto.'' With her dusky-toned and exciting voice, Ms. Netrebko gives an unusually emotional portrayal of Gilda. Mr. Villazón infuses the role of the Duke of Mantua with an ardent voice, Verdian style and virile energy. The baritone Carlo Guelfi makes a stolid but finally sympathetic Rigoletto. Plácido Domingo, who knows a thing or two about the lead tenor role, conducts. 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) The soprano Angela Gheorghiu, who first gained international attention for her portrayal of Verdi's Violetta in performances conducted by Georg Solti, sings the role at the Met. Like others before her, she will have to contend with Franco Zeffirelli's overblown production. Still, she should be abetted by Jonas Kaufmann, a handsome and highly touted German tenor, who is making his Met debut. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Tuesday. (Tommasini) 'DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE' (Tonight) The Metropolitan Opera evidently thinks that Julie Taymor's pageant of a ''Zauberflöte,'' with its wonderful puppets and game-show-style sets, is attraction enough that it can fill it with a less-known, largely homegrown cast. The spectacle is undeniable and sometimes beautiful, but ultimately seems empty without stronger musical values, though Mary Dunleavy does her best as a capable Pamina. Still, the Met is evidently right, because tonight's performance will probably be sold out. 8, Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; returned tickets may be available. (Anne Midgette) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music. Tonight, the pianist Olga Vinokur performs music by Liszt, Chopin, Schumann and Brahms.

(Eichler) MICHAEL GORDON (Tomorrow) This inventive composer has undertaken several collaborations in recent years with the filmmaker Bill Morrison, whose preferred medium at the moment is disintegrating silent film stock from around the 1920's. The poor condition of the film creates imagery of its own -- bubbles, blobs and amorphous shapes that recall those of the psychedelic light shows of the late 1960's. More to the point, it usually matches the impulses of Mr. Gordon's eclectic music. The program includes the premiere of ''Who by Water,'' as well as two older works, ''Light Is Calling'' and ''Gotham.'' 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20.

(Eichler) STEVEN ISSERLIS (Tuesday) A distinctive and quirky artist, this cellist is joined by the pianist Ana-Maria Vera for his New York recital debut, a program with an intriguing twist: every composer on the program acted as a mentor to the one after him, from Mendelssohn and Schumann to Suk and Martinu. 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Midgette) JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its idiosyncratic founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and major works. This week the ensemble's guests are Désirée Halac, a mezzo-soprano; Philippe Quint, a violinist; and Benjamin Hochman, a pianist, who will collaborate on a tasty program that includes songs by Brahms, the Schumann Piano Trio No. 2, a wind sextet by Reinecke and a string quintet by Zemlinsky. 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259; $10 to $25. (Kozinn) STEVEN MACKEY (Thursday) At his best, this American composer writes pieces that draw from his training as a rigorous modernist and his experience as a dynamic rock guitarist. He will talk about this, while introducing and participating in a program of his works in one of Carnegie Hall's Making Music programs. The Brentano String Quartet and the Prism saxophone quartet are among the performers. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20. (Tommasini) EKATERINA MECHETINA (Sunday) This 20-something Russian pianist, who studied in Moscow, won the World Piano Competition in Cincinnati in 2004, and this weekend claims a New York recital as her prize. Her advance billing advertises a strikingly full program, with works by eight composers, from Mozart to Shchedrin. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15 and $20. (Midgette) THOMAS MEGLIORANZA (Thursday) Working with a pianist and a violinist, this adventurous young baritone offers works by Aaron Jay Kernis, Jorge Martín, John Rommereim and others.

(Tommasini) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) It's all-Mozart. This weekend and Tuesday, Jeffrey Kahane conducts and is the soloist for two piano concertos, and also leads the E-flat Sinfonia Concertante. Beginning Thursday, Lorin Maazel conducts four performances of the last three symphonies. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6000; $26 to $94. (Holland) ORLANDO CONSORT (Tuesday) This a cappella ensemble has made several beautifully sung thematic recordings for Harmonia Mundi, with texts so copious that the label has produced them as miniature hard-cover books. The latest, ''The Rose, the Lily and the Whortleberry,'' explores the use of floral imagery by medieval and Renaissance composers to describe both physical and heavenly love. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Kozinn) EMMANUEL PAHUD and YEFIM BRONFMAN (Tuesday) Mr. Pahud, the popular Swiss flutist, is joined by the accomplished pianist for sonatas by Reinecke, Brahms and Prokofiev. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $44 to $52. (Eichler) 'THE PASSION OF OSVALDO GOLIJOV' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The exuberant, genre-bending music of this Argentinean-born composer is the focus of a monthlong festival at Lincoln Center. It continues tomorrow with Dawn Upshaw, the Kronos Quartet and the Andalucian Dogs on a program of arrangements and original music by Mr. Golijov including his ''Ayre,'' a heady song cycle that draws on the folk and pop traditions of the Mediterranean. On Wednesday, the St. Lawrence String Quartet is joined by the cellist David Finckel and the clarinetist Todd Palmer for more Golijov chamber music and Schubert's Cello Quintet. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street; Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65 tomorrow, $45 on Wednesday.

(Kozinn) ROLANDO VILLAZÓN (Tonight) The tenor Rolando Villazón, who has been beguiling audiences at the Metropolitan Opera this season as the duke in ''Rigoletto,'' crosses town to sing a recital at the other Met, in the museum's cavernous Temple of Dendur, which has startlingly reverberant acoustics. The program includes songs by Liszt, Beethoven, Falla, Schumann and others. 8 pm., Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 570-3949; sold out, but returned tickets may be available.

(Ken Johnson) Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) * New York Public Library: 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS,' through Feb. 12. Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069. (Smith) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * P.S. 1: 'The Painted World,' through March 13. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. (See above.) (Johnson) The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through April 16. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray, and artworks in various media relating to chess by Dorothea Tanning, Alberto Giacometti and John Cage, whose chessboard incorporates musical notation for a piano composition that you can hear on headphones. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Johnson) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century., right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. Too, he was a superb colorist, assigning psychological properties to each color, red in particular, which he considered symbolic of power and energy. Among the best works here are his last ones, landscapes that have the magic of Expressionist theater, with houses, trees and the like assuming almost human presences. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) (Johnson) Galleries: Uptown The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter) * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea MIKE CLOUD Mike Cloud is a young artist of the moment, with a project exhibition at P.S. 1, photo-collages in ''Frequency'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem, and new paintings in a solo at Protetch. The work, and his Protetch show in particular, is a tough nut to crack. But rude, funny and meaty, it's well worth the attempt. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999, through Feb. 11. (Cotter) ORI GERSHT: 'THE FOREST' This briefly mesmerizing film consists of silent, panning shots of immense trees interrupted at intervals by the sight and sound of one of them falling violently and slowly to the ground. The mood is somber, even tragic, but in the end, too easily won. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 229-2766; through Feb 11. (Smith) * Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 223-2227, through Feb. 11. (Johnson) ERWIN OLAF The large, carefully staged photographs of people in midcentury American clothes and environments by this successful Dutch commercial photographer look like the dreams of a deeply depressed Norman Rockwell. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) ROXY PAINE The main attraction of this extraordinarily inventive sculptor's show is a computer-controlled sandblaster that is slowly sculpturing a piece of sandstone into something resembling a topographical model of a Southwestern landscape. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) AMY RATHBONE: 'UNBENT' Operating somewhere between Richard Tuttle and Ree Morton, this artist embeds wires of different lengths and colors in the wall to create whiskery textures, clustered hoops or trailing lines. The resulting wall drawings are endearing, if a bit too close to abstract New Yorker cartoons. Priska C. Juschka Fine Art, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-4320; through Feb. 11. (Smith) Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Feb. 11. (Johnson) Other Galleries JOHN BRATTIN: 'THE TRIUMPH OF NIGHT' John Brattin's short film ''The Triumph of Night'' is like a basement-tapes version of ''Wuthering Heights.'' Written and directed by Mr. Brattin, its title lifted from a book of Edith Wharton ghost stories, it delivers a Hollywood-ready Victorian plot in an ingeniously homespun package. Participant Inc., 95 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-4334, through Feb. 12. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) *'DAVID HAMMONS: THE AUTHORIZED RETROSPECTIVE' How do you do a show if you don't have art? Use copies. How do you get copies? Find photographs of the original art. That's what Triple Candie has done with David Hammons's work. The gallery photocopied illustrations of existing, or once existing, Hammons pieces from books and magazines and downloaded others from the Internet. They then taped the 8 1/2 -by-11 prints to the gallery wall. The result: an homage that is very much in this important artist's maverick, dematerialized spirit. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783, through Feb. 12.(Cotter) Last Chance * 'Constructing Realities' See this conceptually ambitious exhibition for Andy Warhol's amazing, rarely seen 1965 film of an 83-year-old performer named Paul Swan who dances and recites poetry in exotic, Middle Eastern-style costumes with wonderfully un-self-conscious verve. A one-act play on video by Mike Kelley; videos transmitted from cellphones for a project by Robert Whitman; a multiscreen video portrait of a man by Gary Hill; Stan Douglas's well-known film ''Der Sandemann''; and a selection of classic Diane Arbus photographs round out the show. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 421-3293; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * Katy Grannan: 'Mystic Lake' Ms. Grannan makes exceptionally intimate photographs of nonprofessional models posing outdoors partly or fully unclothed. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Kim Levin: 'Notes and Itineraries, 1976 - 2004' The longtime art critic for The Village Voice is the subject of a fascinating retrospective that views her career, as well as the history of the New York art scene, through the lens of ephemera that she has accumulated over the past 25 years, including postcard announcements, news releases and handwritten exhibition lists. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3232; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION' With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' (A complete retrospective of Pixar animated films concludes with ''The Incredibles'' (2004), the Oscar-winning story of the Parr family, superheroes trying not to be so super.) In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as those films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; closes Monday. (Smith) * Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE' For 40 years, Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above); closes Sunday. (Kimmelman)"

Michael John LaChiusa, who already has one musical to his name this season, ''See What I Wanna See,'' contributes music and lyrics (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street; (212) 239-6200. 'DEFIANCE' Opens Feb. 28. Set on a Marine Corps base during the 1970's, John Patrick Shanley's new play, his first since ''Doubt,'' revolves around an explosive incident between an African-American marine and a white one. Doug Hughes directs (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. 'GREY GARDENS: A NEW MUSICAL' Previews start today. Opens March 7. Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric socialite relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. 'INDOOR/OUTDOOR' Opens Feb. 22. The playwright Kenny Finkle aims for the cat lover demographic in this relationship comedy about a computer programmer and his chatty feline companion (1:50). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Opens Feb. 27. Dead pets, severed limbs, black Irish humor -- Martin McDonagh (''Pillowman'') is up to his old tricks in this devilish comedy about terrorism and torture (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea; (212) 239-6200. 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Opens Feb. 23. Labor unrest leads to romance in this classic musical about a manager and a union representative at a pajama factory. Harry Connick Jr. stars, and Kathleen Marshall directs (2:30).

This New York Musical Theater Festival hit is a satirical musical about several artists racing to finish a musical in three weeks. Apparently, they got it done (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 353-0303. 'THE WOODEN BREEKS' Opens Feb. 21. MCC Theater presents Glen Berger's gothic fairy tale set in the fictitious Scottish town of Brood (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 279-4200. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Beginning Tuesday, Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodóvar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street; (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) * 'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates) 'A BITTER TASTE' When an academic gets too close to one of his case studies, his mistake haunts him in this twisty, acid drama about repression, friendship and the intersection between sex and power (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) 'ELLIOT, A SOLDIER'S FUGUE' True to its title, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue'' is composed like a fugue, with several narrative strands playing in point and counterpoint around one theme: a soldier's experience of war. The play, by Quiara Alegria Hudes, traces the legacy of war through three generations of a Puerto Rican family, and without invoking current politics, manages to indict the war in Iraq (1:10). 45 Below at the Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban) 'GIRL IN HEAT' Nelson Avidon's predictable dramedy about Joseph, a randy lawyer, and Marilyn, a flirtatious office temp, is salvaged to some extent by the play's two performers. As their characters reveal themselves uneasily, Mr. Avidon and Cheryl Leibert make the struggle believable (1:20). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens) 'LENNY & LOU' This black comedy by Ian Cohen about two brothers and their foul-mouthed, demented mother has the right ingredients for shock theater: four-letter words, sex talk, sex acts. But it somehow doesn't shock (2:15). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444. (Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street; (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Isherwood) * 'APARTMENT 3A' Jeff Daniels's romance about a woman who lost her faith is written with wit, conviction and a real affection for its characters (1:30). Arclight Theater, 152 West 71st Street; (212) 352-0255; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'BURIED CHILD' Sam Shepard's dark and sometimes funny portrait of a dysfunctional Midwestern family doesn't translate successfully into the bright colors of Norman Rockwell Americana. The director, Cyndy A. Marion, and her White Horse Theater Company did much better a year ago with a production of another Shepard play about family, ''The Late Henry Moss,'' which was full of mystery and emotion (2:40). The American Theater of Actors, Sargent Theater, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Stevens) 'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger) 'SAFETY' A cynical, contrived portrayal of the life of a war photographer that attacks its subject with a heavy hand (1:25). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. (Zinoman) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott) 'COWBOY DEL AMOR' (No rating, 86 minutes, in English and Spanish) For 16 years, Ivan Thompson, a self-styled 'Cowboy Cupid,' has been supporting himself by helping disenchanted American men meet hopeful Mexican women. Directed by Michèle Ohayon with an attentive ear for the regressive attitudes beneath the humor, ''Cowboy Del Amor'' is a slyly insightful portrait of conflicting expectations in the search for the perfect partner. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) 'A GOOD WOMAN' (R, 93 minutes) This loose adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1892 comedy, ''Lady Windermere's Fan,'' moves it out of the drawing room, and out of England to the Italian Riviera in 1930, casting as its leads two American actors (Helen Hunt and Scarlett Johansson) who have no feel for Wilde's high-toned repartee: fatal mistakes all. (Holden) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School in Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden) Film Series ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILM IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Tuesday) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalán film continues this weekend with screenings including Pere Portabella's ''Warsaw Bridge'' (1989), three parallel stories set all over Barcelona; Agusti Villaronga's ''In a Glass Cage'' (1987), a drama about depravity that the American director John Waters has said he found shocking; and ''Fausto 5.0'' (2001), the Catalán theater group La Fura dels Baus's interpretation of Goethe's ''Faust.'' Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. It continues this weekend with ''The Liberace of Baghdad'' (2004), Sean McAllister's portrait of Samir Peter, a concert pianist reduced to playing in a hotel bar; Erwann Briand's ''Women of Mount Ararat,'' about an all-female unit of Kurdish guerrillas; and numerous shorts. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program honoring Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82) continues this weekend with ''Effi Briest'' (1974), starring Hanna Schygulla as a 19th-century teenager who marries an older man. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Sunday) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. The series ends this weekend with five films, including Stephen Frears's 1985 comic drama, ''My Beautiful Laundrette,'' selected by Gene Seymour, about two young men who go into business together and fall in love; and Roko Belic's ''Genghis Blues'' (1999), selected by Lisa Schwarzbaum, a documentary about a blind American blues musician who teaches himself throat-singing. 36-01 35th Avenue, at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. The first weekend's films include ''Don't Forget You're Going to Die'' (1995), Xavier Beauvois's tale of a student who is told he's not long for this world; ''The Gardener'' (1980), Jean-Pierre Sentier's absurdist fairy tale set at a factory; and Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 New Wave classic, ''Breathless.'' 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) RECENT FILMS FROM SWEDEN (Through Feb. 22) Scandinavia House's program of Swedish features continues with ''Harry's Daughters'' (2005), Richard Hobert's psychological thriller about two sisters who become pregnant at the same time. 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. OLETA ADAMS (Tuesday) The comfort and uplift of gospel music infuse Oleta Adams's secular and kindly songs. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $32 in advance, $35 at the door. (Jon Pareles) BISHOP ALLEN (Tonight) The indie pop outfit Bishop Allen is in the spotlight lately for its frontman Justin Rice's leading-man turn in Andrew Bujalski's film ''Mutual Appreciation.'' In it he plays to a receptive but sparse Brooklyn crowd. His own band has a slightly larger following. 9:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Laura Sinagra) LAURA CANTRELL (Tonight) This singer, guitarist and songwriter has a deep alt-country résumé that includes an old-timey country radio show on WFMU (91.1 FM) and real Southern roots. She writes clever ditties about the urban romantic experience. 7:30, Mo Pitkin's, 34 Avenue A, near East Third Street, East Village, (212) 777-5660; $15. (Sinagra) CELEBRATION (Thursday) Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. This bill also includes Hong Kong and Baby Shakes. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra) ELECTRIC SIX, SHE WANTS REVENGE (Tomorrow, Sunday and Monday) The Detroit garage rockers Electric Six broke out of the pack by virtue of the singer Dick Valentine's mania on songs like ''Danger! High Voltage.'' The band's new album, ''Senor Smoke,'' is less compelling, but features the timely apocalyptic rumination ''Jimmy Carter.'' She Wants Revenge plays post-punk in the dark Interpol style. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door (both days sold out); Monday at 8 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra) FEIST, JASON COLLETT, MATES OF STATE (Tonight) The Canadian bohemian Leslie Feist is good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best cabaret-pop songs are quirky jazz numbers; she sounds like a hipper Norah Jones. Jason Collett makes loud music with the Broken Social Scene collective, and softer music on his own. The indie-pop duo Mates of State open. 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 (sold out). (Sinagra) DIAMANDA GALAS (Tuesday) Putting the demon in demonstrative, the vocalist and pianist Diamanda Galás uses love's biggest commercial holiday as an excuse to mine the dread and catharsis from romance-related original songs and covers of some classics. 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $20. (Sinagra) JESSE HARRIS (Monday) In preparation for the release of his album ''Mineral'' (Secret Sun), this singer-songwriter and Norah Jones collaborator will play a regular Monday night residency for the month. His new material recalls the rootsy but ethereal mood of Paul Simon's early albums, with lyrics evoking more dreamy ennui than solitary pathos. He has assembled a new band to accompany him. 10 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; no cover. (Sinagra) IL DIVO (Tonight and tomorrow night) In the tradition of the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, this pop quartet was formed after a two-year search.

He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences.

True, it's about as uninventive as programming can be, but Lorin Maazel has proved a surprising Mozart conductor lately, and during the first two weeks of this minifestival, the Philharmonic players have been at their zestiest. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Kozinn) PACIFICA QUARTET (Sunday) This young ensemble, based at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, gave a memorable performance at Alice Tully Hall in 2004, and last year released a solid, richly played traversal of the Mendelssohn string quartets on the Cedille label. It returns for one of Lincoln Center's early morning concerts, with Mendelssohn's Quartet in E flat and Tchaikovsky's Quartet in D. 11 a.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500; $20. (Kozinn) STAATSKAPELLE BERLIN (Tomorrow and Sunday) Daniel Barenboim reminds New York that he has an orchestra other than the Chicago Symphony. Conducting Germany's oldest orchestra, which he has led for more than a decade, he celebrates this year's birthday boy, Mozart, with two programs, each with two symphonies and a piano concerto in E-flat. Tomorrow's concerto is for two pianos; joining Mr. Barenboim will be Radu Lupu. Tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 2, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38 to $130. (Midgette) ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tuesday) The Orchestra of St. Luke's may be the most protean group in town. Here its members appear in various chamber combinations for works by Mozart, Debussy, Chopin and Schoenberg. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35. (Eichler) 'VOICES OF LIGHT' (Thursday) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and her execution at the stake. His texts draw on the Bible, Joan's letters, the works of Hildegard of Bingen and other medieval churchwomen, and ''The Vices of Women,'' a 13th-century misogynistic ballad; his music pivots between the medieval world and ours. During a screening of the film, it is to be performed live by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8 p.m., World Financial Center, West Street, South of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tuesday through Feb. 19) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching. This program presents three dances new to New York audiences: ''Fever,'' to Monteverdi; ''Such Longing,'' to Chopin's Nocturnes and Études; and ''Gypsy Mixture,'' from the delightfully titled CD ''Electric Gypsyland.'' Tuesday through Feb. 18 at 8 p.m., Feb. 19 at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $38. (Roslyn Sulcas) * RONALD K.

(Dunning) * GINA GIBNEY DANCE (Thursday) Ms. Gibney explores the worlds of finite reality and the unknowable, and she has made a third new world of them in her mysterious, subtle ''unbounded.'' (Through Feb. 19.) 8:30 p.m. Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Dunning) CURT HAWORTH (Tonight through Sunday) ''Descent'' presents a choreographic panorama of 24 hours in a city on the brink of war. 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Anderson) SARA EAST JOHNSON AND LAVA (Tonight through Sunday and Thursday) Ms. Johnson's award-winning, all-female company, LAVA, presents ''(w)HOLE'' (short for ''The Whole History of Life on Earth''), its first new work since 2003. Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve. (Through Feb. 19.) Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25.(Erika Kinetz) HEATHER KRAVAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) What promises to be a lively, internationally flavored double bill, with a three-year, long-distance collaboration between Heather Kravas from New York and Antonija Livingstone from Montreal by way of Berlin, and a duet from PO.V.S., a dance collective from Moscow. 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $12 and $20. (Rockwell) METRO MOVEMENT PROJECT (Tonight and tomorrow night) In ''Modern Dance: Primitive Lights,'' dance by choreographers including Meg Brooker, Claire Elizabeth Barratt, Mark Lamb, Wendy Blum and Vong Phrommala will be presented in four programs, all performed in candlelight in a church setting, to live music and the spoken word. 7 and 9, Metro Baptist Church, 410 West 40th Street, Clinton, (917) 279-1941; $15; $7 for students and 65+. (Dunning) * THE NETA DANCE COMPANY A.W.A.R.D. SHOW (Sunday) This free monthly performance series organized and produced by the choreographer Neta Pulvermacher began in January and runs until May. It's a great idea -- each event presents work by four emerging or midcareer choreographers, then opens up discussion between the artists and the audience. Later everyone has a drink. Melinda Ring, Pele Bauch, Barbara Duffy and the wonderful Keigwin & Company are on the lineup, and Thomas DeFrantz will moderate the discussion. Call first -- the Joyce SoHo had to turn people away last time. 7 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479 or www.joyce.org. (Sulcas) NEW CHAMBER BALLET (Tomorrow) Choreography by Miro Magloire, the company's director, and Deborah Lohse and Constantine Baecher will be performed by dancers including Deborah Wingert. 8 p.m., City Center Studio 4, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444 or www.smartix.com; $15; $10 for students with ID. and ages 65+ (Dunning) NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL 2006 (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) The city's annual celebration of all things Flamenco continues into its second week tomorrow night with the guitarist Vicente Amigo and an ensemble that includes the dancer Rafael Campallo. A gala on Wednesday night lines up some of flamenco's big guns, including the legendary Manolo Marin and Soledad Barrio, often seen in New York with Noche Flamenca. On Thursday, the Nuevo Ballet Español shows flamenco in a more contemporary guise -- a slightly doubtful enterprise -- featuring the wonderful Lola Greco. Various locations; for information: (212) 545-7536 or www.worldmusicinstitute.org/wmical/Main.asp (Sulcas) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL (Tomorrow through Feb. 19) This 12-year-old festival has a noteworthy lineup over its second week. WilliamsWorks, a new troupe directed by a former New York City Ballet dancer, Todd Williams, gives its final performances this weekend (tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.), and the Tel Aviv-based Sally-Anne Friedland Dance Drama Company makes its United States debut. In her world premiere of ''Borders'' and the American premiere of ''Red,'' we are promised that ''the abstraction of dance meets the drama of life'' (Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Feb. 18 at 8 p.m.; Feb. 19 at 2 and 7 p.m.) Ailey Citigroup Theater, Joan Weill Center for Dance, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; students and 62+, $15. (Sulcas) * STARS OF THE 21ST CENTURY (Monday) Cheesy but usually amusing and sometimes thrilling, these potpourris of dancers from hither and yon, performing to recorded music and offering sometimes challenging choreography but mostly flashy showpieces, are always worth a visit. This year the galaxy, many returning from previous galas, includes Irina Dvorovenko and her husband, Maxim Beloserkovsky, from American Ballet Theater; Sofiane Sylve from the New York City Ballet; Svetlana Lunkina and Sergei Filin from the Bolshoi Ballet; Andrian Fadeyev from the Kirov Ballet; Mathilde Froustey and Emmanuel Thibault from the Paris Opera Ballet; Lucia Lacarra and Cyril Pierre from the Munich Ballet; Pilar Alvarez and Claudio Hoffmann from Tango Metropolis Argentina; and Desmond Richardson from Complexions. 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570 or (212) 721-6500; $20 to $150. (Rockwell) THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS (Tonight through Sunday) This year's Pow-Wow, the company's 31st, includes dances, stories and traditional music from the Iroquois and American Indians of the Northwest Coast, the Southwest, the Plains and the Arctic regions. (Repeated next weekend.) Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109 and www.theaterforthenewcity.net. Evening performances: $10. Matinees: $10; $1 for children under 12 accompanied by a ticketholding adult. (Dunning) THE WALDEN COMPANY (Sunday) A new musical, ''All is Full of Love,'' by the choreographer Josh Walden, is based on the narrative of ''On the Town,'' but set to the music of Bjork. The one-time performance (presumably Mr. Walden is hoping for more) partly benefits Dancers Responding to AIDS. 8 p.m., Theater at St. Clements, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101 or TheaterMania.com; $39.90 to $81.50 (includes preshow reception). (Sulcas) * REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction. (Through Feb. 18 and Feb. 22 to 25.) 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith) ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639(Johnson) Galleries: Uptown * Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through Feb. 18. (Cotter) The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter) Galleries: 57th Street * Maria Elena González This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. González encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter) * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson) JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'NOW' As a pendant to the photographer's survey at the Museum of Modern art, this show focuses on images of the land and outbuildings on his upstate farm, with special attention to the seasonal changes and akimbo branches of numerous apple trees. Pace/MacGill Gallery, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Feb. 18. (Smith) Galleries: Chelsea WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 367-7474, through Feb. 18. (Smith) Molly Davies This expansive show features major works from three decades by a veteran avant-gardist film and video maker. Ranging from near-abstraction to dreamlike allegory, the video installations of Ms. Davies call to mind artists as various as Gary Hill and Bill Viola. Some involve collaboration with musicians and dancers, and the esteemed poet Anne Carson stars in a sensuous and stately three-screen production from 2002 called ''Desire.'' Zone, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2177, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) ERWIN OLAF The large, carefully staged photographs of people in midcentury American clothes and environments by this successful Dutch commercial photographer look like the dreams of a deeply depressed Norman Rockwell. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Feb. 18. (Johnson) Wu Jian'an: 'Daydreams' Trained in the art of paper cutting, this young Chinese artist scissors swirling, wonderfully intricate and fantastic compositions of figures, body parts and animals from single large sheets of white paper. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, between 24th and 25th Streets, (212) 414-1169, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'It's a Beautiful Day' Sweet but with an acid center, this group show includes Mie Yim's smudgy painting of stuffed animals in an overripe landscape; Charlene Liu's pale watercolor vision of wrecked cars in an overgrown valley; Satoru Eguchi's architectural photographs cut into lacy patterns; Margaret Lee's watercolor pictures of rock formations with graffiti carved into them; Saeko Takagi's pastel-colored paintings of wan, blond models; Misaki Kawai's funky, storytelling marine sculptures; and Koji Shimizu's sculpture in the form of climbing equipment for cats. ISE Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 925-1649, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Other Galleries Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana,: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation ofrecent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) Last Chance MARIA MAGDALENA CAMPOS-PONS: backyard dreams See this show for the large, gorgeously colored multiphoto works in which drawing, painting and photography merge with intimations of the female, otherness and a distinctly tropical locale. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'DAVID HAMMONS: THE UNAUTHORIZED RETROSPECTIVE' How do you do a show if you don't have art? Use copies. How do you get copies? Find photographs of the original art. That's what Triple Candie has done with David Hammons's work. The gallery photocopied illustrations of existing, or once existing, Hammons pieces from books and magazines and downloaded others from the Internet. They then taped the 81/2 -by-11 prints to the gallery wall. The result: a homage that is very much in this important artist's maverick, dematerialized spirit. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 865-0783; closes Sunday.(Cotter) * Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) CHRISTOPHER MINER: HOW BEAUTIFUL HEAVEN MUST BE In this split-personality debut, the artist mimics a drunken black man in one video, and in another, takes a remorseful, memory-laden tour of his dead grandparents' house. The prevailing impression is of white, male, not necessarily Southern emptiness and disconnection. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century, right up there with the likes of Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Arthur Dove and Charles Demuth, to name a few. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676; closes Sunday.

(Ages 12 and up) Illustrated in ghostly tempera on cardboard, Nelson's most recent book takes the form of a heroic crown of sonnets, interlinked poems in which the last line of each becomes the first line of the next. An afterword describes in unadorned language the events of 1955, when 14-year-old Emmett Till was murdered in Mississippi; the eerie and allusive verses (''watch-fob good-luck charms teeth pulled out with pliers'') are more about evoking a sense of horror and conscience.

Duecker's new office at 1 Police Plaza is its utter lack of homeyness. Martha Stewart would be appalled. ''You were expecting something a little less austere?'' asks Mr. Duecker (pronounced DECK-er), who at 42 is whippet-fit and fidgety. ''Never been my style. I keep all that stuff in a box in my basement.'' Possibly in his line of work, which he tersely describes as ''preventing, detecting and deterring terrorism at the local level,'' this display of depersonalization is a personal statement in and of itself. Objectivity is a must. Subjectivity is an impediment."

'GREY GARDENS' Opens March 7. Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric socialite relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Opens Feb. 27. Dead pets, severed limbs, black Irish humor -- Martin McDonagh (''Pillowman'') is up to his old tricks in this devilish comedy about terrorism and torture (1:45).

Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Broadway * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show written and performed by Sarah Jones is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punchline. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JUMP/CUT' Neena Beber's play about an aspiring filmmaker's effort to document his best friend's illness limns despair while leaving the audience exhilarated -- by the fierce beauty of Beber's writing, and by a captivating performance by Luke Kirby as the brilliant, charismatic, darkly funny manic-depressive whose inescapable fate is the central mystery of the work (2:10). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the archmanipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'AVALON' Glory Sims Bowen's retelling of the Camelot legend from the women's point of view is entertaining but too long and uncertain in tone. The comic moments work better than the earnest ones (2:20). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Anita Gates) 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 'THE BOOK OF THE DUN COW' An animal allegory about good and evil, this family musical by Randy Courts and Mark St. Germain is on the didactic side and could use more oomph. Providing some are an electric villain, Micah Bucey, and a warm-voiced mezzo, Carol Hickey. Still, a number of children at a recent performance seemed absorbed: they didn't squirm, they watched (2:15). West End Theater in the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Andrea Stevens) * 'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 'PARADISE' A mostly articulate drama about an inarticulate young man who may have found Mr. Right or the tipping point that leads him into madness (1:30). Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444.( Zinoman) 'REAL BLACK MEN DON'T SIT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR' The poet and playwright Malik's series of quick, interwoven scenes tracing the lives of African-American men in America, mainly in the last half century, can pack an emotional punch, but it works better as a showcase for some outstanding performances by its eight-member cast than it does as a theater piece (2:00). New Federal Theater, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Stevens) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian''comedienne'' is a Style book prohibition/lg Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212).868-4444. closing March 10 !(Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100.(Brantley) Last Chance 'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley) * 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by H.I.V. diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood) * 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closing Sunday. (Brantley) 'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine-tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing Sunday. (Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'ANNAPOLIS' (PG-13, 108 minutes) ''Annapolis'' is so gung-ho about the United States Naval Academy's ability to turn boys into fighting men and rebels into scrappy team players that it could easily be confused with a military recruiting film. (Stephen Holden) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden) * 'BUBBLE' (R, 72 minutes) A rigorously minimalist story about three factory workers, all played by nonprofessionals, whose placid existence is shattered after two in the little group become romantically linked. Violence liberates the three from the bubble of their existence, much as creative experimentation has periodically liberated the movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, from the prison of commercial mainstream filmmaking. (Manohla Dargis) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DESERT WIND' (No rating, 80 minutes, in French) In March 2004, the Swiss documentarist François Kohler took 13 men -- Canadian, French, Swiss and Belgian -- on a two-week trek in the Tunisian Sahara. The group was accompanied by a Swiss psychotherapist, as well as by a team of Tunisian guides with pack camels. The purpose of the trip: to stage a kind of men's encounter group in the desert, encouraging the participants to break away from received notions of masculinity and to talk about their desires, anxieties and deepest fears. Though it generates its share of unintentional giggles, ''Desert Wind'' does manage to take us to a seldom-visited place: the hidden corners of the straight male mind. (Stevens) 'FILM GEEK' (No rating, 78 minutes) Scotty Pelk (Malik Malkasian) is a diminutive, socially addled young man whose sole interest in life is the cinema. When he's fired from his job for, in essence, being too annoying, Scotty goes on a downward spiral, begging for work at every video store in town and obsessively courting a pretty film fan (Tyler Gannon) despite her increasingly humiliating rejection of him. Despite this semiautobiographical film's likable premise, Scotty Pelk, as written by James Westby and played by Mr. Malkasian, is actually so irritating, so genuinely hard to take, that like the rest of the characters in the movie, we soon find ourselves itching to get away from him. (Stevens) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie clichés, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Lee) 'IMAGINE ME & YOU' (R, 93 minutes) A bland romance from the British writer and director Ol Parker about a woman (Piper Perabo) who's fast-tracking down the straight and narrow when the florist-next-door (Lena Headey) throws up a roadblock. (Dargis) * 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott) 'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) 'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'THROUGH THE FIRE' (No rating, 103 minutes) Jonathan Hock's unwaveringly upbeat documentary follows the basketball sensation Sebastian Telfair, a senior at Lincoln High School on Coney Island, as he chooses between the University of Louisville and the N.B.A. Yet behind the cheering and popping flashbulbs lurks another, much darker movie, one that questions the relationship between sneaker manufacturers and financially deprived kids with exceptional talent. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'A YEAR WITHOUT LOVE' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Spanish) Anahí Berneri's debut film recounts in uncomfortable close-up the day-to-day activities of a youngish gay writer from Buenos Aires afflicted with AIDS, who becomes involved in S-and-M. Based on the diaries of the real Pablo Peréz (he is also co-writer of the script), the film reveals rare insight into the endurance and treatment of illness, but is never fully arresting. (Laura Kern) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series BEST OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA FILM FESTIVAL (Through Wednesday) BAMcinematek's festival of independent black films from around the world begins today. This weekend's features include Tim Greene's ''Boy Called Twist'' (2004), a South African version of ''Oliver Twist,'' which won the audience award at the Toronto Film Festival; Gavin Hood's ''Tsotsi'' (2005), based on Athol Fugard's book about a young gang leader who steals a car but doesn't notice the baby in the back seat; and ''Faces of Change'' (2005), Michèle Stephenson's documentary about activists in five countries. Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Anita Gates) DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. It continues this weekend with Michael Culpepper and Nikki Draper's ''Bachelor Farmer'' (2005), about gay men living in a small Idaho town; Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda's ''Czech Dream'' (2004), about a promotional campaign for a nonexistent supermarket; and numerous shorts. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates) FASSBINDER (Through Feb. 26) IFC Center's Weekend Classics Program honoring Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1946-82) continues this weekend with ''The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant'' (1972), a drama about an arrogant fashion designer in love with a young model. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75. (Gates) GET ANIMATED WITH WALLACE & GROMIT (Through Feb. 24) The Museum of the Moving Image is presenting a week of matinee screenings of Wallace and Gromit movies, starring Nick Park's animated inventor and his newspaper-reading dog. The program begins on Sunday with the short films ''A Close Shave,'' ''The Wrong Trousers'' and ''A Grand Day Out.'' The first two won Oscars for best animated short. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) JOSEPHINE BAKER ON FILM (Through Feb. 26) The Museum of the Moving Image celebrates Baker's centennial with a 10-day retrospective of her films. It begins tonight with the North American premiere of ''La Revue des Revues'' (1927), including previously unseen film of Baker's nightclub act. The film will be introduced by Geoffrey Holder. Marc Allégret's ''Zouzou'' (1934), the story of a poor girl who wants to be a star, will be shown tomorrow afternoon, introduced by Jean-Claude Baker. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10. (Gates) RECENT FILMS FROM SWEDEN (Through Wednesday) Scandinavia House's program of Swedish features continues with ''Illusive Tracks'' (2003), Peter Dalle's comic thriller, set at the end of World War II, about a writer determined to help the Germans start over. 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ANTI-SOCIAL MUSIC (Thursday) The Anti-Social Music is a forum created to nurture a hybrid chamber music that is filtered though a punk sensibility, drawing on the talents of musicians in local bands like the Hold Steady, Ida, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Gang Gang Dance, World/Inferno Friendship Society and Balkan Beat Box. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $10. (Laura Sinagra) BOBBY BARE JR., TEDDY THOMPSON (Tuesday) Bobby Bare Jr. of Nashville is a blunt songwriter who doesn't mince words. His music tweaks Americana with sounds from the new weird America. Another musical scion, Teddy Thompson, looks to distinguish himself from his folk-rocker parents, Richard and Linda, while still honoring their legacy. His baritone voice sounds like his father's without the bite, not always a bad thing. 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra) BLACK REBEL MOTORCYCLE CLUB, ELEFANT (Tomorrow) Moving lately from the surly, noisy sound its name implies to a rootsier realm, the Los Angeles rockers Black Rebel Motorcycle Club now play harmonica and strum away on acoustic guitars. Elefant mines the same dark post-rock vein as Interpol, but without the tension and heft. 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $22 in advance, $25 at the door (sold out). (Sinagra) BUCKWHEAT ZYDECO (Tomorrow) Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural Jr. is a zydeco accordionist whom rockers can love. He bolsters the hefty sound of his accordion with a horn section, and his sets include plenty of gutsy blues tunes, along with Cajun two-steps and waltzes. The band is an indefatigable party generator. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $20.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Jon Pareles) GENO DELAFOSE AND FRENCH ROCKIN' BOOGIE (Sunday). Geno Delafose, the son of the zydeco accordionist John Delafose, holds on to the traditions of an older generation, pumping waltzes and two-steps and blues on his button accordion, keeping the old bayou flavor. 7:30 to 11 p.m., with free zydeco dance lessons at 6. Connolly's on 45th, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 597-5126; $22 (Pareles). THE DIRTBOMBS (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Detroit garage rocker Mick Collins's outfit tears through its live sets, unafraid of dissonance and rough edges. Mr. Collins has a more resonant voice than some of his shouty contemporaries. Tonight at 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $13. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $13. (Sinagra) LUDOVICO EINAUDI AND BALLAKE SISSOKO (Wednesday) The Italian composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi and the Malian kora player Ballake Sissoko collaborate on a repertory including Malian music, blues and Caribbean styles. Each will play individually; then they will perform together. 9.30 pm. Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sinagra) GZA, DJ MUGGS (Sunday) The GZA (Genius) from the Wu Tang Clan and DJ Muggs from Cyress Hill collaborate for some Brooklyn and Staten Island hip-hop bonding. 8 p.m., B.B.

(Sinagra) IDA, JENNIFER O'CONNOR (Tuesday) With its dreamy folk-pop, the trio Ida combines aching harmonies and a supple sense of play. The local songwriter Jennifer O'Connor is also on the bill. 7:30 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 475-7088; $10. (Sinagra) MASON JENNINGS (Thursday) Folk-rock from a songwriter in the John Mayer and Dave Mason mold, sometimes quiet and plaintive, sometimes working up to jam-band peaks. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $18 in advance, $20 at the door (sold out).

(Anne Midgette) 'ALBERT HERRING' (Tomorrow) The Gotham Chamber Opera has been earning its stripes with striking stagings of everything from Handel's ''Arianna in Creta'' to Respighi's version of ''Sleeping Beauty'' (with puppets).

(Midgette) 'HERCULES' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Handel opera is rarely heard, but it has plenty to offer, not least a plot that describes a love triangle that proved lethal for Hercules.

(Midgette) * LUIGI DALLAPICCOLA (Thursday) As Continuum's overview will show, this composer balanced innovation and links to earlier traditions. His music has disappeared to an alarming degree since his death in 1975, but when his music turns up, it invariably invites further exploration. This installment of the Composer Portrait series is your best chance. Included is a selection of works that run from the 1940's (''Rencesvals,'' the Sonata Canonica and ''Due Studi'') through 1970 (''Sicut Umbra''). 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $20; $12 for students.

(Eichler) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today, tomorrow and Thursday) The Philharmonic has made a big deal of paying tribute to Elliott Carter this season, but its performances of his works are so few and so widely spaced that you've probably forgotten about it. Not to worry: this week, Lorin Maazel and the orchestra get to one of Mr. Carter's true classics, the Variations for Orchestra, along with works by Brahms and Kodaly and, with Gil Shaham, Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1. On Thursday, Robert Spano takes over for the premiere of John Harbison's ''Milosz Songs,'' with Dawn Upshaw as the soloist, as well as works by Bartok and Bernstein.

(Holland) * 'LA PASIÓN SEGÚN SAN MARCOS' (Monday and Tuesday) ''Fasten your seat belts'' was one insider's advice at the Brooklyn Academy of Music a few years ago when this lionized piece by the composer Osvaldo Golijov had its New York premiere. A recasting of a Bach Passion for the South American vernacular, this ''Pasión'' is certainly approachable and stirring, and Mr. Golijov's biggest popular success -- if not perhaps as ground-breaking as many seem to think. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $65. (Midgette) * MARGARET LENG TAN (Tomorrow and Sunday) John Cage's 1944 score-painting, ''Chess Pieces,'' disappeared into a private collection soon after he wrote it, so when the pianist Margaret Leng Tan first saw it, last year, she knew she had a virtually unknown Cage work to perform. It wasn't that easy: the painting is a chessboard made of score shards, and Ms. Tan's job was to determine how those fragments were meant to fall together. She is playing the work, along with Vittorio Rieti's ''Chess Serenade'' and Michael Nyman's ''Pawn to King Four,'' as part of the Anthology Film Archives' ''Chess and Surrealism'' program. 8 p.m., Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 979-1027 ; $12. (Kozinn) * CHRISTIAN TETZLAFF (Wednesday) This exceptional 39-year-old German violinist does not have the name recognition of some other soloists or the marketing muscle behind his career, but the depth and sensitivity of his playing have rightly made him a favorite among critics and connoisseurs. This week, he is joined by the pianist Lars Vogt in a promising program of all three Brahms violin sonatas. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $45. (Eichler) 'VoiceS OF LIGHT' (Tonight) Richard Einhorn composed this vivid, unusual oratorio as a soundtrack for Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic ''The Passion of Joan of Arc,'' a compressed telling of Joan of Arc's trial by an ecclesiastical court and of her execution by being burned at the stake. It is to be performed by the Ensemble Sospeso, the New Amsterdam Singers, and Anonymous 4, which assembles only for special projects these days. 8, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Kozinn) VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) George Steel and his superb chamber choir turn their attention to Jacobus Vaet, an obscure Flemish Renaissance master. This program of Vaet's sublime sacred music is filled out with works by Clemens Non Papa and Nicolas Gombert. 8 p.m., Church of St. Paul the Apostle, Columbus Avenue at 60th Street, (212) 854-7799; $35; $21 for students. (Kozinn) Dance Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance. * CARRIE AHERN (Thursday) Ms. Ahern describes her new ''Red,'' inspired by Margaret Atwood's ''Handmaid's Tale'' and by the clean lines of the performance space, as a ''work of beautiful suffocation.'' Her all-female ensemble includes some of the city's most interesting dance artists. (Through Feb. 26.) 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15. (Jennifer Dunning) RICHARD ALSTON DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) The choreographer Richard Alston has been a mainstay of English contemporary dance since the early 1970's, and his musical, often understated work is always worth watching. This program presents three dances new to New York audiences: ''Fever,'' to Monteverdi; ''Such Longing,'' to Chopin's Nocturnes and Études; and ''Gypsy Mixture,'' from the delightfully titled CD ''Electric Gypsyland.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800 or www.joyce.org; $38. (Roslyn Sulcas) JULIO BOCCA'S BOCCATANGO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Bocca and his Ballet Argentino celebrate the tango in two performances in the New York City area this weekend.

(Claudia La Rocco) GINA GIBNEY DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Gibney explores the worlds of finite reality and the unknowable, and she has made a third new world of them in her mysterious, subtle ''unbounded.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday night at 7:30. , Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194 or www.danspaceproject.org; $15.

(La Rocco) SARA EAST JOHNSON'S LAVA (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Johnson's award-winning, all-female company, LAVA, presents ''(w)HOLE'' (short for ''The Whole History of Life on Earth''), its first new work since 2003. Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7, Sunday at 5 p.m., Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, www.TheaterMania.com; $20 to $25. (Erika Kinetz) BILL T.

(La Rocco) JUILLIARD SCHOOL: 'NEW DANCES/NEW MUSIC' (Wednesday and Thursday) New dances by Adam Hougland, Jessica Lang and Alan Hineline to new music by Christopher Rouse, Pete M. Wyer and Jerome Begin, conducted by Andrea Quinn. (Through Feb. 26.) 8 p.m., Juilliard Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $20; $10 (at box office) for students and 65+. (Dunning) * KINGS OF THE DANCE (Thursday through next Sunday) Conceptually yet another ripoff of the Three Tenors, this program upon closer inspection looks a little more interesting than that. It offers Angel Corella and Ethan Stiefel of American Ballet Theater, Johan Kobborg of the Royal Ballet and Nikolay Tsiskaridize of the Bolshoi Ballet, joined by Alina Cojocaru and others from the Royal Ballet. There will be new choreography by Christopher Wheeldon, Roland Petit, Nils Christie, Stanton Welch and Tim Rushton, along with solos by Balanchine, Grigorovich, Petipa and Bournonville, and Fleming Flindt's complete ''Lesson,'' in which each king will dance the role of the teacher on successive nights. Thursday through Feb. 25 at 8 p.m., Feb. 26 at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.citycenter.org; $35 to $150. (John Rockwell) ROMULO LARREA TANGO ENSEMBLE (Tonight) Three tango-dancing couples, and music by Carlos Gardel and Astor Piazzolla. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 and $37.50. (Dunning) SUSAN MARSHALL AND COMPANY (Wednesday) Ms. Marshall celebrates her company's 20th anniversary with her new ''Cloudless,'' a variety show, she says, of ''short, punchy, poem-sized pieces.'' (Through Feb. 25.) 7:30 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, corner of Valley Road and Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112; $35.

Daily, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077.

(Dunning) * NEW YORK FLAMENCO FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Performing this weekend will be Cristina Hoyo's Ballet Flamenco de Andalucia (tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Compania Antonio el Pipa with the guest performers Mariana Cornejo, Concha Vargas and Juana del Pipa (Sunday at 7 p.m.) City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org or www.flamencofestival.org; $30 to $65. (Dunning) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL: SALLY-ANNE FRIEDLAND DANCE DRAMA COMPANY (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Tel Aviv-based Sally-Anne Friedland Dance Drama Company makes its United States debut. The South African-born Ms. Friedland danced with the Batsheva and Bat-Dor companies, but her own work is (according to the press materials) inspired by Carolyn Carlson and Pina Bausch. In her world premiere of ''Borders'' and the American premiere of ''Red,'' we are promised that ''the abstraction of dance meets the drama of life.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org/HarknessFestival; $20; students and 62+, $15. (Sulcas) BETH SOLL & COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Soll will present ''Mortal Angels,'' a dance (Ms. Soll) and video (Bryan Hayes) piece inspired in part by the image of a hidden child angel. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 924-7882; $12. (Dunning) MAXINE STEINMAN & DANCERS (Wednesday, Thursday, Feb. 25 and Feb. 26) The 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Festival continues with a program that includes two premieres, one a collaboration between Ms. Steinman and her husband, the sculptor Alfredo Cardenas, and the video artist Tom Ruth. Wednesday, Thursday and Feb. 25 at 8 p.m., Feb. 26 at 2 and 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 415-5500; $20; students and 62+, $15. (La Rocco) SUMMERFEST '06: BATOTO YETU (Wednesday) This free series -- what more do you need than palm trees for an early summer -- continues with music, dance and storytelling by bust-a-gut child performers. 12:30 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505 or www.worldfinancialcenter.com.

Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109 or www.theaterforthenewcity.net. Evening performances: $10.

(Dunning) REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces which the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and commerce,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) Galleries: Uptown Boyd & Evans: Color in Black and White' This husband-and-wife team from England makes large landscape and cityscape photographs in which all but selected central images have been drained of color. The best pictures, like that of the rusty brown tank standing all by itself in the midst of a black and white desert, are more strange and dreamy than gimmicky. Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 439-1700, through Feb. 25. (Ken Johnson) Robert S. Neuman: 'Fifty Years' With good humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through March 4. (Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Norman Ballard: 'Standing Waves' A theatrical lighting designer and veteran laser light artist presents recent compact sculptures in which fine, colored laser lines rhythmically swing or rotate through colored liquids in glass containers. Framed by rugged metal elements, the sculptures combine industrial-strength materialism and the hypnotic appeal of the lava lamp. Bryce Wolkowitz, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 243-8830, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) EIRIK JOHNSON: 'BORDERLANDS' Small, serendipitous encounters in the landscape are the subjects of Eirik Johnson's large color photographs: junk hung picturesquely on a wire fence along a shore; a red sweater splayed between trees in a woods; a fragile, impromptu bridge of skinny longs laid across a creek. In one photograph, a huge crumple of grayish fabric plopped on grass and maybe used as a shelter has the imposing look of a sculptural boulder. There are no control-freak setups here. Rather, it seems that Mr. Johnson helps the camera make its own discoveries, often with poetic results. Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Feb. 25. (Glueck) Sarah Pickering: 'Explosions' Winner of the 2005 Jerwood Photography Award, Ms. Pickering presents large and lush photographs of exploding bombs incongruously set off in pastoral settings as part of law enforcement training programs. Daniel Cooney, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 255-8158, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) ALEX SOTH: 'NIAGARA' Love and romance play tackily in these photographs of small town young people, while the nearby falls of Niagara provide a grand symphonic background. Mr. Soth's lens lingers on cheap motels that serve as wedding and honeymoon settings, people awkwardly dressed in celebration clothes, a purple-prose letter conveying declarations of the heart. On a grungy street an unglamorous mother stares unbeguilingly at the camera while cradling an infant. Mr. Soth, whose antecedents would seem to include the faux-vernacular photographs of William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, intersperses these shots with glorious scenics of the eternal Falls, doing their thing above and beyond local happenings. Ho, hum. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street (212) 741-1111, through Feb. 25. (Glueck) * TRIFECTA This energetic curatorial face-off consists of three exhibitions devoted to young artists (nearly 20 in all) organized by the gallery's owner, Becky Smith, and her assistants, Esme Watanabe and Erica Samuels. The three groupings progress from minimal to hyper-real, with Ms. Watanabe's selection, which lands somewhere in the middle, edging out those of her colleagues. Sara VanderBeek's set-up photographs, which suggest a Surrealist's garret, are a find. Bellwether, 194 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Feb. 25. (Smith) Johannes Wohnseifer: 'New Alphabet' Paintings and sculptures in several different styles by this brainy young German conceptualist obscurely explore semiotics relating to industrial, military, political and popular-entertainment spheres. He has a keen sense of design, and the sculptures made of pieces of shiny bent metal and thick felt are extremely elegant. But over all, his project looks like that of an academic theory wonk. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, (212) 645-7335, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo * BEC STUPAK/HONEYGUN LABS: 'RADICAL EARTH MAGIC FLOWER' This ambitious gallery debut centers on a blind remake of Jack Smith's 1963 orgiastic ode to transvestism and Hollywood camp, ''Flaming Creatures,'' projected on a wall opposite the original, with Ms. Stupak's subtitlelike storyboards appearing in between. The contrast is mutually enhancing up to a point; the Stupak provides color and detail missing from the blurry, black-and-white Smith film, but the earlier effort still carries the day. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, (212) 343-7300, through Feb. 25. (Smith) * ZILVINAS KEMPINAS In contrasting works, the artist uses videotape to create one environment and record another. The resulting Op Art installation and the bike ride through Times Square conspire; sensory overload, both retinal and aural, ensues, as does a surprising application of the less-is-more principle. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through Feb. 25. (Smith) Other Galleries Carla Accardi and Lucio Fontana: 'Infinite Space' Bridging the gap between higher metaphysics and raw materialism in Italy in the 1960's and 70's, Fontana famously made single-color canvases that he decisively slashed or punctured, while Accardi wrapped strips of painted transparent plastic around wooden stretchers or painted fields of optically vibrating calligraphy. A selection of works by both artists makes for a surprisingly handsome and elegant show that is nicely complemented by a small installation of recent works by Richard Tuttle in the project room. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. Granted that much of Downtown was throwaway stuff, too ephemeral and experimental to last; for better or for worse, it helped to change the definition of what art and artists might be. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) * HOME STORIES: AN INSIDE LOOK AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES IN AUSTRIA Departing from standard-issue architectural exhibitions with a slightly too clever design, this show of 21 recent houses includes portraits of their inhabitants and poster-size sheets free for the taking that function as both labels and catalog. The totality feels like a collaboration among Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and the contemporary photographer of your choice, but it makes an excellent case for the vitality of Austrian architecture. Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through Feb. 25. (Smith) * 'Speak: Nine Cartoonists' Original drawings and studies by nine of the best comic book artists in the business, including R. Crumb, Daniel Clowes, Gary Panter, Chris Ware and Art Spiegelman. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778. Through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Last Chance * Ellen Brooks: Vintage Photographs from the 70's Cultural wars have come and gone -- actually, they've never really gone -- since 1976, when Ellen Brooks first showed a dozen larger-than-life-size studio photographs of nude male and female adolescents. Eight more pictures, never before exhibited, from the same series are on view at Roth, and it is easy to see how, in the right (meaning wrong) setting, they could still cause a fuss today. The inclusion of documentation, including early reviews of the work, give these remarkable pictures a historical context. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067; closes tomorrow. (Cotter) WILLIE COLE: SOLE TO SOUL An adept recycler of found objects used as tools or in assemblages to evoke different varieties of African sculpture, Mr. Cole has expanded both palette and references in his latest efforts. Here women's high heels, arranged by hue, handsomely evoke rose windows, mandalas and lotus flowers, as well as religious multiplicity (Smith). Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 367-7474; closes tomorrow. (Smith) The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400; closes Sunday. (Cotter) Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. (See above.) 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639; closes Sunday.(Johnson)"

Theater Approximate running times are in parentheses. Theaters are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/theater. Previews and Openings '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Opens Sunday. This New York Musical Theater Festival hit is a satirical musical about several artists racing to finish a musical in three weeks. Apparently, they got it done (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Opens Monday. Dead pets, severed limbs, black Irish humor -- Martin McDonagh (''The Pillowman'') is up to his old tricks in this devilish comedy about terrorism and torture (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. 'DEFIANCE' Opens Tuesday. Set on a Marine Corps base during the 1970's, John Patrick Shanley's new play, his first since ''Doubt,'' revolves around an explosive incident between an African-American marine and a white one. Doug Hughes directs (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. 'HEDDA GABLER' Opens Tuesday. Cate Blanchett (''The Aviator'') stars as Ibsen's unhappy heroine, who returns from her honeymoon to discover that her marriage is one big bore. A Sydney Theater Company production (2:25). Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON' Opens Wednesday. A new play about Simone de Beauvoir, concentrating on her affair with the novelist Nelson Algren. Uses details from her published letters and the novel ''The Mandarins'' (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'BERNARDA ALBA' Opens March 6. The Tony winner Phylicia Rashad (''A Raisin in the Sun'') plays another formidable matriarchal figure with an iron will in Lincoln Center Theater's musical version of Lorca's '' House of Bernarda Alba.'' Michael John LaChiusa, who already has one musical to his name this season, ''See What I Wanna See,'' contributes music and lyrics (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. 'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Opens March 16. Alec Baldwin stars in Joe Orton's jet-black comedy about a handsome stranger who seduces everyone else onstage (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. 'FAMILY SECRETS' Opens March 8. Sherry Glaser plays her entire family in this revival of her 1993 autobiographical solo show about moving from the Bronx to Southern California (1:30). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. 'GREY GARDENS' Opens March 7. Maybe the biggest question mark of the musical season, this intriguing show is an adaptation of the cult documentary about the eccentric relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (2:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' Opens March 5. The resourceful Pearl Theater tries to provide an answer to this problem play (2:30). Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. 'MEASURE FOR PLEASURE' Opens March 8. A new play by David Grimm (''Kit Marlowe'') that is part Restoration comedy, part modern sex comedy (2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. 'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' Opens March 6. This artistic hybrid by Wallace Shawn and his brother, Allen, is a drama about the making of an opera that features -- are you still following? -- operatic flashbacks (1:50). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. 'RING OF FIRE' Opens March 12. Johnny Cash hits form the backbone of this musical about three couples. So far, it's received surprisingly good buzz. Richard Maltby Jr. directs (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 'SIDD' Opens March 15. Herman Hesse's novel ''Siddhartha,'' the musical version (2:15). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Broadway 'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Charles Isherwood) 'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway * 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'ACTS OF MERCY: PASSION-PLAY' If there is a coherent story to Michael John Garcés' ''Acts of Mercy: passion-play,'' it is resolutely kept from the audience. As the efforts of two brothers to reconcile with a dying father progress, it seems possible that viewers are meant to discern the consequences of family trauma from punchy monosyllabic combat and repeated expletives, but their efforts to connect are continually frustrated (2:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, west of Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Honor Moore) * 'ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL' This Theater for a New Audience production inspires a quiet prayer of thanks to the theater gods. Here is that rare Shakespeare production in which there is nary an incompetent, misjudged or ineffective performance in a significant role. Darko Tresnjak and his cast find a way to make the play's troubled romance, between the adoring Helena and the disdaining Bertram, psychologically credible and even touching (2:30). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'CLEAN ALTERNATIVES' Brian Dykstra's improbable comedy details the good fight fought by a businesswoman turned environmental activist taking on a toxin-spreading megacorporation. The play also depicts the moral transformation of a rapacious lawyer into a love-smitten puppy dog. Call it a fairy tale for our time (2:00). 59E59 Theaters , 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'CONFESSIONS OF A MORMON BOY' Steven Fales, a sixth-generation Mormon, describes leaving his family and becoming a gay escort in this fairly conventional, although admittedly compelling, piece of confessional theater (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Jason Zinoman) 'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'I LOVE YOU BECAUSE' The plot line -- single New Yorkers in search of love -- couldn't be more familiar, but somehow this fluffy, funny musical makes it refreshing, helped along by an engaging six-member cast, with David A. Austin making a particularly hilarious impression. An impressive start for Ryan Cunningham (book and lyrics) and Joshua Salzman (music), both still in their 20's (2:00). Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street, near Sullivan Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Neil Genzlinger) 'RED LIGHT WINTER' A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, the play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'THE RIGHT KIND OF PEOPLE' Satire sans teeth by Charles Grodin about internecine warfare within a Fifth Avenue co-op board. Directed by Chris Smith, the show has the embarrassed air of someone who has just been served a choice steak and misplaced his dentures (1:30). Primary Stages, at 59E59, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley) * 'THE SEVEN' The wild ride of luckless ol' Oedipus -- accidentally offing Dad, marrying Mom, being dissed by the kids -- gets pimped to the nines in this frisky and funny new riff on the classic story. Written by Will Power and directed by Jo Bonney, the show is a freewheeling adaptation of one of the more static, less revered Greek tragedies, Aeschylus' ''Seven Against Thebes'': a hip-hop musical comedy-tragedy (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) * 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway 'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright (Yussef El Guindi) addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after 9/11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) '25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Phoebe Hoban) * 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley) Long-Running Shows * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway?

Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'DECEMBER FOOLS' Sherman Yellen takes a stab at the letters-in-a-drawer play (old letters are discovered, and lives are changed), and things get off to a promising start: a New York matron's disgruntled daughter finds some of Mom's old screeds and turns them into weapons. But the play is too long, and some dandy comedy is undercut by some tired melodrama (2:15). Abington Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. ( Genzlinger) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing Saturday. (Zinoman) 'JUMP/CUT' Neena Beber's play about an aspiring filmmaker's effort to document his best friend's illness limns despair while leaving the audience exhilarated -- by the fierce beauty of Ms. Beber's writing, and by a captivating performance by Luke Kirby as the brilliant, charismatic, darkly funny manic-depressive whose inescapable fate is the central mystery of the work (2:10). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton; closing Sunday. (212) 239-6200. (Miriam Horn) * 'LENNY BRUCE IN HIS OWN WORDS' Jason Fisher does an impressive facsimile of this legendary comic in a nostalgic greatest-hits collection of his stand-up routines (1:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman) 'LENNY & LOU' This black comedy by Ian Cohen about two brothers and their foul-mouthed, demented mother has the right ingredients for shock theater: four-letter words, sex talk, sex acts. But it somehow doesn't shock (2:15). 29th Street Rep, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday.(Genzlinger) * 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the archmanipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closing Sunday.

Access Theater, 380 Broadway, north of White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closing Sunday. ( Zinoman) 'REAL BLACK MEN DON'T SIT CROSS-LEGGED ON THE FLOOR' The poet and playwright Malik's series of quick, interwoven scenes tracing the lives of African-American men in America, mainly in the last half century, can pack an emotional punch, but it works better as a showcase for some outstanding performances by its eight-member cast than it does as a theater piece (2:00). New Federal Theater, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983; closing Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 'BATTLE IN HEAVEN' (No rating, 94 minutes, in Spanish) An alternatingly mesmerizing and off-putting story about sex, class, God, soccer, an ugly man, a beautiful woman, a dead baby, the dirt below them and the wide sky above. The talented Mexican director Carlos Reygadas (''Japón'') strives to say something about his country, to tap into the spiritual and material desperation of its people, but doesn't seem especially committed to his material. (Manohla Dargis) 'BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE 2' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Martin Lawrence is back in fat-lady drag in this inconsequential sequel for undemanding moviegoers. Mr. Lawrence makes the most of the incongruity of a manly F.B.I. agent posing as a nanny in floral-print dresses, but the humor doesn't go much beyond oversize underwear and a tequila-drinking dog. (Anita Gates) * 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden) * 'CACHÉ (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott) * 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens) 'DESERT WIND' (No rating, 80 minutes, in French) In March 2004, the Swiss documentary maker François Kohler took 13 men -- Canadian, French, Swiss and Belgian -- on a two-week trek in the Tunisian Sahara. The group was accompanied by a Swiss psychotherapist, as well as by a team of Tunisian guides with pack camels. The purpose of the trip: to stage a kind of men's encounter group in the desert, encouraging the participants to break away from received notions of masculinity and to talk about their desires, anxieties and deepest fears. Though it generates its share of unintentional giggles, ''Desert Wind'' does manage to take us to a seldom-visited place: the hidden corners of the straight male mind. (Stevens) 'FINAL DESTINATION 3' (R, 92 minutes) It's more dead teenagers and lunatic determinism in this grim third installment of the enjoyably preposterous ''Final Destination'' franchise. (Nathan Lee) 'FIREWALL' (PG-13, 100 minutes) A thrill-challenged thriller starring Harrison Ford and directed by Richard Loncraine that manages to entertain mildly only because it traffics in all the familiar action-movie clichés, giving filmgoers ample opportunity to test their action-movie I.Q.'s. (Dargis) 'FREEDOMLAND' (R, 113 minutes) This inept, lethally dull drama directed by Joe Roth and written by Richard Price, from his novel, involves a white child who may have gone missing in a New Jersey public housing complex, where the residents are all black. A loud Samuel L. Jackson and a miscast Julianne Moore star. (Dargis) 'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) * 'LOVE' (No rating, 93 minutes) Cool, mysterious and defiantly foreign, ''Love'' plays out on the immigrant fringes of an indifferent New York City. A Yugoslavian hit man, his German ex-wife and her cop boyfriend form a love triangle that propels a cosmopolitan cast into a violent game of cat and mouse. In these bleak, isolated neighborhoods, exquisitely shot by the Serbian cinematographer Vladimir Subotic, love and politics are inseparable and the gleam of Manhattan is a million miles away. (Jeannette Catsoulis) * 'MANDERLAY' (R, 138 minutes) To warm to ''Manderlay,'' the chilly second installment of the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier's yet-to-be-completed three-part Brechtian allegory examining American history, you must be willing to tolerate the derision and moral arrogance of a snide European intellectual thumbing his nose at American barbarism. Those willing to endure his scorn are in for a bracing satire of the legacy of slavery in the United States. (Holden) * 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott) 'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden) 'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis) * 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis) 'NANNY McPHEE' (PG, 99 minutes) In the endearing but somewhat scatterbrained British film ''Nanny McPhee,'' Emma Thompson creates an indelible character reminiscent of the pre-Disney Mary Poppins working benign magic to shape up an unruly brood of children. (Holden) 'PINK PANTHER' (PG, 92 minutes) Steve Martin steps into the shoes of Peter Sellers in this intermittently witty revival of a vintage comedy franchise. Though finely honed, Mr. Martin's portrayal of the idiotic French police inspector Jacques Clouseau can't match Sellers's viscerally funny one. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'ROVING MARS' (G, 40 minutes) Mars. IMAX. If you want to grow up to be an astronaut, prepare to bliss out. (Lee) * 'SOPHIE SCHOLL: THE FINAL DAYS' (No rating, 117 minutes, in German) The gripping true story of Sophie Scholl, an anti-Nazi student activist arrested and executed for distributing leaflets at Munich University, challenges you to gauge your own courage and strength of character should you find yourself in similar circumstances. (Holden) * 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott) 'TAMARA' (R, 98 minutes) Low in budget as well as ambition, this ''Carrie'' knockoff is a movie of few innovations but one genuine surprise: the inability of the title character, an evil sorceress, to manage in high heels. (Lee) 'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the movie rise above its indie road-picture clichés. (Scott) * 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott) 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned über-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Catsoulis) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) 'A YEAR WITHOUT LOVE' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Spanish) Anahí Berneri's debut film recounts in uncomfortable close-up the day-to-day activities of a youngish gay writer from Buenos Aires afflicted with AIDS, who becomes involved in S-and-M. Based on the diaries of the real Pablo Peréz (he is also co-writer of the script), the film reveals rare insight into the endurance and treatment of illness, but is never fully arresting. (Laura Kern) * 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turnoff. (Dargis) Film Series DOCUMENTARY FORTNIGHT EXPANDED (Through March 13) The Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of contemporary nonfiction films runs five weeks this year. This weekend's films include Paul Rosdy's \"New World\" (2005), about what was once the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Karen Kramer's \"Ballad of Greenwich Village\" (2005), an affectionate profile of a neighborhood. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400; $10.

On Sunday night, the comedian and writer Paul Mooney will present highlights from ''The Richard Pryor Show'' (1977, NBC), Mr. Pryor's very short-lived television series. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $12. (Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. AKIM FUNK BUDDHA (Tuesday) The American-born, Zimbabwe-raised Akim Ndlovu, who performs as Akim Funk Buddha, creates theatrical mash-ups involving dance, poetry, music and storytelling. 8 p.m., Tribal Soundz, 340 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 673-5992; free. (Laura Sinagra) BELLE & SEBASTIAN, THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS (Thursday) The deceptively gentle Scottish rock of Belle and Sebastian continues to find the exquisite balance between loll and lash. The New Pornographers are a revved-up Vancouver outfit whose smart constructions and tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until Neko Case's voice cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. 8:30 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $30 (sold out). (Sinagra) BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Thursday) Boasting zero members from Brazil and only one girl (the multilingual surrealist jazz singer Sabina Sciubba), this downtown quartet plays its erotic, electronica-inflected reggae and bossa novas on keyboards, computers, bass and drums. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20.. (Sinagra) GEORGE CLINTON & THE P-FUNK ALLSTARS (Tuesday) George Clinton's long-running band has become an American institution, using funk to subvert and outflank any Puritan reflexes. The band is large enough to be a party all on its own, with ranks of guitarists, singers, horn players and keyboardists to pump out songs that encompass decades of American musical history. As P-Funk's leisurely jams amble from bubbling-mud funk to slow-grinding blues-rock to bits of doo-wop, jazz and hip-hop, the music is tight and loose at the same time. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, $37.50; $42 at the door.

(Sinagra) DONALD FAGEN (Wednesday) Steely Dan's jaded-jazz rocker Donald Fagen tours in support of his first solo record since 1993, ''Morph the Cat'' (Reprise), on which, among other things, he focuses his recognizable leer on a hot airport security babe. 8 p.m., State Theater, 15 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 246-7469; $45 to $65. (Sinagra) FLOOK, KARAN CASEY BAND (Tonight) This Irish music bill begins with the traditional Celtic stylings of Flook, a band featuring flute, bodhran, accordion, guitar and bouzouki. The second section presents the vocalist Karan Casey. 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26; 12 and under, $22; students, $15. (Sinagra) HOWE GELB (Tomorrow) Howe Gelb, the songwriter at the core of Giant Sand, applies his scratchy voice to songs that can sound quiet and offhand or go lurching and twanging toward chaos. 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $12 . (Pareles) JOHN HAMMOND (Thursday) The rural blues tradition of polyrhythmic fingerpicking and casually revealing vocals is being upheld by revivalists like John Hammond, who has been playing country blues since the 1960's . He's a virtuoso whose songs, mostly classic blues, are feats of down-home intricacy. 8 p.m., Makor, 35 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 601-1000; $18 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles) SARAH HARMER (Wednesday) In the tradition of emotionally astute Canadian singer-songwriters, Sarah Harmer applies her sharp voice to bluegrass-tinged pop and wistful folk. 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 941-8100; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sinagra) HOWLIN' FOR HUBERT (Tomorrow) The blues guitarist Hubert Sumlin's electric guitar style, evidenced on Howlin' Wolf classics like ''Killing Floor,'' influenced pretty much every classic rock heavyweight from Clapton to Zappa. Here he plays with the New York Dolls frontman David Johansen and the former Band drummer Levon Helm. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $30. (Sinagra) BILLY JOEL (Tomorrow, Monday, and Thursday) Last year, the iconic piano man released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real, if prickly, confidence and false bravado in both his playing and his delivery that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 to $89.50. (Sinagra) TED LEO & THE PHARMACISTS (Thursday) The Irish-American indie rocker Ted Leo plays soulful punk, nearly popping a neck vein for political justice. But his melodic sensibility and sudden falsetto also recall the melodic 1970's arena-rock of bands like Thin Lizzy. 8:30 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Columbia Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007; $15 (sold out). (Sinagra) TANIA LIBERTAD (Tomorrow) This Peruvian singer, who has made Mexico her home for 20 years, specializes in boleros but incorporates other Latin American styles as well. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536; $25 to $40. (Sinagra) VUSI MAHLASELA (Thursday) Vusi Mahlasela was one of the most important songwriters of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, not just for his political courage but also for his sterling voice and for three-chord rockers that make earnest sentiments bounce. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Pareles) PAPOOSE, DJ PREMIER, SADAT X (Tonight) The Brooklyn rapper Papoose, a traditionally minded lyricist and keeper of the battle rhyme flame, has been doing the mixtape thing for a while now, but has been getting more attention lately. He is joined here by the New York rap stalwarts DJ Premiere and Sadat X. 9, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $17 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra) ARIEL PINK (Tonight) With a mind like a radio antenna, this California home-recording maven has made hundreds of bedroom-rock creations melding snippets of half-remembered strains into an often charming clamor. On this tour, he's using local bands in each city as his backup crew. Here it will be the noise-rock band Excepter. 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra) RAKIM, SAIGON (Monday) One of hip-hop's most commanding MC's, Rakim did his best work with DJ Eric B. in the late 1980's and early 90's, but his cool, confident flow is still one to beat. The socially conscientious rapper Saigon has gotten a push by playing himself on the television show ''Entourage.'' 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Sinagra) PONCHO SANCHEZ (Thursday through March 5) The conga player Poncho Sanchez plays a funky brand of salsa. 8 p.m., and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; $20 at the bar, $35 at tables. (Sinagra) STEVE RILEY AND THE MAMOU PLAYBOYS (Tonight) The accordionist Steve Riley leads one of the best bands from the Louisiana bayous. It reaches back to some of the oldest Cajun tunes while adding its own to the repertory, in arrangements that find gleaming new combinations of fiddle, triangle and guitar. The songs, with bayou stubbornness, are in Cajun French. 7:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200; $20. (Pareles) RJD2, ACEYALONE, BUSDRIVER (Sunday) Representing an offshoot of the crate-digging DJ tradition exemplified in the 1990's by the likes of DJ Shadow, RJD2 takes a cinematic approach. He has produced the soulful, dramatic ''Magnificent City'' (Project Blowed/Decon) for the rapper Aceyalone, who applies his sonorous voice to, among other things, the subject of greed. 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sinagra) SPANISH HARLEM ORCHESTRA (Tonight through Sunday) Anyone who's heard a salsa band in New York City has probably seen some of the members of the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, which recaptures the golden age of 1970's salsa. This full-length club engagement should give these virtuosos a chance to dig deep into the music. 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592; $20 at the bar, $30 at tables.

(Sinagra) THE STROKES (Wednesday) Six years ago, with its exaggerated Tom Petty jitters and rich hipster slumming, this band convinced fatigued late-1990's clubbers that rock was back.

(Stephen Holden) BABY JANE DEXTER (Tomorrow) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; cover, $20, with a $15 minimum.

(Chinen) * CACHAO (Tuesday and Wednesday) In the 1940's, Israel Lopez, known as Cachao, helped define modern Cuban music, especially with respect to the bass; now in his 80's, he has wisdom to match his panache, as he'll demonstrate here with a 10-piece band. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $45 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'AIDA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) The Amato Opera's reputation is that it conveys the spirit of, and a love for, Italian opera, though the full impact is impossible to achieve in a 102-seat theater with a cast that changes at every performance. And against the odds, all the principals at a recent performance of ''Aida'' managed to make it through to the end, demonstrating a true love of the piece if not always of the pitch. It's a unique experience. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette) 'DARKLING' (Sunday through Tuesday, and Thursday) American Opera Projects' latest venture is a three-week run of this multimedia opera, which brings together extremely diverse composers -- Lee Hoiby and Stefan Weisman -- and performers, from singers to the alternative Flux Quartet. The subject: the Holocaust. Tuesday is opening night. Sunday afternoon at 3; Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 8; East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; $30 to $45.(Midgette) 'LA FORZA DEL DESTINO' (Tonight and Tuesday) It's tempting to say that ''Forza'' has the most numbingly ludicrous libretto of any Verdi opera, but with such stiff competition, who can truly say? Giancarlo del Monaco's drab staging, first seen in 1996 and hidden away in storage since then, offers little help, but the Met does have a vocally solid cast, with Deborah Voigt, Salvatore Licitra and Mark Delavan. Gianandrea Noseda conducts. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175.(Allan Kozinn) 'LAKMÉ' (Sunday) Delibes's ''Lakmé'' is best known for the coloratura soprano tour-de-force aria ''The Bell Song'' and an utterly dreamy duet for soprano and mezzo-soprano. But these days audiences do not often get to hear this once-popular opera complete. So it's good news for opera buffs that Eve Queler, a tireless champion of neglected works, will conduct a concert performance with the Opera Orchestra of New York. Eglise Gutiérrez, a young Cuban-born soprano whose career is taking off, sings the title role, with a cast that includes a young Armenian tenor, Yeghishe Manucharyan, and the veteran bass James Morris. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $125. (Anthony Tommasini) 'ROMÉO ET JULIETTE' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The big news from the Met's new production of this Gounod opera is the French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay. Singing with uncanny agility and lyrical elegance, she touchingly embodies the tragically impulsive young Juliette. The tenor Ramón Vargas, though a stiff actor, delivers a vocally impassioned Roméo. Guy Joosten's production evokes the look of Renaissance Italy, though with surreal touches and too much heavy-handed imagery of eternal love amid the starry cosmos. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $150 remaining tickets tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini) 'SAMSON ET DALILA' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The Met's color-coded production of this Saint-Saëns opera, by Elijah Moshinsky, takes on Olga Borodina as Dalila.

(Bernard Holland) 'LA TRAVIATA' (Monday) Angela Gheorghiu continues her star turn in the title role. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out. (Holland) Classical Music BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) A weekly presenter of chamber music concerts, this floating concert hall also offers great views of Lower Manhattan. Unfortunately, the roster of regular players seems to have shrunk of late. This weekend, the barge's executive director, Mark Peskanov, has again programmed himself and his colleagues as performers. This weekend, Mr. Peskanov and company play music by Mozart, Schubert, Shostakovich and Beethoven. Thursday, Allison Eldredge (cello) and Max Levinson (piano) perform Beethoven, Bartok and others. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing, next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Jeremy Eichler) ALFRED BRENDEL (Monday) As this eminent Austrian pianist settles into his golden years, he seems quite content to focus on the Viennese Classical works that have been the core of his repertory. For his Carnegie recital he offers Schubert's lengthy and reflective late Sonata in G (D. 894), and Mozart's brooding Fantasy in C minor and melancholic Rondo in A minor. But if this sounds rather pensive, fear not: he will bracket these works with performances of two high-spirited and witty Haydn sonatas. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Tommasini) BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) The news is Michael Christie, the new music director of an orchestra that established a tradition of hot young music directors with Robert Spano. Mr. Christie gets raves from people who have encountered him; his opening concert includes the world premiere of a new ''Fanfare'' written for the event by John Corigliano, and Orff's ''Carmina Burana,'' as well as works by Stravinsky and Philip Glass. 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60. (Midgette) CAPPELLA ANDREA BARCA (Tomorrow) Like so many of his piano-playing colleagues, Andras Schiff takes up conducting as well in this all-Mozart program. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $97. (Holland) CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) The acclaimed pianist Angela Hewitt is known above all for Bach and French music; her programs with the Chamber Music Society this weekend focus on the French, with pieces ranging from a Ravel trio to the Franck quintet. She also joins the young German cellist Daniel Müller-Schott for the Debussy cello sonata. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49 (Midgette). JERUSALEM CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Wednesday and Thursday) Chamber music festivals, increasingly, are ensembles that come together for an intense couple of weeks and then go on the road. The pianist Elena Bashkirova founded this one in 1998, and it's been an occasional guest at Carnegie Hall, where this year its programs include Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony and a healthy admixture of Mozart. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $40. (Midgette) I MUSICI (Sunday) This venerable Italian orchestra offers an all-Mozart program that includes the ''Serenata Notturna,'' the Piano Concerto No. 14 in E flat with Stephen Hough, the Divertimento in D (K. 136) and ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.'' 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $56.

(Kozinn) NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) Robert Spano brings his energy and imagination to a New York Philharmonic program including Bartok, Harbison and Bernstein and featuring the soprano Dawn Upshaw. 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94. (Holland) NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY (Sunday) Paul Haas conducts ''The Other Rainbow'' by Roger Zare and Stravinsky's challenging ''Rite of Spring.'' 2 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $7 to $55. (Holland) PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA (Tuesday) For all reports, Christoph Eschenbach, now in his third season as music director, has had a shaky relationship with the Philadelphia players. Still, he is a comprehensive musician, and the orchestra is capable of doing great work with him. Longtime fans of this illustrious orchestra should be curious to hear this program, with the New York premiere of Esa-Pekka Salonen's ''Insomnia'' and Beethoven's ''Pastoral'' Symphony. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $99. (Tommasini) * POMERIUM (Sunday) Alexander Blachly's early-music choir is a mainstay of the Music Before 1800 series, and of early-music life in New York generally.

(Kozinn) DAVID ROBERTSON YOUNG ARTISTS CONCERT (Tomorrow) In addition to presenting concerts, Carnegie Hall also runs numerous professional training workshops every year. This week, the conductor David Robertson and his colleagues have been working intensively with young musicians from around the country to prepare them in a program of challenging scores by Messiaen (''Sept Haïkaï'' and ''Oiseaux Exotiques'') and Varèse (''Déserts''). Under Mr. Robertson's baton, the workshop participants will show what they've learned. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15. (Eichler) * JORDI SAVALL (Thursday) If you aren't convinced of the persuasive power of the viola da gamba, then you probably haven't heard Jordi Savall play it. There will be several opportunities this season, starting with this recital of works by Sainte-Colombe, Marais, Bach, Hume, Ferrabosco and others. 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $38. (Kozinn) TAKACS QUARTET (Tonight) Bartok has long been a specialty of this quartet, which offers the Bartok Second as the centerpiece of a program that opens with Schubert's Quartet in A minor (D. 804) and closes with Mozart's Quintet in C (K. 515), with James Dunham joining to play the extra viola part. 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $44 and $52. (Kozinn) LES VIOLONS DU ROY (Sunday) This spirited chamber orchestra is based in Quebec City and led by the able Canadian conductor Bernard Labadie. And while the group plays on modern instruments, its repertory often leans toward the Baroque. Here, it will perform Jean-Fery Rebel's ''Élémens,'' a suite from Rameau's ''Dardanus'' and arias by Rameau and Gluck. The Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena, a frequent presence in New York in recent weeks, returns to Carnegie as the guest soloist. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $42 and $55.

(Through March 5.) 8:30 p.m., West End Theater, 263 West 86th Street, (212) 337-9565; $10 and $12. (Dunning) TRAJAL HARRELL AND KAREN BERNARD (Tonight and tomorrow) Chosen by Tere O'Connor, these two choreographers will present a dance that unfolds like a diary (Bernard), and a piece that incorporates postmodern dance, fashion runway moves and vogueing (Harrell). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11, and www.thekitchen.org.; $10. (Dunning) BILL T.

(Dunning) * KINGS OF THE DANCE (Tonight through Sunday) While conceptually yet another copy of the Three Tenors, this program, on closer inspection, looks more interesting than that. It offers Angel Corella and Ethan Stiefel of American Ballet Theater, Johan Kobborg of the Royal Ballet and Nikolay Tsiskaridize of the Bolshoi Ballet. There will be new choreography by Christopher Wheeldon, Roland Petit, Nils Christie, Stanton Welch and Tim Rushton, along with solos by Balanchine, Grigorovich, Petipa and Bournonville, and Flemming Flindt's complete ''Lesson,'' in which each ''king'' (except for Mr. Stiefel, with his tender knees) will dance the role of the teacher on successive nights. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 3 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.citycenter.org; $35 to $150. (John Rockwell) * REJINA NEJMAN & COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Nejman's ''Velocity of Things,'' in which six characters trapped in a futuristic carnival search desperately for balance in a fast-paced world, won the FringeNYC's 2005 Outstanding Choreography Award. 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479; $18; $15 for students and 65+; T.D.F. accepted. (Dunning) * NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday) The winter season ends this weekend.

(Rockwell) NICHOLASLEICHTER DANCE WITH THE BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) Mr. Leichter, long known on small stages for his energetic, multicultural physicality, has choreographed his first opera: Carl Orff's ''Carmina Burana.'' The program, which celebrates Michael Christie's inaugural season as music director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, also includes a world premiere of John Corigliano's ''Fanfare'' and works by Igor Stravinsky and Philip Glass. 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music Howard Gilman Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100 or www.bam.org; $20 to $60; students, $10. (Kinetz) 92ND STREET Y HARKNESS DANCE FESTIVAL: HEADLONG DANCE THEATER (Wednesday and Thursday) From Philadelphia, Headlong presents a preview of a new dance based on a short story by I. B. Singer, and the New York premiere of ''Mixed Tape for a Bad Year,'' a suite of short dance and a film that reflects the emotional toll of 12 months of disasters, war and political bitterness. (Through March 5.) 8 p.m. Ailey Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Manhattan (212) 415-5500 and www.92Y.org/harknessfestival; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) PAPPA TARAHUMARA (Thursday) This performance group makes its New York debut with ''Island,'' a tragic, multidisciplinary adaptation of Gabriel García Márquez's story ''A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings.'' (Also March 3.) 7:30 p.m., Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258 or www.japansociety.org; $30; members, $25. (Kinetz) * PAUL TAYLOR (Tuesday through Thursday) Having celebrated a milestone anniversary last year, the Paul Taylor Dance Company begins its ''next 50 years of greatness'' with its annual three-week season at City Center. The opening-night gala with live music is on Tuesday and includes one of the season's two New York premieres, ''Spring Rounds,'' set to Richard Strauss's arrangements of Couperin. The programs otherwise offer the typical mixture of Taylor standards and exotica. Tuesday at 7 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m. Through March 19.City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or www.nycitycenter.org; $15 to $80; some gala seats, especially if dinner is included, are more expensive. (Rockwell) PEGGY SPINA TAP (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Spina celebrates 25 years of performing, choreographing and teaching tap in a program of dances set to music performed live by the Joel Forrester Quartet. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 6 and 8:30 p.m., Spina Loft, 115 Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 674-8885; $20. (Dunning) VISION COLLABORATION NIGHTS (Tonight through Sunday) In three different programs, work will be presented by 10 modern-dance choreographers set to live music by their collaborators, ending with an improv jam featuring most of the dancers. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 5 p.m., 14th Street Y Theater, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 696-6681 or www.visionfestival.org; $20. (Dunning) REGGIE WILSON/FIST & HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. Wilson and his superb musicians and dancers create a world that fuses the cultural traditions of the black American South, urban America, Africa and the Caribbean, this time in ''The Tale: Npinpee Nckutchie and the Tail of the Golden Dek,'' a new work that explores sexual attraction. 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077; $25; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning) Art Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. Museums * AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hard-wired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith) * Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh, color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith) * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter) JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Félix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc, her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein) Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average life span was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever-present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness were shots in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 or so objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter) * MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck) * MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. It also includes a large selection of prints -- many ingeniously adapted from his oils -- that played an important role in his art. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Glueck) THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff) The Museum of Modern Art: JOHN SZARKOWSKI: 'PHOTOGRAPHS,' through May 15. A kind of homecoming, this beautiful show surveys the pictures taken by Mr. Szarkowski before and after his influential 29-year term at the helm of the Modern's photography department. The best show him combining the styles of the photographers he has long admired with his native ground -- the architecture and landscape of the upper Midwest. (See above.) (Smith) * P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter) * Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) Galleries: Uptown Robert S. Neuman: 'Fifty Years' With good-humored generosity and a skillful, sensuous touch, Mr. Neuman has painted his way through several different genres over the course of his five-decade career, including Abstract Expressionism, geometric formalism, funky allegorical narrative and painterly landscapes that mourn the losses of the American Indians. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through March 4. (Ken Johnson) Galleries: 57th Street * 'RON NAGLE AND THE HOLY GRAIl' Nominally, the 12 absurdly beautiful little ceramic objects that make up Mr. Nagel's eighth New York solo show are teacups. But an exquisite combination of sculptural form, color, surface and craftsmanship elevates each to a transcendental realm of pure aesthetic contemplation. They are smart and slyly humorous, too. Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through Feb. 25. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea Caitlin Atkinson: 'Chapters' Comical and touching staged photographs portray the artist herself in moments of anxiety and disappointment: contemplating a dish of lasagna she burned; apparently abandoned in an empty grocery store parking lot; and starting to disrobe at a nude beach. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through March 4. (Johnson) Chuck Close, Annie Leibovitz, Vik Muniz: 'Inventive Fashion Photographs' Photographs of the silhouettes of fashion models, shaped in bent wire and based on fashion photographs by Vik Muniz; daguerreotype pictures of a naked Kate Moss; and fashion spreads by Annie Leibovitz based on ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Danziger, 521 West 26th Street, (212) 629-6778, through March 4. (Johnson) Mimi Smith: 'Drawings from the 60's to the Present' Known for witty feminist sculptures based on women's clothing, Ms. Smith here presents drawings sampling her five-decade career, including a large, three-dimensional paper house covered with fine writing protesting environmental pollution and recent sets of finely made images of shoes and underwear representing stages in a woman's life from infancy to old age. Kustera Tilton, 520 West 21st Street, (212) 989-0082, through March 4. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo 'Space Boomerang' This darkly theatrical show includes sculptures like Cubist bathtubs by Mike Bouchet; a bicycle with endlessly spinning wheels by Jonathan Monk; a Minimalist wall sculpture dented on purpose by Bruno Peinado; a wall that intermittently vibrates violently by Loris Gréaud; a magical light and smoke sculpture by Ann Veronica Janssens; a video documenting Gianni Motti's walk through a particle accelerator; a motorcycle immersed in the wax of burning candles by Mark Handforth; and a long, sleek wall of black plastic-shaded lights by Lang/Baumann. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through March 9. (Johnson) Other Galleries Joe Bradley: 'Kurgan Waves' Large, blocky men assembled from flimsy, brusquely painted canvases seem to have convened for a mysterious tribal ritual in Mr. Bradley's sharp sendup of Minimalist orthodoxy. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, between Hester and Canal Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through March 4. (Johnson) * 'Do You Think I'm Disco' There's a big story to be told about disco culture of the 1970's, which had roots in rhythm and blues, African-American church music, 1960's drug culture, gay liberation and all manner of anti-establishment politics. This modest group show touches on all of these elements, however glancingly and unsystematically, by considering the trickle-down effect of discomania on some new art today. Longwood Art Gallery@Hostos, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, (718) 518-6728, through March 18. (Cotter) * 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her deathbed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck) * Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson) 'Site 92' The second exhibition in this nonprofit gallery's impressive big, new space presents site-specific works by more than 25 artists. Highlights includes a colorful column of hovering butterflies made of candy wrappers by Luisa Caldwell; fanciful architectural elements painted on the wall by Amy Yoes; people imitating the sounds of pigeons in an audio-video work by Beth Krebs; and, by Virginia Poundstone, a tableau representing a satellite that has crashed in the jungle. Smack Mellon, 92 Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 834-8761, through March 5. (Johnson) Last Chance * HOME STORIES: AN INSIDE LOOK AT SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES IN AUSTRIA Departing from standard-issue architectural exhibitions with a slightly too clever design, this show of 21 recent houses includes portraits of their inhabitants and poster-size sheets free for the taking that function as both labels and catalog. The totality feels like a collaboration among Bernd and Hilla Becher, Felix Gonzalez-Torres and the contemporary photographer of your choice, but it makes an excellent case for the vitality of Austrian architecture. Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300: closes tomorrow. (Smith) 'I Love My Scene' This intriguing and puzzling exhibition organized by José Freire, director of Team Gallery, includes photographs of movie stars and models by Cecil Beaton; pictures of murder and accident victims by Weegee; faux-antique architectural studies drawn by Pablo Bronstein; and large sculptures by Keith Sonnier, Banks Violette and Lothar Hempel. Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 752-2929; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) EIRIK JOHNSON: 'BORDERLANDS' Small, serendipitous encounters in the landscape are the subjects of Eirik Johnson's large color photographs: junk hung picturesquely on a wire fence along a shore; a red sweater splayed between trees in a woods; a fragile, impromptu bridge of skinny logs laid across a creek. In one photograph, a huge crumple of grayish fabric plopped on grass and maybe used as a shelter has the imposing look of a sculptural boulder. There are no control-freak setups here. Rather, it seems that Mr. Johnson helps the camera make its own discoveries, often with poetic results. Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-0370; closes tomorrow. (Glueck) * ZILVINAS KEMPINAS In contrasting works, this artist uses videotape to create one environment and record another. The resulting Op Art installation and a record of a bike ride through Times Square conspire; sensory overload, both retinal and aural, ensues, as does a surprising application of the less-is-more principle. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3455; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * 'Speak: Nine Cartoonists' Original drawings and studies by nine of the best comic-book artists in the business, including R. Crumb, Daniel Clowes, Gary Panter, Chris Ware and Art Spiegelman. Pratt Manhattan Gallery, 144 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 647-7778; closes tomorrow. (Johnson) * BEC STUPAK/HONEYGUN LABS: 'RADICAL EARTH MAGIC FLOWER' This ambitious gallery debut centers on a blind remake of Jack Smith's 1963 orgiastic ode to transvestism and Hollywood camp, ''Flaming Creatures,'' projected on a wall opposite the original, with Ms. Stupak's subtitlelike storyboards appearing in between. The contrast is mutually enhancing up to a point; the Stupak provides color and detail missing from the blurry, black-and-white Smith film, but the earlier effort still carries the day. Deitch Projects, 76 Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300; closes tomorrow. (Smith) * TRIFECTA This energetic curatorial face-off consists of three exhibitions devoted to young artists (nearly 20 in all), organized by the gallery's owner, Becky Smith, and her assistants, Esme Watanabe and Erica Samuels. The three groupings progress from minimal to hyper-real, with Ms. Watanabe's selection, which lands somewhere in the middle, edging out those of her colleagues. Sara VanDerBeek's set-up photographs, which suggest a Surrealist's garret, are a find. Bellwether, 194 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959; closes tomorrow. (Smith) Johannes Wohnseifer: 'New Alphabet' Paintings and sculptures in several different styles by this brainy young German conceptualist obscurely explore semiotics relating to the industrial, military, political and popular entertainment spheres. He has a keen sense of design, and the sculptures made of pieces of shiny bent metal and thick felt are extremely elegant. But over all, his project looks like that of an academic theory wonk. Casey Kaplan, 525 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 645-7335; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)"

Actors who worked with him almost universally deferred to him as a comedic grandmaster, yet his characters were not jokers but the butts of jokes. He was absolutely flappable. No one had a better tremor or double-take, and with his unmistakable homeliness -- bulging eyes, receding chin, stooped shoulders, broad hips -- he didn't bother to play the wise fool; he wisely stuck to just the fool. Of Barney Fife, Mr. Knotts's character on ''The Andy Griffith Show,'' Billy Bob Thornton said, ''Don Knotts gave us the best character, the most clearly drawn, most perfect American, most perfect human ever.''"
