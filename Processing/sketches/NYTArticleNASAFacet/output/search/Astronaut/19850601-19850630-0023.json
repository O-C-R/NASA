Books are arranged alphabetically under subject headings. Quoted comments are from The Book Review. AUTOBIOGRAPHY & BIOGRAPHY AUGUST STRINDBERG. By Olof Lagercrantz. Translated by Anselm Hollo. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.50.) ''A wonderful biography, worthy of a maddeningly foolish, wrong and presciently wise writer who was one of the prime inventors of our theater and our time,'' by a Swedish poet, critic and editor. THE CHIEF: A Memoir of Fathers and Sons. By Lance Morrow. (Random House, $16.95.) The relationship between Lance Morrow, a successful journalist, and his father, Hugh, a top aide to Nelson Rockefeller, is explored with ''clear-eyed candor and writing skill that reveal both passion and confusion.''"

Details of the venture on the space shuttle are to be disclosed during the visit of the Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, to Washington and to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. The visit by the Indian leader is designed to ease strains with the United States, reach a series of space and technology agreements and open a nationwide cultural program, the Festival of India. A highlight of the visit, Administration officials said, will be a series of announcements on joint efforts in space, science and technology. These include plans to put an Indian payload specialist on the space shuttle next year and the launching of a satellite on the same mission that is partly designed to expand the uses of radio and television in Indian villages."

The shuttle is scheduled to take off at 7:33 A.M. Monday with seven crew members, including a Saudi Prince. Plans call for the crew to release four satellites into orbit. The missile defense test is scheduled for Wednesday, when a low-powered laser in Hawaii is to bounce its beam off a special mirror that will be mounted on a window of the Discovery. The goal is to see if computers on the ground can adjust the laser beam to counteract the distorting effects of the earth's turbulent atmosphere."

Among the highlights are ''With Her Face to the Sea,'' a program of songs and stories of the sea - from the Revolution through the age of steam - scheduled for the Old South Meeting House on July 5 from 8 P.M. to 10 P.M. and on July 6 from 4 P.M. to 6 P.M. and from 8 to 10. Admission is $10, $6 for children under 12. The 17th century will be re-created on July 7 from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. on Thompson Island, where a dialect performance of the Plimoth Plantation's trading expedition's negotiations with Boston's first trader, David Thompson, will be re-enacted."

Nabih Berri, the Shiite Moslem leader, whose militia has assumed a major role in the hijacking, said he had ordered the passengers to be taken off for what he called security reasons. He said the hostages were being held ''somewhere in Beirut.'' [Page A1, Column 6.] The key to the hostages' fate is held by Nabih Berri, the Reagan Administration told him. It insisted that the United States would make no concessions to the gunmen who took the Americans prisoners when they hijacked the T.W.A. jetliner Friday, and that it would not ask Israel to release Shiite prisoners to meet the hijackers' demands.

The test had been scheduled as the first shuttle experiment to help develop arms for President Reagan's proposed defensive shield against enemy missiles. The error in the Discovery's navigational instructions caused the winged spaceplane to be turned 180 degrees in the wrong direction. The laser beam struck the craft, but on the opposite side from the mirror meant to bounce the beam back to an Air Force ground station atop a mountain on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Outburst From Critics Several critics quickly cited the failure as evidence of bigger problems to come. They said this mistake, a simple human error capable of upsetting a complex technological effort, was the type that could be the ultimate undoing of the proposed antimissile shield."

Fabian, 46 years old, of the Air Force, as the observatory drifted away."

Knifing through the darkness from the Air Force Optical Station on Maui, the beam of low-powered light hit an eight-inch mirror on the side of Discovery 220 miles overhead as the winged spacecraft traveled at more than 17,000 miles an hour, several hundred miles an hour faster than a speeding warhead. In Wednesday's unsuccessful trial of the laser system, faulty instructions from ground control inadvertently resulted in their mirror pointing at deep space instead of toward the incoming beam as it struck the ship. Today the light found its intended target. The mirror bounced the beam back to earth, sending data that enabled scientists to adjust the laser in order to counteract the distorting effects of the turbulent atmosphere, keeping the beam locked on the shuttle. ''We have the target in sight,'' Col. John M. Fabian, a mission specialist aboard Discovery, reported to ground controllers as he viewed the laser beam. ''It's bluish green. It pulsed for a while and locked on steady for short periods.''"

Rather, it has to do with perfecting methods for the commercialization of space. By the turn of the century, the area just outside the earth's atmosphere is expected by to be laden with orbiting factories for manufacturing drugs, alloys, crystals and other high-technological materials and products, according to aerospace analysts. They say they expect the proceeds from the ventures to amount to billions of dollars every year."

      "lead_paragraph": "PHOTOGRAPHED in black and white, it looks like an extraterrestrial contraption and may well retain a special-effects look when viewed at night. In reality. the object, installed at cornice level in the Castelli Gallery, 420 West Broadway, is Dan Flavin's latest - two 32-foot-long rows of fluorescent bars in pink, yellow, blue and green. Both arranged in this chromatic order, the upper row consists of four long bars, the lower of 16 short ones. In this installation, Flavin doesn't explore, as he usually does, the properties peculiar to fluorescent, whereby a bar of one color can be manipulated to cast the glow of another. The piece is, rather, a relatively artless celebration of primary hues for their own sake, each reflected in the polished surface of the gallery's parquet floor, and collectively they bathe the white walls with only faintly perceptible tints. Some sculptors harbor a desire to see children scrambling over their work; if Flavin is one of them, he would have been pleased to see the children that were crawling ecstatically around the floor during the reviewer's visit, supplying the ''performance'' that the lights seem to promise."

Ferraro, whose Democratic Vice-Presidential candidacy last year provoked a sharp debate on the abortion issue, said here today that the right of women to choose an abortion ''is inseparable from our struggle for political and economic independence.'' Sharing a platform with an astronaut, an Olympic athlete and a civil rights activist, all women, Mrs. Ferraro criticized ''male-dominated, conservative religious groups'' that she said wanted to make ''our decision for us.'' Mrs. Ferraro, the first woman nominated for Vice President by a major political party, came under attack in last year's campaign from anti-abortion activists and some religious leaders for her position on the issue."
