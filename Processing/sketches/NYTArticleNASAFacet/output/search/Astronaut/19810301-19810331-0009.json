When the doctors looked at Earvin Johnson's surgical left knee and decided he could return to the Los Angeles Lakers Feb. 20, Jerry Buss, who owns Johnson's smile and his knee, looked at the schedule and decided to wait another seven days. He waited because, on the Laker calendar, the box for Feb. 27 was in yellow, which means a home game. Inside the box, Buss saw the letters ''N.J.'' The New Jersey Nets. A sellout. A happening. A breeze. At the end of an evening that Buss called semipainful, the Lakers' owner laughed nervously. ''It didn't exactly work out that way,'' he said. The plan did not include the fact that, after missing 45 games, or more than half a season, Magic Johnson would have to help the Lakers win a game last night."

This year, INTERPEX heralds even more: the first great undertaking of man in space since the landings on the moon. The 1981 stamp show is built around the imminently scheduled flight of the Space Shuttle - or Space Transportation System, as the whole assemblage of the versatile space freighter is known. The United States has scheduled for next month a set of eight Space Achievement stamps, keyed to the shuttle, a revolutionary spacecraft that makes all others obsolete and is basic to future developments in space. Simulated exhibits of the Space Shuttle, its elements and its voyage -realistic and often close to actual size - have been provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other Federal agencies. The exhibits are described as being so dramatic that they will even make enthusiastic stamp collectors stop to look while scurrying to see the dealers' booths."

But in the two astronauts' last formal appearance before the scheduled launching of Columbia, one of them predicted that the flight likely would not go its scheduled distance of 36 revolutions of the earth in 54 1/2 hours. ''I think the odds, with the way we've designed the mission right now, are that we'll probably come home early,'' said Capt. Robert L. Crippen of the Navy, who will be making his first flight into space. The commander of the flight is John W. Young, a veteran astronaut who has been into space four times and walked on the moon once. They are scheduled to be launched from Cape Canaveral early in the week of April 5 and to glide to a controlled landing, airplane-style, at Edwards Air Force Base in California later that same week."

If Mr. Blackard or his co-workers were to drop so much as a coin from their perches hundreds of feet high, it could result in devastating damage to the $9 billion shuttle. Tethering loose objects is just one of the innumerable precautions that have become second nature for the team. Driving 30 miles to work from his home in Geneva, Fla., Mr. Blackard, wearing a sport shirt and visored cap, is indistinguishable from other rush-hour commuters or vacationers. But after showing his badge at various checkpoints inside the vast space center, he becomes one of 18,000 men and women who are racing the clock to complete preparations for the maiden flight of the shuttle, which is scheduled for the week of April 6. His employer, Martin Marietta Aerospace Corporation, built the shuttle's huge external fuel tank, and flaws in the tank must be repaired quickly if the shuttle is to lift off next month."

As corporate managers become Government leaders, nowhere is the gravity of their change greater than in their new relationship with, and responsibility to, the news media. Yet media relationships are rarely mentioned in their briefing books, and their attitudes are perhaps irreparably warped by the often-stated (and overstated) warning that the Washington press corps is predatory, or worse. I recall one lawyer-turned-staffer brightly alerting an official heading for a news conference that ''the alligators are waiting.''"
