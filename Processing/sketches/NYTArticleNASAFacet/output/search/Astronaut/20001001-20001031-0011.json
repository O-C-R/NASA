''Except for all the parts that are true.'' It's a late summer afternoon, and Mr. Ritchie is taking a break from preparations for his forthcoming show at the nearby Andrea Rosen Gallery, helping a visitor unravel fact from fiction in his sprawling artistic program. At first glance, Mr. Ritchie's ambitious paintings, drawings and installations seem to illustrate an impenetrable personal cosmology. Yet they're built on a rigorous system of real-world information, ranging from theoretical physics and molecular biology to medieval alchemy and classical philosophy. According to the artist, it's just the beginning of a continuing project designed to function as nothing less than ''a map of everything.''"
