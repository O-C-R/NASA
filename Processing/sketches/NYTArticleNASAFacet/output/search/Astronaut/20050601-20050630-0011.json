Griffin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, told the House Science Committee yesterday. It may sound like a recipe for trouble, or worse, especially since the work left undone includes three of the most critical recommendations of the board that investigated the loss of the Columbia in 2003, including elimination of the kind of launch debris that doomed the Columbia and the development of on-orbit repair techniques."
