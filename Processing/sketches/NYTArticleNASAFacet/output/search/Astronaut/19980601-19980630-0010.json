There will be excitement, but uncertainty as they plant themselves on the Delta Center floor in Salt Lake City for Game 1 Wednesday in a land that might as well be another planet this year. The Utah Jazz has changed, from the climate of its confidence to the topography of its mind-set. This is not the same Jazz team that was at first awestruck before stretching Chicago to six games in last year's National Basketball Association finals. And this is not the same swaggering Bulls team that typically enters the finals with all the advantages of the upper crust. They still have Michael Jordan, but the Jazz holds the home-court advantage."

Brown Jr., ''is when you take rookies into space and you see their face after the main engine shutdown and you're in orbit. You never forget that.'' In October, if all goes as planned, Colonel Brown will fly his fifth shuttle mission with one crew member who may have that same look, not from the novelty of the experience but from distant memory. If Charles Lindbergh had climbed into a cockpit two years before Ronald Reagan became President, he would have been 77, the age John Glenn will be when he makes his second spaceflight. Indeed, to understand the peculiarity of this flight, it helps to do one more piece of math: we are now further away in time from Glenn's first mission than that mission was from Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic."
