      "lead_paragraph": "Today marks the 70th anniversary of the most lopsided game in American football history, Georgia Tech's 222-0 demolition of a rag-tag squad from Cumberland College of Lebanon, Tenn., and only one of the victors is alive to tell about it. He's George Griffin, who played quarterback for the 1916 Rambling Wrecks before extending his Tech career in the posts of assistant football coach, mathematics instructor, assistant dean of students, dean of students (1946-64) and now dean emeritus. Griffin, not surprisingly, is known around campus as Mr. Georgia Tech, and this Thursday he has another anniversary to celebrate. It's his 90th birthday, and the school is throwing a big bash that evening in the Griffin Ballroom of the Alumni-Faculty House. Bobby Dodd will be there, and invitations have also gone out to such alumni as Jimmy Carter, Senator Sam Nunn, the astronaut John Young, and Rear Adm. Richard Truly, director of the space shuttle program."

Pending final approval of the Transportation Department, Texas Air plans to begin service to some of Frontier's routes as early as Nov. 1.
