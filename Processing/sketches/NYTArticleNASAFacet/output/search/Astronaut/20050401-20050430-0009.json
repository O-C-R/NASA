The small box held several dozen snapshots a fan had sent to Ms. Taylor sometime back in the 1970's. The accompanying letter had been lost, the fan's name long forgotten. Enriching the mystery were the photographs themselves: bizarre shots of parrots and cockatoos dressed in tiny people costumes, staged in miniature theater sets with handmade props. In one, a pair of parrots on little motorcycles recreated an iconic image from ''Easy Rider.'' In another, a cockatoo in a gold jacket posed with what was literally a baby grand piano, evoking Liberace. There were parrots playing baseball, parrots boxing, parrots portraying Bonnie and Clyde and Sonny and Cher. Parrots dressed up as Patton, Custer, Madame Butterfly and, in a strange act of cross-species cross-dressing, a parrot Mickey Mouse."

      "lead_paragraph": "Each afternoon , usually around 4, the sun beams directly onto the disco ball perched on the living room mantel of Alexandre de Betak's Paris apartment, producing a spray of shimmying lights. ''It's the happy hour chez Betak-Marnay,'' says Betak, who recently transformed what he describes as ''a typical bourgeois apartment'' in the 16th Arrondissement into a colorful aerie for himself; his wife, the model and actress Audrey Marnay; and their two young sons, Amaël and Aidyn. But spend some time chez Betak-Marnay, and you quickly realize that there is a never a dim moment. While the apartment receives a fair amount of natural light, de Betak has set every corner of every room ablaze. Lights crowd the shelves, the tables, the floor -- every outlet is a snarl of electrical cords. (And yes, the renovation included rewiring.) Some of the lights are sculptures, like the Gianfranco Fini composition of Plexiglass rods jutting through a black field, or ''La Luna,'' Paola Pagani and Carlo Pellegrini's bisected sphere. Others are toys, like the marshmallowy Barbapapa that glows cheerfully in the boys' room; still others are relics of disco days past. ''When I was a teenager, we would have these boum parties,'' says de Betak, who grew up attending the popular dance gigs in Paris. He points to a cluster of multicolored headlights:"

Happy screeches from fans who clearly remembered the band from its 1980's heyday greeted the five members as they arrived onstage in the dark and stood side by side, fully confident that they'd be illuminated by camera flashes. They were. It's a semi-reunion for Duran Duran, whose hitmaking lineup ruptured in 1985 when its drummer, Roger Taylor, and its guitarist, Andy Taylor, left the band. The singer Simon LeBon, the keyboardist Nick Rhodes and the bassist John Taylor (none of the Taylors are related) kept making Duran Duran albums, with diminishing returns, until the two other Taylors returned in 2003."

During a simulated landing on April 6, the altimeter reading had the space shuttle cruising on approach to the runway at 4,000 feet below sea level. Sims are serious business: they are carefully designed tests that throw realistic problems at crews and build the reflexes that could save lives. The faulty altimeter reading was an error that could have ruined the exercise. Without any sign of frustration or irritation, but with a large dose of astronaut-issue composure, Col. Eileen M. Collins, the shuttle's commander, said simply, ''That was a brand-new one,'' and completed the landing sequence."

The other members seemed intent on whisking Dr. Griffin through as fast as possible so that he could take the helm of the space agency as it prepares to resume shuttle flights. There is little doubt that the agency needs a firm hand at the top as it struggles to rebound from the Columbia tragedy, and Dr. Griffin, who has held a variety of jobs in the aerospace industry, looks eminently qualified."

So on Saturday, for the first time since the terrorist attacks of 2001, NASA threw open the gates of its 1,600-acre campus at the Johnson Space Center here in Clear Lake, restoring a festive annual tradition and offering a close-up look at the business of sending men and women into the cosmos. With security tight, NASA did little to publicize the event, but some 30,000 visitors streamed in, a testament to close ties in this community, a onetime sailing village long since swallowed up by Houston, where astronauts are the folks you see shopping at the Baybrook Mall or hoisting one at the Outpost after work."
