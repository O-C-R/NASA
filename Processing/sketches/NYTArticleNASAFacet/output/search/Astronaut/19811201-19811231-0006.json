Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration disclosed the plan Wednesday in discussing the future of the shuttle before the Senate Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. The flight, to be made in 1983, will be an early demonstration of the shuttle's satellite servicing capabilities while in orbit and will revive a payload of great value to solar scientists around the world."

By Seymour Topping The Soviet TU-154 airliner soars over the snowcapped wastelands of Central Asia and settles upon a yellow, grassland plateau. An official car carries us from the small airport past grazing horses, cattle and yaks; beside tiny wooden houses and the conical, tentlike dwellings - wool felt stretched on pine frames - known as yurts; over the Tola River, already glistening with a sheen of ice on this October day, and on into a wide valley. Suddenly, the skyline of a modern city juts above the horizon: High-rise apartment houses in pastel shades, swaying construction cranes, spewing factory smokestacks. We have arrived in Ulan Bator, a city of 400,000 people and the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic. Men and women in traditional long, padded gowns tied with silk sashes share crowded sidewalks with modish young women in smart, Western-style leather jackets and high-heeled boots. A lone Buddhist lama in saffron robes hurries past strolling Russian soldiers on leave from posts on the Chinese frontier."

Some were said to prefer keeping out of politics, while others favored a hard line with the unions. Several are seasoned veterans of combat."

That is noteworthy, as is the fact that it is being presented by Robert Brustein's American Repertory Theater, for 34 performances in repertory through March 14. And for a third claim to fame, the production is by the enfant terrible of New England opera and theater direction, Peter Sellars. ''Orlando'' is full of beautiful, psychologically true and formally daring music, and it should be said right away that the musical performance here is of the highest quality. The opera is presented virtually complete, with nearly three hours of music. The 14-member pit band under Craig Smith's direction plays with style, spirit and accuracy."
