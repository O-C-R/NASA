By listening to the figures' instructions and those of actors serving as guides, visitors are coaxed to collect the elements of a code, a la Indiana Jones, that will gain them entrance to a ''secret'' tomb."

Among the many talents of the director, John Lasseter, and his huge crew of computer-animation pioneers is a gift for making their work look easy. Only after leaving the theater is there reason to realize just how much imagination has gone into making this film so enveloping. While its surface is as smooth and witty as that of ''Toy Story'' itself, the sequel and its characters (in the words of an associate technical director) are ''probably twice as complicated under the hood.''"
