''A lot of people in town just don't want it here, or at least not the way it is now.''

In their first postflight news conference at Houston, the astronauts also answered several questions about their landing March 30 at White Sands Missile Range, N.M. Their mission, the third test flight of the shuttle, lasted eight days. Col. Jack R. Lousma of the Marine Corps, the flight commander, said that the landing gear only seemed to be lowered a breathtaking instant before touchdown. Actually, he said, the wheels came out five miles farther away from the touchdown point than they had on previous landings. But the craft was coming in lower than the astronauts realized, a characteristic of final approaches controlled by automatic systems, and faster, presumably a result of the thin highaltitude air and wind conditions."

At issue are a $285,000 mural by James Rosenquist chosen for a concourse of Miami's airport used by Eastern Airlines and a $500,000 commission to Beverly Pepper for a sculpture that would stand at the entrance to the seaport. Both works were selected by committees of the Dade County Art in Public Places program, which has operated since 1973 under a county ordinance requiring that 1.5 percent of the construction costs of public buildings be spent on art objects. The Rosenquist mural, ''Star Thief,'' a 17-foot by 46-foot melange of contemporary images presenting the artist's impression of space flight - bacon strips, a sliced mannequin's head, a sprocket, a grid and other sundries, all adrift in an intergalactic flow - drew fire from Frank Borman, the former astronaut who now heads Eastern, which is based in Miami. He wrote to the Dade County Board of Commissioners not only deriding the work but also complaining about the money spent for it in a time of economic recession. ''I have had some exposure to space flight, and I can tell you without equivocation, there is not, in my mind, any correlation, spiritual or material, between the artist's depiction and the real thing,'' Mr. Borman said."

And there is a large picture of a large polar bear who bears no resemblance whatsoever to his friendly southern cousin, Smokey. Few tourists get up here, 2,400 miles northwest of New York City, to the northern end of commercial aviation lines in North America. For one thing, it costs twice as much to get here from Toronto as it does to go to Europe. But no visitor gets away from this little outpost without hearing tales of the town's grumpy bear neighbors whose large paws can remove a seal's head with one swipe."

BY REGINALD STUART As the space shuttle Columbia successfully completed its third test flight last month, space fever was stirring once again in millions of Americans. For space buffs unable to wait for commercial flights, a day in Huntsville, Ala., may prove almost as exciting. It sounds like an odd suggestion at first, but in Huntsville one finds the Alabama Space and Rocket Center, the largest space museum on earth. (There are smaller exhibits at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and Kennedy Space Center in Florida.) Huntsville is also home of the Marshall Space Flight Center, the largest facility of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), where the specialty is the development of rocket propulsion systems."
