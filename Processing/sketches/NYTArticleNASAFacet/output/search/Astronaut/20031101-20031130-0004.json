If NASA had recognized early on that the shuttle had been damaged at liftoff, the report said, it could have ordered the seven Columbia astronauts to conserve oxygen by minimizing all physical activity. The astronauts would have slept 8 hours a day, or maybe 12, and could have survived in orbit four weeks, instead of two."

For one thing, when he died, roughly at age 46, he was traveling at 10,500 feet through a high pass in the Tyrolean Alps, near the current border between Italy and Austria."

One was a program of Spanish music by Spanish students at the Manhattan School of Music; the other was an evening of three one-act plays by Horton Foote by second-year students at the Atlantic Theater Company Acting School. Both programs gave considerable pleasure; young talents abounded. What struck me, however, beyond all the gifted individuals, was their sheer numbers. All the time, all over Manhattan and the country and the world, there are similar performances of well-trained, gifted and ambitious young people, all making art. What will become of them?"
