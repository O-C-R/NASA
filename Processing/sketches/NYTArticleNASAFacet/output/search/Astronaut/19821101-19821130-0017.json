This state, for example, elected an all-Republican Congressional delegation in 1980, and the party had reason to believe it could make inroads this year into state government, long dominated by Democrats. Instead, the Democrats now are within reach of placing a liberal in a new Congressional seat, of unseating Senator Harrison Schmitt, the former astronaut, and of winning the Governor's office with a flamboyant Hispanic candidate who is considerably to the left of the retiring Governor, Bruce King, a Democrat. Whether the Democrats succeed is expected to depend to a large extent on the turnout of Hispanic voters, even though this vote has been diluted by affluent whites arriving in recent years from other states."

Schmitt, the Republican Senator who first gained fame 10 years ago as an astronaut who walked on the moon, was defeated today by his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Jeff Bingaman. The loss by the 47-year-old Mr. Schmitt was widely interpreted here as a verdict on both the Reagan economic and environmental programs, which he backed strongly, and on the Senator's negative campaign against his 39-year-old opponent. With 76 percent of the state's 1,231 precincts reporting, the laconic, reserved Mr. Bingaman had 167,651 votes, or 52 percent, to Mr. Schmitt's 154,021 votes. The turnout was extraordinarily heavy, about 70 percent, state elections officials said. Early reports said that voting was exceptionally high in the normally Democratic precincts in Albuquerque and the northern part of the state."

The Columbia is carrying two communications satellites for the project's first two paying customers, Satellite Business Systems Inc. and Telesat Canada. The planned five-day mission will also feature the largest astronaut crew, two pilots and two mission specialists, and the first ''space walk'' by Americans since 1974. The three and a half hour extravehicular activity, as it is known formally, is set for Sunday morning."

Brand In the final moments of his last trip into space, Vance Devoe Brand, commander of the current flight of Columbia, was made unconscious for almost a minute by noxious nitrogen tetroxide fumes that were sucked into the cabin. The incident occurred on the descent from an otherwise flawless nine-day mission in 1975 in which an Apollo spacecraft made a successful rendezvous with a Soviet Soyuz. Mr. Brand and the other two Apollo astronauts, Maj. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford of the Air Force and Donald K. Slayton, were hospitalized for three days. The descent was unusually noisy with much radio static and excessive sound from the jet thrusters and the rush of air around the capsule. At 30,000 feet, in the midst of all this, Mr. Brand failed to hit two switches. One would have turned off the thrusters that controlled the spacecraft's attitude in space, which were unnecessary in the atmosphere. It was gas from the thrusters that entered the cabin. The other switch was to activate the automatic system that deployed the spacecraft's parachutes."

The satellite, Canada's Anik C-3, sprang free of the shuttle as the astronauts coasted over the Pacific Ocean on their 22d orbit. Spinning for the sake of stability and cloaked in a multitude of dark blue solar cells, the cylindrical satellite drifted miles away before its rocket fired to raise it toward a higher orbit over the Equator. Dr. Joseph P. Allen, who supervised the operation, reported its success in a voice rising with excitement."

The first two such specialists, Joseph P. Allen, a 45-year-old physicist, and William B. Lenoir, a 43-year-old electrical engineer, are directing all ''onorbit'' activities - carrying out the practical chores, now that the craft has been placed in orbit by the pilots."

First, the speech denounced ''attempts to impose American diktat ... .'' A spokesman for Tass in Washington, asked about that word, replied: ''Diktat is a Russian word for an order or decree, and appears in both the original Russian text and the translation unchanged.''"
