      "lead_paragraph": "Despite their obvious differences -- mystery stories unpack the past, science fiction addresses the future -- the two genres have one thing in common. Both often challenge the reader to solve a puzzle that is posed early and kept in view throughout the narrative: Who killed Roger Ackroyd? What is the dominant species on this planet? Since such questions can typically be answered in a few declarative sentences, the more memorable stories focus not so much on what is revealed but on the circumstances of the revelation and its meaning for the people involved. THE CHILDREN STAR (Tor/Tom Doherrty, $24.95), by Joan Slonczewski, is a puzzle story that moves towards its denouement at a glacial pace but with unequivocal force. The planet Prokaryon can barely support human life. Its very undesirability makes it a bargain for the child-catchers of the Sacred Order of the Spirit, who scour the galaxy for orphans to raise at their underfunded Prokaryon mission. Little by little it appears that the dominant species on the planet may not be the human settlers after all; in ruling out native intelligence, the original colonists apparently failed to look closely or deeply enough."

      "lead_paragraph": "The countdown is set to begin tomorrow morning for a space flight that will not make history or any new heroes but has everything to do with history and an aging hero, John Glenn. Thirty-six years after he rode a cramped Mercury capsule to become the first American to orbit Earth, on Feb. 20, 1962, and 24 years after the trajectory of fame landed him in the United States Senate, Mr. Glenn will be suiting up again as an astronaut. At the age of 77, he will be the oldest person ever to fly in space, a hero of the cold war stepping forward this time as a role model for the geriatric generation -- and to satisfy an unending yearning."

Mr. Glenn, as everyone knows by now, is preparing to return to space on Thursday at an age -- 77 -- when many men are content to read Modern Maturity magazine after a gentle round of golf. Some of the spring in Mr. Glenn's step may be gone and his bones may be a little creaky, but here he is ready to board the space shuttle Discovery with other astronauts half his age to show the world, as he said in a recent interview, that the lives of older people need not be dictated by the calendar."

O'Malley, who pressed a black button to start the Atlas booster's engines and send Mr. Glenn on his way in a Mercury capsule, is 83 now but still full of sass and gruff charm. He and many of those who shared the anxiety, thrill and glory of the first Glenn flight, including the three surviving members of the original astronaut corps, are gathering again at Cape Canaveral to sip at the fountain of their youth. ''Those were great days, and we survived them,'' Mr. O'Malley recalled."

As he told MSNBC, ''The nation gets to revisit a time of imagination and hope and magic.'' That sounds more like a description of a Disney film than rocket science, yet it succinctly captures the gilded tone of the television coverage up to and including yesterday's high-profile launching. The networks and all-news channels quickly found their common theme: the return of an American hero. And after 10 months of wallowing in the Lewinsky sex scandal, you could almost feel their relief as they leaped on this wholesome story. In the last decade television news has virtually ignored space unless a satellite seemed about to tumble from the sky. But all week the network newscasts have been sounding the puffy theme of heroism, interviewing Mr. Glenn and doing features on his historic flight in 1962."
