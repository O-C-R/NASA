The officials said United States and Russian negotiators had rejected several Russian proposals designed to reduce its costs of assembling the international station, known as Alpha. But they said the United States had agreed to use shuttles to ferry the supplies to Mir and to place in orbit a Russian science module for Alpha to save Russia the expense of several rocket flights."

Late Saturday, four Americans, two Italians and one Swiss astronaut on board the Columbia are to unreel a cable out to maximum length of 12.5 miles, making it the longest man-made object ever put in orbit. A similar test in 1992 failed after a safety bolt accidentally limited the unreeling of the cable to little more than 800 feet."
