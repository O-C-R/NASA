The award-winning series has earned millions of dollars for its producers, director, actors and musicians. The \"Cheers\" logo, which was first drawn at C.B.J.'s tiny office on Third Street in Los Angeles, has been licensed, franchised and stamped on merchandise from beer mugs to T-shirts. And what did Jim Castle, Bruce Bryant and Carol Johnsen get out of all this? Mr. Castle thinks for a while. \"The satisfaction,\" he says finally."

She brings to these scenes the same rigorous narrative logic, the same unsparing extrapolation from premise to consequences that distinguishes her more conventional science fiction. Of the 12 stories in her new collection AND THE ANGELS SING (St. Martin's, $19.95), three were first published in Redbook magazine; the others appeared in such science fiction venues as Omni magazine and the Orbit series of hard-cover anthologies edited by Damon Knight. By positioning herself on the margin between fantasy and mainstream fiction, Ms. Wilhelm is able to undermine expectations from both genres. At every moment the stories in this collection threaten to veer toward the realistic or the fantastic; the longer both options are kept open, the more keenly the reader takes Ms. Wilhelm's point that, in the end, it makes no difference what compels people to question their grip on everyday reality -- what counts is how they respond when they come face to face with the unexpected."

(A repeat of the premiere can be seen at 11 tonight.) Looking a bit like Geena Davis crossed with a youthful version of Julia Child, Ms. Poundstone gives the impression of being unusually tall -- maybe she is -- as she lurches onto a small stage dressed in boots, jeans, floppy shirt and perhaps a vest. Sidling up to a stool, she seems a bit shy, perhaps self-conscious about her height, but then wastes no time in demonstrating that despite the friendly manner (\"You comfortable and everything?\"), this is one sharp, not-to-be-meddled-with woman."

Adminstration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Truly had been forced to step down. Mr. Truly, a space pioneer and former astronaut, was chosen to head NASA after the Challenger disaster in January 1986 to try to get the space agency back on its feet. His resignation comes as the agency again faces an uncertain future."
