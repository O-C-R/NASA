If you age a lot, there is finally almost nobody left who shares your vast experience of an incredibly fascinating world. Your exclusive experience of this broad culture, in fact, may make you slightly absurd and will almost certainly make you tiresome if you refuse to keep quiet about it. Thus, people born in the age of the \"It\" girl found it hilarious that their elders wore high-button shoes."

In the exhibition \"Modern Masks and Helmets,\" at the Museum of Modern Art through Nov. 19, many of the head protectors from the Space Age and earlier are imbued with symbolism as powerful as any found in tribal cultures. The show of 40 examples of headgear made between 1850 and 1990, to be worn at work, play and on the battlefield, is the first museum survey of such modern armor, according to Cara McCarty, an associate curator in the museum's department of architecture and design. Miss McCarty selected colorful and visually arresting artifacts, solutions to society's fear of nuclear warfare, terrorism, hazardous wastes as well as the dangers posed by competitive sports."
