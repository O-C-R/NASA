      "lead_paragraph": "NASA today tentatively set Sept. 12 as the launching date for space shuttle Atlantis, which has been grounded by problems with its rocket boosters. The shuttle was supposed to blast off on July 31 for the Russian space station Mir to pick up the American astronaut Shannon Lucid, who has been on Mir since March. NASA delayed the flight last week to replace the Atlantis's solid-fuel rocket boosters. Hot gas seeped into booster segment joints during the shuttle Columbia's launching last month, most likely because of a new adhesive. The same adhesive was used in the Atlantis's boosters."

ENCOUNTER WITH TIBER (Aspect/Warner, $21.95), by Buzz Aldrin and John Barnes, delivers the goods, and then some. Mr. Aldrin, the second man on the moon, has clearly lost none of his zest for launchings and landings, orbital insertions, aerocaptures, gravity assists and similar maneuvers necessary for getting a spaceship safely from here to there. His enthusiasm has led him, in collaboration with the author of novels like \"Kaleidoscope Century\" and \"Mother of Storms,\" to concoct a 560-page novel of the near future with a simple premise: Space holds the answer to all our problems."
