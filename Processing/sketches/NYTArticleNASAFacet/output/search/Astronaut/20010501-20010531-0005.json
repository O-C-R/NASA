But standing backstage at the Royale Theater after the Steppenwolf Theater Company's performance of the play based on his 1962 novel, ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' he made it clear that he has not entirely abandoned his prankster ways. ''You did a great performance,'' he told the play's star, Gary Sinise, ''but not quite as good as the one where you were going into space -- 'Apollo 13,' '' the 1995 film in which Mr. Sinise played an astronaut. Mr. Sinise, recovering from his all-out three-hour performance with a mug of tea, smiled politely and held out a faded paperback copy of the novel for Mr. Kesey to autograph. Mr. Kesey added that he had long suspected that Mr. Sinise was the illegitimate son of the actor DeForest Kelley, who played the doctor on the television show ''Star Trek,'' because of their physical resemblance."

FAMOUS -- From Griffin Dunne, a mock documentary about two would-be stars going through the routine -- casting calls, voice lessons, cosmetic surgery. Spike Lee and Carrie Fisher are among the cameos. Laura Kirk and Nat DeWolf are the stars. Aug. 22. JOHN CARPENTER'S GHOSTS OF MARS -- John Carpenter goes futuristic and extraterrestrial.

Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper reunite on the Great White Way as ageless rebels continuing their 30-year motorcycle trek in search of ''the real America.'' Tony Walton's set is a valentine to the psychedelic 60's, as is the pulsing rock score by the composer David Yazbek (''The Full Monty''), which includes the instant hits ''Bifocal Blues'' and ''We're Just a Coupla Fogeys on Harleys.''"

The 52nd exhibition, now on view, definitely has some color in it, along with the healthy glow that comes from mixing new artists with a lot who are recognizable from past shows. The show was selected by Bill Arning, curator of the MIT List Visual Arts Center in Cambridge, Mass. Recently, and for many years, he ran White Columns, an alternative space in Manhattan. So it's not surprising that the term ''cutting edge'' emerges in his curator's statement. The phrase's meaning has dulled by now, but it can indicate a work of art the likes of which one hasn't quite seen before. There are several that qualify in the 144 works Mr Arning chose from more than 1,000 entries."
