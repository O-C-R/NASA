Laid out on a large grid, the barnacle-encrusted wreckage provided testimony to the aerodynamic forces that tore the shuttle apart on Jan. 28, killing the seven astronauts."

''This is their day,'' she said. The incident revealed much about her reserved, apolitical style, which contrasts sharply with that of her gregarious predecessor."

Several other troubles that might have halted a real launching cropped up, but Jim Ball, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said officials considered the test successful because it accomplished its main goal: maintaining the efficiency of the launching team in the long flightless period since the Challenger exploded last Jan. 28, killing the shuttle's seven crew members. Comdr. Robert L. Gibson of the Navy, who commanded the astronaut crew aboard the Atlantis, termed the test ''a morale booster, even though it was a simulation, and a real morale booster for the launch team.''"

      "lead_paragraph": "FOR AS long as most of us can remember, children have been asked the mind-numbing question, ''What do you want to be when you grow up?'' Since they are resilient and creative, children learn to deal with this intrusive query with such culturally approved responses as ''a doctor'' (why not go for the No. 1 prestige and money?), ''the President'' or ''a movie star'' (interchangeable in some young heads these days), ''gourmet chef'' (now there's a sophisticate) and ''computer analyst'' (a pragmatic choice). A range of occupations from the adventurous (''astronaut'') to the prosaic (''stockbroker'') flows without hesitation from the lips of the youngest tot. Have they been primed, coached, influenced and molded by their parents, relatives and television too soon? Of course. Will their designated choice last? Perhaps. One thing is sure: The good old days of responses such as ''fireman [ now called firefighters ] , farmer, teacher, policeman [ now called police officers ] and nurse'' are long gone. These kids have moved ahead with the times."
