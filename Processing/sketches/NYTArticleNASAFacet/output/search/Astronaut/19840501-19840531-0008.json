It makes F. A. O. Schwarz look like a bargain basement; my 11- year-old stepson considers it the promised land. For over-12's, the street scene in Covent Garden, which features buskers and dancers, and Madame Tussaud's wax museum and planetarium have proved very popular. On a more serious level, kids like the Tower of London, with Crown jewels and Beefeaters, very much. The telephone directory's Yellow Pages have a list of baby-sitting agencies. One that can be highly recommended is Universal Aunts, 250 Kings Road, London SW3 (telephone 351-5767). They will also meet children arriving alone by plane, and they conduct sightseeing tours for them, singly or in groups. For real emergencies, dial 999 and give particulars to the operator. Again, the Yellow Pages have a list of private doctors, or you may consult the hotel about National Health Service offices (as the British call the clinics) in the area."

The session that officially begins Thursday is the 150th meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, whose theme this year is ''Science, Engineering, Technology, Education: Toward a World Perspective.'' While some scientific groups will begin meeting Wednesday, the main sessions of the association open Friday and continue through next Tuesday at the New York Hilton, Avenue of the Americas at 53d Street, and the Sheraton Centre, Seventh Avenue at 52d Street, where scores of meeting rooms have been reserved for participants. Registration for the sessions will be at the Hilton."

The paintings, willed to the trustees of the museum, are now displayed in crowded circumstances in Corner House, an 18th-century building Mr. Rockwell saved from the wrecker's ball. Average attendance there has been about 100,000 visitors a year, according to the museum director, David Wood. No big increase is expected at the new facility, but it would be in a residential neighborhood, rather than on the main street, and some opponents feared a flood of visitors."

The scarlet symbolizes Rutgers and the white represents arts, letters and humanities. The ritual meant Mr. Lerner possessed an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree for being an ''astute entrepreneur and energetic proponent of corporate civic duty.'' Mr. Burke's is one of an estimated 5,000 honorary degrees being awarded by colleges and universities around the country this commencement season, perpetuating a tradition almost as old as higher education itself. The degrees are viewed not only as a means of honoring high achievement but also of providing role models for students, publicity for the institution and encouragement of fields in which it specializes."

The three-term Representative said she differed with the findings of a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll that showed that a female Vice Presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket would lose as many votes as she would gain for the ticket. Mrs. Ferraro observed: ''Every other poll that I have seen shows a woman would help the ticket, and I believe those polls are accurate.'' Brushing aside questions about her own Vice Presidential aspirations, Mrs. Ferraro said, ''Either Mondale or Hart would be a super Presidential candidate'' and ''I will rely on the judgment of the eventual nominee to choose the best Vice President.''"
