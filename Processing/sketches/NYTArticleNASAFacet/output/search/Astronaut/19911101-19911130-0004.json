In short, the bill would allow victims of sex crimes or their families to sue the producers and distributors of obscene films, books and other publications on the ground that the material contributed to the crime. While the measure has met stiff opposition from the film and publishing industries and its fate is unclear, even the existence of such a proposal alarms video dealers, who have been under increasing pressure to censor themselves in some parts of the country. \"If there is any question of opening themselves to liability, dealers are going to play it safe and not carry films with sex scenes or anything that might be considered controversial,\" said Rick Karpel, the director of government relations of the Video Software Dealers Association, a national trade organization. \"If this bill passes, they'll clear the shelves.\" \"The Accused,\" about gang rape, is cited as the type of movie that might be removed."
