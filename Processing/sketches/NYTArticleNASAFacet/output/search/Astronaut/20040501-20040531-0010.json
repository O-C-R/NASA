Before that date, frozen pizzas were a gourmand's worst nightmare: overly chewy crusts topped with bland sauce, rubbery cheese and meat specks tougher than jerky. Then came Kraft Foods' first pie sold under the DiGiorno brand name, and the industry was reborn. Different from its cardboardlike predecessors, the DiGiorno pizza featured a rising crust, a food technology coup. Kraft's researchers were inspired in large part by three patents taken out in 1983 by General Foods of White Plains, which combined with Kraft in 1989. The patents covered the preparation and safe storage of frozen, yeast-leavened dough, a complex process involving the meticulous addition of hydrophilic colloids for stability and surfactants to ''facilitate flour hydration and initial dough development.'' Kraft also developed modified atmospheric packaging, which keeps the pies bathed in an inert gas rather than oxygen, which erodes the dough."

Clearly rural Indians, who make up the country's majority, were telling the cities and the government that they were not happy with the direction of events. I think I can explain what happened, but first I have to tell you about this wild typing race I recently had with an 8-year-old Indian girl at a village school. The Shanti Bhavan school sits on a once-scorpion-infested bluff about an hour's drive -- and 10 centuries -- from Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley. The students are all ''untouchables,'' the lowest caste in India, who are not supposed to even get near Indians of a higher caste for fear they will pollute the air others breathe. The Shanti Bhavan school, with 160 students, was started by Abraham George, one of those brainy Indians who made it big in high-tech America. He came back to India with a single mission: to start a privately financed boarding school that would take India's most deprived children and prove that if you gave them access to the same technologies and education that have enabled other Indians to thrive in globalization, they could, too."

Meanwhile, the end may be near for the telescope that has defined their era."
