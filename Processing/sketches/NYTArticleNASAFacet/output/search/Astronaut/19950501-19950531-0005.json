But what began as an attempt at political consolidation has quickly turned into an epidemic of divisiveness that would make a New York Democratic primary seem tame. Mr. Yeltsin had hoped to create joint blocs -- one led from the right by his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, another guided from the left by the Speaker of Parliament, Ivan P. Rybkin."

Under the plan announced by Daniel S.

Industry officials have said they could run the shuttle program for less money than the Government and still maintain safety."
