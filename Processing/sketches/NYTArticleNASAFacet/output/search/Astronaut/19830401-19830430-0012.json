Servicing of the Challenger, lighter and more powerful than its sister ship the Columbia, proceeded smoothly today at the Kennedy Space Center with rising expectations that the five-day mission would get under way on schedule at 1:30 Monday afternoon. The re-usable winged spaceship will carry into orbit a large communications satellite for a new spacecraft-tracking network. Two of the four astronauts plan to attempt a space walk that was canceled on the last shuttle mission because of spacesuit failures. The crew will also conduct extensive tests of the new vehicle's performance."

California's Senator Alan Cranston is running as a substitute Kennedy and Senator Gary Hart of Colorado as the ''new generation'' candidate. Next come several Southerners whose best hope - barring a Jimmy Carter-like leap to prominence - may lie in selling themselves as ticket-balancers who can challenge President Reagan in the Sun Belt."

But the current flight is quite different from the one he made nearly 10 years ago, when he spent almost a month in space in the first manned Skylab mission, helping to set what was then a world's record for time in space by spending 672 hours aboard the earthorbiting laboratory. The 50-year-old astronaut fondly recalls his Skylab experience and says that in 28 days he never got tired of looking at the Earth. ''Nearly all my time was spent at the window,'' he said. Before joining the space program, Mr. Weitz went through Navy flight training and received his wings in 1956. Two years earlier, he was commissioned as an ensign through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps program at Pennsylvania State University while he was earning a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering."

The plan they described involves raising the low point, or perigee, of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite's orbit in gradual steps until the orbit is circular at 21,950 miles, the current apogee, or high point, of the orbit. When the satellite was deployed by the space shuttle Challenger Monday, an apparent failure of an attached propulsion unit left the 5,000-pound craft in a lower, elliptical orbit ranging from 13,540 miles to 21,950 miles from the Earth. After the higher circular orbit is achieved, two additional firings by some of the satellite's 24 thruster jets are planned then to lift the satellite even higher to the desired altitude of 22,300 miles."

Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hailed the virtually trouble-free performance of the nation's newest space shuttle on its five-day flight and moved to hasten its ground servicing for another flight in two months. Only such a rapid turnaround will make it possible for the agency to meet its commitments to fly four more shuttle missions this year. Previously, the shuttles have required four or more months between flights. 'A Superb Spacecraft' At a post-landing news conference, Lieut. Gen. James A. Abrahamson of the Air Force, an associate administrator of the space agency, called the Challenger ''a superb spacecraft.'' Only 22 anomalies were reported in the flight, as against 82 on the first flight of Challenger's sister ship, the Columbia."
