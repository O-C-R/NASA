Byrd, the Senate Minority Leader, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary as he seeks his fifth term. In other primary voting today, Senator John C. Stennis, Democrat of Mississippi, faces two opponents in his bid for party renomination; two Democrats will vie in South Dakota to become the nominee against Governor William J. Janklow, a Republican, and both parties will nominate candidates for the governorship in New Mexico, where Bruce King, the Democratic incumbent, is prevented by state law from seeking re-election. New Mexico, West Virginia and South Dakota have Congressional primaries, but in Mississippi the balloting for the House of Representatives was delayed because the Justice Department has not accepted the state redistricting plan."

Knopf, May 1982). By AUDIE BOCK HAMILTON AIR FORCE BASE, CALIF. An imposing multiple gateway yawns open, guardless. The driveway, lined with squat, thick-crowned old palm trees, curves lazily past large blocks of buildings painted a creamy military hue. Surrounding them are overlush lawns, the recent floodgauge Northern California rains pushing their seedy tips into a waist-deep jungle. A filling station sign sports the elongated lettering that immediately recalls late 1950's graphic design. No one walks the street, and the classic Chevy Bel Aires and Studebakers one would almost expect to roll by fail to materialize. A closer look reveals that many windows are broken or boarded over, and as the outlying aircraft hangars come into view, the roads and sidewalks bear those same waist-high grasses growing up through cracks in the asphalt and concrete. Hamilton lies deserted, a ghost of the cold war, built about the time the Soviets launched the satellite that started the space race, Sputnik I, in October 1957."

For Colonel Chretien, a Breton-born fighter pilot, successful completion of the eight-day flight will mean a place alongside such heroes of French aviation as Louis Bleriot, who in 1909 piloted the first airplane to cross the English Channel. But the culmination of the 21-months he spent at Star City, the Soviet astronauts' training center on the northeast outskirts of Moscow comes at a time of chill in French-Soviet relations, and the political atmosphere has clouded what both nations originally envisioned as a celebration of detente. The schedule calls for the dart-shaped rocket to blast off from the Baikonur space launching center in the desert outside the city of Leninsk in Kazakhstan at 8:29 P.M., Moscow time, placing the Soyuz-T 6 spaceship into orbit 185 miles above the Earth. On Friday, the craft is scheduled to rendezvous and dock with the Salyut 7 orbiting laboratory in which two other Soviet astronauts have been working for six weeks."

Even before the first speech of the party conference, the trailers were busy today pumping hot air into the cavernous debating hall from their separate air conditioners. Political aides worked inside on paper strategies, preparing lists of the party delegates who will be wooed in the trailers for the next two days. Delegates will be cajoled by means of a flattering invitation to step off the convention floor and be greeted at the trailer door by the undeclared candidate who then might offer light refreshment and maybe even a willingness to listen at this early campaign point."

For the first time since the Apollo-Soyuz flight that linked Soviet and American spacecraft seven years ago, Soviet television relayed live coverage of the liftoff. Millions of people here and in Western Europe watched the 300-ton rocket, painted red, white and blue, ride a fireball of exhaust into the night sky from the Baikonur launching center, outside the city of Leninsk in Kazakhstan, on the first stage of its journey to an orbit 185 miles high. Liftoff came precisely as scheduled, at 8:29 P.M. Moscow time (12:29 this afternoon, New York time). Black and white shots from a camera aboard the Soyuz T-6 spacecraft relayed from the first moments of flight showed Colonel Chretien and his companions, Col. Vladimir A. Dzhanibekov, the mission commander, and Aleksandr S. Ivanchenkov, the flight engineer, sitting in their flight couches and scanning the instruments."

By no coincidence, the Soyuz-Salyut flight of Col. Jean-Loup Chretien has also marked the international debut of an impressive new mission control center outside Moscow. After a 10-month renovation that cost 30 million rubles, the equivalent of $41 million at the official rate of exchange, the center reopened last month just in time for the launching of the two-man Soviet crew that preceded Colonel Chretien and his Soviet partners to the Salyut 7 orbital laboratory. Glimpses of the new center were shown on Soviet television after the May 13 Salyut launching, but the full unveiling of the complex came with the liftoff Friday of the Soyuz-T 6 craft that carried Colonel Chretien, Col. Vladimir A. Dzhanibekov and Aleksandr S. Ivanchenkov. With millions of Western Europeans watching the first Soviet liftoff to be televised live since the Soyuz-Apollo mission in 1975, the managers of the Soviet program were evidently eager to give as good a show as any that European audiences have seen from Cape Canaveral and Houston."

      "lead_paragraph": "The space shuttle Columbia rocketed back into space today carrying its first military and commercial payloads and seeking to establish the re-usable spaceship's credentials for regular orbital operations. The Columbia rose from the launching pad on time for the first time, a few microseconds before 11 A.M., New York time, bound for a planned week of circling the Earth. It is the spaceship's fourth and final test mission. Thunderclaps from the rockets reverberated through the humid air, the ground trembled and eventually the spaceship disappeared in its own vapor trail. The astronauts, Capt. Thomas K. Mattingly 2d of the Navy and Henry W. Hartsfield Jr., were on their way to a 185-milehigh orbit, the highest thus far attained by the shuttle."

In that period, he has watched the development of the space program and observed as his colleagues took the voyages he would have given almost anything to be on."
