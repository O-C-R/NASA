''Not bad for 30 points down in New Hampshire, eh?'' Mr. Wade recalled Mr. Kerry saying. A year ago, as former President Bill Clinton said as he stood by his side last week before some 100,000 fans in Philadelphia, Mr. Kerry's quest for even the Democratic nomination seemed ''dead as a doornail.'' Now he is in a dead heat for the big prize. His desperate ditching of his campaign manager and mortgaging his house to reverse seemingly impossible odds in this state's early primary are but a bad dream."
