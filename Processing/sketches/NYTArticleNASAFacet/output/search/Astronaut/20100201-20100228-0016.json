Curtis for murder. Mr. John P.

He was found, still alive, late in the afternoon of September 18, twenty-four hours after he was first shot, with twelve bullet wounds in his body and a great gash in his throat."

The machines with two seats and one pair of wheels have often conjured thoughts of everlasting bliss and pedaling in union. For others, like Edward Pino and Liz Baums of Forest Hills, Queens, who own two tandems that they take on rides of up to 70 miles, the bike is somewhat less exalted; it's just a way to stay connected when both partners enjoy riding, but not necessarily at the same speed."

The professional roles they may play are the ostensible subject of ''When Elmo Grows Up,'' the latest in Sesame Street Live, a series of 90-minute musicals based on the television show. But the production, now at Madison Square Garden, is less a theatrical version of one of those old ''So You Want to Be a ...'' books than it is an excuse to gather the neighborhood crowd, devise new lyrics for pop standards and send the Monsters high-kicking across the stage like Rockettes with extremely hairy legs."

Descending at a 21-degree angle after a 5,000-mile glide from space, Col. George D. Zamka of the Marines pulled up the shuttle's nose and Col. Terry W. Virts Jr. of the Air Force, the pilot, deployed the ship's landing gear. The Endeavour touched down on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center at 10:20 p.m. Eastern time."

      "lead_paragraph": "Webinar (Web + seminar) seems like a fine neologism for a seminar offered online. A blend of two common terms, it's immediately understood by most people. I've been taking Webinars lately; I like them and appreciate having a handy word for them -- even though I'm often inclined to object to linguistic ''innovations.'' Lewis Carroll famously called blends like Webinar ''portmanteau'' words because they're two words packed into one. (A portmanteau was essentially a suitcase with two compartments folded together.) Carroll made up several such words for his poem ''Jabberwocky'' (1871), including chortle (chuckle + snort) and galumph (gallop + triumph). Chortle has stayed with us, while galumph appears to have gone the way of gyre and gimble. Why? Because chortle is so handy and so onomatopoeically evocative (think of the laugh of a portly chum)."
