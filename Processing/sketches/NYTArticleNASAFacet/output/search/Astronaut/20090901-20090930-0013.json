(Ages 11 and up) From its cinematic opening -- a cliffhanger cutaway of a girl being chased by a wild boar -- this noir comic sets up an inviting oddball mystery. K. Westree arrives at the remote Bellsong Academy for Girls to discover that school isn't in session. Instead, a cruel headmistress is training the other three ''students'' to be thieves as part of some grand scheme, and K. has been tapped to join them. Sala's style is cheerfully over-the-top, and the well-constructed plot, which is big on girl-power, as well as the sharply drawn characters will pull readers in."

It was just one moment of mutual affirmation in a concert with an ever-expanding mission. The concert had everything to do with scale, juxtaposing the intimate and the gargantuan, the personal and the universal. U2 kept raising the metaphysical ante. At first the show was about the band itself and its joy in the music it has been making for more than 30 years together. The set began with ''Breathe,'' a song from U2's current album, ''No Line on the Horizon'' (Interscope), that declares, ''I've found grace inside a sound.''"
