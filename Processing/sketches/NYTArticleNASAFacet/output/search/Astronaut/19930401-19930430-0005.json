The next day at a cafe in the shadow of Saint-Sulpice, I said to d'Aboville's wife, Cornelia, \"He is my hero.\" She replied softly, with feeling, \"Mine too.\" It is a commonplace that almost anyone can go to the moon: you pass a physical and NASA puts you in a projectile and shoots you there. It is perhaps invidious to compare an oarsman with an astronaut, but rowing across the Pacific Ocean alone in a small boat, as the Frenchman Gerard d'Aboville did in 1991, shows old-fashioned bravery. Yet even those of us who go on journeys in eccentric circles, simpler and far less challenging than d'Aboville's, seldom understand what propels us. Ed Gillet paddled a kayak 63 days from California to Maui a few years ago and cursed himself much of the way for not knowing why he was making such a reckless crossing. Astronauts have a clear, scientific motive, but adventurers tend to evade the awkward questions why."

The launching occurred exactly on time, at 10:50 A.M., much to the relief of German and American space officials. The flight had been postponed repeatedly since February to replace equipment, and last month came within three seconds of liftoff, only to be held up by a stuck engine valve."
