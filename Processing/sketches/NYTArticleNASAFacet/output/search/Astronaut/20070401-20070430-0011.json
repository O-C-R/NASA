This week, on Saturday, the former Microsoft engineer who oversaw the creation of the ''Word'' and ''Excel'' software programs is scheduled to depart on a roughly 12-day orbital flight to the International Space Station on a Soyuz TMA spacecraft, along with two cosmonauts. Having paid about $25 million to Space Adventures, a privately owned space tourism company, Mr. Simonyi will become the fifth civilian space tourist to pay for the out-of-this-world experience. Mr. Simonyi will not only orbit the earth at approximately 17,500 kilometers per hour, he will also assist in space station research and share a six-course meal -- prepared by the French chef Alain Ducasse from a menu chosen by Martha Stewart -- with the crew. Mr. Simonyi's Web site and blog (www.charlesinspace.com) is already loaded with images (including a hilarious video of him doing weightless exercises in the zero G simulator), and has a ''Kid's Space,'' with a link where children can pose questions about space travel."

Since then, they have traversed the Earth inside the atmosphere, to Italy, France and just recently, to the vineyards of the Napa Valley."

And yet 13-year-old Petr Ginz remains wryly amused, writing in his diary: ''When I went to school, I counted sixty-nine 'sheriffs.' '' Such is the life of a young Czechoslovakian Jewish boy living in Prague in 1941, and it is a life that Petr meticulously documented in his diary until he was sent on a transport to Theresienstadt and, ultimately, to his death in an Auschwitz gas chamber two years later. On Sunday, to coincide with Holocaust Remembrance Day, Atlantic Monthly Press will officially release Petr's story, ''The Diary of Petr Ginz: 1941-1942.'' The book is already available in stores and online."

Golden Garibaldi fish swam among swaying leaves of kelp; stingrays and a small shark kicked up grainy clouds of sand. A dark reef loomed amid imposing waves as we approached the headland. I was experiencing my first successful attempt at standup paddling on a surfboard, and the sensation of rowing upright across the glassy ocean without the energy of a swell made me feel like an astronaut on a spacewalk. Standing above the aquatic world like this turned surfing into an utterly new experience."

Auditioning along with her will be guest stars like Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Amy Brenneman, who will reportedly pop up when Ms. Walsh's character makes a trip to California to visit old school friends. Some other May sweepings: In an episode titled ''Rocket Man'' (NBC, Tuesday, 9 p.m.), ''LAW & ORDER: CRIMINAL INTENT'' rips from the headlines the sad case, barely four months old, of the astronaut Lisa Marie Nowak. In this telling the possible romantic rival has been murdered, and the space-shuttle-piloting object of everyone's affections is played by Tate Donovan. And My Network TV, still trying to find its way after abandoning one of television's most short-lived programming strategies (telenovelas? in English?), presents ''BODY DOUBLES: INTERNATIONAL TWINS SEARCH'' (Tuesday, 9 p.m.), billed as a ''most beautiful twins'' competition. Last week in this slot, My Network TV gave us ''Ujena Bikini Jam.'' Such, apparently, is the value of prime-time broadcast real estate these days. At the higher end of the culture scale, Turner Classic Movies presents a new two-part documentary, ''BRANDO'' (Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m.). Talking heads, including Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and Edward Norton, share their memories of watching and working with the great actor (Mr. Scorsese: ''Every day cinema was being reinvented.''). TCM will also be showing eight Brando films over those two nights, including ''THE WILD ONE'' (Wednesday, 9:30 p.m.) and ''ON THE WATERFRONT'' (Thursday, 12:30 a.m.). On PBS, ''American Masters'' has a two-hour profile of the pop-music impresario Ahmet Ertegun, who died in December. ''ATLANTIC RECORDS: THE HOUSE THAT AHMET BUILT'' (Wednesday night on most PBS stations; check local listings) includes interviews with Mr. Ertegun covering a four-year period. And ''American Experience'' and ''Frontline'' have combined to produce ''THE MORMONS'' (Monday and Tuesday nights on most PBS stations), a four-hour examination of the Mormon Church's history and influence."

      "lead_paragraph": "'Disturbia' Fends Off New Challengers The spring peeper movie ''Disturbia'' (distributed by Paramount and starring Shia LaBeouf, above, spent a third weekend atop the North American box-office rankings, taking in $9.1 million, according to estimates compiled by the tracking company Media by Numbers. But two newcomers crashed the top five. ''The Invisible'' (Buena Vista), an excursion into fright, finished second with $7.6 million, and ''Next'' (Paramount), starring Nicolas Cage as a Las Vegas magician who can see into the future, was third with a gross of $7.2 million. Not far behind, with $7 million in its second week, was the thriller ''Fracture'' (New Line). The ice-skating comedy ''Blades of Glory'' (Paramount) was next with $5.2 million in its fifth week in theaters, bringing its total to $108 million. Prince Charles to Skip Diana Memorial Concert Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, will not attend the concert planned for July 1 by his sons, Princes William and Harry (right, with William on the left), to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of their mother and Charles's former wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, Agence France-Presse reported. Among the scheduled performers at the new 90,000-seat Wembley Stadium in London are Elton John, Rod Stewart, Kanye West and Duran Duran. ''The concert is really for the younger generation to enjoy,'' The Times of London quoted Prince Charles's spokesman as saying. ''There will be a memorial service for Diana on Aug. 31, which will be an event for all generations of the Windsors to come together.'' Charles and Diana were married in 1981, separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996. She died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Jazz Festival Gets Support The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival has attracted its first long-term corporate sponsor, The Associated Press reported. Organizers said the sponsorship of Shell Exploration and Production, an energy development company, would keep the event from being scaled back as New Orleans recovers from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. ''It changes a lot of things,'' Quint Davis, the producer and director of the festival, said. ''We're able to make long-term plans for the festival now.'' Frank Glaviano, a Shell vice president for production, said, ''We wanted to give a gift to the people of New Orleans after all they had gone through.'' The sponsorship will continue through at least 2010. This year's festival began on Friday and resumes next Friday. 'Frankenstein' in Seattle ''Young Frankenstein,'' the latest musical to be adapted from a Mel Brooks film comedy, will hold its pre-Broadway tryout in Seattle from Aug. 4 through Sept. 1 at the Paramount Theater, Variety.com reported. The recently closed Broadway hit ''The Producers,'' also adapted from a film by Mr. Brooks, had its tryout in Chicago. Other Broadway shows that had pre-Broadway runs in Seattle include ''Hairspray'' and ''The Wedding Singer.'' ''Young Frankenstein,'' planned for Broadway in the fall, reunites Mr. Brooks with Thomas Meehan, with whom he wrote the book for ''The Producers,'' and with Susan Stroman, the hit's choreographer and director. Casting and a Broadway theater have not been announced. Scotty Takes a Ride Somewhere, James Doohan may be beaming. Mr. Doohan, who portrayed Scotty, the chief engineer of the starship Enterprise on ''Star Trek,'' was rocketed to the edge of space on Saturday from a desert launching ground near Truth or Consequences, N.M., Reuters reported. As hundreds of spectators applauded, cheered and wept, a capsule like those above containing the cremated ashes of Mr. Doohan, who was 85 when he died two years ago, zoomed aloft with the remains of 200 other people, including the astronaut Gordon Cooper, who went into space twice in the 1960s and died at 77 in 2004. Reaching a height of 384,000 feet, or more than 72 miles, the flight on Saturday was arranged by the Houston-based company Space Services Inc., which charges $495 to send a portion of a person's ashes on a 15-minute flight before the cargo parachutes back to Earth. The capsules are retrieved, mounted on plaques and given to relatives. ''It was great, it was fun, and we want to go again,'' said Mr. Doohan's widow, Wende Doohan, who pressed the launch button with Mr. Cooper's widow, Suzan Cooper. (P.S. Nobody on ''Star Trek'' ever actually said, ''Beam me up, Scotty.'') 'Idol' Finalist Arrested Jessica Sierra, one of the Top 10 finalists on ''American Idol'' in 2005, was arrested early yesterday in Tampa, Fla., on a felony battery charge, The Associated Press reported. She was accused of hitting a man on the head with a heavy glass at a cafe, the police said. Ms. Sierra, 21, above, was booked on a charge of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and also charged with possession of cocaine and introduction of contraband into a correctional facility. A police spokeswoman said officers found a small amount of the drug while searching her. Bail was set at $11,500. Vonnegut's Final Bow Kurt Vonnegut's final writing -- a 13-page speech he planned to deliver at Butler University -- was a highlight of a celebration of his life and literature on Friday in his hometown, Indianapolis, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Vonnegut, the author of novels including ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' and ''Cat's Cradle,'' died on April 11 at 84. The lecture was delivered by his son, Mark, as part of a yearlong tribute to the author by Indianapolis. Mark Vonnegut said of his father, ''He was really, really serious about being funny.'' Hopping from topic to topic in the written speech, Mr. Vonnegut noted that he achieved the same military rank as Napoleon and Hitler, that he intended to sue a cigarette manufacturer for breach of promise (''Their product did not kill me'') and that the final words of a condemned man ought to be, ''This will certainly teach me a lesson.'' The last sentence of the speech was, ''I thank you for your attention, and I'm outta here.'' Footnote Alison Stewart and Luke Burbank will be the hosts of the NPR morning news show that is to make its debut in September. Their daily two-hour morning drive-time newsmagazine will be the centerpiece of a new 24-hour service intended for adults 25 to 44. Ms. Stewart will join NPR from NBC and MSNBC. Mr. Burbank has been a reporter for NPR News for four years."
