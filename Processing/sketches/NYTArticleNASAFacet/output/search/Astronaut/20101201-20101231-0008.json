He never planted one of them on the moon. (As command module pilot of Apollo 16, he did not set foot on the moon.)"

      "lead_paragraph": "When ''Tron'' opened in 1982, it seemed to offer irrefutable proof that the next cinematic revolution would be digitized and possibly in DayGlo. The movie starred Jeff Bridges as a video game designer sucked into an electronic world (a nice metaphor for an industry that often puts technological trippery above art) that was eye-popping and lid-dropping, with jolts of beauty blazing amid a morass of sluggish storytelling. The main attractions -- bleeding-edge computer-generated imagery and an alternative reality aglow with pulsing phosphorescent colors usually found under the sea or black lights -- pointed toward a brave new world. But the public largely didn't buy into that world, and the film sputtered at the box office. Three decades later Disney has gone back to the electronic drawing board and returned with ''Tron: Legacy,'' a sequel with far less color and cinematic imagination, and many more bells and whistles, including a freakishly special-effected Mr. Bridges going mano a mano in cyberspace with the grizzled real deal. Twice as much Jeff Bridges does not necessarily mean twice as much entertainment -- bummer. But it does offer the sight of the actor returning to the same kind of paycheck-padding gig that landed him in the first ''Tron,'' if without a young man's embarrassment. He's Jeff Bridges, man, and having been summoned to reprise his role as Kevin Flynn, computer genius, he wears a beatific Zen gaze and the look of a man having a pretty good time."

A gas tank in the power-house of the New York Central Railway in the Fiftieth street blew up, and the scene that followed resembled the aftermath of an earthquake. The dead and dying lay about the streets and sidewalks, and white-coated surgeons from half a dozen of the city hospitals were rushing about attending to the wounded."

The signalman said, according to the ''Daily Mirror,'' that he was very busy on the morning in question. He turned the two light engines, into which the express ran on the down line for Carlisle, and presumed that they went to the advance starting signal. His instructions were to put the light engines ''in block'' and send them to Carlisle. Major Pringle, representing the Board of Trade: ''Did you do it?'' Witness: ''No; I am sorry.''"
