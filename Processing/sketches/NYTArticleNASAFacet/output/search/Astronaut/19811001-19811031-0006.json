Campbell-Ewald, Detroit, will become its new ad agency on Jan. 1, replacing Young & Rubicam of New York, the largest American agency, which served the account for 17 years. Billings will be in the neighborhood of $50 million, and the account immediately will become the agency's second-largest piece of business after the General Motors Corporation's Chevrolet, which trade sources put at about $120 million. The Campbell-Ewald coup is almost a personal victory for Thomas B. Adams, World War II Navy flyer and hero, who is chairman of the agency. A self-described '' ex-fly boy'' he has long wanted a major airline account. And Campbell-Ewald, one of the Interpublic Group of Companies since 1972, has operated an airline task force dedicated to winning such an account for about five years."

The Soviet plans were outlined Sept. 29 in Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, in a progress report on space activity marking the fourth anniversary of the Salyut 6 station. Since its launching in September 1977, the orbiting station has been the centerpiece of the Soviet space program, serving as a base for tests of human endurance, with crews spending as long as 185 days aboard. The Pravda report said a lull in the program was being used for a long-due overhaul of the ground control center at Yevpatoriya in the Crimea. While many employees are on long-postponed vacations, a skeleton staff is monitoring conditions aboard Salyut 6, which has been orbiting without astronauts since its last two-man crew returned to earth May 26 after a 75-day stay."

Looking ahead - and assuming that Ronald Reagan does not make such a success of his Presidency that a second term is guaranteed - a visiting Episcopal bishop lights a cigar and asks, ''Well, whom will you chaps run for President next time round?'' ''Fritz is so divine,'' a Washington matron gushes in a soft Southern accent. ''Fritz is surely gonna run.'' ''Teddy,'' a heavy-set lawyer says. ''Then there's Jay,'' the hostess intones sweetly. ''My dears, Jay Rockefeller's spending oodles of money for it.'' ''Gary Hart might just make it,'' a college professor observes as a lightning flash turns the room milky white. ''What about John Glenn?'' another guest inquires just before the thunder rolls. In the quiet that follows, nobody responds immediately."

One of them will grip the hand controller jutting from the control console and, after checking all systems, apply pressure. Reacting to that pulse of human energy, translated through a maze of electronic circuitry, a long, slender metal arm will rise out of its cradle in the cargo bay with a slow, robotic salute. This will be the beginning of one of the most critical tests for the second mission of the space shuttle Columbia, now set for launching Nov. 4. The flexing of the multijointed robot arm, with remotely controlled manipulations of its ''wrist,'' ''elbow'' and ''shoulder,'' should be the most visible symbol of what will be different when the spaceship returns to orbit. For the Columbia's inaugural flight last April, the astronauts' objective was to prove the large winged vehicle flightworthy. The spaceship lifted off under rocket power, orbited the earth for two days with an empty cargo bay and glided to a smooth touchdown in the"
