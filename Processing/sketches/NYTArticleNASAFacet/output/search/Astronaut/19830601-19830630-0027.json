Whereas ''Diagnosis of the Problem'' qualifies for an A-, the ''Prescription for Solving the Problem'' deserves an F; overall grade, D+. It cannot be denied that the public school system in large measure is rooted in the past, is ever becoming more obsolete and functions nowhere near as efficiently and effectively as it should and could. Equally true is the fact that a malfunctioning system should not be turned back to a time when it was even less effective and less efficient, as the several commissions recommend. The reports suffer from ''a little more of the same'' syndrome derived from the belief that if two pills are good for the patient, four must be better."

Tsongas of Massachusetts. Mr. Tsongas, a leader of the so-called Atari, or new wave Democratic liberals in the Senate, is believed to feel that Mr. Glenn is beginning to show that he is the Democrat best able to defeat President Reagan, or any other Republican, in 1984. His endorsement of Mr. Glenn was considered likely to vex the other Democratic candidates, especially former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who suffers in some party circles from an old-fashioned liberal image, linked to President Carter and Hubert H. Humphrey. The endorsement of Mr. Glenn, the former astronaut from Ohio, comes at a time when opinion polls show him gaining on the other candidates. Reflecting the fine-edged calculating of primary campaigns, the expected Tsongas support was seen as significant because Massachusetts has an early primary and will send to the nominating convention the largest delegation from New England."

The decision by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to send the first American woman, a 32-year-old physicist, into space along with four male crewmen has been made despite long doubts, and what some might call prejudices, about the abilities of women to withstand the physical and psychological rigors of such an ordeal. ''No one could find any reason women could not fly,'' says Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, chief of NASA's biomedical laboratories. The NASA decision was based on tests and theoretical analyses done on the earth. Further questions now remain to be answered on the basis of actual flight in space: What is the best male-female balance among crew members? Will weightlessness have different effects on the muscle, cardiovascular, bone and hormonal systems in men and women? What are the psychological consequences of long-term isolation in small space? The forthcoming missions should begin to provide the answers."

That, however, is a recreant's dodge and will leave her fuming, or - if your relationship has not been formalized into marriage - rejoicing that she discovered before it was too late the boor that lurked beneath the aura of quiet manhood that first attracted her, learned that still waters are often not deep but stagnant."

Then his normally squinty eyes narrowed even further with amusement. ''I always thought,'' he announced into a plume of pipe smoke, ''that Ike was a very handsome man. Period.'' More to the point, Dwight D. Eisenhower was an avuncular, unthreatening leader who was able to transmute the loose change of an heroic image into the hard currency of political support. That is the task before Senator Glenn, and talk that he is trying to become a ''Democratic Eisenhower'' is heard often in Washington. For Senator Glenn, the question of whether he is trying to use Republican-style appeal in a party that already suspects him of excessive conservatism is a sensitive one. But if the Senator resorts to humorous evasions on this subject, his supporters and advisers do not. To them, his is a Democratic candidacy based in large part on the fact that he mirrors the strengths of successful Republican candidates, including President Eisenhower and President Reagan."

Liftoff is scheduled for 7:33 A.M. Saturday, Eastern daylight time. The five astronauts, the largest crew to be launched, reviewed flight plans, checked equipment and practiced their flying skills in jet trainers as they prepared for the planned six-day mission. It will be the second flight of the Challenger, which was put in service last March, and the seventh shuttle flight."

Reaching into the void with a 50-foot robotic arm, she plans to capture a satellite as it hurtles about the earth and, using mechanical might conferred by gears and motors, bring it safely to rest in the cargo bay of the space shuttle. Her aerial exercise points to the not-so-distant future when it could be routine to grasp satellites, mine asteroids, build space stations - in short, to clutch and shape instead of just to pass through space as an awestruck visitor. It marks a new stage in the taming of the high frontier."

The scores were 3-6, 5-7, 7-6, 7-5, 6-2. Odizor's amazing saga began as a promising 15-year-old player in Lagos. Discovered by an American college professor, he was encouraged to continue his education in the United States, was graduated with a degree in marketing from the University of Houston in 1981 and is now ranked 82d on the men's computer rankings."

Early Wednesday morning, as now planned, the astronauts are to pick up the 5,000-pound satellite with the shuttle's robotic arm, drop it out of the cargo bay, fly as much as 1,000 feet away from it and then go back and, again using the 50-foot-long arm, retrieve it for restowage in the cargo bay. This operation, the first major test of the many-jointed mechanical arm, is considered an important rehearsal for future missions when space shuttles will be called on to rendezvous with satellites for servicing and repairs. Flight controllers said the Challenger and its five-person crew continued to make space flight look easy, with the health of both the machine and the astronauts reported to be excellent. Their six-day mission is scheduled to end Friday morning with a landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida."

To say that Mr. Leonard has realized his dream is somewhat like saying the astronaut Neil Armstrong made good on a boyhood fantasy of flying an airplane. Mr. Leonard sells 10 million quarts of milk a year, not to mention a million pints of cream, a million cartons of yogurt, 100 tons of cottage cheese, a million dozen eggs and equally staggering quantities of 600 other products. He has not driven a delivery truck since the late 1960's, when the state of Connecticut furrowed a highway through his dairy farm. But Mr. Leonard says he remains essentially a milkman - perhaps the most successful one in America."

Five times the astronauts released the 15-foot-long, Shuttle Pallet Satellite, or SPAS, which weighs 3,200 pounds on earth. Five times the astronauts, particularly Dr. Sally K. Ride and Col. John M.
