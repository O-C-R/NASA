There it looms majestically over the audience, its 4,200 pipes encased in mahogany. The player seated at the built-in console of the instrument appears an incidental part of the machinery -- almost an afterthought in the visceral power of the music. Robert Fertitta, who will play the Flentrop in three works with the Westchester Philharmonic here next Saturday at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M., compares himself to an astronaut navigating a space shuttle through the cosmos. For Mr. Fertitta, the cosmos is the point, not the lowly astronaut; the music, not the musician."
