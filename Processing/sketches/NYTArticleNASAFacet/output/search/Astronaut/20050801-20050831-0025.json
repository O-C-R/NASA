If so, the agency may order the first spacewalk to the underside of the orbiter to correct the problem, officials said Sunday. Analysts are still studying whether these strips of material, called gap filler, poking out of the shuttle's underbelly by about an inch, could lead to unusual patterns of heating during re-entry. If they are poking out at the forward end of the shuttle, as both of these are, the heating could affect parts of the craft's belly downstream, with some areas becoming as much as 25 percent hotter and beginning the most severe heating earlier than usual. That could potentially be a threat to its structure."

David Letterman Although doctors did caution President Bush about his posture. They noticed when he starts he tends to lean way to the right. Jay Leno On Tuesday, President Bush left for a five-week-long summer vacation, but the White House insists it's a ''working vacation.'' For instance, this morning the president worked on a model airplane and a fort made out of Legos. Conan O'Brien SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING In science news, astronomers claim they have discovered a 10th planet in our solar system. It's the planet right after Pluto, which I guess would make it Goofy? Jay Leno Today at the White House, President Bush spoke to the astronauts who are orbiting the Earth on the space shuttle Discovery. Unfortunately, the astronauts couldn't hear the president because he was standing on the White House lawn with a megaphone. David Letterman Big relief today for NASA and the crew aboard the space shuttle Discovery. Astronaut Steve Robinson went out of the ship and successfully removed two pieces of ceramic material that were dangling from the shuttle's belly. He also put a new registration sticker on the ship's license plate.

''O.K., I guess I have some explaining to do.'' ''I have never intentionally used steroids while traveling through time, period.'' ''I love steroids. Yum. Yum. Yum.'' Craig Ferguson Baltimore Orioles' slugger Rafael Palmeiro claims he didn't intentionally take steroids; he must have taken them accidentally. Apparently, Palmeiro handed his trainer a syringe and said, ''Surprise me.'' Conan O'Brien You know, Rafael Palmeiro was suspended for steroid use. To give you an idea how strong the steroids he used were, he's sitting out 10 games, still got three home runs last night.

      "lead_paragraph": "The space shuttle Discovery separated from the International Space Station at 3:24 a.m. Eastern time on Saturday and conducted a victory lap around the station -- a fly-around that allowed Discovery's crew to photograph the orbiting outpost -- as the crew made final preparations to return to Earth on Monday. Even accepting for the sake of argument that the mission is, as the NASA administrator, Michael Griffin, put it on Friday, ''magnificent,'' the shuttle returns to a realm of enormous uncertainty. NASA cannot yet say when shuttles will fly again, or how many missions can be flown before the 2010 retirement date that the Bush administration has set for the shuttle. Designs for follow-on vehicles are taking shape, but are still vague -- and the president's plan to use those new craft for missions to return to the moon and go beyond are even more so. The primary goals of Discovery's mission -- resupplying the space station and testing the cameras and sensors that let NASA truly measure the extent of launch debris for the first time -- were accomplished handily by the commander, Col. Eileen M. Collins, and her crew. Beyond that, it has been a mission with high and low points. Discovery's external tank shed so much less debris than earlier ones that the shuttle had just 25 scars on its tiles, onesixth of the usual amount. But the largest chunk of foam, at 0.9 pounds, was more than enough to cause another catastrophe if it had fallen at an earlier point in the ascent and hit the vehicle; NASA officials announced that no shuttle could fly again until the problem was fixed. There were also the dangling strips of cloth called gap fillers that might have led to damaging heat during re-entry. To remove that threat, NASA ordered the first-ever spacewalk to the underside of the shuttle. The astronaut Steven K. Robinson plucked the offending bits of rigid cloth from between the tiles with ease. But mission managers decided against a spacewalk to correct an insulating blanket that had puffed out from a spot near the commander's window. The engineers could not come up with a fix they had confidence in, and which made it worth the risk of a spacewalk. Discovery is scheduled to glide to the ground as early as 4:46 a.m. Eastern time Monday at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The time is dictated by the way the shuttle's orbit brings it in line with the approach to Cape Canaveral; if necessary, a second opportunity will come slightly later in the morning, at 6:21. If the weather does not bode well for landing in Florida on Monday, NASA managers will consider two additional landing sites for Tuesday -- Edwards Air Force Base in California or the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The strong preference is for a Florida landing, however, since the shuttle does not need to be ferried to Florida. At a briefing on Saturday, the deputy manager of the shuttle program, N. Wayne Hale, said mission managers believed that the return would be safe but that if a landing at Edwards was necessary they would adjust the shuttle's orbit to avoid flying over Los Angeles. Current weather predictions for Florida, he said, are ''about as good a forecast as you're going to get.'' There are still risks in re-entry, where the fiery plunge into the atmosphere exposes surfaces of the craft to thousands of degrees of heating. NASA hands say they were not always deeply concerned about this leg of the mission, however. ''Frankly, de-orbit was considered, for lack of a better word, a less risky part of flight than ascent,'' said John Ira Petty, a spokesman for NASA, ''until Columbia.'' The descent gives few clues of its progress. By comparison, the launching has milestones that help observers mark the progress past the various dangerous stages: the solid rocket boosters break away from the shuttle after two minutes, and the external tank separates at eight and a half minutes. Moment by moment, the spectators' tension eases. Dr. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said at the news conference Friday that descent was different: ''We don't have those kind of milestones,'' he said. ''We just have to go through it and see how it comes out.'' That is why he has warned that the risks of space flight do not end until the mission does. On NBC's ''Meet the Press'' last Sunday he was asked, ''When will you be absolutely confident that it's safe for Discovery to return home?'' Dr. Griffin wryly replied, ''When Eileen has Discovery stopped on the runway and is ready to be towed off.'' He added, ''There is no elimination of all risk.'' But now, with the return in sight, the shuttle families, mission managers and NASA officials are beginning to talk about what to do when it is all over. Pat Youngs, Colonel Collins's husband, says his wife has told him in several e-mail messages from space what she wants when she gets home: Mexican food. ''She's an enchilada fan,'' said Mr. Youngs, who is a commercial pilot. In a briefing for reporters on Friday morning, Paul Hill, the lead flight director for the mission, was asked how he might celebrate. ''I'll probably shake hands, hug a few people in the control room and go back home to be with my family,'' he said. ''And drink.'' And Dr. Griffin, who prides himself on maintaining an unemotional mien, when asked the same question, paused briefly. ''I'll smile,'' he said."

This flight was supposed to vault the shuttle fleet back into space after a prolonged grounding for repairs. But given the repeat of the very problem that two years of retooling was supposed to resolve, the verdict is necessarily mixed. Once again, the space agency has been forced to suspend further flights until it can find a fix for the foam-shedding, and no one seems willing to guess how long that may take. The Discovery astronauts performed superbly during their two-week mission, and the shuttle looked better than ever in some respects. Space officials were justifiably jubilant that so much had gone well, despite daily hand-wringing over possible perils. The flight clearly achieved its prime objectives."
