''The general thought at the time was that fat people ate too much,'' Atkinson, now at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me recently. ''And we documented that fat people do eat too much -- our subjects ate an average of 6,700 calories a day. But what was so impressive to me was the fact that not all fat people eat too much.''"
