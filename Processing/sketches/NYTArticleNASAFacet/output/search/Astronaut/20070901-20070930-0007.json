And sloppy. Just because he's playing an awkward junior high school-age boy doesn't mean he has to look like one. Buy some scissors, for crying out loud."

They are uneven, given a shabby-chic production by the Boomerang Theater Company that could satisfy only a fledgling playwright. Mr. Stoppard was fledgling when he wrote them, of course. And although they are contemporary with his breakthrough ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' you can glimpse him finding his way."

Nothing would ever be quite the same again -- in geopolitics, in science and technology, in everyday life and the capacity of the human species. The Soviet Union had launched the first artificial satellite, a new moon, on Oct. 4, 1957. Climbing out of the terrestrial gravity well, rising above the atmosphere and into orbit, Sputnik crossed the threshold into a new dimension of human experience. People could now see their kind as spacefarers. Their enhanced mobility might someday prove as liberating as the first upright steps of hominid ancestors long ago."
