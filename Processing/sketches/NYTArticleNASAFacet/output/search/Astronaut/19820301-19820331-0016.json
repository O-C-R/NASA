Mr. McDivitt, a retired Air Force general, is now with Rockwell International in Pittsburgh as senior vice president of strategic planning. Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., announced the appointment on a weekend trip to Pittsburgh. Mr. Hooks said that, although the N.A.A.C.P. has opposed the Reagan defense budget along with the cuts in social programs, he saw no inconsistency in its association with Rockwell, which has a $2.2 billion contract for the B-1 bomber."

Instead of emerging from its burrow for a brief look-see, as it is apt to do on Feb. 2 or any other randomly chosen day in midwinter, the woodchuck - along with bats, ground squirrels, hedgehogs, dormice and several other rodents and insectivores of cold and temperate zones -has come to the end of his winter hibernation and rejoins the world of the full-time mammals. Unlike, for example, bears, which merely doze and can awaken suddenly on provocation, true hibernators shut down shop for the duration. The metabolism of these animals drops to nearly nothing. Body temperature falls nearly to freezing. Heartbeat slows - in ground squirrels, for example, from 350 beats per minute to three or four. Stuffed with fat stored in the summer, they doze through months of snow and ice, which might otherwise starve them to death by depriving them of forage. In spring they emerge, thinner than before but ready to start a new season."

A decade or so ago, when a thousand scholarly flowers bloomed, few seemed as promising, or as alluring to Federal officials, as the flower of futurism. The United States seemed to overcome its antipathy to concerted planning and began seriously considering the shape the future might take. Even Congress, whose members seldom looked beyond the next election, started examining the implications of legislation in fields such as energy, the environment and social policy. Now, however, activity in the field has slowed to the point of stopping. ''Actually, it died somewhere in the 1970's,'' said Michael Marien, the editor of ''Futures Survey,'' a monthly abstract published by the World Future Society. ''Nobody announced its death, but it happened.'' Mr. Marien, who has been monitoring futures literature for the past dozen years, said the flood of books on trends and forecasts is down to a trickle."

In 1977, he was a member of one of the two crews of astronauts who piloted the prototype shuttle Enterprise in a series of approach and landing tests at Edwards Air Force Base in California. A Boeing 747 piggybacked the Enterprise to a high altitude and released it. The astronauts then steered it unpowered to a touchdown on the desert floor, duplicating the critical final minutes of a real shuttle flight. With that experience behind him, Col. C. Gordon Fullerton was a natural choice for one of the four crews for the Columbia's orbital test flight program. Another qualification also seems to favor him for the mission. Unlike so many astronauts, who rose from the ranks of jet fighter pilots, Colonel Fullerton spent most of his Air Force career in multi-engine craft, bombers and cargo planes."

But if the winds come up again, the Columbia will be diverted to a touchdown on the concrete runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Having just been forced to cut the second mission short because of one such failure, they conceded that they had created a machine so complex that they had not yet mastered it. So until they developed more confidence, they said, they would have to treat the space shuttle cautiously and gingerly. Last night, as Columbia was preparing to land after completing all the major tasks of its third and next-to-last test flight, Neil Hutchinson, one of the three flight directors who had taken eighthour turns at running the mission, offered this assessment of how far things had come during the last week: ''You have to believe that we're a gigantic step closer to having a vehicle that doesn't require as much babysitting.'' That, said Mr. Hutchinson, ''is what the operations thing is all about.'' None of his assessment was negated by today's one-day postponement of the shuttle's landing, made necessary by high winds at the White Sands, N.M., landing site. In fact, the postponement and the subsequent decision to consider landing at Kennedy Space Center in Florida were taken as evidence of the flexibility with which the shuttle may be able to operate."

If the shuttle lands on the concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California, one of the two sites under consideration if wind conditions rule out a landing at the White Sands Missile Range, there will be no immediate way to unload its various fuels, some of which are lethal or highly volatile. Should the landing be at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as seems more likely, extensive servicing of the vehicle will be possible. Indeed, when the Columbia was launched March 22, the 15,000-foot concrete runway there was prepared to accept a ''returnto-launch-site abort'' if trouble developed in the first few minutes. And, under current plans, the Kennedy strip will eventually serve as one of the two routine landing sites, enabling shuttles to return there directly and be prepared for subsequent flights. On the other hand, Kennedy has a single runway flanked by a moat."

The fact that the Columbia did not land at Cape Canaveral, however, did not mean that the efforts of the ground crews here were wasted. In most shuttle flights of the future, Cape Canaveral, whose runway looks like the flat top of an aircraft carrier compared with the Western sand flats where the Columbia has been landing, will be the regular landing site for nonmilitary missions."

After a 50-minute descent from its orbit of the earth, the winged spaceship hove into view in the blue sky over Mockingbird Gap in the San Andres Mountains, glided east over the desert basin, made a wide right turn and, issuing a sonic boom at 20,000 feet, lined up for the landing. Col. Jack R. Lousma of the Marine Corps, the commander, took over manual control at 100 feet and eased the Columbia's rear wheels onto the gypsum surface a few seconds short of 11:05 A.M. The nose reared up and back like a dragon challenged in combat, possibly a result of Colonel Lousma's trying to brake the rollout or from a sudden gust of wind. Flight controllers could not be sure until they talked to the astronauts. Sandstorm Delayed Landing Then Colonel Lousma, with Col. C. Gordon Fullerton of the Air Force, brought the 100-ton craft to a stop, concluding a mission of eight days and five minutes. The flight was extended an extra day because a sandstorm here made a scheduled landing Mondayimpossible."
