Well, you get something like the Council of Fashion Designers of America's awards dinner last Thursday night, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Temple of Dendur. The cocktail party started with great energy, much of it supplied by Diane Brill, the downtown fashion designer, who delighted the assembled uptown group by wearing a black strapless dress with a strategically placed rhinestone question-mark pin. ''Who is that girl?'' asked Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera and Kenneth Jay Lane in unison. Then the dinner fell flat, with many of the city's top designers not showing up. Worse, there was no music so that at one point it was quiet enough to hear people crunching their couscous. Still, some who attended, including Geraldine Stutz, the president of Henri Bendel, said that the awards, which began as an alternative to the Cotys, could work with more support from the fashion community. And there was some new fashion to be seen, most notably on Marina Schiano, who accepted the women's design award for Calvin Klein. She wore a new Veronica Lake haircut, a new floor-length black shirtdress and no jewelry, a taste of Klein's held- back look for next fall."

Mr. Mondale's forces in Georgia, regarded as not nearly so well organized as in the Northeast, have tried to make sure they get black voters backing their candidate to the polls while at the same time trying not to activate Jackson supporters. The strategy is based on the firm belief that Mr. Jackson's strengh lies among younger, lower-income blacks while Mr. Mondale's is among middle- class blacks 35 years old and over."

Mondale played peacemaker on the campaign trail, warning his rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination that attacks on one another would only hurt the party's chances of beating President Reagan. But last week Mr. Mondale abruptly shelved his speak-no-evil politics. From Boston to Tampa, he denounced Senator Gary Hart as a cold, aloof newcomer who would betray the Democrats' bedrock ideals of fairness and compassion. ''Where's the heart? Where's the guts?'' Mr. Mondale exclaimed as he pressed his argument that Mr. Hart has severe character deficiencies. ''It is not just a horse race,'' he added later in the week. ''This has become a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party and for the future of our country.'' It was also a battle to save the Mondale campaign from total collapse. Mondale strategists acknowledged that the attacks were a last-resort effort to slow the advance of Mr. Hart, who since the Iowa precinct caucuses on Feb. 20 has wiped out Mr. Mondale's standing as the party's front-runner."

The candidates' efforts were spurred by the imminence of a nationally televised debate here Sunday that Mr. Mondale's advisers regard as the most important of four such events this year. Coming after a week in which Mr. Hart consistently gained support across the South, the debate is regarded by Democratic strategists as Mr. Mondale's best and perhaps his final chance to slow Senator Hart's advance before Tuesday. On that day, voters in nine states will join in a round of primaries and caucuses that might dramatically narrow the field of five contenders. Senator Hart's victory in Wyoming was his fourth in a row over Mr. Mondale. With 21 of the state's 23 counties reporting, Senator Hart had 2,086 votes, or 60 percent, to 1,242 for Mr. Mondale, or 36 percent."

      "lead_paragraph": "For John Glenn, the end came quietly, with no brass bands, no chants from supporters, not even a request for an autograph. There were only a news conference in a Congressional hearing room and a few words that were just short of melancholy. As recently as mid-February, Senator Glenn was regarded as the most serious challenger to former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and the Democrat with the best chance of defeating President Reagan. Today, having failed to do better than a weak second in the first dozen political tests of 1984, he withdrew from the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination. ''I'd like nothing better than to stay in this race and compete in every primary, every caucus, and win the nomination of my party,'' he said an hour before he climbed into his own plane to fly to Columbus, Ohio, ''but in the past few weeks it became clear that none of these things is going to happen.'' The removal of Mr. Glenn, who has served Ohio in the Senate for a decade, does more than winnow the number of Democratic candidates to three. It represents rejection of an American hero and is perhaps the most compelling sub-plot in a drama with only three stars now: Senator Gary Hart, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mr. Mondale."
