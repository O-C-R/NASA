The center's 580,000 square feet cost $621 million -- more than double the planned amount. The ceremonial groundbreaking was in 2000. The hall itself is a vast 20,000-square-foot marble-floored plaza with statues standing at its sides, an eccentric collection that includes the gold-draped figure of Kamehameha I (an 18th-century Hawaiian warrior and king) and the space-suited figure of John L. Swigert Jr. (a Colorado-born astronaut on Apollo 13). A towering plaster model for the bronze Statue of Freedom that was mounted on the building's dome 145 years ago on Tuesday stands ceremoniously at the entrance to a 16,500-square-foot exhibition about the history of Congress and the Capitol."

      "lead_paragraph": "Before color photography, and long before the computer made colorization easy, hand-painting with oils and dyes on photographic glass plates was a common way to bring black-and-white images to life. Hand-colored photographs had an otherworldly appearance: not quite real, but close enough to suggest an exotic parallel universe. That made them perfect for travel snapshots -- especially of places already rich in fable and legend. In the Footsteps of Abraham: The Holy Land in Hand-Painted Photographs (Overlook Duckworth, $65), by Richard Hardiman and Helen Speelman, reproduces hundreds of hand-colored pictures taken during the 1920s by the Matson Photo Agency, which was run by American Christian expatriates in Jerusalem. In 1966, those expatriates -- G. Eric Matson and his wife, Edith -- gave their entire photographic collection to the Library of Congress. As the curator George S. Hobart notes in an introductory essay, Eric Matson was devoted to the prints; even years after donating them, he spent long hours ''cleaning, identifying and organizing his beloved group of photographic negatives.''"

When, later on that Christmas Eve in 1968, they read the opening lines of Genesis on live television, they did it with a sense of the heavens and the Earth, of the form and the void, enriched by the wonder they had seen rising into the Moon's black sky."

      "lead_paragraph": "He climbed Kilimanjaro, swam the English Channel, drove a Porsche in the Le Mans and raced sled dogs in the Iditarod. As a senior at Stanford he braved frigid waters to reach Alcatraz Island, unrolled a ''Beat Cal'' banner to taunt his school's rival in the coming Big Game and then swam six hours back, becoming hypothermic. These feats, however impressive, were essentially just dilettante stunts -- after the channel he was teasingly awarded a trophy for the slowest crossing of 1985 -- because though he loved all types of adventures, he excelled in a particular subset. James Stephen Fossett was an aviator, one of the greatest of the modern era. The son of a Procter & Gamble soap-production supervisor, Fossett spent the first half of his adulthood amassing millions of dollars as a commodities trader in Chicago and the second spending that fortune as he notched more than 100 world records and firsts. He holds the record for speed in a zeppelin (71.5 mph) and distance in a plane (25,766 miles without stopping). He was the first to pilot a plane around the world alone without stopping or refueling, outlasting a fuel leak, the failure of his GPS navigation unit and the loss of his emergency oxygen. In 2002, crammed for 14 days inside a capsule so small he couldn't stand up straight, Fossett completed the first solo, nonstop circuit of the globe by balloon. He'd failed on five previous tries. ''He truly was the adventurer's adventurer,'' wrote his friend and frequent expedition sponsor Sir Richard Branson. Had Fossett been born a half-century earlier, tales of his feats would have jockeyed with those of Charles Lindbergh for space on the front page. In the more jaded current era -- ''Is he merely a bored rich guy who is running out of ways to keep himself amused?'' Richard Roeper of The Chicago Sun-Times once carped -- Fossett was only moderately well known. Paradoxically, it took something that the achievement-amassing Fossett didn't do -- show up for lunch on Sept. 3, 2007 -- to make the aviator truly famous."
