Let them chart vicarious adventure by tasting blackened alligator tail or sea urchin mousse at the very best restaurants. To members of the Explorers Club, this is lite adventure. The club's 3,000 members from around the world live to scale mountains or navigate the Amazon, to walk on the Moon or on the ocean floor, and they are as partial to uncharted gastronomic territory as they are to unmapped geography. Delectables like stir-fried grubs, paillard of penguin and braised tiger tidbits are de rigueur at an Explorers Club banquet."

Brown Jr. left an unmistakable imprint on California in his two terms as Governor, with a record of far-sighted achievement when he could realize his own vision, but grand failure in matters requiring him to cooperate with other branches of government. There is broad consensus here, where the Brown legacy can still provoke emotional debate, that the Governor's greatest accomplishment was opening the doors of government to women and minorities and truly integrating the state's highest offices, boards, commissions and judiciary. Mr. Brown served from 1975 through 1982, and his appointees have put in motion pioneering air quality standards, energy conservation programs and consumer protections that became models for the rest of the nation."

Yes, of serious women too. Washington and \"the system\" now have serious women galore.
