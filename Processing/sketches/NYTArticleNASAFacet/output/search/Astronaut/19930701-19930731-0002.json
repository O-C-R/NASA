Earlier that year, a similar explosion at the University of California at Berkeley blew the fingers off Capt. John E. Hauser's right hand, ending the flying career of the ambitious young Air Force pilot and engineering student and shattering his dream of becoming an astronaut."

And displayed in the window of the town's bookstore was \"The Magic of Theater\" (18 conversations with 33 actors, conducted by David Black). \"I want to become a star,\" said a 9-year-old browser named Kirsten to Mr. Black when he showed up for the book signing. Mr. Black may not be able to tell Kirsten, whose mother bought a signed copy, exactly how to become a star, but the ones quoted in the book might offer some inspiration along the way. William Hurt, for one, talks of theater as a communal experience of strangers bravely solving their humanity together."
