      "lead_paragraph": "A private corporation with only seven permanent employees launched a spacecraft made out of surplus rocket parts from a cattle ranch here today, ushering in what its promoters believe will be a new era of commercial exploitation of space technology. The gleaming white craft, carrying a mock payload of 40 gallons of water, lifted off dramatically with a roar and a puff of white smoke at 10:17 A.M. It sketched a high parabola over the choppy waters of the Gulf of Mexico and splashed down 321 miles from this barren island 10 1/2 minutes later. The successful test flight of the 36-foot rocket, symbolically named Conestoga 1 after the covered wagons used by American pioneers, was a pivotal event for its owner, Space Services Inc. of America. The Houston-based concern had persuaded 57 investors to chip in $6 million on the argument that the time had come for private enterprise to get a piece of the action in space, which has long been dominated by governments. Plan to Launch Satellite The company's chairman, David Hannah Jr., a Texas real estate developer and space enthusiast, said the company was now prepared to push ahead with plans for the first privately launched satellite in 1984. Space Services hopes to sell ''low-cost, market-oriented'' space services that are tailored specifically to meet the needs of oil companies and other potential customers needing satellite tracking and communication."

According to a Space Services official who was there, Mr. Wynne simply pointed to one of his oil rigs and said, ''It's a lot less risky than that business over there.'' With such disregard for the risks and the skeptics, Space Services, a Houston company backed largely by Texas businessmen, took a giant step yesterday toward convincing the world that a private company might one day compete with the National Aeronatics and Space Administration in launching satellites into space. From a ranch in Texas, it successfully launched a spaceship made of surplus rocket parts."

But another incumbent, Senator Howard W. Cannon of Nevada, was locked in a tight race with Representative James D. Santini as he sought the Democratic nomination for a fifth term. In Massachusetts, former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, attacking his successor's administration as corrupt and too supportive of President Reagan, defeated the incumbent, Gov. Edward J. King, for the Democratic nomination for Governor, just as Mr. King did four years ago when Mr. Dukakis was the incumbent. In the heavily Democratic Bay State, Mr. Dukakis will be favored over the Republican nominee in November, John W. Sears, a former Boston City Councilor."

A new exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum, ''Black Wings: The American Black in Aviation,'' traces the involvement of blacks in aviation from Eugene Bullard's service in France in World War I to the four black astronauts assigned to the space shuttle program. Lieut. Col. Guion S. Bluford Jr. will be the first black astronaut in space on the eighth shuttle flight, tentatively scheduled for next year. The exhibit, made up mainly of pictures and mementos, is the first that the museum has devoted to blacks and depicts an era about which little is known. Trained in France The exhibition describes how the first licensed black American pilots had to go to France to receive their training. Eugene Bullard, for instance, failed in his effort to break the racial barrier in aviation in this country and joined the Foreign Legion in 1914, according to historical accounts. He went on to become a pilot with the Lafayette Escadrille in World War I and received 15 medals, including the French Legion of Honor."
