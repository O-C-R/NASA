The telephone never stopped trilling and, four days after she was nominated as best supporting actress for her performance as the artist Lee Krasner in the film ''Pollock,'' every available surface was crowded with enormous floral arrangements from producers, agents and industry honchos. The bowl of beautiful pink roses and lavender sweet peas was from Winona Ryder, whom Ms. Harden doesn't even know. Taped to the front door and over the mantel were full-color trade-paper ads congratulating her. Perhaps Ms. Harden was feeling self-conscious about the wall art. She got up from her brown leather couch and began pulling down the makeshift banners. ''Thad? Honey?'' Ms. Harden called out to Thaddaeus Scheel, her husband of six years."

There are also real items like a space suit worn by Neil Armstrong. Some of the featured artists, including Paul Calle, who lives in Stamford and has a studio in Ridgefield, participated in NASA's art program, which was started in 1963. In 1969, Mr. Calle designed the United States postage stamp that commemorated the first landing on the moon. Recently Mr. Calle talked about his involvement with that program, his art and other matters."

Mir lasted far longer than expected, becoming the longest-running manned platform ever mounted in space and a significant contributor to scientific knowledge. Now the 135-ton Mir is coming down, its re-entry to Earth's atmosphere and inevitable destruction scheduled for later this week. Its demise -- dictated by creaky components and lack of money to upgrade them -- will remove the last remaining symbol of Russia's glory days in space."

Tiger Electronics, a division of Hasbro, showed off no less than two dozen interactive robotic toys that it plans to unleash next holiday season. They include a free-ranging turtle and other automatons for the fish bowl, as well as a gleaming, robotic baby that coos while responding to touch, sight and sound. There were plenty of robotic toys from other manufacturers, too: more dogs than you can throw a stick at, joined by cats, birds, mice, bugs, dinosaurs and even potted plants."

The controlled descent, which ended Mir's 15-year-career as an orbiting laboratory for Soviet and then Russian science, was managed with remarkable precision by the Russian space agency at Mission Control here near Moscow. Fifteen minutes before the scheduled splashdown, Russian officials announced that an American ground station on Guam had confirmed that Mir was descending through the atmosphere according to plan, following a final burn of its retro-rocket system."
