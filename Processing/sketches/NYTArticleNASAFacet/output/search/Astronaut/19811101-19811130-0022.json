Col. Joe H. Engle of the Air Force and Capt. Richard H. Truly of the Navy flew T-38 jet trainers from the Johnson Space Center at Houston to Patrick Air Force Base near here. They landed at 2:45 P.M., made brief statements about the Columbia being ready and ''the greatest'' and went to the Kennedy Space Center for final briefings and relaxation. ''We're mighty glad we're getting this close to flying,'' said Colonel Engle, the mission commander. The mission was originally scheduled for a Sept. 30 launching, then reset for Oct. 9 and postponed again because of a propellant spill that damaged the outer surface of the Columbia's forward fuselage."

The space shuttle's ejection seats, similar to those used successfully for pilots flying high-performance aircraft, would be far more useful should there be an emergency in the Columbia's approach for landing, according to officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Once activated, and only in dire emergency, the D-shaped-ring positioned between the astronauts' legs detonates explosive devices that catapult the crew from their seats through escape panels in the cockpit ceiling. They would be sent spinning away from the spacecraft, with parachutes opening to ease their escape descent."

The United States has invested at least $10 billion so far to develop the Columbia as a vehicle capable of perhaps 100 round trips to space, and, depending on its success in early test flights, a fleet of four shuttles is expected to be in operation by the middle of the decade. The planned five-day mission, to be flown by Col. Joe H. Engle of the Air Force and Capt. Richard H. Truly of the Navy, will be marked by the first working payload of scientific instruments to be carried by the 122-foot-long winged spaceplane and extensive testing of the vehicle's 50-foot robot arm for handling cargoes."

IF art is, among other things, a spiritual survival manual for its times, then new styles of art are inventive responses to new problems of survival. The problem we face right now is how to find and hold a center of human meaning in a world where values and institutions are not just falling but flying apart. It seems to me that a new style of popular art has appeared to instruct us, exemplified in the dramatic media by television's superb ''Hill Street Blues'' and in fiction by Joyce Rebeta-Burditt's second novel, ''Triplets.''"

There was only a small audience, although the fire and groundshaking thunder were no less impressive than in April, when close to a million people crowded round to see the maiden flight. Local law-enforcement officials estimated that fewer than 100,000 people came out this time, and most of them were in vans with Florida tags. The reason for the low number, local residents reckoned, was either fear of another postponement, or ennui."

He has piloted some of the most sophisticated equipment this country has produced, including the X-15 research rocket plane early in the 1960's. Yesterday he took off in the space shuttle Columbia. Through it all, he has retained an affection for the relatively unsophisticated airplanes used when he was growing up in World War II. He is especially fascinated with the Curtiss P-40, which he has flown. It was widely used by the command of Brig. Gen. Claire L. Chennault in the war over China and Burma, where the Japanese lost 299 planes in seven months. Planes captured his imagination and he once said, ''I can't remember when I didn't want to fly airplanes and be a fighter pilot.''"

Though Captain Truly has won more than his share of medals and citations as a pilot and astronaut, flying has not always been an all-consuming passion, as it has for Col. Joe H. Engle of the Air Force, his shuttle partner. ''He had no particular aspirations to become a pilot when he was a boy,'' said his father, James B. Truly, who is a retired lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission. His son agrees."

During questioning, Mr. Haig refused to rule out a possible blockade of Nicaragua. (Page A1, Column 3.) Exxon is withdrawing from Libya after 26 years of pumping crude oil there. Spokesmen for Exxon, the largest American oil company, declined repeated requests to explain whether the decision was taken because of a dispute with Libya over oil production or prices or because of political or security reasons.

It is as familiar and mundane a fixture to an astronaut as an automobile battery is to a motorist. And until today, none had ever failed with major consequences. This time, it forced mission controllers to consider reducing the duration of Columbia's second flight, perhaps by as much as half."

As the Columbia soared into sight over the Mojave Desert, announcing itself with thudding sonic booms, tens of thousands of people peered upward from the perimeter of the Rogers Dry Lake landing site. They cheered as the glistening white craft glided over the desert, made a wide sweeping turn and put down on the hard desert floor."

About an hour into the flight, one of Columbia's three fuel cells signaled abnormal temperature and acid levels. The trouble persisted, forcing shutdown of the obdurate equipment and, as safety rules dictate, curtailment of the mission to ''the minimum'' - 54 hours, or 36 orbits, instead of the originally scheduled 124 hour, or 83-orbit flight."

      "lead_paragraph": "After a preliminary inspection, space agency officials said today that the space shuttle Columbia suffered ''considerably less'' visible wear and tear on its second flight than on its first. They said it should be ready for another trip in March. Only 12 of the craft's 31,000 heat-protective tiles were known to be damaged and to require replacement, compared with 164 tiles that were ripped off or damaged in the Columbia's first flight last April, presumably because there was not so much pressure at liftoff, employees said. Donald K. Slayton, the astronaut who is manager of the orbital test program, said at a news conference here that the winged spaceship ''looks superb, looks considerably better than after the first flight, with considerably less damage.''"
