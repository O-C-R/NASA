There were no memorial services or dedications, no speeches to give, no pressure to be a national ''symbol of strength,'' as Mrs. Ramon said. It was just the two friends, ''soul mates'' in their words, sipping bowls of cappuccino, building a campfire in the woods, talking quietly about raising children alone, or not talking at all. Over dessert one night, Mrs. Ramon, the widow of Col. Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli astronaut to go into space, turned to Mrs. McCool, the widow of Cmdr. William C. McCool, the Columbia's pilot, and said, ''They were the best.''"

Its 12 1/2-day mission will be the most photographed in the history of the shuttle program, with all eyes on the craft to see if it suffered the kind of damage from blastoff debris that brought down the Columbia in February 2003. There were cameras on the launching pad, cameras aloft on planes monitoring the ascent, cameras on the shuttle checking for missing foam on the external fuel tank, and a camera on the tank itself. One camera caught a mysterious object falling from the shuttle at liftoff; radar detected another, about two minutes into the flight. Cameras aboard the shuttle and the International Space Station will monitor the Discovery until the end of its mission."

Among the writers scheduled to give readings and sign books are the astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the presidential biographer David McCullough, E.L. Doctorow, Tom Clancy and Sandra Brown. R.W.

Discussions and readings from the History and Biography pavilion will be broadcast live from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on C-SPAN2, the library said. (The program will be shown again at 8 p.m.) JOHN FILES"
