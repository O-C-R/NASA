However the criminal charges are ultimately resolved, there is already a clear lesson of this bizarre case: astronauts are human, subject to the same marital strains and mental aberrations that afflict more ordinary mortals. The space agency may need to revise its procedures for screening the psychological health of astronauts -- particularly those who might embark on long space trips. The agency is taking precisely the right action in beginning reviews of its screening procedures, from the time of application into the retirement years."

First, the world's supply of black stockings will soon surely be exhausted, if designers in New York have not used them all up already. And second, just because Miuccia Prada didn't show any pants for spring does not mean no one else can for fall. It has been a big week for black tights at Factory Girl Fashion Week. Brian Wolk and Claude Morais, the designers of the rich girl/rough girl collection called Ruffian, said they searched high and low for the right black tights, even looking in stripper supply stores, and finally had to have them shipped overnight from Los Angeles for their show. The general effect of the legless look from the posse of new designers storming the gates of fashion was to emphasize whatever the models wore on top."

When she arrives home to an engraved cocktail party invitation from him and his wife, she knows exactly how to respond. She goes to a fancy food shop and buys a box of chocolate truffles, the kind he gave her after their first tryst. She takes the tumor she has kept as a souvenir, dusts it with cocoa powder, nestles it in the elaborately wrapped box, and sends it to her lover with a note expressing her regrets. Gruesome, bizarre, the kind of thing only fiction could imagine."

Mr. Thornton, a bit less gaunt than usual, plays Charles Farmer -- even his wife calls him by his last name -- who is not a farmer at all, but rather a rancher in the small town of Story, Tex. That, at any rate, is his job, but Farmer's true calling is space travel. In the face of local skepticism and government interference, he builds a rocket in his barn and makes plans to blast into orbit. The tone of the film (directed by Michael Polish, who wrote and produced it with his brother) is wide-eyed and unapologetically sentimental. Story is a quirky, friendly place, where Farmer's obsession is viewed with tolerant affection that only occasionally shades into exasperation. With another actor in the title role (Kevin Costner, say, just off the top of my head) the mawkishness would be unbearable, but Mr. Thornton can be relied upon for understated dignity accompanied by an intriguing undertone of serious craziness."
