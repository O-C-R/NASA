      "lead_paragraph": "La MaMa Moves! Dance Festival, now in its sixth year, is frustratingly exhaustive, the kind of event that is overrun with too many mixed bills. But on Friday night there was an exception: Lance Gries, a former member of the Trisha Brown Dance Company, presented a new solo, his first show in New York in 10 years. ''Etudes for an Astronaut,'' described in program notes as ''one man's search for his place in the universe,'' was already in motion as the audience entered La MaMa's intimate club space. In head-to-toe black and flip-flops Mr. Gries repeated a movement sequence that gave his body -- through deceptively simple means of sitting, standing, leaning and rolling -- a sense of melting and hardening. In ''Etudes'' he is searching for balance between inner space (as in the mind) and outer space (the world). As Mr. Gries grappled with his many tasks (these included peeling off layers of clothes so that by the end he wore only a pair of shorts), there was absoluteness of intention. But while he showed he was able to expose raw nerves with great subtlety -- this has to do with the split-second shifts that his body undergoes throughout the performance -- he also drifted into a sketchy area of self-help. In ''Etudes'' there is a gap, in other words, between what he's doing and how he does it."

You just get old,'' a testy Philip is shown barking at the hapless interviewer, Alan Titchmarsh, who has just mentioned an award the prince received from The Oldie magazine. Asked if it was hard to give up his naval career when his wife became queen, Philip snorts, ''How long is a piece of string?''"

They not only reflected America's anticipation of Apollo 11 -- the first manned lunar landing, which would take place in July of that year -- but also drew on the relationship between NASA and the ''Peanuts'' gang. That connection is the subject of ''To the Moon: Snoopy Soars With NASA,'' now on view at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center. The exhibition made its debut in 2009 at the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa, Calif., to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 10 mission, which took place in May 1969 as a dress rehearsal for Apollo 11. The Apollo 10 crew had chosen ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'' as the respective call names for their command and lunar modules. While the astronaut John W. Young orbited the moon in ''Charlie Brown,'' Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene A. Cernan piloted ''Snoopy'' within 50,000 feet of the moon's surface to scout a landing area for Apollo 11."

Last year, Mattel, the doll's maker, released ''Mad Men'' versions, giving Barbie a pile of fire-red hair and a fetching office-girl dress in her Joan Holloway incarnation. Now, high art is taking a turn at a makeover. Three Barbies have just been released, inspired by great paintings, Tablet Magazine reported. One takes a crack at Mona Lisa -- a long overdue role for Barbie -- though the doll itself, with heavy eyeliner and a shower of curls, looks more like a model in an ad for a Renaissance fair. Another doll is inspired by Van Gogh's ''Starry Night,'' a painting that does not happen to feature a woman, so the Barbie is simply a blonde with a ''Starry Night''-print strapless gown.Undoubtedly the strangest of the three is the Barbie based on Gustav Klimt's ''Portrait of Adele Bloch I,'' the Viennese Secessionist masterpiece that Ronald Lauder bought for what some reported to be $135 million in 2006, one of the highest prices ever paid for an artwork. The Barbie, with a winged hairdo and a dress that gets the dazzling Byzantine mosaic pattern from the painting almost right -- minus Klimt's gold-leaf -- goes for $34.95."
