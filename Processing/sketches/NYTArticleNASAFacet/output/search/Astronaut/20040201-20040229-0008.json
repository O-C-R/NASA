The idea is not to produce a program that everyone will enjoy. The idea is to produce a program that no one wants to miss. Yesterday's halftime show, organized by MTV, neatly illustrated the difference between these two ideas. The show itself was a rather uninspired medley of hits by Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake and others. But it ended with a moment that may generate more discussion than the game itself. Timberlake ripped off the right side of Jackson's bustier; the result was the day's most spectacular fumble."

Like every marriage, this one has had its ups and downs, and it seems to be ending like ''The War of the Roses.'' NASA officials moved as swiftly as assassins after President Bush ordered them to redirect resources toward the Moon and Mars. Without service calls from shuttle astronauts, the telescope is likely to die in orbit around 2007, making science the first casualty of the new era. Not an auspicious beginning."

Officials of the agency had already indicated recently that the next shuttle flight, tentatively scheduled for September or October, would probably be moved to early 2005 because more time was needed for modifications. And Thursday night those officials said they were now aiming for a date between early March and mid-April of next year."
