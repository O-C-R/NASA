      "lead_paragraph": "Texas Air's $600 million bid for Eastern shook up the passenger carrier industry and carries long-term implications for the post-deregulation era. Frank Lorenzo, Texas Air's chairman, is aiming to build a major route system by combining Eastern's modern fleet with his smaller Continental and New York Air operations. That would probably require him to divest some of the Washington-New York-Boston shuttle routes that New York Air has been working to build against Eastern's shuttle. But the cost-cutting for which Mr. Lorenzo has become known in the industry promises continued fare competition. Eastern was pressured into the sale by its creditors - who loaned it the money to modernize - and its unions. The unions, which represent half the carrier's workers, own about 20 percent of Eastern, which they got in return for past concessions. They have balked at further cuts, saying Eastern's chairman, Frank Borman, is looking in the wrong place. Creditors, meanwhile, say the carrier still must get more concessions or they will force it to default. Mr. Borman is hoping Texas Air will help Eastern out of the muddle. Although the unions say the deal is ill-advised, and seek Mr. Borman's ouster, Mr. Lorenzo said he will keep the former astronaut on board - for now."

Charles F. Bolden Jr. of the Marine Corps, said in an interview. His comments came as the 95 full-time members of the nation's astronaut corps began resuming public appearances after a monthlong self-imposed silence about the explosion Jan. 28 of the Challenger, which killed seven of their colleagues. Colonel Bolden said he was not surprised by reports of problems with the joints of the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets, which are suspected as a major cause of the explosion."

[ Page A1, Column 6. ] A West Bank Mayor was shot dead as he was walking from his home to City Hall. A spokesman for the Israeli Civil Administration in the occupied territories said Mayor Zafer el-Masri of Nablus, a Palestinian appointed by Israel who was regarded as an alternative to the slogans of the Palestine Liberation Organization, had been killed by a single assailant. The central area of Nablus was under curfew, and access to the city was blocked by the Israeli army. [ A1:2. ] Palestinians in Israel-occupied land say they have been stunned, dismayed and frightened by the rupture in the yearlong effort by King Hussein and Yasir Arafat to devise a joint position on Middle East talks. Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip say they were even more disconcerted by King Hussein's call on them last week to decide who should lead them. [ A3:1. ] A cut in Brazil's interest rate on nearly a third of the country's foreign debt was agreed on by a group of international banks which made $31 billion in loans. The agreement was reached Saturday night after about a month of negotiations and a day after President Jose Sarney ordered sweeping economic changes to combat Brazil's soaring inflation."

Now, these sources contend, the Presidential commission is preparing to open a new phase of the inquiry. It will focus on an increasingly complicated set of technical issues surrounding joints in the right-hand booster rocket of the Challenger craft and unresolved questions related to possible financial or other pressures on the space agency to sustain an ambitious launching schedule. As the panel completed a week of closed and public hearings at the Kennedy Space Center, it had crossed many items off a long list of potential causes for the accident, including the shuttle orbiter and the main engines."

In an enclosure Mr. Young gave what he called an ''awesome'' list of safety-related problems that he said ''ought to be fixed so that we do not lose any more space shuttles and flight crews.'' 'Some Very Lucky People' ''Many of these potentially serious conditions were discovered after we started operating,'' Mr. Young, a veteran astronaut, wrote. ''On an individual basis, they were not big enough to slow or stop the launch rates. But totally, this list is awesome. The list proves to me that there are some very lucky people around here.''"

The enclosure lists some conditions and events that are present in the space shuttle program at this time. These are not all the conditions of serious concern. These situations increase, to some unquantifiable and unassessable extent, the space shuttle program, the space shuttle, and the flight crew risk. I have talked to individuals - working level and mid-level engineers, operators, and managers - who are seriously concerned about each of these accepted situations in their areas of specialty. These accepted conditions could have been or are now potentially as catastrophic to the space shuttle program as the 51-L accident."

''It was 30 years ago,'' Mr. Sagdeyev, the physicist who heads the Space Research Institute, said last week. ''I was very young. I was looking at them as extraterrestrials,'' Barely pausing, he added, ''Throughout my career, I felt very close to my American colleagues.'' For Mr. Sagdeyev, the Americans are extraterrestrials no more. He is more than comfortable looking them in the eye."

Efforts were under way tonight to retrieve the cabin debris, which is resting in 100 feet of water about 15 miles northeast of here, and to return the remains for positive identification, the officials said. Late tonight, a Navy spokesman would neither confirm nor deny reports that some of the astronauts' remains had been brought ashore. Families Were Notified ''On Saturday morning, after securing operations during the night for safety reasons, the U.S.S. Preserver, whose divers are thoroughly briefed on debris identification and who have participated in similar recovery operations, began to work,'' the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a statement issued here today. ''Subsequent dives provided positive identification of Challenger crew compartment debris and the existence of crew remains.''"

For telecommunications executives or those hoping to develop products in the weightless conditions of space, questions about what caused the Challenger explosion are bound up with worries about when the shuttles may fly again. Anthony J. Cipriano is chairman of the Space Commerce Roundtable Foundation, established last October by the New York Society of Securities Analysts, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Financial Women's Association of New York and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The foundation grew out of five years of informal meetings by these groups as they followed the progress of commercial space ventures. Q. When do you see flights resuming? A. We are most likely looking at a year's delay, depending on what actions are taken to correct the most glaring problem - the seam between the fuel cell and the engine. There are 40 solutions under consideration. Whether it was the cause of the accident or not, we know that has to be fixed."

Resnik, said the agency believed that some of the bodies could be identified despite decomposition. Compartment Ruptured Carl McNair, whose son Dr. Ronald E.

Among the questions are whether the five men and two women aboard died instantly, without warning, in the fireball that engulfed the Challenger 74 seconds after liftoff Jan. 28, or whether they were aware in those final terrifying seconds that their ship was breaking apart. An astronaut, speaking on the condition that he not be identified, said today that as the shuttle ascended ''an auditory and warning light may have come on, but by the time they could have done anything, the ship was disintegrating.'' The stark visual impression was that everything was going smoothly until the spacecraft suddenly, and without warning, vaporized. This impression was reinforced by the absence of any frantic, last-minute transmissions from the shuttle."

Under a new policy, prompted by a Federal interagency group in the six weeks since the explosion of the Challenger shuttle, the space agency will move to encourage private space companies to launch satellites that previously would have been sent aloft by the space shuttles. Until the Jan. 28 explosion of the shuttle, with the loss of seven crew members, the space agency had consistently opposed using expendable unmanned rockets to put military and commercial satellites in orbit, saying its four shuttles were the best and most competitive vehicles for that purpose. 'Consensus Is Emerging' But in a memorandum to Richard Truly, the new director of shuttle operations, William R. Graham, NASA's Acting Administrator, wrote last Friday that ''a consensus is emerging'' within the Reagan Administration to rely increasingly on the unmanned rockets, known as expendable launch vehicles."

For several years, private launching companies, which under the new policy would send up communications satellites on unmanned rockets, have been battling opposition from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which argued they were superfluous. But with the Jan. 28 loss of the Challenger, the space agency has come to what analysts have called an inevitable conclusion: Without this industry, the shuttle capacity would not be enough to send aloft a growing list of private satellites. The policy shift was confirmed by the space agency on Tuesday. The private companies, however, will not be ready to launch for at least two years. While France and other nations pushed ahead with unmanned launching technology, the American unmanned rocket program has been nearly dormant and it will take that long to build the rockets and make the other arrangements necessary for a launching. Even then, the experts say, unmanned rockets will have a limited ability to replace the space shuttle."

One exception, which occurred in an unusual context, was when Soviet astronauts took off in a Soyuz spacecraft to rendezvous with American astronauts in an Apollo craft in 1975. Launchings of flights that carried French and Indian crew members were televised live."

Since the first remains were recovered last weekend, the work had been done at Patrick Air Force Base about 25 miles south of the space center. On Wednesday night the Navy recovery ship that had found the crew compartment of the Challenger slipped quietly into port, and with solemn ceremony containers from the ship were transferred to shore. As honor guards stood watch, sailors wearing dress uniforms unloaded the material that had been lifted from the crew cabin of the Challenger, and about 30 minutes later a convoy of ambulances sped off, lights flashing."

Their mission could well mark the start of the time when humans take up a more or less permanent occupation of space. If all goes well when the astronauts reach the orbiting station, scheduled for Saturday, they would get to work preparing the Mir to serve as the core for an assortment of modules to be attached later and thus provide ample working space for a variety of activities in biology, materials processing, astrophysics and earth observation, according to American authorities on the Soviet space program. Launching Is Telecast All appeared to go well with the launching, which was telecast live throughout the Soviet Union. [ Page A16. ] The American experts described the Mir as a ''major advance'' over the experimental Salyut stations that the Soviet Union has used for nearly 15 years in demonstrating the ability of humans to live and work for long periods in orbit, up to nine months. Soviet officials themselves have said that the Mir marks ''the beginning of a transition from research and experiments to large-scale production activities in outer space.''"

They told a Senate investigating panel that a critical report they prepared in 1984 had been withheld and altered to put ''a more favorable light'' on the aviation agency and the airline, which was then going through a bitter strike by its pilots and a bankruptcy reorganization. Defending the handling of the report, Anthony J. Broderick, the agency's associate administrator for aviation standards, testified that he had ordered the Continental inspection report rewritten ''to remove unwarranted and unsubstantiated'' findings. He contended that none of the violations found had been stricken from a version put out later."

Fifty seconds later, as the voice of the controller reported that ''the flight is normal,'' the television shifted to cameras inside the Soyuz T-15 craft and showed Col. Leonid D. Kizim, the commander, and Vladimir Solovyov, the flight engineer, cradled in their space suits and apparently at ease. At 120 seconds, as the controller announced the separation of the first stage, the astronauts were visibly jolted. The transmission continued until the 270th second, when the crew was reported safely in orbit."

The evening television news program showed the two astronauts laughing and frolicking in the spacious cabin of the Mir soon after boarding, and proudly showing off its trappings with a hand-held television camera. As the telecast opened, Colonel Kizim seemed to be doing a somersault, while a laughing Mr. Solovyev told the mission controllers, ''So, are you convinced now that we're here?'' Light-Hearted Broadcast The interview continued with a gaiety and lightness unusual for Soviet space broadcasts, and the astronauts appeared to be genuinely excited about the new station. Colonel Kizim and Mr. Solovyev, along with another astronaut, Dr. Oleg Atkov, had spent a record of 238 days in space aboard the Salyut-7 orbiting lab, a station considerably more cramped than the Mir."

But it happened in the tiny village (pop. 300) of Oude Niedorp, a one-windmill town about 35 miles northwest of Amsterdam. And after a month of newspaper and television interviews, Geert Hageman, the 29-year-old horticulturist who developed the new black tulip, is still euphoric about this somber variety of his national flower. A tulip of this hue is exceedingly rare, and in the Netherlands, where about $150 million worth of tulip bulbs and $100 million in cut tulips are produced a year, the tulip's potential profits are significant. ''It was about 12:30 on Feb. 18th,'' Mr. Hageman recounted. ''I had already looked once or twice at this group of tulips, and then I saw it. I couldn't tell anybody - my wife was sleeping - so I walked around drinking a beer. The next morning I took the tulip in to the West Frisian Flora show at Bovenkarspel.'' At this event, the Netherlands' most prestigious bulb-flower display, his tulip was a show stopper. That night Mr. Hageman, a tall man with an innocent and sturdy gaze, appeared on his first television show."

Members of an independent panel of rocket experts arrived at the Morton Thiokol's Wasatch Division plant today to begin evaluating the tests on the design of the O rings that seal the joints of the booster rockets. The tests include firing small-scale rocket motors in order to subject scaled-down cross-sections of booster segments to conditions similar to those the full-size rockets experienced the day the Challenger blew up with its crew of seven, said a company spokesman, Gil Moore."

Senior agency officials said in interviews that up to nine shuttle launchings are tentatively scheduled, including one from a military base in California. Five to seven of the flights are devoted to the military, depending on how particular payloads are defined. The Mix Is Shifting Officials emphasized that there would be no shuttle launchings until the problem that destroyed the Challenger and killed its seven crew members had been discovered and fixed."

I was watching the news and I saw your children say, 'Don't go, Mom,' and I'm sure they are very unhappy. I wish I could help you and your family. Sincerely yours, Mike Bonanno.'' Mental health experts say this letter and thousands like it show that many children experienced the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher-astronaut, as the symbolic loss of a mother and that they may have been more deeply disturbed by this loss than they let on otherwise. The very act of writing the letters was a way for many children to heal emotional wounds, the experts say."
