The Discovery and its crew of three men and two women bolted from a launching pad into a bright Florida sun at 9:41 A.M. after a 55-second delay because of concerns about a radio receiver on the shuttle's fuel tank. When it was determined that the device was working properly, the countdown continued."

An informal survey of college bookstores around the country yields a best-seller list that is fraught with contradictions. Some titles, tony and highbrow, suggest that America's colleges really are coaching the best and the brightest for victory in a highly competitive world economy. There are others -- many of them, in fact -- that paint a different picture of the college population."

Cast changes, most notably the departure of Rob Morrow, who played the central and somewhat irritating character of whiny Joel Fleischman, proved fatal. In tonight's wrap-up, several major players like John Cullum's Holling, Janine Turner's Maggie and John Corbett's Chris barely muster enough energy to put in brief appearances. All of which shouldn't detract from the inventiveness and accomplishments of \"Northern Exposure\" at its best. When Joel, a New Yorker and recent medical-school graduate, arrived in the outpost town of Cicely, Alaska, to pay off scholarship obligations, a wonderfully offbeat community sprouted up in prime time. The barmy residents were the brainchildren of Joshua Brand and John Falsey, the creative team whose other credits include \"St. Elsewhere.\""
