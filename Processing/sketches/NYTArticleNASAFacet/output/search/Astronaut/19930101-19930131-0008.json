But participants believe the crash offers a painful object lesson not only for balloonists but for planners of such complex systems as future space missions. Earthwinds, a 300-foot-high assemblage resembling a gigantic hourglass, was designed to fly nonstop around the world to achieve the last major landmark in lighter-than-air aviation. The craft and its three-member crew rose majestically above a snow-covered Nevada airfield last Tuesday to the cheers of a crowd that included former astronauts, champion balloonists, actors, business executives, airplane pilots, aeronautical engineers, systems analysts and other experts. But the shimmering, translucent balloon scarcely covered five miles before scraping a ridge line on the California-Nevada border and crash-landing on its farther slope."

      "lead_paragraph": "WHAT: A curious, cross-pollination of surfboard, ski and skateboard. A wood-core, fiberglass-wrapped board that is 5 to 6 feet long and 6 to 11 inches wide. Bindings strap the feet in, one foot in front of the other, toes turned inward. Cost: $375 to $600. WHO'S DOING IT: Industry estimates vary, but the majority of snowboarders are teen-agers or in their 20's. Thirty-eight percent of snowboarders are between 6 and 18, said Lee Crane, managing editor of \"Transworld Snowboard Magazine,\" in Oceanside, Calif. \"It's like rock 'n' roll: kids are in the vanguard.\" Of late, it's been taken up by those in their fourth decade."
