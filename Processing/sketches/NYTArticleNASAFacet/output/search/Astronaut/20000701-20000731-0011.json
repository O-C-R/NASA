During the visit, they met the horticulturalist Larry Burkam, who was working on the woman's property, and they all ended up having dinner. ''And you could just see the lightning bolts over the table,'' Mr. Podeswa recalled recently. ''When we got back to the hotel that night, I looked at Camelia and said, 'You know, I have the funniest feeling that you're going to marry that guy.' ''"

The eponymous Tuff of Paul Beatty's new novel is a smart small-time hoodlum from the streets of East Harlem who sees things as they are and whose dreams that they might be different smash up against the jagged edges of reality. He is 19, married and the father of a small boy, and he is surrounded by a cast of characters who, like Tuff himself, are outside the usual categories. His best friend is a disabled anti-Semitic black Muslim who is always coming up with get-rich schemes, legal and otherwise. His father is a cant-spouting former Black Panther who begins poetry readings by firing shotgun shells into the auditorium ceiling. His self-appointed mentor is a black rabbi named Spencer Throckmorton, who converted to Judaism to marry his college sweetheart and became a rabbi even though she later left him. Tuff, whose real name is Winston Foshay, decides about midway through Mr. Beatty's satirical ghetto romp to run for city council, raising money by working in a three-card monte scam in midtown Manhattan."

Giant insects sculptured from scrap metal, apocalyptic visions painted on fence slats, a flower bed in the shape of a heart: these things become folk art when documented, but in their own backyards they're magically animate. This home-birthed art has its equivalents in rock, including a recent style influenced by Pavement, the band out of Stockton, Calif. Literary and homespun, dilapidated and grand, it allows outsider auteurs to present epics on a foundation of bent guitar chords. Grandaddy, Home and Bright Eyes, leading lights of this backyard school, played on Friday night at the Bowery Ballroom. Grandaddy blithely acknowledged its debt with a Pavement cover halfway through its set, but this band, from Modesto, Calif., benefited equally from other preoccupations. Jason Lytle, Grandaddy's mastermind, stood behind a bank of seemingly broken-down vintage keyboards with a guitar decorated with taped-on foliage around his neck. He looked like a mad scientist of the forest, making music in a dusky space where the organic meets the digital."
