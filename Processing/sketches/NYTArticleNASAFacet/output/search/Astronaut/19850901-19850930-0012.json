But, as expected, the slow performance of the space shuttle Discovery's mechanical arm prevented the astronauts from completing the job. They plan another excursion outside the cabin Sunday morning to wrap up the repairs and redeploy the satellite. At a news conference at the Johnson Space Center in Houston after the repair maneuvers, William Reeves, a flight director, said: ''We had an extremely successful day. But we have another tough day ahead of us.''"

''There that bad boy goes,'' the astronaut said as he watched the departing 15,000-pound satellite, sunlight glinting off the solar cells that cover its exterior. The successful redeployment of the communications satellite came at the end of the second space walk in two days by Dr. van Hoften and Dr. William F. Fisher of the space shuttle Discovery. They spent four and a half hours outside the cabin today, completing the repairs begun in an arduous seven-hour operation Saturday."

After a simulated mission in space that lasted two and a half hours, they were bringing the orbiter home. Suddenly an adolescent voice came over the radio from Mission Control: ''Challenger, there's a 747 already on the runway in front of you. Please go back into orbit.''"

      "lead_paragraph": "ANYONE mildly good at ''Trivial Pursuit'' knows - if very little else about the man -that Edward Lear wrote ''The Owl and the Pussy-Cat,'' among many other deathless bits of English ephemera. Yet it was mainly as a painter - of flora, fauna and landscapes - that Lear made a reputation during his lifetime (1812-1888), and it was as a painter that he wanted to be remembered. When he died, this versatile workaholic managed to leave more than 300 oils, thousands of watercolors, two books of natural history illustrations, and more than 100 lithographs of birds - all this besides published travel and ''Nonsense'' books, manuscripts, songs, diaries and a wealth of amusingly illustrated letters to friends. The growing interest in the 19th century, and the approaching centenary of Lear's birth, prompted the Royal Academy of Arts - lukewarm to Lear in his lifetime - to mount the first full survey of his work earlier this summer in London. Originally a show of some 300 objects from every turn of this close-packed career, it's been somewhat pruned - but none the worse for it - for its only American stop, at the National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street (through Nov. 3)."

That is not to suggest that the 36-year-old Dr. Seltzer is working on a new musical for Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, running for mayor of New York or planning a new venture in outer space. But like the poet-lyricist, the City Council President and the astronaut before her, Dr. Seltzer, an obstetrician and gynecologist, holds a Young Woman Achiever Award from the National Council of Women. ''Basically,'' said Dr. Seltzer, who received the award in June, not long before her birthday, ''it's for woman who have contributed to their professions and their community and have made significant contributions by the time they're 35.''"

      "lead_paragraph": "A recent issue of Le Point, a leading French news magazine, carried on its cover a full-page illustration for a story on ''Culture: How to Resist America.'' The bottom half of the illustration shows a besieged European continent with tiny figures of d'Artagnan and Don Quixote girded for battle, supported, more or less, by a Rhine Maiden, Arlequino, Michaelangelo's David, the Parthenon, and Shakespeare's Globe Theater. Above, high in the sky, all-conquering, invincible, flies a United States astronaut, festooned with electronic equipment and bearing on his winglike arms Mickey Mouse, E.T., a cowboy and Marilyn Monroe. In actual fact, d'Artagnan and Don Quixote are losing. A glance at recent issues of Variety, the entertainment industry's trade journal, gives the general picture. A scattered sampling indicates that American films dominate the market in Paris, London, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki and Oslo. American movies hold 52.5 percent of the domestic market in Italy. Other parts of the world? Sylvester Stallone's ''Rambo,'' is running neck and neck with a Cantonese comedy in Hong Kong. In Australia, the same ''Rambo'' seems to be fending off a vigorous challenge from ''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,'' by all accounts the most successful film in Australian history. But it is Bill Murray's recording-breaking ''Ghostbusters'' that leads the pack for the first half of 1985 in Tokyo, where four of the top five films are American."
