Koptev, director general of the Russian Space Agency, were on opposite sides of the cold war, creating space-age technology to keep the other at bay. Now they have become the odd couple of space planning. Flying around the globe, increasingly visible and assertive, they have successfully negotiated one political mine field after another to push their pet project -- an international outpost in space for astronauts of all nationalities. If successful, the $30 billion venture, to be completed by the year 2001, will be the biggest science collaboration of all time. In many regards the two men couldn't be more different. Mr. Goldin is trim, energetic, a drinker of Coca-Cola. The portly Mr. Koptev is philosophical and has a fondness for gin. Yet similarities far outweigh the differences. Both are 53 years old. Both have been married about 30 years. Both have two children. Before directing the sprawling civil space programs of their two Governments, both were cold warriors who led technical groups with deadly military aims. Mr. Goldin was a director of top-secret space projects at T.R.W. Inc., a defense contractor in California. Mr. Koptev was a high official in the Soviet Ministry of General Machine Building, which ran Moscow's military space program."
