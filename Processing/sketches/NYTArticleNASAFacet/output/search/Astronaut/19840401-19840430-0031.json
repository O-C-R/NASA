The Indian astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, a 35-year-old squadron leader in the Indian Air Force, is to join two Russian astronauts in the eight-day scientific mission. India is not likely to have its own manned space program for a long time, if ever, and Mr. Sharma's flight may well be the last by an Indian for a lorng time. Nevertheless, he is not merely going along for the rise, and he will be doing more than simply asserting national pride and identity when he practices his yoga."

PAMELA REED TACKLES 4 ROLES IN 'FEN' They are all in Caryl Churchill's ''Fen,'' which reopened recently at the Public Theater with American actors playing multiple roles, as did their British counterparts last year. Miss Reed, whose performance received critical praise, is a sadistic stepmother, a 9-year-old girl, a Baptist leader and a little boy scaring crows. With all the quick changes to be made, she says, ''Backstage is as good a show as up front.'' Three dressers help with costumes and brush the actors off after each exit, because they get covered with the peat moss that blankets the stage to suggest potato fields. ''It gets in your nose,'' she said. ''We all have black toenails.''"

Rakesh Sharma, a 35-year-old Indian Air Force pilot, joined the two Soviet astronauts for an eight-day visit to the Salyut 7 space station, where three other Soviet astronauts have been living since Feb. 8. The joint flight, the 11th in the ''intercosmos'' series that has taken non- Soviet astronauts into space along with Soviet astronauts, is to include medical experiments in which Mr. Sharma will practice yoga as a possible means of coping with space sickness. The experiments also include detailed space surveys of the Indian subcontinent. But Western experts expect that, like the 10 previous joint flights, this one will probably be less notable for scientific achievement than for claims of new levels of Soviet-Indian relations."

It will be the 11th flight of the space shuttles, and the Challenger's fifth. Thunderstorms and heavy rains lashed the launching base as technicians began work early this morning. But because they were mostly working indoors, checking flight systems by remote control, the storm caused no problems. The weather for launching morning is expected to be excellent."

The planned six-day mission, the first attempt to use the shuttle for servicing satellites, was launched on schedule at 8:58 A.M. After checking out the spaceship and finding that all aboard was well, the astronauts were set to handle their first task, the deployment of a 30-foot-long, 11-ton satellite carrying 57 experiments into the effects of the space environment on metals, electronics, other materials and tomato seeds. The satellite, the Long Duration Exposure Facility, is to be released into orbit Saturday morning. Then Capt. Robert L. Crippen of the Navy and Francis R. Scobee are to maneuver the Challenger higher and closer to their primary target, the Solar Max satellite that has been crippled for more than three years. They are to rendezvous with the satellite Sunday."

Ashley Boone, president of marketing at Columbia Pictures, estimates that approximately $400,000 apiece will have been spent on each of the movies nominated for best picture - ''The Big Chill,'' ''The Dresser,'' ''The Right Stuff,'' ''Tender Mercies,'' and ''Terms of Endearment'' - by the time the envelopes are torn open tomorrow night. Irving Ivers, vice-president of advertising at M-G-M/ UA, thinks that Academy Award campaigns for some movies may cost half a million dollars. What the studios get for their money is not simply the prestige of winning Academy Awards. An award as best picture of the year can mean as much as $30 million at the box office. The night after its victory as the best movie of 1981, ''Chariots of Fire'' sold 100 per cent more tickets than it had sold a week earlier. In the next three weeks, the inspirational movie about two British runners in the 1924 Olympic Games earned nearly $15 million. And approximately half of ''The Deer Hunter's'' $60 million in ticket sales came after it was anointed as the best movie of 1978."

It could be the dawn, too, of a new era of the human enterprise in space. Shortly after 10 A.M., with the rising sun to his back and the Challenger beginning the 33d orbit of its mission, an astronaut wearing a jet-propulsion backpack is scheduled to fly the 200 feet from the spaceship to Solar Max. The backpack was successfully checked in untethered flights by astronauts on the previous shuttle mission in February."

TOMORROW NIGHT, when the 56th annual Academy Awards are handed out, a man whose name is unknown to almost everybody in the television audience will be a prominent contender for three of the golden statues. In fact, Hollywood considers James L. Brooks, this season's hot new writer-director, a heavy favorite. Even if Brooks loses, he won't be, ever again, just an anonymous television producer. Rags to riches, anonymity to fame--turning beggers into millionaires and soda jerks into Super Bowl quarterbacks--is a staple of countless movie plots. Given the way things work in Hollywood, turning a successful writer-producer of television situation comedies into the writer, producer and director of a movie that has been nominated for 11 Oscars was infinitely more difficult."

But they planned to give it another try Monday or Tuesday morning in a determined effort to salvage the satellite - and the space shuttle's mission. Dr. George D. Nelson, hovering in space 200 feet from the shuttle, tried again and again to lock on to the crippled satellite and slow its spin. But as darkness approached and his fuel reserves dwindled, he was forced to abandon the bold mission and return to the ship. Satellite Becoming Stable Frank Cepollina, the manager of the Solar Max repair mission at the Goddard Space Center, said at a news conference late tonight that the satellite, which was left twisting and tumbling as a result of the retrieval effort, was responding to commands and was gradually settling down to a smoother flight."

The one thing ninth graders at Great Neck South High School have in common is that they are little. As a ninth grader, Scott Currie felt too small to offer opinions. If he had a wild urge, he would go to the school library, put on his headphones and quietly listen to punk rock. His hero was an upperclassman named Lyle who slept in school by day and by night played drums for a punk band in Greenwich Village. Tenth grade is no picnic either. Eric Gordon was completely isolated his sophomore year. ''I felt inadequate socially, I just didn't fit in,'' he said. ''I had a bleak outlook.'' He took contentious stands - announcing, for instance, that poetry was stupid. When his class studied ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' he was shocked to find he was exactly like Holden Caulfield. It happens to 10th graders all the time, his English teacher, Marcia Weinberg, says. Without fail, several 10th graders will tell her privately that they are cracking up, just like Holden. This year, after lecturing on Dostoyevsky and Camus, Mrs. Weinberg also discovered she had a Raskolnikov and a Stranger in class."

Paramount's ''Terms of Endearment'' collected five awards - best picture, director, screenplay, Shirley MacLaine as best actress and Jack Nicholson as best supporting actor - in the 56th annual ceremonies at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center. James L. Brooks - the producer, director and screenwriter of ''Terms of Endearment'' - went home with three of the golden Oscars. On his first trip to the stage, to receive an award for best screenplay adapted from another source, Mr. Brooks, who is best known as the creator of such television situation comedies as ''Taxi'' and ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' thanked the author of ''Terms of Endearment,'' Larry McMurtry, for ''a wonderful book.'' When he came back a second time, for his award as best director, he seemed almost in tears and could only say, ''I'm overwhelmed.'' It took Mr. Brooks, who had never directed a movie before, four years to get a studio to make ''Terms of Endearment.'' Duvall Wins Best Actor Holding his Oscar for best picture, he said that even though Hollywood studios had turned ''Terms of Endearment'' down, it was ''more significant that a Hollywood studio made the movie.''"

''The gut shuts down, it just stops functioning,'' he told 175 people at a University of North Carolina Medical School alumni luncheon on Saturday. ''That's why they were experiencing vomiting without nausea. The stomach would fill with gastric juices, but they weren't going anywhere. There would be a cold sweat, sudden vomiting and they would get flushed.''"

Encouraged by the success of ground controllers in stabilizing the twisting, tossing satellite, bringing it to a slow roll, the astronauts are set to maneuver the Challenger to within 30 feet of Solar Max and attempt to retrieve it with a grappling device at the end of the shuttle's mechanical arm. This operation was scheduled to begin shortly after 8 A.M. Eastern standard time. The 5,000-pound Solar Max eluded capture Sunday when a grasping tool carried by a spacewalking astronaut malfunctioned. His bumping efforts sent Solar Max into such an erratic tumble that it reduced to a slim hope any prospect of a successful retrieval. Four subsequent attempts to snare the satellite with the shuttle's 50-foot mechanical arm proved fruitless."

The repairs are expected to require six hours, starting about 4:30 A.M., with the astronauts taking turns doing the delicate work. Dr. George D. Nelson and Dr. James D. van Hoften say practice has shown them the delicate work required for the repairs constantly forces the gloves of their pressurized spacesuit against their fingertips. After the job is done their fingernails will be ''black and blue.''"

The mission had been plucked from the brink of failure after earlier frustrations. Terry J. Hart, the astronaut operating the 50-foot-long mechanical arm, grabbed the slowly rolling and wobbling satellite on the first try, locking on to a protruding knob the size of a fist. Then he hauled the 5,000-pound satellite into the shuttle's cargo bay, easing it into a cradle back near the tail section."

They made it look easy, which was encouraging to planners of future space missions requiring the shuttles to make service calls on satellites for refueling, maintenance and even construction tasks. Working outside in the Challenger's cargo bay, where the 5,000-pound Solar Max was berthed, Dr. George D. Nelson and Dr. James D. van Hoften used power tools designed for weightless conditions to replace two large modules and fix a scientific instrument 305 miles above the earth. Plan to Release Satellite This restored the satellite to operational health for the first time in three years and perhaps added years to its useful lifetime. After hours of checking out Solar Max's condition, engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said the overhauled satellite should be ready for redeployment in its own orbit Thursday morning. It was set to be released by the same mechanical arm that snared it and brought it aboard Tuesday."

      "lead_paragraph": "THERE can be little doubt now about Malcolm Morley's importance. As much as any painter of his generation, he has been following the path of the most resistance. During the last few years, his canvases have been rings in which he, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Conceptual Art and assorted modernist heavyweights have been hammering away at one another. Morley has helped preserve the urgency of one of the Abstract Expressionist questions: How is it possible for an artist to enlist in the just wars of 20th-century art and still produce painting of conviction and ambition? One of the problems with Morley's past work was that the conflicting forces in it could hammer away at one another to the point where paintings seemed slightly punchdrunk. A work that might at first seem wild, effusive and instinctive could wind up too stunned by the blow of Conceptual Art to be able to find its own corner. A painting that seemed an expression of Morley's robust sensuality could wind up almost bleak in its self-denial and abnegation. While Morley's method became increasingly influential, some work that resulted from that method seemed not so much generative as self-destructive and perverse."

With Solar Max, the orbiting solar observatory, at first the toil spelled only trouble. Over the weekend, a free-flying astronaut failed to capture the malfunctioning satellite, making matters worse when he sent it into an end-over-end tumble. Ground controllers were able to stabilize the craft, however, after which the astronauts stretched out the shuttle's mechanical arm and brought Solar Max into the cargo bay for the first major in-orbit repair job."

The seven town councilmen, five of whom are French Canadians, voted overwhelmingly early this month to ignore the order to remove the English words and to fight any fine in the courts. Their decision represents the newest serious challenge to Quebec's Charter of the French Language, a measure whose authority was somewhat eroded last week by a court ruling that allowed storekeepers to offer bilingual catalogues rather than the French-only brochures that the provincial government asserted were required by the charter."

White House officials say the President's six-day visit will include talks on a range of topics aimed at easing tensions that have arisen in America's relations with China over the last two years. Officials also say the results of the trip are likely to be a centerpiece of Mr. Reagan's re-election bid. For the first time, Mr. Reagan will be visiting a country that is not a staunch ally; China will be the second Communist country he has ever visited, after East Germany, where he journeyed in 1978. Wide Range of Issues Much of the news coverage is likely to focus on Mr. Reagan's visits to the sites of Peking, Shanghai and the ancient burial pits of Xian. But Administration officials say the chief significance of the President's trip will lie in how much understanding is achieved in discussions with the Chinese leaders on such issues as relations with the Soviet Union and Taiwan, trade, American investment in China and other matters."

Mondale have mounted sharp attacks on each other and on the Reagan Administration in their campaigns leading to the Texas Democratic caucuses May 5, but the real battle is being waged with quiet fervor in the precincts. There are 6,634 precincts across this vast and varied state - ''politically Balkanized'' as one Hart worker put it - and to win any of the 200 national convention delegates ultimately at stake here, the Presidential candidates and their organizations must turn out supporters not once but twice. By the rules of the state's decades- old system, voters must get their names on the voter rolls by voting in the Democratic primary to nominate candidates for offices from county sheriff to the United States Senate. Then, 15 minutes after the polls close at 7 P.M., they must come back to the same precinct to take part in the Presidential caucus."
