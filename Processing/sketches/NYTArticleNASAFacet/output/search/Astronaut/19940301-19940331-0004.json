The flight will have no dramatic highlights -- no spacewalks, no satellite captures or repairs. And unlike the last mission, this one has no Russian guest on board. Rather, the 61st mission of the shuttle program is an exercise in hard science featuring five Americans and a dozen rats."

(\"Now there was no doubt,\" he wrote. \"Greg was going to be one stoned Brady.\") Mr. Williams said in a recent interview that the book \"was a turning point in my acceptance of the past,\" which is undoubtedly very true. But for Harper Perennial, the publisher, \"Growing Up Brady,\" which was written with Chris Kreski, was a cash cow that sold 250,000 copies and spent 15 weeks on the New York Times paperback nonfiction best-seller list. And its experience emboldened other publishers, who, being publishers, decided it was time to jump as nimbly as they could onto what they hoped would be a long and happy bandwagon."

It is the first of many images of a society in which everyone has gone a little batty and crime is so rampant that a knock on the door is as likely to signal an armed robbery as a neighborly visit. The film, which opens today at the Quad Cinema, focuses on the tumultuous domestic life of three eccentric women who share an apartment in an unnamed port city. Gertrudes (Norma Bengell), a strait-laced widow and piano teacher of 60, fancies herself a surrogate mother for her two troublesome boarders. Sensual, defiantly free-spirited Madalena (Maria Zilda Bethlem), who works as a nurse in a mental hospital, enjoys embarrassing the prudish Gertrudes by parading bare-breasted in front of the window. At night, she prowls the local cafes, picking up men and having quick, wild sex in odd places."
