But in a twist of fortunes even more marked than that in the Presidential race, Republican Senate candidates have made steady gains in the last 10 days, producing tight races in 11 of the 34 seats contested on Nov. 3. They have advanced most markedly in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Washington and Wisconsin, all states where Republicans were seen as sure losers only a few weeks ago."

Compared to the 1988 Presidential campaign, which gave us such memorable images as Willie Horton, Boston Harbor oozing slime and Michael Dukakis driving a tank, the 1992 race has been something of a disappointment. To be sure, the Bush campaign this weekend is running a commercial that depicts Arkansas as a spooky wasteland, like a scene out of \"Pet Sematary.\" But the old trick of making the opponent's state look like the underworld isn't going to win any prizes for originality."

With nearly two-thirds of the vote counted, Ms. Braun, a former State Senator, had won 56 percent of the vote, with the remainder going to the Republican, Rich Williamson. Surveys of voters leaving polls showed that Ms. Braun had scored particularly well among women, but won among men by only two points.

The scientists, writing in today's issue of the journal Nature, said the experiments showed that in many cases the virtual absence of gravity can affect the growth of biological crystals, sometimes altering their size, quality and structure. But they said the tests had \"not yet accomplished any significant breakthrough in protein-crystal growth\" and so far had failed to demonstrate that this was \"a wise way to spend ever more scarce government research dollars.\""
