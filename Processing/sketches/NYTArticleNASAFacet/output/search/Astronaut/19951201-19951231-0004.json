But flying into space is safer nowadays, and increasingly it is fueled by international diplomacy or cash or a little of both. Like much else in the waning days of the 20th century, space travel is threatening to turn from a calling into a currency. The political side of the coin was highlighted last week as President Clinton announced a plan for Israeli astronauts to fly aboard the space shuttle and the planned international space station."
