Schirra Jr., one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts and the only astronaut to fly in all three of NASA's earliest manned space programs -- Mercury, Gemini and Apollo -- died yesterday in San Diego.

His death, at a hospital in La Jolla, was caused by a heart attack, said Ruth Chandler Varonfakis, a family friend and spokeswoman for the San Diego Air and Space Museum. Captain Schirra, a Navy combat pilot in the Korean War and later a test pilot, became the fifth American in space and the third American to orbit the earth when he lifted off from Cape Canaveral in the Sigma 7 Mercury craft in October 1962."

      "lead_paragraph": "THE Tel Aviv-born Keren Ann Zeidel is a singer-songwriter who infuses her spare, poetic lyrics with subtle, complex and sometimes lush compositions. Her self-titled ''Keren Ann'' (Metro Blue) comes out Tuesday, her third album to be released in the United States. Raised in Paris, Ms. Zeidel, 33, speaks Hebrew, French, English and Dutch. While on tour in Europe (she moves on to the United States beginning next month), Ms. Zeidel spoke late at night with Winter Miller by phone as her bus rolled along the French countryside toward Brest in Brittany. ''We wake up in a different town every day, sometimes in a different country,'' she said. Here is what she's listening to and why. Dayna Kurtz She's a wonderful poet and songwriter from Brooklyn. I've seen her onstage; she's an outstanding musician. I met her in Hoboken, and I was blown away by her vocals and how she plays any instrument she touches. She has a very soulful way of singing and plays mostly guitar and banjo. Her writing is very honest; every moment feels lived and felt. Even when she writes fiction. Many of the storytellers or songwriters that I listen to are men from the '70s, and Dayna Kurtz is one of the female singer-songwriters I find to be totally original. It's very feminine writing. I recognize her way of seeing things and telling stories, it's the eyes of a woman. Her voice is uniquely textured; she can sing very low or she can go really high. I particularly love ''Venezuela'' from ''Another Black Feather'' (Kismet). She sings, ''Venezuela looked like Brooklyn, only the streets were twice as wide.'' The melody brings the whole picture to your eyes. Philip Glass ''Best of Philip Glass'' (an import from Sony) is some of his more accessible stuff. Hopefully you'll go crazy for him and listen to it all. He is a giant. I don't think any rock band or songwriter brings the kind of innovation to the contemporary music landscape that he does. He created emotion in repetition. What Sigur Ros does is called repetitive music, but Philip Glass created it. I know the songs on this record from their original recordings, but it's important to know Philip Glass and his oeuvre. Joseph Arthur He's one hell of a songwriter. He always has great ambience and sound environments on his records. ''Let's Just Be'' (Lonely Astronaut) is like a ride, a very deep one. He's doing something instinctive that's unlike anything that exists. The best thing when you're a songwriter is to have your own style that doesn't resemble anyone or anything, and he has that. You hear in his music that he's inspired by all he's listened to, but his writing is all his own. He's not scared of romantic or honest lyrics. This album has children's choirs and tons of guitars and loops, and he's recorded his vocals with different frequencies. Put on the first song and it will take you through the record. It's a ride and it's a good one. Great Lake Swimmers ''Ongiara'' (Misra) has a wonderful atmosphere. My favorite track on the album is ''Passenger Song.'' I'm so bored with singer-songwriters who don't have any production values. If you're not writing like Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, don't try to be so simple. This is minimalist but well done. The recording is good, and the voices sound really beautiful. The record feels light and airy. You can hear every word, every syllable, and the melodies are just right. As I listened to it, it seemed as if it came to me like air, like breathing. Justin Timberlake He's a great artist. ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' (Jive) is fantastic, amazingly well produced and innovative. His songs have a good vibe, and they sound fun. I'm not looking at the writing in terms of a singer-songwriter. I like the texture of the sound in the production: the beats, the programming of the keyboards. I'm always very impressed by certain productions that are very far from the way I produce and far from my music, probably because they are a mystery to me. He's a great performer and a great recording artist. My niece has a crush on him. Third World Love This band is killer. The songs on ''Sketch of Tel Aviv'' (Smalls) are timeless. These guys are all jazz musicians, but you don't have to be a jazz fan to like this record. (If you are, you'll be blown away.) It's melodic, with a rock spirit to it. It's playful; they play with each other, like dialogue through music. The trumpet player Avishai Cohen has his own solo career, and they all have different setups. I think that every term that scares some people away from listening to jazz could actually be a complimentary adjective to this record. This album is funky and jazzy. I like to hear it in the car or to start the day. You can listen to it like you'd watch a movie, with your full attention. They bring the sound and the visual to it."

      "lead_paragraph": "Aspen Isn't Laughing The United States Comedy Arts Festival, the biggest event of its kind in the country, is leaving Aspen, Colo., after 13 years, The Denver Post reported on Friday. A spokeswoman for HBO, the event's sponsor, said the festival would not be in Aspen in 2008, citing costs and the dwindling number of hotel rooms. Since 1995, the comedy festival, held in February and March, brought Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Martin, Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal, Larry David and others to that mountain resort town. ''Space is limited, and it's incredibly expensive,'' an HBO spokeswoman said of Aspen. ''Many of the properties also require four- or five-day stays, which is difficult, and expensive too.'' There were unconfirmed reports that HBO would move the festival to Santa Barbara, Calif., but the HBO spokeswoman said only that Santa Barbara was one of several possibilities. Rebirth in Lebanon The Italian conductor Riccardo Muti, below, will begin a season of summer festivals in Lebanon that were canceled last year because of the war between Israel and Hezbollah, Middle East Online has reported. Mr. Muti will conduct an orchestra at the Roman temples of Baalbek and play the piano at the Beiteddine Festival near Beirut. The Lebanese tourism minister, Joseph Sarkis, said that all four of his country's major annual art festivals would be revived this summer, despite the country's continuing political crisis. They take place in Baalbek, Beiteddine, Byblos and Tyre. Coppola's Comeback Francis Ford Coppola's ''Youth Without Youth,'' the first film he has directed since 1997, will have its world premiere at the RomeFilmFest in October, Variety reported. The film, produced, adapted and directed by Mr. Coppola, left, is based on a 1976 novel by the Romanian-born writer and scholar Mircea Eliade. It stars Tim Roth as a 70-year-old Romanian who attracts the interest of the Nazis after he is struck by lightning and apparently given immortality. The film was shot in Romania and will be released in the United States in December. Radio Drama The 92nd Street Y Unterberg Poetry Center will stage the American premiere on Monday night of two radio plays by the Irish short-story writer William Trevor. ''Going Home'' and ''Mr. McNamara,'' based on stories that Mr. Trevor wrote in 1972 and 1976, are directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, the producing director of the Irish Repertory Theater in New York. Search for Missing Ashes The search for a rocket carrying ashes of the actor James Doohan, who played Scotty the engineer on ''Star Trek,'' continues almost two weeks after it was launched in New Mexico, Reuters reported. A rocket carrying remains of the actor, who died two years ago at 85; the ashes of the astronaut L. Gordon Cooper Jr.; and several experiments blasted off on April 28. A spokeswoman for the Houston-based Space Services Inc. said the rocket had descended into a rugged area of New Mexico that a search team had been unable to reach. Gibson's Rehabilitation A California judge praised Mel Gibson, below, on Friday for his rehabilitation after his arrest for drunken driving last year, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Gibson, the actor and director, was arrested for driving under the influence in Malibu, after which he subjected the arresting officers to an expletive-laden, anti-Semitic rant. Mr. Gibson, 51, who later apologized for his remarks, was sentenced to three years' probation, fined $1,300, and ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings five days a week for four and a half months, then three times a week for seven and a half months. At a hearing in Malibu to assess his progress, Judge Lawrence Mira said he was impressed with Mr. Gibson's commitment. ''I truly believe the rehabilitation that is being effected in this case is effective, and I don't want to do anything to interrupt that,'' he said, in explaining why Mr. Gibson was not asked to appear for the hearing. Mr. Gibson must appear at an Aug. 23 hearing for a final progress report, Judge Mira ruled. No China Tour for the Met The Metropolitan Opera has scrapped plans for what would have been its first tour of China, citing the logistical challenges of performing Tan Dun's ''First Emperor'' there with the tenor Plácido Domingo in 2008."

      "lead_paragraph": "For years, China has chafed at efforts by the United States to exclude it from full membership in the world's elite space club. So lately China seems to have hit on a solution: create a new club. Beijing is trying to position itself as a space benefactor to the developing world -- the same countries, in some cases, whose natural resources China covets here on earth. The latest and most prominent example came last week when China launched a communications satellite for Nigeria, a major oil producer, in a project that serves as a tidy case study of how space has become another arena where China is trying to exert its soft power."
