Declaring her faith in the benefits of aerospace research, Countess ALBINA DU BOISROUVRAY told the World Space Congress at the Washington Convention Center that she had established a $250,000 Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Aerospace Prize \"to encourage the advancement\" of related sciences. The prize, to be awarded every two years, is named for the Countess's son, a pilot who had dreamed of becoming an astronaut but who died in a helicopter crash in Mali in 1986, at the age of 24. The first prize is scheduled to be awarded in the fall of 1993."
