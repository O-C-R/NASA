But lately, motorcycle riding has lost some of its carefree personality, even in California, the setting for the events that inspired ''The Wild One,'' for Steve McQueen's off-road adventures and for much of the restless spirit of motorcycle culture. Motorcycle sales in the state have jumped about 40 percent since 2001, spurred partly by drivers seeking relief from rising fuel costs and congested freeways. All those newbie riders -- many of them revving a new generation of more powerful bikes -- combined with more challenging road conditions have contributed to a significant rise in accidents. Easy Rider isn't sitting so easy anymore."
