He tested a steering wheel designed by middle schoolers to detect distracted driving and peeked inside a robot that plays soccer. It was meant as an inspirational moment: children, science is fun; work harder. Politicians and educators have been wringing their hands for years over test scores showing American students falling behind their counterparts in Slovenia and Singapore. How will the United States stack up against global rivals in innovation? The president and industry groups have called on colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year and 100,000 new teachers with majors in STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math. All the Sputnik-like urgency has put classrooms from kindergarten through 12th grade -- the pipeline, as they call it -- under a microscope. And there are encouraging signs, with surveys showing the number of college freshmen interested in majoring in a STEM field on the rise."

They also present excerpts, not shown publically before, from hours of video footage taken during her rehabilitation. ''Gabrielle Giffords is too tough to let this beat her,'' Mr. Kelly says. The couple's book, ''Gabby: A Story of Hope and Courage,'' will be released on Tuesday. 5:05 A.M. (Flix) THE 400 BLOWS (1959) The director François Truffaut, in his feature-film debut, a defining entry in French New Wave cinema, drew inspiration from his childhood for a story about a 12-year-old who escapes his dysfunctional family by turning to crime. ''Words cannot state simply how fine is Jean-Pierre Léaud,'' in the lead role, Bosley Crowther wrote in his review in The New York Times. ''Out of this brand-new youngster, M. Truffaut has elicited a performance that will live as a delightful, provoking and heartbreaking monument to a boy.'' He added, ''Here is a picture that encourages an exciting refreshment of faith in films.''"
