Sequestered for an interview in a private chamber at a posh hotel in downtown Manhattan, Simon LeBon motions for an assistant to come over. Pointing to his sparkling water, he says, with practiced derision: ''They made the ice with tap water -- I can taste the chlorine in it. Can you bring me another?'' Pause. ''With no ice?'' Moments later, the offending glass is replaced. Order, if it had ever been lost, is restored. There days, it's all coming back to him, along with the other members of Duran Duran, the band that once made them the crush objects of seemingly every adolescent girl on the planet. The group was one of the first success stories of the MTV era, five comely British lads with penchants for supermodel girlfriends, aggressive fashion and bombastic, synth-happy rock that wasn't afraid of disco sensuality. For three years, they topped American and British charts with indelibly catchy songs -- ''Rio,'' ''Hungry Like the Wolf'' and ''The Reflex'' -- puffy with lyrical ambiguity. Their second and third albums, ''Rio'' and ''Seven and the Ragged Tiger,'' went platinum within weeks of release and contained their biggest hits. Then, just as quickly as the band appeared, it dissolved. Various permutations of group members, some recording under the original name, would chart through the next decade, but they would never register as highly as the original crew."

      "lead_paragraph": "A Post-Nobel Roller Coaster Before the Austrian novelist ELFRIEDE JELINEK, right, won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday, her books were not exactly blockbusters. One of her best known works in English translation, ''The Piano Teacher'' -- a novel of lust and domination written in the biting style that, in the Swedish Academy's description, reveals ''the absurdity of society's clichés and their subjugating power'' -- was No. 1,163,804 on Amazon.com's sales rankings early Thursday, according to The Associated Press. By Friday, it had climbed to No. 9, one of four of Ms. Jelinek's works to reach the top 70. (By yesterday, however, her books had slipped a little; ''The Piano Teacher'' was No. 17 and two other titles, ''Wonderful, Wonderful Times'' and ''Women as Lovers,'' had fallen into the triple digits.) Demand has been so high for some of the books that the American distributor for Ms. Jelinek's work is sold out of its stock, and new copies will not arrive for three to four weeks. ''You don't keep a large quantity of books around when they're not moving,'' said SUSAN DOERR, the marketing director for the distributor, Consortium. 'Twas the Night Before... MICHAEL MOORE and the distributors of his documentary ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' are in talks to bring the film to pay-per-view television the night before the presidential election. The film would be part of a three-hour program to be broadcast on Nov. 1, which would also feature interviews with politically minded celebrities, according to reports from Reuters and Variety. Carried by In Demand Networks, the program, ''The Michael Moore Pre-Election Special,'' would begin at 8 p.m. Eastern Time the night before the election and cost $9.95. The DVD and VHS versions of Mr. Moore's film together sold about 2 million copies on Tuesday, the first day of their release, according to Sony. Pop: Albums in Release Fall is a big season for the music industry, a time when record labels look for major hits that will carry them for the rest of the year. Among the notable recordings -- and potential hits -- to be released tomorrow are ''Astronaut'' (Epic), the latest comeback vehicle for the 1980's pop group Duran Duran, led by SIMON LE BON, left, and its first album since the 80's to feature all the original members; ''The New Danger'' (Geffen), the first CD in five years by MOS DEF, the rapper and actor who was nominated for an Emmy Award this year; CELINE DION's ''Miracle'' (Epic); a solo album by FRANK BLACK, the Pixies' leader, ''Frank Black Francis'' (SpinART), a two-CD set featuring new and old versions of Pixies songs; the smart-alecky punk-pop group Sum 41's fourth album, ''Chuck'' (Island); and a small pile of Christmas albums (yes, leaves are barely turning, yet it's time for Christmas albums) by LEANN RIMES, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, BIG BAD VOODOO DADDY, CHRIS ISAAK and VANESSA WILLIAMS. Uploaders, Beware Following the aggressive legal campaign of American record companies, the British Phonographic Industry (B.P.I.), the trade group that represents record labels in Britain, will begin to issue lawsuits to Internet users it says are illegally trading music. The B.P.I. announced late last week that it would sue 28 Internet users who were identified as ''major uploaders'' -- that is, those who make music available for others to download -- the BBC reported. The B.P.I. began its campaign in March by warning 350,000 users that they were illegally trading music. The B.P.I. does not yet know the names of the the users that it will target, but it is asking the British courts to force the users' Internet service providers to release their personal information. 'Shark Tale' No. 1 The animated comedy ''Shark Tale'' remained the top dog at the box office, taking in $31.7 million to hold the No. 1 spot for the second straight weekend, The Associated Press reported. ''Friday Night Lights,'' directed by PETER BERG and starring BILLY BOB THORNTON, took second place with $20.6 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. The film is based on the real-life fervor for high school football in Odessa, Texas. ''Shark Tale'' held up especially well, its haul down just 33 percent from opening weekend. The movie lifted its 10-day total to $87.7 million. ''Ladder 49'' was third with $13.3 million, and the QUEEN LATIFAH and JIMMY FALLON action comedy ''Taxi'' had a mediocre opening weekend of $12.05 million to place fourth. The weekend's other new wide release, ''Raise Your Voice'' with HILARY DUFF, opened No. 6 with $4.6 million. Footnotes TOMMY LEE, the bad-boy drummer for Mötley Crüe, will try out for the marching band at the University of Nebraska today. Mr. Lee is at the school for a reality television show in which he will live the life of an undergraduate, taking classes in chemistry, literature and the history of rock 'n' roll, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Lee, a high school dropout, told The Lincoln Journal Star that he was looking forward to ''a little music, some education, some partying -- the whole college experience.'' The school said it hopes the show will be a way for potential students to learn about college life, but faculty is bracing for the worst. ''I hope that turns out to be the right judgment,'' Chancellor Harvey Perlman wrote to faculty in an e-mail message last week. ''I am tempted to say something like, 'If it doesn't work you can vote me off the island,' but I've already used that line. All I can say is join me in keeping your fingers crossed.''

Burdened -- tainted -- with intimate knowledge of the D train, I could never grow up into that ideal of disinterested equanimity all Miss Americas should embody. But so what? I could become Miss Subways."

''Evidence,'' first exhibited with much controversy in San Francisco in 1977, consists of 89 anonymous black-and-white photographs and a lone color picture selected from government and institutional archives by the artists Larry Sultan and Mike Mandel. Among these mysterious documentary images is a man with a fireproof plastic bag on his head (reminding you freakishly of the hooded figure in one of the photographs from Abu Ghraib) and another of someone doing push-ups on a carpeted floor in an astronaut suit. What could they mean? This is a difficult question, for there are no image captions. All we are told is that the artists spent two years searching for images in the files and archives of more than 100 government agencies, educational institutions and corporations ranging from the Highway Users Federation and Asphalt Institute to the Beverly Hills Police Department. Now a classic of conceptual photography, ''Evidence'' is being toured nationally by the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson, the archive to which the artists donated the prints."
