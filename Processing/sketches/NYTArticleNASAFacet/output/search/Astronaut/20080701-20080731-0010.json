Mrs. Roosevelt became an honorary member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, a historically black organization founded in 1908, and the group announced this week at its centennial convention that Mrs. Obama had agreed to join. The sorority said that once Mrs. Obama was formally inducted into the organization, which has 225,000 members, she could not become a member of any of the other ''Divine Nine'' organizations, as black sororities and fraternities are often called. Other honorary members of Alpha Kappa Alpha include the poet Maya Angelou, the late Coretta Scott King and the former astronaut Mae Jemison."
