After playing pivotal supporting roles in two Tom Hanks hits, \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Apollo 13,\" and winning an Academy Award nomination for his performance in \"Forrest Gump,\" he moved on to \"Truman,\" incarnating the President in the HBO movie based on his life. Now, with Hollywood stardom very much in his trajectory, Mr. Sinise has taken a characteristic 90-degree turn. He has returned, for the present, to his alternate career as a director in the theater, working with Sam Shepard on a partly revised version of the playwright's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Buried Child.\" The production, which stars James Gammon, Lois Smith and Ethan Hawke, recently opened the season at the Steppenwolf Theater Company, the celebrated troupe that Mr. Sinise and two friends founded 20 years ago."

Low clouds and light rain at the Kennedy Space Center cleared long enough for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to launch its sixth shuttle mission of the year."

Overhead, seemingly skimming the roof of the tiny seventh-floor apartment, a Cathay Pacific 747 screamed past, banking amid apartment blocks toward Hong Kong's airport at Kai Tak. And then another, and another, every two or three minutes. By mid-1998 those jets will be stilled. Kai Tak is Asia's third-busiest airport, hunkered down in the heart of the city -- the Kwoks and more than 350,000 people live in its landing path -- and stretched far beyond its capacity. So Hong Kong, like many fast-growing Asian cities, is building a new one -- and in the process giving a resounding vote of confidence in Hong Kong's future."
