Ms. Nowak is charged with attacking Colleen Shipman in a Florida airport parking lot two years ago. Ms. Shipman had begun dating Ms. Nowak's love interest, Bill Oefelein, a former space shuttle pilot. A judge in Orlando ruled that Ms. Nowak's lawyers could depose Ms. Shipman for a second time to determine if she was actually touched by pepper spray during the confrontation. Ms. Nowak's lawyers have a report from emergency technicians that raises questions about whether Ms. Shipman was sprayed. The issue is important because Ms. Nowak's lawyers want one of her criminal charges thrown out if Ms. Shipman was not harmed by the spray. Ms. Nowak, above, was not in court for the hearing."

But as Jenny Allen delivers it again and again, with a variety of inflections, this most customary of compliments starts to sound like fightin' words. In ''I Got Sick Then I Got Better,'' her embraceable one-woman show about having a life-threatening cancer, Ms. Allen speaks with passion and precision about the forms of being told how well she looked when she was undergoing chemotherapy. Her analyses should be collected into a special book of grammar."
