Pressed to reveal her source of the unfamiliar word, Rosett would say only, ''I borrowed it from an old family friend, who when she couldn't remember the name for something, would call it a whichamahoosy.'' I touched database with Google and can offer only one previous citation of that particular mouth-filler: a February 2002 use by a blogger who styles himself LoneRanger. It is related, I suspect, to hoosydingy, a word I have long used as a nonsense substitute when a specific term has slipped my mind. But even though I have tried all the variant spellings, I cannot find hoosydingy -- hoosiedinghy? -- in print anywhere. Closest use was by Kevin Paul Dupont in The Boston Globe early last year reporting about a hockey player's ''receiving off-site physical therapy for his aching whatchamacallit or whodingy.''"

First of all, a phrase like ''race in contemporary art'' almost always means that the race in question is nonwhite. As the show's curator, the art historian Maurice Berger writes in his introduction to this show, at the International Center of Photography: ''In mainstream American society and culture, whiteness remains an ever-present state of mind and body, a powerful norm so pervasive that it is rarely acknowledged or even named.'' In the 1990's, this awareness gave rise to an academic field called whiteness studies. The subject extends from history to culture, but the visual arts in particular seem ripe for analytic pickings. Now that the world is overpopulated by images, we have started to examine just how they shape our most basic modes of thought and feeling."

Arthur Mitchell, the artistic director, above, explains his vision: ''WHAT is the first art form? I say dance, because before the child is born, it kicks, and kicking is movement. It is how children express themselves. We use this idea in our after-school programs and in our work with public schoolteachers. We teach them how to use the arts and dance in teaching their subjects -- when you do a pass√©, what's that? That's a triangle! If you stand on one leg, take the other foot, bring it across your knee, that's a four! Newton? Who's Newton? Many of these children have never seen an apple tree. To explain gravity, I tell them to jump. You have to make things relevant."
