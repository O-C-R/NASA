      "lead_paragraph": "''Outlaw'' is not a term that obviously applies to Natalie Merchant. This 36-year-old singer is no gender-bending blasphemer; most parents probably feel blessed when her soothing alto emanates from their children's bedrooms. Yet from the moment she emerged shrouded in a hot-pink veil to begin the second of five concerts at the Neil Simon Theater on Wednesday, Ms. Merchant gave her own definition to defiant artistry. ''People downcast in despair see the disillusion everywhere,'' she intoned in ''Break Your Heart.'' Ms. Merchant has made it her mission to witness and try to change that predicament. Idealism and ultra-sensitivity are her extremes; her opulent music, grounded in her own piano playing, sets the mood for her dramatically empathetic world view. Most of the songs she performed, ranging from her years in the band 10,000 Maniacs to the present, offered compassion or advice."
