Before the convention ended Wednesday, Mr. Guy, the bar association's director of meetings, supervised more than 1,200 events: speeches and panel discussions, prayer breakfasts, luncheon meetings and dinner dances, golf tournaments and tours of antebellum Atlanta. He and his staff made nearly 600,000 ''impressions,'' such as photocopies, signs, tickets, in their own print shop, shipped from the bar group's Chicago headquarters in trailers. The trucks imported some 59 tons of materials, most of it paper. ''The printed document,'' he explained, ''is very important to lawyers.''"

The tribute, which exuded sentiment without melancholy, was the inspiration of Danny Carroll, who plays the choreographer in the show.

And thanks to the German- American Tricentennial Commission the event is not about to go unnoticed. The commission's goal is to encourage and coordinate the many activities and observances taking place throughout the country this year. It was established by President Reagan, who has also designated 1983 as the Tricentennial Anniversary Year of German Settlement in America. Commission members include Warren E. Burger, Chief Justice of the United States, and Charles Z. Wick, director of the United States Information Agency."

In Iowa Saturday, where the word ''survivability'' is in the vocabulary of both farmers and arms control activists, a ''peace forum'' in the Des Moines Civic Center drew out some of the differences, some subtle and some not, between the four candidates who participated: former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and Senators John Glenn of Ohio, Alan Cranston of California and Gary Hart of Colorado. All four attacked President Reagan's arms control policies and endorsed a nuclear freeze, less military spending and the scrapping of some major new weapons systems, including the MX intercontinental missile. However, by the end of the two-and- a-half-hour question-and-answer session enough differences, mostly in tone and emphasis, had emerged to set Senator Glenn apart from the rest of the field and placed him about where his political strategists want him to be: committed to arms control reductions but more pro-military than the three other candidates on the panel."

He left his strategists to ponder the rougher work of his undeclared campaign, made clear in the previous rather exhaustive four days on the road."

He also fretted about relations with fellow crewmen, about separation from his family and about the increasing tedium of the 3,300-orbit mission, and worried about what officials on the ground thought of his work. The diary also contained some mild grumbling about the quality of processed foods aboard the spacecraft, the Salyut 7 orbital laboratory."

Andropov's latest arms control statement, a senior Administration official said, because it did not show any flexibility on two of the key issues delaying progress in negotiations on limiting medium-range missiles in Europe. The official said the Soviet leader's statement ignored two basic problems: Mr. Andropov's insistence that no new American missiles should be deployed by the Western alliance, and the renewed American insistence that any agreement on limits on the Soviet SS-20 mobile missile system be applied to Asia as well as Europe.

Officials of the Kennedy Space Center said preparations were proceeding smoothly toward a scheduled liftoff Tuesday at 2:15 A.M., New York time. Commanding the planned six-day mission, the eighth in the shuttle program and third for the Challenger, will be Capt. Richard H. Truly of the Navy, who was a pilot on the second test flight of the Columbia in 1981. The other crew members will be going into space for the first time. They are Comdr. Daniel C. Brandenstein of the Navy, Lieut. Comdr. Dale A. Gardner of the Navy, Lieut. Col. Guion S. Bluford Jr. of the Air Force and Dr. William E. Thornton, a physician."

When Guion S. Bluford Jr., a crew member, gives the order, the tension is likely to rise considerably here and at a modern new spacecraft control center at Hassan, a few miles west of here in the Deccan Highlands of southern India. For Insat 1-B is absolutely critical to India's fledgling efforts to apply space science and technology to its very down-to-earth problems. And when the astronaut triggers the flow of numbers to the consoles at Hassan that will tell the state of Insat's health, it will signal the beginning of the end of India's experimental period in space and the start of its operational period. Insat 1-B, says Prof. U. R. Rao, the Indian space research organization's director, ''heralds the dawn of the communications satellite era in India.''"

Despite intermittent problems with antennas and ground equipment, the preliminary tests of the improved communications link with the shuttle were described by flight controllers as ''very successful.'' After a sleep period that began at midafternoon, Houston time, the astronauts were awakened at 9:30 P.M. by a recording of the fight song for Georgia Tech, the alma mater of the flight commander, Capt. Richard H. Truly. They prepared for their second busy day in space, with a flight plan calling for them to deploy a communications and weather satellite for India at 3:49 A.M. Wednesday. The satellite, called Insat-1B, is regarded by the Indian Government as critical to research and technological development."

Truly of the Navy, commander of the eighth flight of the space shuttle, will be at the controls of the spacecraft Challenger when it makes the first night shuttle landing Monday, but it will not be the first time he has landed an aircraft in darkness. A naval aviator who has made many landings on a carrier deck in darkness, Captain Truly admits that at first it seemed that landing the 102- ton craft at night might be ''a very difficult thing to do in a safe manner,'' as he put it in an interview. But after many practice runs in a space shuttle simulator, he said the procedure seemed to promise ''what I think is going to be a very routine operation.'' The 45-year-old astronaut, who was born and raised in Mississippi, had little interest in aviation when young. ''I wanted to be a fire truck driver,'' he recalled. ''That seemed like an exciting thing to me when I was a kid and, as a matter of fact, it still does.''"
