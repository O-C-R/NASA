A day of this is enough to send me to the phone book for the number of an exterminator. One more rendition of ''It's a Small World After All,'' and I'm ready to call Amnesty International. All things considered then, on those infrequent occasions when the urge to visit an amusement park hits me, I'd rather be in Wildwood, New Jersey's most exuberantly declasse boardwalk resort. As the millenium approaches in a world where entertainment is all, Wildwood is the anti-Disney."
