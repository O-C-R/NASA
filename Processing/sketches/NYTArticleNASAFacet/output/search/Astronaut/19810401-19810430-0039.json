''My main claim to fame,'' she said, ''was that when I was 7 or 8, I could hit the same high note that Kate Smith hit when she sang 'God Bless America.' '' Today Miss Gurfein is the manager of a Manhattan personnel agency, Broadmore Associates. But she hasn't completely abandoned her childhood dream. She is among the 200 members of the New York Choral Society, an amateur group that meets every Tuesday night and gives three concerts a year at Carnegie Hall. Miss Gurfein, who is in her 40's, is among the many adults who, when they were children, dreamed of growing up and having a glamorous career, such as singer, dancer, actor, fireman, astronaut, professional athlete, artist or brain surgeon."

The intrepid gaze of Frank Borman, who circled the moon as commander of the Apollo 8 mission, looks out from television commercials plugging the airline he runs. The confident charm of Eugene A. Cernan, the 11th man on the moon, is used on foreign oilmen on behalf of his Houston petroleum company. Former astronauts, who put in time as spokesmen, pitchmen and front men, are finding it far less lonely and much more profitable in the marketplace than in space and on the moon. All told, almost half of the 38 astronauts who have left the space program and the armed services - by resignation or retirement - have entered the world of business, doing work that includes advertising, sales, marketing and development."

The fires are a testing. A people are testing themselves in relation to their heritage of steamboats, Conestoga wagons, railroads and airplanes, seeking reassurance that over the years the old vigor and resourcefulness have not left them. A people are testing their resolve to reach beyond the ordinary and thereby, if history repeats, magnify the human spirit."

Meanwhile, East Germany's official press agency reported that thousands of fresh troops had joined the extended Warsaw Pact maneuvers. (Page A1, Column 6.) President Reagan sent a message to Leonid I. Brezhnev, expressing extreme concern over the Soviet threat to Poland, according to an American official.

Flashing across the North Pacific, it will undergo a gradual metamorphosis. By the time it passes over Big Sur, it will have been transformed from a ballistic spacecraft into an aerodynamic glider. And when its commander, John W. Young, nurses the space shuttle Columbia to a dead-stick landing at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert in southern California, the era of routine, workaday space travel will have dawned. Ready to greet that dawn is a whole new family of spacefaring Americans and Europeans consisting of about 80 young men and women. Two-thirds of them have been appointed astronauts or astronaut candidates only in the last three years."

In orbit, the shuttle consists of three sections. The forward one houses the flight crew and specialists in a casual, shirt-sleeve setting. The elongated central section, with four doors that open into space, carries the cargo."

Thus far, President Reagan has had little to say publicly about the shuttle, and efforts today to find a spokesman at the White House to express Mr. Reagan's views for the record were unavailing. This leaves Mr. Reagan in the political position of being able to embrace the program as his own if Friday's shot succeeds or to remain aloof if it fails."

Though this radically new venture is even more demanding than the landing on the moon, the mood of the public is subdued, and many Americans are mystified. Will a successful flight mark a milestone in man's conquest of space - or the evolution of a technological white elephant? If all goes well, the flight of the shuttle will be an unquestionable technological achievement. It is the first reusable space vehicle, designed to make a hundred trips aloft. It has had to meet far higher engineering standards than conventional space vehicles, which can be battered and scorched during the single mission for which they are built, then discarded."

But until the computer problem in the spaceship could be corrected the officials were unable to say when the re-usable winged Columbia would be cleared for another launching attempt. Tonight engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston identified the source of the malfunction as a timing fault in one set of spaceship computers that disrupted communications with the backup computer."

He returned to earth safe and an international hero. Some called him ''the Columbus of the Interplanetary Age.'' ''Let the capitalist countries try to catch up,'' said Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, in declaring a victory over the United States and its space efforts. Three weeks later, on May 5, the United States sent up Comdr. Alan B.

The 224-square-mile region, resembling a mountain-ringed patch of Antarctica transported to New Mexico, would be familiar terrain, for it was here that the astronauts trained in a Grumman Gulfstream executive-type jet that was radically modified to fly like the shuttle. However, the seven-mile unpaved landing strip of hard-packed gypsum would look very different from the way they remembered it in their training. Poised alongside it would be a convoy of fire trucks, crash wagons with people in escape suits, specialists with sensors to detect explosion hazards, three crash rescue helicopters, vans with television crews on the roofs and six buses aimed away from the strip for a quick getaway."

Clines uring an awful day of delays at New York City's La Guardia Airport, a planeload of Eastern Air Lines shuttle passengers were kept strapped and wondering in their narrowly packed seats and, as precious business time slipped by, some of them tried to rebel creatively. At the instigation of Carl Bernstein, Washington bureau chief of ABC News, they composed a group letter of complaint to Frank Borman, Eastern's chief executive. ''Dear Captain Astronaut,'' the desperately merry band began, ''we are being held captive on your airplane. ...'' Eventually they were set free and the letter was mailed, but their originality went unrequited. ''We got back a form letter,'' recalls Mr. Bernstein, who found this impersonal touch amusingly typical of the shuttle he has come to know, to rely on and, he adds, to resent after more than a decade's regular patronage."

Gagarin into a 108-minute single orbit of Earth. The Soviet Union's historic achievement culminated more than three years of scientific and technological effort that had begun with the first Sputnik satellite launch in October 1957 and would end 11 years later with the United States landing the first men on the moon. Now the space shuttle has become the centerpiece of America's space program. The Soviet Union has taken a different path in space exploration, leading to manned orbiting space stations."

Minutes later, 21 vehicles, a motorized convoy unlike any ever assembled before, will begin racing across the lake bed toward the ship. Led by a motor home outwardly similar to those used by thousands of Americans for recreational trips, the convoy will contain safety inspectors in space suits, a wind machine like those Hollywood directors use to simulate storms, crash trucks and a curious array of other vehicles designed to insure the safety of the astronauts and their spaceship once they have landed. A fleet of rescue helicopters will be standing by to act in case the ship crashes in the nearby hills or to serve as airborne ambulances if it becomes necessary to move the astronauts to a specially alerted hospital trauma team more than 60 miles away."

      "lead_paragraph": "While John Young was establishing himself in the last two decades as one of the premier astronauts of the early space age, Bob Crippen was waiting. For 15 years he waited. That is how long he was an astronaut before he made his first trip into space. But if he felt any acute frustration during the long, dry years that led to today's launching of the space shuttle Columbia, it is belied by his bright disposition, his affability, his aura of casual confidence. His flashing teeth and slightly aging good looks evoke similar reactions from many who meet him: If Hollywood was casting the Columbia crew, it would surely pick Capt. Robert Laurel Crippen of the Navy."

The liftoff, transmitted by satellite to millions of television viewers, was widely interpreted as a successful American resurgence in space flight on the 20th anniversary of the first manned flight into space by Yuri A. Gagarin, the Soviet astronaut. Unlike the earlier Mercury and Apollo space launchings, which generated so much initial excitement and a clear sense of American technological achievement, yesterday's takeoff was viewed by many Americans with far more confidence that it would succeed and with a quieter sense of pride and accomplishment when it did. Marty McCarthy, an electronics technician in Chicago, and his wife, Joyce, represented a range of reaction in this country. Mr. McCarthy said he was so excited that tears came to his eyes as he watched television in his bedroom and saw the Columbia roar off its pad and soar into space."

Soon after they settled into orbit, John W. Young, a civilian, and Capt. Robert L. Crippen of the Navy focused a television camera on the Columbia's tail section and discovered that more than a dozen heat-shielding tiles had ripped off, possibly because of the stresses of launching. Project officials said that the tile loss should not shorten the flight or endanger the lives of the astronauts when the Columbia plunges back into the atmosphere, glowing red-hot from frictional heat, to attempt a runway landing Tuesday. The projected 36-orbit, 54 1/2-hour flight is scheduled to end at Edwards Air Force Base in California. 'We've Got a Super Vehicle' ''I'm just not concerned about it,'' Neil B. Hutchinson, a flight director at Mission Control in Houston, said in discussing the tile problem at a news conference this afternoon. ''We've got a super vehicle up there.''"

That way I could have got a lot of rich kids and put a black filling in their mouth. The dean said, 'Always try to be a little different.' And today I make speeches all over. People ask me, 'Casey, how can you speak so much when you don't talk English too good?' Well, I've been invited to Europe, and I say, 'They don't speak English over there too good, either.' '' The discourse took place in the Met dugout on a summer day about a decade after Stengel's retirement as manager and a year before he died, at age 85, in 1975. A shock of white hair fell boyishly across the side of his face, a face as wrinkled as an elephant hide. His blue eyes were rheumy, and he wiped them with a large handkerchief. He wore a natty dark suit and was shod in black slippers because his feet hurt, but he'd jump up on bandy legs to make a point, gesturing and declaiming in his froggy voice."

Touchdown came at 1:21 P.M., Eastern standard time. ''Welcome home, Columbia!'' was the simple message from Joseph Allen in Mission Control. 215 Miles an Hour Capt. Robert L.

John W. Young, commander of the mission, gave a thumbs-up signal to the ground crews and punched the air after leaving the craft's cockpit where he and his junior pilot, Capt. Robert L. Crippen of the Navy, had bided their time - Mr. Young with obvious impatience - for an hour after the 1:21 P.M. landing. Mr. Young, who is 50 years old and has ridden more space missions of greater variety than any other human being, exultantly examined the life-saving thermal tiles on the Columbia's underbelly. ''You can't believe what a flying machine this is!'' he said. ''It's really something special.''"

Though he did not refer to the successful flight of the American space shuttle Columbia, his remarks, made at a Soviet space ceremony, appeared to reflect Moscow's stated concern over the military potential of the shuttle program. In the minimal coverage they gave to Columbia's liftoff and its return to earth, Soviet television and Tass, the official press agency, portrayed the new spaceship as primarily an instrument for testing laser weapons and ''killer satellites'' in space. In advance of the test flight, the Soviet press accused the Pentagon of seeking to turn space into a battle arena."

But so what? After the almost faultless flight and spectacular, ontime landing last week, no one was complaining. This ''brave adventure,'' said President Reagan, has ''put new worlds within closer reach and more knowledge within our grasp.'' ''We're really not too far, the human race isn't, from going to the stars,'' observed astronaut John W. Young. And in a wry reference to the history of engineering mishaps and doubts over the shuttle's workability, the director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Christopher C. Kraft Jr., noted, ''We just became infinitely smarter.''"

Although Mr. Bradley's second novel, ''The Chaneysville Incident,'' is by no stretch of the imagination humorous, its author, in person, exhibits the same sidelong view of life that en-livened the narrative voice of his first book. Mr. Bradley, whose father was a minister and historian, was born in Bedford, Pa. in 1950 and grew up in a rural area where he estimates there were about 100 blacks in a county with a population of 30,000. ''The southern part of Bedford County was originally a part of Maryland,'' he says. ''And the town of Bedford is perilously close to the Mason-Dixon line. This is one of those places where the stories about one brother fighting for the Union Army and another for the Confederacy originated. It was not that hospitable for blacks - or that comfortable. ''It's a farm country, and I grew up feeding chickens,'' he says, ''but there were always books around our house. My father attended the University of Pittsburgh and began his doctoral work at New York University before settling in Bedford. He wrote several books on the history of the Methodist Church and published them privately."

Senator East, a conservative who is a strong foe of abortion, said at the opening of the hearing that the statute under consideration was designed to ''vitiate, negate'' a 1973 Supreme Court ruling that gave women a constitutional right to an abortion. The statute is sponsored by Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, and Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina."

      "lead_paragraph": "The measure under consideration was a bill declaring that human life begins at conception, thus making abortion equivalent to murder and criminally punishable. The sessions, held in a packed Senate hearing room over two days last week, were as highly charged as the issue itself. All five witnesses called by a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the first day testified that life begins at conception. Prof. Hymie Gordon, chairman of the Department of Medical Genetics at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said this was ''an established fact.'' Dr. Jerome Lejeune, professor of fundamental genetics at the University of Rene Descartes in Paris, compared the fertilized egg to Tom Thumb or an astronaut. Dr. Micheline Matthews-Roth said ''It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception, when egg and sperm join to form the zygote, and that this developing human always is a member of our species in all stages of life.''"
