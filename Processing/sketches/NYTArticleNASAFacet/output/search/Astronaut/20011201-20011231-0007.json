      "lead_paragraph": "On a white-sky November day, Wes Anderson is lounging in a darkened studio in the Brill Building, formerly the silvery hub of Tin Pan Alley. His slight six-foot frame, all 155 pounds of it, is decked out in undersize beige corduroys and an undersize beige shirt; his auburn hair, once unruly, has settled into a subtle and rather stylish alliance of tamed cowlicks. ''We're doing a weird little recording session,'' he quietly explains. ''Yesterday, our editor was whistling along with the soundtrack, and I thought, Wait -- that's good!'' Anderson immediately realized that this was a perfect touch. It matched the sound in his head that, somehow, this crucial scene lacked. So, at this late stage in the editing process of his new movie, ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' -- and despite the fact that the Brill Building is teeming with musicians -- he has enlisted a ragtag assortment of crew members to lay down a whistling track, which will then be added to the score."

Kubrick's insights into the destructive nature of mankind, a constant in all his films, has kept his message, and the movie, alive these past 30 years."
