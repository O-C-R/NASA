William Morrow & Company. $21. \"Artistic Differences,\" with a title meaning either \"I quit\" or \"you're fired\" in Hollywoodese, is a caustically funny account of star temperament within the world of network television. The novelist, Charlie Hauck, clearly knows his terrain. As a consequence of having variously written, produced and created seven half-hour comedy series (among them \"The Associates\") and living \"in Los Angeles, about 10 blocks from Michelle Pfeiffer\" (according to the jacket copy), Mr. Hauck keenly appreciates the rules of the game. \"Never let the star know that there are other people in the world\" is one of the helpful hints his story provides."

The danger was high because 800 tons of volatile fuels had begun to burn explosively in the normal process of combustion, not unlike a bomb whose fuse had been lit. But NASA, poised with a host of safety precautions, quickly drenched the main engines and the rear of the spacecraft with water."

Nevin's hallucinatory letter (Aug. 1) by convincing yourself that readers would discredit his Holocaust denial because he also denies the truth of the \"moon landings.\" But just as two wrongs do not make a right, two falsehoods do not justify your providing important and limited space to an anti-Semitic and anti-astronaut kook. A decision by The Times to publish a letter carries with it some degree of responsibility. A letters page is not like the speakers' stand in Hyde Park, since you reject most of the letters submitted to you. Unfortunately, some of your readers will never get to the last paragraph of the letter, and a few may even believe it because it has the imprimatur of a great newspaper. ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ Cambridge, Mass."
