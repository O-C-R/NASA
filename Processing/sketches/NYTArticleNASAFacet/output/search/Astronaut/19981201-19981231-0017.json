After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launching went off flawlessly at 3:36 this morning, right on schedule. The night sky was clear, and the moon full. With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly turned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five minutes and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be seen in the distance, twinkling like a new star."

Volumes surveying places far and near -- Algeria, India, Jerusalem, South Africa, New York City -- abound. That's par for the course, though; what's interesting is that American trade publishers are increasingly relying on offshore imprints for their titles. Art houses like Editions du Seuil in Paris, Phaidon in London and Scalo and Edition Stemmle in Zurich are the source of many of the most beautiful and interesting books this year, but you often have to look carefully to tell. The trend has a downside: for all the virtues of the photographs, the texts in these books can be stiffly translated and negligible in terms of scholarship. As for American specialized publishers, Arena Editions, now in its second year, continues to take chances with a volume on the emerging photo artist Vik Muniz, and Distributed Art Publishers adds to its publishing record a new and different Lee Friedlander book. Fans of more classic modern photography have to be content with the recycled images of some of their favorites -- books on the work of Margaret Bourke-White, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Man Ray and W. Eugene Smith are new this year but not especially novel. The nominees for the most interesting faded reputations to be brought back to light are Ellen Auerbach and Lottie Jacobi, two Bauhaus-era women whose careers are more interesting than the books devoted to them. Landscape photography also takes a new turn that is less skeptical than in recent years. But the expanding universe of photography books is a great deal larger than this suggests, as readers will discover soon enough on their holiday bookstore rounds."

You can roll his dresses into a ball, they take up practically no room in your luggage, they weigh almost nothing, and when you arrive at your destination you just unroll and wear them. You can brown bag it around the world. In ''Issey Miyake: Making Things,'' a show of the last 10 years of the Japanese designer's work now on view at the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Paris, Miyake stages a witty play on the ease of traveling with his clothes. A huge wheel of black stretch fabric stands upright in the corner of one gallery. Partly unrolled across the floor, the fabric forms a continuous train that connects a tableau of five dresses, all made from the same material. It's a transformation scene, a metamorphosis in style. You could take the wheel anywhere, unroll a few dozen yards, snip, snip, et voila! Instant fashion show. (Flashbulbs not included.)"
