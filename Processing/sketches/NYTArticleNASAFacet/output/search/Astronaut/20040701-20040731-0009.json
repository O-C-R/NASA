      "lead_paragraph": "Sharps A recently published book called ''The Male Mystique'' offers a collection of ads from men's magazines of the 60's and 70's. Among other things, it makes a convincing case that the marketer's construction of manhood has been conflicted and simpleminded for a long time: macho oafs, shameless peacocks and the interchangeable ''groovy'' chicks who love them fill out pitches for Bacchus after-shave, Score Liquid Hair Groom and something called Male Comfort Spray (which ''helps prevent perspiration discomfort, the kind only a man can get''). That stuff, whatever it was, seems mercifully to have faded from the scene. Men's grooming products are now a $1-billion-plus category, with a snowballing number of new offerings. But the marketing dichotomy lingers in the form of two caricatures of maleness: the ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' guy vs. the Maxim guy. Still, one new brand, a small New York startup called Sharps, seems almost explicitly designed as an attempt to find a third way. Though around only since last year, it has found its way into top-end retailers like Barneys and Fred Segal, as well as newish boutique barbershop chains like American Male. One of its most popular items, called Kid Glove Shave Gel, is a top seller at the Barneys in Beverly Hills. Through Sharps's online store, it sells to customers in all but a handful of states, thanks to attention from magazines like InStyle and Men's Health."

If the two concepts don't really mesh, the film, directed by Jonathan Frakes, maintains the frantic, fractured momentum of a Saturday morning cartoon as its heroes, the Tracys, a squeaky-clean clan of space-age goody-goods, do battle with the Hood (Ben Kingsley), a greedy glowering villain with a chip on his shoulder. Hood, whose malevolent gaze unleashes telekinetic powers, plans to hijack the Tracys' 21st-century technology to rob the world's 10 largest banks, starting with the Bank of England."
