Scores of these beauties, built when cotton was king and the railroad made millionaires, are lovingly restored and on display. Today Macon's battle is to overcome the legacy of segregation and the commercial shift to the suburbs. Preservationists and energetic officials have worked to restore buildings to their 19th-century splendor and to build a collection of attractions celebrating the city's rich history. In the spring, especially when its 275,000 cherry trees are in bloom, Macon basks in mild weather, bejeweled with flowers. KIMBERLY BROWN Friday 6 p.m."

''I was surprised,'' he recalled recently. ''At the time, I had no political connections. N.S.F. just liked the proposal, I guess.'' As time passed, Mr. Ehlers developed lots of political connections, working as the science adviser to Gerald R. Ford, who was then a congressman, becoming the first research physicist elected to Congress, in 1993, and today serving on both the education and science committees in the House. And through it all, Representative Ehlers, a moderate Republican with a doctorate from Berkeley, has remained a big fan of the science agency."
