The crew of seven, including a United States Senator, will be deploying two communications satellites on the first two days, observing the effects of weightlessness on human physiology and conducting a number of tests of biological products that could lead to life-saving drugs. Hope to Resume Schedule At a news conference, Jesse W. Moore, head of the shuttle project for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said: ''We're ready to fly. We've got the leak under control and also contained. Everything is going well in the processing.''"

In addition, a serious film with a predominantly black cast, ''A Soldier's Story,'' will turn a profit. And one successful movie, ''The Killing Fields,'' was not only about Asians but also co-starred Dr. Haing S. Ngor, a Cambodian who won best supporting actor for his role. He was the first Asian to win an acting Oscar since Miyoshi Umeki took supporting actress honors for ''Sayonara'' in 1957."

      "lead_paragraph": "''James A. Michener's 'Space' '' - that's the offical title - is one of those grand and glossy productions that add up, almost amazingly, to vintage television. The 13- hour mini-series, made at a cost of more than $30 million, gets underway on CBS this evening at 8 with a three-hour installment. The rest will be broadcast tomorrow through Thursday, which means a significant commitment of time for even the most ardent of viewers. What they will get is not so much Mr. Michener's ''Space'' as Dick Berg's version of the best-selling novel. Mr. Berg is the producer of this television extravaganza and, along with Sterling Silliphant, the co-writer. The overall plot outline and the major characters of the book have been retained, but television's ''Space'' makes its own distinctive adjustments. Mr. Berg has candidly explained: ''What we have tried to do is to make this a mini- series about the relationships between people, not about hardware. We do deal with the technology and we have our special effects, but 'Space' essentially is an adult drama dealing with adult themes in a contemporary, and hopefully fresh, fashion.'' In other words, friends, television's ''Space'' is a kind of ''Dallas'' with astronauts. With a bow to contemporary technology centers, it could be aptly titled ''Houston'' or ''Canaveral.''"

It's only a matter of time, according to NASA. The Discovery, launched Friday, is carrying Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, as the first orbiting politician. In the next 41 shuttle missions over 33 months, the guest list will include a schoolteacher (to be selected this summer) and astronauts from nine foreign countries."

The winged spaceship is scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center here Friday at 7:16 A.M. If necessary, the Discovery could stay in orbit two more days. In their week in space, two days longer than originally planned, the Discovery crew deployed two communication satellites, one for Canada and the other for a Defense Department network. The Canadian satellite worked perfectly. But Leasat 3, owned by the Hughes Aircraft Company and leased to the Navy, failed immediately after deployment and, despite an improvised recovery attempt by the astronauts, was left floating powerless in a useless orbit."

Thugs of all types have taken over Nova Scotia, which makes things tough for an honorable astronaut named Howe and a pretty young woman nicknamed J. J., who spend most of the movie trying to get away from the fallout - nuclear and human - and sail to the safety of Central America."

THEY'VE got only two days more to wait, but Tuesday can't come soon enough for three Long Island teachers who have been in orbit since it was announced that they were among the New York State finalists in NASA's competition to select the first teacher to go into space. The educators - Susan Agruso, 33 years old, of Coram, a physics teacher at East Islip High School; Paul Stengel, 41, of Water Mill, a physics teacher at Shoreham-Wading River High School, and Richard Posner, 40, of Selden, an English teacher at Sachem North High School - learned two weeks ago that they had been selected as three of the five state finalists. The two other finalists are from Schenectady and Orange County. The five were selected from 721 New York teachers who went through a rigorous application process, writing essays, getting recommendations and developing original proposals for space projects. ''Since I found out I go from nerves to enthusiasm to nerves,'' said Mrs. Agruso, the only female finalist in the state. ''On Tuesday I could be the most depressed person in New York State.''"

This time hopes are pinned on the Navy's plan to assign a new battleship squadron to the Gulf of Mexico as the military bolsters its ability to meet future tasks in this hemisphere. Pensacola, with its deepwater bay and its naval air station, is considered a leader in the competition for designation this spring as the home port. If Pensacola is chosen, all or most of the squadron's nine large ships of war, including the refitted battleship U.S.S. Wisconsin, would be based here, adding an estimated $50 million a year to the local economy and bringing in 9,000 sailors and their dependents. The naval air station, which dates to 1914, already has some 16,000 officers and enlisted men."
