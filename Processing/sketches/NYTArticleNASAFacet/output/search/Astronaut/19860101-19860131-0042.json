      "lead_paragraph": "IT'S SUCH A QUANTUM leap from what my life has been like,'' Christa McAuliffe was saying. A frown shadowed her brow. It was the frown of recurring disbelief, not of worry. So much had happened since July, when she was chosen from 11,000 schoolteacher applicants to be the first ''private citizen'' to fly in space. There was the White House ceremony, the onslaught of reporters and television cameras, the hometown parade. Then came the exchange of her high-school classroom for the high-tech simulators at Houston's Johnson Space Center, and the moment she stood on the launching pad at Cape Canaveral and got a close look at the space shuttle Challenger, which is to carry her, a 37-year-old teacher from Concord, N.H., into orbit next month. ''It just didn't hit home that the rockets are going to go off and I'm going to be 200 miles up in space,'' the mother of two recalled. ''It still doesn't seem possible.'' Yet, by all accounts, Christa McAuliffe has handled the quantum leap with aplomb and delight. She had just experienced weightlessness: the KC-135 climbed to a crest and then went into a headlong plunge. There she was, walking on the ceiling, then floating in the cabin like Superman. The experience can be euphoric and sometimes nauseous, which is why the training plane is called the ''vomit comet.'' Her trainers said she came through like a fully fledged astronaut."

According to Air Force meteorologists, Tuesday's forecast calls for clouds and a chance of rain."

Several studies conducted in the United States and England in the last five years have shown that about 75 percent of migraine patients are allergic to five or more foods, while some patients are allergic to 20 or more foods. When the patients were placed on diets that eliminated or drastically reduced contact with such ''trigger'' foods, their migraine headaches stopped or became less frequent and severe. Despite the gathering evidence implicating food allergies, many specialists are not fully persuaded of their importance and say they are awaiting more data. Most physicians agree that headaches, including migraines, are a symptom and not a disease. That is, there are underlying mechanisms that give rise to the sensation of head pain. Migraines affect one side of the head with pain lasting from a few hours to more than a week. Between 10 million and 20 million Americans experience migraines."

''This is the perfect man-bites-dog story,'' said Mr. Thompson, who found himself answering questions this week from curious radio stations in San Antonio, Phoenix and St. Louis. The radio commentator Paul Harvey took note of his appointment, as did a Washington Post columnist who mentioned that Mr. Thompson ''won't be asked to type.''"

He came to the United States in 1968 with a one-way airplane ticket, $50 in his pocket, a suitcase, and a dream to fly in space. He had written to the rocket scientist Wernher von Braun asking advice on how to become an astronaut, and Dr. von Braun wrote back, telling the young man to come to America and study science. That was all the encouragement he needed. Relatives in Connecticut agreed to give him a home, and Franklin enrolled in public high school in Hartford. He nearly flunked out at first, but as his English improved so did his grades, and by graduation he had won a scholarship to the University of Connecticut."

Within hours, the astronauts launched a $50 million communications satellite for the RCA Corporation and prepared for experiments in materials science, astrophysics, and the life sciences. Later in the mission the crew is to make the first extensive observations from space of Halley's comet. The flight is the first of three consecutive flights that are to study the comet. Other nations have launched spacecraft toward the comet, but they are not yet in position."

Space agency officials, concerned about the ambitious schedule of 15 shuttle flights planned for this year, told the crew that a shortened, four-day mission would allow more flexibility in the face of impending bad weather, which could delay their return. ''We really appreciate your hard work,'' James Wetherbee of mission control in Houston radioed to the astronauts while telling them of the truncated mission. ''We'd like to let you stay a little bit longer, but we can't, so we'll bring you back one day early.''"

Nesbitt, the public affairs officer, routinely reported its position a minute and 15 seconds after launching as 7 nautical miles downrage. In fact, the craft had already exploded and was dropping into the Atlantic Ocean. There was a long pause, then Mr. Nesbitt, who had apparently been tracking the radar, continued: ''Flight controller here looking very carefully at situation. Obviously a major malfunction.''"

Today is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss. Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground, but we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle but they, the Challenger seven, were aware of the dangers and overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly."

Wherever Americans were when they heard the news - at work, at school or at home - they shared their grief over the death of the seven astronauts, among them one who had captured their imaginations, Christa McAuliffe, the teacher from Concord, N.H., who was to have been the first ordinary citizen to go into space. Shortly before noon, when the first word of the explosion came, daily events seemed to stop as people awaited the details and asked the same questions: ''What happened? Are there any survivors?'' In offices, restaurants and stores, people gathered in front of television sets, mesmerized by the terrible scene of the shuttle exploding, a scene that would be replayed throughout the day and night. Children who had learned about Mrs. McAuliffe were watching in classrooms across the country."

It will also raise troubling questions about the long-term future of the manned space program, according to a variety of space analysts. The accident will inevitably put a big crimp in the space agency's plans to launch 15 shuttle missions this year, far more than ever before. The most immediate impact will be postponement of future shuttle activities until a formal investigation is concluded and any needed corrective action is completed. That delay could force postponement of long-awaited missions to the sun and to Jupiter, as well as the launching of a huge space telescope later this year."

Many of those who reflected on the disaster tell how it appeared from their perspective, as religious leaders, writers, students, psychiatrists, educators, scientists and test pilots. Daniel J. Boorstin The Librarian of Congress I have a terrible feeling of sadness, I want to weep. In the long run, this shows us that the best things in life are not free. It makes us more grateful to the people who have been taking these risks all along without our knowing it. I hope this won't stop the space program, I don't think it will. Sir Francis Drake, Magellan, countless other great explorers lost their lives; this happens in any great adventure. It's sad it has to happen but somebody has to take these chances if we're to do things that have never been done before."

West Coast viewers of NBC saw the tragedy when it happened at 11:38 A.M., Eastern time; John Palmer reported, with live film, on ''Today.'' The Cable News Network, which regularly covers space missions, also had live coverage. Then, within minutes, CBS and ABC had the story. By noon, anchormen from all three networks were on the air."

Nowhere was the mourning, the sense of helpless grief, greater than in the communities that have sprung up around the sprawling Johnson Space Center, 25 miles south of downtown Houston, where the dead astronauts were just neighbors, fellow churchgoers, people who mowed their lawns on Saturdays. With a walkie-talkie in hand, Stan Avent was standing guard this afternoon in front of the neat, tan-brick home in Clear Lake City where his neighbor, Lieut. Col. Ellison S. Onizuka of the Air Force, had lived. ''What can I say?'' asked Mr. Avent, who, like Colonel Onizuka, was an employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ''I was a friend and I've lost a close friend. I'm grieving like everybody else.''"

She said she thought of the gift on Tuesday when she saw a parachute emerge from the sky just after the space shuttle Challenger exploded. But the parachute seen on television did not save Mrs. McAuliffe or her colleagues on the shuttle; it had apparently been attached to one of the booster rockets. Virginia Timmons remembered how pleasant it was when Mrs. McAuliffe, her next-door neighbor, came over for coffee on the afternoon of New Year's Eve, and she and other women from the neighborhood talked about children, homes and cross-country skiing."

Some Muscovites reported disbelief among their acquaintances that such a disaster could strike an American spaceship. ''Russians have been raised with a strong faith in American technology, and people couldn't believe that this could happen,'' said one middle-aged man. ''They were surprised to learn that there was no ejection mechanism.''"

The question has arisen time and again since the space age began in the 1950's, and while space travel has become ever more sophisticated, the arguments about humans versus machines in space have remained basically the same. The position held by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a succession of American Presidents is that mankind must expand the horizons of knowledge and that no machines will ever be invented that can make judgments as well as human beings. On the other side, some scientists and politicians hold that remote-control robots and cameras can perform almost every identifiable mission in space at a far lower cost in terms of money and human lives. Both sides agree on one point: Had it not been for the drama provided by men in space - from the first flights of Yuri A. Gagarin and Alan B. Shepard Jr. through the landing on the moon in 1969 and the shuttle flights of recent years - Congress and the American people would have been less enthusiastic about providing the backing for the space program."

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration refused to permit any of its officials to discuss the expanding investigation into the disaster Tuesday or to speculate on the possible causes of the worst accident in the nation's 25 years of spacefaring. In a brief statement tonight, the space agency said the National Transportation Safety Board was joining the investigation, providing its expertise in reconstructing airplane accidents and their causes. The NASA panel met all day at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and was to resume its work Friday at the Johnson Space Center here."
