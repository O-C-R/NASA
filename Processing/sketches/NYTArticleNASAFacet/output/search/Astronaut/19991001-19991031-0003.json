It was like watching some nerveless kid play pinball in a minefield, his body flexed into the machine, his shoulders and his arrogant hips seeming to drive it into Charlie Parker choruses of bell-ringing. It's a wonder to see such prowess, and in ''Fight Club'' (which opened Friday) I'm talking about not just the creation of some grunge-heaven city but the macabre yoking together of gallows humor and smash-mouth violence, the interplay of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, nerd and Neo (in the sense of the Keanu Reeves icon from that empty but deeply influential film ''The Matrix''). But this is one of the most glossy and treacherous pieces of cinematic black ice we have yet encountered, with good old photography turning into effects beneath our drifting tires. Then the pinball wizard grows bored with his own brilliance. He turns away, and in one ruinous glimpse you see that he's not just a child but a kind of retard, too. In anything but pinball, he's in his own Alzheimer's."
