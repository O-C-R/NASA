Taylor, chief of staff for the City Council and chief mouthpiece for Mr. Miller, would prefer to be known by a manlier moniker and even went so far as to suggest a replacement nickname: Turbo! But Teddy Bear it is. As Mr. Taylor, 40 and immaculately attired behind spiffy navy blue suspenders, is fond of reminding himself, what the speaker says, goes. ''I work for a politician, so it's all about his vision,'' says Mr. Taylor, feet propped on his desk, hands clasped behind his head, sweat stains on display at the end of another endless day at City Hall. He claims his five months on this job feel like a lifetime; he is counting the hours to a week's vacation in Brazil. Not that he's complaining."

I went back and looked at my favorite book, Dickens's ''Our Mutual Friend'' and that ending was very nice. He kind of stuck it to the petty people in the book at the end. There's an Icelandic story that I really like called ''Egil's Saga'' that's about a very bad man -- he's a warrior and he does a lot of ill-turns in the course of his life and the saga ends with him as a very old man being pushed around and reprimanded by the servant women for being in the way. I really love that ending."
