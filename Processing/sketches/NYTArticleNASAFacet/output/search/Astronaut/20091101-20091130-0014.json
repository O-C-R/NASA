Handsome, sharp and sure of themselves, mostly in their 70s, they look as if they met in college or were the members of a particularly effective Junior League. Their bond is more unusual, however, a shared circumstance that made them famous as it enslaved them. They were all wives of Apollo astronauts, the relatively small number of men who trained for and, if they were chosen, joined one of the 12 manned Apollo missions. While their husbands became a new breed of hero, the wives achieved a symbolic status of their own as the women who waited, gathered in groups around radios and television sets."
