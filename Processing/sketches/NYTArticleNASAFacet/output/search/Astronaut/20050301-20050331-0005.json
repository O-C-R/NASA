      "lead_paragraph": "THESE days he's the host of a new reality television series about boxing (''The Contender''), but there was a time, of course, when Sylvester Stallone was doing the punching, and never with more metaphorical baggage on his back than in ROCKY IV (1985). After his friend Apollo Creed is killed in the ring by Drago, a Soviet fighter played by Dolph Lundgren, Rocky is compelled to challenge the gigantic fellow. In 1985, it was a match reflective of the cold war, but today the movie has a new timeliness: it feels like a commentary on baseball's steroid debate. Drago follows a high-tech training regimen that, as one of his handlers says, ''makes a man a better man, a great athlete a super-athlete,'' and though he denies using steroids, later he is seen getting an injection of something -- Saturday at 10 p.m. on AMC. Lately Hollywood has been exploring the notion that boxing isn't just for guys, with Meg Ryan doing her incongruous part in AGAINST THE ROPES (2004). The story is loosely based on the life of Jackie Kallen, a fight manager who made a name for herself in a very male universe. The film focuses on her relationship with one boxer, played by Omar Epps, and is too determined to be inspirational, but it has its moments. Tim Daly and Tony Shalhoub from the old sitcom ''Wings'' are reunited, Mr. Daly as a sports reporter and Mr. Shalhoub as a nasty boxing kingpin -- Tuesday at 8 p.m. on Showtime."

      "lead_paragraph": "Havel May Return to Writing Vaclav Havel, right, the playwright and former president of the Czech Republic, may resume his literary career soon, the BBC reported. An aide said that Mr. Havel, 68, was preparing to spend two months studying at the Library of Congress in Washington, though his schedule was not announced. He has said he plans to write an autobiography as well as a play based on Shakespeare's ''King Lear.'' He has also discussed publishing a book of conversations with friends, including the former Polish dissident and journalist Adam Michnik and the British historian Timothy Garton Ash, the BBC said. Mr. Havel led the Velvet Revolution in the former Czechoslovakia and was president of that country from 1989 to 1992, and of the new Czech Republic from 1993 to 2003, when he retired. A former chain smoker, he has long suffered from respiratory problems and had twice postponed his trip to Washington because of illness, but his aide Jakub Hladik said that he was now in good health. White Stripes Complete New Album White Stripes, the scrappy yet arty million-selling garage-rock duo from Detroit, has completed work on its fifth album, a spokeswoman said. It was recorded by Jack White, the singer, guitarist and songwriter, at his Third Man Studio in Detroit, and is scheduled to be released June 14 on the V2 label. A title was not announced. All the songs are White Stripes originals, and Meg White, the drummer, sings one song. The band will tour Mexico, Central and South America beginning May 11 and will headline the big Glastonbury festival in England in June, then tour Eastern Europe. American tour dates have not yet been announced. Release of New Pop CD's New albums to be released tomorrow include ''Guero'' by Beck, left, his first new album in three years and his reunion with the Dust Brothers, the producers who worked on Beck's breakthrough 1996 album, ''Odelay''; the self-titled debut album by the Bravery, the latest group to be called New York's newest next big thing, released on the Island label; ''The B-Coming'' (Def Jam), the long-delayed new album by the rapper Beanie Sigel, which was produced by Kanye West, RZA and other hip-hop heavy hitters; Will Smith's ''Lost and Found'' (Interscope), with guest appearances by Snoop Dogg, Timbaland, Ludacris, Mr. West and Mary J. Blige; the punk band Thrice's ''If We Could Only See Us Now'' (Island); and the rap group 112's ''Pleasure and Pain'' (Def Soul Classics), with appearances by Jay-Z, T.I. and Foxy Brown. This week will also see a number of releases in the new DualDisc format, which has a CD on one side of a disc and a DVD on the other and has proved surprisingly popular with consumers. This week Sony will release DualDisc versions of various new and old albums, among them Duran Duran's ''Astronaut,'' above, Nellie McKay's ''Get Away From Me,'' Gretchen Wilson's ''Here for the Party,'' the Indigo Girls' ''All That We Let In'' and Good Charlotte's ''Chronicles of Life and Death.'' China Bans Mao Satire Chinese censors have banned a steamy, satirical novella in which an army officer's wife and her lover defile and destroy images of Mao Zedong while in the throes of passion. The Guardian in London reported that the book, ''Serve the People'' (named after one of Mao's most famous slogans) had been rejected for publication and that a magazine serializing it had been pulled from the shelves. Set in 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, the book, by the Chinese author Yan Lianke tells the story of the bored wife of a military commander who seduces a young peasant soldier. Whenever their passion flags, they smash her husband's beloved Mao icons, rip up the Little Red Book or urinate on the premier's epigrams. ''This novella slanders Mao Zedong, the army, and is overflowing with sex,'' said the edict by the propaganda department as quoted in The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong daily. ''Do not distribute, pass around, comment on, excerpt from or report on it.'' New Literary Festival Margaret Atwood, Jonathan Franzen, Ha Jin, E.L. Doctorow, Wole Soyinka, Michael Ondaatje and other leading literary figures are to take part in a new festival sponsored by the PEN American Center, the society of editors and writers. PEN World Voices: the New York Festival of International Literature, with programs heavily focused on international politics and current events, is to open on April 16 at the New York Public Library with three events: a tribute to Cervantes's ''Don Quixote'' on its 400th anniversary; a conversation between Paul Auster and the Brazilian songwriter Chico Buarque; and a discussion called ''Writing and Catastrophe,'' with François Bizot, Philip Gourevitch and others. The festival is to last a week and is planned as an annual event. Among the other expected participants are Rick Moody, Gish Jen, José Manuel Prieto, Gary Shteyngart, Nuruddin Farah and Elena Poniatowska. Salman Rushdie, the president of PEN, said in a statement that the festival ''embodies PEN's belief that writers can help to mediate cultural and political differences and widen this country's field of vision in the world.'' Hong Kong Film Awards ''Kung Fu Hustle,'' directed by Stephen Chow, right, and ''2046,'' by Wong Kar-wai, were the top winners at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards yesterday. ''Kung Fu Hustle,'' a Hollywood-financed picture about a kung fu master posing as a landlord, won best picture; the film, which was shown at Sundance this year, is to open in New York and Los Angeles on April 8. ''2046,'' about an illicit love affair, swept the acting awards, with Tony Leung (''Hero,'' ''Infernal Affairs'') and Zhang Ziyi (''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' ''Hero'') taking lead actor and actress prizes, The Associated Press reported. Between them, the two films won 12 awards at the ceremony, which also included tributes to Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Will Smith and Jon Voight announced a festival of Italian films for children in Los Angeles last week: the Giffoni Hollywood Film Festival, to run from April 28 through May 1 with more than 20 films geared toward children, The Associated Press reported. The festival's judges are to be between the ages of 9 and 17 and will come from the United States and 15 other countries. Footnote Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is to give a talk next month about Duccio di Buoninsegna's ''Madonna and Child,'' right, the tiny Renaissance painting that the Met bought last year for an estimated $45 million, the museum's most expensive purchase in its history. Mr. de Montebello has called the painting ''one of the greatest single acquisitions of the last half century'' and will discuss it on April 26 in a lecture entitled ''Museums: Why Should We Care?'' Keith Christiansen, a curator at the museum, will give another talk on May 3, ''Duccio, Giotto and the Origins of Western Painting.''"
