Gleaming white in the sun by day and the floodlights that bathed it all night, the cluster of rockets, space plane and giant egglike fuel tank looked like a craggy Matterhorn transposed to the humid coast. It was surely too big to ever move, and yet the fate of the nation seemed to depend on its doing so. Months earlier I had traveled with a group of science writers on a weeklong junket through the nation's space centers. In California, we walked underneath the next shuttle, Challenger, where Rockwell workers were gluing the fragile heat-resistant tiles to its body. At Cape Canaveral, our private jet touched down on the shuttle landing strip and we were taken within hailing distance of the waiting shuttle, close enough to see soldiers patrolling the launching pad with machine guns."

So why, on the 135th and final launching of the 30-year-old space shuttle program, will there be only four? The answer, perhaps not surprisingly, has to do with the Atlantis's being the last flight: With no spare shuttle available to go and rescue the astronauts in case something goes wrong, the Americans would have to turn to the Russians to retrieve their crew from the International Space Station. And the Russian spacecraft -- known as Soyuz capsules -- hold only three astronauts, so two people would have to fly up and bring home the Americans one at a time."

That was a half century ago, when men first squeezed into their machines and, defying gravity, rode into a new dimension of human experience. Unbound to Earth, our species could imagine that an age of spacefaring was truly under way, the Moon and Mars within reach, maybe even an asteroid where the Little Prince awaited our visit. The promised new reality legitimized fantasies."
