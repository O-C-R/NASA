Now and then, its occupants -- 6-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo), 10-year-old Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and their teenage sister, Lisa (Kristen Stewart) -- must fight against fierce gravitational forces pulling them toward the void."

Shu Qi, left, won best actress for her performance in ''Three Times,'' about three love affairs in three different eras; and Aaron Kwok, a pop singer from Hong Kong, won best actor in ''Divergence.'' At the 25th Golden Rooster Awards, held on Saturday on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, Jackie Chan won best actor for his portrayal of a disillusioned police officer in ''New Police Story.'' A low-budget film, ''You and Me,'' won for best actress (Jin Yaqin) and best director (Ma Liwen), and two movies, the war picture ''On the Mountain of Tai Hang'' and the Hollywood-backed ''Kekexili Mountain Patrol,'' shared the best film award. This year the Golden Roosters were opened up to actors from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in a bid to compete with the Golden Horse prizes. 'Girl Frenzy' in Minnesota At Mall Concert"

There is a slight possibility that the rock, 99942 Apophis, will hit Earth in 2036 after coming within about 20,000 miles in 2029.
