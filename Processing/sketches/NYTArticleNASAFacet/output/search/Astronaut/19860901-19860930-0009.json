Dr. James C. Fletcher, head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in an interview that a fleet of four orbiters would be unable to carry all the military, scientific, and space station payloads scheduled for launching in the early 1990's. ''With the space station on top of everything else, a fifth orbiter is an absolute necessity,'' he said. The decision to build a fifth space shuttle would have to be made in the next year or two, he added."

The record shows longstanding worry about seals on the shuttle and application of an innovative remedy to generations of booster rockets. It also shows why the solution was unavailable for the Challenger flight of Jan. 28, in which a leaky booster seal touched off an explosion that destroyed the craft and killed its seven astronauts. To critics, this new history suggests duplicity on the part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration: While publicly declaring the shuttle safe to fly, these critics say, NASA officials knew the flaw was grave and had quietly embarked on a major program to fix it. Denial From NASA NASA officials vigorously deny this charge, insisting they were unaware of the seriousness of the flaw and were simply trying to increase the booster's margin of safety."

      "lead_paragraph": "Since the nation's first manned space flight in 1961, engineers who design spacecraft have argued about margins of safety, weighing cost and time against risk to human life. But it was always a quiet debate, behind closed doors, and almost never framed in life-or-death terms. No longer. When the Challenger disintegrated in the clear Florida skies eight months ago today, it triggered changes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration never thought possible. The most immediate, one NASA official said with some bitterness the other day, is ''a loss of autonomy'' - with astronauts, Congress, some of the nation's leading scientists, the press and the public all questioning the agency's safety judgments."

      "lead_paragraph": "PRIDE, self-deception and institutional loyalty were some of the factors that aerospace experts say kept the space agency from sounding alarm bells years ago when it discovered the flaw that would cause the Challenger disaster and embarked on sweeping efforts to fix it. Former space agency officials and other outside experts, reacting to recent reports of the repair program, said such factors prompted the space agency to minimize the importance of the repairs and to carry them out slowly. The hubris was contagious, these experts add: Journalists too often limited their space agency coverage to the adventure of flight; members of Congress were cheerleaders instead of overseers, and the White House helped create an atmosphere in which other issues took a back seat to making the space shuttle pay for itself by carrying commercial payloads aloft. ''Blame should be equally distributed,'' said Alex Roland, who was a historian with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from 1973 to 1981. ''Everybody wanted to believe NASA was squeaky clean.''"
