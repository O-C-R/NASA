Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 13. Now Playing * ''ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER,'' starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Pedro Almodovar (R, 101 minutes; winner of best foreign-language film Oscar). A whole new order of Almodovar extravaganza. The antic fizz and theatrical exaggeration of his earlier work have blossomed into a newly sophisticated style, one that is far more wise and deeply felt. Lovingly dedicated to actresses who have played actresses, this film weaves its own soap opera around ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and tells of splendidly resilient women; Mr. Almodovar has aptly described his material as ''screwball drama.'' Rich and entertaining, this story celebrates the power of artifice and impersonation to transcend ordinary truth. The irrepressible Ms. San Juan, a Spanish nightclub performer, plays a transsexual named Agrado and is the film's biggest treat (Janet Maslin). * ''AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey (winner of best-actor Oscar), Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes; winner of best picture, director, cinematography and original-screenplay Oscars). With heavenly finesse, Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Maslin). * ''BEAU TRAVAIL,'' starring Denis Lavant and Gregoire Colin. Directed by Claire Denis (not rated, 90 minutes). A loose adaptation of ''Billy Budd,'' moved to the present and set in the East African enclave of Djibouti, Ms. Denis's finest film to date observes the day-to-day rituals of a troop of French Legionnaires training in a harshly beautiful wasteland. The visually spellbinding movie depicts their rigorous drills and rituals as ecstatic rites of purification and the embodiment of an impenetrable masculine mystique. In this version of the allegory, the Claggart figure, Sergeant Galoup (Mr. Lavant), is a disillusioned officer, and his prey (Mr. Colin) a soldier whose humanity offends the sergeant. Not to be missed (Stephen Holden). * ''BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hilary Swank (winner of best-actress Oscar) and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of last year's best (Maslin). * ''THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,'' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo and Michael Caine (winner of best suporting actor Oscar). Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes). Radically downsized in scope and its examination of the issue of abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with an Oscar-winning Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the world. Mr. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent brought up in an orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Mr. Caine), who performs abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms. Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940's ''David Copperfield'' (Holden). * ''THE COLOR OF PARADISE,'' starring Mohsen Ramezani and Hossein Mahjur. Directed by Majid Majidi (PG, 90 minutes). This beautiful Iranian movie about a widowed father who is reluctant to care for his blind 8-year-old son is a heartbreaker done with such conviction that it avoids mawkishness. When the special school the boy has been attending won't keep him on, the father takes his son first to the family's woodland homestead, then leaves him in the care of a blind carpenter. The movie evokes nature with an ecstatic sensuousness, and its heady soundtrack teems with the sounds of birds, insects, wind and rain (Holden). ''ERIN BROCKOVICH,'' starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 127 minutes). After a promising, effective beginning in which Ms. Roberts proves what a fine actress she can be and Mr. Soderbergh demonstrates yet again that he is one of the most thoughtful and original directors in Hollywood, ''Erin Brockovich'' becomes a doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice Hollywood melodrama, a smooth secondhand amalgam of ''Norma Rae'' and ''Silkwood,'' with vigorous nods to ''The Rainmaker'' and ''A Civil Action.'' Ms. Roberts, playing a working-class single mother who spearheads an effort to win justice for victims of corporate negligence, aggressively solicits an Oscar nomination. After acting for about 40 minutes, Ms. Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to bursting with moral vanity and phony populism. It's as if she had a clause in her contract strictly limiting anyone else's right to be attractive or appealing on screen. Who could have foreseen that Mr. Soderbergh, the most brilliantly unpredictable of filmmakers, could have made a movie so utterly hokey and conventional? (A. O. Scott). ''GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,'' starring Forest Whitaker. Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In his new film Mr. Jarmusch does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for the western in ''Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative, bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ''Ghost Dog'' is worth seeing for Mr. Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Mr. Jarmusch's offbeat sense of cinematic style and for the hip-hop artist the RZA's brilliant musical effects (Scott). * ''HIGH FIDELITY,'' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107 minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995 novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Mr. Cusack has one of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ''Top 5'' breakups in his disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden). ''MISSION TO MARS,'' starring Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins. Directed by Brian De Palma (PG, 113 minutes). This film's visual design is spectacular, and the scenes on the Martian surface look so real that the picture could have been made on location. But the movie is undermined by Mr. De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe. All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment for adults out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity on Mars. Mr. Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30 seconds. In space no one can hear you snore (Elvis Mitchell). ''THE NINTH GATE,'' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella. Directed by Roman Polanski (R, 133 minutes). For those with an interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' look no further. This film, with its wizened decadence and its tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name. Mr. Langella is Boris Balkan, a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired antiquities who hires Dean Corso (Mr. Depp), a weedy rogue book dealer, to locate a volume called ''The Nine Gates.'' Will Balkan get Satan's powers in his clutches through mastery of the book? Mr. Polanski is out to cross ''Rosemary's Baby'' with his saucy spoof ''The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ''The Blair Witch Project,'' and not nearly as funny (Mitchell). * ''NOT ONE LESS,'' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed by Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's new drama enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title), sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive power of Vittorio De Sica's ''Bicycle Thief'' (Scott). ''THE ROAD TO EL DORADO,'' with the voices of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh and Rosie Perez. Directed by Eric Bibo Bergeron and Don Paul (PG, 89 minutes). This animated buddy movie aspires to the airiness of a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby ''road'' romp but it's hopelessly bland even by those timid 1940's standards. Mr. Kline and Mr. Branagh provide the nearly interchangeable voices of two perky con men who foil Hernando Cortes's 1519 invasion of the mythical El Dorado. Though scenic and fast-paced, the main characters have no life, and the movie plays history false. Elton John and Tim Rice provided six clunky songs (Holden). ''WAKING THE DEAD,'' starring Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Keith Gordon (R, 106 minutes). Mr. Gordon's earnest screen adaptation of Scott Spencer's popular novel about a love that transcends death aspires to be a kind of intellectualized ''Love Story,'' set in the 1970's counterculture. But the blend of history and heartbreak doesn't quite jell. Mr. Crudup, as a rising Chicago politician, and Ms. Connelly, as his radical activist girlfriend who dies in a car bombing, have good chemistry. But the movie is so busy jumping back and forth between the past and present that it is continually stumbling over itself and breaking its own spell (Holden). * ''WINTER SLEEPERS,'' starring Ulrich Matthes, Marie-Lou Sellem, Floriane Daniel and Heino Ferch. Directed by Tom Tykwer (not rated, 124 minutes). Thrillingly virtuosic cinematic flourishes lend a steady charge of adrenaline to this drama about the tangled destinies of well-to-do German slackers in a picture-perfect skiing village. Made just before the jet-propelled pop fantasy ''Run Lola Run'' put Mr. Tykwer on the short list of major international filmmakers, ''Winter Sleepers'' conveys the spiritual malaise afflicting the generation in its late 20's and 30's. But like ''Run Lola Run,'' this movie is also about how human destiny has everything to do with split-second timing (Holden). Film Series ''FOR OPENERS: THE ART OF FILM TITLES.'' In the beginning are the titles. Blending image, sound, music and text, they enhance the experience of moviegoing by setting the mood and presenting the themes of a film. Today and tomorrow, the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Walter Reade Theater is presenting a tribute to movie title designers and their work in an event that includes two panels, two illustrated presentations and two programs of short films. At 6 tonight, predigital designers like Pablo Ferro (''Dr. Strangelove'') and Wayne Fitzgerald (''Bonnie and Clyde'') are to discuss their work, and at 8:15 the writer Ken Coupland and the designer David Peters are to show and discuss some 20 classic and rarely seen sequences from 1950 to 1980 by Saul Bass, Maurice Binder, Mr. Ferro, Robert Greenberg and others for directors like Stanley Donen, Blake Edwards, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Otto Preminger. At 6:15 p.m. tomorrow, a new generation of motion picture graphic designers like Randy Balsmeyer (''Magnolia'') and Deborah Ross (''The Talented Mr. Ripley'') are to discuss and show their work and at 8:15 Mr. Coupland and Mr. Peters are to discuss and show film titles from 1980 to the present. The tribute continues through tomorrow at the Walter Reade, at Lincoln Center. Admission: $9; $5 for Film Society members. Information: (212) 875-5600 (Lawrence Van Gelder)."

The novel's characters, who spoke a mellifluous Caribbean patois, did not have to travel to other worlds to confront strange life-forms; the spirits of West African religious tradition were all around them in a decaying near-future Toronto, intervening in their everyday lives for good or ill. Without offering any scientific explanation for the witchcraft she evoked, Hopkinson treated the spirit world with the same rigor and respect other writers bring to rocket science or molecular biology. Hopkinson's second novel, MIDNIGHT ROBBER (Aspect/Warner, paper, $13.95), succeeds on an even grander scale. When people hear voices on Toussaint -- a planet settled by colonists of Caribbean background -- they know it is the worldwide computer speaking through ''nanotech'' interfaces embedded in everyone's brain. Tan-Tan, the young daughter of Mayor Antonio of Cockpit County, lives a pampered life, surrounded by high-tech toys and doting servants. But the breakdown of her parents' marriage leads to violence, and Tan-Tan ends up with her father on the prison world New Half-Way Tree."
