''Lost our Lease!'' and ''Everything 60% Off!'' is written in giant letters in almost every window. The dying wails of the antique shop overpower its new neighbor, which is kind of remarkable considering that BBC/Ice Cream, which opened in late November, offers top-end hip-hop garb that is anything but subtle. For instance, upon entering the heavy glass doors and nodding hello to the stern and suited doorman, you see on your right an $880 denim jacket with a shimmering image of an ice cream bar in Swarovski crystals on the back. It has eyeballs, and it is melting in blue drips. I spent a philosophical moment here, comparing a turn-of-the-century metal statue of a filigreed fairy in the antique store with this jacket, trying to decide which was more frivolous, and I concluded that life was totally meaningless."

But in the case of the Honeycomb Vase, it's 40,000 -- because the ''workers'' who made it were bees toiling in their hive. The vase was conceived by Tomás Gabzdil Libertiny, a young Slovakian product designer. Eager to explore the relationship between design and nature, he settled upon beeswax as a suitable material and chose the vase as an appropriate object to make from it. ''Beeswax comes from flowers and, in the form of a vase, it ends up containing flowers before they die,'' Libertiny says. ''It's a beautiful story.''"
