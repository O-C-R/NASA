Mr. Affenito is the first of Playboy's male bunnies, to be called rabbits, for the new Playboy Empire Club opening in New York. The club is to be a prototype, with Playboy planning to have the rabbits multiply like crazy in clubs all over the country. ''I always wanted to be first,'' said Mr. Affenito, a tall, dark carpenter and aspiring actor. ''I came to realize that I would not be the first astronaut or the first to hit 62 home runs. This is an honor.''"

Proponents of an expanded role for the Defense Department say the United States needs to counter a growing Soviet threat in space. They say the Soviet Union conducts four to five times as many space launching a year as the United States, with the vast majority of missions devoted to military objectives. Soviet military officers have, all together, logged years in space, they say, while the American military has logged days. Secrecy is essential, they add, to the success of the Defense Department's space activities."

Cooper: What Really Happened,'' by Max Gunther (Contemporary Books, Chicago, $14.95). This book, described as ''the incredible true story of the hijacking, escape and years of hiding,'' brings the steadily expanding legend close to home with Mr. Gunther's surprising disclosures about the ''shy, middle-aged'' passenger who threatened to blow up the plane unless he got $200,000 and four parachutes. Up to now, Mr. Gunther writes, the ''tiny town'' of Ariel, Wash., in the region ''where the pirate had apparently landed,'' has ''adopted D.B. Cooper as its own and still holds annual celebrations in his honor.'' But like the classic mystery story, the facts, we are told, are vastly different. Among other things, they involve a sympathetic woman (here named Clara) who, a decade after she had befriended Mr. Cooper, decided to talk to Mr. Gunther."

The four-day mission, operated under strict secrecy rules imposed by the Department of Defense, ended with military precision. The shuttle touched down just after 10 A.M. At the moment it came to a full stop, at 10:01 and 14 seconds, a recording of ''The Star Spangled Banner'' began playing over loud speakers that are usually dominated by communications with the astronauts. Fewer than a dozen reporters and about two dozen employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration were on hand for the landing, an event that usually draws hundreds of spectators. The military had given just 24 hours' notice of when the secret mission was to end and had barred members of the public from watching."

He fears he may be shut out next time by the remaining 12 in a collection of subjects he chose as children in London. His frank and revealing films of their lives at ages 7, 14, 21 and 28 have appeared so often on British television that people in pubs gossip about ''Suzi, the posh girl,'' ''Tony, the tear-away jockey boy'' and the others, as though they were characters in a soap opera. The 44-year-old British director, best known in this country for ''Coal Miner's Daughter,'' says he is not sure how subjects see him. ''To them, I'm probably some exotic bird who lives in Hollywood and makes movies and flies in every seven years to catch up on their lives,'' he was saying the other day at breakfast in a midtown hotel."

Neatly printed black letters on white spelled a puzzling message for a young black boy from suburban St. Louis traveling with his parents through sleepy Arkansas towns with the rural charm of Norman Rockwell paintings. The sign read: ''Whites Only.'' When the boy asked about it, his mother answered resignedly, ''It means we can't stay there, son.'' Nearly 30 years have passed since I saw that sign and pondered its message. I have grown and prospered because my father, a postal employee, and my mother, a public-school teacher, sent me, like Moses through the bulrushes, to the shores of new opportunity created by the civil-rights movement. I was one of two blacks to integrate a suburban elementary school in 1958. Later, a white ninth-grade English teacher encouraged me to become a journalist because she saw a spark of writing talent."
