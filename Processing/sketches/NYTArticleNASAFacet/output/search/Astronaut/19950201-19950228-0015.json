Their tense meeting was the first significant step in a multibillion-dollar venture to turn former foes into partners in the biggest collaborative science project ever. With nine astronauts chattering away in English and Russian, six on the Discovery and three on Mir, the 122-foot-long shuttle slowly came within about 40 feet of the 108-foot Russian outpost at 2:20 P.M. and held that position for a few minutes in a rehearsal for the first shuttle-station linkup, scheduled for June."

Col. Eileen Collins, at the helm of the shuttle Discovery, became the first woman to pilot an American spaceship. In 1960 and 1961, 26 female pilots underwent the same rigorous training as the Mercury astronaut candidates. Thirteen passed the preliminary tests. But the so-called Fellow Lady Astronaut Trainees program was canceled. Why train females, NASA reasoned, when they lacked test-pilot training (then forbidden to women) and there were already more than enough men to fill the available slots? It may be, too, that the NASA official who is reported to have said he would \"just as soon orbit a bunch of monkeys than a bunch of women\" was not alone in his thinking."

Forty-eight percent of the households in Manhattan consist of people living alone, a figure twice the national average and exceeded only by that other island, Molokai. Many of these single people are here only briefly -- they find a partner and flee to the suburbs -- but many remain alone. In Manhattan nearly one fifth of the women over 45 have never married, the highest ratio of any American county."
