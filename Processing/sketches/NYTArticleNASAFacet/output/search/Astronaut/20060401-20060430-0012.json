      "lead_paragraph": "THE Space Coast -- a roughly 72-mile stretch of Florida that runs along the Atlantic Ocean from Melbourne to Titusville -- has 321 for its area code. For good reason: this is a place where countdowns really count, the home of the John F. Kennedy Space Center. And though NASA's recent record has been a checkered one, there's excitement along the coast once again, with a new shuttle launch scheduled for this summer. But beyond the space program's otherworldly appeal, the region has much to offer, from unspoiled beaches to one of the country's best surf shops. Feeling hungry? You can dine on fine French cuisine or fresh Florida seafood -- or just head to a local souvenir shop for some freeze-dried ice cream, an astronaut favorite. CHARLES PASSY Friday 6 p.m. 1 -- Ocean Outreach The Space Coast's lovably scruffy side reveals itself at the Cocoa Beach Pier (401 Meade Avenue, Cocoa Beach; 321-783-7549), a 44-year-old hangout that stretches some 800 feet into the Atlantic Ocean. You come here to drink, dine or fish -- the pier is dotted with stores, bars and restaurants, both indoors and outdoors -- or just take in the expansive view. The pier scene really hops during the Friday-night ''Boardwalk Bash,'' when bands perform. Enjoy a cold one and some bar fare (wings, burgers, fish and chips) at the Marlins Good Times Bar and Grill while listening to the music. 8 p.m. 2 -- Hang 10, 24/7 Who doesn't feel the need to go surfboard shopping on a Friday night? O.K., so maybe you're not ready to plunk down up to $900 to ride the waves in style, but the selections at the justly famous Ron Jon Surf Shop (4151 North Atlantic Avenue, Cocoa Beach; 321-799-8888) go beyond boards and surfing gear. The two-story, 52,000-square-foot store, which is open 24 hours a day -- and claims to be visited by more than 2 million people annually -- also sells beachwear, shot glasses, Polynesian kitsch and other ''why did I buy that?'' items. A spirit of endless hooky pervades, as evidenced by the T-shirt for sale that says, ''I was on summer vacation for 20 years.'' Saturday 8 a.m. 3 -- Breakfast Cubano While Cuban food is most associated with the Miami area, the Space Coast can lay claim to one of the state's best spots -- Roberto's Little Havana Restaurant (26 North Orlando Avenue, Cocoa Beach; 321-784-1868). It's a downtown Cocoa Beach favorite serving all the Cuban classics, from palomilla steak to fried yuca to flan. But at breakfast time, it's the place to be for an egg-bacon-cheese sandwich ($4.95), served on soft Cuban bread. Good Cuban coffee, too. 9:30 a.m. 4 -- Citrus Stop You're in Florida, so you'll have to stop for some liquid sunshine -- a k a orange juice. Policicchio Groves (5780 North Courtenay Parkway, Merritt Island; 321-452-4866; closed some weekends in summer, call ahead for hours) fills the bill on the Space Coast. This 85-year-old enterprise, run by Carolina Policicchio (below), has an assortment of oranges and grapefruits; the varieties change each month during the winter and the spring-to-early-summer growing seasons. Everything is freshly picked; the groves are across the road. 10:30 a.m. 5 -- A Space Odyssey The John F. Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (Route 405, Titusville; 321-449-4444; admission $31, $21 for children ages 3 to 11) may vaguely resemble one of Florida's many theme parks at first, but very soon it becomes much more inspiring. Start with a walk through the Rocket Garden, an open-air space that features awe-inspiring Redstone, Atlas and Titan rockets that date from the days of the Mercury and Gemini missions; you can also squeeze into replicas of the capsules the astronauts used. But that's the appetizer to the space center's main course -- a roughly three-hour bus tour that gives you a sense of how big the center truly is (some 140,000 acres, including the surrounding wildlife refuge). The tour stops at such key sites as the International Space Station Center and the 60-foot LC 39 Observation Gantry. Along the way, you'll pass the Vehicle Assembly Building -- a structure so cavernous, clouds are said to have formed inside it. The tour's most jaw-dropping stop is the Apollo/Saturn V Center, a huge hangar that contains an actual Saturn V rocket. Take time to look at the individual exhibits about the Apollo program, all presented with extraordinary detail. 2:45 p.m. 6 -- Close Encounter Now that you've gotten yourself acquainted (or reacquainted) with the space program, it's time to meet a real astronaut. The center's Astronaut Encounter affords an opportunity to do just that. Veterans of the space program, mostly from the shuttle era, give daily 30-minute presentations about their experiences and field questions from the audience. (There are at least three presentations daily, with one generally at mid-afternoon.) Want a little more face time? For an extra $22.99 ($15.99 for children), you can sign up for Lunch With an Astronaut, which takes place daily at 12:15 p.m. Among those who have participated in both the encounter and lunch programs are the Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden and the six-time shuttle veteran Story Musgrave. 3:30 p.m. 7 -- Astronaut Memorial Twenty-four astronauts have died in their attempts to slip ''the surly bonds of earth,'' as the World War II pilot John Gillespie Magee Jr. put it in a poem quoted by President Reagan after the 1986 Challenger disaster. Those men and women are remembered at the center's simple, stark Space Mirror Memorial -- a black granite surface in which the 24 names are inscribed. When the light is at the right angle, the names seem to float in space. 7 p.m. 8 -- Au Côte d'Espace The Space Coast may not be a citadel of fine dining, but Café Margaux (220 Brevard Avenue, Cocoa; 321-639-8343) is an exception to the rule. This quaint restaurant, set in the tree-lined Cocoa Village district, is proudly French, with a few nods elsewhere. Start off with the hearty country-style duck pâté ($9.95) or a zesty curried Caesar salad ($4.95). Entrees include a pleasing mélange of seafood prepared three ways ($22.95) and a stick-to-your-ribs veal chop over risotto ($28.95). The wine list places equal emphasis on New and Old World vintages. Sunday 10 a.m. 9 -- Natural Habitat It takes a lot of surrounding land to keep the Kennedy Space Center's launch sites properly isolated. Much of that acreage is encompassed within the buffer zone that is the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (321-861-0667; admission is free) -- a huge, mostly untouched tract that is home to migratory birds in the winter and has more than a dozen active bald eagle nests. Begin your journey by picking up a map at one of the kiosks near the entrances to the refuge (the small visitor's center is closed Sundays from April to October), then head to the gloriously remote beaches, which are part of the separately managed Canaveral National Seashore (321-267-1110; admission $3). Conclude with a visit to the refuge's Black Point Wildlife Drive -- a seven-mile loop that allows you to get close to wildlife, including alligators and egrets, without leaving your car. 1 p.m. 10 -- In the Realm of the Shrimp The family-owned Dixie Crossroads Seafood Restaurant (1475 Garden Street, Titusville; 321-268-5000) is mostly about shrimp. It has its own fleet of about 10 full-time commercial shrimpers, which provide the restaurant with its lobsterlike rock shrimp and more firmly textured Royal Red shrimp, among other Florida varieties. (Once you try these, you'll find it hard to go back to garden-variety frozen shrimp.) The shrimp can be had broiled, fried or steamed; prices range from $10.49 to $31.99, depending on variety and number of shrimp. But before you dig in, you'll get to enjoy the corn fritters starters included with every meal. The bustling setting is also a hoot -- part Old Florida (wildlife murals and a fish pond), part pure kitsch. You can pose outside with Mr. and Mrs. Rock -- cartoonish statues of a rock shrimp ''family.'' Surfing the Stars Or the Atlantic The Space Coast is about an hour's drive east of Orlando. Melbourne International Airport is the closest major airport; Delta Air Lines offers several flights a day. A car is a must to explore the area. One of the newest hotels in the area also happens to be one of the best -- the surf-themed, family-friendly Ron Jon Cape Caribe Resort (1000 Shorewood Drive, Cape Canaveral; 888-933-3030; www.ronjonresort.com), which is on the ocean and convenient to busy Port Canaveral, a departure point for several cruise lines. Among its many amenities are a ''lazy river'' and a pool, both heated, and a miniature golf course. The resort is a time-share that also rents its rooms, which range from studios to three-bedroom suites; rates start at $130 a night. More intimate is Casa Coquina, a bed-and-breakfast in Titusville (4010 Coquina Avenue, 877-684-8341; www.casacoquina.com). Its seven suites all have sitting rooms and private baths. Rates are $79 to $139."

(Fox) THE O.C. -- Beautiful, troubled young Californians go to freshman orientation at their prestigious future college homes, Brown and the University of California at Berkeley. Next week: senior prom. 10 P.M. (CBS) WITHOUT A TRACE -- A young man from a wealthy old family does volunteer work at a homeless shelter after being convicted of drug possession. Then he disappears. Maybe he was kidnapped. Or maybe a shelter isn't the ideal place to get away from drug users. Perry King and Gina Torres guest-star as his parents. 10 P.M. (ABC) COMMANDER IN CHIEF -- Adam Arkin (right) guest-stars as a nominee for attorney general, going through confirmation difficulties. A plane full of military weapons goes missing. And so does Kate (Polly Bergen), the president's mother. ANITA GATES"

He was 84. Mr. Crossfield, who lived in Herndon, Va., just outside Washington, was on a flight from Prattville, Ala., to Manassas, Va., when his single-engine craft when down, the Civil Air Patrol said Thursday. There were thunderstorms in the region at the time. Mr. Crossfield was in good health and good spirits before making the flight, his son-in-law Ed Fleming said Thursday in a telephone interview."

Rather, in what must have been a divinely timed coincidence, I wrapped ''The Da Vinci Code'' on the same day Dan Striepeke, my makeup man for 19 years, turned 75."
