More teachers than ever are using television and videotapes in class. But videos for the classroom bear little resemblance to the cartoons and sitcoms that children watch at home, says Sarah Feldman, project director for the National Teacher Training Institute for Science, Television and Technology."

So the four-term Ohio Senator and former astronaut has found himself on what might be called a retrospective fund-raising party trail in hopes of erasing those debts. He is coming to New York for a party on Monday at the studio of the artist PETER MAX, on West 65th Street. Vice President Al Gore has said he will attend, and the organizers hope it will raise $400,000. With Federal election laws barring any candidate from contributing more than $50,000 to his own campaign and limiting gifts from individuals to $1,000, the Senator has found it difficult to raise new money for the old debt. Mr. Glenn said he was not legally liable for the debt, since it was incurred in the name of his campaign committee. \"What do you do, walk away and say it's not my responsibility?\" he said. \"I couldn't do that.\""

Lying at the bottom of the tank like a sunken pirate ship is the cargo bay of a space shuttle, chockablock with high-tech fittings, boxes, handholds, airlock and a 30-foot white robot arm draped with cables. Nearby, standing upright on the pool bottom, is a sizable section of the Hubble Space Telescope -- not the real one, of course, which has drifted in famous myopia 370 miles above the earth these last three years, but a full-scale model. Kathy Thornton and Tom Akers, dressed in bulbous spacesuits, float through the landscape like marine Robocops, trailing hoses, bubbles and a bevy of frogman assistants. Prowling the edge of the pool is 58-year-old Story Musgrave: surgeon, parachutist, gardener, ex-marine, literary critic, holder of six university degrees, father of five children, veteran astronaut and bald as a monk. On Wednesday, Musgrave will make his fifth trip into space, accompanied by Akers, Thornton and four other astronauts, aboard a space shuttle Endeavour crammed with tools and instruments. Their mission: repair the orbiting Hubble telescope, which suffers not only blurry vision but also several potentially fatal mechanical ailments. Practice, Musgrave hopes, will make perfect. By early October, he and his crew have spent nearly 400 hours in tanks like the one in Huntsville, rehearsing every conceivable excruciating moment of Hubble's rebirth."
