Paper, $3.95 IN one of Isak Dinesen's stories, a Danish nobleman sits thinking about roses. A rose isn't a rose, he reflects - at least, not in art. Depending on where and when the painter lived, it inevitably becomes a Chinese or a Dutch, a rococco or an Empire rose - and something he personally can date within 20 years and place within 500 miles. He then reflects how curious it is that he can do this, since the artist had not set out to express time or place; he had just aimed to paint a flower."

As it rises on its multiple tails of fire, a slight, 5-foot-5-inch, 115-pound figure will be seated just behind the pilot and co-pilot, acting as flight engineer, helping to monitor the glowing cockpit lights and gauges that tell whether all is well. That will be history. For the flight engineer will be Sally K. Ride, the first American woman to fly in space. She laughed with obvious appreciation the other day when someone suggested that she is about to become the subject of a trivia question forever. But in a more serious moment, reflecting on the fact that she has now become a premier role model for millions of girls and young women, she says there is no doubt in her mind about what has cleared the way for her to take that seat in Challenger's cockpit next April. It is the women's movement."

They have lost most of their life-saving equipment in a snowslide and they are miles away from potential rescue. It looks as if they will perish before the sun sets. So what do they do? At the top of his voice, one of them yells, ''Helllp!'', and they both laugh helplessly. One of the most emboldening aspects of Patrick Meyers's ''K2'' at the Arena Stage is its knowledge of its own absurdity. What are those two men - one a district attorney, the other a nuclear physicist - doing so near to the top of the world? In the course of a dramatic cliffhanger, we learn that even they aren't sure of their reasons: they know they have climbed the mountain because they are there."

Public art blossomed in the 19th century, with its rage for battle monuments and statues of heroes on horseback. Another surge came in the 1930's and 40's, when - as Depression aid - the Treasury Department and the Works Progress Administration gave to hundreds of artists commissions for public buildings. But there has probably never been such a proliferation of art for public sites as in the last two decades. Spurred by grants from the Federal Government, local ordinances that give a percentage of public building costs to art, commissions from image-building corporations, and the belief by business and civic leaders that art will enhance the ''quality of life'' in their communities, an invasion of monumental proportions has spread throughout the country. And in many areas, including New York, it is causing intense debate. Selected for the most part by art professionals, but not always loved by those who have to live with them, the new public icons adorn buildings, plazas, parks, malls, meadows, subway stations, electronic billboards -even rivers and city dumps. Their raison d'etre is the notion that art benefits the community, but unlike the old-style commemorative works, they tend to be abstract, and to celebrate the creative process of a particular artist, rather than a person or event."

As the Senate worked on the budget for the fiscal year 1983, a preliminary review Thursday of disclosure reports from 95 of the Senate's 100 members indicated that the chamber's club of millionaires, as many as 41 in past years, had probably lost no members. As in the House, members took advantage of new rules removing limits on the amount they could collect in speaking fees. The House doubled its limit to about $18,000, but the Senate lifted its $25,000 ceiling altogether."

(Avon/Bard, $3.95.) In this sequel to his classic, ''Epitaph of a Small Winner'' (Avon/Bard, $2.25), the Brazilian novelist Machado de Assis (1839-1908) chronicled the fortunes of a provincial schoolteacher who, after inheriting a fortune on condition that he take care of his benefactor's dog, moves into a Rio de Janeiro mansion and a world of new experiences, among them insanity. The introduction by the translator, Clotilde Wilson, will help North American readers appreciate the irony and other forms of literary caviar that were Machado's specialty."

Bartlett Giamatti, assailed President Reagan's proposed constitutional amendment to allow voluntary prayers in public schools as part of ''a politicizing of the schools for radical goals, cloaked in the rhetoric of morality and equity,'' ''I do not believe it is the Government's obligation, and it should not become it, to encourage through the Constitution in the public schools organized religious expression,'' Mr. Giamatti said, Mr. Giamatti's attack on ''certain moral politicians'' - he did not identify any - came at the end of an academic year that began with his attack on the Moral Majority for propounding ''dangerous, malicious nonsense.'' Those remarks, intended for a speech to incoming freshmen, were released in September while Mr. Giamatti was in the hospital."
