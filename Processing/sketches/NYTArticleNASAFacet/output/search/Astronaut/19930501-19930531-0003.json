The answer has to do with the chemical and physical properties of fibers from natural sources, especially cotton, wool and linen, said Dr. Ann Lemley, associate professor in the department of textiles and apparel at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. The individual fibers in yarns are made of long polymer chains, or strands of giant molecules, according to Dr. Lemley, who is a chemist. In their natural state, the chains are scrolled up or crinkled. In preparing them for spinning and weaving, the first step is usually a straightening of the fibers by processes like carding wool."
