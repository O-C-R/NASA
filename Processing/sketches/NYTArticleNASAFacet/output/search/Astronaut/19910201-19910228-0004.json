The astronauts, who were assigned a year and a half ago to a -Spacelab scientific research mission scheduled for September 1992, were married about a month ago. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is reviewing their assignment. \"We have other husband-and-wife astronauts but have never assigned a married couple to the same crew,\" BARBARA SCHWARTZ, a NASA spokeswoman, said yesterday. Mr. Lee, 38, is an an Air Force lieutenant colonel who made his first shuttle flight in 1989. He is to serve as payload commander for the joint Japanese-American mission aboard the new shuttle Endeavor.It would be the first shuttle flight for Dr. Davis, 37, an engineer who became an astronaut two and a half years ago."

While they are brightening the prospects for makers of unmanned rockets, the evolving changes are clouding the future for building space shuttles and forcing a scaling back of other programs like a space station. After years of confusion about the nation's space policies, industry executives are increasingly heartened by what they see as a more coherent and realistic approach by the Administration and Congress to designing and financing space projects."
