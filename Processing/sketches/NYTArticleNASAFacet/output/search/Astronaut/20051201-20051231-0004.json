An aspiring actress is given a role on NBC's daytime soap ''Passions.'' A future astronaut is sent to space camp. Kiyaan Vazirzadeh, a 10-year-old who wants to run Microsoft when he grows up, gets to try out the job for a day and meet the company's founder -- his idol, Bill Gates (above right, with Kiyaan and Amy Grant, the show's host) -- in the process. 7 P.M. (Hallmark) CELEBRATE! CHRISTMAS WITH MAYA ANGELOU -- Ms. Angelou, the novelist and poet, invites viewers into her North Carolina home. She also invites about 200 friends and relatives. 8 P.M. (Hallmark) C. S. LEWIS: BEYOND NARNIA -- The fantasy movie ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' opens today. Those who don't rush out to the theater may be interested in the life of Lewis (Anton Rodgers), the deeply religious British scholar who wrote the Narnia books. Until now, Lewis was best known to moviegoers as the man Anthony Hopkins played, opposite Debra Winger, in ''Shadowlands.'' 9 P.M. (A&E) BIOGRAPHY: ANGELINA JOLIE -- Ms. Jolie (right) is an Oscar winner (''Girl, Interrupted''), a goodwill ambassador (for the United Nations) and, at 30, the villain in the most scandalous Hollywood home-wrecking triangle since Elizabeth Taylor, Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher in the 1950's. And Brad Pitt is adopting her children. 9 P.M. (ABC) HOPE & FAITH -- Faith (Kelly Ripa) spends far too much on Christmas gifts this year. But she gives her brother-in-law (Ted McGinley) a fake gold watch. 9:30 P.M. (Fox) MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE -- Hal and Lois (Bryan Cranston and Jane Kaczmarek) have nothing to spend on Christmas gifts this year. So they decree that all presents have to be homemade. 2 A.M. (TCM) NEVER ON SUNDAY (1960). Melina Mercouri stars as the original happy hooker, a self-possessed prostitute making her own rules in a Greek port city. But an American (the Connecticut-born Jules Dassin, left, who also wrote and directed, with Mercouri) tries to reform her. Mercouri was named best actress (tying with Jeanne Moreau) at the Cannes Film Festival. Manos Hadjidakis's title song took home an Oscar. ANITA GATES"
