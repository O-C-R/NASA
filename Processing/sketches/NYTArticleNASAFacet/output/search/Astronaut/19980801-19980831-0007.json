In fine condition, the 72-inch-tall carved wood and sheet-metal sculpture depicts Uncle Sam sawing a log resting on a sawbuck. Standing beneath a flagpole, Stars and Stripes flapping away, this Uncle Sam is quite the dandy. He has long, wavy blond hair and wears bold red-and-white striped pants, a long blue tail coat and a white top hat with a star-studded blue hatband. He braces his foot on a log meticulously painted to show individual rings of growth. The log moves back and forth as the wind hits an elaborate mechanism underneath, a carousel of wind paddles. Commenting on its complex design, Stephen Fletcher, the head of Skinner's Americana department, said, ''It must have been made by an engineer-savant.''"
