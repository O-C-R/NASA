Today, when the mindless star-studded ''event movie'' has risen to become the economic cornerstone of the film industry, the time is more than ripe for an upstart video artist to concoct a similar fantasy that might be dubbed, ''Video Killed the Movie Star.'' In the world of the $20-million-a-picture movie-star salary, that's not going to happen any time soon. But as suggested by the work shown in the New York Video Festival, which opens today at the Walter Reade Theater, video art, that unruly stepchild of television and experimental cinema, has flowered into a vast, immensely creative alternative culture. At its most inventive, as in ''Flat Is Beautiful,'' Sadie Benning's 50-minute video evocation of preadolescent angst in a nontraditional Midwest household, experimental form and conventional narrative fuse into something extraordinarily original and touching."

Inside the two-bedroom bungalow, her husband lay bleeding from a self-inflicted knife wound. The confrontation began just after 6 P.M., when police officers knocked on the door at 440 Locust Avenue to serve a 15-year-old warrant for the arrest of Bob Higgins, also known as Bob Jones. The man opened the door a crack, but after a brief exchange with the cops, he slammed it shut, ran to the rear of the house and reappeared, holding two knives to his throat. ''Don't come in,'' he screamed. ''I'll kill myself if you come in here.''"

MARVIN MINSKY, 71, a rumpled-looking man who wears shirts mended with masking tape, is Toshiba professor of media arts and sciences and professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and one of the world's leading theorists of artificial intelligence. In the late 1950's, Dr. Minsky and John McCarthy, a professor of computer science at Stanford University, founded a research program that would evolve into the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. In addition to inventing and building thinking machines, Dr. Minsky wrote the classic ''The Society of Mind,'' (Simon & Schuster, 1986) in which he tries to show how intelligence works ''by the particular way the agents in the brain have evolved to interact.'' ''The Turing Option,'' (Warner Books, 1992) a novel by Dr. Minsky and Harry Harrison, is about superintelligence in not-too-far-off 2023."
