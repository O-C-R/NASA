The astronauts contended with a stuck cable that delayed release of the satellite on Tuesday. Their reel mechanism had stalled and the line became badly snarled. Four times over two days they tried to reel out the line to its full extent, but the satellite never went farther than 845 feet above the shuttle. Hopelessly Stuck for Hours For a few frustrating hours yesterday the tether, only one-tenth of an inch thick, appeared to be stuck hopelessly. The astronauts could neither reel it out beyond 750 feet nor reel it in."
