Among the more than 40 floats is a homage to Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, shown speeding across a New Mexico landscape designed from more than 50,000 roses; an animal safari in the savanna created out of black lichen, ming, fino and Spanish mosses, safflower blossoms, cordon puffs, coconut flakes, chive, onion seed and more than 25,000 yellow giant Oncidium orchids; a salute to epic moviemaking featuring walls, pillars and urns made from yellow, gold and bronze strawflower petals; and an ''Alice in Wonderland'' tea party fantasy good enough to eat, with white sweet rice, orange lentil, green split peas, red pyracanthus berries, safflower spice, walnut shells, cornmeal, paprika and green parsley flakes. 1 P.M. (HGTV) DEAR GENEVIEVE Genevieve Gorder offers advice to those who have fallen out of love with their homes in this new series, for which viewers upload images of their dwellings and descriptions of their design problems on hgtv.com. Her first challenge: to help a family find order in a great room through functional design and something she calls zoning."

His party did not want him as its standard bearer and put him on the ballot only when its nominee died in a plane crash. But by the time Senator John W. Warner of Virginia finished packing his office on Friday to close out 30 years in the job, he had built a reputation as a mainstay of the Capitol, regarded for his independence, integrity and national security expertise. No longer Elizabeth Taylor's sixth husband, Mr. Warner at the end has completed his journey from ridicule to respect."

Before her death on Dec. 18, Ms. Roddenberry made arrangements with the company Celestis Inc. to have her cremated remains sent into space in a container with a portion of Mr. Roddenberry's ashes. Celestis launched some of the remains of Mr. Roddenberry, who died in 1991, into orbit in 1997. A rocket payload carrying the remains of the \"Star Trek\" actor James Doohan and the astronaut Gordon Cooper on a flight offered by Celestis fell back to earth in 2007, and a second rocket carrying their remains failed to reach orbit in 2008. No date was announced for the launch of the Roddenberrys' ashes."
