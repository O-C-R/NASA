His portrait of Mr. Bush depicts the president with an elbow resting on a globe to represent his interest in foreign policy. ''I'm inclined to think it's pretty darn good,'' Mr. Bush said at the time."

Mr. Clooney tries too hard to find metaphors for Mr. Barris's trajectory from victory to emptiness, but, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, this is ''a ''good piece of work more often than not.'' 2002.

Written and recorded shortly after last year's marathon five-borough mini-tour of New York City, ''Reality'' is more than a bit thrusty. The rush of drums and electric guitar that opens the 10th and title track alone is such an adrenaline shot to the heart that the song makes you feel that Mr. Bowie and his spectacularly hard-rocking band might be about to materialize in your living room ready for an encore. The record is also -- perhaps because of that tour, perhaps simply because Mr. Bowie is a longtime resident of lower Manhattan -- more than a bit New Yorky. Among the many references to the city's contemporary landscape are the opening lyrics to the first track, ''New Killer Star'': ''See a great white scar/ Over Battery Park/ Then a flare glides over/ But I won't look at that scar.'' At least for New Yorkers, and quite possibly for everyone, the record's underground urban power, its search for order amid chaos and rubble give it a distinctly post-9/11 feel. Mr. Bowie is not a political artist, and the record is not a political statement. In fact, ''New Killer Star'' itself is not about Sept. 11, per se, any more than ''Heroes'' is about heroes, if only because the songwriting of the elusive and allusive Mr. Bowie is rarely that straightforward. But like much of Mr. Bowie's music, ''Reality'' is keenly attuned to the present."

Participants are taken through astronaut training procedures and assigned a role: commander, pilot, navigator or engineer. Children can explore an interactive crawl space in Space Base, and in the video game Expedition: Mars, participants explore the planet's surface.

We've done robotic operations on all those missions. The robonaut behind me is a highly dexterous, anthropomorphic robot. The robonaut can supplement or even take over some of the tasks that human crew members currently do on a spacewalk. They are tele-operated, which means that you have a human operator who's given equipment that essentially allows him to step into the body of the robonaut. What I've found working with the robonauts is that I look at it and think, Well, that's Mike or that's Fred. They become 'human' to me very quickly. Many times you hear there's a debate at NASA between unmanned and manned missions. But I think a human-robot spacewalking team is the future of NASA.'' interview by Catherine Saint Louis"

A White Stripes song bashes out of speakers wired to his iPod. Arrayed on the table in front of him are a bottle of Gatorade, a paperback copy of the Dalai Lama's ''Path to Tranquility'' and a magazine about trucks. It's 2 in the afternoon, the time that Black is usually just getting out of bed. ''I'm nocturnal by nature, like a vampire,'' he says. ''Two to 6 a.m. -- those are my best hours.'' The actor is here to make a music video for a song from his new movie, ''The School of Rock,'' and he needs to ramp up his energy level considerably for the comedic exertions today's shoot involves: leaping down stairs three at a time with arms flapping, hurling himself ''Dukes of Hazzard''-style over the hood of a car and erupting with all manner of crazed gesticulations and demonic grimaces. Stacked on the floor of the trailer are 200 posters for ''The School of Rock'' showing Black surrounded by a multiracial group of kids, holding a guitar and striking a lip-snarling pose. A sort of heavy-metal version of ''The Bad News Bears,'' the movie, which is set to open Oct. 3, stars Black as a slovenly would-be rock idol who bluffs his way into a job as a substitute teacher at an elite private school and recruits a class of high-achieving fifth graders to be in his band. He has just autographed each poster neatly with a black marker. ''I don't know who they're for,'' he says, ''but I've been assured every one I sign means 12 people who will see the movie.''"

T. A. Hoffmann ballet classic. The video and DVD have sold 3.5 million copies."
