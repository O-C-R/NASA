But that is the sizable - and some say hopeless - task that now confronts the marketing team for Tylenol, the nonprescription drug that was the nation's biggest-selling over-the-counter pain reliever. Indeed, Tylenol's past marketing efforts have been so successful that it commanded a market share estimated at 37 percent. But now, of course, the drug's image has been devastated by the tracing of seven deaths to cyanide-laced Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules. The deaths touched off a nationwide recall of capsule forms of the drug by its manufacturer, McNeil Consumer Products, a division of Johnson & Johnson."

Werner Herzog asked rhetorically about ''Fitzcarraldo,'' the film that closed this year's New York Film Festival to critical acclaim and that opened yesterday at the Paris Theater. One thing is certain - the ''dirt and mud'' is in this case memorable in its own right. Even for a director of extraordinary persistence, which Mr. Herzog has shown in the making of ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God,'' ''The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser'' and other films, ''Fitzcarraldo'' represents a victory of mind over some enormously unwieldy matter. ''I would have done 'Fitzcarraldo' in Central Park if I had had jungle there, and a mountain high enough, and two rivers,'' insisted the 40-year-old German director in a recent interview. ''I would have loved to direct it from a suite on Central Park South.'' Nonetheless, he journeyed to two remote sites along the Amazon, endured delays and the loss of his stars Jason Robards and Mick Jagger, and finally spent four and a half years and $6 million to see his dream realized."

Is this course truly inevitable, given the nature of man and international rivalries? Will it reduce the risk of war or merely lead to another, more costly phase of the arms race and turn man's newest frontier into a potential battleground? Many military planners and their political allies, reciting maxims of seapower, airpower and the foot soldier's ''high ground,'' tend to take for granted the strategic value of space and its ultimate exploitation by the superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. They believe that the widespread militarization of space cannot be avoided and advocate the development of new weapons and defenses that, if deployed, would fulfill their prophecy. History, they contend, is in their camp. Ronald H. Stivers, Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for policy, said recently: ''History teaches us that each time a new medium is opened to man it is exploited to gain a military advantage. The course of world affairs has repeatedly been altered by the nation which first grasped the advantages offered by developing the military potential of the newest medium.''"
