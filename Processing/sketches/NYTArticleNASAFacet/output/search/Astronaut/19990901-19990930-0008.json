Written and directed by Rand Ravich (R, 100 minutes). Stylish direction and the heat generated by these two stars can't outweigh the familiarity of the story line. It concerns an astronaut who returns to Earth behaving a little strangely. And not for nothing does Ms. Theron, as the title character, wear the hairdo seen on Mia Farrow in ''Rosemary's Baby.'' Even creatures in other galaxies can guess what's coming. Still, the visual style suggests that this first-time director might fare better with fresher material. And Mr. Depp holds interest by playing the astronaut as one part NASA, two parts Elvis (Janet Maslin)."
