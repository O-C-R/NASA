Jason would be going to New York for the Fourth of July. First there was applause. Then the entire fourth grade gave him a standing ovation. Then his teacher led him from classroom to classroom, making the announcement again and again. From kindergarten right up to eighth grade, it was a day of standing ovations for Jason."

      "lead_paragraph": "CORRIGAN, by Caroline Blackwood. (Penguin, $5.95.) Devina Blunt, a reclusive widow in the English village of Coombe Abbot, is captivated by a flirtatious invalid in this novel by the Irish writer Caroline Blackwood. In The Book Review last year, Carolyn Gaiser called the book ''a charming tour de force'' and a ''delightfully ingenious variation on a familiar story - the aging widow preyed upon by a charming confidence man.'' AGATHA CHRISTIE, by Janet Morgan. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $7.95.) This biography of the celebrated mystery writer ''is a vigorous, lucid and highly readable book that will tell Christie fans what they have long wanted to know,'' Antonia Fraser wrote in these pages in 1985. Ungar has issued THE NEW BEDSIDE, BATHTUB & ARMCHAIR COMPANION TO AGATHA CHRISTIE (Paper, $12.95; Cloth, $25), an expanded and updated edition of its Baedeker of Christieana, with essays on Christie's work as well as synopses of the novels, plays and short-story collections. In 1979 our reviewer called it ''a grand memory book.'' STANLEY ELKIN'S THE MAGIC KINGDOM, by Stanley Elkin. (Obelisk/Dutton, $8.95.) Eddy Bale, mourning the loss of his 12-year-old son, leads a group of terminally ill children on a trip from England to Disney World. The novel's comic vision ''is both hysterical and profound,'' Max Apple said here last year. ''Part sick joke, part lyrical meditation on the nature of disease, the journey to this magic kingdom earns its place among the dark voyages that fiction must take.''"

The moment came just a year after Christa McAuliffe, America's first ''teacher astronaut,'' was introduced to thousands of her proud and jubilant colleagues at last summer's N.E.A. convention in Washington. Mrs. McAuliffe was an active N.E.A. member and had served as president of her union local near Concord, N. H. Now the N.E.A., the nation's largest teachers' union, was once again honoring Mrs. McAuliffe, this time posthumously. Many of her fellow teachers at the union convention here wore T-shirts or buttons carrying Mrs. McAuliffe's motto, ''I touch the future, I teach.'' Her two children were present, as was her husband, who chose the convention to make his first major public statement since the space shuttle Challenger exploded Jan. 28, killing his wife and the six other crew members."

Actually, singing might be the wrong word for the eerie droning intonations he's producing; it sounds more like ritual chanting. Nicholson is emitting these strange sounds while standing in the middle of the living room of his home on top of one of the Hollywood Hills - a hilltop he shares with Marlon Brando, although Brando's house is on somewhat higher ground. In order to generate these particular noises, Nicholson has assumed a posture that suggests his post-shock-treatment mode in ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' His arms hang limply at his sides, his shoulders droop into a posture that verges on the simian. His jaw is slack, his face drained of expression. To his left, out beyond the glass wall of his living room, the canyons of Hollywood are beginning to redden with the sunset. To his right, on the opposite wall, is one of his Picassos - an interesting early Cubist work that looks to be a painting of a painting of a woman. And from Nicholson's middle comes pouring out, in deep, resonant, utterly uninflected, cello tones: THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE . . . . BLIIIIIIIINNNNNNDDDDD . . . . MIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCE . . . ."

For a time after World War II, this camera -smaller and more flexible than the 4x5 and bigger but slower in operation than the 35-millimeter - was the center of photographic attention. Small enough for use by fast-moving journalists, it produced a quality image that held up well against 4-by-5 film. What slowed the medium-format camera's progress? Designers of 35-millimeter cameras began producing lighter, smaller bodies with a great variety of sharp, fast, quality lenses. In addition, film producers added quality films like 35-millimeter Kodachrome to gadget bags. New versatility and greater image quality for 35-millimeter eclipsed the medium-format cameras, the best-known of which produced 2 1/4-by-2 1/4 images on 120 roll film."

In a report requested by President Reagan, the agency also indicated it hoped to redesign the booster rockets so that existing hardware can be used. Problems with the booster rockets caused the Jan. 28 Challenger disaster in which the crew of seven died. But as a contingency, should this equipment prove unable to pass tests and safety reviews, the agency said it would also develop concepts for ''a totally new design that does not utilize existing hardware.''"

The claim charges that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and several of its employees should have known that ''a catastrophic accident would likely occur'' and had failed to take action to prevent it. The space agency will have six months to decide how to handle the claim, which was dated July 2 and filed with the space agency under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The claim is the first by survivors of the Challenger crew's of seven, killed in the disaster Jan. 28. An investigation by a Presidential commission uncovered and described in detail numerous errors and misjudgments by the space agency and its chief rocket builder that led to the accident."

According to the official Soviet press agency Tass, the craft touched down at 4:34 P.M. about 33 miles northeast of the city of Arkalyk. The two astronauts, Col. Leonid D. Kizim, 44 years old, and Vladimir A. Solovyov, 39, looked tired and serious as they sat in low chairs and were interviewed by Soviet state television soon after landing. Both men are space veterans, having set a endurance record of 238 days in space in 1984 with a third astronaut. Tass said Colonel Kizim, the commander, and Mr. Solovyov, the flight engineer, were in good health."

The memorandum, obtained by the magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology, said that ''program morale is poor'' and ''people do not believe in this station.'' Space agency officials confirmed that astronauts had prepared a memorandum about their complaints for presentation June 20 to the project manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. The memorandum was written by C. Gordon Fullerton, an experienced shuttle astronaut, but reflected the views of other astronauts as well as middle-level managers of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration."

Already this year the Soviet Union has conducted more than 40 major launchings, established a large new space station and achieved a space-age first by ferrying astronauts between stations in orbit. Last week they moved a step closer to their goal of a permanent manned presence in space by completing a four-month mission. And in interviews last week Soviet space planners, scientists and experts outlined an ambitious series of ventures meant to stretch well into the next century. In the future, Soviet engineers hope to inaugurate a new generation of rockets, an advanced space shuttle and the first large space-based radio telescope. And Soviet planetary scientists, fresh from celebrating a successful flight past Halley's Comet, are planning a series of unmanned probes toward Venus, the Martian moon Phobos, and beyond."

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which had previously said the crew was unaware of the impending disaster, made public a transcript of tape recordings in the Jan. 28 flight's final seconds that provided ''the first potential indication,'' the agency said, that the crew knew the accident was occurring. According to the transcript, the last recorded communication by any of the astronauts was the comment ''uh oh,'' made by the pilot, Michael J. Smith, 73 seconds after launching, just after the shuttle lurched and before it broke up in flames. Breathing Supplies Activated NASA also disclosed that at least three of the seven individual emergency breathing supplies on the shuttle had been manually activated, indicating that the astronauts were struggling to survive in the spacecraft's final moments. There were indications that one of the packs could not have been turned on by the person using it, and that one of his companions turned it on for him."
