If the space agency could provide shuttle rides for two politicians who controlled its budget in the mid-1980's, if it could send a teacher aloft to inspire the nation's schoolchildren on the ill-fated Challenger mission in 1986, then why should it not launch a renowned if ancient astronaut who wants a last big hurrah in space at the age of 77, after he steps down from Congress? At least Mr. Glenn has the experience and competence to perform the job. He has been flying his own plane and exercising like a maniac to keep in shape for his rendezvous with the cosmos. This is one old warrior who refuses to fade away. Of course the stated justification for this excursion is mostly nonsense, a fig-leaf rationalization dreamed up by Mr. Glenn during two years of lobbying for the trip and only accepted after considerable pondering by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. There is hardly a burning need to study the effect of weightlessness on an elderly man's physical processes or to correlate muscle deterioration in space with muscle deterioration in the ground-based elderly. If there were, NASA would long ago have rocketed geriatric astronauts into the heavens and would not so readily have jettisoned its old-timers."

The International Monetary Fund thought it had a deal in October to bail out the country and put it on a more austere path. Then came a 1998 budget that imposed austerity on everyone but the Government and the well connected. High-level visitors flocked to Jakarta to explain to the Suharto Government that this just wouldn't do. On Monday, Version 1.1 of the deal had Indonesia pledging to behave and getting a few concessions on budget surpluses and bank closings. (The latter, the I.M.F. acknowledged, had clearly backfired.) But once again the deal was threatened by rear-guard actions to spare the vast business empires of President Suharto's family and friends from the bitter economic pill. Progressively bigger wigs -- including President Clinton and Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director -- weighed in. On Thursday, President Suharto finally agreed to Version 2.0, with its long list of stringent particulars and much less wriggle room."

      "lead_paragraph": "THE world of design has something for everyone, but is there a need for a chair a person can't get out of? An eye-catching new computer stand and reclining-desk-chair combination called the Netsurfer, by Valvomo-Design of Helsinki, Finland, sits in the up-to-the-minute window of Moss, 146 Greene Street, in SoHo. The chair promises a relaxing, back-friendly seat for people who work (and play) at home. The designers assume that anyone who wants to surf the Net likes being locked into astronaut position. In other words, the chair is recumbent. Armed with advice from Dr. John Kella, an ergonomics consultant with a Ph.D. in biomechanics, and great expectations, the writer set out for a test -- in the store window. At the top of the checklist was the ease of getting in and out of the chair. That proved to be so important that the test subject forgot the rest of the list. The Netsurfer Classic, upholstered in leather, is the most expensive of three models: $4,995. Lowering oneself into this futuristic-looking chair while straddling the seat is difficult, and getting up from a supine position is hard on the back. ''It's the Harley-Davidson of chairs,'' said Ahti Antikainen, sales manager of Valvomo. ''And not everyone is comfortable on a Harley.'' One sits semireclined on this model with, the promotional material says, ''the computer between the legs like the gas tank of a motorcycle.'' This seat has an adjustable tilt, foot rests, neck and lumbar cushions and lift-up computer shelf and armrests. If only the human body were equally adjustable. The Netsurfer Classic seems best for bikers, astronauts or agile teen-agers. Women should not try this chair in a skirt. Once extracted from the Classic, the tester sampled the mid-price Netsurfer Max ($3,325), which is the same as the Classic, but upholstered in fabric. Again, for the fit and agile. The Netsurfer Light ($3,125), however, has two separate, comfortable units -- chair and computer stand, both on wheels. Getting into the chair is a breeze. A user can work with the computer station or enjoy the chair and workstation separately. Dr. Kella also tried the seats. His assessment was, ''Too much tech.''"

While scientists applaud his homework assignment -- studying the impact of weightlessness on aging -- skeptics wonder if the future will really find Century Village retirees playing shuffleboard on the Mir space station. As delusional space cadets know, the Pol-in-Orbit program was adapted from the secret Enemy-to-the-Moon plan drafted in 1973 by the Nixon Administration. On a newly released White House tape, President Nixon angrily tells the then-F.B.I. Director, L. Patrick Gray, that he hoped to send Archibald Cox, Elliot Richardson and Woodstock's Wavy Gravy on an Apollo flight, ''or any damn spacecraft we've got, manned or monkeyed!''"

Additionally, he has traveled to all ends of the earth -- Australia, South America, Africa -- to chase eclipses and the better views of things in the sky. His work has been published in Astronomy, the Observers Guide, Sky and Telescope and other magazines. He has had shows at various galleries. By profession a professor of computer sciences at Westchester Community College, he said he loves and takes teaching ''very, very seriously,'' but it is the astronomy that touches the metaphysical side of his being."
