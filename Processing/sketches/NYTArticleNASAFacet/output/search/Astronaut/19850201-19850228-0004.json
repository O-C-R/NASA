His celestial exploits are legendary: America remembers how he read from the Bible on Christmas Eve as he commanded the first manned orbit of the moon. Since then, Mr. Borman's sights have become more terrestrial. For nearly a decade, he has headed chronically troubled Eastern Air Lines, the nation's third-largest carrier. But, in that time, Mr. Borman has failed to break the cycle of crisis that continues to haunt Eastern and has steered the airline dangerously close to financial disaster. Trouble struck again this month - the most serious Eastern has ever faced. The airline fell into technical default to its bankers over its inability to draft a new employee wage contract. Eleventh-hour negotiations eventually produced the needed agreement, but deeper problems remain. Eastern has been unprofitable since 1979 and it is unclear when - and if - it will begin making money. The airline has racked up $380 million in losses over the last five years, and its debt has swelled to a staggering $2.5 billion. Labor relations are touchy, at best, and the good will that Mr. Borman once enjoyed is now long gone."
