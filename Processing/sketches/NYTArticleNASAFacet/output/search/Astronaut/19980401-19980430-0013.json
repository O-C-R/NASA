      "lead_paragraph": "My son's godparents live in England. ''Why is everyone so obsessed with lecturing you about the virtue of sports?'' they asked me during a recent visit to New York. It was one of those questions that make you instantly aware of cultural boundaries, for in fact I have never felt lectured, and I don't think my friends here are really obsessed. Yet upon further discussion, it became clear that what the godparents were responding to was an undeniable shift in some people's image of me ever since I adopted my son. Seemingly overnight, I was transformed from a spinsterish, over-40 law professor in an ''all-male world'' into the roiling Medusa archetype of Black Single Mother. What they were observing, in other words, was a low drumbeat of worried chiding from numerous male friends and acquaintances that I deliver my son up to the great gods of sports. Some of this is inevitable: I am blessed with a little boy who, at 5, is conspicuously large, who can hit a home run and play goalie, who has a nice golf stroke. But since he is already deeply and happily involved in sports, I worry that an aspect of this pressure is actually a cipher for anxieties about his fatherlessness. Sometimes it's overt: why did I ''choose'' a boy to rear by myself? Sometimes it's more subtle, as in their singular absorption with imbuing my son with sporty ''guy'' mannerisms, from adjusting the angle of his baseball cap to high- and low-fiving -- everything but how to spit a wad of tobacco. Furthermore, since many of my friends are white, and the gestures of hypermasculinity are so often coded as black, there's an almost comic aspect of triangulated projection about it all. ''Basketbaaawwl!'' says my preternaturally husky-voiced, little black son, sounding exactly like a white person imitating a black person who has absorbed the message that heterosexual identity and social acceptance are tied up with the ability to say that word in just that way, and so ends up imitating a white person imitating.. . . This is a touchy thing to talk about, I know. On the one hand, I am genuinely grateful for my friends' interventions. It's certainly true that, reared in a family of girls, I never quite fathomed the culture of sports -- the gladiatorial politics, the body envy somehow vaguely related to anxieties about weight and hair, the pressure to do Little League a bit like the pressure put on young girls to excel at ballet. It mystifies me, this stuff about the pain, the pathos, the glory, the contradiction. I have a friend who is always limping off to Toys ''R'' Us to buy my son footballs, bats and shinguards. A 50-ish former triathlete, he has had four knee operations and can hardly walk. ''Sports are the most satisfying part of a man's life,'' he says, gritting his manly teeth against his pain. On the other hand, there is an undercurrent sometimes that assumes I will be the ruination of my son. Sports will keep him out of trouble. He's a happy, normal 5-year-old. Why the assumption of trouble? Organized sports will teach him discipline, cooperation and fair play. Perhaps, although the same might be said for homework, music lessons and the tutelage of kind adults. Your son has the hands of a great athlete -- look at that spread! Yup, I say, and he'll have a reach wide enough to play Rachmaninoff. That last remark always seems to send them over the top, as if I had said, ''I plan to dress him in lace collars and velvet pantaloons.'' And so they gallop right to the heart of it: Sports are where the secrets of manhood are lodged. Guys will make fun of him if he doesn't know the rules of the game. Aha. There is an unfortunate polarizing of the paths to success that too frequently leads people to act as though all aspects of my son's being were insignificant beside the prowess promised by the mass of a 75-pound 5-year-old. Why are you bothering with music lessons? He's got basketball scholarship stamped on his forehead, says a friend who went to college on a chemistry scholarship. It's not just that my son's bursting physicality seems to bring out the thwarted athlete in my bookish, tweedy, bespectacled male friends; it's as if they're upset because I have expanded my son's life opportunities. How can you get a good hoop dream going when he's living in a home with all those silly intellectual distractions? There are, in my experience, some subtly different emphases between black and white men's anxieties in this. Both fear that the fledgling male instinct will be crushed by an unchecked voodoo of single-mother sissification, and both implore me to consider the virtues of football as a route to college. Still, white friends tend to be more enamored of big-game heroism as an end in itself; black friends more often underscore the eventual escape from gladiatorial status that an all-expenses-paid college education might mean. While both urge sports as a way of keeping testosterone eruptions under control, it's my white friends who tend to worry about mindless adventurism with women and cars; my black friends worry about channeling social frustrations, depression and feelings of rage. I also sense a class-based, highly specialized metaphoric order that is emerging these days, organized a little like a corporate beehive. The nerdy Bill Gates bees are on top, all brain and genetic endowment but with soft, impractical bodies. And below are the worker bees, who enjoy buff bodies but no brains. (Even my son's Michael Jordan doll -- excuse me, action figure -- underlines this division: the body stands about eight inches tall; its head is the size of a lima bean.) This part of the image is limited enough, but there's a racial component, too. The brains are white, the bodies are black. Everyone wants to be a brain. No one wants to be a black body -- at least in this Manichaean sense -- even blacks, whose political energy has been siphoned into that great yes-and-no quagmire: Am I only and always this body? Similarly, working-class and middle-class whites fight for a place in this system, twisting back and forth from envying and fetishizing the black physique (particularly in the realms of crime and sports) to proving that they themselves are truly deserving of white brains. (Their presumptive positioning on the bell curve of life, as proffered by sociobiologists, has been particularly handy in this regard.) Against such a backdrop, my son and children like him, their strong little bodies connoting more than their young brains can comprehend, search the faces around them for approval and a sense of destiny. Annoying I may be, but I want the adult faces that look back into those trusting and hopeful eyes to reflect a range of possibilities as broad as my wonderful male friends themselves -- black and white, Asian and South American, professionals and mechanics, accountants and poets, tall and short, athletic and not very. Ultimately, the brain must abide in the physical realm, and the body will survive only as a thinking being. These two conceptual halves are what need most to be married in the world, for without that we stray from the path to our salvation. My son has got the knack. ''I can jump backwards into bed,'' he says. ''Want to see me? I can do it just like an astronaut coming back to earth. Pretend this is the earth's atmosphere.'' He pats the bed. ''Here I go. No. Pretend I'm half astronaut and half a whale. I can balance a basketball on my nose. Watch this. I'm going to leap into earth's atmosphere, leave a trail of sparks across the sky and land backwards in the sea with a basketball on my nose. Pretend this is the basketball.'' He puts his finger to his nose. ''Here I go.'' He runs, runs, runs across the room, leaps, does a miraculous half twist in the air, lands backward on the rickety bed. He looks a bit like an astronaut; he looks somewhat like a breaching baby whale; he looks exactly like my little boy. When he resurfaces, the basketball is still balanced perfectly upon his nose."

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the longtime Libyan leader who is set to invade continental North America this month by way of, um, short fiction. His book, ''Escape to Hell and Other Stories,'' is a collection of stories and essays originally written in Arabic. It comes to the English-speaking world courtesy of Alain Stanke, a Montreal publisher. Also in on the deal was Pierre Salinger, the former J.F.K. press secretary and air-disaster theorist who discusses Qaddafi's work (political and fictional) in the book's preface. So what can readers expect? Sizzle. Stanke calls Qaddafi ''an original thinker whose ideas flow from the ever-developing and conflicting reality of what is best and most beautiful.'' Here's a look: A STYLE OF HIS OWN -- ''Statesmen are known to resort to the services of ghostwriters,'' Stanke says in a press release, but not the leader known to his people as ''The Guide,'' who insists onholding the quill personally. (And pressing the flesh: Salinger had already met Qaddafi in Libya.) Qaddafi obviously does not fear big, writerly subjects. In one story, ''The Suicide of the Astronaut,'' a poor symbolic sap who's been to space can't hack it back on Earth and -- but enough! Why spoil the ending? He also writes about a rival country sickened by ''individualism and rampant capitalism,'' a nasty kind of place called ''Amelica.'' THE MESSAGE -- What Qaddafi really wants to talk about is how much of a mess we've made of the planet. ''The earth is the lung through which you breathe,'' he warns, ''so if you destroy it, you will have no way to breathe.'' Part of the problem is that we live in cities, and that's bad because the city is ''a graveyard of social connections and relations.'' What we need to do, more or less, is ''depart the city and flee to the village, where you will see the moon for the first time in your lives. You will change from being worms and rats....'' And snails, let us not forget the snails: ''The city is also a sea, full of flotsam and snails. The snails are people.'' NO PLANS TO TOUR -- Stanke reports that these days, Qaddafi is a bit of a recluse, spending most of his time in his tent ''in order to meditate, study...and write!'' There's no word yet on what he's working on now. As for Stanke, he believes this whole world-leader-taking-time-to-scribble thing could be the start of something very big. ''I don't know specifically of any other projects involving world leaders,'' a Stanke spokesman says. ''But I know that Stanke has met Castro. There may be something there.''"

''We're going into outer space to understand inner space.''"

One hot-tempered astronaut escapes his simian captors and learns -- in the film's eye-popping final scene, when he comes upon the Statue of Liberty jutting from the sand on a desolate beach -- that the crew has landed on Earth itself, after an apocalyptic nuclear war."
