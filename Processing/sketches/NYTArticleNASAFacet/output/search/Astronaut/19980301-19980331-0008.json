Yesterday, 30 Chinatown leaders gathered at the Fifth Precinct station house to denounce the script, which focuses on a corrupt Chinese officer who patronizes prostitutes, accepts bribes from underworld bosses and gives them advance notice of gambling raids. They also objected to descriptions of gang wars in the script. ''We have worked hard with the police to finally erase this image of Chinatown,'' said STEVEN WONG, who represents a number of Chinatown organizations. Mr. Stone's spokeswoman would not comment."

And Time magazine's lavish 75th anniversary gala didn't disappoint. Forget the last so-called party of the decade -- the Versace event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This was the bash of the pre-millennium. Some wags dubbed it Walter's bar mitzvah, referring to Walter Isaacson, the magazine's managing editor, who served as unofficial emcee. But that doesn't do justice to an evening that in its mix of real and surreal, politesse and politics, could have been scripted by Tom Stoppard. One newspaper editor glanced at the multi-tiered, concentric red dining space that had been erected over the seats at Radio City Music Hall and likened it to a media version of purgatory. (The floorboards were virtually bulletproof, and courtesy of President Clinton's security detail, the building was patrolled by a pack of bomb-sniffing dogs, and there were sharpshooters mounted on the roof.)"

Throughout his 89 years, the Newtown resident has approached the impossible and proved it otherwise. Case in point: his federally approved flying automobile. You've never heard of the Airphibian? That's hard to believe if you were alive and old enough to read in the early 1950's because Mr. Fulton and his flying car were profiled in every popular magazine of the era. He logged more than 100,000 miles in test flights, going cross-country numerous times, and showcasing his invention in Canada, Mexico, Britain and the Netherlands. Inspectors for the Civil Aeronautics Administration liked the design so well they placed an order for 10 Airphibians they intended to use to get to work."
