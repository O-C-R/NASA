Whistler, Goya and Paul Klee also studied the heavens after dark. During the last 50 years, however, breakthroughs in astronomy and space exploration have changed how artists portray the cosmos. Where once it glittered with remote objects onto which romantic longing could be projected, it now beckons with reachable destinations, whose topographical details -- craters, ice fields, volcanic ridges -- have been revealed. While the images beamed back from robotic spacecraft are by definition ''up close,'' they are far from ''personal.'' Artists, though, have interpreted scientific information in ways that heighten intimacy. In 1971 and '72, the painter and printmaker Vija Celmins (who has just won a MacArthur grant) took actual images of the lunar surface returned by the Surveyor lander and re-created them, detail by painstaking detail, in a richly layered pencil drawing. ''I was attracted by the cool blandness of the scientific image,'' she said, and wanted to translate it into something ''that like the moon, had real dust.''"
