The work is the fourth part of the Mamaroneck composer's ongoing orchestral series, \"The Exiled Heart,\" which is based on works by the American poet Theodore Roethke. The journey of the exile, Ms. Ekizian says, is a metaphor for living and represents humanity's search for tranquillity and peace."
