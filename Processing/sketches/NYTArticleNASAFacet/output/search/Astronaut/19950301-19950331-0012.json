Dr. Graybiel was among the doctors who examined John Glenn after his Mercury spacecraft circled Earth three times in February 1962 in the first orbital mission by an American.

Aero Astro, a start-up company specializing in small spacecraft, wanted to get the Air Force's attention on a proposal for the world's smallest satellite. So last fall, an Air Force colonel, Aero Astro's president and several colleagues took a three-pound prototype and bicycled 479 miles over the mountains from Colorado Springs to Albuquerque, N.M., to present the idea to officials at the Phillips Laboratory space research center. The Air Force got the point, and last month gave Aero Astro a contract to develop a trio of the tiny satellites, which might be launched within two years for experimental use. \"When a colonel and I walk into a general's office in biking clothes and pull a satellite out of a saddle bag, he remembers,\" said Rick Fleeter, president and founder of Aero Astro, a seven-year-old privately held company based in Herndon, Va."

On Tuesday, Norman E. Thagard became the first American to ride into space on a Russian rocket, flying up to the Russian Mir Space station to help start a long-term collaboration between Russian and American astronauts. Dr. Thagard fulfilled all the Russian traditions -- he urinated on the wheels of the truck that led him to the spaceship, he got weightless welcoming hugs from his fellow astronauts and he received a gift of bread and salt."

When the astronaut Norman E. Thagard became the first American to soar into orbit on a Russian rocket last week, it was a historic moment for both Russia and the United States. But in many ways it has also served to publicize the deep flaws in the Russian space program, which just five years ago seemed an almost invincible symbol of Soviet power and pride."

Backstage in her dressing room before a recent performance, the actress is, unsurprisingly, the opposite of her character: vibrant, down to earth and filled with enthusiasm for the actor's life. For 15 years, she has been a virtuosic theatrical professional, appearing on Broadway (a Tony nomination for \"Our Country's Good\"), Off Broadway and regional theater, but people keep discovering her. She is not, of course, an overnight star. Hard work and a long apprenticeship have nurtured her natural talent and have allowed her to keep her new success in perspective. And she knows there are other actresses, including her friends J. Smith-Cameron and Hope Davis, who, with a breakthrough role, could \"fly to the moon.\" For the moment, it is Ms. Jones, at 38, who is on the moon, and enjoying every minute of it."
