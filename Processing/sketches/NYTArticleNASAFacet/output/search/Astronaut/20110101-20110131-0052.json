      "lead_paragraph": "ON Friday a time machine will land on the stage of the Abrons Arts Center. The crew -- an astronaut, a squishy space alien and a cyborg with a mustache -- will try to transport audience members to the future, saving them from ''an event so potent it turned this entire planet into a grave.'' Unfortunately this future features endless copulation and meals salvaged from one's own bodily waste. To get there, spectators will first have to survive goofy costumes, low-tech special effects, alien mucus sacs and at least one appalling dance number. ''The Annihilation Point,'' a spoofy piece of lo-fi sci-fi from the Berserker Residents, a Philadelphia company committed to producing fantastical shows, is the latest example in the current surge of science fiction in the theater. Though playwrights as varied as Karel Capek, George Bernard Shaw, Sam Shepard and Caryl Churchill have composed plays in the genre, these scripts are staged rarely, and new ones usually arrive just as infrequently."

The president directly confronted the political debate that erupted after the rampage, urging people of all beliefs not to use the tragedy to turn on one another. He did not cast blame on Republicans or Democrats, but asked people to ''sharpen our instincts for empathy.''"

Doctors called her progress ''a major leap forward'' but expressed caution, saying that for now, they would not upgrade Ms. Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, from critical condition. Dr. Peter Rhee, head of trauma at the hospital, said in an interview that the team planned to bring an expert neuro-ophthalmologist and oculoplastic surgeon to help assess the injuries to the bones around Ms. Giffords's eyes. The damage to the area could have damaged her vision, Dr. Rhee said."

In this, her directorial debut, she follows four Iranian women from different classes and backgrounds during August 1953, when elements in favor of the monarchy ousted Mohammed Mossadegh and his democratically elected government and restored Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to power, with the help of clandestine support from Britain and the United States. Zarin (Orsi Toth) is an emancipated prostitute who has fled her brothel for refuge at a public bath; Munis (Shabnam Tolouei, above) is a virtual prisoner in the house she shares with her fundamentalist brother, whom the religiously devout Faezeh (Pegah Ferydoni) secretly longs to marry; and Fakhri (Arita Shahrzad), a wealthy 50-year-old, is suffering in an unhappy marriage to a general who reviles her for being menopausal. ''This visually transfixing film, which originated as a video installation, has the feel of an exhibition of Ms. Neshat's work whose figures have stirred to life to play out a tragic feminist allegory,'' Stephen Holden wrote in his review in The New York Times. The film is loosely adapted from a novel by Shahrnush Parsipur, who appears briefly as the bossy madam of the brothel. 8 P.M.

Earlier, excerpts from the interview did provide a boost to ABC's ''World News With Diane Sawyer,'' which attracted an average of 9.1 million viewers, the newscast's largest audience in almost a year. CBS led the night over all, also garnering 17.3 million at 9 for ''NCIS: Los Angeles.'' NBC placed second with ''The Biggest Loser,'' from 8 to 10 (8.2 million), followed by ''Parenthood'' (5.6 million). ABC, in third, averaged 5.7 million at 8 and 9 with ''No Ordinary Family'' and ''V,'' while Fox ranked fourth with a rerun of ''Glee'' at 8 (4.4 million) and ''Million Dollar Money Drop'' at 9 (5.3 million)."

The wounded lawmaker, whose against-the-odds fight for survival has inspired people across the country, received a warm farewell from her hometown. Well-wishers lined the streets of Tucson and waved at her ambulance as it went from the hospital to an airport. Some held signs, balloons and flowers. Television helicopters buzzed overhead."

But the video made plain that his speech would be geared more broadly toward the political center, to independent voters and business owners and executives alienated by the expansion of government and the partisan legislative fights of the past two years."

But at least we will be spared more weeks of trans-Hudson nyah-nyahing over whether the team belongs to New York or, as reality would suggest, New Jersey. This is an old dispute, but it has acquired a sharper edge than usual thanks to New Jersey's blunt-speaking governor, Chris Christie. Before the loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, Mr. Christie was more defiant than most of his predecessors about who has claim to a team that defies geography by calling itself the New York Jets."

The incident prompted an uproar in Afghanistan, where Islamic fundamentalists consider certain music sinful. Some traditionalists called for Setara's death, while many young people saw her as a courageous role model willing to challenge restrictions on women's freedom. This sequel from Havana Marking picks up the story six months later, after Setara has abandoned her musical career for marriage and motherhood, while clinging to her independent spirit and fighting for her safety. ''Afghan Star'' leads in at 6:30. 8 P.M.
