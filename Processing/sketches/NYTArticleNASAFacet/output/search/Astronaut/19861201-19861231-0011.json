Fletcher, the NASA Administrator who awarded the contract for the space shuttle rockets that led to the Challenger disaster, says that he will ''seriously consider'' removing himself from all future determinations on shuttle booster contracts. His statement came in an interview on Friday after he heard a review of accusations, made by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, competitive contractors and various aerospace experts, that his original decision could appear to have been biased in favor of a Utah company. Dr. Fletcher insisted that the decision was ''squeaky clean'' and was made on its technical merits, containing no hint of personal favoritism. He said he did not recall any questions of bias being raised in 1973, when the contract for the shuttle booster rockets was awarded to Morton Thiokol Inc. of Brigham City, Utah. Review of Booster Decision Dr. Fletcher, appointed again this year to head the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, spoke in reaction, also, to information contained in newly disclosed or re-examined documents and provided in dozens of interviews, part of an investigation by The New York Times over the past several months into the origins and loss of the Challenger."

Strong research and development programs, some subsidized directly or indirectly by governments, have resulted in the creation of a cadre of scientists and engineers whose contributions have earned the respect of the industrialized world."

Once merely a symbol of the nation's pride and ingenuity, Indian space technology has become an integral part of its communications, weather forecasting and resource management systems. ''We started modestly and built step by step,'' said U. R. Rao, director of the Indian space program. ''There was a lot of criticism along the way. But today everyone is convinced that this is the best way to meet the country's needs.'' A few major developing countries, such as Brazil and China, have also developed space technology, principally for military purposes. But Western scientists say that no other country outside the United States, Europe and the Soviet Union has achieved India's broad and deep ability to use space in civilian life. Scientists say India offers a case study of how a developing country can exploit advanced technology to meet fundamental needs."

      "lead_paragraph": "Piece by painstaking piece, NASA is revamping the space shuttle system that disintegrated, along with a good measure of the nation's technological self-confidence, 11 months ago today. The next shuttle orbiter that astronauts clamber into on the Kennedy Space Center launching pad will probably include a crude but effective escape system for them to use in case disaster strikes again. Its landing brakes will be improved. Its main liquid fuel engines will be upgraded, and for the first time astronauts may fly without harboring the seldom-spoken fear that a malfunction in a simple 17-inch valve could choke off the craft's liquid fuel supply and send it crashing into the sea. Much Safer Craft Is Seen The safety changes being made by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration thus go far beyond the redesigning of the solid-fuel booster rocket whose failure killed seven astronauts 73 seconds into the flight of the Challenger last Jan. 28. While the debate over how to redesign those boosters has drawn much attention, both agency officials and outside experts are concerned that other critical elements of the shuttle may have been neglected amid the pressures to keep flying that contributed to the Challenger's destruction."

The agency appears well on its way to repairing defects blamed for the disaster last January that grounded the space shuttles. And it has begun to reorganize its faulty management structure along the lines recommended by the Presidential commission that investigated the accident, which killed the seven Challenger crew members. In only 11 months, a vast majority of the top officials in shuttle operations have been replaced. NASA headquarters in Washington has a new Administrator, a new Deputy Administrator and a new Associate Administrator for Space Flight; the directors of NASA's three most important field centers have changed; and all the key engineering managers at the Marshall Space Flight Center who were faulted in the accident have been swept out."

Thus, 11 months after the worst disaster in spacefaring history, the United States finds itself well into the space age without a bold vision of where it is going and what it wants to achieve in space and without a coherent, comprehensive national policy guiding its diverse endeavors, according to aerospace experts, members of Congress and space officials. As a consequence, they say, the nation is in danger of forfeiting its position as the leader in space, a loss that could have economic and strategic implications well into the 21st century. The non-military space program, its many triumphs a receding memory, is especially seen as in grave danger. Visions and Realities Once there were manned voyages to the Moon, regular, unmanned departures for the distant planets and a fair wind of shared national commitment that seemed sure to carry those who ventured far beyond the Earth. Once there were dreams of bases on the Moon, humans tramping on the red plains of Mars. The dreams, it once seemed, were so manifestly achievable as to be less like visions than expressions of tomorrow's reality."

Jarvis and Christa McAuliffe, a New Hampshire schoolteacher - had agreed to settle ''all potential claims'' in the Challenger explosion, which also killed three other astronauts.
