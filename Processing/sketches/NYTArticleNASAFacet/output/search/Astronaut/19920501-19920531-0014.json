So close was the friendship with the astronaut, a physicist named Dirk Frimout, that Mr. Kindt was the only Belgian journalist invited to a party held for the Atlantis crew in Houston on April 5. Then, on April 7, Mr. Kindt returned from the United States to Brussels, and three days later he was arrested on charges of spying for the former Soviet Union and for Russia."

And as the satellite they saved on Wednesday blasted toward its correct orbit, aerospace experts praised and debated the high-stakes rescue that featured history's first satellite capture by astronauts using nothing but their gloved hands."

After two years of design, development and testing, months of practice by astronauts in simulators, all at a cost of $7 million, the device finally performed as it was designed to do, securing the Intelsat-6 satellite once the astronauts grabbed it, space agency engineers said Friday. But they said the 15-foot capture bar fell victim to the limits of knowledge about how to work in the weightlessness of space."
