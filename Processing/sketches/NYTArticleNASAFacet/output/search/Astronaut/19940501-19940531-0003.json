The last time this question produced even a faint buzz behind the national forehead, Ronald Reagan was settling into his first term as President, \"Cheers\" was a promising new sitcom, and a young former television weatherman named David Letterman was waiting impatiently between NBC network jobs. Mr. Letterman would soon occupy the very time slot filled by Mr. Snyder. At the time, NBC's management consensus was that America had seen quite enough of Mr. Snyder -- an inquisitive, occasionally foul-tempered newsman, then 44 years old, whose arm-waving, cigarette-smoke-filled interviews had propelled his late night talk show, \"Tomorrow,\" since 1973."

On one side are three artists who, over two and a half years, transformed an 18,000-square-foot lobby at 47-44 31st Street into an eye-popping sculptural installation made of recycled materials, scrap and abandoned appliances reconfigured into a huge silver fish, a moon that opens up to reveal an astronaut with a trash-can head, a bathtub sun and much more."

The artists are John J. Veronis, John Swing and John Carter. In his ruling, the judge, David N. Edelstein, accepted the argument of Richard A. Altman, the lawyer for the artists, that the sculpture qualifies for protection under the Visual Artists' Rights Act, a Federal statute that has been in effect since June 1991 but has never been tested in court."
