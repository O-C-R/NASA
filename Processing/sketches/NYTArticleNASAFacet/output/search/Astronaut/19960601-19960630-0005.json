In the last few years, however, he has shifted to more serious roles. In the 1992 film \"One False Move,\" a critically acclaimed crime drama, he played an Arkansas lawman on the trail of three killers. Two years ago, James Cameron cast him as a sleazy car salesman to add a jolt of edgy humor to the Arnold Schwarzenegger action film \"True Lies.\" And last year he survived re-entry into Earth's atmosphere as Fred Haise, the prankish astronaut who becomes violently ill in the highly successful \"Apollo 13.\""

We were the 60's kids whose anti-war protests, wreathed in marijuana smoke, brought police to Harvard Yard and whose strike for multicultural causes brought classes to a halt. If you want to locate the epicenter of the boomer elite that so many Americans, especially those who despise Bill Clinton, love to hate, here we are. Lani Guinier was in our class; so was Franklin Raines, the President's next budget czar. So was Charles Schumer, the Clintonite Congressman from New York. And so were all manner of draft-dodging potheads. The number of classmates who avoided military service in Vietnam by opting for medical school alone could staff an urban hospital. Our sole heroic war casualty was Jonathan Netanyahu, brother of Benjamin, who dropped out to join the Israeli Army and was killed at Entebbe."

He calls up his assistant at his ranch in Jupiter, Fla., and asks her to mail off a packet of 8-by-10 glossies: Burt in his football uniform when he played at Florida State University; Burt in boxing trunks when he was a Golden Gloves champ; Burt in his Brando-look-alike phase. (\"Marlon who?\" he scrawls on the back of the photo.) His favorite shots are from the movie \"Deliverance,\" which made him a star 24 years ago. There's Burt -- wet suit unzipped, arms bared, muscles pumped -- leaning against a truck, a lighted cigar in his hand, a faraway, slightly menacing look in his eye. Reynolds doesn't send off stills from \"Smokey and the Bandit\" or \"The Cannonball Run,\" or any of the other car movies that made him millions in the 70's. And he doesn't want you to see shots of him on \"The Tonight Show,\" amusing Johnny Carson with his tales of swinging Hollywood. He would never send pictures of himself cuddling with Dinah Shore or Sally Field or Loni Anderson. Those parts of his personal history are too tangled. But just Burt, early Burt, in all his macho perfection, when his life was all promise -- that's what he wants you to see. That's the story he wants to remember."
