Frosty Bites, ice cream bits the size of peppercorns, do have a futuristic quality, but they taste a lot better than freeze-dried. They are served in a cup, and you spoon them up like breakfast cereal. The sensation is a little odd, since they lack the softly melting surface of a scoop of ice cream. I can't imagine a rippled flavor like vanilla-fudge or caramel swirl being satisfying in this form, but for crunchy Oreo cookie it's just fine. Frosty Bites are $3.25 a portion and also come in vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, mint-chocolate and rainbow sorbet. Mixing's allowed."
