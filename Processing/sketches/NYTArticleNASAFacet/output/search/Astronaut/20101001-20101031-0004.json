In the debut installment, which will be shown Friday and which Alessandra Stanley reviews here, Mr. Danza is buffeted by strict administrators, outsmarted by his own students and - in a confessional scene that has dogged him throughout the promotion of the series - he breaks down and cries to the camera. (It's O.K., Mr. Danza, you're still the boss to us.)"

If even a relatively little object was to strike a city, millions of people could be wiped out."
