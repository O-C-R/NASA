I applaud the instinct, but I think that a moon shot alone seems more like reaching for past glory than striving for new triumphs. Instead, I think the next step in our space program should be to create a floating launching pad for manned and unmanned missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond. This is not a task for the unfinished International Space Station, which is intended to be a floating laboratory rather than a bridge to the heavens."

In a typical moment during a meeting with reporters in October, Mr. O'Keefe, the administrator of NASA, pulled a small foam brush from his pocket. The space agency had determined more than 20 years ago that a gluelike material called MA-25S could be used to patch the space shuttle's heat-resistant tiles during missions. But scientists never found a way to apply it smoothly, or in a way that did not leave as much goo on the spreader as on the tile. The issue is not about aesthetics; a messy fix could create aerodynamic problems during entry into the atmosphere."

Thirty-three years after the Wright brothers flew, paying customers were snoozing in berths aboard commercial airliners; 33 years after that, men walked on the Moon. Yet today, a third of a century after NASA's lunar triumph, we're down to a fleet of three grounded space shuttles and a low-orbit space station serviced by aging Russian rockets. It's time either to get moving again -- or to cash in our chips and leave human space exploration to other nations. Talk has been that President Bush is preparing a bold new mission plan for NASA, much as John F. Kennedy did in 1961 when he committed the nation to putting a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. Some space enthusiasts are urging Mr. Bush to aim for Mars, but the long time lines involved suggest that he would wind up, as his father did, with nothing to show for it but a few NASA reports with soaring price tags attached and a nagging sense that he'd been had. Others talk of building yet another space station, higher up -- perhaps at the ''L 1 point,'' between Earth and the Moon -- but to say that you are exploring space by orbiting inside a tin can is like claiming to have explored the Atlantic because you made an ocean-liner crossing in a cabin below the waterline."
