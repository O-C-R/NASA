      "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: Regarding Henry S. F. Cooper Jr.'s review of ''Flight: My Life in Mission Control'' (March 11), Chris Kraft's new memoir: John Glenn's historic flight aboard Friendship 7 took place more than 39 years ago. I was his backup pilot. Rightly or wrongly, Deke Slayton was ruled ineligible for the follow-up flight because of a minor heart condition. Rightly or wrongly, I was named to take his place. All manners of hard feelings stemmed from these two unpopular decisions, which I did not make and over which I had no control. I took the flight, named my capsule Aurora 7 and trained hard for the six weeks I had. The flight plan, originally Deke's, called for a number of radical space maneuvers, more photography, more observation and some experiments, all of which I accomplished, in addition to returning safely to earth with the capsule unharmed. These facts alone should be enough to vindicate the flight of Aurora 7. But there was even more: the system failures I encountered during the flight would have resulted in loss of the capsule and total mission failure had a man not been aboard. My postflight debriefings and reports led, in turn, to important changes in capsule design and future flight plans. These too I consider major contributions to our knowledge about spaceflight and to the successes that Wally Schirra and Gordo Cooper met with in their own subsequent flights. Chris Kraft and I have always been at odds about my flight. Yet in his review of ''Flight,'' Henry Cooper seems unaware of the dispute. Chris's style, he says admiringly, succeeds in ''pulling no punches,'' as though this promises a candid and true book, when it could instead be merely vindictive and skewed. A question lingers in this rattled old septuagenarian brain: why is Chris still in the ring throwing punches? Finally, the reviewer notes with interest Chris's early, stark realization that ''things happened so fast in rocketry that an astronaut couldn't do anything'' without help from the ground. A debatable proposition. In any event, Chris never acknowledged that the reverse also holds true: in space things happen so fast that only the pilot knows what to do, and even ground control can't help. Maybe that's why he is still fuming after all these years. Scott Carpenter Vail, Colo."

In APOLLO 13 (1995), when the astronaut James Lovell's wife and colleagues are terrified that Lovell is going to die in space and they very gingerly explain to his elderly mother (Jean Speegle Howard, mother of Ron) that her son is in a tiny bit of danger, she doesn't blink an eye. ''If they could get a washing machine to fly,'' she reassures her little granddaughter, ''my Jimmy could land it.'' And it turns out she's right. Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon play the astronauts whose moon landing shot is canceled because of an oxygen tank explosion that creates a life-threatening, nation-uniting crisis. The people on the ground are memorable, too: Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife, Ed Harris as the flight commander, Gary Sinise as the astronaut bumped from the flight because he'd been exposed to measles. And what an elating tribute to old-fashioned American know-how! -- Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 7."

These days we all do it: mothers, air-traffic controllers, ambidextrous athletes, high-flying executives who manage to eat, take conference calls, write e-mail and conduct board meetings all at the same time. We lionize those who appear to multitask effortlessly and despair at our own haphazard attempts to juggle even two tasks, secretly wondering if there exists a race of superior beings whose brains are hard-wired for multitasking feats. Only recently have neurologists begun to understand what our brains are up to when we do it. What they've learned offers hope to all multitasking delinquents out there. 1. Don't think you can actually do two things at once. Even when you think you're doing more than one thing simultaneously -- say, driving and talking on a cell phone -- you aren't. Unlike a computer, the brain isn't structured as a parallel processor. It performs actions, even very simple actions, in a strict linear sequence. You must complete the first task, or part of that task, before moving on to the next. What we call multitasking is actually task switching."
