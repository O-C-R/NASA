He was considered a master draftsman and, in contrast to some of his colleagues, he wrote his own captions."

So the next step was perhaps inevitable: some of their stuff of history is headed for the auction block. Christie's East, the New York City auction house, will test the market for space memorabilia on Sept. 18. It is putting on sale more than 300 items of space apparel and equipment, mission manuals and notebooks, astronaut-autographed flight plans and commemorative postal covers and coins. The auction house described this as the first large public sale of materials from the American space program, with a few important items included from the Soviet Union's rival program."

They'll kill you there!'' Then the hospital's new president jogs into a staff meeting and, in a scene that takes precisely 25 seconds, fires most of the doctors. When they go to court to get their jobs back, the judge angrily instructs their lawyer to tell his clients he's a toad, then corrects himself, ''a big toad.'' Oh, and the nine-hour operation to remove an inoperable brain tumor from a 9-week-old baby is a success."

How could a thriller starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron be so bad that New Line Cinema, which has been in no hurry to release this film, would not risk screening in advance for the press? Answer: as directed by Rand Ravich, it's actually a lot better than these circumstances suggest. But as written by Mr. Ravich, a screenwriter directing his debut feature, ''The Astronaut's Wife'' is ridiculously derivative. Perhaps no one has told the exact story of an astronaut who experiences two minutes' worth of strangeness in space and then comes home seeming, well, different. But when his wife, Jillian (Ms. Theron), becomes pregnant, it hardly seems coincidental to find her in Mia Farrow's hairdo from ''Rosemary's Baby.'' Ms. Theron's role in the much sharper ''Devil's Advocate'' was another variation on that theme."
