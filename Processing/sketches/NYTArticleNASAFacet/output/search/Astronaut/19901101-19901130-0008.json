Both ventures are bids at futuristic recycling, studying how green plants can take human wastes (urine, feces and carbon dioxide) and turn them into oxygen, water and food for humans living in closed spaces. The result would be a closed, independent, self-contained system in which plants would provide all material sustenance for the humans, including food."

The Senators are all expected to testify, and all have retained prominent Washington lawyers to defend them. Both sides will call witnesses for testimony and cross-examination, and Congressional officials said today that Mr. Bennett may ask two dozen people to testify."

He graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1968 and received a master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics from Purdue University. Colonel Covey has flown more than 4,500 hours in 26 types of aircraft and completed 339 combat missions during two tours in Southeast Asia. He and his wife, Kathleen, have two daughters. Frank L. Culbertson Jr. Pilot Commander Culbertson, 41, of the Navy, will be making his first space flight since becoming an astronaut in 1985. He considers Holly Hill, S.C., his hometown. A graduate of the Naval Academy in 1971, Commander Culbertson has logged more than 3,700 hours in 35 types of aircraft and 350 carrier landings. At the space agency he has helped redesign and test the nosewheel steering, tires and brakes for the space shuttle to provide more safety in landings. After the Challenger accident in 1986, he assisted with the investigations at NASA headquarters in Washington. He has served as the lead capsule communicator at the mission control center for several shuttle flights. He and his wife, Rebecca, have three daughters. Charles D. Gemar Mission Specialist Major Gemar, 35, of the Army, graduated from the Military Academy in 1979. He considers Scotland, S.D., his hometown. Before being selected as an astronaut candidate in 1985, Major Gemar was based at Fort Stewart/Hunter Army Airfield, where he served as an assistant flight operations officer and flight platoon leader for the 24th Combat Aviation Battalion, Wright Army Airfield commander, and chief of the operations Branch at Hunter Army Airfield. At NASA his assignments have included flight program testing and launching support activities at the Kennedy Space Center. This will be his first space flight. He is married to the former Charlene Stringer of Savannah, Ga. Carl J. Meade Mission Specialist Lieutenant Colonel Meade of the Air Force is 40 years old today. He was born at Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois. He graduated from the University of Texas in 1973 and received a master's degree in electronics engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 1975. Before joining the Air Force, he was a Hughes Fellow at the California Institute of Technology and an electronics design engineer at Hughes Aircraft Company.
