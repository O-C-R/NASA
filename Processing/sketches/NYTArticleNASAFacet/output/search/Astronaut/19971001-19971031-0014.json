''Mission to Mir,'' a visually sweeping 40-minute documentary, much of which was shot inside the Russian Mir space station, doesn't talk much about the anxieties and discomforts of space travel, but its close-up pictures of astronauts crammed into tiny spaces certainly let you sense them. Filled with stunning images of rocket launchings along with optimistic talk about international cooperation after the cold war, ''Mission to Mir'' is a seductive advertisement for the United States space program, which has participated with Russia in sending astronauts from both countries to live on the Mir. The twangy-voiced American astronaut Shannon Lucid serves as a likable, down-to-earth poster girl. Unflappably calm and good-natured about her adventures, this salt-of-the-earth wife and mother from Oklahoma laughingly describes the most frustrating moment during her six-month stay in space as coming to the end of a science fiction book one of her children had given her and realizing she wouldn't be able to read the sequel, which explained the plot, until she returned to Earth."

Hawkins Museum of American Folk Art 2 Lincoln Square Manhattan Through Nov. 2 Ricco/Maresca Gallery 529 West 20th Street Chelsea Through Nov. 8 There's no confusion about the name, birthplace and birth date of the folk artist William L. Hawkins (1895-1990). He emblazoned them somewhere on every picture he turned out: WILLIAM L. HAWKINS BORN JULY 27, 1895 KY.'' And his works in these two shows are loud, clear and colorful: from fanciful wild animals to personages, events, fancy buildings and religious tableaux. But by now, so barraged are we with the folksy cuteness of ''outsider'' art that much of Hawkins's work comes across as cliched."

The high walls are covered with crossbows and other menacing medieval weapons, overhead is an imposing astronomical observatory. At eye level, there is a bullet hole in the staircase. But then, none of this is unexpected, for inside the insular computing gaming world Mr. Garriot, the creator of the popular 18-year-old Ultima series of Dungeons and Dragons-style computer games, has a reputation for building elaborate and compelling fantasy worlds. Now, with a new game on the market, he is poised to benefit from both the rise of the Internet and the rapid growth in popularity of multiplayer personal computer games. He is, in fact, quickly becoming the George Lucas of a business that is capturing an increasingly mainstream following."

While the parents look on, a drop of blood is fed into a machine, and a nurse reads impassively from the printout: ''Neurological condition probability, 60 percent. Manic-depression probability, 42 percent. Attention-deficit disorder probability, 89 percent.'' Then, after a pause and a sideways glance at the father: ''Heart disorder probability, 99 percent. Early fatal potential. Life expectancy, 30.2 years.'' Dad is devastated. Only 30 years? On second thought, maybe he'll make the next boy his namesake. Like most scenes in ''Gattaca,'' the science-fiction film that opened on Friday, starring Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, this one evokes the perils of genetic testing. In another sense, however, it could be an allegory for the risky birth of the film itself. A comedy or action film is born every hour, but a drama focused on a serious scientific issue is a rare breed, one fraught with congenital handicaps. Prone to hype, inaccuracy and bloodlessness (call it a high heart-disorder probability), such issue-oriented films tend to sell their subjects short (see ''Outbreak'') or sag under their own good intentions (see ''Contact''). They are, in the futuristic lingo of ''Gattaca,'' ''faith babies.''"
