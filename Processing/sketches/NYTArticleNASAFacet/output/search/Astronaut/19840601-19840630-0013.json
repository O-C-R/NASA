But tonight's performance is the final and culminating event of his 10th-anniversary season as a principal dancer with Ballet Theater, a season that finds him touted as the greatest classical dancer of his generation. It is also a season that Mr. Bujones feels has been one of his happiest and most successful in the company."

The answer, says Mr. Hyams, who is currently directing ''2010,'' a sequel to ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' is: with a great deal of anxiety and awe. It was in the spring of 1968 that ''2001,'' Stanley Kubrick's half-satiric, half-reverent vision of the bland and depersonalized future of the human race was thrust at movie audiences accustomed to science-fiction movies containing gigantic bugs, decaying monsters or malevolent aliens. Though Mr. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, the respected science-fiction author, who had co-written the screenplay, had envisioned a cinematic parallel to Homer's ''Odyssey,'' and though critics were divided in their opinions, there was no mistaking the reaction of audiences. Despite its mystical ending and deliberate tedious stretches designed to demonstrate the boredom of space flight, ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' was the fifth most successful box-office attraction in a year dominated by ''The Graduate.'' Since then, it has been reissued twice and earned M-G- M a total of more than $24 million in North American theaters."

He stares straight ahead, as hordes of reporters push and shove, and autograph seekers tug at his clothing with a frenzy usually reserved for rock stars. Carl Lewis is, at this moment, America's most dazzling athlete. Since he began dominating the world of track and field about four years ago, he has become a magnet for publicity, curiosity and criticism. And now, with the Olympics just a little more than a month off, and the track and field trials underway this weekend in Los Angeles, the heat around this self- contained 22-year-old is more intense than ever."

Western diplomatic sources in Peking assured a visiting Washingtonian recently that planning for this demonstration of international amity in space was on schedule and official confirmation could be expected in a few months. The flight itself will probably not take place until later this decade. The Chinese have sent up more than half a dozen satellites since their first successful launching in 1970. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have invited Brazil, France and West Germany to assign astronauts to go on missions with American teams. China would be the first Communist nation to send along an astronaut."

The orbiting lights burned brighter and more efficiently, according to researchers at the GTE Corporation, which developed and analyzed the experiment."

Wild Berries,'' Yevgeny Yevtushenko's first novel, is the Soviet equivalent of a potboiler. It consists of action, sex, landscape and elementary discussions of Russian life and literature. The descriptions of landscape are the best part; Mr. Yevtushenko is, after all, a well-known poet. Here and there, he manages a nice vignette or two, but generally the writing and the plotting are slapdash. In fact, it's remarkable that such an experienced poet should be so clumsy even in his first novel. It's hard to say whether he's careless or disorganized or whether he's attempting to borrow the loose, associational structure of modern Western fiction. Whatever the case may be, it doesn't work. In one chapter, the book leaps from Siberia to Chile to show President Salvador Allende Gossens having his portrait painted. The sole link here seems to be that there are politics everywhere. Another chapter introduces a California rock group called the Tails, and here the cross-reference is the fact that a member of the group had visited the Soviet Union as a high school student."

Dow Chemical, No. 2 in the business, acquired a pharmaceutical operation. And many other chemical companies are also responding to the huge worldwide overcapacity in basic chemicals by diversifying. But the Celanese Corporation has marched to a different drummer, keeping a stubborn commitment to its core businesses. So far, its nonconformist strategy is paying off. After being the only major chemical company to lose money in 1982, Celanese will likely outperform the industry this year, and report record profits. But it is too soon for the company to rest on its laurels: Because the chemical industry is so cyclical, Celanese's failure to diversify could leave it especially vulnerable to the next downswing."
