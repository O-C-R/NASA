      "lead_paragraph": "ON the moon they have a problem: atomic waste shipped from earth and stored on the dark side is about to blow. ''We have magnetic energy of unprecedented violence,'' reports an officer in Moonbase Alpha, a sleekly modular outpost for 300 people on the lunar surface. One idea is to spread the stuff out, diffusing the explosive central mass. Nice try, but futile. ''The greatest step for mankind is about to look like a stumble in the dark,'' says Commander John Koenig, portrayed with furrow-browed intensity by Martin Landau. The blast sends the Moonbase Alpha crew, smartly costumed by Rudi Gernreich, leaping and rolling around the control center. They survive to wander the universe, never to return permanently to earth. But their show -- ''Space: 1999,'' which streaked through the syndication skies for 48 episodes from 1975 to 1977 before burning up in an atmosphere more attuned to slice-of-life ''message'' shows like ''All in the Family'' -- has touched down among us in new sets of videos and DVD's from A&E."

But more than a little of Sir Ernest Shackleton's adventuring spirit has found its way into the MaxiMog, a one-of-a-kind custom expedition vehicle that he and a team of dozens of experts built from the ground up over the last three years. He came up with the idea of a car -- he calls it the MaxiMog Global Expedition System -- that he could drive around the world while president for research and development, technology, at Walt Disney Imagineering, where he worked until last year overseeing more than 100 Imagineers, the term Disney coined for his designers 50 years ago. At Disney, Mr. Ferren was the master wizard of escapist fantasies, applying his gift for complex technologies throughout the Kingdom of the Mouse. Memorable Ferren experiences include stomach-pitching rides like the Tower of Terror's 13-story plunge and the skidding, engine-roaring Test Track developed with General Motors at Epcot Center. And now, the guru of high-tech thrills is primed for an adventure of his own. With his 12-foot high MaxiMog, Mr. Ferren, 48, stands as equipped as any explorer this side of NASA to venture into uncharted terrain. In terms of sheer brute prowess, this off-road vehicle is as macho as they come: it can pull its trailer up a 45-degree grade by engaging a high-performance drive system that powers all eight wheels. It can climb over three-foot boulders and traverse streams six feet deep; it can survey terrain for miles around by deploying a four-foot remote-controlled electric reconnaissance plane that sends back images, and whenever Mr. Ferren wants to check in with scientists or friends around the world, he can switch on a two-way video-conferencing system beamed up from the MaxiMog's own 50-foot pneumatic mast. Every contingency -- power, communications, navigation, medical support, hydraulics, climate control, safety -- has been met with state-of-the-art technology (there are heated and cooled drink holders next to the driver's seat and 1,900 lights)."

That is the belief of a group of NASA scientists who have been working on more direct ways to control machines, starting with jets and spacecraft. Speech recognition is one alternative, but it is not ideal for cockpits or other noisy places. So the scientists are attempting to show how gestures can link humans more directly to the devices they control. They recently demonstrated that electronic signals picked up from human muscles could be used to land a jetliner in a simulation. These kinds of controls could someday be used in things like video games as well."
