Noriega, assisted in attaching a 17-ton power assembly after it was lifted by a robot arm from the payload bay of the space shuttle Endeavour. Operating the arm from within the shuttle, a Canadian astronaut, Dr. Marc Garneau, moved the $600 million power unit to the top of the station, where the waiting spacewalkers helped guide it to its final position."

The designer was Alexander McQueen, and after extensive talks with Mr. De Sole, Gucci announced yesterday that it would acquire 51 percent of Mr. McQueen's business. It is a business that is hardly a cash cow. Sales of Mr. McQueen's eccentric ready-to-wear -- his recent collection featured a full-length skirt made of mussel shells -- are ''not large,'' Mr. De Sole admitted. ''We believe the potential is there,'' he said. Mr. McQueen now has one store in London; Mr. De Sole said he planned to open more in the obvious fashion capitals -- New York, Paris and Milan."

Her speaking voice is a tired contralto, and beneath a rainbow of lid-to-brow stage makeup, her left eye is flecked with blood: she spent the morning at the hospital having a piece of theater grit extracted by her favorite physician, the one she entrusts with her vocal cords. But Ms. Jett's ''Rocky Horror Show'' understudy won't inherit her dual roles as Columbia and Usherette, or that solo wail on guitar in ''The Time Warp,'' tonight. No one has ever called Ms. Jett a quitter. When 23 record companies declined to produce her first album, dismissing a leather-wrapped, guitar-slinging teenage girl as offensively unmarketable, she did it herself."
