He is the doll-size figure that swaggered into the American consciousness in his battle fatigues in 1964, the year that Ford Mustang, Diet Pepsi and Kellogg's Pop-Tarts also joined consumers' vocabularies. Now G.I. Joe, whose toy-store life began as a kind of Barbie for boys, is old enough to be a collectible. And with prices ranging from $75 to more than $4,000 for a rare 1967 figure in mint condition, old Joes are less likely to be played with than stared at under museum-quality lighting."

Eliot's ''Four Quartets.'' We pictured jaunts with our angelic sweethearts to various cultural meccas -- Florence, Paris -- where our shared experience of the glories of art would bring us that much closer. Then real life hit in the form of our firstborn, Sam, and all our romantic ideas went kerplop. True, for some years before his twin sister and brother were born, Sam liked nothing better than to pull all our books off the shelves -- he was eager, my husband said, to read our complete ''Remembrance of Things Past''. And, in an attempt to be tourists in our own backyard -- at that time Washington, D.C. -- we spent countless Saturdays at the Smithsonian."
