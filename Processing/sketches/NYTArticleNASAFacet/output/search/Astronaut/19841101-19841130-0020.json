The tributes, and the detailed coverage by the Soviet press agency Tass, reflected the close relations that developed between India and the Soviet Union under Mrs. Gandhi's rule. There was no immediate indication which Soviet leader would attend Mrs. Gandhi's funeral Saturday."

DISPLAYING A PHOTOgraph of Manhattan on one side of the screen and a photograph of the Statue of Liberty on the other, the computer operator easily copies the tourist icon, transferring it to a patch of open space in Midtown. He softens and slightly darkens the statue's edges. An observer of the newly created photograph (shown on page 45) would wonder what the Statue of Liberty and the similarly ''relocated'' Eiffel Tower and Transamerica Pyramid were doing in Midtown Manhattan. The computer is at the heart of a revolution in image making. It is now possible not only to make almost seamless composites of existing photographs and to alter images in such a way that the changes may not be detected, but - using mathematics instead of a camera - it is possible to create images that are nearly photographic in their realism. With the last technique, it might even be possible at some future date to ''recreate'' long-dead movie stars to appear in new movies."

This year, Mr. Percy has worked hard to win the support of the Republican right wing, tying himself closely to the economic policies of the Reagan Administration. Mr. Simon has mounted an appeal to blacks, liberal Democrats and moderate Republicans who have traditionally supported Mr. Percy. Iowa JepsenHarkin Senator Roger W. Jepsen, a 55- year-old Republican, is defending his seat against Representative Tom Harkin. Mr. Jepsen, faced with negative publicity about invoking a constitutional privilege to escape a traffic ticket and applying for membership in a ''health spa'' that was closed on prostitution charges, has depicted himself as a Senate leader and has relied upon visits by big-name Republicans. Mr. Harkin, 44, a Democrat with five terms in the House, has tried to hold the urban Democratic vote and his conservative base in western Iowa while attracting moderate Republicans and farmers.

If the Discovery gets away as planned, it will be the shortest interval, less than a month, between flights in the shuttle project. This will be the project's 14th flight and Discovery's second. A sister ship, the Challenger, landed here Oct. 13 after a seven-day flight."

Mr. Garn said last week that he had accepted an invitation from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to fly on the space shuttle ''at a mutally agreeable date.'' ''I'm still pinching myself,'' said Mr. Garn, who has been jogging 20 to 25 miles a week to keep ''in physical shape so there would be no question.'' As a Navy pilot and later an Air National Guard officer, the 52- year-old Senator has logged more than 10,000 hours aloft - more than all but one astronaut. Perhaps more to the point, Mr. Garn is head of the subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee that oversees NASA, and the agency will be asking Congress next year for more seed money for its $8 billion space station program and for added funds to improve the shuttle's reliability."

Sometimes the finder's name ensures a place in philatelic history. But, in the 145 years of stamp collecting, there have been relatively few such instances. Nearly a half million stamp issues have occurred since May, 1840 and untold billions of stamps printed. However, there remains an interesting aspect of the hobby that allows the pleasures of ''the search'' but more opportunity for results: freaks and oddities. Coupled with ''errors,'' freaks and oddities keep alive the stereotype of stamp collectors, who study their collection with a large magnifying glass."

Finally proving whether this is possible may be the only value of the Senator's far- fetched junket. Somehow it has become a chestnut of the space age that the Great Wall, stretching 3,750 miles, is the only man-made structure visible from space, even from the moon. The claim pops up, irrepressibly.

Pete Dawkins, who has since gone to Oxford, to Vietnam, to the Pentagon and to Wall Street, remembers his last Army- Navy game and his only Heisman Trophy. Dawkins is 46 years old now, so poised and so accomplished on the battlefield and in the classroom that journalists instinctively ask him about high political plans. Once known as Saint Peter at West Point because of his skills and his comportment, he is barely a year into civilian life as a securities executive after retiring as a brigadier general."
