The British composer Gustav Holst completed the work in 1916: an orchestral suite with a movement devoted to each of the seven planets then known, excluding Earth. That left Pluto, discovered only in 1930 (four years before Holst's death), out in the cold. Another British composer, Colin Matthews, supplied the missing movement, ''Pluto, the Renewer,'' in 2000. It has been recorded before, but Mr. Rattle's two-CD set, with the Berlin Philharmonic, draws particular attention to it, packaging it along with newly commissioned works, called ''Asteroids,'' by four prominent contemporary composers. And the release came just in time for the deflating announcement by the International Astronomical Union that Pluto was being demoted to the status of dwarf planet."
