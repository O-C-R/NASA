          "lead_paragraph": "As early as 1997, a senior NASA engineer warned that hardened foam popping off the external fuel tank on the Columbia shuttle had caused significant damage to the ceramic tiles protecting the vehicle from re-entry temperatures. The warning was sure to receive new scrutiny after NASA said yesterday that its investigation into the cause of the destruction of the space shuttle on Saturday was focusing on damage to tiles that may have been caused by foam or ice or a combination of the two. NASA officials also acknowledged that they might have underestimated the potential seriousness of damage sustained by the tiles when the shuttle lifted off. Gregory N. Katnik, a NASA engineer at Cape Canaveral, said in a report dated Dec. 23, 1997, that the Columbia had sustained damage to more than 300 tiles on a recent flight. The inspection after a Columbia mission in 1997 showed that the tiles had sustained damage that was ''not normal,'' Mr. Katnik said. In a number of other shuttle flights, tile damage from falling foam also caused smaller amounts of damage, but NASA decided that over all, the problem did not threaten the survival of its spacecraft. Now the agency is re-examining that assumption as it struggles to explain the mystery of how the Columbia broke up as it soared back into the atmosphere. Ron D. Dittemore, the shuttle program manager, told a news conference yesterday that damage to the tiles was the leading focus of the investigation, but he cautioned that what appeared to be the most likely solution might prove illusory as the complex inquiry moved ahead. ''There's some other event; there's some other missing link that we don't have yet that is contributing to this temperature increase,'' Mr. Dittemore said. ''It's a mystery to us.'' But new evidence that surfaced yesterday suggested that damage to the tiles may have been more severe and covered a wider area than first estimated. A videotape made by a team of NASA scientists at the Jan. 16 liftoff appeared to show a bushel-basket-sized chunk of debris breaking away from the external fuel tank and striking the fragile protective tiles on the underside of the left wing. A NASA analysis suggested the impact could have damaged a swath of tile as large as 7 inches wide and 32 inches long, according to an agency memorandum made public yesterday. The possibility that damaged tile could have caused the ship to break apart when it re-entered the atmosphere was supported by several outside experts in aerodynamics. They said in interviews that even slightly damaged tiles -- perhaps only roughened or cracked -- could generate turbulence near the tiles during the tremendous speeds of re-entry, creating potentially dangerous heating of Columbia's aluminum skin. ''There is a possibility that just damage to the tile to the point that they are rougher could create increased heating,'' said Dr. Michael Holden, director of the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center in New York, which does aerodynamic testing of the shuttles. ''If it went turbulent, you'd be in more jeopardy,'' possibly affecting the survival of the entire craft, Dr. Holden said. While NASA has had trouble working out the details of how the foam impact could have led to the breakup, the accumulating evidence could force the agency to alter its initial determination that the damage seen on the Columbia was not significant, said Dr. Edward Crawley, chairman of the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's possible that more insulation fell off than they thought,'' Dr. Crawley said. ''It's possible that it hit in a way that caused more damage than their model suggested.'' But it is also possible, Dr. Crawley said, that ''there's still sort of a missing event here'' -- the link that will make a new pattern, and a new theory for the catastrophe, emerge. The newly released NASA video shows a whitish object soaring backward, striking the Columbia's left wing and bursting into a cloud of dust. The oblong chunk appears to be the size of the shuttle's astronaut hatch, which measures about 40 inches by 40 inches. Mr. Dittemore said NASA's analysis determined that the piece probably weighed just under three pounds, though he said that new and more intensive work was being done that could revise that number. With a range of assumptions about the exact angle at which the piece ricocheted off the spacecraft, he said, NASA determined that anywhere from a single tile to a swath 32 inches long could have been damaged. He said that NASA's computer model generally predicted more damage than would actually take place. The debris was first noticed the day after the shuttle liftoff when engineers were reviewing film. But Mr. Dittemore said no one on NASA's study team initially thought the damage posed a serious concern. ''At the time I was not aware of anybody that had those feelings, at least to the point where they would want to come forward and identify that there's still something that they think remains undone,'' Mr. Dittemore said. Reports prepared during the flight of the Columbia were released yesterday by NASA. They showed that the falling debris occurred 81 seconds into the flight and was first identified the day after the liftoff. ''At approximately 81 seconds Mission Elapsed Time, a large light-colored piece of debris was seen to originate from an area near the ET/Orbiter forward attach bipod,'' the report said. ''The debris appeared to move outboard and then fall aft along the left side of the Orbiter fuselage, striking the leading edge of the left wing.'' The report said that more detail would come from analysis of high-speed tracking films. A report two days later said analysis of the films could not identify individual tiles, but it concluded, ''no indications of larger scale damage were noted.'' On Jan. 28, a report said that a study of films and analysis of temperatures onboard the spacecraft indicated a potential for significant damage to the tiles. But it concluded that there was ''no safety of flight issue.'' But the idea that somehow the tile was extremely vulnerable to damage received support from the earlier report on similar damage. In 1997, Mr. Katnik, the senior NASA engineer, worked in a division that analyzed data from inspections of the shuttles. He is now a technical manager in the Space Shuttle Program Launch Integration Office at the Kennedy Space Center. He said on the 1997 mission the shuttle sustained a significant amount of damage to its heat tiles. In a normal mission, a shuttle will sustain damage to up to 40 tiles because of ice dropping from the external tank and hitting the tiles, Mr. Katnik reported. But on that mission, he said, ''the pattern of hits did not follow aerodynamic expectations, and the number, size and severity of the hits were abnormal.'' Inspectors counted 308 hits. Of those, 132 were ''greater than one inch,'' Mr. Katnik said. Some of the hits measured up to 15 inches long with depths of up to one-and-a-half inches. The tiles were only two inches deep, so the largest hits penetrated three-quarters of the way into the tiles, he noted. The damaged tiles were mostly around the shuttle's nose. After the mission, more than 100 tiles were taken off because ''they were irreparable,'' Mr. Katnik said. The report went on to speculate as to why the foam dropped off. As it turned out, to be environmentally friendly, NASA had eliminated the use of Freon in foam production, Mr. Katnik reported. The Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., later concluded that the absence of Freon led to the detachment of the foam. While the formulation was later improved, the episode revealed potentially dangerous new ways in which tiles could be damaged. ''The tiles still had plenty of material left,'' Mr. Katnik said in an interview yesterday. ''There was a margin of safety.'' Nonetheless, he said, the shuttle ''was coming back with an irritating amount of damage that we had to repair.''",

        "story": "NASA launched a nationwide campaign to recruit elementary, middle, and high school classroom teachers for its astronaut corps, building on the legacy of its Teacher in Space Project of 1985. NASA had selected Christa McAuliffe and Barbara R. Morgan from among 12,000 applicants for the first project, which had ended tragically when Space Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after launching on 28 January 1986 with McAuliffe on board. McAuliffe\u2019s backup Barbara R. Morgan had rejoined NASA in 1998 to train and qualify as a mission specialist. In December 2002, NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe had announced Morgan\u2019s assignment to a November assembly mission to the ISS. NASA planned for the new recruitment campaign to extend the legacy of McAuliffe and the work of Morgan, making future educator- astronauts as much a part of the astronaut corps as test pilots, engineers, physicians, astronomers, geologists, and scientists from other disciplines. To accomplish this goal, NASA planned to train teachers with proven technical skills, making them eligible for missions ranging from 12-day Shuttle flights to months-long residencies aboard the ISS. Because of their ability to communicate with students in the classroom more effectively than traditional NASA astronauts, the educator-astronauts would be a critical part of an educational initiative to \u201cmake math and science as inspiring to youngsters as pop music and sports.\u201d(Mark Carreau, \u201cNASA Seeking a Few Good Teachers,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 22 January 2003.)",

A report two days later said analysis of the films could not identify individual tiles, but it concluded, ''no indications of larger scale damage were noted.'' On Jan. 28, a report said that a study of films and analysis of temperatures onboard the spacecraft indicated a potential for significant damage to the tiles. But it concluded that there was ''no safety of flight issue.'' But the idea that somehow the tile was extremely vulnerable to damage received support from the earlier report on similar damage. In 1997, Mr. Katnik, the senior NASA engineer, worked in a division that analyzed data from inspections of the shuttles. He is now a technical manager in the Space Shuttle Program Launch Integration Office at the Kennedy Space Center. He said on the 1997 mission the shuttle sustained a significant amount of damage to its heat tiles. In a normal mission, a shuttle will sustain damage to up to 40 tiles because of ice dropping from the external tank and hitting the tiles, Mr. Katnik reported. But on that mission, he said, ''the pattern of hits did not follow aerodynamic expectations, and the number, size and severity of the hits were abnormal.'' Inspectors counted 308 hits. Of those, 132 were ''greater than one inch,'' Mr. Katnik said. Some of the hits measured up to 15 inches long with depths of up to one-and-a-half inches. The tiles were only two inches deep, so the largest hits penetrated three-quarters of the way into the tiles, he noted. The damaged tiles were mostly around the shuttle's nose. After the mission, more than 100 tiles were taken off because ''they were irreparable,'' Mr. Katnik said. The report went on to speculate as to why the foam dropped off. As it turned out, to be environmentally friendly, NASA had eliminated the use of Freon in foam production, Mr. Katnik reported. The Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., later concluded that the absence of Freon led to the detachment of the foam. While the formulation was later improved, the episode revealed potentially dangerous new ways in which tiles could be damaged. ''The tiles still had plenty of material left,'' Mr. Katnik said in an interview yesterday. ''There was a margin of safety.'' Nonetheless, he said, the shuttle ''was coming back with an irritating amount of damage that we had to repair.''",

The crewRussian cosmonaut Nikolai M. Budarin and American astronauts Kenneth D. Bowersox and Donald R. Pettithad served at the outpost for 73 days, and NASA had scheduled their return to Earth on Shuttle Atlantis for 1 March. However, in the wake of the Columbia disaster, NASA had grounded all Shuttles indefinitely. Although the suspension of Shuttle flights did not place the ISS crew in danger, it did affect the schedule of space station construction and interrupted NASA\u2019s plan to install a high-speed gyroscope at the station in March, to replace one that had broken down in June 2002. With only three operational gyroscopes, the ISS would continue to drift, but NASA did not consider the matter a time-critical problem.(Todd Ackerman, \u201cCargo Craft Resupplies Outpost Crew Hanging in Orbit,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 5 February 2003; NASA, \u201cSpaceflight 2003: International Space Station Goals and Objectives,\u201d http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/reports/2003/iss.html (accessed 13 November 2009).)",

NASA\u2019s Mission Control lost communication with Columbia at 9:00 a.m. (EST) and immediately switched to the contingency plan to preserve all flight-activity information. NASA had scheduled the landing for 9:16 a.m. (EST). NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe issued a statement describing all the steps NASA had taken after the loss of the Shuttle. NASA officials had spoken with President George W. Bush and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge; met with family members of the crew; assembled an internal mishap investigation team; and appointed a mishap investigation board. The board comprised an external group of people independent from NASA, charged with examining all the information that Mission Control had locked down when it lost communication with Columbia.(NASA, \u201cNASA Statement on Loss of Communications with Columbia,\u201d news release 03-030, 1 February 2003, ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/2003/03-030.txt (accessed 15 July 2008); NASA, \u201cStatement by NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe,\u201d news release 03-032, 1 February 2003, ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/2003/03-032.txt (accessed 15 July 2008); Washington Post, \u201cThe Columbia Catastrophe,\u201d 2 February 2003.)",

The scientists speculated that the observable counterpart signified the existence of an unobservable, catastrophic burst of gamma rays, unleashing as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun does in 10 billion years. The New Technology Telescope and the W. M. Keck Telescope, added to the HST in 1997, had enabled scientists to make the observation. According to Gerald J. Fishman of Marshall Space Flight Center, the lead investigator of NASA\u2019s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, astronomers could not overestimate the significance of the find, even if the visible- light phenomenon was only an indicator of another unobservable phenomenon. \u201cThis [discovery] opens up a whole new era in GRB research,\u201d Fishman explained. \u201cWe now know that it is possible to see the fading optical emission by rapid follow-up observations with powerful telescopes. With several more of these, we should be able to narrow the models of what could be causing these gigantic outbursts.\u201d(NASA, \u201cHubble Tracks the Fading Optical Counterpart of a Gamma-Ray Burst,\u201d news release 97-63, 1 April 1997.)",

        "story": "Astronauts aboard Columbia, consulting with NASA ground support, decided to cut short their planned 16-day mission because of the potential for an explosion in the Shuttle\u2019s electronic generator. NASA decided to abort the mission after the crew had attempted for two days to fix the balky generator. Despite the fact that the Shuttle\u2019s two other generators could provide enough power for the Shuttle, NASA\u2019s procedure required the Shuttle\u2019s return, to prevent subsequent problems. Space Shuttle Program Manager Thomas W. Holloway clarified that the astronauts faced no imminent danger and that terminating the mission was a precaution rather than an emergency. \u201cThe conservative thing to do is land on Tuesday,\u201d Holloway said at a news conference. Columbia\u2019s early return to Earth in Mission STS-83 was only the third time in the history of the Shuttle program that NASA had ended a mission early. The astronauts had time to complete only a few of the planned 33 experiments on the mission, which cost nearly US$500 million.(William Harwood, \u201cShuttle Flight Cut Short as Risk Persists,\u201d Washington Post, 7 April 1997; Warren Leary, \u201cPower Problem on Shuttle Forces a Tuesday Landing,\u201d New York Times, 7 April 1997; Associated Press, \u201cDeteriorating Generator Cuts Short Mission,\u201d 6 April 1997.)",

The CAIB conducted the test in preparation for an official test with panels composed of reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC), a material two and one-half times more resilient than fiberglass. In addition to determining whether foam could damage the fiberglass, the CAIB intended the test to calibrate the mechanism for testing the RCC without using up scarce RCC samples.(John Schwartz and Matthew L.

Halsell Jr. called Mission STS-94 a \u201conce-in-a-career opportunity\u201d for the seven-person crew, the same crew that had embarked upon Mission STS-83 in April 1997. NASA had cut short Mission STS-83 because of a fuel cell problem. The reflight gave NASA officials and the Shuttle crew a chance to undertake the experiments planned for the original mission, including testing hardware and procedures planned for the International Space Station. NASA was able to launch Columbia just 84 days after bringing the Shuttle home, at a cost of about 20 percent of the amount needed to set off a new Shuttle mission. The crew planned to carry out the original 33 experiments over the course of the 16-day science mission. Mission STS-94, NASA clarified, involved the same vehicle, crew, Microgravity Science Laboratory payload, and experiment schedule as the recalled mission. The mission was the first in the 36-year history of unpiloted spaceflight in which the same crew flew together in space more than once.(NASA, \u201cColumbia and Crew Ready for Reflight of Microgravity Sciences Laboratory-1 Payload on Mission STS-94,\u201d news release J97-21, June 1997; William Harwood, \u201cShuttle Begins Second Attempt at Mission,\u201d Washington Post, 2 July 1997; Warren Leary, \u201cShuttle Roars Aloft To Complete Mission Interrupted in April,\u201d New York Times, 2 July 1997; Associated Press, \u201cSpace Shuttle Blasts Off on Repeat Science Mission,\u201d 1 July 1997.)",

        "story": "NASA announced that images provided by the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS), which NASA had launched in December 1998, showed new evidence that extra- planetary systems contain water. In particular, astronomers had studied the giant IRC+10216 star, also known as CW Leonis, and had located water vapor surrounding the celestial body. Scientists had never considered the giant star, located some 500 light-years from Earth, as a likely host of water because of its high levels of carbon. Gary Melnick of the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics led the SWAS study, which concluded that the most viable explanation for the \u201csubstantial concentrations of water vapor\u201d around the star was that the star\u2019s gravity had pulled the water vapor from the icy surfaces of nearby comets. The discovery had broad implications for scientists\u2019 theories about how Earth might eventually end. \u201cWe think we are witnessing the type of apocalypse that will ultimately befall our own planetary system,\u201d said one SWAS researcher. \u201cSeveral billion years from now, the Sun will become a giant star and its power output will increase five thousand fold. As the luminosity of the Sun increases, a wave of water vaporization will spread outwards through the solar system, starting with Earth\u2019s oceans and extending well beyond the orbit of Neptune.\u201d(Gary J. Melnick et al., \u201cDiscovery of Water Vapour Around IRC+10216 as Evidence for Comets Orbiting Another Star,\u201d Nature 412, no. 6843 (12 July 2001): 160163; NASA, \u201cStellar Apocalypse Yields First Evidence of Water-Bearing Worlds Beyond Our Solar System,\u201d news release 01-140, 11 July 2001.)",

Bush administration\u2019s 2004 Vision for Space Exploration (VSE). Among other things, the VSE had mandated that NASA return to the Moon by 2020. The ESMD\u2019s Constellation Program was developing vehicles, such as the Orion CEV and the Ares-I crew launch vehicle (CLV), to implement the VSE. NASA had proposed that the FY 2009 budget request include US$3.5 billion in funding for the ESMD. During the hearing, Subcommittee Chair Mark E. Udall (D-CO) expressed concern that space exploration projects were underfunded and might become a drain on NASA\u2019s resources. Furthermore, Cristina T.

President Bush\u2019s new policy called for the completion of the ISS by 2010, the subsequent retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, and the development of a replacement Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) capable of conducting human spaceflight missions by 2014. President Bush stated that he would seek US$1 billion in funding over the next five years to begin research on the new vehicle program. In addition, he called for robotic exploration of the Moon by 2008, followed by crewed missions to the Moon in 2020 and, eventually, astronaut missions to Mars, directing NASA to divert US$(Kelly Young, \u201cFirst Woman Directs Launch,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 31 January 2001.)",

Witnesses identified several key weaknesses in NASA\u2019s management of its personnel, which could have affected safety issues in the Space Shuttle Program. Allen Li of GAO, which had issued a report in 2001 about NASA workforce issues, noted that NASA had faced substantial challenges in attracting and retaining a highly skilled workforce. Therefore, key areas of NASA\u2019s programs had an insufficient number of qualified workers, and the remainder of the staff showed signs of overwork and fatigue. In response to the 2001 report, NASA had developed new systems for monitoring such issues, and Li said that NASA had made noteworthy progress. However, NASA was still requesting congressional approval of personnel reforms that would help ameliorate the situation, reforms that would give NASA the authority to streamline the hiring process and the ability to offer larger recruitment and retention bonuses. Marcia S. Smith of the Congressional Research Service provided the CAIB with a history of NASA\u2019s budget situation but remarked that the CAIB would have difficulty tying budgetary changes directly to safety issues and Shuttle operations. Russell D. Turner, the former CEO of the prime contractor for Shuttle operations, United Space Alliance, defended the work of the firms involved in the Space Shuttle Program.(Tom Shoop, \u201cNASA Needs Management Overhaul, Shuttle Investigators Told,\u201d Government Executive, 13 June 2003.)",

The Young Panel had urged the company to make structural changes to correct quality-control problems at Astronautics, the unit responsible for Atlas, Titan, and Athena rocket development. In response to the panel\u2019s recommendation to divide the two tasks of product assurance and mission success, Astronautics President G. Thomas Marsh appointed John P. Mari as Vice President of Product Assurance and Roman Matherne as Vice President for Mission Success. Marsh named John Parker, President of the former Mission Success and Product Assurance Section, to head the operations post in Lockheed Martin\u2019s VentureStarTM Program, which the company hoped to develop into a future reusable launch vehicle with the potential to replace the Space Shuttle. Marsh appointed Joel S. Porter as Vice President for Business Development and Advanced Programs for Astronautics, succeeding Matthew B. Foster, who resigned. Other changes at Astronautics included the appointment of Claude McAnally as Vice President of Operations; the appointment of Grover W. Hall Jr. as Vice President of Technical Operations; and the separation of Technical Operations from Manufacturing Operations to better delineate responsibility and accountability, according to the recommendations of the Young Panel. Lockheed tasked Gareth D. Flora, under Marsh\u2019s supervision, with developing, managing, and improving subcontract management. In addition, Flora became responsible for ensuring that the company properly implemented the recommendations of the investigating team, as well as those of a separate U.S. Air Force review of the aerospace industry.(Jeffrey Leib, \u201cLockheed Replaces Key Staff in Astronautics Unit,\u201d Denver Post (CO), 21 September 1999.)",

        "story": "NASA scientists lost contact with the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft as it entered its Martian orbit and disappeared behind the planet, a little less than a year after the launch of its Mars mission in December 1998. Mars Surveyor Project Manager John B. McNamee said that the orbit-insertion burn, a 16-minute-long burn to slow the spacecraft down as it enters orbit, had begun on time. The team of NASA scientists observed 5 minutes of the burn before the craft went behind Mars. At that point, the craft stopped communicating. Communication did not resume at the time the team expected the craft to reappear from the far side of the planet. McNamee reported that the latest navigation results showed that the craft had entered its orbit lower than his team had planned, indicating that NASA\u2019s navigation predictions at the tracking station may have been incorrect. Carl B. Pilcher, Science Director for Solar System Exploration at NASA Headquarters, commented that, although losing the spacecraft was very serious, the loss was \u201cnot devastating to the Mars Surveyor Program as a whole,\u201d because the mission of Mars Polar Lander, scheduled to arrive at Mars two months after Mars Climate Orbiter, was independent of that of Orbiter.(NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \u201cNASA\u2019s Mars Climate Orbiter Believed To Be Lost,\u201d news release, 23 September 1999, http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/99/mcolost.html (accessed 3 March 2008); Reuters, \u201cNASA Loses Contact with Mars Orbiter,\u201d 23 September 1999.)",

Previously, many scientists had agreed that a large-scale eventthe Permian-Triassic extinctionhad occurred approximately 250 million years ago. However, they had debated about whether volcanic activity or the impact of an extraterrestrial object such as a meteor had caused the event. A team of scientists led by Luann Becker of University of California at Santa Barbara reported the discovery of strong evidence for the impact theorypart of a meteorite or comet, nearly 6 miles (10 kilometers) in diameter, buried in sediment off the coast of Australia. Based on analysis of the object\u2019s age and mineral composition, the team believed that the object might have caused the Permian-Triassic extinctionthe extinction of 90 percent of marine species and 70 percent of land species. NASA and the National Science Foundation had funded the scientists, who cautioned that their findings did not prove definitively that extraterrestrial impact had caused the extinction event.(Guy Gugliotta, \u201cImpact Crater Labeled Clue to Mass Extinction,\u201d Washington Post, 14 May 2004; Richard A.

        "story": "Harold W. Gehman Jr. delivered the CAIB\u2019s final report to NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe, presenting its findings and recommendations. The CAIB found that a 1.7-pound (0.77-kilogram) piece of foam insulation, traveling at more than 500 miles (804.6 kilometers) per hour, had damaged Columbia\u2019s wing during launch, ultimately leading to its disintegration during reentry. The report stated that management decisions during Columbia\u2019s flight reflected missed opportunities, ineffective communication channels, flawed analysis, and ineffective leadership. When cameras tracking Columbia provided two grainy images showing the foam striking the wing, engineers had immediately begun to discuss obtaining further images of the Shuttle or initiating a spacewalk to check for damages. However, mission managers had \u201cadjourned for a holiday weekend and did not discuss the foam strike.\u201d Upon returning to work on 21 January, the managers had assessed the strike as a postlanding maintenance problem, because smaller foam strikes had left harmless dents in Shuttles during all previous missions. The CAIB\u2019s Executive Director John L. Barry remarked that, among NASA\u2019s competing goals of maintaining costs and meeting schedules, safety had lost out. The Board directly criticized Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe for increasing pressure to meet a February 2004 launch deadline, thereby creating a pattern similar to that which had led to the Challenger disaster in 1986. The CAIB recommended that NASA implement 15 actions before the next Shuttle flight, including creating an independent safety-and-engineering organization to help establish satisfactory safety margins. Upon receiving the Board\u2019s final report, O\u2019Keefe reiterated NASA\u2019s intention to comply fully with the recommendations.(NASA, \u201cNASA Administrator Accepts Columbia Accident Report,\u201d news release 03-276, 26 August 2003, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/aug/HQ_03276_AOK_Acpt_CAIB.html (accessed 29 December 2008); Mark Carreau, \u201cColumbia Accident Board Casts Wide Net of Blame,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 27 August 2003; Kathy Sawyer and Eric Pianin, \u201cReport Blames Flawed NASA Culture for Tragedy,\u201d Washington Post, 27 August 2003. 504 Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 598; Justin Ray, \u201cResupply Ship Bound for the International Space Station,\u201d Spaceflight Now, 28 August 2003.)",

Using data from satellites and 7,200 weather stations worldwide, NASA and NOAA scientists had found that the global mean surface air temperature had increased by 1oF (0.6oC) during the 20th century. However, temperatures had not increased consistently but had undergone successive periods of warming (from 1900 to 1940), cooling (1940 to 1965), and warming again (1965 to 2000). The evidence also indicated that these temperature changes had not been uniform throughout Earth. For example, although the average surface air temperature in the United States had increased during the latter part of the 20th century, it had remained at a level comparable to average U.S. temperatures during the 1930s. In addition, the researchers had discovered evidence that humans had influenced surface air temperatures on a local scale in large urban areas, suburbs, and even in small towns. However, the data also indicated that this effect had been of modest magnitude and might reflect problems with data measurement.(J.

The size of a domed football stadium, the vessel was constructed of ultra-thin plastic material, enabling it to float above 99 percent of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Scientists controlled the research craft from the ground, hoping that if it succeeded, this new type of balloon would provide a cost-effective method of gathering data. However, after a launch delay of several weeks, because of turbulent weather, the research balloon lasted aloft only a few hours before a leak forced it back to the ground. Once the balloon had reached 85,000 feet (26,000 meters), the flight controllers initiated a controlled descent, minimizing further damage to the craft and to the research instruments aboard. Engineers were optimistic that they could fix the balloon and that, once they had repaired and deployed it, the balloon would fly higher and longer than any previous research balloon. However, when the balloon landed approximately 132 miles (212 kilometers) away from its takeoff site, the launch-station director and crew remained uncertain of the nature and extent of the problem.(NASA, \u201cNASA Aborts Space Research Balloon Flight,\u201d news release 01-28, 26 February 2001; Associated Press, \u201cLeak Forces NASA Balloon To Land,\u201d 25 February 2001; Associated Press, \u201cGiant Balloon Launched After Long Delay,\u201d 24 February 2001.)",

The splashdown marked the end of a 2.2 billion-mile journey for Mir. Witnesses in Fiji reported seeing streaks of gold and silver lights across the sky when Mir fell, but nobody reported any damage from pieces of the falling space station. U.S. officials at the Pentagon tracked the descent, while Japan\u2019s public safety chief urged people to stay indoors to avoid falling debris. Anatoly Y. Solovyev, a Russian cosmonaut who had spent 651 days aboard Mir, remarked that he was sad to see the end of the pathbreaking space station: \u201cAn entire era of our Soviet space program is ending, into which we invested not only our money, but what is more important, our intellectual potential.\u201d Once Mir had descended safely, officials of the Russian Space Agency praised the precise sequence of maneuvers that had brought the space station safely from orbit.(Patrick E.

        "story": "Scientists from California Institute of Technology announced that they had used NASA\u2019s HST to measure the true size of an orbiting, planet-like body beyond Pluto. The sphere was the most distant object that a telescope had measured within Earth\u2019s solar system. Like its neighbor Pluto, the object, which is nearly 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) from Earth, lies in the Kuiper Belt, an icy debris field that extends 7 billion miles (11.3 billion kilometers) beyond the orbit of Neptune. Using the HST, scientists Michael E. Brown and Chadwick A. Trujillo were able to determine several properties of the sphere, including its diameter of 780 miles (1,250 kilometers). Although too small to be a planet, the sphere, which Brown and Trujillo named Quaoarafter a creation deity of the Native American Tongva peoplehas planet-like traits that Pluto lacks. For example, Brown and Trujillo found that Quaoar has a circular orbit around the Sun and is in the same plane as the other planets in Earth\u2019s solar system. Brown and Trujillo announced their findings at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society\u2019s Division for Planetary Sciences.(NASA, \u201cHubble Spots an Icy World Far Beyond Pluto,\u201d news release 02-190, 7 October 2002; Usha Lee McFarling, \u201cPluto\u2019s Not So Alone Out There, It Appears,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 8 October 2002.)",

The 510-kilogram (1,124.36-pound) craft was a joint mission of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT); the French space agency (Centre National d\u2019Études Spatiales\u2014CNES); the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and NASA. EUMETSAT\u2019s aim was to continue the data-collection mission that NASA and CNES had begun in 1992 with their ocean topography experiment, the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, and had continued with the 2001 launch of Jason 1. Jason 2 had five instruments\u2014improved versions of those aboard Jason 1\u2014 that could chart the topography of the ocean\u2019s surface, the speed and direction of the ocean\u2019s current, and the amount of solar energy the ocean stores. Scientists hoped to use these measurements to track global climate change, to hone their predictions of hurricane intensity, and to improve their understanding of currents, eddies, and tides. The project partners had scheduled Jason 2 to fly in tandem with Jason 1 for approximately six months, while engineers calibrated Jason 2\u2019s instruments. Afterwards, the two spacecraft would travel in separate orbits, doubling the global satellite coverage.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 656, 1 July 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx656.html (accessed 24 April 2011); NASA, \u201cNASA Launches Ocean Satellite To Keep a Weather, Climate Eye Open,\u201d news release 08-154, 20 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08154_OSTM-Jason-2_Launch.html (accessed 21 April 2011).)",

After conducting a complicated landing sequence and arriving safely on the surface of the asteroid Eros, the NEAR spacecraft relayed its signal to excited scientists on Earth. Called the \u201cSurprisingly Sturdy Little Spacecraft\u201d by the New York Times, NEAR survived its landing mission, surprising space officials and enthusiasts. NEAR had already spent a year orbiting the Eros asteroid, when the craft had run low on fuel. NASA\u2019s mission team directed it to land on the asteroid\u2019s surface. After NEAR\u2019s successful landing, mission managers determined that the spacecraft merited additional funding. Although the details about where NEAR would touch down remained in doubt until the last moment, the craft had landed at a location ideal for Earth controllers to send and receive signals, facilitating an extended mission.(NASA, \u201cAsteroid Mission Not Yet \u2018NEAR\u2019 an End,\u201d news release 01-20, 14 February 2001; Warren Leary, \u201cMission Extended for Surprisingly Sturdy Little Spacecraft,\u201d New York Times, 15 February 2001; Associated Press, \u201cNASA Adds 10 Days to Asteroid Mission,\u201d 15 February 2001.)",

Scientists in NASA\u2019s Earth Science Enterprise believed that GPS might prove especially useful in the area of natural hazard monitoring, providing farmers with images of their land in the event of a tornado, fire, or other disaster. The pathbreaking agreement resulted from the activities of the Commercial Technology Office at JPL, which focused on exploring new ways that technologies developed by American space programs could benefit other American industries.(NASA, \u201cNASA Satellite Technology Goes Down on the Farm,\u201d news release 01-62, 8 May 2001.)",

        "story": "NASA researchers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, announced a plan to collaborate with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, to explore the potential of the substance Aerogel, which has tremendous insulating capabilities. Scientists said that they were optimistic that they could manipulate the material, rendering it transparent and, therefore, especially useful in constructing energy-efficient windows for homes and automobiles. During the 1930s, a researcher at Stanford University had discovered Aerogel, often called frozen smoke because of its hazy appearance. NASA engineers had used Aerogel as an insulating agent aboard Mars Pathfinder in 1996. Although the substance is the lightest solid known⎯only three times the density of air, a block of Aerogel weighing less than 1 pound (0.5 kilograms) can support 0.5 tons (450 kilograms or 0.45 tonnes). Aerogel\u2019s large internal surface area, which disperses heat throughout its structure, causes the material\u2019s extreme insulating capability⎯a 1-inch-thick (2.5-centimeter-thick) Aerogel window would offer the same insulation value as 15 panes of glass. John M. Horack, Assistant Laboratory Director for Space and Science Communications at MSFC, called the development of Aerogel \u201ca great example of how NASA space research generates scientific knowledge that can be used to improve the quality of life on Earth.\u201d(NASA, \u201cNASA Research in Space May Redesign Household Windows,\u201d news release 97-34, 6 March 1997. 215 Warren E.

        "story": "NASA Administer Daniel S. Goldin praised the Clinton administration\u2019s budget proposal for 1998 as a sign that NASA\u2019s deep budget cuts were leveling off. NASA had braced itself for a budget as low as US$13.1 billion, and, therefore, found President William J. Clinton\u2019s US$13.5 billion proposal a pleasant surprise. The request still entailed a US$200 million budget cut, and Congress might reduce the budget further. Nevertheless, Goldin responded to the proposed budget exuberantly, exclaiming, \u201cHoly mackerel⎯this is a great program,\u201d and remarking that for the first time during his five-year tenure, NASA could hope for budgetary stability. The proposal also projected that NASA\u2019s budget in 2000 would be approximately US$13.2 billion, rather than the US$11.6 billion forecast in previous Clinton administration proposals. NASA planned to absorb the small reduction in funding by increasing efficiency, especially in the Shuttle program, having recently transferred management of the program to the privately held United Space Alliance. NASA officials believed that NASA could continue sending up seven or eight Shuttle missions annually, if budget trends continued to stabilize. On the day of the budget announcement, however, a NASA advisory panel warned once again that a drastic decrease in the Shuttle\u2019s funding would compromise its safety. Nevertheless, Goldin maintained that the proposal would allow NASA to continue fostering \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d science.(Anne Eisele, \u201cBudget Plan Brings Stability by 2000,\u201d Space News, 10−16 February 1997; Larry Wheeler, \u201cNASA Makes Do on Slimmer Budget, Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 7 February 1997; Sean Holton, \u201cNASA Cheers Budget that Cuts Agency Only a Bit,\u201d Orlando Sentinel (FL), 7 February 1997.)",

A professor at Johns Hopkins University, Giacconi had been the first scientist to discover a source of x-rays outside Earth\u2019s solar system and the first to prove that the universe contained background radiation of x-ray light. In addition, many astronomers believed that x-ray sources Giacconi had discovered contained black holes. Giacconi had also been responsible for the conception and design of the first x-ray satellite and the first operating x-ray telescope. Together with Harvey Tananbaum, he had proposed the design of the x-ray telescope that eventually became NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory. Moreover, Giacconi had been the first Director of the Hubble Space Telescope Science Institute and the Principal Investigator for the Chandra Ultra-Deep Survey, which had obtained the deepest x-ray exposures with a millionth-second observation.(NASA, \u201cNobel Physics in Physics Awarded to Astronomer for NASA-Funded Research,\u201d news release 02-197, 8 October 2002; Nobel Foundation, \u201cAdvanced Information on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2002,\u201d news release, 8 October 2002, http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2002/phyadv02.pdf (accessed 17 October 2008). 306 Gwyneth K.

ESA had designed the satellite, and Italy\u2019s Alenia Spazio had developed it, with support from more than 30 European firms. INTEGRAL would study dense objects that are sources of high-energy radiation, such as neutron stars and black holes. Project scientists hoped that INTEGRAL would produce images that would help confirm the presence of black holes at the center of galaxies, beginning with the Milky Way. INTEGRAL had two main instruments for analyzing gamma-ray sources: the Spectrometer on INTEGRAL, or SPI spectrometer, and the Imager on Board the INTEGRAL Satellite, or IBIS imager. The spectrometer and imager had an extremely sharp angular resolution, enabling them to conduct spectral analyses with an energy resolution 40 times better than that provided by any previous satellite. INTEGRAL also carried an x-ray imager and a charged-coupled device (CCD) imager that operated within the visible spectrum waveband. Using the combined data from the four instruments, project scientists would be able to make simultaneous observations of high-energy phenomena, from visible light to gamma rays.(ESA, \u201cEurope Opens a Window onto a Violent Universe,\u201d ESA news release 66-2002, 17 October 2002, http://www.esa.int/esaCP/ESAKXQTHN6D_index.0.html (accessed 2 February 2010).)",

It is comforting to think that something so voracious is so far away. But there are times when physicists wish that they could take a closer look.

Parsons had begun his career with NASA in 1990. He had served in numerous positions, including Director of NASA\u2019s Stennis Space Center (SSC), Launch Site Support Manager, Manager of the Space Station Hardware Integration Office, Chief of Operations of the Propulsion Test Directorate, SSP Manager, and Deputy Director of NASA\u2019s JSC. NASA had selected former astronaut Robert D. Cabana as the new Director of NASA\u2019S KSC. Cabana, who had completed his astronaut training in 1986, had flown on four Space Shuttle missions: STS-41 in October 1990, STS-53 in December 1992, STS-65 in July 1994, and STS-88 in December 1988. Additionally, he had served as Director of NASA\u2019s SSC, Deputy Director of NASA\u2019s JSC, Chief of NASA\u2019s Astronaut Office, Manager of International Operations of the ISS Program, Director of NASA\u2019s Human Spaceflight Program in Russia, Deputy Director of the ISS Program, and Director of Flight Crew Operations.(NASA, \u201cCabana To Succeed Parsons as Kennedy Space Center Director,\u201d news release 08-249, 30 September 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/sep/HQ_08-249_Parsons_leaves.html (accessed 25 July 2011). 123 Brian Berger, \u201cBush Signs NASA Budget, Soyuz Waiver into Law,\u201d Space.com, 5 October 2008, http://www. space.com/5929-bush-signs-nasa-budget-soyuz-waiver-law.html (accessed 16 August 2011).)",

Images focusing on the disc (the halo of dust and gas rotating around the star) revealed that, instead of a smooth flow, one quadrant has a large bulge, indicating the orbital path of a planet that could be many times larger than Jupiter. No actual planet was visible in the images, only the effects of its gravitational pull. Nevertheless, this was the strongest evidence to date in visible light, of the presence of a possible planet. Beta Pictoris is younger (20 million to 100 million years old compared to the Sun\u2019s 4.5 to 5 billion years) and about eight times brighter than the Sun. The formation of planets around a young star suggested that planets form very early in the life of a solar system.(Washington Post, \u201cImages Support Theory of New Planet: Hubble Photos Show Bulge in Star\u2019s Halo Dust\u201463 Light-Years from Sun,\u201d 9 January 1998.)",

A close-up image of Pele showed part of the volcano glowing in the dark, with Pele\u2019s hot lava behaving similarly to active lava lakes in Hawaii. Galileo\u2019s Photopolarimeter Radiometer and Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer had provided detailed temperature maps of Loki, indicating the presence of an enormous caldera repeatedly flooded by lava. New data had clarified the location of lava from Prometheus, erupting, advancing, and producing plumes.

Federal law required GAO to provide verification of these amounts to the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology and to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. However, GAO said that NASA\u2019s lack of an integrated financial management system had prevented NASA from providing GAO with details of costs charged against these programs. GAO reported that NASA\u2019s 10 centers operated separate accounting systems, each with its own policies and practices, and that some centers could not provide complete and detailed documentation of accounts covering several fiscal years. GAO also reported that NASA officials had responded that NASA\u2019s accounts were verifiable, stating that the verification problems lay in GAO\u2019s auditing methodology rather than in NASA\u2019s system of accounting.(U.S. General Accounting Office, \u201cNASA Space Station Cost Limits\u201d (report no.

Mars Global Surveyor had traveled for 10 months and for more than 435 million miles (700 million kilometers) to reach Mars. According to Glenn E. Cunningham of NASA\u2019s JPL, the process of transforming Global Surveyor from a high-speed-travel spacecraft into a slow-moving craft subject to Mars\u2019s gravitational pull was \u201ca nail-biter.\u201d Without the powerful propellant, the transition could not occur, which would have ended any hope of the mission\u2019s gathering data. With the opening of the valves complete, NASA scientists were optimistic that the US$250 million probe would descend slowly into a tight orbit of Mars, yielding new information about the planet.",

A star so turbulent that its eruptions would spread a cloud of gases spanning four light-years, the distance from the Sun to the nearest star. A star so powerful that it glows with the energy of 10 million suns, making it the brightest ever observed in our galaxy, the Milky Way. Actually, a star so big and bright should be unimaginable, according to some theories of star formation. But there it is, near the center of the Milky Way, long hidden from the human eye by vast dust clouds and its magnitude only now revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope, using a camera sensitive to the infrared light that penetrates the clouds.",

The \u201ccelestial mammoth,\u201d large enough to fill the diameter of the Earth\u2019s orbit, reportedly releases up to 10 million times the power of the Sun. The team from the University of California at Los Angeles estimated that the star, possibly as old as 3 million years, weighs up to 200 times the mass of the Sun. The team nicknamed it the Pistol Star because it has a pistol-shaped nebula. Despite the star\u2019s mass and brightness, it was not visible to the naked eye because of the interstellar dust clouds between Earth and the center of the Milky Way. Therefore, astronomers had used infrared technology to observe the star. Team researcher Mark R. Morris argued that the discovery of the massive star near the center of the galaxy would force scientists to rethink their conceptions of how stars formed in the first place.(Associated Press, \u201cSpace Monster,\u201d 8 October 1997; NASA, \u201cHubble Identifies What May Be the Most Luminous Star Known,\u201d news release 97-227, 7 October 1997.)",

The X Prize competition would award US$10 million to the first private organization to create a spacecraft transporting a pilot and payload, with the equivalent weight of two passengers, to an altitude of 100 kilometers (62.1 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface, twice in two weeks. California-based Scaled Composites had built SpaceShipOne, and the company\u2019s founder Burt Rutan had designed the vehicle. The spacecraft left California\u2019s Mojave Airport at 7:11 a.m. (PST), affixed to another aircraft. The aircraft released SpaceShipOne after attaining an altitude of 48,000 feet (9.1 miles or 14.6 kilometers). Although SpaceShipOne had some difficulty during its ascent, the vehicle\u2019s pilot Michael W. Melvill was able to guide the vehicle to a peak altitude of 337,500 feet (63.9 miles or 102.9 kilometers). However, Scaled Composites would have to repeat the feat within the subsequent two weeks to win the Ansari X Prize.(Scaled Composites, \u201cSpaceShipOne Surpasses 100 Km Altitude on First X-Prize Flight,\u201d news release, 29 September 2004; Peter Pae, \u201cCraft Rolls On into Space in Bid for Prize,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 30 September 2004. 690 X PRIZE Foundation, \u201cAnsari X PRIZE,\u201d http://space.xprize.org/ansari-x-prize (accessed 12 May 2009); Scaled Composites, \u201cSpaceShipOne Captures X-Prize,\u201d 4 October 2004, http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/041004_spaceshipone_x-prize_flight_2.html (accessed 12 May 2009); John Schwartz, \u201cPrivate Rocket Ship Earns $10 Million in New Space Race,\u201d New York Times, 5 October 2004.)",

        "story": "In the most serious of a string of problems for the Russian Mir space station, the 7-ton (6,400- kilogram or 6.4-tonne) robotic cargo spacecraft Progress accelerated out of control while docking and crashed into Mir, damaging the Spektr module, tearing a solar-power array, and crumpling an exposed radiator. When the craft crashed into Mir, U.S. astronaut, British-born C. Michael Foale was inside the Spektr module, which he had been using as his sleeping and research quarters. Foale immediately abandoned the damaged module and slammed shut a hatch, sealing off the leaking Spektr. Spektr depressurized completely, and later the entire space station suffered a slight depressurization. When the collision occurred, Mir cosmonaut Vasili V. Tsibliyev was controlling the Progress manually, attempting to re-dock the craft, to test the updated manual-control system. The Progress had already docked with Mir a few days earlier, when the crew had unloaded cargo and filled the craft\u2019s hold with trash. In addition to damaging Mir, the collision temporarily jarred the station off its normal flying orbit. Although the crew quickly remedied this problem, the three-man team had to work inside a darkened, partially powered station. Russian and American space officials estimated that Mir had lost half of its operating power from the collision. The collision heightened tensions between Russian and American space officials, as questions mounted about the safety of the crew aboard the failing space station. U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology Chairperson F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) met with NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, urging NASA not to send American astronauts to Mir until the station\u2019s safety standards had improved significantly. Yuri N. Koptev, Director General of the Russian Space Agency, responded angrily to Sensenbrenner\u2019s suggestion.(Michael R. Gordon, \u201cRussian Space Station Damaged in Collision with a Cargo Vessel,\u201d New York Times, 26 June 1997; Kathy Sawyer, \u201cDocking Crash Cripples Mir Space Station,\u201d Washington Post, 26 June 1997; Associated Press, \u201cRussians Slow To Announce Mir Crash, but More Forthcoming than in Past,\u201d 25; David Hoffman, \u201cU.S. Questions on Mir\u2019s Safety Anger Russia,\u201d Washington Post, 27 June 1997; Paul Hoversten, \u201cFuture of U.S.-Russian Mission Shaky,\u201d USA Today, 26 June 1997.)",

However, Secretary Mineta also announced that the government would permit airports to reopen and flights to resume only on a case-by-case basis, pending airports\u2019 implementation of stricter security measures. Before reopening, airports would have to clear all individuals from terminals and conduct security searches. After reopening, airports would have to increase the number of law enforcement personnel at their facilities. Secretary Mineta had made the decisions after consulting with the White House and with intelligence and law enforcement officials. On the previous day, he had only allowed aircraft to use the nation\u2019s airspace if flight controllers had diverted them from their original destination or had repositioned them so that they could resume flying upon government approval.(Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), \u201cStatement of U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y.

The aircraft took off from the Zhukovsky Airfield south of Moscow. During the Tu-144LL flight, researchers studied the impact of excessive speeds on the aircraft\u2019s internal and exterior surfaces, engine temperature, and handling. The aircraft\u2019s body, constructed primarily from light aluminum alloy, held up well during the initial test. The Tu-144LL project supported NASA\u2019s High-Speed Research Program, which had begun in 1990, to encourage the development of technologies supporting supersonic commercial travel. The Boeing Company had led the U.S. industry involvement in the project, with support from McDonnell Douglas Aircraft, Rockwell International Corporation, Pratt & Whitney, and General Electric Company. The project\u2019s aim was to prepare flight-research facilities to adapt to market demands of the future.

        "story": "The Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation announced that McDonnell Douglas would merge with Boeing in a stock-for-stock transaction. The merger, the biggest in aerospace history, positioned Boeing to compete with Europe\u2019s Airbus Industrie for nearly all commercial airline contracts. The merger also strengthened Boeing\u2019s position as one of the most influential companies, both domestically and internationally, in the United States. The US$13.3 billion deal would place under a single umbrella nearly 200,000 employees, producing annual revenues in excess of US$48 billion. The Boeing Company also emerged from the deal with improved chances of winning major military contracts, whereas, previously, the company had few ventures involving the military aerospace industry. However, McDonnell Douglas had been the main supplier to the military of F/A-18 and F-15 Eagle-model fighter jets to the military. Thus, the merger brought together leaders in the commercial and military sectors of the aerospace industry, creating what one industry analyst called an \u201c800-pound gorilla.\u201d McDonnell Douglas stock rose 20 percent on the first day of trading following the announcement.(The Boeing Company, \u201cMcDonnell Douglas To Merge with Boeing, Combination To Be the World\u2019s Largest Aerospace Company,\u201d news release, 15 December 1996; Peter Kaplan, \u201cMission Inevitable,\u201d Washington Times, 17 December 1996; David E.

Previously, scientists had been able to infer the existence of such planets by observing their gravitational effect on suns, but were unable to see them with telescopes. Located 450 light-years away in the Taurus constellation, a binary star system, the planet appeared to be at least twice the size of Jupiter. Designated TMR-1C, the planet orbited 130 billion miles (210 billion kilometers) from its parent stars.
