        "story": "NASA successfully launched its Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) aboard a Delta 2 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Lockheed Martin\u2013built SIRTF was the fourth and final of NASA\u2019s Great Observatories, following the HST, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. NASA had designed the 110-pound (50-kilogram), 33.5-inch (85-centimeter) telescope to measure heat from celestial objects. SIRTF would study some of the same deep space objects as the other Great Observatories, as well as studying other parts of the cosmos. Michael Jura, SIRTF interdisciplinary scientist for planetary science at the University of California at Los Angeles, remarked that one of SIRTF\u2019s main scientific goals was to develop a better understanding of star and planet formation. The project, originally proposed in the mid- 1970s, had faced repeated budgetary cutbacks and delays. NASA planned for SIRTF\u2019s mission to last a minimum of 30 months, at an anticipated cost of US$1.19 billion.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 598; Associated Press, \u201cNASA Launches Rocket with Infrared Scope,\u201d 25 August 2003. 154)",

A group of scientists led by Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics had examined data collected by NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory. The team had studied x-rays emitted by enigmatic objects located in nearby galaxies, finding that the volume of x-rays emanating from these objects was comparable to or greater than the volume emitted by relatively warmer, larger hard x-ray sources, such as neutron stars and supermassive black holes. The findings indicated that the newly discovered objects could be a type of black hole that the researchers termed \u201cquasi-soft\u201d x-ray sources.(NASA, \u201cEnigmatic X-ray Sources May Point To New Class of Black Holes,\u201d news release 04-067, 1 March 2004; Frank Morring Jr., \u201cIn Orbit,\u201d Aviation Week and Space Technology 160, no. 10 (8 March 2004): 19.)",

However, they were uncertain about whether the galaxy\u2019s gamma rays originate predominantly from so-called point sources, such as black holes and neutron stars, or from diffuse sources, such as gas atoms, which are abundant in the Milky Way. Using data from ESA\u2019s INTEGRALInternational Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratoryresearchers led by François Lebrun found that point sources account for nearly all of the gamma rays in the Milky Way, and diffuse sources play a distinctly minor role in gamma-ray production.(Henry Fountain, \u201cObservatory,\u201d New York Times, 23 March 2004; F.

Budarin, touched down in the steppes of Kazakhstan 276 miles (444 kilometers) off course. The landing was the first time American astronauts had returned to Earth in a foreign spacecraft. Budarin, Bowersox, and Pettit had arrived at the ISS in November 2002 aboard Endeavour, scheduled to return to Earth aboard another Shuttle flight on 11 March. However, the Columbia disaster in February had grounded the remaining three Shuttles in NASA\u2019s fleet, prolonging the crew\u2019s stay aboard the ISS. Russian search teams took 2 hours, using a helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft, to find the crew. The last radio contact between the capsule and Mission Control Center in Moscow had occurred after the craft\u2019s parachutes opened, about 15 minutes before landing. Failure to reestablish contact had caused concern for the trio\u2019s welfare. Russian Space Agency spokesperson Sergei Gorbunov announced that a special commission would investigate the causes of the malfunctions during landing.(Mark Carreau, \u201cAnxiety as Astronauts Miss Target for Landing,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 5 May 2003; Sharon LaFraniere, \u201cSpace Station Crew Returns Home in Russian Soyuz,\u201d Washington Post, 5 May 2003.)",

The 12-foot-long (3.7-meter-long) unpiloted, experimental aircraft flew for approximately 11 seconds over the Pacific Ocean, at an altitude of 95,000 feet (approximately 29,000 meters), before NASA deliberately landed the aircraft in the ocean.

NASA also noted that, if the crew members had to evacuate the space station, Russia and the United States could continue to operate the ISS from Earth. Officials cited a number of reasons for the supply shortage on the ISS, including the postponement of regular supply missions after the Columbia accident and the necessary removal of some food supplies from an August 2004 resupply flight, to make room for equipment to monitor air quality in the ISS.(Mark Carreau, \u201cSpace Station Crew Endures Food Shortage,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 10 December 2004.)",

According to scientists, the discovery provided important information about the creation of many types of celestial bodies. Scientists were surprised to find that the black holes in the cores of globular star clusters\u2015bright clusters of stars that orbit galaxies, including the Milky Way\u2015are nearly 10,000 times less massive than galaxies. The HST data revealed that black holes in globular star clusters are proportionally smaller than massive black holes found in galaxies, demonstrating that the mass of a black hole is proportional to its stellar surroundings. The results also indicated that when the globular star clusters had formed they had black holes, suggesting that, to form large star clusters, black holes must act as gravitational anchors. Scientists believed these findings might illuminate the process by which galaxies and globular clusters formed. The discovery also suggested that black holes are more ubiquitous than scientists had previously thought.(NASA, \u201cHubble Discovers Black Holes in Unexpected Places,\u201d news release 02-174, 17 September 2002; William Harwood, \u201cFinding May Connect Dots on How Galaxies Form; Mid-size Black Holes Are Discovered,\u201d Washington Post, 18 September 2002.)",

The scientists had used 30 separate images from Chandra to construct a montage of the Milky Way\u2019s central regions, revealing hundreds of white dwarf stars, neutron stars, and black holes, shrouded by the extremely hot gas around a massive black hole. The researchers found that emissions from highly ionized iron, previously attributed to diffuse hot gas, had actually originated from discrete sources in the Milky Way\u2019s white dwarf stars, neutron stars, and black holes. The findings helped clarify the relative contributions of diffuse and discrete sources of x-rays emitted from the galaxy.(NASA, \u201cChandra Takes In Bright Lights, Big City of Milky Way,\u201d news release 02-03, 9 January 2002; Q.

The X-43A contained an experimental engine\u2015called a supersonic combustion ramjet or scramjet. The scramjet engine had no moving parts and did not use fuel from an on-board tank, as is the case with rockets. Instead, the engine used oxygen from the atmosphere, passing through the vehicle, to ignite fuel. NASA had explored the use of scramjets as an alternative to rocket power for space-access vehicles, with the hope that scramjet vehicles would operate more like an airplane than a rocket. The mission lifted off from NASA\u2019s DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 2:30 p.m. (PST). A NASA B-52 carried the unpiloted X-43A to an altitude of 40,000 feet (7.6 miles or 12.2 kilometers). Before the X-43A had attained at an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers), a Pegasus rocket booster launched from the B-52, providing an initial acceleration that enabled the X-43A to attain an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers). The experimental aircraft flew for nearly 10 seconds at that altitude before descending into the Pacific Ocean as planned, nearly 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) off the coast of California.(John Johnson, \u201cX-43A Aircraft Sets Speed Record at 6,500 MPH,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 17 November 2004; NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s X-43A Scramjet Breaks Speed Record,\u201d news release 04-373, 16 November 2004.)",

        "story": "Scientists announced an estimate of the universe\u2019s age based on new HST images of very faint white dwarf stars in Messier 4 (M4), a cluster of stars in the constellation Scorpius. The researchers had closely examined M4\u2019s white dwarf starslow-mass stars that have exhausted their fuel sources for thermonuclear fusion. Although white dwarfs cool at a predictable rate, enabling scientists to estimate their age, they become progressively fainter as they cool, making them difficult to observe. The HST had provided the first deep exposures of these dim stars, which the astronomers discovered were M4\u2019s oldest white dwarf stars, at around 12 to 13 billion years old. Earlier Hubble observations had revealed that the first stars in the universe had formed less than 1 billion years after the universe\u2019s emergence from the Big Bang. Thus, the researchers had discovered that the age of these M4 white dwarfs supported the previous estimates that the universe\u2019s age is 13 to 14 billion years old. The use of this new methodology to estimate the universe\u2019s age represented a major departure from those used previously.(NASA, \u201cHubble Uncovers Oldest \u2018Clocks\u2019 in Space To Read Age of Universe,\u201d news release 02-73, 24 April 2004; Brad M.

NASA and an international team of participants had designed the spacecraft to detect and analyze gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\u2015ephemeral explosions that occur throughout the universe, usually far from Earth. GRBs may indicate a number of significant cosmological events, such as the collision of extremely dense celestial bodies or the formation of black holes. Swift was equipped with three telescopes to study GRBs, including the Burst Alert Telescope, which could detect and locate GRBs, and the X-ray Telescope (XRT) and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT), two telescopes that could study the bursts\u2019 afterglows.
