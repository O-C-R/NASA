        "story": "At the American Physical Society Spring Meeting, a team of cosmologists announced that they had discovered the \u201cmusic of creation,\u201d using an extremely sensitive microwave telescope. The researchers presented their discovery of the sound waves that had rippled through the universe some 14 billion years ago. The team of the Balloon Observation of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics (BOOMERANG) project had gathered the data from a telescope aboard a balloon, which circumnavigated Antarctica at an altitude of 23 miles (37 kilometers). According to Team Leader Paolo deBernardis, the beginning of the universe left behind a residue of light and sound, providing scientists with hints about the details of the Big Bang: \u201cThe early universe is full of sound waves compressing and rarefying matter and light, much like sound waves compress and rarefy air inside a flute or trumpet.\u201d The BOOMERANG team\u2019s findings provided a new means of examining the early universe and new evidence to use in calculating how it changed. Scientists praised the discoveries as \u201cstunning and humbling\u201d evidence that cosmologists were using the correct model to describe the early universe.(NASA, \u201cNew Boomerang Findings Reveal \u2018Music\u2019 of the Early Universe,\u201d news release 01-87, 29 April 2001; Kathy Sawyer, \u201cAstronomy Peers into Face of Infant Universe,\u201d Washington Post, 30 April 2001.)",

        "story": "After months of debate over whether Russia should bring Mir out of orbit and what damage the space station might cause when it fell to Earth, the 15-year-old Mir space station plunged into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, spraying some of its remnants into the Pacific Ocean. The splashdown marked the end of a 2.2 billion-mile journey for Mir. Witnesses in Fiji reported seeing streaks of gold and silver lights across the sky when Mir fell, but nobody reported any damage from pieces of the falling space station. U.S. officials at the Pentagon tracked the descent, while Japan\u2019s public safety chief urged people to stay indoors to avoid falling debris. Anatoly Y. Solovyev, a Russian cosmonaut who had spent 651 days aboard Mir, remarked that he was sad to see the end of the pathbreaking space station: \u201cAn entire era of our Soviet space program is ending, into which we invested not only our money, but what is more important, our intellectual potential.\u201d Once Mir had descended safely, officials of the Russian Space Agency praised the precise sequence of maneuvers that had brought the space station safely from orbit.(Patrick E.
