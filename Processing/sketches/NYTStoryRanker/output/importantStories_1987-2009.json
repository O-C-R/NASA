            "lead_paragraph": "As early as 1997, a senior NASA engineer warned that hardened foam popping off the external fuel tank on the Columbia shuttle had caused significant damage to the ceramic tiles protecting the vehicle from re-entry temperatures. The warning was sure to receive new scrutiny after NASA said yesterday that its investigation into the cause of the destruction of the space shuttle on Saturday was focusing on damage to tiles that may have been caused by foam or ice or a combination of the two. NASA officials also acknowledged that they might have underestimated the potential seriousness of damage sustained by the tiles when the shuttle lifted off. Gregory N. Katnik, a NASA engineer at Cape Canaveral, said in a report dated Dec. 23, 1997, that the Columbia had sustained damage to more than 300 tiles on a recent flight. The inspection after a Columbia mission in 1997 showed that the tiles had sustained damage that was ''not normal,'' Mr. Katnik said. In a number of other shuttle flights, tile damage from falling foam also caused smaller amounts of damage, but NASA decided that over all, the problem did not threaten the survival of its spacecraft. Now the agency is re-examining that assumption as it struggles to explain the mystery of how the Columbia broke up as it soared back into the atmosphere. Ron D. Dittemore, the shuttle program manager, told a news conference yesterday that damage to the tiles was the leading focus of the investigation, but he cautioned that what appeared to be the most likely solution might prove illusory as the complex inquiry moved ahead. ''There's some other event; there's some other missing link that we don't have yet that is contributing to this temperature increase,'' Mr. Dittemore said. ''It's a mystery to us.'' But new evidence that surfaced yesterday suggested that damage to the tiles may have been more severe and covered a wider area than first estimated. A videotape made by a team of NASA scientists at the Jan. 16 liftoff appeared to show a bushel-basket-sized chunk of debris breaking away from the external fuel tank and striking the fragile protective tiles on the underside of the left wing. A NASA analysis suggested the impact could have damaged a swath of tile as large as 7 inches wide and 32 inches long, according to an agency memorandum made public yesterday. The possibility that damaged tile could have caused the ship to break apart when it re-entered the atmosphere was supported by several outside experts in aerodynamics. They said in interviews that even slightly damaged tiles -- perhaps only roughened or cracked -- could generate turbulence near the tiles during the tremendous speeds of re-entry, creating potentially dangerous heating of Columbia's aluminum skin. ''There is a possibility that just damage to the tile to the point that they are rougher could create increased heating,'' said Dr. Michael Holden, director of the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center in New York, which does aerodynamic testing of the shuttles. ''If it went turbulent, you'd be in more jeopardy,'' possibly affecting the survival of the entire craft, Dr. Holden said. While NASA has had trouble working out the details of how the foam impact could have led to the breakup, the accumulating evidence could force the agency to alter its initial determination that the damage seen on the Columbia was not significant, said Dr. Edward Crawley, chairman of the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's possible that more insulation fell off than they thought,'' Dr. Crawley said. ''It's possible that it hit in a way that caused more damage than their model suggested.'' But it is also possible, Dr. Crawley said, that ''there's still sort of a missing event here'' -- the link that will make a new pattern, and a new theory for the catastrophe, emerge. The newly released NASA video shows a whitish object soaring backward, striking the Columbia's left wing and bursting into a cloud of dust. The oblong chunk appears to be the size of the shuttle's astronaut hatch, which measures about 40 inches by 40 inches. Mr. Dittemore said NASA's analysis determined that the piece probably weighed just under three pounds, though he said that new and more intensive work was being done that could revise that number. With a range of assumptions about the exact angle at which the piece ricocheted off the spacecraft, he said, NASA determined that anywhere from a single tile to a swath 32 inches long could have been damaged. He said that NASA's computer model generally predicted more damage than would actually take place. The debris was first noticed the day after the shuttle liftoff when engineers were reviewing film. But Mr. Dittemore said no one on NASA's study team initially thought the damage posed a serious concern. ''At the time I was not aware of anybody that had those feelings, at least to the point where they would want to come forward and identify that there's still something that they think remains undone,'' Mr. Dittemore said. Reports prepared during the flight of the Columbia were released yesterday by NASA. They showed that the falling debris occurred 81 seconds into the flight and was first identified the day after the liftoff. ''At approximately 81 seconds Mission Elapsed Time, a large light-colored piece of debris was seen to originate from an area near the ET/Orbiter forward attach bipod,'' the report said. ''The debris appeared to move outboard and then fall aft along the left side of the Orbiter fuselage, striking the leading edge of the left wing.'' The report said that more detail would come from analysis of high-speed tracking films. A report two days later said analysis of the films could not identify individual tiles, but it concluded, ''no indications of larger scale damage were noted.'' On Jan. 28, a report said that a study of films and analysis of temperatures onboard the spacecraft indicated a potential for significant damage to the tiles. But it concluded that there was ''no safety of flight issue.'' But the idea that somehow the tile was extremely vulnerable to damage received support from the earlier report on similar damage. In 1997, Mr. Katnik, the senior NASA engineer, worked in a division that analyzed data from inspections of the shuttles. He is now a technical manager in the Space Shuttle Program Launch Integration Office at the Kennedy Space Center. He said on the 1997 mission the shuttle sustained a significant amount of damage to its heat tiles. In a normal mission, a shuttle will sustain damage to up to 40 tiles because of ice dropping from the external tank and hitting the tiles, Mr. Katnik reported. But on that mission, he said, ''the pattern of hits did not follow aerodynamic expectations, and the number, size and severity of the hits were abnormal.'' Inspectors counted 308 hits. Of those, 132 were ''greater than one inch,'' Mr. Katnik said. Some of the hits measured up to 15 inches long with depths of up to one-and-a-half inches. The tiles were only two inches deep, so the largest hits penetrated three-quarters of the way into the tiles, he noted. The damaged tiles were mostly around the shuttle's nose. After the mission, more than 100 tiles were taken off because ''they were irreparable,'' Mr. Katnik said. The report went on to speculate as to why the foam dropped off. As it turned out, to be environmentally friendly, NASA had eliminated the use of Freon in foam production, Mr. Katnik reported. The Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., later concluded that the absence of Freon led to the detachment of the foam. While the formulation was later improved, the episode revealed potentially dangerous new ways in which tiles could be damaged. ''The tiles still had plenty of material left,'' Mr. Katnik said in an interview yesterday. ''There was a margin of safety.'' Nonetheless, he said, the shuttle ''was coming back with an irritating amount of damage that we had to repair.''",

        "story": "NASA launched a nationwide campaign to recruit elementary, middle, and high school classroom teachers for its astronaut corps, building on the legacy of its Teacher in Space Project of 1985. NASA had selected Christa McAuliffe and Barbara R. Morgan from among 12,000 applicants for the first project, which had ended tragically when Space Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after launching on 28 January 1986 with McAuliffe on board. McAuliffe\u2019s backup Barbara R. Morgan had rejoined NASA in 1998 to train and qualify as a mission specialist. In December 2002, NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe had announced Morgan\u2019s assignment to a November assembly mission to the ISS. NASA planned for the new recruitment campaign to extend the legacy of McAuliffe and the work of Morgan, making future educator- astronauts as much a part of the astronaut corps as test pilots, engineers, physicians, astronomers, geologists, and scientists from other disciplines. To accomplish this goal, NASA planned to train teachers with proven technical skills, making them eligible for missions ranging from 12-day Shuttle flights to months-long residencies aboard the ISS. Because of their ability to communicate with students in the classroom more effectively than traditional NASA astronauts, the educator-astronauts would be a critical part of an educational initiative to \u201cmake math and science as inspiring to youngsters as pop music and sports.\u201d(Mark Carreau, \u201cNASA Seeking a Few Good Teachers,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 22 January 2003.)",

            "lead_paragraph": "As early as 1997, a senior NASA engineer warned that hardened foam popping off the external fuel tank on the Columbia shuttle had caused significant damage to the ceramic tiles protecting the vehicle from re-entry temperatures. The warning was sure to receive new scrutiny after NASA said yesterday that its investigation into the cause of the destruction of the space shuttle on Saturday was focusing on damage to tiles that may have been caused by foam or ice or a combination of the two. NASA officials also acknowledged that they might have underestimated the potential seriousness of damage sustained by the tiles when the shuttle lifted off. Gregory N. Katnik, a NASA engineer at Cape Canaveral, said in a report dated Dec. 23, 1997, that the Columbia had sustained damage to more than 300 tiles on a recent flight. The inspection after a Columbia mission in 1997 showed that the tiles had sustained damage that was ''not normal,'' Mr. Katnik said. In a number of other shuttle flights, tile damage from falling foam also caused smaller amounts of damage, but NASA decided that over all, the problem did not threaten the survival of its spacecraft. Now the agency is re-examining that assumption as it struggles to explain the mystery of how the Columbia broke up as it soared back into the atmosphere. Ron D. Dittemore, the shuttle program manager, told a news conference yesterday that damage to the tiles was the leading focus of the investigation, but he cautioned that what appeared to be the most likely solution might prove illusory as the complex inquiry moved ahead. ''There's some other event; there's some other missing link that we don't have yet that is contributing to this temperature increase,'' Mr. Dittemore said. ''It's a mystery to us.'' But new evidence that surfaced yesterday suggested that damage to the tiles may have been more severe and covered a wider area than first estimated. A videotape made by a team of NASA scientists at the Jan. 16 liftoff appeared to show a bushel-basket-sized chunk of debris breaking away from the external fuel tank and striking the fragile protective tiles on the underside of the left wing. A NASA analysis suggested the impact could have damaged a swath of tile as large as 7 inches wide and 32 inches long, according to an agency memorandum made public yesterday. The possibility that damaged tile could have caused the ship to break apart when it re-entered the atmosphere was supported by several outside experts in aerodynamics. They said in interviews that even slightly damaged tiles -- perhaps only roughened or cracked -- could generate turbulence near the tiles during the tremendous speeds of re-entry, creating potentially dangerous heating of Columbia's aluminum skin. ''There is a possibility that just damage to the tile to the point that they are rougher could create increased heating,'' said Dr. Michael Holden, director of the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center in New York, which does aerodynamic testing of the shuttles. ''If it went turbulent, you'd be in more jeopardy,'' possibly affecting the survival of the entire craft, Dr. Holden said. While NASA has had trouble working out the details of how the foam impact could have led to the breakup, the accumulating evidence could force the agency to alter its initial determination that the damage seen on the Columbia was not significant, said Dr. Edward Crawley, chairman of the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's possible that more insulation fell off than they thought,'' Dr. Crawley said. ''It's possible that it hit in a way that caused more damage than their model suggested.'' But it is also possible, Dr. Crawley said, that ''there's still sort of a missing event here'' -- the link that will make a new pattern, and a new theory for the catastrophe, emerge. The newly released NASA video shows a whitish object soaring backward, striking the Columbia's left wing and bursting into a cloud of dust. The oblong chunk appears to be the size of the shuttle's astronaut hatch, which measures about 40 inches by 40 inches. Mr. Dittemore said NASA's analysis determined that the piece probably weighed just under three pounds, though he said that new and more intensive work was being done that could revise that number. With a range of assumptions about the exact angle at which the piece ricocheted off the spacecraft, he said, NASA determined that anywhere from a single tile to a swath 32 inches long could have been damaged. He said that NASA's computer model generally predicted more damage than would actually take place. The debris was first noticed the day after the shuttle liftoff when engineers were reviewing film. But Mr. Dittemore said no one on NASA's study team initially thought the damage posed a serious concern. ''At the time I was not aware of anybody that had those feelings, at least to the point where they would want to come forward and identify that there's still something that they think remains undone,'' Mr. Dittemore said. Reports prepared during the flight of the Columbia were released yesterday by NASA. They showed that the falling debris occurred 81 seconds into the flight and was first identified the day after the liftoff. ''At approximately 81 seconds Mission Elapsed Time, a large light-colored piece of debris was seen to originate from an area near the ET/Orbiter forward attach bipod,'' the report said. ''The debris appeared to move outboard and then fall aft along the left side of the Orbiter fuselage, striking the leading edge of the left wing.'' The report said that more detail would come from analysis of high-speed tracking films. A report two days later said analysis of the films could not identify individual tiles, but it concluded, ''no indications of larger scale damage were noted.'' On Jan. 28, a report said that a study of films and analysis of temperatures onboard the spacecraft indicated a potential for significant damage to the tiles. But it concluded that there was ''no safety of flight issue.'' But the idea that somehow the tile was extremely vulnerable to damage received support from the earlier report on similar damage. In 1997, Mr. Katnik, the senior NASA engineer, worked in a division that analyzed data from inspections of the shuttles. He is now a technical manager in the Space Shuttle Program Launch Integration Office at the Kennedy Space Center. He said on the 1997 mission the shuttle sustained a significant amount of damage to its heat tiles. In a normal mission, a shuttle will sustain damage to up to 40 tiles because of ice dropping from the external tank and hitting the tiles, Mr. Katnik reported. But on that mission, he said, ''the pattern of hits did not follow aerodynamic expectations, and the number, size and severity of the hits were abnormal.'' Inspectors counted 308 hits. Of those, 132 were ''greater than one inch,'' Mr. Katnik said. Some of the hits measured up to 15 inches long with depths of up to one-and-a-half inches. The tiles were only two inches deep, so the largest hits penetrated three-quarters of the way into the tiles, he noted. The damaged tiles were mostly around the shuttle's nose. After the mission, more than 100 tiles were taken off because ''they were irreparable,'' Mr. Katnik said. The report went on to speculate as to why the foam dropped off. As it turned out, to be environmentally friendly, NASA had eliminated the use of Freon in foam production, Mr. Katnik reported. The Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., later concluded that the absence of Freon led to the detachment of the foam. While the formulation was later improved, the episode revealed potentially dangerous new ways in which tiles could be damaged. ''The tiles still had plenty of material left,'' Mr. Katnik said in an interview yesterday. ''There was a margin of safety.'' Nonetheless, he said, the shuttle ''was coming back with an irritating amount of damage that we had to repair.''",

The crewRussian cosmonaut Nikolai M. Budarin and American astronauts Kenneth D. Bowersox and Donald R. Pettithad served at the outpost for 73 days, and NASA had scheduled their return to Earth on Shuttle Atlantis for 1 March. However, in the wake of the Columbia disaster, NASA had grounded all Shuttles indefinitely. Although the suspension of Shuttle flights did not place the ISS crew in danger, it did affect the schedule of space station construction and interrupted NASA\u2019s plan to install a high-speed gyroscope at the station in March, to replace one that had broken down in June 2002. With only three operational gyroscopes, the ISS would continue to drift, but NASA did not consider the matter a time-critical problem.(Todd Ackerman, \u201cCargo Craft Resupplies Outpost Crew Hanging in Orbit,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 5 February 2003; NASA, \u201cSpaceflight 2003: International Space Station Goals and Objectives,\u201d http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/reports/2003/iss.html (accessed 13 November 2009).)",

The changes were going to be introduced this year. Officials are now trying to determine whether it was the problem that they sought to repair that led debris to detach from the 15-story external tank some 80 seconds into the liftoff. The debris struck the left wing, possibly breaching the shuttle skin to let superheated gases enter on re-entry, setting off the fatal chain of events upon re-entry on Feb. 1, some experts said.",

NASA had scheduled the landing for 9:16 a.m. (EST). NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe issued a statement describing all the steps NASA had taken after the loss of the Shuttle. NASA officials had spoken with President George W.

The board comprised an external group of people independent from NASA, charged with examining all the information that Mission Control had locked down when it lost communication with Columbia.(NASA, \u201cNASA Statement on Loss of Communications with Columbia,\u201d news release 03-030, 1 February 2003, ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/2003/03-030.txt (accessed 15 July 2008); NASA, \u201cStatement by NASA Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe,\u201d news release 03-032, 1 February 2003, ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/2003/03-032.txt (accessed 15 July 2008); Washington Post, \u201cThe Columbia Catastrophe,\u201d 2 February 2003.)",

The scientists speculated that the observable counterpart signified the existence of an unobservable, catastrophic burst of gamma rays, unleashing as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun does in 10 billion years. The New Technology Telescope and the W. M. Keck Telescope, added to the HST in 1997, had enabled scientists to make the observation. According to Gerald J. Fishman of Marshall Space Flight Center, the lead investigator of NASA\u2019s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, astronomers could not overestimate the significance of the find, even if the visible- light phenomenon was only an indicator of another unobservable phenomenon. \u201cThis [discovery] opens up a whole new era in GRB research,\u201d Fishman explained. \u201cWe now know that it is possible to see the fading optical emission by rapid follow-up observations with powerful telescopes. With several more of these, we should be able to narrow the models of what could be causing these gigantic outbursts.\u201d(NASA, \u201cHubble Tracks the Fading Optical Counterpart of a Gamma-Ray Burst,\u201d news release 97-63, 1 April 1997.)",

These aviation reporters are among the few remaining members of what was once a much larger corps of journalists specializing in coverage of air and space travel.",

Larry Sanderson, President of the Soaring Society of America, remarked that \u201cboth victims were top pilots in \u2018an extremely well-built aircraft. So it had to be a very unusual set of circumstances that stressed the craft\u2019.\u201d Both Engen and Ivans were officers of the Soaring Society, and Ivans, a pioneer in the field, had won many awards for high-altitude soaring. Engen had retired from the U.S. Navy in 1978, with the rank of vice admiral and had been a test pilot for many years. After retiring from the Navy, he had served for two years on the National Transportation Safety Board and as administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration between 1984 and 1987. He became Director of the National Air and Space Museum in 1996, following the resignation of Martin O. Harwit.",

The Council of Scientific Society Presidents called the report \u201ca wake-up call for [f]ederal investment policies.\u201d The study joined an ongoing debate over exactly what contribution general scientific research made to the national economy.

The CAIB conducted the test in preparation for an official test with panels composed of reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC), a material two and one-half times more resilient than fiberglass. In addition to determining whether foam could damage the fiberglass, the CAIB intended the test to calibrate the mechanism for testing the RCC without using up scarce RCC samples.(John Schwartz and Matthew L.

Halsell Jr. called Mission STS-94 a \u201conce-in-a-career opportunity\u201d for the seven-person crew, the same crew that had embarked upon Mission STS-83 in April 1997. NASA had cut short Mission STS-83 because of a fuel cell problem. The reflight gave NASA officials and the Shuttle crew a chance to undertake the experiments planned for the original mission, including testing hardware and procedures planned for the International Space Station. NASA was able to launch Columbia just 84 days after bringing the Shuttle home, at a cost of about 20 percent of the amount needed to set off a new Shuttle mission. The crew planned to carry out the original 33 experiments over the course of the 16-day science mission. Mission STS-94, NASA clarified, involved the same vehicle, crew, Microgravity Science Laboratory payload, and experiment schedule as the recalled mission. The mission was the first in the 36-year history of unpiloted spaceflight in which the same crew flew together in space more than once.(NASA, \u201cColumbia and Crew Ready for Reflight of Microgravity Sciences Laboratory-1 Payload on Mission STS-94,\u201d news release J97-21, June 1997; William Harwood, \u201cShuttle Begins Second Attempt at Mission,\u201d Washington Post, 2 July 1997; Warren Leary, \u201cShuttle Roars Aloft To Complete Mission Interrupted in April,\u201d New York Times, 2 July 1997; Associated Press, \u201cSpace Shuttle Blasts Off on Repeat Science Mission,\u201d 1 July 1997.)",

        "story": "NASA announced that images provided by the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS), which NASA had launched in December 1998, showed new evidence that extra- planetary systems contain water. In particular, astronomers had studied the giant IRC+10216 star, also known as CW Leonis, and had located water vapor surrounding the celestial body. Scientists had never considered the giant star, located some 500 light-years from Earth, as a likely host of water because of its high levels of carbon. Gary Melnick of the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics led the SWAS study, which concluded that the most viable explanation for the \u201csubstantial concentrations of water vapor\u201d around the star was that the star\u2019s gravity had pulled the water vapor from the icy surfaces of nearby comets. The discovery had broad implications for scientists\u2019 theories about how Earth might eventually end. \u201cWe think we are witnessing the type of apocalypse that will ultimately befall our own planetary system,\u201d said one SWAS researcher. \u201cSeveral billion years from now, the Sun will become a giant star and its power output will increase five thousand fold. As the luminosity of the Sun increases, a wave of water vaporization will spread outwards through the solar system, starting with Earth\u2019s oceans and extending well beyond the orbit of Neptune.\u201d(Gary J.

The Subcommittee focused on the effect that the FY 2009 budget request would have on the ability of NASA\u2019s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) to implement the George W. Bush administration\u2019s 2004 Vision for Space Exploration (VSE). Among other things, the VSE had mandated that NASA return to the Moon by 2020. The ESMD\u2019s Constellation Program was developing vehicles, such as the Orion CEV and the Ares-I crew launch vehicle (CLV), to implement the VSE. NASA had proposed that the FY 2009 budget request include US$3.5 billion in funding for the ESMD. During the hearing, Subcommittee Chair Mark E. Udall (D-CO) expressed concern that space exploration projects were underfunded and might become a drain on NASA\u2019s resources. Furthermore, Cristina T. Chaplain of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified that, because of the complexity of the Constellation Program, GAO was concerned about the reliability of cost estimates for the programs. However, Richard J. Gilbrech, Associate Administrator of the ESMD, asked Congress to support the FY 2009 budget request, asserting that it would provide NASA with a stable source of funding.(U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, \u201cSubcommittee Examines Status of NASA\u2019s Human Exploration Initiative,\u201d press release, 3 April 2008, http://gop.science.house.gov/PressRoom/Item.aspx?ID=94 (accessed 19 January 2011); U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, \u201cSubcommittee Examines Progress and Plans of NASA\u2019s Exploration Initiative,\u201d press release, 3 April 2008, http://sciencedems.house.gov/press/ PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=2142 (accessed 15 March 2011); U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, \u201cNASA\u2019 s Exploration Initiative: Status and Issues,\u201d 110th Cong., 2nd sess., 3 April 2008, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/ pkg/CHRG-110hhrg41471/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg41471.pdf (accessed 4 March 2011).)",

The GAO report stated that before NASA determined the upgrade requirements and priorities for the Shuttles, it should first determine the Shuttles\u2019 operational life and the requirements for meeting the objectives of the Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP). Before the announcement of the new Vision for Space Exploration, the ISTP had encompassed the space policy of the United States. However, GAO noted that the establishment of President Bush\u2019s new Vision for Space Exploration, which formally changed the duration of operations for both the Space Shuttles and the ISS, had largely invalidated the recommendations offered in GAO\u2019s assessment.(U.S. General Accounting Office, \u201cSpace Shuttle: Further Improvements Needed in NASA\u2019s Modernization Efforts\u201d (report no. GAO-04-203, Washington DC, 15 January 2004), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04203.pdf (accessed 30 January 2009).)",

These problems, the investigators say, suggest that NASA may be playing down early warning signs about a range of hazards. Members of the independent board investigating the Columbia breakup on Feb. 1 have warned against concluding that NASA's safety culture has eroded based solely on the circumstances of that accident. Anyone can see danger signs after an accident, Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., the board's head, said at a recent briefing, adding, ''tell me what the next one is if you're so smart.''",

        "story": "The CAIB held its final public hearing, moving its focus beyond the cause of the disaster to a probe of the overall state of NASA\u2019s management. Witnesses identified several key weaknesses in NASA\u2019s management of its personnel, which could have affected safety issues in the Space Shuttle Program. Allen Li of GAO, which had issued a report in 2001 about NASA workforce issues, noted that NASA had faced substantial challenges in attracting and retaining a highly skilled workforce. Therefore, key areas of NASA\u2019s programs had an insufficient number of qualified workers, and the remainder of the staff showed signs of overwork and fatigue. In response to the 2001 report, NASA had developed new systems for monitoring such issues, and Li said that NASA had made noteworthy progress. However, NASA was still requesting congressional approval of personnel reforms that would help ameliorate the situation, reforms that would give NASA the authority to streamline the hiring process and the ability to offer larger recruitment and retention bonuses. Marcia S. Smith of the Congressional Research Service provided the CAIB with a history of NASA\u2019s budget situation but remarked that the CAIB would have difficulty tying budgetary changes directly to safety issues and Shuttle operations. Russell D. Turner, the former CEO of the prime contractor for Shuttle operations, United Space Alliance, defended the work of the firms involved in the Space Shuttle Program.(Tom Shoop, \u201cNASA Needs Management Overhaul, Shuttle Investigators Told,\u201d Government Executive, 13 June 2003.)",

The mission\u2019s crew comprised Commander Terrence W. Wilcutt, Pilot Scott D. Altman, and Mission Specialists Daniel C. Burbank, Edward T. Lu, Yuri I. Malenchenko, Richard A. Mastracchio, and Boris V. Morukov. The purpose of STS-106, also known as ISS Flight 2A.2b, was to connect power, data, and communications cables to the Zvezda service module, as well as to deliver supplies and to perform maintenance. Although NASA officials had expressed concern that STS-106 might encounter a weather delay, the approaching storm had stalled offshore, so the Shuttle program experienced its first punctual launch since John H. Glenn Jr.\u2019s historic flight in October 1998.(Marcia Dunn for Associated Press, \u201cAtlantis Thunders into Orbit on Space Station Mission,\u201d 8 September 2000; NASA, \u201cMission Archives STS-106, International Space Station Flight 2A.2b,\u201d http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-106.html (accessed 30 October 2008).)",

        "story": "Lockheed Martin announced a \u201csweeping reorganization\u201d of key leadership positions, in response to recommendations of the review panel chaired by A. Thomas Young. The Young Panel had urged the company to make structural changes to correct quality-control problems at Astronautics, the unit responsible for Atlas, Titan, and Athena rocket development. In response to the panel\u2019s recommendation to divide the two tasks of product assurance and mission success, Astronautics President G. Thomas Marsh appointed John P. Mari as Vice President of Product Assurance and Roman Matherne as Vice President for Mission Success. Marsh named John Parker, President of the former Mission Success and Product Assurance Section, to head the operations post in Lockheed Martin\u2019s VentureStarTM Program, which the company hoped to develop into a future reusable launch vehicle with the potential to replace the Space Shuttle. Marsh appointed Joel S. Porter as Vice President for Business Development and Advanced Programs for Astronautics, succeeding Matthew B. Foster, who resigned. Other changes at Astronautics included the appointment of Claude McAnally as Vice President of Operations; the appointment of Grover W. Hall Jr. as Vice President of Technical Operations; and the separation of Technical Operations from Manufacturing Operations to better delineate responsibility and accountability, according to the recommendations of the Young Panel. Lockheed tasked Gareth D. Flora, under Marsh\u2019s supervision, with developing, managing, and improving subcontract management. In addition, Flora became responsible for ensuring that the company properly implemented the recommendations of the investigating team, as well as those of a separate U.S. Air Force review of the aerospace industry.(Jeffrey Leib, \u201cLockheed Replaces Key Staff in Astronautics Unit,\u201d Denver Post (CO), 21 September 1999.)",

        "story": "NASA scientists lost contact with the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft as it entered its Martian orbit and disappeared behind the planet, a little less than a year after the launch of its Mars mission in December 1998. Mars Surveyor Project Manager John B. McNamee said that the orbit-insertion burn, a 16-minute-long burn to slow the spacecraft down as it enters orbit, had begun on time. The team of NASA scientists observed 5 minutes of the burn before the craft went behind Mars. At that point, the craft stopped communicating. Communication did not resume at the time the team expected the craft to reappear from the far side of the planet. McNamee reported that the latest navigation results showed that the craft had entered its orbit lower than his team had planned, indicating that NASA\u2019s navigation predictions at the tracking station may have been incorrect. Carl B. Pilcher, Science Director for Solar System Exploration at NASA Headquarters, commented that, although losing the spacecraft was very serious, the loss was \u201cnot devastating to the Mars Surveyor Program as a whole,\u201d because the mission of Mars Polar Lander, scheduled to arrive at Mars two months after Mars Climate Orbiter, was independent of that of Orbiter.(NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \u201cNASA\u2019s Mars Climate Orbiter Believed To Be Lost,\u201d news release, 23 September 1999, http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/99/mcolost.html (accessed 3 March 2008); Reuters, \u201cNASA Loses Contact with Mars Orbiter,\u201d 23 September 1999.)",

It was that meteor, they went on, that caused the largest mass extinction in the Earth's history. Researchers led by Dr. Luann Becker, a geologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said seismic and gravitational measurements showed that the depression, called Bedout (be-DOO), had the general shape of a crater. More significant, they said, jumbled and melted minerals in the rocks could have formed only in the violent upheaval of a meteor's hitting the Earth, not from cooling lava.",

        "story": "Researchers announced that they had found the remains of a large object that crashed into Earth 250 million years ago, possibly causing the largest mass extinction in history. Previously, many scientists had agreed that a large-scale eventthe Permian-Triassic extinctionhad occurred approximately 250 million years ago. However, they had debated about whether volcanic activity or the impact of an extraterrestrial object such as a meteor had caused the event. A team of scientists led by Luann Becker of University of California at Santa Barbara reported the discovery of strong evidence for the impact theorypart of a meteorite or comet, nearly 6 miles (10 kilometers) in diameter, buried in sediment off the coast of Australia. Based on analysis of the object\u2019s age and mineral composition, the team believed that the object might have caused the Permian-Triassic extinctionthe extinction of 90 percent of marine species and 70 percent of land species. NASA and the National Science Foundation had funded the scientists, who cautioned that their findings did not prove definitively that extraterrestrial impact had caused the extinction event.(Guy Gugliotta, \u201cImpact Crater Labeled Clue to Mass Extinction,\u201d Washington Post, 14 May 2004; Richard A.

The CAIB found that a 1.7-pound (0.77-kilogram) piece of foam insulation, traveling at more than 500 miles (804.6 kilometers) per hour, had damaged Columbia\u2019s wing during launch, ultimately leading to its disintegration during reentry. The report stated that management decisions during Columbia\u2019s flight reflected missed opportunities, ineffective communication channels, flawed analysis, and ineffective leadership. When cameras tracking Columbia provided two grainy images showing the foam striking the wing, engineers had immediately begun to discuss obtaining further images of the Shuttle or initiating a spacewalk to check for damages. However, mission managers had \u201cadjourned for a holiday weekend and did not discuss the foam strike.\u201d Upon returning to work on 21 January, the managers had assessed the strike as a postlanding maintenance problem, because smaller foam strikes had left harmless dents in Shuttles during all previous missions. The CAIB\u2019s Executive Director John L. Barry remarked that, among NASA\u2019s competing goals of maintaining costs and meeting schedules, safety had lost out. The Board directly criticized Administrator Sean O\u2019Keefe for increasing pressure to meet a February 2004 launch deadline, thereby creating a pattern similar to that which had led to the Challenger disaster in 1986. The CAIB recommended that NASA implement 15 actions before the next Shuttle flight, including creating an independent safety-and-engineering organization to help establish satisfactory safety margins. Upon receiving the Board\u2019s final report, O\u2019Keefe reiterated NASA\u2019s intention to comply fully with the recommendations.(NASA, \u201cNASA Administrator Accepts Columbia Accident Report,\u201d news release 03-276, 26 August 2003, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/aug/HQ_03276_AOK_Acpt_CAIB.html (accessed 29 December 2008); Mark Carreau, \u201cColumbia Accident Board Casts Wide Net of Blame,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 27 August 2003; Kathy Sawyer and Eric Pianin, \u201cReport Blames Flawed NASA Culture for Tragedy,\u201d Washington Post, 27 August 2003. 504 Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 598; Justin Ray, \u201cResupply Ship Bound for the International Space Station,\u201d Spaceflight Now, 28 August 2003.)",

Using data from satellites and 7,200 weather stations worldwide, NASA and NOAA scientists had found that the global mean surface air temperature had increased by 1oF (0.6oC) during the 20th century. However, temperatures had not increased consistently but had undergone successive periods of warming (from 1900 to 1940), cooling (1940 to 1965), and warming again (1965 to 2000). The evidence also indicated that these temperature changes had not been uniform throughout Earth. For example, although the average surface air temperature in the United States had increased during the latter part of the 20th century, it had remained at a level comparable to average U.S. temperatures during the 1930s. In addition, the researchers had discovered evidence that humans had influenced surface air temperatures on a local scale in large urban areas, suburbs, and even in small towns. However, the data also indicated that this effect had been of modest magnitude and might reflect problems with data measurement.(J. Hansen et al., \u201cA Closer Look at United States and Global Surface Temperature Change,\u201d Journal of Geophysical Research 106, no.

The size of a domed football stadium, the vessel was constructed of ultra-thin plastic material, enabling it to float above 99 percent of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Scientists controlled the research craft from the ground, hoping that if it succeeded, this new type of balloon would provide a cost-effective method of gathering data. However, after a launch delay of several weeks, because of turbulent weather, the research balloon lasted aloft only a few hours before a leak forced it back to the ground. Once the balloon had reached 85,000 feet (26,000 meters), the flight controllers initiated a controlled descent, minimizing further damage to the craft and to the research instruments aboard. Engineers were optimistic that they could fix the balloon and that, once they had repaired and deployed it, the balloon would fly higher and longer than any previous research balloon. However, when the balloon landed approximately 132 miles (212 kilometers) away from its takeoff site, the launch-station director and crew remained uncertain of the nature and extent of the problem.(NASA, \u201cNASA Aborts Space Research Balloon Flight,\u201d news release 01-28, 26 February 2001; Associated Press, \u201cLeak Forces NASA Balloon To Land,\u201d 25 February 2001; Associated Press, \u201cGiant Balloon Launched After Long Delay,\u201d 24 February 2001.)",

        "story": "After months of debate over whether Russia should bring Mir out of orbit and what damage the space station might cause when it fell to Earth, the 15-year-old Mir space station plunged into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, spraying some of its remnants into the Pacific Ocean. The splashdown marked the end of a 2.2 billion-mile journey for Mir. Witnesses in Fiji reported seeing streaks of gold and silver lights across the sky when Mir fell, but nobody reported any damage from pieces of the falling space station. U.S. officials at the Pentagon tracked the descent, while Japan\u2019s public safety chief urged people to stay indoors to avoid falling debris. Anatoly Y. Solovyev, a Russian cosmonaut who had spent 651 days aboard Mir, remarked that he was sad to see the end of the pathbreaking space station: \u201cAn entire era of our Soviet space program is ending, into which we invested not only our money, but what is more important, our intellectual potential.\u201d Once Mir had descended safely, officials of the Russian Space Agency praised the precise sequence of maneuvers that had brought the space station safely from orbit.(Patrick E.

The sphere was the most distant object that a telescope had measured within Earth\u2019s solar system. Like its neighbor Pluto, the object, which is nearly 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) from Earth, lies in the Kuiper Belt, an icy debris field that extends 7 billion miles (11.3 billion kilometers) beyond the orbit of Neptune. Using the HST, scientists Michael E. Brown and Chadwick A. Trujillo were able to determine several properties of the sphere, including its diameter of 780 miles (1,250 kilometers). Although too small to be a planet, the sphere, which Brown and Trujillo named Quaoarafter a creation deity of the Native American Tongva peoplehas planet-like traits that Pluto lacks. For example, Brown and Trujillo found that Quaoar has a circular orbit around the Sun and is in the same plane as the other planets in Earth\u2019s solar system. Brown and Trujillo announced their findings at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society\u2019s Division for Planetary Sciences.(NASA, \u201cHubble Spots an Icy World Far Beyond Pluto,\u201d news release 02-190, 7 October 2002; Usha Lee McFarling, \u201cPluto\u2019s Not So Alone Out There, It Appears,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 8 October 2002.)",

Jenkins (R-TN) announced that NASA had awarded East Tennessee State University a grant valued at US$363,310 to study light patterns of stars located hundreds of light-years away. The award would grant researchers of the university\u2019s physics and astronomy department access over the next five years to data from COBEthe Cosmic Background Explorer satellite. The scientists would use the COBE data to study the infrared variability of asymptotic giant branch stars, \u201colder stars with shells of gas and dust around them.\u201d During its mission in 1989 and 1990, the COBE satellite had surveyed the sky on 10 infrared wavelengths, observing the cosmic backlight of the universe, as well as asymptotic giant branch stars. Although astronomers in the field had conducted significant research on the backlight data, they had done little with COBE\u2019s infrared data on the stars.(Sam Watson, \u201cNASA Grant To Fund ETSU Study of Stars,\u201d Johnson City Press (TN), 9 January 2003.)",

EUMETSAT\u2019s aim was to continue the data-collection mission that NASA and CNES had begun in 1992 with their ocean topography experiment, the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, and had continued with the 2001 launch of Jason 1. Jason 2 had five instruments\u2014improved versions of those aboard Jason 1\u2014 that could chart the topography of the ocean\u2019s surface, the speed and direction of the ocean\u2019s current, and the amount of solar energy the ocean stores. Scientists hoped to use these measurements to track global climate change, to hone their predictions of hurricane intensity, and to improve their understanding of currents, eddies, and tides. The project partners had scheduled Jason 2 to fly in tandem with Jason 1 for approximately six months, while engineers calibrated Jason 2\u2019s instruments. Afterwards, the two spacecraft would travel in separate orbits, doubling the global satellite coverage.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 656, 1 July 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx656.html (accessed 24 April 2011); NASA, \u201cNASA Launches Ocean Satellite To Keep a Weather, Climate Eye Open,\u201d news release 08-154, 20 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08154_OSTM-Jason-2_Launch.html (accessed 21 April 2011).)",

After conducting a complicated landing sequence and arriving safely on the surface of the asteroid Eros, the NEAR spacecraft relayed its signal to excited scientists on Earth. Called the \u201cSurprisingly Sturdy Little Spacecraft\u201d by the New York Times, NEAR survived its landing mission, surprising space officials and enthusiasts. NEAR had already spent a year orbiting the Eros asteroid, when the craft had run low on fuel. NASA\u2019s mission team directed it to land on the asteroid\u2019s surface. After NEAR\u2019s successful landing, mission managers determined that the spacecraft merited additional funding. Although the details about where NEAR would touch down remained in doubt until the last moment, the craft had landed at a location ideal for Earth controllers to send and receive signals, facilitating an extended mission.(NASA, \u201cAsteroid Mission Not Yet \u2018NEAR\u2019 an End,\u201d news release 01-20, 14 February 2001; Warren Leary, \u201cMission Extended for Surprisingly Sturdy Little Spacecraft,\u201d New York Times, 15 February 2001; Associated Press, \u201cNASA Adds 10 Days to Asteroid Mission,\u201d 15 February 2001.)",

Using a system developed at NASA\u2019s JPL, farmers would be able to access GPS data to locate points as small as 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide. Specifically, according to the agreement, NASA and John Deere\u2019s NavCom Technology Inc. had created a partnership to explore further the uses of GPS in farming. Scientists in NASA\u2019s Earth Science Enterprise believed that GPS might prove especially useful in the area of natural hazard monitoring, providing farmers with images of their land in the event of a tornado, fire, or other disaster. The pathbreaking agreement resulted from the activities of the Commercial Technology Office at JPL, which focused on exploring new ways that technologies developed by American space programs could benefit other American industries.(NASA, \u201cNASA Satellite Technology Goes Down on the Farm,\u201d news release 01-62, 8 May 2001.)",

        "story": "NASA researchers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, announced a plan to collaborate with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, to explore the potential of the substance Aerogel, which has tremendous insulating capabilities. Scientists said that they were optimistic that they could manipulate the material, rendering it transparent and, therefore, especially useful in constructing energy-efficient windows for homes and automobiles. During the 1930s, a researcher at Stanford University had discovered Aerogel, often called frozen smoke because of its hazy appearance. NASA engineers had used Aerogel as an insulating agent aboard Mars Pathfinder in 1996. Although the substance is the lightest solid known⎯only three times the density of air, a block of Aerogel weighing less than 1 pound (0.5 kilograms) can support 0.5 tons (450 kilograms or 0.45 tonnes). Aerogel\u2019s large internal surface area, which disperses heat throughout its structure, causes the material\u2019s extreme insulating capability⎯a 1-inch-thick (2.5-centimeter-thick) Aerogel window would offer the same insulation value as 15 panes of glass. John M. Horack, Assistant Laboratory Director for Space and Science Communications at MSFC, called the development of Aerogel \u201ca great example of how NASA space research generates scientific knowledge that can be used to improve the quality of life on Earth.\u201d(NASA, \u201cNASA Research in Space May Redesign Household Windows,\u201d news release 97-34, 6 March 1997. 215 Warren E.

        "story": "NASA Administer Daniel S. Goldin praised the Clinton administration\u2019s budget proposal for 1998 as a sign that NASA\u2019s deep budget cuts were leveling off. NASA had braced itself for a budget as low as US$13.1 billion, and, therefore, found President William J. Clinton\u2019s US$13.5 billion proposal a pleasant surprise. The request still entailed a US$200 million budget cut, and Congress might reduce the budget further. Nevertheless, Goldin responded to the proposed budget exuberantly, exclaiming, \u201cHoly mackerel⎯this is a great program,\u201d and remarking that for the first time during his five-year tenure, NASA could hope for budgetary stability. The proposal also projected that NASA\u2019s budget in 2000 would be approximately US$13.2 billion, rather than the US$11.6 billion forecast in previous Clinton administration proposals. NASA planned to absorb the small reduction in funding by increasing efficiency, especially in the Shuttle program, having recently transferred management of the program to the privately held United Space Alliance. NASA officials believed that NASA could continue sending up seven or eight Shuttle missions annually, if budget trends continued to stabilize. On the day of the budget announcement, however, a NASA advisory panel warned once again that a drastic decrease in the Shuttle\u2019s funding would compromise its safety. Nevertheless, Goldin maintained that the proposal would allow NASA to continue fostering \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d science.(Anne Eisele, \u201cBudget Plan Brings Stability by 2000,\u201d Space News, 10−16 February 1997; Larry Wheeler, \u201cNASA Makes Do on Slimmer Budget, Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 7 February 1997; Sean Holton, \u201cNASA Cheers Budget that Cuts Agency Only a Bit,\u201d Orlando Sentinel (FL), 7 February 1997.)",

        "story": "Astronomer Riccardo Giacconi received the Nobel Prize in physics for research on cosmic x-ray radiation. Giacconi\u2019s projects had included NASA-funded research leading to his discovery of cosmic x-ray sources. A professor at Johns Hopkins University, Giacconi had been the first scientist to discover a source of x-rays outside Earth\u2019s solar system and the first to prove that the universe contained background radiation of x-ray light. In addition, many astronomers believed that x-ray sources Giacconi had discovered contained black holes. Giacconi had also been responsible for the conception and design of the first x-ray satellite and the first operating x-ray telescope. Together with Harvey Tananbaum, he had proposed the design of the x-ray telescope that eventually became NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory. Moreover, Giacconi had been the first Director of the Hubble Space Telescope Science Institute and the Principal Investigator for the Chandra Ultra-Deep Survey, which had obtained the deepest x-ray exposures with a millionth-second observation.(NASA, \u201cNobel Physics in Physics Awarded to Astronomer for NASA-Funded Research,\u201d news release 02-197, 8 October 2002; Nobel Foundation, \u201cAdvanced Information on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2002,\u201d news release, 8 October 2002, http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2002/phyadv02.pdf (accessed 17 October 2008). 306 Gwyneth K.

ESA had designed the satellite, and Italy\u2019s Alenia Spazio had developed it, with support from more than 30 European firms. INTEGRAL would study dense objects that are sources of high-energy radiation, such as neutron stars and black holes. Project scientists hoped that INTEGRAL would produce images that would help confirm the presence of black holes at the center of galaxies, beginning with the Milky Way. INTEGRAL had two main instruments for analyzing gamma-ray sources: the Spectrometer on INTEGRAL, or SPI spectrometer, and the Imager on Board the INTEGRAL Satellite, or IBIS imager. The spectrometer and imager had an extremely sharp angular resolution, enabling them to conduct spectral analyses with an energy resolution 40 times better than that provided by any previous satellite. INTEGRAL also carried an x-ray imager and a charged-coupled device (CCD) imager that operated within the visible spectrum waveband. Using the combined data from the four instruments, project scientists would be able to make simultaneous observations of high-energy phenomena, from visible light to gamma rays.(ESA, \u201cEurope Opens a Window onto a Violent Universe,\u201d ESA news release 66-2002, 17 October 2002, http://www.esa.int/esaCP/ESAKXQTHN6D_index.0.html (accessed 2 February 2010).)",

Baganoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a team of scientists using NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory to observe a source of radio emissions called Sagittarius A* had noticed a rapid rise and decline in x-ray emissions in its vicinity. The scientists, who believed that Sagittarius A* is connected to a black hole in the center of the galaxy, speculated that the emissions emanate from matter falling into the black hole. The Chandra observations had provided the best view yet of the area just outside of the black hole\u2019s event horizon\u2015the point of no return for all matter falling into a black hole. The discovery added significantly to previous research indicating that the Milky Way Galaxy contains a black hole or some other large, dark object.(NASA, \u201cChandra Catches Milky Way Monster Snacking,\u201d news release 01-179, 5 September 2001.)",

Since its deployment, Chandra had refined scientists\u2019 knowledge of the nature of galactic nuclei, confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies like Andromeda and the Milky Way, captured images of an active starburst galaxy, analyzed the compositions of supernovas, and examined x-ray stars in the Orion Nebula. The museum also honored engineer and aviator A. Scott Crossfield with a Lifetime Achievement award. Crossfield had begun his career in the 1950s as a research pilot for NASA\u2019s predecessor agency, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and had become the first pilot to exceed Mach 2, accomplishing this feat while flying the rocket-powered Douglas D-558-2. Crossfield had joined North American Aviation in 1955 and had worked on all aspects of the X-15 program. In addition to his work on the X-15, Crossfield had developed the ground-control test methodology that became standard in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs. He had served as a division vice president at Eastern Airlines between 1967 and 1975 and, after that, as a technical advisor to the U.S. House Science Subcommittee for Transportation, Aviation, and Weather until his retirement in 1993.(Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, \u201cChandra X-ray Observatory Team and Scott Crossfield Are Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum Trophy 2000 Winners,\u201d news release, 13 November 2000, http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroom/releaseDetail.cfm?releaseID=88 (accessed 15 April 2008).)",

Images focusing on the disc (the halo of dust and gas rotating around the star) revealed that, instead of a smooth flow, one quadrant has a large bulge, indicating the orbital path of a planet that could be many times larger than Jupiter. No actual planet was visible in the images, only the effects of its gravitational pull. Nevertheless, this was the strongest evidence to date in visible light, of the presence of a possible planet. Beta Pictoris is younger (20 million to 100 million years old compared to the Sun\u2019s 4.5 to 5 billion years) and about eight times brighter than the Sun. The formation of planets around a young star suggested that planets form very early in the life of a solar system.(Washington Post, \u201cImages Support Theory of New Planet: Hubble Photos Show Bulge in Star\u2019s Halo Dust\u201463 Light-Years from Sun,\u201d 9 January 1998.)",

A close-up image of Pele showed part of the volcano glowing in the dark, with Pele\u2019s hot lava behaving similarly to active lava lakes in Hawaii. Galileo\u2019s Photopolarimeter Radiometer and Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer had provided detailed temperature maps of Loki, indicating the presence of an enormous caldera repeatedly flooded by lava. New data had clarified the location of lava from Prometheus, erupting, advancing, and producing plumes. NASA\u2019s 1979 Voyager mission had observed a plume, and early Galileo images had shown a new lava flow and plume, erupting from a location 60 miles (97 kilometers) west of the area observed during Voyager\u2019s mission.(NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \u201cJupiter\u2019s Moon Io: A Flashback to Earth\u2019s Volcanic Past,\u201d news release 99- 138, http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/99/ioishot.html (accessed 12 March 2008).)",

Federal law required GAO to provide verification of these amounts to the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology and to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. However, GAO said that NASA\u2019s lack of an integrated financial management system had prevented NASA from providing GAO with details of costs charged against these programs. GAO reported that NASA\u2019s 10 centers operated separate accounting systems, each with its own policies and practices, and that some centers could not provide complete and detailed documentation of accounts covering several fiscal years. GAO also reported that NASA officials had responded that NASA\u2019s accounts were verifiable, stating that the verification problems lay in GAO\u2019s auditing methodology rather than in NASA\u2019s system of accounting.(U.S. General Accounting Office, \u201cNASA Space Station Cost Limits\u201d (report no.

The \u201ccelestial mammoth,\u201d large enough to fill the diameter of the Earth\u2019s orbit, reportedly releases up to 10 million times the power of the Sun. The team from the University of California at Los Angeles estimated that the star, possibly as old as 3 million years, weighs up to 200 times the mass of the Sun. The team nicknamed it the Pistol Star because it has a pistol-shaped nebula. Despite the star\u2019s mass and brightness, it was not visible to the naked eye because of the interstellar dust clouds between Earth and the center of the Milky Way. Therefore, astronomers had used infrared technology to observe the star. Team researcher Mark R. Morris argued that the discovery of the massive star near the center of the galaxy would force scientists to rethink their conceptions of how stars formed in the first place.(Associated Press, \u201cSpace Monster,\u201d 8 October 1997; NASA, \u201cHubble Identifies What May Be the Most Luminous Star Known,\u201d news release 97-227, 7 October 1997.)",

        "story": "A privately funded rocket called SpaceShipOne became the first vehicle to complete a flight for the commercial spaceflight competition known as the Ansari X Prize. The X Prize competition would award US$10 million to the first private organization to create a spacecraft transporting a pilot and payload, with the equivalent weight of two passengers, to an altitude of 100 kilometers (62.1 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface, twice in two weeks. California-based Scaled Composites had built SpaceShipOne, and the company\u2019s founder Burt Rutan had designed the vehicle. The spacecraft left California\u2019s Mojave Airport at 7:11 a.m. (PST), affixed to another aircraft. The aircraft released SpaceShipOne after attaining an altitude of 48,000 feet (9.1 miles or 14.6 kilometers). Although SpaceShipOne had some difficulty during its ascent, the vehicle\u2019s pilot Michael W. Melvill was able to guide the vehicle to a peak altitude of 337,500 feet (63.9 miles or 102.9 kilometers). However, Scaled Composites would have to repeat the feat within the subsequent two weeks to win the Ansari X Prize.(Scaled Composites, \u201cSpaceShipOne Surpasses 100 Km Altitude on First X-Prize Flight,\u201d news release, 29 September 2004; Peter Pae, \u201cCraft Rolls On into Space in Bid for Prize,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 30 September 2004. 690 X PRIZE Foundation, \u201cAnsari X PRIZE,\u201d http://space.xprize.org/ansari-x-prize (accessed 12 May 2009); Scaled Composites, \u201cSpaceShipOne Captures X-Prize,\u201d 4 October 2004, http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/041004_spaceshipone_x-prize_flight_2.html (accessed 12 May 2009); John Schwartz, \u201cPrivate Rocket Ship Earns $10 Million in New Space Race,\u201d New York Times, 5 October 2004.)",

When the craft crashed into Mir, U.S. astronaut, British-born C. Michael Foale was inside the Spektr module, which he had been using as his sleeping and research quarters. Foale immediately abandoned the damaged module and slammed shut a hatch, sealing off the leaking Spektr. Spektr depressurized completely, and later the entire space station suffered a slight depressurization. When the collision occurred, Mir cosmonaut Vasili V. Tsibliyev was controlling the Progress manually, attempting to re-dock the craft, to test the updated manual-control system. The Progress had already docked with Mir a few days earlier, when the crew had unloaded cargo and filled the craft\u2019s hold with trash. In addition to damaging Mir, the collision temporarily jarred the station off its normal flying orbit. Although the crew quickly remedied this problem, the three-man team had to work inside a darkened, partially powered station. Russian and American space officials estimated that Mir had lost half of its operating power from the collision. The collision heightened tensions between Russian and American space officials, as questions mounted about the safety of the crew aboard the failing space station. U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology Chairperson F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) met with NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin, urging NASA not to send American astronauts to Mir until the station\u2019s safety standards had improved significantly. Yuri N. Koptev, Director General of the Russian Space Agency, responded angrily to Sensenbrenner\u2019s suggestion.(Michael R.

Mineta allowed commercial aircraft to resume flying in the national airspace system, the first time that the Department of Transportation had permitted aircraft to fly since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. However, Secretary Mineta also announced that the government would permit airports to reopen and flights to resume only on a case-by-case basis, pending airports\u2019 implementation of stricter security measures. Before reopening, airports would have to clear all individuals from terminals and conduct security searches. After reopening, airports would have to increase the number of law enforcement personnel at their facilities. Secretary Mineta had made the decisions after consulting with the White House and with intelligence and law enforcement officials. On the previous day, he had only allowed aircraft to use the nation\u2019s airspace if flight controllers had diverted them from their original destination or had repositioned them so that they could resume flying upon government approval.(Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), \u201cStatement of U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Y. Mineta,\u201d news release, 13 September 2001, http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsid=5431 (accessed 28 January 2010).)",

Inlaid in the floor, in colored terrazzo, was a representation of an Aztec calendar stone. The massive Willamette Meteorite squatted by the museum entrance, a pitted sculpture created according to some unreadable design. In the lobby a mural depicted the cosmology of the Blackfeet Indians. In the domed hall itself, in the days before prepackaged programming became the rule, a man would stand pointing out the stars and constellations with an arrow-shaped beam of light. And the great Zeiss projection machinery would seem, silhouetted against the heavens, to be a creature out of ''War of the Worlds.'' As the show began, twilight would gradually fall, a mock skyline of houses ringing the dome beneath the blackening sky. There was no question about where one was or who one was in that artificial cosmos. One was a child of Earth, whose surface was pocked by meteorites, whose peoples devised myths to make sense of the heavens, whose contemporary citizens could sit in a city park and learn about the constellations their ancestors had carved into the sky and whose scientists were busy revealing that sky's true shape. The Zeiss machine, a descendant of one invented in 1923 for the first modern planetarium, in Germany, was literally a projector, casting on the ceiling images in which humanity could see a reflection of itself.",

From 1935 to 1997, the New York City museum had hosted thousands of visitors annually with a less elaborate planetarium. The new planetarium was only one part of the sparkling US$210 million Rose Center for Earth and Space, which museum curator Michael M. Shara hoped would inspire future scientists. The facility, resembling a spacecraft on the outside, featured informative programming hosted by celebrities, such as actors Tom Hanks and Jodie Foster. As they walked through the new facility, visitors could observe displays demonstrating how scientists believed the universe had evolved over a period of 13 billion years.(Associated Press, \u201cMuseum Unveils Planetarium for the 21 Century,\u201d 2 February 2000.)",

The aircraft took off from the Zhukovsky Airfield south of Moscow. During the Tu-144LL flight, researchers studied the impact of excessive speeds on the aircraft\u2019s internal and exterior surfaces, engine temperature, and handling. The aircraft\u2019s body, constructed primarily from light aluminum alloy, held up well during the initial test. The Tu-144LL project supported NASA\u2019s High-Speed Research Program, which had begun in 1990, to encourage the development of technologies supporting supersonic commercial travel. The Boeing Company had led the U.S. industry involvement in the project, with support from McDonnell Douglas Aircraft, Rockwell International Corporation, Pratt & Whitney, and General Electric Company. The project\u2019s aim was to prepare flight-research facilities to adapt to market demands of the future.

        "story": "The Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation announced that McDonnell Douglas would merge with Boeing in a stock-for-stock transaction. The merger, the biggest in aerospace history, positioned Boeing to compete with Europe\u2019s Airbus Industrie for nearly all commercial airline contracts. The merger also strengthened Boeing\u2019s position as one of the most influential companies, both domestically and internationally, in the United States. The US$13.3 billion deal would place under a single umbrella nearly 200,000 employees, producing annual revenues in excess of US$48 billion. The Boeing Company also emerged from the deal with improved chances of winning major military contracts, whereas, previously, the company had few ventures involving the military aerospace industry. However, McDonnell Douglas had been the main supplier to the military of F/A-18 and F-15 Eagle-model fighter jets to the military. Thus, the merger brought together leaders in the commercial and military sectors of the aerospace industry, creating what one industry analyst called an \u201c800-pound gorilla.\u201d McDonnell Douglas stock rose 20 percent on the first day of trading following the announcement.(The Boeing Company, \u201cMcDonnell Douglas To Merge with Boeing, Combination To Be the World\u2019s Largest Aerospace Company,\u201d news release, 15 December 1996; Peter Kaplan, \u201cMission Inevitable,\u201d Washington Times, 17 December 1996; David E.

        "story": "An international team of astronomers announced the discovery of three black holes in three nondescript galaxies, suggesting that nearly all galaxies may in fact have massive black holes. Using NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the researchers took a census of 27 galaxies to find a series of black holes massive enough to consume millions of Sun-like stars. The findings, which the scientists presented in full at the 189th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, provided insight into the origin and evolution of galaxies, as well as clarifying the role of quasars in the galaxy. Douglas O. Richstone of the University of Michigan, who led the research team, stated that two of the black holes had \u201cweighed in\u201d at 50 million and 100 million solar masses, respectively. Scientists remained divided on why black holes exist so abundantly in space. One theory suggested was that, at the center of most or all galaxies, supermassive black holes exist, where gases ignite to the hottest temperatures known, sending nearby stars spiraling in new directions. Ralph Narayan of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics called the black holes \u201cthe ultimate victory of gravity.(Paul Recer, \u201cAstronomers Find Stronger Evidence of Massive Black Holes,\u201d Huntsville Times (AL), 14 January 1997; NASA, \u201cMassive Black Holes Dwell in Most Galaxies, According to Hubble Census,\u201d news release 97-9, 12 January 1997.)",

The study\u2019s principal investigator, Charles A. Czeisler of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston said that Glenn had failed to meet one of the medical criteria for the study. Czeisler did not specify the reason, and Glenn declined to elaborate. Researchers had rated the melatonin experiment as one of two top priorities among the human studies to take place during Glenn\u2019s Shuttle flight. Four members of the Shuttle flight for the Neurolab mission, which occurred earlier in 1998, had participated in the melatonin study, and Chiaki Mukai, a member of Glenn\u2019s crew, would be a fifth participant. However, Glenn\u2019s disqualification meant that the scientists would be unable to test two of their four hypotheses.(Lawrence K. Altman, \u201cGlenn Unable To Perform Experiment Planned for Space Flight,\u201d New York Times, 21 October 1998.)",

The craft\u2019s destination was an asteroid 120 million miles (193 million kilometers) away from Earth. Although tracking stations encountered initial difficulties receiving signals from the spacecraft, Deep Space 1 communicated 2 hours after liftoff that it was on \u201cthe right course\u201d and \u201cin good shape.\u201d NASA scientists expected the spacecraft to travel 450 million miles (724 million kilometers) to catch up with the moving asteroid. Without the ion-propulsion technology, it would have required 10 times more fuel to reach its target. The craft was also flying with 10 other \u201cfuturistic technologies,\u201d such as lens-covered solar arrays to generate additional power, and a radio beacon to communicate with ground controllers without their prompting the probe from Earth.(New York Times, \u201cU.S. Launches a Spacecraft That Thinks for Itself,\u201d 25 October 1998.)",

NASA planned to call the new satellite the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), in honor of former NASA Administrator James E. Webb. Under the US$824.8 million contract, TRW and its partner organizations would build an observatory capable of viewing deeper into space than the HST. The telescope\u2019s main mirror would unfold to a diameter of at least 20 feet (6.1 meters), thereby providing six times more light-gathering area than the HST, which had an 8-foot (2.4-meter) primary mirror. The telescope would also have instruments highly sensitive to infrared light, which would help astronomers understand the universe\u2019s creation and evolution. In addition, NASA planned for the new telescope to orbit 940,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, within the second Lagrange point or L2, where a spacecraft maintains a balance between the gravity of the Sun and of Earth. Although the L2 orbit would be too far from Earth to allow astronauts to service the observatory, it would enable the observatory to cool to very low temperatures without the use of complex refrigeration equipment.(NASA, \u201cNASA Announces Contract for Next-Generation Space Telescope Named After Space Pioneer,\u201d news release 02-171, 10 September 2002.)",

During floor debate preceding the vote, Senator Bumpers, who had been trying to eliminate U.S. funding for the space station for the past eight years, referred to the previous month\u2019s U.S. General Accounting Office report. The report had projected that the cost to develop, assemble, and operate the space station over several years would reach US$100 billion, in part because of recurring cost overruns. Senator John H.

The grants would help the universities establish multidisciplinary scientific, engineering, and commercial research centers, capable of making significant contributions to NASA\u2019s programs. Through the NASA Group 5 University Research Center awards program, each university would receive up to US$1 million per year for up to five years, based on their performance and on availability of funds. The awards continued NASA\u2019s commitment to supporting new aerospace science and technology concepts and expanding the nation\u2019s base for aerospace research development. Through these efforts, NASA hoped to achieve a broad-based, competitive capability for aerospace research and technology development. NASA also hoped the awards would help underrepresented minorities obtain advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Selected from among 35 institutions that had submitted proposals, the six universities to receive awards were California State University in Long Beach, for the Center for Human Factors in Advanced Aeronautics Technologies; Delaware State University in Dover, for the establishment of a NASA Optical Sciences Center for Applied Research; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, for the Center for Aviation Safety; North Carolina Central University in Durham, for the NASA Center for Aerospace Device Research and Education; University of Texas in Brownsville, for the Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy; and University of Texas in El Paso, for the Center for Space Exploration Technology Research.(NASA, \u201cNASA Awards Grants for Research Centers at 6 Minority Universities,\u201d news release 09-213, 16 September 2009, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/sep/HQ_09-213_Minority_University_Grants.html (accessed 15 September 2011).)",

The upper stage of the rocket that launched the commercially built Landsat-6 in October 1993 had failed to fire the satellite into orbit, destroying the craft and prompting NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey to resume control of the Landsat program in 1994.

Launch officials had planned to cease communications with the craft 8 minutes after liftoff and to reestablish contact later in the flight, but had not been able to reestablish contact once initial communications ended. Officials were unable to determine whether the craft had remained in orbit. Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems had built the satellite; Raytheon had built the communications, image processing, and other elements of the system; and Eastman Kodak had built the digital camera system. The camera on board Ikonos I was capable of resolving objects as small as 1 square meter (11 square feet), enabling the satellite to distinguish between a car and a truck. Before the manufacture of Ikonos, only military satellites had possessed the ability to photograph Earth in such detail.(John Antczak for Associated Press, \u201cContact Fails During Flight: Civilian Satellite Lost After Launch,\u201d 29 April 1999.)",

Although it was the sixth and last in a series of purchases of fuel tanks, this was the first purchase NASA had made consisting entirely of super lightweight tanks. The tank\u2019s design was the same as that of the lightweight tank design NASA had previously used, but the new tanks were 7,500 pounds (3,400 kilograms) lighter, and used a new aluminum lithium alloy. NASA and industry partners had developed the lighter alloy, 30 percent stronger than the material used to manufacture the lightweight tank, to enable the Shuttle to deliver ISS components into the proper orbit.(NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, \u201cNASA Completes Purchase of Material for 60 Shuttle External Tanks,\u201d news releases 99-069, 28 April 1999, http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/news/news/releases/1999/99-069.html (accessed 5 February 2008).)",

        "story": "At a NASA news conference, astronomers discussed the discovery of the largest explosion ever sighted in space. The journal Nature published three papers about the event, detected on 14 December 1997. The explosion, a gamma-ray burst (GRB) designated GRB971214, had occurred 12 billion years ago and had \u201capparently outshone all the rest of the universe\u201d for about 40 seconds. The Italian-Dutch orbiting gamma-ray observatory BeppoSAX had measured the sharp pulse of gamma rays and \u201cpinpointed the position of the rays\u2019 source.\u201d The United States\u2019 Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite had also detected the gamma-ray pulse, and scientific institutions around the world had monitored the after-effects of the explosion. Twelve hours afterward, John R. Thorstensen of Dartmouth College had used a 94-inch-diameter (49- centimeter-diameter) telescope at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona to detect a visible afterglow, which lasted for about two weeks. After the glow had faded, the scientists had discovered a faint galaxy in the same location. A team of American, Italian, and Indian astronomers, led by two California Institute of Technology scientists, used the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii to measure the distance from Earth to the source of the burst. No theorists were able to explain the explosion, and no existing models explaining GRBs could explain the amount of energy emitted from GRB971214. The scientists suggested the possibility that a superdense neutron star had ripped apart as it disappeared into a neighboring black hole, or that a violent merger of two black holes had caused the burst.(Malcolm W. Browne, \u201cAstronomers Detect Immense Explosion 2d Only to Big Bang,\u201d New York Times, 7 May 1998; NASA, \u201cMost Powerful Explosion since the Big Bang Challenges Gamma Ray Burst Theories,\u201d news release 98-75, 6 May 1998.)",

No. 106-391, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2000, GAO was required to verify NASA\u2019s accounting of its funds obligated against established budgetary limits for the ISS and for Space Shuttle support for the ISS. Under the Act, NASA\u2019s obligations were limited to US$25 billion for the ISS and US$17.7 billion for Shuttle support. GAO\u2019s report noted that NASA had not provided sufficient documentation for the amounts it had reported as obligated against budgetary limits. Thus, GAO could not verify the amounts that NASA had reported to Congress in its budget requests for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. Similarly, NASA had not reported any documentation of its FY 2004 budget obligations in its FY 2005 budget request to Congress. NASA officials acknowledged that NASA\u2019s accounting system presented some difficulties for GAO\u2019s auditors, but explained that those difficulties were the result of NASA\u2019s having reported budgetary figures based on the amount it was authorized to spend rather than on the amount it was obligated to spend.(Patty Reinert, \u201cGAO Says Lax Bookkeeping Thwarts Space Agency Audit,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 7 April 2004; U.S. General Accounting Office, \u201cInternational Space Station and Shuttle Support Cost Limits\u201d (report no.

        "story": "In the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers studying data from the Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX) reported their determination that a strange flash over the Indian Ocean, which had occurred on 20 January 2003, was not related to lightning. The researchers named the mysterious reddish glow Transient Ionospheric Glow Emission in Red, or TIGER. Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, a crew member of the ill-fated STS-107, had recorded the glow while aboard Space Shuttle Columbia, using an infrared video camera. During the Shuttle flight, Ramon had collected data about dust particles in the atmosphere for the MEIDEX Sprite campaign at the Open University in Ra\u2019anana, Israel. Researchers for MEIDEX had analyzed Ramon\u2019s video, including a single frame that showed a mysterious reddish glow 150 kilometers (93.2 miles) above the ocean near Madagascar. Like blue jets and elves, sprites are emissions\u2015transient luminous events (TLEs)\u2015that occur above thunderstorms. Airline pilots had first reported TLEs several decades ago. The TIGER phenomenon contrasted with typical TLEs because of its shape and its lack of any direct relationship to thunderstorm activity.(Maggie McKee, \u201cColumbia Crew Saw New Atmospheric Phenomenon,\u201d New Scientist, 20 January 2005; Michael Schirber, \u201cHigh-Altitude Mystery Flash Recorded by Space Shuttle,\u201d LiveScience.com, 19 January 2005, http://www.livescience.com/environment/050118_tiger_flash.html (accessed 18 August 2009).)",

NASA had scheduled a fifth servicing mission for 2004, planning to make repairs and upgrades. However, because it had grounded the Shuttle fleet following the Columbia disaster in February 2003, NASA had not performed the scheduled servicing mission. The decision about whether to service or to decommission the telescope hinged upon the expense of the mission and on NASA\u2019s budgetary allocation of funds for the mission. Joseph H. Taylor of Princeton University, head of the National Academy of Sciences committee that set priorities for planning astronomy missions for the first decade of the 21st century, testified that his committee had identified the servicing mission to the HST as a priority for NASA\u2019s space program, but only if the cost of the mission did not exceed US$400 million. Taylor stated that he would not support the mission if it would delay other programs or if NASA would have to rearrange its priorities to fund the mission. Newly revised NASA estimates placed the total cost of a fifth servicing mission at US$1 to US$2 billion, a cost that NASA\u2019s Space Science Division could not sustain on its own. Experts testifying before the committee agreed that, if the Office for Human Space Flight and the Space Sciences Division could share the expense, the mission would be well worth it.",

        "story": "NASA announced that it would join an international consortium of space agencies to support the launch of a Japanese satellite designed to create the largest astronomical instrument ever. The launch of the Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Space Observatory would create a radio telescope more than twice the diameter of the Earth, giving astronomers their sharpest view yet of the universe. Astronomers praised the Japanese-led launch as a significant advance for space research. VLBI satellites would allow radio astronomers to link together widely separated radio telescopes, so that they would function as a single instrument with extraordinarily sharp resolving power. The farther apart the telescopes, the greater would be the image\u2019s resolution. NASA equated the power of the new tool with the ability to see a grain of rice in Tokyo from Los Angeles. Scientists hoped that the new tool would allow for further exploration of active galaxies with massive black holes. Researchers also hoped that the instrument would foster understanding of the mysterious quasars, which pour out tremendous amounts of energy and host or create black holes. Creating the enormous VLBI network involved 40 radio telescopes from 15 nations. Japan\u2019s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science led the international consortium of science agencies, including NASA\u2019s JPL, the U.S. National Science Foundation\u2019s National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the Canadian Space Agency, the Australia Telescope National Facility, the European VLBI Network, and Europe\u2019s Joint Institute for VLBI.(NASA, \u201cLaunch Will Create a Radio Telescope Larger than Earth,\u201d news release 97-24, 7 February 1997; NASA, Aeronautics and Space Report of the President: Fiscal Year1996 Activities (Washington, DC, 1997), p. 25.)",

The venture eliminated market competition for launching weather satellites for NOAA, scientific satellites for NASA, spy satellites for the National Security Agency, and communications satellites for the U.S. Air Force. According to the agreement, the joint venture would produce both Boeing\u2019s Delta and Lockheed\u2019s Atlas rockets, consolidating production at Boeing\u2019s Decatur, Alabama, facility. Lockheed\u2019s Denver, Colorado, office would serve as headquarters, housing the engineering and administrative functions. Lockheed Martin\u2019s Vice President of Financial Strategies Jeffrey D.

The researchers presented their discovery of the sound waves that had rippled through the universe some 14 billion years ago. The team of the Balloon Observation of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics (BOOMERANG) project had gathered the data from a telescope aboard a balloon, which circumnavigated Antarctica at an altitude of 23 miles (37 kilometers). According to Team Leader Paolo deBernardis, the beginning of the universe left behind a residue of light and sound, providing scientists with hints about the details of the Big Bang: \u201cThe early universe is full of sound waves compressing and rarefying matter and light, much like sound waves compress and rarefy air inside a flute or trumpet.\u201d The BOOMERANG team\u2019s findings provided a new means of examining the early universe and new evidence to use in calculating how it changed. Scientists praised the discoveries as \u201cstunning and humbling\u201d evidence that cosmologists were using the correct model to describe the early universe.(NASA, \u201cNew Boomerang Findings Reveal \u2018Music\u2019 of the Early Universe,\u201d news release 01-87, 29 April 2001; Kathy Sawyer, \u201cAstronomy Peers into Face of Infant Universe,\u201d Washington Post, 30 April 2001.)",

In keeping with its 1986 agreement with the U.S. Air Force, Martin Marietta had converted 14 Titan 2 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) into space launch vehicles. The Air Force had used the converted missiles to launch weather and spy satellites into low Earth orbit; the first such converted missile launched in September 1988. The Titan 2 that launched the DMSP F16 satellite was the 13th of the 14 converted ICBMs to launch; the Air Force had no plans for the 14th converted ICBM except to hold it as a spare. The successful launch of the satellite marked the end of the 33 months of postponements of the US$450 million mission that had resulted from technical problems. The Air Force intended for the craft to track clouds, storm systems, and hurricanes, planning to use the data that the satellite collected to forecast weather and to monitor ice and snow coverage, pollution, and fires. The constellation of two primary DSMP satellites and older backups provided meteorologists with information for generating forecasts, which commanders and troops relied upon for strategic and tactical planning. DSMP F16 replaced DSMP F15, which had launched in December 1999, as the lead craft in the constellation\u2019s mid-morning orbit.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 600; Justin Ray, \u201cUS Weather Satellite Finally Escapes Grasp of Hard Luck,\u201d Spaceflight Now, 14 October 2003; Roger Fillion, \u201cTitan II Rocket Soars into Retirement,\u201d Rocky Mountain News (Denver, CO), 21 October 2003.)",

To capture most of the new images of Io, Galileo had used a fast camera mode, in which the camera preprocesses the image, averaging the brightness in its adjacent parts. However, Io\u2019s radiation had disrupted the process, degrading the quality of the images. Radiation had not affected images, including the newly released image of Pillan, taken in other camera modes. Galileo Project Manager James K. Erickson remarked that Galileo would not use the fast camera mode during the next Io flyby.(NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \u201cClosest-Ever Picture of Volcanic Moon Io Released,\u201d news release, 22 October 1999.)",

The research had focused on a small sliver of the skya deep fieldthat the Chandra X-ray Observatory had probed looking for black holes and other bodies. Based on the findings in the relatively small sampling, the researchers had estimated that the universe might contain as many as 300 million black holes. Chandra had captured images using exposure times of up to 10 days and focusing on the same region of the sky for more than one year. The astronomers believed that their new images had exposed the early history of the universe, perhaps traveling as far back in time as 90 percent of the way to the Big Bang. In examining this distant patch of sky, the researchers had discovered black holes of all types and masses.",

The successful mission, marking the first time that humankind had sent a spacecraft to the Red Planet and the first landing of an American probe on another planet, inaugurated a series of research-oriented missions to Mars. In celebrating this banner day in its history, NASA looked forward to new challenges and opportunities for the study of Mars. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin delivered a keynote address, \u201cContinuing the QuestCelebrating Viking and Looking to the Future of Mars Exploration,\u201d at the National Geographic Society\u2019s Grosvenor Auditorium in Washington, DC. Viking 1 Lander had remained on Mars for six years, gathering images and data invaluable for scientists. Following up on the success of the first probe, Viking 2 Lander had arrived on Mars\u2019s Plain of Utopia in September 1976. The two probes had taken more than 4,500 pictures while slowly crawling over Mars\u2019s surface. Perhaps as significant as the finds of Viking 1 and 2 on Mars was the fact that the probes did not find any evidence of life on the Red Planet. NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center (LaRC) had equipped both probes with biological sensors, setting a precedent for future probes to other planets to continue the search for signs of life outside of Earth. As NASA celebrated the pathbreaking Viking missions, the 2001 Mars Odyssey traveled toward the Red Planet to continue the tradition of exploring Mars\u2019s hostile but fascinating landscape.",

Scientists believed that the universe\u2019s largest known structures bounded by gravity\u2015called galaxy clusters\u2015might be the source of highly energetic and recurring explosions, which cause the clusters to behave like huge cosmic magnets. Chandra\u2019s images of the galaxy cluster Abell 2597 had revealed a cloud of hot gas with two dark circular cavities called ghost cavities, containing little x-ray or radio emissions. The images suggested that powerful explosions around a black hole in the cluster\u2019s center might have occurred when these ghost cavities expelled material from the black hole\u2019s vicinity, creating gaps in the cluster\u2019s hot gas. Scientists believed that these cavities might eventually move to the edge of the cluster, similar to the movement of air bubbles to the surface of water, thereby transporting magnetic fields to the cluster gas. The images suggested that these explosions are recurring. If the recurring explosions continue to create more cavities, this could explain the strong magnetic field of the extremely hot gas throughout the cluster.(NASA, \u201cChandra Finds Ghosts of Eruption in Galaxy Cluster,\u201d news release 02-02, 8 January 2002.)",

Adams and Laughlin had projected the future of the universe based upon quantitative theory, concluding that the Earth would die out with a whimper. According to their theory, the Sun will eventually die out, and the light of all stars will vanish. The projection was so far off in the distance (10,000 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion years from now) that it drew a mixture of criticism, amusement, and intrigue from the scientific community. Adams and Laughlin insisted that recently acquired insights into cosmic evolution had allowed them to draw conclusions about the end of the universe, albeit in broad terms. Previously, scientists had lacked even the basic data and theoretical framework necessary to undertake the task. The two researchers emphasized that they made no claim to foresee when the universe would end, but rather offered the first long-term, science-based deduction on how the universe would evolve through four periods of expansion⎯the star-filled era (the present), the degenerate era, the black- hole era, and the dark era. The ultimate result of such a progression was too difficult to estimate, according to the scholars.(John Noble Wilford, \u201cAt Other End of \u2018Big Bang\u2019, Finale May Be Big Whimper,\u201d New York Times, 16 January 1997; Tim Friend, \u201cWe\u2019ve Got 100 Trillion Years Until \u2018Lights Out\u2019 in Universe,\u201d USA Today, 16 January 1997; Associated Press, \u201cEnd of It All,\u201d 16 January 1996.)",

Veteran fighter pilot Yang Liwei expected to orbit Earth 14 times before landing. The launch was the culmination of the decade-long effort of China\u2019s secretive, military-linked space program, undertaken with the hope of improving the communist nation\u2019s image abroad, as well as among its own citizens. Chinese officials described the Shenzhou program as homegrown, but western analysts stated that Russia had provided China with important technology and training for its taikonaut (astronaut) corps. Western analysts described the Shenzhou craft as an improvement over the Russian Soyuz design, with new solar arrays enabling the front-end orbital module to remain in space after the taikonaut compartment had returned to Earth. In addition, the craft\u2019s improved collision-avoidance systems provided Shenzhou with enhanced capacity to avoid dangerous space debris.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 600; David Lynch, \u201cChina Blasts Off into Space,\u201d USA Today, 15 October 2003; Christopher Bodeen for Associated Press, \u201cChina Launches First Manned Space Mission,\u201d 15 October 2003.)",

        "story": "Scientists announced the discovery of frozen water on the Moon, calling into question the long- held belief that the Moon lacked any form of hydration. The Clementine spacecraft had found the ice while using radar signals to examine the depths of the Moon\u2019s craters. The discovery was the by-product of a US$75 million mission, co-sponsored by NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense, to test the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d sensors developed to detect and track missiles. The possible ice deposit, composed of the suspected ice crystals mixed with dirt and spread over a vast landscape, was termed a dirty lake. The scientists discovered the ice in a massive, extremely deep crater. One scientist described the crater as twice the size of Puerto Rico and deeper than the height of Mount Everest. Scientists discussing the significance of the discovery postulated that the presence of water on the Moon might be a boon to future space exploration, perhaps enabling the construction of a \u201cfilling station\u201d on the Moon. Other scientists offered a more sober opinion of the findings, referring to reports that the presence of water on the Moon might someday allow for colonization as \u201chyperbole.\u201d(John Noble Wilford, \u201cThe Moon May Have Water, and Many New Possibilities,\u201d New York Times, 4 December 1996; Associated Press, \u201cDeep Within Lunar Crater, Small Frozen Lake Is Found,\u201d 3 December 1996; Joyce Price, \u201cProspect of Ice on Moon Fires Hopes of Scientists,\u201d Washington Times, 4 December 1996; Curt Suplee, \u201cThe Moon\u2019s \u2018Dirty Lake\u2019 Makes Waves,\u201d Washington Post, 4 December 1996.)",

If you could hear sounds in space, it would have been a big bang. With the second stage of the two-part spacecraft, known as the flyby stage, watching from a safe distance, an 820-pound copper-core ''impactor'' craft smashed into the nucleus of comet Tempel 1 at 23,000 miles an hour, sending a huge spray of debris into space.",

The Deep Impact spacecraft\u2015one of a series of low-cost space science ventures developed under the NASA Discovery Mission\u2015consisted of two vehicles: an impactor and a flyby vehicle. NASA had designed the impactor to crash into Tempel 1, thereby exposing the comet\u2019s internal material, and to capture images of the comet until just seconds before impact. NASA intended the flyby vehicle to capture images of Tempel 1\u2019s substrata, the internal material of the comet that the impactor\u2019s crash would expose, and to conduct chemical analyses of comet debris ejected during the crash.(Guy Gugliotta, \u201cNASA Succeeds in Crashing Craft into Comet,\u201d Washington Post, 5 July 2005; NASA, \u201cDeep Impact: Mission to a Comet, Spacecraft and Instruments,\u201d http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ deepimpact/mission/index.html (accessed 12 June 2009).)",

Scientists intended to supplement peer-reviewed research on sleep disorders, muscle atrophy, balance, and clinical evaluations of blood and heart function with data collected during Discovery\u2019s planned October mission. Senator Glenn had undergone medical tests with NASA physicians, as well as with independent consultants, all of whom had determined that Glenn was medically qualified for spaceflight, with an excellent fitness level.

Tsibliyev, had an irregular heartbeat and, according to Russian Mission Control, a problem with his \u201ccardiovascular system.\u201d The tests, indicating that Tsibliyev was overtired and suffering from stress, did not surprise space officials, considering his traumatic experience of late June, when a cargo craft had crashed into Mir. Tsibliyev reported that he had felt \u201cirregularities\u201d while he was exercising and when he was trying to sleep. The news of crew health problems complicated further the arduous repair plan. A day after learning of Tsibliyev\u2019s test results, Russian officials proposed that U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale take Tsibliyev\u2019s place in the repair spacewalk. NASA subsequently deliberated over the request before granting Foale permission to participate. Ultimately, however, Russian Mission Control decided not to allow Mir\u2019s exhausted crew to perform the tasks. Instead, Mission Control planned for the replacement crew scheduled to arrive in August 1997 to make the repairs. The response to the latest of Mir\u2019s challenges demonstrated an increasingly dependent and trusting partnership between the Russian and American space agencies. During the Soviet-led race for space, few could have imagined Russian officials asking for the aid of an American crew member in a time of crisis.(Paul Hoversten, \u201cLatest Mir Trouble: Commander\u2019s Heart,\u201d USA Today, 15 July 1997; Michael Gordon, \u201cRussians Suggest American Take On Mir Repair Task,\u201d New York Times, 16 July 1997; Associated Press, \u201cCommander of Russian Space Station Shows Heart Irregularities,\u201d 14 July 1997; Reuters, \u201cTests on Mir Commander Show Cardiovascular Problem,\u201d 14 July 1997; Associated Press, \u201cBacks to the Wall, Russians Ask for Help from American Astronaut,\u201d 15 July 1997; Reuters, \u201cNASA Approves Mir Spacewalk Training for Foale,\u201d 17 July 1997; New York Times, \u201cA Rescue Assignment for NASA,\u201d editorial, 17 July 1997; Associated Press, \u201cMir Crew Gets Disappointing News; Next Crew To Do Key Repairs,\u201d 19 July 1997.)",

        "story": "As part of Expedition 6, American astronauts Donald D. Pettit and Kenneth R. Bowersox undertook a spacewalk outside the ISS, each spacewalking for the first time, while their Russian colleague Nikolai M. Budarin monitored their work from inside the station. Pettit had replaced Budarin in the spacewalk lineup because NASA doctors were concerned about Budarin\u2019s known cardiovascular issues. In the summer of 2003, Pettit had served as backup for another astronaut in an ISS mission, because NASA doctors were worried about that astronaut\u2019s radiation exposure. NASA had decided to replace Budarin even though Russian doctors disagreed, because NASA was in charge of this spacewalk. During the 7-hour spacewalk, the two astronauts successfully completed their primary tasksreleasing locks on a recently installed radiator and cleaning a docking ring. However, they were unable to erect a light on a boom, because a protruding pin prevented the boom from swinging out of its stowed position.(Associated Press, \u201cAstronauts Take Spacewalk, Including a Late Substitute Who Frees the Space Station\u2019s Sticky Hatch,\u201d 15 January 2003.)",

Tumlinson\u2019s organization advocated limiting NASA\u2019s role to supporting technology and research programs. He proposed commercializing the Shuttle fleet and privatizing NASA field centers, to reduce the costs of space exploration and eventual colonization. Goldin advocated reducing costs as well, but did not respond to Tumlinson\u2019s proposals. He also outlined new technologies that NASA was developing, to cut the cost of rockets and satellites. Goldin remarked that NASA \u201cwould form partnerships with industry for \u2018cutting-edge research development\u2019,\u201d also emphasizing NASA\u2019s support of government loans to fuel the growth of the space industry in the United States.(Frank Sietzen Jr. for United Press International, \u201cUPI Science News,\u201d 2 October 1998; Frank Sietzen Jr. for United Press International, \u201cNASA Urged To Sell Shuttles,\u201d 1 October 1998.)",

        "story": "Scientists at the American Astronomical Society convention also unveiled the first detailed map of the region of the universe inhabited by Earth. Using an Australian robotic telescope, which measured distances between more than 100,000 galaxies, researchers had charted the locations of galaxies, dark regions, and cosmic clusters. Perhaps most significantly, the new map supported a long-standing theory regarding the size limits of cosmic structures. Because of the relatively small scope of previous mapping surveys, scientists had questioned whether the known standards of cosmic size were representative. The newest map, however, did not reveal any cosmic structure outside of previous standards. Therefore, scientists could support with greater conviction the idea that size limits existed as the universe evolved. The researchers termed the limits the \u201cend of greatness.\u201d(James Glanz, \u201cRobotic Telescope Affirms Assumption on Universe\u2019s Birth,\u201d New York Times, 7 June 2000. 933 Mark Carreau, \u201cRocket Gives Space Station a Life,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 7 June 2000.)",

Yeltsin presented state medals to several dozen cosmonauts and space officials during a Cosmonaut\u2019s Day ceremony. Yeltsin briefly praised Mir\u2019s achievements in his remarks at the Kremlin, but when Director General of the Russian Space Agency Yuri N. Koptev presented him with a model of the new ISS, Yeltsin asked Koptev whether Mir would stay aloft. Koptev responded in the affirmative, but explained during a press conference afterward that private investors had not yet produced funds for Mir\u2019s continued operation. Vitaly I. Sevastyanov, a lawmaker and former cosmonaut, called on Russians to contribute money to a charity formed to keep Mir in orbit.(Vladimir Isachenkov for Associated Press, \u201cMir,\u201d 12 April 1999.)",

The crew believed that the obstruction was a rubber seal from a supply ship that had left the ISS on 22 November. NASA had delayed the launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour for five days because of concern that Endeavour\u2019s arrival at the space station could cause the insecurely docked supply ship to wobble, possibly damaging the ISS. However, Dezhurov and Tyurin were able to remove the obstruction during their 3-hour spacewalk, thereby clearing the way for Endeavour to launch on 5 December.(Warren E.

        "story": "NASA reported that a team of scientists from Johnson Space Center and Stanford University had found evidence that \u201cstrongly suggested\u201d that primitive life existed on the planet Mars. During a two-year study, the researchers discovered what they believed to be organic molecules of Martian origin on a potato-sized meteorite, which members of the National Science Foundation\u2019s Antarctica Meteorite Program had found in 1984. Scientists estimated that the meteorite was about 4.5 billion years old. According to the team\u2019s report, published in Science magazine, the remnants on the meteorite shared several mineral characteristics indicating biological activity, possibly even containing microscopic fossils of primitive, bacteria-like organisms. The minute scale of the evidence required the careful research of the team of specialists in the fields of microbiology, mineralogy, and chemistry. The largest of the possible fossils measured about 1/100th the diameter of a human hair. Only with recently developed technological instruments, including a dual-laser mass spectrometer, were the scientists able to make any substantial observations.112 The announcement generated immediate excitement in the scientific community and in the mass media, although some scientists responded with a multitude of critical questions. The researchers carefully qualified their report, stating, \u201cIt is very difficult to prove life existed 3.6 billion years ago on Earth, let alone on Mars.\u201d113 NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin pledged to make samples of the meteorite available to scientists throughout the world, to encourage a full scientific investigation.(McKay et al., \u201cSearch for Past Life on Mars,\u201d 924\u2013930; NASA, \u201cMeteorite Yields Evidence\u201d; Sawyer, \u201cNASA Releases Images.\u201d)",

Each in its own tragic way represents a pivotal moment in space exploration. The two most recent disasters continue to haunt the program with lost momentum and persistent doubts about its value and future direction. Thirty-nine years ago, on Jan. 27, 1967, the three astronauts of Apollo 1 lost their lives in a fire on the launching pad. The training accident set back the successful attainment of the goal to land men on the Moon by the end of the decade, but did not prevent it.",

More specifically, the new law directed NASA\u2019s Administrator to ensure that NASA would pursue a balanced set of programs related to aeronautics research and development, human spaceflight, and scientific research\u2015including robotic missions to the Moon. Among the specific programs the law directed NASA to pursue was the launch of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) at a date as close to 2010 as possible, and the landing of Americans on the Moon by 2020. Both objectives were components of the Vision for Space Exploration.

NEAR was the first spacecraft successfully to orbit an asteroid and to provide detailed data about it. Even in its first year, the NEAR spacecraft had exceeded expectations, gathering 10 times more data than scientists had forecast. Traveling more than 2 billion miles (3.2 billion kilometers), NEAR had captured 11 million laser pulses; x-ray, gamma- ray, and infrared readings; and approximately 160,000 images of Eros. With its initial objectives accomplished, the NEAR team focused on accomplishing another firsta controlled descent of the spacecraft onto the asteroid. Astronomers hoped that the landing would gather close-up images, otherwise impossible to obtain. With the low-cost and efficient spacecraft nearly out of fuel, NEAR Mission Director Robert W. Farquhar explained that NEAR\u2019s landing was a final attempt to glean as much as possible from the endeavor. Said Farquhar, \u201cWith the spacecraft just about out of fuel and our science objectives met, this is a great way to end a successful mission. It\u2019s all bonus science . . . at this point the only real risk is not taking one.\u201d(NASA, \u201cNEAR Mission Completes Main Task, Now Will Go Where No Spacecraft Has Gone Before,\u201d news release 01-13, 31 January 2001.)",

The discovery increased the total number of known satellites around Jupiter to 39, more than any other planet in the solar system. Using the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, astronomers from Cambridge University and the University of Hawaii had first detected the moons in December 2001. At 1- to 2-miles (1.6- to 3.2-kilometers) across, the newly discovered moons were far smaller than some of Jupiter\u2019s other moons, which are thousands of miles (or kilometers) wide. In addition, the astronomers had discovered that the satellites have irregular orbits and, unlike the planet\u2019s largest moons, spin in the opposite direction of Jupiter. The moons\u2019 irregular orbits around Jupiter indicate that they may have originally orbited the Sun.(Usha Lee McFarling, \u201c11 New Moons of Jupiter Found,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 17 May 2002; NASA JPL, \u201cAstronomers Discover 11 More Small Moons of Jupiter,\u201d news release, 17 May 2002.)",

Collins, NASA\u2019s first female Shuttle commander in 38 years of human spaceflight. Commander Collins\u2019s crew comprised Pilot Jeffrey S. Ashby and Mission Specialists Steven A. Hawley, Catherine G. Coleman, and Michel Tognini. Columbia carried on board the US$1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory, previously known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), as well as secondary payloads and experiments⎯the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System to capture ultraviolet imagery of the Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter; plant growth experiments; biological cell-culture studies; and the Treadmill Vibration Information System and High Definition Television System, which the crew planned to test. NASA had scrubbed both of the Shuttle\u2019s earlier launch attempts late in the countdown, halting the 20 July launch 6 seconds before blastoff because of a technical malfunction and the 22 July launch because of stormy weather. The U.S. Air Force and the Boeing Company postponed a commercial launch to permit NASA a third chance to deliver Chandra into orbit. However, the Shuttle continued to have problems. During the 8-minute climb into outer space, a 0.5-second-long short circuit shut down computers controlling two of the Shuttle\u2019s three main engines. Furthermore, Columbia was 4,000 pounds (1,800 kilograms) short of liquid oxygen fuel in its external fuel tank, leaving the craft in orbit 7 miles (11 kilometers) lower than planned. Fuel carried aboard the orbiter made up the shortfall. Seven hours into the flight, the crew deployed Chandra into orbit, accomplishing its primary mission.(USA Today, \u201cShuttle Lifts Off with Woman in Command,\u201d 23 July 1999; Brad Liston for Reuters, \u201cShuttle Roars into History After Launch Problems,\u201d 23 July 1999; Beth Dickey, \u201cAfter Hiccup at Liftoff, Shuttle Puts Telescope into Space,\u201d New York Times, 25 July 1999; NASA, \u201cMission Archives STS-93, Chandra X-ray Observatory,\u201d http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-93.html (accessed 29 October 2008).)",

Anderson worked from inside the space station to move the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 (PMA-3) from its port-side perch on NASA\u2019s Unity module to a berth facing Earth. The crew had delayed the relocation process by approximately 1 hour, because three of the sixteen bolts securing the PMA had returned intermittent fault messages. However, Mission Control determined that the error messages would not affect the relocation or the installation of the Harmony node later in the year. Kotov assisted Anderson in operating the ISS\u2019s robotic arm, while Yurchkhin oversaw the bolt-latching systems, alternately freeing and securing the module during its relocation. PMA-3 detached from Unity at 8:23 a.m. (EDT) and, at 9:07 a.m. (EDT), the crew successfully reattached the port to its new berth. NASA\u2019s lead Expedition 15 Flight Director Robert C. Dempsey acknowledged the cooperation between the Russian and American crew members. Dempsey remarked that Expedition 15\u2019s crew was one of the first truly integrated crews that he had seen, noting that the mission marked the first time that Russian cosmonauts had operated NASA-controlled components, such as the Canadian-built robotic arm.(Tariq Malik, \u201cSpace Station Crew Clears Port for New Module,\u201d Space.com, 30 August 2007, http://www.space. com/missionlaunches/070830_exp15_pma3move.html (accessed 30 June 2010).)",

''Let's face it, they have some serious air pollution problems,'' said Eric Keil, a wholesale nurseryman who manages Otto Keil Florist in Huntington, N.Y. He helped arrange the delivery. ''I don't know how much the plants can do -- but it's got to help some.''",

In particular, boys' costumes, which traditionally tend toward a guts-and-gore theme, are being toned down. And while fire and police outfits were the immediate favorites in September, more recently a variety of other patriotic costumes have become the top choice: army uniforms and Uncle Sam suits are leading the pack. ''People are now seeking looks that show pride in New York and in America,'' said Sharon Sternheim, owner of Zittles toy store on Madison Avenue and 76th Street. ''Last week, we sold out of military camouflage, the American flag and the Statue of Liberty within days.'' According to Ms. Sternheim, parents who prefer less violent or nationalistic looks for their offspring are opting for costumes of astronauts ($35), NASA pilots ($35) and American legends like Davy Crockett ($65). And while standards like Superman and Batman are having moderate success, Ms. Sternheim said, at the moment customers ''want real-life heroes, not make-believe ones.''",

For their time, these shoe box-size biochemistry laboratories were marvels of miniaturization and engineering. But they didn't resolve the issue of whether there is or was life on Mars. In retrospect, they may not have been sensitive enough. The instruments didn't find any significant organic molecules, but given what else was discovered about Mars on those missions, that was hardly surprising. The Martian surface was found to be so reactive that most organic molecules that did exist would be rapidly destroyed. So only instruments with much greater sensitivity than those on the landers would be able to detect the extremely small concentrations of molecules that might remain.",

The eruption in the galaxy cluster MS 0735.6+7421 had been in process for more than 100 million years, generating energy equal to that of hundreds of millions of gamma- ray bursts (GRBs). In the past, scientists had usually detected the rapid growth of supermassive black holes by observing very bright radiation from galaxies. However, MS 0735.6+7421 had no detectable bright, central radiation, and the galaxy cluster\u2019s radio jets were faint. Chandra\u2019s x-ray observations of the hot cluster gas had revealed the true nature of the black hole. Michael R. Wise of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology remarked that, until Chandra had captured this information, scientists had no idea that the black hole was \u201cgorging itself.\u201d Chandra\u2019s discovery demonstrated that, to observe and understand some of the most violent events in the universe, astronomers need x-ray telescopes.(NASA, \u201cMost Powerful Eruption in the Universe Discovered,\u201d news release 05-004, 5 January 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/jan/HQ_05004_chandra.html (accessed 11 May 2009).)",

Although the report maintained that the overall safety of NASA\u2019s operations remained within an acceptable range, the investigators warned that the use of contractors and the lack of oversight compromised the quality of NASA\u2019s missions. NASA\u2019s chief of the Office of Space Flight accepted the report\u2019s recommendations to improve NASA\u2019s operations, also noting, however, that NASA had already investigated and dealt with many of the weaknesses highlighted in the report. With budgetary matters always a pressing concern, NASA had made various necessary reductions in personnel, relying on companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin more than ever. NASA had initiated the investigation to understand more fully the impact of the changes on NASA\u2019s highest priority⎯the safety of its astronauts.(Associated Press, \u201cNASA Says Shuttle Cuts Have Led to Higher Risk,\u201d 10 March 2000; Los Angeles Times, \u201cStudy Raises Concerns About Shuttle Safety,\u201d 13 March 2000.)",

ESA, the Italian Space Agency, and NASA had launched the mission in 1997 to study Saturn and its moons. Even though it is too cold to support life, scientists remain greatly interested in Titan, because they suspect that conditions on the planet are similar to those on Earth before the development of life.(ESA, \u201cCassini-Huygens Makes First Close Approach to Titan,\u201d ESAnews release, 26 October 2004.)",

One can only marvel at the fantastic precision of the computerized technologies that allowed the robotic Spirit rover to land near the center of its target area in a vast crater the size of Connecticut. Space is a very demanding environment where, even if thousands of things go right, a single mishap can doom the whole mission. Scientists were holding their collective breath late Saturday when the Spirit turned its heat shield downward, deployed its parachute, jettisoned the shield, fired its retrorockets, inflated its air bags, bounced high off the surface and rolled to a stop, upright and in a seemingly perfect position to study what is described as a ''scientific sweet spot.'' Yesterday scientists said they were thrilled at how well the instruments were checking out after all that shaking. They proudly displayed the first three-dimensional photographs from the surface. What a welcome change after a number of discouraging failures over the past several decades! All told, more than half of all Mars probes launched by Earth's spacefaring nations have ended in disaster, either blowing up in Earth orbit, losing their way in space or crashing or conking out on the Martian surface. The Russians have had the most misfires, but even the United States lost two orbiters and a lander because of malfunctions and human error. In the latest forays, a Japanese spacecraft failed to reach Mars orbit, while a British landing craft appears to have been lost on the surface. It is no wonder that Mars has been dubbed the dark planet for space vehicles.",

The robotic rover Spirit was one of two mobile laboratoriesMars Exploration Roversthat NASA had designed to collect and analyze geological samples on Mars. Analysis of the samples would help scientists determine whether the planet had previously possessed water and the ability to support life. The twin rovers, part of NASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Program, would land at sites on opposite sides of the planet, where scientists believed that liquid water might have existed in the past. To conduct geological research on the planet, NASA scientists had equipped each rover with a microscopic imager, a panoramic camera, and a variety of spectrometers. NASA had scheduled Opportunity, the second rover, to land on Mars later in January.(NASA, \u201cSpirit Lands on Mars and Sends Postcards,\u201d news release 2004-003, 4 January 2004; NASA, \u201cMars Exploration Rover Mission: Summary,\u201d http://marsrover.nasa.gov/overview/ (accessed 11 January 2009).)",

        "story": "The first Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), the product of a long-term program designed to provide military and other satellites with enduring, reliable access to space, launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Lockheed Martin had developed the rocket, called the Atlas 5. The EELV placed the European television satellite Hot Bird 6 in its preliminary orbit 31 minutes after its launch, and the satellite\u2019s thrusters later maneuvered it into its final orbit. The EELV program had resulted from the U.S. government\u2019s research into the 1986 Challenger disaster. The U.S. Air Force had reportedly paid Lockheed Martin and the Boeing Company more than US$500 million each to design an EELV. The U.S. Air Force had requested an EELV that was an advanced version of existing rockets, rather than an entirely new system, estimating that, through 2020, the EELV could reduce the cost of placing military satellites into orbit by approximately US$10 billion. France-based Eutelsat (European Telecommunications Satellite Organization) owned the Hot Bird 6 broadcast satellite, which Alcatel Space had built.(William Harwood, \u201cInto Space, A New Kind of Rocket,\u201d Washington Post, 22 August 2002; Lockheed Martin, \u201cInaugural Atlas V Scores Success for ILS, Lockheed Martin,\u201d news release, 21 August 2002, http://www. lockheedmartin.com/news/press_releases/2002/InauguralAtlasVScoresSucceslForILSL.html (accessed 28 January 2010).)",

NASA\u2019s 253-pound (114.8-kilogram) Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (EOS ACRIM III), expected to return data for a minimum of five years, was deployed to measure sunlight reaching Earth\u2019s atmosphere, oceans, and land, data needed for scientists to study whether slight changes in solar output affected global warming and cooling. ACRIM III was the third in a series of long- term, solar-monitoring tolls that NASA\u2019s JPL had built. ACRIM III\u2019s data would expand the database begun with the ACRIM I mission in 1980, aboard the Solar Maximum Mission spacecraft, and continued with the ACRIM II mission in 1991, aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. ACRIM I was the first instrument to demonstrate clearly that the total radiant energy from the Sun is not a constant. The Korean satellite, built by TRW Inc. for a three-year mission, carried three instruments for creating digital elevation maps of Korea, studying the biology of the ocean, and performing physics experiments on the effects of radiation on electronics. The Celestis mission carried 36 capsules of human remains, which would orbit for 45 years before burning up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.(NASA, \u201cItem 1⎯ACRIMSAT Launch⎯HQ,\u201d NASA Daily News Summary, 21 December 1999, http://www. nasa.gov/home/hqnews/media/1999/m99-262.txt (accessed 13 March 2008); Associated Press, \u201cNASA Satellite, Korea Probe Rocket into Space,\u201d 21 December 1999.)",

The researchers had used the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the HST to observe galaxy NGC 4631, some 25 million light-years from Earth. The discovery not only revealed the increasing power of the astronomical tools at the disposal of scientists, but also contributed to astronomers\u2019 knowledge about the structure and evolution of galaxies. Wang explained the significance of the discovery: \u201cScientists have debated for over 40 years whether the Milky Way has an extended corona, or halo, of hot gas . . . by studying similar galaxies like NGC 4631, we can get an idea of what\u2019s going on within our own galaxy.\u201d The study\u2019s results also provided new information about how energy and mass spin around galaxies, as well as about the possible effects of rapid star formation.(NASA, \u201cChandra Detects Halo of Hot Gas Around Milky Way\u2013Like Galaxy,\u201d news release 01-146, 19 July 2001.)",

        "story": "NASA\u2019s Stardust mission return capsule landed at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range at 5:10 a.m. (EST). The spacecraft, which had launched on 7 February 1999, flying 2.88 billion miles (4.63 billion kilometers) and circling the Sun three times, was the first to bring comet material from outer space. On 2 January 2004, Stardust had flown within 149 miles (239.79 kilometers) of comet Wild 2\u2019s nucleus, to collect microscopic dust particles. During the voyage, the spacecraft had captured bits of interstellar dust streaming into the solar system from other parts of the galaxy. NASA expected that the 100-pound (45.36-kilogram) capsule ejected from Stardust would contain approximately 1 million samples of comet and interstellar dust particles, trapped in a material like spun glass, called aerogel. NASA would transfer the capsule to a laboratory at its Johnson Space Center (JSC), where scientists would examine the samples. According to Principal Investigator for the mission, Donald E. Brownlee, of the University of Washington, Seattle, \u201cthis has been a fantastic opportunity to collect the most primitive material in the solar system. We fully expect some of the comet particles to be older than the Sun.\u201d(Guy Gugliotta, \u201cStardust Capsule Brings First Comet Sample to Earth,\u201d Washington Post, 17 January 2006; Warren Leary, \u201cSpace Capsule Bearing Comet Dust Lands in Utah,\u201d New York Times, 17 January 2006; NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s Comet Hunter on Final Approach for Sunday Landing,\u201d news release 06-028, 12 January 2006, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/jan/HQ_06028_stardust.html (accessed 14 September 2009).)",

Urban areas can be as much as 20 degrees hotter than nearby rural ones, a result, among other factors, of all that concrete and asphalt pumping out heat as sunlight hits it. Sweltering temperatures affect humans, of course, but are there other biological consequences of what are known as urban heat islands? A study by Michael J. Angilletta Jr. of Indiana State University and colleagues shows that there is. Urban ants, they report in PLoS Biology, can stand the heat better than those from out of town.",

Once in place, the new robotic arm would allow the ISS crew to lift spacewalkers to every part of the ISS\u2019s exterior to perform maintenance and repairs.

The agreement among the space agencies of Canada, Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States followed months of disagreement regarding the safety and propriety of allowing the wealthy American businessman to purchase passage into space for US$20 million. Without conferring with NASA or with other members of the ISS Partnership, the Russian Space Agency had made an agreement with Tito permitting him to take a place on Russia\u2019s Soyuz spacecraft. NASA had protested against including an individual who was not a trained astronaut on the spaceflight at such an early point in the ISS\u2019s development. After Russia had reached the agreement with Tito, he had undergone months of training. The ISS Partnership required Tito to sign a waiver absolving NASA of any liability for his safety and required him to promise that he would pay for anything he damaged. The ISS Partnership also announced plans to formalize the criteria for future visits to the station.(Warren E.

The finding suggested that many near-Earth asteroids could be binaries. The images, taken by NASA\u2019s Goldstone telescope facility and the National Science Foundation\u2019s Arecibo Observatory, revealed that the asteroid was not one, but two objects, a nearly 800-meter-diameter (2,625-foot-diameter) primary and an almost 300-meter-diameter (985-foot-diameter) secondary, revolving around their common center of mass. The researchers suggested that approximately 16 percent of near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters (655 feet) in diameter could be binary systems. In addition, the analysis suggested that binaries with similar orbits might result from a close encounter of an asteroid and a planet, in which the planet\u2019s gravitational pull breaks off a portion of the asteroid. Scientists consider binary asteroids potential hazards to Earth and worthy of further study.(J. L.

Between the waves is an even greater volume of invisible matter, and in those immense intergalactic stretches and depths lies a substantial amount of the universe's ''missing mass.'' As far as astrophysicists can tell, less than 1 percent of the mass of the universe has revealed itself through visible light and other detectable radiations. The rest cannot be detected directly, and is only inferred to exist from the gravitational effects it appears to exert on the galaxies. Scientists have been seeking this mysterious dark matter for decades.",

Bain and a team of researchers used reels of archived film, models, and computer simulations to reach the conclusion that the outside of the Hindenburg had caught fire first. Because the Nazi government viewed the Hindenburg accident as an embarrassment, Germany had restricted the investigation into the explosion, which caused the deaths of the 35 passengers. The cover-up had led researchers to propose the scientifically unconvincing theory of a hydrogen fire.(Reuters, \u201cPaint Led to Hindenburg AirshipTragedy,\u201d 23 April 1997.)",

Glenn Jr. The primary objectives of STS-95 included conveying a variety of science experiments inside the SPACEHAB module; deploying and retrieving the Spartan free-flyer payload; performing operations with the HST Orbiting Systems Test; and transporting the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker payloads. The historic mission also returned veteran astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. to space. Thirty-six years after Glenn had first orbited Earth, the seventy-seven-year-old astronaut became the oldest person to fly in orbit. As a veteran of NASA\u2019s early Mercury program, Glenn had been the first American to orbit Earth. On 20 February 1962, in a flight lasting 5 hours, Glenn had orbited Earth three times in a tiny capsule. After he had passed a battery of medical tests and participated in astronaut training, NASA had selected U.S. Senator John H. Glenn Jr. as a crew member of STS-95, so that scientists could study \u201chow space travel affects an aging astronaut\u2019s body.\u201d(Bill Sammon, \u201cSenator Upholds Status as Hero with His Return to Orbit,\u201d Washington Times, 30 October 1998; John Noble Wilford, \u201cPioneer Returns as Crewman in the Shuttle,\u201d New York Times, 29 October 1998; NASA, \u201cMission Archives: STS-95, John Glenn\u2019s Flight; SPACEHAB,\u201d http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-95.html (accessed 20 October 2008).)",

But since the 1970's, rings have been discovered around Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. The most recent discovery, of two faint bands of dust outside the main ring system of Uranus, was made using the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003. Imke de Pater of the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues have studied these newest rings and found that the outermost one holds a surprise. It's one of only two blue rings in the solar system.",

Inflation theory posits that, at the outset of the Big Bang, approximately 13.7 billion years ago, the universe underwent a rapid expansion. According to WMAP researcher David N. Spergel, \u201cduring this growth spurt, a tiny region, likely no larger than a marble, grew in a trillionth of a second to become larger than the visible universe.\u201d The rapid inflationary expansion converted quantum fluctuations\u2014short- lived bursts of energy at the subatomic level\u2014into fluctuations of matter that ultimately enabled the formation of stars and galaxies. WMAP, first launched in 2001, was providing observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the afterglow light produced when the universe was less than a million years old. The first WMAP data, released in 2003, had focused on the temperature variations of this light, providing an accurate age of the universe and insights into its geometry and composition. The new WMAP observations provided not only a more detailed temperature map, but also the first full-sky map of the polarization (the way light is changed by the environment through which it passes) of the CMB.(NASA, \u201cNASA Satellite Glimpses Universe\u2019s First Trillionth of a Second,\u201d news release 06-097, 16 March 2006, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/mar/HQ_06097_first_trillionth_WMAP.html (accessed 14 September 2009); Ker Than, \u201cAstronomers Detect First Split-Second of the Universe,\u201d Space.com, 16 March 2006, http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060316_wmap_results.html (accessed 12 July 2010); Dennis Overbye, \u201cAstronomers Find the Earliest Signs Yet of a Violent Baby Universe,\u201d New York Times, 17 March 2006.)",

        "story": "A team of international astronomers, led by Aki Roberge of NASA\u2019s GSFC, reported in Nature that, using NASA\u2019s Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) telescope, they had discovered that the disc surrounding the Beta Pictoris star, initially discovered in 1984, is extremely rich in carbon. Beta Pictoris is approximately 60 light-years away from Earth and relatively young\u20148 to 20 million years old. The HST\u2019s earlier observations had indicated that a Jupiter-like planet might have already formed in the star\u2019s disc and that rocky terrestrial planets might be forming. Roberge\u2019s team reported that the disc contained nine times as much carbon as oxygen, which is twice the ratio found in the Sun or in Beta Pictoris itself. The scientists proposed one possible explanation for the high carbon content: that the disc is in a transient, carbon-rich phase. In its earliest period of development, Earth\u2019s solar system could have gone through a phase similar to that of the disc surrounding Beta Pictoris. Alternatively, if researchers were to discover in the future that the asteroids and comets orbiting Beta Pictoris contained large amounts of carbon-rich material, such as graphite and methane, such a finding could indicate the formation of carbon planets very different from Earth.(Maggie McKee, \u201cStar\u2019s Dusty Disc Could Create Exotic Worlds,\u201d New Scientist, 8 June 2006; NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s Fuse Finds Infant Solar System Awash in Carbon,\u201d news release 06-236, 7 June 2006, http://www.nasa.gov/home/ hqnews/2006/jun/HQ_06236_FUSE_0607_final.html (accessed 23 August 2010); see also Aki Roberge et al., \u201cStabilization of the Disk Around β Pictoris By Extremely Carbon-Rich Gas,\u201d Nature 441 (8 June 2006): 724−26.)",

That's the conclusion of Hideaki Miyamoto of the University of Tokyo and colleagues, who see evidence of vibrations at work in images of the asteroid's gravel-strewn surface. The close-up images were taken in 2005 by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa as it hovered over and touched down briefly on the 1,000-foot asteroid in a sample-return mission. The images show the kinds of gravel migration, alignment and sorting that can be caused by shaking, and are often seen on Earth along riverbeds or after landslides.",

The Lockheed Martin\u2013built SIRTF was the fourth and final of NASA\u2019s Great Observatories, following the HST, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. NASA had designed the 110-pound (50-kilogram), 33.5-inch (85-centimeter) telescope to measure heat from celestial objects. SIRTF would study some of the same deep space objects as the other Great Observatories, as well as studying other parts of the cosmos. Michael Jura, SIRTF interdisciplinary scientist for planetary science at the University of California at Los Angeles, remarked that one of SIRTF\u2019s main scientific goals was to develop a better understanding of star and planet formation. The project, originally proposed in the mid- 1970s, had faced repeated budgetary cutbacks and delays. NASA planned for SIRTF\u2019s mission to last a minimum of 30 months, at an anticipated cost of US$1.19 billion.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 598; Associated Press, \u201cNASA Launches Rocket with Infrared Scope,\u201d 25 August 2003. 154)",

In particular, boys' costumes, which traditionally tend toward a guts-and-gore theme, are being toned down. And while fire and police outfits were the immediate favorites in September, more recently a variety of other patriotic costumes have become the top choice: army uniforms and Uncle Sam suits are leading the pack. ''People are now seeking looks that show pride in New York and in America,'' said Sharon Sternheim, owner of Zittles toy store on Madison Avenue and 76th Street. ''Last week, we sold out of military camouflage, the American flag and the Statue of Liberty within days.'' According to Ms. Sternheim, parents who prefer less violent or nationalistic looks for their offspring are opting for costumes of astronauts ($35), NASA pilots ($35) and American legends like Davy Crockett ($65). And while standards like Superman and Batman are having moderate success, Ms. Sternheim said, at the moment customers ''want real-life heroes, not make-believe ones.''",

The newspaper had interviewed U.S. Air Force General Ralph E. Eberhart, who had provided some cursory details of the military\u2019s rules of engagement for civilian aircraft. Before 11 September, the DOD had no formal rules concerning military engagement of a hijacked airplane when the flight had originated within the United States. However, on an unnamed date after 11 September, White House officials and the Joint Chiefs of Staff had approved new rules, stipulating that the U.S. military could down an aircraft that presented a security threat, but that the President of the United States or one of four specified U.S. Air Force generals must authorize such an action. The new rules also detailed measures taken by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the FAA for better joint surveillance of the nation\u2019s airspace. Those measures included NORAD\u2019s positioning of mobile ground radars around the country and a direct telephone line between the two agencies.(Eric Schmitt, \u201cGenerals Given Power To Order Downing of Jets,\u201d New York Times, 27 September 2001.)",

NASA had pledged to conduct an adequate number of Space Shuttle flights to complete the assembly of ISS by the end of the decade. Toward this end, NASA had reallocated funds budgeted for its scientific and exploration missions for fiscal years 2007−2011, transferring the projected funds to the budget for the Space Shuttle and the ISS. Griffin urged that NASA\u2019s second priority should be constructing the new CEV, which would transport humans to the ISS after NASA retired the Space Shuttles in 2010. Griffin said that the CEV must be operational \u201cnot later than 2014 and possibly much sooner.\u201d According to Griffin, NASA would have to delay several new scientific missions because fulfilling NASA\u2019s commitment to the ISS and the CEV was a higher priority.

NASA\u2019s Project Prometheus had been studying the HiPEP\u2015one of several candidate propulsion technologies\u2015for possible use on the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO). The JIMO Mission\u2019s design included a small nuclear reactor as its power source and electric thrusters to provide propulsion. NASA planned for JIMO to study Jupiter\u2019s three icy moons\u2015Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Director of Project Prometheus Alan R. Newhouse remarked that the test represented a \u201chuge leap in demonstrating the potential for advanced ion technologies.\u201d(NASA, \u201cNASA Successfully Tests Ion Engine,\u201d news release 03-377, 20 November 2003, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/nov/HQ_03377_ion_engine.html (accessed 5 February 2009).)",

        "story": "Researchers led by Mikki M. Osterloo of the University of Hawaii announced in the journal Science that their team had found evidence of salt deposits on the surface of Mars. The scientists explained that the existence of salt deposits would provide evidence that Mars had once had an abundant supply of near-surface water, which could have sustained life. NASA\u2019s Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System, a camera capable of producing images in visible light and infrared wavelengths, had made the discovery. The images showed spectral features consistent with chloride minerals, located at approximately 200 sites in the southern hemisphere. The salt deposits ranged in size from 0.5 square miles (1.3 square kilometers) to 25 times that size, with a thickness ranging from 3 to 10 feet (0.9 to 3 meters). Scientists believed that the mineral sites, which were approximately 3.5 to 3.9 billion years old, had formed when groundwater seeped to the surface and evaporated, leaving behind salty deposits.(NASA, \u201cNASA Mission Finds New Clues To Guide the Search for Life on Mars,\u201d news release 08-084, 20 March 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/mar/HQ_08084_Mars_Deposits.html (accessed 13 January 2011); David Mosher, \u201cNewly Found Martian Salt Deposits Suggest Ancient Life,\u201d Space.com, 20 March 2008, http://www.space.com/5150-newly-martian-salt-deposits-suggest-ancient-life.html (accessed 13 January 2011); M.

The two doctors injected chemical markers into the hind legs of six of the surviving baby rats to determine the role of gravity in the development of muscles. The crew anesthetized the baby rats before injecting them with the pink florescent chemical, the first time scientists had performed such a procedure in zero-gravity conditions. In addition to studying how muscles and nerves develop in space, the crew studied whether anesthesia really works without the help of gravity, whether patients have more difficulty recovering from anesthesia in space, and how wounds heal in space. Two other astronauts successfully completed \u201cthe most difficult medical procedure ever attempted on someone in space.\u201d The astronauts guided tiny needles into the nerves behind their knees, in an experiment aimed at understanding and easing the blood pressure problems and dizziness that astronauts suffer after returning to Earth. An estimated 500,000 Americans experience the same symptoms every day when they stand up. The needle enabled the astronauts to \u201clisten\u201d to electrical impulses, as the brain sent messages to the nerve.(Seth Borenstein, \u201cShuttle Surgeons Hope Rats Will Survive,\u201d Orlando Sentinel (FL), 29 April 1998; Steven Young for Reuters, \u201cU.S. Shuttle Crew Performs First Space Surgery,\u201d 29 April 1998; Marcia Dunn for Associated Press, \u201cSpace Shuttle,\u201d 30 April 1998; Robyn Suriano, \u201cAstronauts Listen to Brain-Nerve Chatter,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 30 April 1998.)",

Most of Columbia\u2019s 1-hour-long descent relied on two hydraulic units, because the cooling system for the third unit had failed. To prevent the third unit from overheating, the crew turned it on just minutes before landing. After the landing, Mission Control congratulated the Neurolab astronauts on \u201ca historic mission that elevated neuroscience research to record heights.\u201d During the 16-day Neurolab flight, the team had accomplished a number of experiments never before performed in space, including the first direct nerve recordings, the first joint recording of sleep and breathing, the first embalming of animals, and the first surgery on animals. Because only the rodents aboard Columbia were accessible during the flight, astronauts and scientists did not immediately know how the other animals, including fish, snails, and crickets, had fared. A quick inspection after landing, however, \u201crevealed that only 25 of 225 baby swordtail fish survived the mission, a much higher mortality rate than expected.\u201d The baby rats also had a higher mortality rate than expected; 52 of the 96 baby rats had died in orbit after their mothers refused to nurse them. NASA veterinarians had expected a dozen deaths from natural causes. Animal rights groups criticized the experiments.(USA Today, \u201cScientists To Study Effects on Critters,\u201d 4 May 1998; Paul Hoversten, \u201cMission\u2019s Data Has Scientists Feeling Antsy: Neurolab Analysis Begins Today,\u201d USA Today, 4 May 1998.)",

Subcommittee Ranking Member Mark Udall (D-CO) expressed concern that the proposed budget reductions to its aeronautics, microgravity life and physical sciences, and space and Earth sciences programs would further complicate NASA\u2019s efforts to create a workforce with an appropriate balance of civil servants and private contractors. NASA\u2019s Assistant Administrator for Human Capital Management Toni Dawsey testified that the overall objective of NASA\u2019s workforce strategy, submitted to Congress in April 2006, was \u201cto transform the composition of NASA\u2019s workforce so that it remained viable for the long-term goals of NASA\u2019s missions.\u201d She stated that NASA was addressing its two most pressing workforce challenges\u2014 \u201cuncovered capacity, caused by program changes and cancellations and budget constraints, and retaining Space Shuttle employees through its retirement in 2010.\u201d NASA was maintaining sufficient work in house to protect and strengthen its core capabilities and had established a Shuttle Human Capital Working Group to oversee the complex Shuttle workforce issues. David C. Black, co- chair of the NRC committee that NASA had asked to explore \u201clong-range science and technology workforce needs to achieve the Nation\u2019s long-term space exploration vision,\u201d also testified. In its interim report, the committee planned to recommend that NASA work with other government agencies involved in space-related work, as well as with the private sector, including universities, to \u201cassess the nature, scope, and possible solutions for its skill mix.\u201d(U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, The NASA th Workforce: Does NASA Have the Right Strategy and Policies To Retain and Build the Workforce It Will Need? 109 Cong., 2nd sess., 13 June 2006, 14, 17, 81, 84, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?browsePath= 109%2FHOUSE%2FCommittee+on+Science&granuleId=CHRG-109hhrg27971&packageId=CHRG- 109hhrg27971&fromBrowse=true (accessed 21 December 2010); U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Science, \u201cWhat Will NASA\u2019s Future Workforce Look Like?\u201d news release, 13 June 2006, http://science.house.gov/ press/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1140 (accessed 4 February 2010).)",

        "story": "At the American Astronomical Society convention, scientists Karl Gebhardt and Douglas O. Richstone announced that an extensive survey of more than 30 galaxies had revealed that black holes reach their large size through gradual growth. Previously, some research had suggested the opposite⎯that black holes were simply \u201cborn\u201d big. Using the HST, Gebhardt and Richstone had led a team of astronomers in determining the size of black holes in different galaxies. They found that, although small galaxies tend to have smaller black holes, the largest known galaxies have mammoth black holes. The astronomers suspected that the black holes had \u201cgrown up\u201d along with the galaxies where they resided, feeding on gas and stars to acquire increasing mass. Although further research must determine the precise correlation between black hole and galaxy size, the scientific community greeted news of the discovery with great interest. The HST had not only made the discovery possible but had provided the opportunity for scientists to continue \u201cblack hole hunting,\u201d to tabulate more exact answers.(NASA, \u201cBlack Holes Shed Light on Galaxy Formation,\u201d news release 00-88, 5 June 2000. 267)",

The team had studied x-rays emitted by enigmatic objects located in nearby galaxies, finding that the volume of x-rays emanating from these objects was comparable to or greater than the volume emitted by relatively warmer, larger hard x-ray sources, such as neutron stars and supermassive black holes.

Scientists already knew that the Milky Way produces a substantial quantity of gamma rays, which illuminate the galaxy. However, they were uncertain about whether the galaxy\u2019s gamma rays originate predominantly from so-called point sources, such as black holes and neutron stars, or from diffuse sources, such as gas atoms, which are abundant in the Milky Way. Using data from ESA\u2019s INTEGRALInternational Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratoryresearchers led by François Lebrun found that point sources account for nearly all of the gamma rays in the Milky Way, and diffuse sources play a distinctly minor role in gamma-ray production.(Henry Fountain, \u201cObservatory,\u201d New York Times, 23 March 2004; F.

The test, intended to assure engineers that all changes to the tank operated as expected, marked the first time since Columbia\u2019s accident that NASA had prepared an external tank for flight. The foam was necessary to keep the liquid fuel cool and to reduce ice build-up on the tank, but NASA and Lockheed Martin had redesigned the tank to reduce the amount of foam debris during launch. Changes to the tank design included removing the foam from the bipod ramp and replacing the foam with heaters. The designers had also added a \u201cdrip-lip\u201d to reduce ice accumulation on the joints that permit the adjustment of the tank\u2019s fuel line. In a dress rehearsal for Discovery\u2019s upcoming launch, engineers pumped more than 500,000 gallons of fuel into the tank, monitoring the tank and the Shuttle\u2019s systems down to the T-minus 31-second mark in a mock countdown.

A group of scientists had analyzed the XMM-Newton satellite\u2019s x-ray observations of the distant but exceptionally luminous quasar APM 08279+5255 and found that the quasar contains three times more iron than the Sun. Because exploding stars release iron, which increases across the universe over time, the scientists had expected APM 08279+5255 to have less iron than Earth\u2019s relatively older solar system. The scientists noted that the surprising quantity of iron in the distant quasar could be the result of an unknown phenomenon that produces iron very efficiently. However, they suggested that the more likely explanation for the finding was that the conventional method of measuring the age of celestial objects by estimating the objects\u2019 redshifta property of the light emitted by such objectswas flawed.(ESA, \u201cIs the Universe Older Than Expected?\u201d ESA news release, 10 July 2002; Günther Hasinger, Norbert Schartel, and Stefanie Komossa, \u201cDiscovery of an Ionized Fe K Edge in the z=3.91 Broad Absorption Line Quasar APM 08279+5255 with XMM-Newton,\u201d Astrophysical Journal Letters 573, no. 2 (10 July 2002): L77\u2013L80.)",

Farhad Zadeh of Northwestern University had used Chandra to locate \u201ca cauldron of 60 million degree gas enveloping a cluster of young stars.\u201d The discovery marked the first time that scientists had located such high-energy x-rays surrounding young stars. Zadeh also noted that the newly discovered cluster, located some 25,000 light-years from Earth and estimated at 1 to 2 million years old, had provided evidence in support of the theory that stellar winds generated by stars can produce very hot gas. In addition to Zadeh\u2019s find, Andreas Zezas of the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced that his team of scientists had found new midmass black holes in several starburst galaxiesregions where stars form and explode frequently. Researchers had long hypothesized that such an environment might exist but had previously been able to locate only a few midmass black holes. Zezas credited the powerful Chandra X-ray Observatory with allowing astronomers to examine far-flung galaxies more closely than before. Kimberly A. Weaver of NASA\u2019s GSFC, who had contributed to Zezas\u2019s project, hypothesized that the concentration of midsize black holes could possibly lead eventually to the formation of a single, massive black hole.(NASA, \u201cStar Factory near Galactic Center Bathed in High-Energy X-rays,\u201d news release 01-113, 6 June 2001; John Noble Wilford, \u201cHot Stellar Winds Captured by X-ray Orbiter,\u201d New York Times, 12 June 2001; NASA, \u201cChandra Sees Wealth of Black Holes in Star-Forming Galaxies,\u201d news release 01-110, 6 June 2001.)",

The government asserted that Lockheed improperly hid $7.1 million of interest-related debt in lease reimbursement claims it submitted to NASA, said Michael Shelby, United States attorney for the Southern District of Texas. A spokesman for Lockheed Martin said the company believed it did nothing wrong and admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement.",

In the days leading up to the close pass of Callisto, problems with Galileo\u2019s cameras had worried NASA controllers. Galileo scientists had anticipated the complications, however, predicting that the flyby, within 100 miles (161 kilometers) of the moon, would expose the probe to strong gravitational pulls and radiation belts. Galileo had originally begun orbiting Jupiter in 1995 and had already made 30 flybys of Jupiter\u2019s largest moons.",

The images revealed that the Martian moon Phobos is covered in a layer of dust at least 3 feet (0.9 meters) deep, the result of the impact of meteoroids, occurring over millions of years. Surveyor\u2019s thermal emission spectrometer revealed that, on Phobos, the temperature changes from -170oF to -25oF (-112oC to -32oC) between night and day. Scientists explained that dust accounts for some of the moon\u2019s drastic temperature change, because Phobos does not have an atmosphere enabling it to trap heat. Therefore, the surface\u2019s small particles have only 7 hours to absorb heat from the Sun, losing heat rapidly after sunset. Images of landslides on steep crater slopes indicated that Phobos\u2019s gravity, even at just 1/1,000th of that of Earth, is sufficient to pull objects downward.(NASA, \u201cMartian Moon Phobos Hip-Deep in Powder,\u201d news release 98-164, 11 September 1998; Jane E.

        "story": "The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a study conducted over two years, examining the United States\u2019 Earth-observing satellite missions. The study, Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond, was the first 10-year plan to recommend a path forward that would restore U.S. leadership in Earth science and prevent the collapse of the U.S. system of Earth- science satellites. The report recommended that, to accomplish this goal and to rebuild the aging network of environmental spacecraft, the U.S. government should fund 17 Earth-observing-satellite missions between 2010 and 2020. To fund these missions, NASA would need to resume spending US$2 billion per year on Earth science, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would need to maintain funding levels at US$1 billion each year. According to the report, NASA\u2019s budget for Earth science had decreased 30 percent since 2000, while NOAA had experienced major cost overruns and schedule delays in its primary mission to study weather and climate. Without reinvestment, the number of NASA\u2019s satellites monitoring the Earth\u2019s climate could decrease by 2017 from 25 to 7, leaving the United States without scientific information to analyze severe storms and to determine changes in the Earth\u2019s climate.(Brian Berger, \u201cReport Urges Reinvestment in U.S. Earth Science Satellites,\u201d Space.com, 16 January 2007, http://www.space.com/aol/businessmonday_070122.html (accessed 4 March 2010); Marc Kaufman, \u201cCutbacks Impede Climate Studies,\u201d Washington Post, 16 January 2007; National Research Council, Space Studies Board and Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2007), http://www.nap.edu/catalog. php?record_id=11820#toc (accessed 5 November 2009).)",

The upgrades to the HST significantly improved the range and precision of the instrument. Scientists reported peering approximately 50 million light-years away and zeroing in on previously undetectable black holes. According to Edward J. Weiler, the head of NASA\u2019s Hubble team, the added Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, installed in February 1997, reduced the length of time it took to confirm the presence of black holes in the universe. Weiler called the HST a \u201ccensus bureau\u201d for black-hole hunting, allowing researchers to survey these objects as a population rather than as individual phenomena. Another new instrument installed in February, the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), enabled the HST to capture near-infrared wavelengths, beginning to penetrate the \u201cdusty veil\u201d that had prevented astronomers from studying the birth and death of stars. NASA engineers also disclosed that an early focusing problem with one of the three cameras used by the NICMOS system seemed to be correcting itself. Although the flaw could limit the life of the system, scientists were confident that NICMOS would still be able to gather and preserve all scientific data. During early testing of the NICMOS system, scientists had uncovered a region of the universe in which young stars eject material into a molecular cloud, a process that researchers had long hypothesized but had been unable to observe.(NASA, \u201cHubble\u2019s Upgrades Show Birth and Death of Stars; Discover Massive Black Hole,\u201d news release 97-93, 12 May 1997; Kathy Sawyer, \u201cImproved Hubble Telescope Gets Rave Reviews at NASA,\u201d Washington Post, 13 May 1997; Reuters, \u201cHubble Captures Star Birth,\u201d 13 May 1997; Associated Press, \u201cUpgrade Hubble Telescope Dazzles Astronomers,\u201d 12 May 1997.)",

The team used the Hubble Space Telescope to capture the images of the supernovas, more than 17 million light-years from Earth. Astronomers had suspected that collisions occurred between exploding stars, but had been unable to capture an image of the process, because it was so short- lived. Although the scientific community would continue to debate the implications of the image, Blair offered this assessment of its significance: \u201cIt indicates that not only is there a lot of star formation going on, but a lot of those stars are massive. They are evolving quickly, and they are exploding as supernovas.\u201d",

Seven crew members were aboard the Space Shuttle, including American astronauts, Commander Mark E. Kelly, Pilot Kenneth T. Ham, Gregory E. Chamitoff, Michael E. Fossum, Ronald J. Garan Jr., and Karen L. Nyberg, and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide. During the mission, the astronauts planned to repair a broken toilet on the ISS and to install on the Japanese Kibo laboratory a new, 16-tonne (16,000-kilogram or 35,273-pound) room, known as the Japanese Pressurized Module (JPM). The astronauts planned three spacewalks. In addition to installing the JPM, they intended to clean a damaged power-supply rotary joint and to perform routine maintenance. NASA planned for the mission to last for 14 days. Garrett E. Reisman, who had been aboard the ISS since March 2008, would return to Earth with the STS-124 crew, and Chamitoff would remain aboard the ISS in his place.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 655; NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s Shuttle Discovery Launches with Japanese Laboratory,\u201d news release 08-136, 31 May 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_08136_STS-124_launch_release. html (accessed 16 March 2011); John Schwartz, \u201cShuttle Discovery Heads Toward the Space Station,\u201d New York Times, 1 June 2008.)",

Clutter affects all kinds of radars -- in fact, radar countermeasures used by warplanes involve the release of metallic chaff, which creates instant clutter and thus confusion on enemy radar screens. Bats, which use radarlike echolocation to navigate and catch prey, are affected by clutter as well, researchers in Switzerland and Britain say. Writing in the journal Nature, they describe how two species of mouse-eared bats are unable to locate dead (and therefore motionless) insects lying on backgrounds designed to simulate leaf litter or a fresh-cut meadow.",

        "story": "NASA researchers with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California at San Diego published research indicating that particles from human-produced pollution might significantly contribute to weakening the planet\u2019s hydrological cycle. The hydrological cycle is the circulation of water between Earth\u2019s atmosphere and its surface water and soils. Specifically, water precipitates from the atmosphere into surface water or soils and later evaporates from surface water, soils, and plants back into the atmosphere. The researchers had examined satellite data indicating aerosol distribution in the Indian Ocean region and had found that the aerosols, primarily composed of black carbon, could weaken the hydrological cycle in two ways. The aerosols could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the ocean, thereby decreasing the amount of water evaporating into the atmosphere. In addition, when particulates enter clouds, they reduce the size of cloud droplets, thereby reducing the amount of rain over polluted regions. The particulates in aerosols comprise a mixture of substances formed by the burning of fossil fuels and rural biomass. The new research was significant because it suggested that aerosols might be more environmentally harmful than scientists had previously understood and that air pollution is both an urban and a rural phenomenon.(NASA, \u201cTiny Pollution Particles May Carry Large Consequences for Earth\u2019s Water Supply,\u201d news release 01- 239, 6 December 2001; V.

In the days when the universe was under construction, Black God stood high atop a mountain carefully arranging the stars into the constellations we see today. But when he sat down to rest, the celestial architecture barely begun, Coyote stole his bag of star crystals, mischievously scattering them across the sky. The result was a tiny bit of order -- those connect-the-dot pictures of people and animals -- surrounded and overwhelmed by randomness. Astronomers now know that not even the constellations represent any meaningful order. The patterns that the Romans named Ursa Major and Cassiopeia (and the Navajos call Whirling Man and Whirling Woman) are just optical illusions peculiar to the galactic neighborhood in which we happen to reside. Viewed from another part of the heavens, Orion, Perseus and their cohorts would be stretched and squeezed beyond recognition.",

        "story": "Henry C. Ferguson, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, announced the discovery of stars residing outside of any defined galaxy. Scientists had long suspected that such stars existed, but Ferguson and his team were the first to confirm the theories. They did so using images captures by the HST, which revealed as many as 600 stars in the seemingly blank spaces among the Virgo cluster of galaxies, approximately 60 million light-years away from Earth. Ferguson suspected that many more stars⎯perhaps as many as 1 trillion Sun-like stars⎯are adrift in the galaxies of Virgo. The astronomers theorized that galactic mergers, or the tidal forces of nearby galaxies, had displaced the stars from their home galaxies.(John Noble Wilford, \u201cHubble Detects Stars that Belong to No Galaxy,\u201d New York Times, 15 January 1997.)",

Solovyev conducted a 6-hour spacewalk outside the Mir space station, to investigate further the damage caused by the June 1997 collision with a robotic supply craft. However, they were unable to find the puncture that space officials believed Mir had sustained. The exercise was only the second joint spacewalk of a U.S. astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut. During the excursion, Foale used a crane to hoist Solovyev toward the damaged region of the craft. The two crew members endured temperatures ranging from 200°F (93°C), when Mir was in the sunlight, to -150°F (-101°C), when it passed into the darkness. Although Foale had spent many hours preparing for the spacewalk, learning how to maneuver in the heavy Russian spacesuit, he still exercised extreme caution to avoid snagging the suit on of Mir\u2019s jagged edges. NASA had approved Foale\u2019s participation in the spacewalk only shortly before it occurred.(Michael R.

Russia had scheduled the resupply capsule to arrive at the ISS on 25 December 2004, but if it missed the delivery, crew members Leroy Chiao and Salizhan S. Sharipov would have to return to Earth aboard the Russian Soyuz capsule docked at the ISS. NASA also noted that, if the crew members had to evacuate the space station, Russia and the United States could continue to operate the ISS from Earth. Officials cited a number of reasons for the supply shortage on the ISS, including the postponement of regular supply missions after the Columbia accident and the necessary removal of some food supplies from an August 2004 resupply flight, to make room for equipment to monitor air quality in the ISS.(Mark Carreau, \u201cSpace Station Crew Endures Food Shortage,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 10 December 2004.)",

        "story": "NASA announced that it had canceled the X-33 rocket development project, an endeavor that many in the space industry had hoped would produce a vehicle to replace the Space Shuttle. NASA ended the five-year program after having invested nearly US$1 billion in developing a reusable launching vehicle. The X-33 program, contracted to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, had sought to build the world\u2019s most technologically advanced space vehicleshaped like an arrowhead and protected by a heat-resistant metallic covering. Because of its capability to ascend to space without having to drop weight by discarding boosters after launch, the new vehicle would have significantly improved on the Shuttle. NASA officials had hoped that the X- 33 would lead to development of the VentureStar vehicle, for transporting people and cargo into space. Operating at considerably less expense to NASA than the Space Shuttles, the VentureStar would permit more space missions per year. NASA\u2019s decision to cut funding for the X-33 was part of its general effort to reduce its budget. NASA officials in charge of the Space Launch Initiative (SLI) had determined that, although the X-33 program had yielded significant new knowledge, it had not advanced to a point at which NASA engineers could readily implement the new technology. Arthur G. Stephenson, the Director of NASA\u2019s MSFC, which had managed the program, called the decision to deny further funding \u201ca very tough decision.\u201d(NASA, \u201cNASA Reaches Milestone in Space Launch Initiative Program; Also Announces No SLI Funding for X- 33 or X-34,\u201d news release 01-31, 1 March 2001; Warren E.

O\u2019Keefe, who had received the U.S. Senate\u2019s confirmation on 20 December 2001, said he would spend the next few months learning about NASA. Explaining that he wanted both to refocus NASA and to keep it within its budget, O\u2019Keefe did not rule out the possibility of closing field centers and laying off employees to achieve his objectives. However, he stressed that he considered the budgetary problems of the ISS his immediate concern, and that he would first devote his attention to implementing the ISS Management and Cost Evaluation Task Force\u2019s (IMCE\u2019s) recommendation to scale back the ISS, at least temporarily, to reduce costs.(Warren E.

        "story": "Shuttle Atlantis lifted off from KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Mission STS-101 bound for the ISS. The seven-astronaut crew comprised Americans⎯James D. Halsell Jr., Scott J. Horowitz, Susan J. Helms, James S. Voss, Mary Ellen Weber, and Jeffrey N. Williams⎯and Russian cosmonaut Yury V. Usachev. The crew planned to make repairs to the space station, focusing primarily on replacing four malfunctioning solar-powered batteries. The crew also planned to use the thrusters of the Shuttle to realign the ISS\u2019s orbit. Having been unoccupied and underpowered for nearly a year, the station had fallen below the optimal orbiting altitude. The station had gradually descended at a rate of about 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) per week. The Shuttle mission plan also called for Atlantis\u2019s crew to repair a damaged radio antenna and stabilize a shaky construction crane mounted on the outside of the ISS. Because of volatile weather in April 2000 and a full docket of rocket launches, NASA had delayed Atlantis\u2019s launch three times, pushing the Shuttle\u2019s liftoff into mid-May. Russian cosmonaut Yury V. Usachev, a veteran of two tenures aboard Mir, had spent more time in space than the rest of Atlantis\u2019s crew combined.(Tom Breen, \u201cNASA Goes for 4th Launch Try in a Month,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 19 May 2000; Reuters, \u201cUSA: Update 1⎯Shuttle Atlantis Lifts Off from Florida,\u201d 19 May 2000; Associated Press, \u201cAtlantis Lifts Off on Fourth Try,\u201d 18 May 2000; Associated Press, \u201cSix Americans, One Russian Bound for Space Station,\u201d 19 May 2000.)",

By firing its steering jets 27 times during a 1-hour push, Shuttle Atlantis raised the space station about 9 miles (14 kilometers) farther from Earth than it had been. The effort was the first of three planned realignment maneuvers. NASA officials wanted to allow Atlantis\u2019s thrusters to have a day to cool down before continuing with the project. In addition to changing the ISS\u2019s orbit, Atlantis\u2019s astronauts serviced the exterior of the space station and replaced four of its failing batteries. The crew hoped that the latter procedure would stop the gradual drop in elevation that the ISS had been experiencing during the months before Atlantis\u2019s visit.(Los Angeles Times, \u201cShuttle Gives Space Station a Boost,\u201d 24 May 2000; Associated Press, \u201cAtlantis Lifts Space Station to Right Orbit,\u201d 24 May 2000; Associated Press, \u201cSpace Station Gets Fresh Batteries,\u201d 24 May 2000.)",

NASA officials had decided to extend the mission an extra day to allow the crew more time to accomplish its work inside the space station. N. Wayne Hale, STS-106 Flight Director, explained that the mission had begun with 52 items on its list of tasks to accomplish, but the number had increased to 74 different tasks, large and small, on board the ISS. The only malfunction during the mission had been that of a newly installed battery, which Russian Mission Control had ordered disconnected when it failed to charge properly.(Dow Jones Newswire, \u201cSpace Shuttle Atlantis Touches Down Successfully,\u201d 20 September 2000.)",

        "story": "NASA commemorated the 25th anniversary of the still-orbiting Pioneer 10 space probe. Launched 2 March 1972, Pioneer 10 was the functioning probe farthest from Earth, at approximately 6 billion miles (9.6 billion kilometers) away. NASA originally had intended the probe to orbit for 21 months, but the spacecraft had continued to perform remarkably well and efficiently long after its designated mission. The probe completed its planned objective of surveying Jupiter in 1972; after that, NASA launched Pioneer 10 into space at 86,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) per hour. Since then, scientists had tracked the probe, learning more about magnetic fields, solar wind, cosmic particles, and ultraviolet glow. In June 1983, Pioneer 10 became the first human-made object to leave the solar system. On the day marking Pioneer 10\u2019s 25th year in space, the probe still broadcast \u201ccrystal-clear data\u201d to the NASA control room on Earth. NASA did not plan a 26th anniversary for the probe, explaining that Pioneer 10\u2019s pulse was finally growing so weak that it could no longer facilitate significant scientific experiments.(Associated Press, \u201cPioneer 10,\u201d 3 March 1997; USA Today, \u201cNASA To Retire Oldest Interplanetary Explorer,\u201d 3 March 1997.)",

The launch, which took place in Russia, ended government domination of space spying. According to EarthWatch, Early Bird 1 had the capability to track objects on Earth as small as 10-feet (3-meters) long. The company also reported that \u201ccustomers were lining up to buy images.\u201d Customers for Early Bird 1 services included public interest groups, planning to track military movement and arms control measures, and foreign governments, without the resources to launch their own satellites. Because Early Bird 1 was an American-produced satellite, the U.S. federal government retained the right to switch it off during wartime, as well as the right to filter images sold to foreign customers. Experts predicted that the security and privacy questions surrounding the first private spy satellite would take years to sort out. However, they also surmised that Early Bird 1 was only the first in the wave of satellites that private industry would launch during the coming decade.(William J.

Moore, Head of the Art and Archaeology Department of the School of Oriental and African Studies, the University of London, and Anthony Freeman, a radar scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), discussed new radar imagery of Angkor, Cambodia, during a press briefing at JPL. The researchers announced that the Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR), developed by JPL to produce radar maps, had helped them to detect and locate a distribution of prehistoric mounds and undocumented temples to the northwest of Angkor. The three-dimensional maps, created using radar interferometry, revealed evidence of temples and earlier civilization that were absent or incorrectly marked on modern topographic maps and early twentieth-century archaeological reports. These discoveries brought into question long-standing ideas about the urban evolution of Angkor. The 1996 AIRSAR Pacific Rim Deployment on board a NASA DC-8 jet was a follow-up to a 1994 study of Angkor that used Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) on board Space Shuttle Endeavour during Mission STS-59, producing the radar images used to create the three- dimensional maps. Unlike SIR-C/X-SAR, AIRSAR had P-band with a longer wavelength, able to penetrate the forest canopy. AIRSAR also flew in a mode that allowed it to measure topography and create three-dimensional images of the surface.(NASA, \u201cNew Insights into Ancient Angkor by NASA Radar To Be Subject of Press Briefing,\u201d news release N98-11, 5 February 1998; NASA, \u201cNASA Radar Reveals Hidden Remains at Ancient Angkor,\u201d news release 98-28, 12 February 1998; Jane E.

        "story": "The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy formally approved the mid-October launch plan of the controversial plutonium-powered Cassini Mission. Critics had subjected to intense scrutiny the exploratory mission to Saturn and its moon Titan, because it used nuclear power. The Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, among other organizations, had protested the mission and attempted to derail it, but had failed to spark widespread public outrage. Activists worried that the rocket might release plutonium if the launch failed, despite NASA\u2019s more than a dozen safe launches using the hazardous fuel. The mission required nuclear power because Saturn has extremely dim sunlight⎯not enough to provide adequate solar power to prevent the Cassini spacecraft\u2019s instruments from freezing. NASA\u2019s policy required that the White House give final approval of the launch, because the mission used nuclear fuel. NASA had begun work on the Cassini Mission in 1989, with cooperation from the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. Many regarded the mission⎯the first time a space probe had attempted to land on the moon of another planet⎯as NASA\u2019s boldest and most ambitious endeavor. This aspect of the mission especially interested scientists, who theorized that Titan has an Earth-like atmosphere. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said of the mission: \u201cI fully expect that it will return spectacular images and scientific data about Saturn.\u201d(NASA, \u201cCassini To Survey Worlds of Saturn and Titan; Sends First Probe to Moon of Another Planet,\u201d news release 97-190, 3 September 1997; NASA, \u201cNASA Receives Approval To Launch Cassini Mission,\u201d news release 97-225, 3 October 1997; Maurice Tamman, \u201cProtestors Set Stage,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 29 September 1997.)",

Readdy called \u201can evolving document,\u201d indicated that 11 March 2004 was the earliest possible date for a Space Shuttle to return to flight. However, Readdy emphasized that NASA would be safety-driven, not schedule-driven, in its efforts to launch the first Shuttle to fly since the Columbia disaster. NASA had tentatively scheduled Atlantis for a launch between 11 March and 6 April 2004. In the preliminary plan, NASA indicated that it had changed Atlantis\u2019s original mission of ferrying supplies and a new crew to the ISS. Instead, the mission would be a developmental flight during which the crew would test the new procedures and safety equipment that the CAIB had recommended. Although the ISS would still be Atlantis\u2019s destination, the mission would not carry ISS replacement crew. NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle Program Manager William W. Parsons Jr. said that the greatest challenges for future Shuttle missions would be developing methods to minimize the shedding of foam from the orbiter\u2019s external tank and to repair tile and protective heat panels while in space. In addition, NASA would have to install cameras and sensors on the Shuttles and on the ISS robotic arms, to detect vehicle damage.(John Schwartz and Warren E.

The X-33/Venturestar single stage\u2013to\u2013orbit rocket plane, which NASA and Lockheed Martin had shelved, had been a prototype for aerospike-motor technology. Students at California State University at Long Beach had designed and developed the research vehicle Prospector 2 to use a mixture of liquid oxygen and ethanol. The rocket pitched after several seconds of stable flight, crashing to the floor of the Mojave Desert in California and destroying student payloads on impact. However, the aft section of the vehicle, which contained the aerospike, remained mostly intact. The mission achieved its single objective: to lift the vehicle into the air using the liquid-propellant aerospike engine. The test revealed several areas of the aerospike-engine design that needed improvement.(Space News, \u201cRocketeers Fly Aerospike Engine,\u201d 24 September 2003.)",

Using the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics, an x-ray satellite belonging to Japan and the United States and launched in 1993, the team observed superheated gas in the accretion disc of the black hole. Previously, scientists had only \u201cseen\u201d the phenomenon by observing these accretion discs, or \u201cthe swirling matter circling around as it is being pulled into the black hole.\u201d However, this time, the Goddard team had observed a \u201cstrange feature\u201d buried in the x-rays that the gas emitted. Energy had been redshifted, an occurrence described as an \u201castronomical Doppler effect,\u201d because, just as the compression of sound waves, for example, causes the sound of a siren to rise and fall as it passes an observer, light stretches as it speeds away from Earth. The team observed light that was being stretched⎯redshifted⎯moving at about 6.5 million miles (10.5 million kilometers) per hour, toward a black hole in galaxy NGC 3516.(Reuters, \u201cEvidence of Super Gravity Reported: Backs Black Hole Astronomy Theory,\u201d Washington Times, 17 August 1999.)",

Schirra was the only astronaut to participate in all three of the United States\u2019 first human space projects\u2014Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. Selected in 1959 as one of the first seven astronauts, Schirra had made his first spaceflight on 3 October 1962, piloting the fifth Mercury mission, in which Mercury orbited Earth six times in 9 hours and 13 minutes. On 15 December 1965, Schirra had flown aboard Gemini 6-A with Thomas P. Stafford II, in a mission that included the first rendezvous of maneuverable spacecraft. Gemini 6-A, carrying Schirra and Stafford, had flown in formation for 5 hours with Gemini 7, which carried astronauts Frank F. Borman II and James A. Lovell Jr. With his fellow Apollo 7 crew members Walter Cunningham and Donn F. Eisele, Schirra had tested the Apollo\u2019s systems during an 11-day flight beginning on 11 October 1968, a test that proved that Apollo was ready to ferry astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo 7 flight, Schirra\u2019s final mission for NASA, had been the first to provide televised images from orbit. Following his retirement from the U.S. Navy in 1969, Schirra had worked with Walter L. Cronkite Jr. as a news commentator for CBS. Schirra was also a founding member and director of the Mercury Seven Foundation. The U.S. military had awarded Schirra the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, three Distinguished Flying Crosses, three Air Medals, and the Philippines Legion of Honor. NASA had awarded him two Distinguished Service Medals and its Exceptional Service Medal.(NASA, \u201cVeteran Astronaut Walter Schirra Dies,\u201d news release 07-100, 3 May 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/ hqnews/2007/may/HQ_07100_Schirra_Dies.html (accessed 24 March 2010); Richard Goldstein, \u201cWalter M.

Budarin, Bowersox, and Pettit had arrived at the ISS in November 2002 aboard Endeavour, scheduled to return to Earth aboard another Shuttle flight on 11 March. However, the Columbia disaster in February had grounded the remaining three Shuttles in NASA\u2019s fleet, prolonging the crew\u2019s stay aboard the ISS. Russian search teams took 2 hours, using a helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft, to find the crew. The last radio contact between the capsule and Mission Control Center in Moscow had occurred after the craft\u2019s parachutes opened, about 15 minutes before landing. Failure to reestablish contact had caused concern for the trio\u2019s welfare. Russian Space Agency spokesperson Sergei Gorbunov announced that a special commission would investigate the causes of the malfunctions during landing.(Mark Carreau, \u201cAnxiety as Astronauts Miss Target for Landing,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 5 May 2003; Sharon LaFraniere, \u201cSpace Station Crew Returns Home in Russian Soyuz,\u201d Washington Post, 5 May 2003.)",

        "story": "Mario Dario Grossi, radio physicist and engineer, died at the age of 74 in Boston, Massachusetts. Grossi developed the concept of tethered satellites and the hardware to make them possible. Together with a colleague, Grossi had conducted most of his work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Grossi had first approached NASA with his concept in 1972, and in 1982 NASA had issued a contract to build a system. In July 1992, NASA had tested the tether in space when astronauts aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis Mission STS-46 \u201creeled out a half-ton [450- kilogram or 0.45-tonne] satellite of the Italian Space Agency dangling on a spaghetti-thin cord 12 miles [19 kilometers] long.\u201d The successful test had provided data that would assist engineers in applying the tether satellite technology to build space stations or in \u201coperating instrument- laden satellites far from the [S]huttle.\u201d(Wolfgang Saxon, \u201cM.

On 27 September 2008, Zhai had performed China\u2019s first spacewalk, leaving the spacecraft for 20 minutes to collect a test sample of solid lubricant that engineers had attached to the outside of the craft. The spacewalk also tested Zhai\u2019s US$4.4 million Chinese-made spacesuit. After the spacewalk, the astronauts had released an 88-pound (39.92-kilogram) satellite, which would take photographs and transmit them back to Earth. The mission marked China as the third nation, along with the United States and Russia, capable of independently launching crewed spaceflights and conducting spacewalks.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 659, 1 October 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx659.html (accessed 25 July 2011); Clara Moskowitz, \u201cChina\u2019s Third Manned Spaceflight Returns Safely to Earth,\u201d Space.com, 28 September 2008, http://www.space.com/5904-china-manned-spaceflight-returns-safely-earth.html (accessed 27 July 2011); Chistopher Bodeen, \u201cChinese Cheer as Astronauts Makes [sic] First Spacewalk,\u201d Associated Press, 28 September 2008.)",

        "story": "In the first spaceflight of 1997, Shuttle Atlantis launched for a linkup mission with the Mir space station. Mission STS-81 was the fifth Shuttle voyage to bring supplies and new crew members to the Russian space station. Atlantis carried the SPACEHAB module in the payload bay of its orbiter, with experiments for Atlantis\u2019s crew, as well as equipment for Mir. Michael A. Baker, making his fourth Shuttle flight, commanded the mission, with Brent W. Jett Jr. serving as Pilot. Astronaut Jerry M. Linenger was also aboard, set to replace astronaut John E. Blaha as the representative of the United States aboard Mir. Blaha had spent nearly four months aboard the orbiting station, roughly the same tenure planned for Linenger. So that Atlantis could rendezvous with Mir, the Shuttle had launched at precisely 4:27 a.m. (EST). Atlantis would spend two days orbiting, periodically firing its engines to draw closer to Mir, approximately 240 miles (386 kilometers) above Earth. The United States and Russia planned for the Shuttle\u2013Mir missions to contribute to the international team\u2019s development of procedures and techniques for use on the International Space Station (ISS). NASA and the Russian Space Agency referred to the missions as Phase I of the ISS effort.(NASA, \u201cFifth Shuttle\u2013Mir Docking Flight Highlights STS-81 Mission,\u201d news release 97-2, January 1996; William Harwood, \u201cAtlantis Roars into Orbit, Begins Chasing Mir for Tuesday Linkup,\u201d Washington Post, 13 January 1997; Associated Press, \u201cAtlantis en Route to Russian Station After \u2018Gorgeous Launch\u2019,\u201d 12 January 1997.)",

        "story": "NASA announced that planned major modifications of Space Shuttle Atlantis, as well as routine inspections, would take place at the Boeing Company\u2019s facility in Palmdale, California, rather than at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida. United Space Alliance, the company contracted for the maintenance and operation of the Shuttle program, had recommended the changes. According to estimates of the U.S. General Accounting Office, completing the renovations in California, rather than in Florida, would cost NASA an additional US$20 million because of higher labor costs. NASA explained that if the engineers had done the work in Florida, the launch schedule at KSC, along with the need for Atlantis to make a prolonged stay for extensive modifications, would have threatened future Shuttle flights. The changes planned, including rerouting the Shuttle\u2019s fuel lines, involved more than routine maintenance. NASA also pointed out that its most experienced engineers worked at the Palmdale facility, and that workers at the facility had already made similar modifications to Shuttles Discovery and Endeavour. Moreover, NASA maintained that permitting KSC to focus on Shuttle launches and missions would be the most efficient use of its resources. Nevertheless, immediately after the announcement, some observers criticized NASA\u2019s continued use of Boeing\u2019s private facility in preference to that of the government-owned KSC. NASA\u2019s previous intimation that the Palmdale facility would be \u201cmothballed\u201d for Shuttle repair and maintenance intensified critics\u2019 reaction to the announcement.(Seth Borenstein, \u201cDespite Boost in Cost, Atlantis To Get Tuneup in California,\u201d Orlando Sentinel (FL), 17 January 1997; NASA, \u201cSpace Shuttle Atlantis Modification Work To Be Performed at Palmdale Facility,\u201d news release 97-11, 16 January 1997; Todd Halvorson, \u201cAtlantis Overhaul To Be Done Out West,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 17 January 1997.)",

Blaha, just returning from a four-month stay aboard the Mir space station, reported that he had experienced feelings of depression and anxiety during his long deployment in space. Blaha indicated that the conditions aboard Mir, rather than any elements of the space environment, had caused his difficulty. According to Blaha, the lack of private quarters for U.S. astronauts, who unlike the Russian cosmonauts did not have even small personal quarters, was one of the most difficult aspects of his stay aboard Mir. He also reported that, although relations with his Russian counterparts always had remained respectful, the tension of getting to know men who spoke a different language in such tight quarters created \u201canother element of psychological pressure and stress,\u201d aside from the inevitable feelings of isolation. Blaha reported that he had experienced psychological depression, especially during his first month aboard the Russian space station. He made these remarks aboard Shuttle Atlantis as it returned him to Earth, in the course of radio communications with four people living inside an airtight chamber at JSC in Houston, who were taking part in a 60-day experiment for future ISS deployments.(Associated Press, \u201cAstronaut Tells of Down Side to Space Life,\u201d New York Times, 22 January 1997.)",

NASA had delayed a Shuttle launch because of a new requirement that launches occur during daylight hours, to enable photographing the liftoff from multiple angles. Because of the limited number of days available in which a launch could take place in daylight, the next Shuttle launch could occur no earlier than March 2005. In addition, NASA announced that, when Shuttle launches recommenced, one Shuttle would function as a standby rescue vehicle in case the Shuttle carrying the crew sustained damage during flight. NASA announced that, although rescue vehicles would not necessarily be positioned on the launchpad, they would be ready for launch within 45 to 90 days, the maximum length of time that seven astronauts could survive on the ISS before their supplies ran out.(NASA, \u201cNASA Updates Space Shuttle Return to Flight Plans,\u201d news release n04-065, 19 February 2004; Warren E.

Through no great fault of his own, Mr. O'Keefe is leaving the space program in worse shape than he found it. The remaining shuttles are still grounded for safety repairs, the space station they service is a shrunken shell and the agency has been given a challenging long-term mandate for space exploration with little new money to carry it out. Mr. O'Keefe announced recently that he would soon depart for a high-paying job as chancellor of Louisiana State University. He will bequeath to his successor a daunting array of half-finished tasks as the American space program struggles to get back on course. The irony is that Mr. O'Keefe's impact has been virtually the opposite of what was initially expected. A self-described ''bean counter'' who had been deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, he was appointed to NASA in December 2001 to bring its finances under control after the International Space Station program was staggered by a projected overrun of almost $5 billion. The chief worry voiced by space enthusiasts was that he would bring an accountant's mentality to an agency that needed bold vision. As it turned out, he is leaving the agency's finances still mired in confusion but played a role, yet to be spelled out, in shaping the exploration vision put forth by the White House.",

        "story": "The National Research Council (NRC) issued a report outlining recommendations for servicing the HST. The issue of servicing the HST had initiated a public discussion in January 2004, when NASA had decided to cancel a Shuttle mission to service the HST because of concern for astronaut safety. The debate had erupted again after April 2004, when NASA had announced that it would conduct an unpiloted servicing mission for the HST. In response to criticism for those decisions, NASA had requested that the NRC evaluate servicing options for the HST. The NRC recommended that NASA service the HST using a piloted Shuttle mission, because a robotic mission would be too complex for NASA to complete before 2007, when NASA anticipated that the HST\u2019s machinery would wear out. According to the guidelines recommended by the CAIB, astronauts would be able to service the HST by 2007. The NRC also reported that, if NASA carefully planned and conducted the piloted Shuttle mission, the mission would be far more likely to extend the telescope\u2019s operational life at a relatively lower cost.(Guy Gugliotta, \u201cAstronauts Acceptable, Panel Says,\u201d Washington Post, 9 December 2004; National Research Council, Assessment of Options for Extending the Life of the Hubble Space Telescope: Final Report (Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 2005).)",

But imagine a world in which distant objects appear younger than nearby objects, and younger not only on the narrow time scale of years or generations, but on an evolutionary time scale. In a world like that you would confront the paradox of looking at a horse on the distant horizon and seeing not a modern horse but its distant ancestor, running rapidly, as it happens, away from you. The same horse, if it chose in its solipsistic modernity to look your way, would see only the rapidly receding ancestral human in you. This would be a hard world in which to measure time or distance. Yet that is the universe. Distant galaxies appear younger and less evolved than nearer galaxies because we look at them not only across distance, but also across time. Distant galaxies also appear to be moving more rapidly away from us than nearer ones because, in essence, they still preserve the momentum with which the earlier universe -- as young as the light from those remote galaxies -- was expanding. Looking out into space, we look into the past, and yet the farther we look, the younger the objects we see. ''Here and now,'' so to speak, is the oldest, or rather least young, place in the universe.",

Freedman\u2019s team had concluded that the universe was between 12 billion and 13.4 billion years old, at least 1 billion years younger than predicted. Freedman\u2019s international team had studied eight years of calculations, made observations using NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and used a range of celestial measurements to recalculate the age of the universe. Among those measurements was the \u201cHubble constant,\u201d used in mathematical equations to \u201cgauge the speed at which galaxies are accelerating away from each other.\u201d Named for Edwin Hubble, who had discovered 70 years ago that the universe is expanding, the Hubble constant is an essential piece of the equation determining the age and size of the universe. The team\u2019s findings drew criticism from other astronomers. Although the Australian physicist Charles H. Lineweaver had conducted separate research with the same result as that of Freedman\u2019s team, some astronomers associated with the Carnegie Observatories and Harvard University did not agree with the Freedman team\u2019s conclusions. Allan Sandage of the Carnegie Observatories stated that he believed that the team\u2019s methodology contained systematic errors and that the final number was not correct. Harvard University astronomer Robert P. Kirshner had led a third team, using the Hubble constant to study the age of the universe, but although he calculated a different age than the other teams, Kirshner downplayed the differences in their results, remarking that \u201cwhat was once a very big disagreement is now narrowing down.\u201d(NASA Johnson Space Center, \u201cHubble Completes Eight-Year Effort To Measure Expanding Universe,\u201d news release H99-65, 25 May 1999, http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/releases/1999/H99-65.html (accessed 2 January 2008); Robert Lee Hotz, \u201cScientists Calculate Most Precise Age Yet for Universe; Astronomy: New Data, Hubble Telescope Help Two Separate Teams Put Range at 12 Billion to 13.4 Billion Years,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 26 May 1999.)",

Russian engineers expected that the Soyuz mission scheduled for 23 October 2008 would return the bolt to Earth. The engineers hoped to study the bolt, to determine why similar bolts had failed or misfired during the Soyuz reentries of 21 October 2007 and 19 April 2008. Because of those malfunctions, the spacecraft had entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere at steeper-than-normal angles, subjecting the crews to higher gravitational forces and causing the vehicles to land as far as 300 miles (482.80 kilometers) off course.(Mark Carreau, \u201cCosmonauts Remove Explosive Bolt on Daring Spacewalk,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 11 July 2008.)",

The finding provided important information about the formation of galaxies and the composition of stars. Rychard J. Bouwens and Garth D. Illingworth of the University of California, Santa Cruz, had used data from NASA\u2019s HST to determine that, beginning 700 million years after the Big Bang, the number of galaxies had increased tenfold in 200 million years. Another team of researchers, led by Masanori Iye of the National Astronomical Observatory in Tokyo, had found a similar increase in galaxy formation during the same period. These findings supported a prevailing theory of galaxy formation, which held that luminous galaxies were rare in the universe\u2019s earliest times. As heavy elements, such as carbon, iron, and oxygen emerged, these new elements had formed the building blocks for stars and galaxies. The team cautioned that astronomers would need to make further observations to determine more certainly how galaxies had formed during the universe\u2019s nascent years.(Dennis Overbye, \u201cThe Boom in Galaxies After the Big Bang,\u201d New York Times, 14 September 2006; Rychard J.

The Task Force\u2019s report stated that, although the ISS program\u2019s technical achievements to date had been extraordinary, problems concerning the program\u2019s budget, management, and other matters threatened future development of the ISS. In addition, the IMCE Task Force recommended numerous changes to establish a core-complete program for the ISS, including altering program management; identifying and applying additional funding; and implementing more clearly defined programs to build the ISS so that its crew would be able to conduct high-priority research at the space station. With regard to maximizing research under the proposed FY 2002 budget, the Task Force recommended establishing research priorities, implementing a plan to execute them, and allocating more ISS crew time to high-priority research.(NASA, \u201cReport by the International Space Station Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task Force to the NASA Advisory Council\u201d (report, Washington, DC, 1 November 2001), http://history.nasa.gov/youngrep.pdf (accessed 26 November 2008).)",

After working to install hardware and equipment, the pair had to remain outside the ISS until NASA flight controllers had determined that the Italian module filled with supplies had found an ISS docking port. Voss and Helms spent 8 hours and 56 minutes on their spacewalk, eclipsing the record of 8 hours and 29 minutes set in 1992. The U.S astronauts conducted complex work, involving a series of slow, deliberate maneuvers. NASA\u2019s flight director commented that the lengthy endeavor required stamina, remarking that the spacewalk pushed the two astronauts \u201cright to the edge\u201d of what they could handle. Early in the spacewalk, Voss and Helms each mishandled pieces of equipment, causing one device to float off into space and slowing the process by about 1 hour.(Marcia Dunn for Associated Press, \u201cA Record Job, with Some Butterfingers,\u201d 13 March 2001; CNN.com, \u201cAstronauts Set Out-of-This-World Record,\u201d http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/03/11/ space.shuttle.02/ (accessed 18 July 2008); Associated Press, \u201c2 Astronauts Walk in Space Almost 9 Hours,\u201d 12 March 2001; Agence France-Presse, \u201cDiscovery Astronauts End Marathon Spacewalk To Add Leonardo to ISS Canvas,\u201d 12 March 2001. 32 NASA, \u201cDeepest X-rays Ever Reveal Universe Teeming with Black Holes,\u201d news release 01-37, 13 March 2001; Kathy Sawyer, \u201cYoung Cosmos Was Full of Black Holes,\u201d Washington Post, 14 March 2001; Associated Press, \u201cX- ray Telescope Finds Heavens Brimming with Black Holes,\u201d 14 March 2001.)",

Engineers used a compressed nitrogen gas cannon to fire a 1.7-pound (0.77-kilogram) piece of foam at the wing mockup at a speed of 530 miles per hour (853 kilometers per hour), duplicating the force exerted on Columbia\u2019s wing when a piece of foam of the same size hit the orbiter during launch. The test results showed that it was possible that a foam block falling from the external tank could have breached the orbiter\u2019s leading edge, allowing hot gases to penetrate the wing structure during reentry and resulting in the breakup of Columbia.(Alan Levin, \u201cShuttle Foam Test Leaves Hole,\u201d USA Today, 8 July 2003; John Kelly, \u201cFoam Punches Large Hole in Wing: Test is \u2018Smoking Gun\u2019, Shuttle Panel Says,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 8 July 2003.)",

Scientists hoped that studying Hale-Bopp would lead to a greater general understanding of comets. Because comets are composed of loosely packed dirt and ice, experts consider them the best-preserved remnants of the early solar system. NASA disclosed that the Wallops Flight Facility would launch four rockets using ultraviolet wavelengths, to study Comet Hale-Bopp. In addition, the Ulysses spacecraft, the joint project of NASA and the ESA, which was already in orbit at the time, would chart the effects of solar-wind conditions on comets. However, scientists also disclosed that the close proximity of Hale-Bopp to the Sun posed a danger to HST\u2019s sensitive detectors; therefore, they had determined to wait until a few months after the comet\u2019s approach to Earth before tracking it with the telescope. JPL planned to host a public event, called Comet Chasers: On the Trail of a Comet, to bring scholars and the public together to discuss the significance of Comet Hale- Bopp.(NASA, \u201cNASA Plans Comet Hale-Bopp Observing Campaign, Activities,\u201d news release N97-17, 13 March 1996.)",

The crew used the space station\u2019s massive, Canadian-made robotic arm, which had not operated properly for several months, to hoist the enormous entryway out of the Shuttle\u2019s cargo bay and to move it into position for installation. Astronaut Susan J. Helms commanded the robotic arm, while spacewalking astronauts Michael L. Gernhardt and James F. Reilly helped line up the hatch for its final installation. The robotic arm successfully accomplished its first construction task, drawing applause from NASA\u2019s Mission Control, as did the opening of the US$164 million Joint Airlock. Although the ISS Partnership planned improvements and additions to the space station far into the future, the mission marked the end of a major stage of assembly for the ISS.(New York Times, \u201c2nd Entry Installed on Space Station,\u201d 16 July 2001.)",

Chase, Executive Director of the National Space Society and a former congressional aide, testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space concerning problems in NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle Program. Roland stated that the Shuttle was not sustainable as a safe, reliable, and economical launch vehicle and recommended its phaseout. Roland faulted NASA for ignoring the findings of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident (Rogers Commission), which had paved the way for the Shuttle to return to flight after the Challenger disaster in 1986. The Rogers Commission had recommended that NASA begin developing a next-generation launch vehicle immediately. However, 16 years later, NASA continued to rely on the Space Shuttle and had no replacement in sight. Chase recommended the short-term maintenance of the remaining Shuttles and endorsed the George W. Bush administration\u2019s plan to develop an Orbital Space Plane (OSP) ready to transport crews to the ISS by 2010. He also recommended that NASA use commercial heavy-lift launch vehicles for hauling cargo to the space station.(Jefferson Morris, \u201cFormer NASA Historian Urges Phaseout of Shuttle,\u201d Aerospace Daily, 4 April 2003; Larry Wheeler, \u201cExperts Disagree on Future of Shuttle,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 3 April 2003.)",

After the two craft had flown apart for 1 hour, ASTRO directed on-board guidance and navigation instruments to close in and to dock with NextSat, completing the mission\u2019s objectives without input from ground controllers.

Tani and Parazynski made progress outfitting the new Harmony module, mating the power and data grapple fixture, and reconfiguring connectors on the S1 truss, in preparation for the later deployment of the radiator on S1. Tani also inspected the SARJ, collecting fine metal shavings on part of a wheel with solar panels attached to it. The discovery of the metal shavings enabled engineers to identify the source of friction that had caused the wheel to begin slowing down in September. Engineers had designed the wheel to spin freely so that the solar panels pointed toward the Sun; the panels generated electricity to operate the ISS\u2019s computers, oxygen- producing machine, and other systems. Tani reported that, in addition to collecting the metal shavings, he had observed that parts of the wheel\u2019s surface appeared discolored, a possible sign of corrosion. To prevent further damage to the wheel, engineers stopped it from spinning, thereby reducing the amount of electricity that the panels generated. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 33 minutes.(NASA, \u201cNASAfacts; STS-120\u201d; Traci Watson, \u201cDamaged Component Could Thwart Space Station Plans,\u201d USA Today, 29 October 2007; John Schwartz, \u201cAstronauts Discover Damage to Space Station,\u201d 29 October 2007.)",

        "story": "NASA controllers began sending signals to the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory to perform a series of maneuvers that would ultimately end in the satellite crashing into the Pacific Ocean. The endgame commands marked the conclusion of a successful nine-year mission, which had recorded data on more than 2,500 gamma-ray bursts. The US$670 million satellite, launched on 5 April 1991 aboard Mission STS-37, had provided researchers with never-before-seen images of explosions throughout the universe. \u201cIt will be like losing a member of the family,\u201d remarked one NASA scientist who had worked on the program since 1979. NASA officials had decided to end the satellite\u2019s space tenure because of the possibility that the aging satellite might become unresponsive and plummet out of control to Earth. By initiating the satellite\u2019s demise, NASA could control the landing area of the 17-ton (15,400-kilogram or 15.4-tonne) spacecraft. Some critics charged NASA with being too conservative, because it had based its decision on the 1-in- 1,000 odds that an uncontrolled descent of the satellite to Earth would result in injuries.(James Orberg, \u201cPlan To Scrap Satellite Sacrifices Science,\u201d USA Today, 24 May 2000; Associated Press, \u201cNASA To Destroy Compton Satellite After Nine Years,\u201d 28 May 2000.)",

Japan\u2019s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science expected the 510-kilogram (1,124-pound) spacecraft to arrive at the asteroid in June 2005. The craft would then skim the surface several times over three months, collecting 1 gram (0.04 ounces) of surface material from various sites. The Institute had designed the mission to return the samples to Earth in a capsule in June 2007. If the probe succeeded, the samples would be the first space rocks collected since the end of the U.S. Apollo Lunar Exploration Program 30 years before.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 595; Eric Talmadge for Associated Press, \u201cJapan Launches Rocket To Probe Asteroid,\u201d 9 May 2003.)",

        "story": "The U.S. House Committee on Science held a hearing to discuss NASA\u2019s FY 2006 budgetary request and priorities. Committee Chair Sherwood L. Boehlert (R-NY) expressed doubt that NASA would receive the full US$16.45 billion it had requested. Committee members questioned Deputy Administrator Frederick D. Gregory on several topics: NASA\u2019s long-term plan to return to the Moon and to send a human mission to Mars; its projected cuts to science and astronautics programs; its decision not to fund a servicing mission to the HST; and its plans for its workforce. The committee also questioned the US$858 million NASA had designated for Mars and lunar exploration, while reducing spending in other space science programs, including that of the HST. The committee questioned budgetary proposals based on plans for 28 Shuttle flights to the ISS and no flights to repair the HST. Representative Vernon J. Ehlers (R-MI) remarked that that the HST was capable of conducting more and better scientific research in one week than the ISS could produce in its entire lifetime. Boehlert reminded NASA officials that the U.S. Congress had never endorsed or even discussed the President\u2019s January 2004 declaration urging NASA to return humans to the Moon within 15 years and, ultimately, to launch human missions to Mars and beyond. Representative Bart Gordon (D-TN) remarked that Congress had no consensus regarding the proposed changes in NASA\u2019s priorities, changes that he described as \u201calmost staggering in terms of magnitude.\u201d(James Janega, \u201cHouse Science Panel Questions NASA Officials about Budget,\u201d Chicago Tribune, 18 February 2005; Jim Abrams, \u201cLawmakers Question White House on NASA,\u201d Kansas City Star (MO), 18 February 2005; U.S.)",

        "story": "The GAO published a report warning that the lack of a detailed, long-term strategy regarding NASA\u2019s workforce could threaten the safety of Space Shuttle operations and delay implementation of the Bush administration\u2019s 2004 directive to return astronauts to the Moon. The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation had tasked GAO with tracking NASA\u2019s efforts to develop a strategy for sustaining the Space Shuttle workforce until the Shuttle\u2019s retirement and identifying factors that impeded those efforts. GAO reported that NASA had made limited progress toward this goal. GAO found that NASA had taken preliminary steps: identifying lessons learned from the retirement of programs comparable to the Space Shuttle, such as the Air Force Titan 4 Rocket Program; enlisting the assistance of human capital experts; and revising its acquisition strategy for updating specific prime contracts. However, GAO concluded that NASA\u2019s failure to make decisions regarding contractor requirements during the remainder of the Shuttle program would hinder its progress. Moreover, GAO stated that NASA must develop a detailed strategy for retiring the Shuttle program, to enable it to protect agency-wide goals from the potential impact of workforce problems. GAO cited several factors hampering NASA\u2019s ability to accomplish this, such as NASA\u2019s near-term focus on returning the Shuttle to flight, a focus that had caused a delay in assessing hardware and facility needs. Furthermore, program officials remained uncertain about how to implement future aspects of the President\u2019s Vision for Space Exploration.(U.S. Government Accountability Office, \u201cSpace Shuttle: Actions Needed To Better Position NASA To Sustain Its Workforce Through Retirement\u201d (report no.

Engineers had designed the craft to obtain the first compositional and gravity maps of the Moon. G. Scott Hubbard, NASA\u2019s Lunar Prospector Mission Manager at Ames Research Center, praised contractor Lockheed Martin for its efficient construction and for keeping project costs at forecasted levels. NASA projected that the total cost to build Lunar Prospector and send it to the Moon would be about US$63 million. Scientists explained the need to return to the Moon, even though it was \u201cconquered\u201d decades ago, reminding the public that many important questions about the Moon\u2019s history and its fundamental composition remained unexplored. Researchers hoped that Lunar Prospector\u2019s planned one-year mission orbiting the Moon would create a detailed map of the Moon\u2019s surface composition and gravitational and magnetic fields. Lunar Prospector itself was compact⎯only 4.5 feet (1.37 meters) high, 4 feet (1.22 meters) in diameter, and weighing 660 pounds (300 kilograms). Even before its launch, scientists hailed Lunar Prospector as a new type of pathfinder, which had \u201cmade history in terms of management style, technical approach, cost management, and focused science.\u201d Prospector used a gamma-ray spectrometer to provide maps of the composition of the Moon, thereby allowing scientists to understand better the elements present in the surface layer of the Moon.",

The previous six months had been the longest period in NASA\u2019s history without any launches since the Challenger disaster, which grounded the Shuttle fleet for two and one-half years. However, problems with the Shuttle fleet had not caused the delay during recent months. Delays in the construction of a critical Russian- built component for the International Space Station (ISS), as well as ongoing problems with a grounded NASA x-ray telescope, had disrupted the launch schedule. Discovery\u2019s crew included Commander Kent V. Rominger, Pilot Rick D. Husband, and Mission Specialists Ellen Ochoa, Tamara E. Jernigan, Daniel T. Barry, Julie Payette, and Valery I. Tokarev. During the 10-day ISS Assembly Mission 2A.1, the crew planned to deliver supplies to the ISS; to repair U.S. and Russian equipment; to install mufflers that would reduce the noise of the Russian fans; and to conduct a spacewalk, attaching one crane and part of another to the outside of the station. STS- 96 (ISS 2A.1) was the first mission to dock with the new ISS.(NASA, \u201cMission Archives: STS-96, Second International Space Station Flight,\u201d http://www.nasa.gov/mission_ pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-96.html (accessed 6 February 2008); Marcia Dunn for Associated Press, \u201cSpace Shuttle,\u201d 27 May 1999.)",

        "story": "The U.S. House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearing to examine NASA\u2019s proposal to reduce spending on aviation research by 20 percent over five years, which would necessitate the closure of some wind tunnels and other centers. Overall, the Bush administration had proposed a 2.4 percent increase in NASA\u2019s budget, with most of that increase directed toward funding travel to the Moon and Mars, initiatives requiring NASA to eliminate or reduce its other programs, such as aviation research. NASA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Aeronautics Research J. Victor Lebacqz defended the program, remarking that the United States remained a global power in aviation and had developed technologies to improve safety, reduce environmental impact, and increase efficiency of aviation operations. However, Lebacqz stated that NASA needed a clearer vision for the goals of the program. John M. Klineberg, a retired NASA official and industry executive, who had headed a National Research Council (NRC) study group in 2004, testified before the committee. The NRC study group had published a review of NASA\u2019s aeronautics programs. Klineberg warned against using the group\u2019s recommendations out of context to justify major cuts in programs. He testified that NASA\u2019s proposed aviation-research budget was a disaster, putting the program at risk of becoming irrelevant to the future of aeronautics in the United States and throughout the world. In an interview following the hearing, Klineberg emphasized that the study group had suggested consolidating and focusing programs but did not support budgetary cuts eliminating entire areas of research.(Warren E.

The launch took place only hours after an independent task force chaired by astronaut Lieutenant General Thomas P. Stafford II reported that the Mir mission was sufficiently safe for the American astronauts. Specifically, the panel had determined that sending astronaut David A. Wolf to replace C. Michael Foale aboard the Russian space station would be reasonable, as well as important to continuing scientific research. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin made the last-minute decision for the mission to go forward after weighing the panel\u2019s findings against NASA\u2019s risk reports and the opinions of the House Committee on Science and Technology. Committee Chairperson F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) had been particularly aggressive in calling for the end of the program to place astronauts aboard Mir for significant periods. James D. Wetherbee served as Commander of Space Shuttle Atlantis, embarking on his fourth flight to space. The Shuttle also carried Jean-Loup Chrétien of the French Space Agency, Vladimir G. Titov of the Russian Space Agency, Pilot Michael J. Bloomfield, and Mission Specialists Scott E. Parazynski, Wendy B. Lawrence, and David A. Wolf. The Shuttle carried the SPACEHAB module in its payload, with supplies for Mir research and logistical equipment aboard.(NASA, \u201cPanels Give Astronaut a \u2018Go\u2019 for Launch to Mir,\u201d news release 97-214, 25 September 1997; NASA, \u201cAstronaut Wolf Continuing American Presence on Mir, Joint US-Russian Spacewalk Highlights STS-86 Mission,\u201d news release J97-27, September 1997; Traci Watson, \u201cAmid Controversy, Atlantis Lifts Off,\u201d USA Today, 26 September 1997; Associated Press, \u201cAstronaut Leaves for Tour on Mir,\u201d 26 September 1997.)",

The NASA- sponsored committee\u2019s investigation concluded that life in forms different from those on Earth is possible and that good reason exists to suspect that various types of chemistry could potentially support life.

The committee found that the generally accepted fundamental requirements for life\u2014a liquid water biosolvent, a carbon-based metabolism, a molecular system capable of evolution, and the ability to exchange energy with the environment\u2014are not the only means of supporting the phenomena scientists recognize as life.

The probe's cargo -- atomic bits of the Sun collected during more than two years in outer space -- is the first extraterrestrial material that NASA has brought back to Earth since Apollo 17 astronauts collected rocks from the Moon in 1972. Scientists hope the material will tell them about the solar system's primordial building materials of gas and dust that later turned into planets.",

NASA had launched Genesis in August 2001 to collect particle samples from solar winds, samples that scientists hoped would provide information about the solar system\u2019s chemical composition during its formation stages. To return Genesis to Earth, NASA had designed the capsule to release a rectangular parachute, which helicopters would grab, gently lowering the spacecraft to Earth. However, the parachute failed to deploy, and Genesis crashed into a desert area of Utah at nearly 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour). Although NASA officials were uncertain about the extent of damage to the spacecraft\u2019s cargo, their initial prognosis was that researchers could still use some of the samples in scientific analyses.(Guy Gugliotta, \u201cSpacecraft Crashes with Solar Data,\u201d Washington Post, 9 September 2004; NASA JPL, \u201cGenesis: Mission History\u2015Launch,\u201d 23 June 2008, http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/gm2/mission/launch.htm (accessed 7 May 2009).)",

Sturckow; Pilot Lee J. Archambault; Mission Specialists James F. Reilly II, Patrick G. Forrester, Steven R. Swanson, and John D. Olivas; and Flight Engineer Clayton C. Anderson, who would replace Sunita L. Williams on board the ISS as a member of ISS Expeditions 15 and 16. The launch was nearly flawless. Only one potential problem occurred several minutes into the flight, when on- board cameras captured an image that appeared to show foam flaking off the Shuttle\u2019s external fuel tank, just after the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) had separated from the orbiter. According to Shuttle Program Manager N. Wayne Hale Jr., NASA\u2019s preliminary analysis of the incident indicated that the foam had not struck the craft. NASA planned further analysis.(NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s Shuttle Atlantis Begins Mission to the Space Station,\u201d news release 07-136, 8 June 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jun/HQ_07136_Atlantis_launch.html (accessed 13 April 2010); NASA, \u201cSTS-117 (21st Space Station Flight),\u201d NASAfacts, http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/177714main_STS-117.pdf (accessed 21 May 2010), John Johnson Jr., \u201cFlawless Launch, At Last, For Atlantis,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 9 June 2007.)",

        "story": "Opportunity\u2014one of NASA\u2019s robotic Mars rovers\u2014began exploring the Victor Crater, an area of Mars that NASA scientists hoped would provide researchers with the most useful data yet acquired about the planet\u2019s history. Arriving at the crater\u2019s rim, Opportunity began sending a volley of color panoramic images. However, before Opportunity actually entered the crater, NASA scientists planned for the robotic rover to circle it, determining a good location to enter and eventually to exit the site. The crater, which measures nearly 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers) wide and 200 feet (61 meters) deep, is five times larger than any of the five craters the two Mars rovers, Opportunity and Spirit, had visited previously. Because of the crater\u2019s size and depth, it has many layers of exposed rock. The images that the rover captured would enable scientists to view and analyze the rock layers. The study of these layers would provide clues to the planet\u2019s geological and meteorological history, such as indications of when Mars had liquid water.(Marc Kaufman, \u201cOpportunity Panoramas of Martian Crater Thrill Scientists,\u201d Washington Post, 7 October 2006; Mark Carreau, \u201cOn Mars, NASA Finds a \u2018Tremendously Important Scientific Discovery,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 7 October 2006.)",

NASA had drafted the 172-page report to apply lessons learned from the Columbia disaster to NASA\u2019s other programs. The report identified seven areas of concern, such as inconsistencies in monitoring the ISS\u2019s hardware, lack of training for personnel administering equipment problems, and an incomplete set of blueprints for hardware. In their response to the report, NASA managers stated that the ISS program had no major problems and that NASA was already pursuing measures to improve the station\u2019s operations. For example, NASA had worked to minimize the sources of debris that could hit the ISS. In addition, NASA had expanded an existing agreement with U.S. intelligence agencies to use intelligence satellites to examine the ISS for damages. Managers also noted that they planned to install additional cameras to the station\u2019s exterior and that, during future spacewalks, astronauts would photograph the ISS more extensively.(Warren E.

NASA had enlisted U.S. Air Force engineers to make the repairs. The spacecraft\u2019s need for repairs increased the tension surrounding the ambitious and expensive mission. Lieutenant Ken Hoffman of the U.S. Air Force, who supervised the repairs, attempted to reassure the public that the problem was \u201ca correctable condition.\u201d Nevertheless, opponents of the mission⎯particularly those opposed to the spacecraft\u2019s use of radioactive plutonium⎯worried that the rocket\u2019s launch might release hazardous materials. Michio Kaku, a City University of New York physics professor, said that, despite NASA\u2019s announcement that it could quickly correct the problem, the leak was \u201cjust one more indication that NASA does not have things under control.\u201d(Robyn Suriano, \u201cCassini Won\u2019t Be Delayed,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 9 August 1997.)",

        "story": "The embattled effort to launch the Cassini spacecraft suffered a setback when NASA engineers discovered ripped insulation in its Huygens probe, while the craft was sitting on the launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Investigators concluded that a ground-air-conditioner malfunction had caused the tears. The possibility of a launch delay, even for only a few days, concerned scientists, because Saturn was moving farther and farther from Earth. A longer journey to Saturn would require the spacecraft to use more fuel for transport, leaving less for scientific exploration. The Cassini Mission to Saturn had received significant public criticism because 72 pounds (33 kilograms) of plutonium⎯the largest amount of radioactive material ever rocketed into space⎯powered the probe. Although protesters had organized marches and petitioned government officials to stop the launch, NASA spokesperson Douglas Isbell had pointed out NASA\u2019s perfect record of using nuclear fuel safely. Scientists from the European Space Agency and NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) had planned and engineered the building of the 23rd nuclear-powered Cassini for the 11-year mission. Experts from both sides of the Atlantic were optimistic that engineers would repair the insulation damage quickly.(John Noble Wilford, \u201cDelay Expected for Spacecraft Going to Saturn,\u201d New York Times, 4 September 1997; John Kennedy and Seth Borenstein, \u201cNuclear Launch Draws Protest,\u201d Orlando Sentinel (FL), 30 August 1997; Sharon K.

NASA had developed the repair techniques in response to recommendations from the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. During the spacewalk, the two astronauts also performed several tasks to upgrade the ISS, such as replacing a broken GPS antenna and installing a bracket designed to hold a toolbox and parts kit for use during future spacewalks.(Warren E.

Robinson completed a final spacewalk during which Robinson performed an unprecedented maneuver to complete a critical operation of the orbiter\u2019s thermal protection system. The principle objective of the spacewalk was to remove two pieces of protruding heat shielding\u2015called gap fillers\u2015from the bottom of the orbiter. NASA was concerned that the fillers might add extra heat to the orbiter\u2019s heat- shielding tiles upon reentry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, thereby threatening the mission. Astronauts James M. Kelly and Wendy B. Lawrence used the robotic arms of the Shuttle and those of the ISS to lower Robinson to the underside of Discovery, while Noguchi monitored the operation. Despite concerns that Robinson might lose communication with the other astronauts, the operation was a success. The maneuver was the first time that an astronaut had worked on the underside of an orbiter while in space. During the spacewalk, Noguchi and Robinson also installed an external stowage platform and a new iteration of an experiment to test materials in the environment of space.(NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s Spacewalking Astronaut Completes Unique Repair,\u201d news release 05-212, 3 August 2005; NASA, \u201cSpace Shuttle Mission Archives: STS-114,\u201d http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/ shuttlemissions/archives/sts-114.html (accessed 24 June 2009).)",

NASA officials responded to the publication of the document, stating that the provisional contingency plan had been one of many ideas considered for improving Space Shuttle safety.(John Schwartz, \u201cNASA Rescue Plan Is Reported To Have High Risk of Failure,\u201d New York Times, 9 July 2004.)",

The flight was also the first free flight of an aircraft powered by a supersonic combustion ramjet enginea scramjeta type of engine that provides thrust by funneling air and fuel into a hollow chamber at extremely high speed. The 12-foot-long (3.7-meter-long) unpiloted, experimental aircraft flew for approximately 11 seconds over the Pacific Ocean, at an altitude of 95,000 feet (approximately 29,000 meters), before NASA deliberately landed the aircraft in the ocean. NASA used a modified B-52 aircraft to carry the X-43A into the sky, launching the X-43A into flight using a Pegasus rocket mounted to the B-52. The test flight, which took place near San Nicolas Island off the California coast, originated from NASA\u2019s DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base in California.(Peter Pae, \u201cFast Times at 12 O\u2019Clock High: 5,000 MPH,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 28 March 2004; NASA, \u201cX-43A Soars on Scramjet Power,\u201d 27 March 2004.)",

The crew had used the robotic arms of both Atlantis and the ISS to install the truss. STS-110 was the first mission in which the crew had used the ISS\u2019s robotic arm to maneuver crew members around the station as they performed spacewalks. In addition, it was the first mission in which the crew\u2019s base for all of its spacewalks was the ISS\u2019s Quest Airlock. The Shuttle\u2019s crew had also engaged in joint operations with the ISS\u2019s Expedition 4 crew.

Morgan, who had been Christa McAuliffe\u2019s backup during NASA\u2019s teacher-in-space program, had been a spectator at KSC when Space Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after launch on 28 January 1986. After the accident, Morgan had returned to teaching. However, in 1998 she had joined the Astronaut Corps. She was participating in STS-118 as a Mission Specialist, not as a teacher. Endeavour\u2019s payload included the Starboard 5 (S5) truss, the Spacehab module, and external stowage platform 3, with a replacement control moment gyroscope (CMG). The mission, Endeavour\u2019s 20th, was the first in almost five years. The Columbia tragedy in 2003 had extended Endeavour\u2019s time on the ground. Following its last mission in December 2002, Endeavour had undergone a major overhaul involving over 194 modifications, including GPS receivers, a modern glass cockpit, a system for docking at the ISS, and a system for monitoring the three engines during launch. NASA had also replaced more than 2,000 of Endeavour\u2019s heat tiles and blankets and more than 3,000 gap fillers between its tiles. The overhauled Shuttle seemed to launch flawlessly. NASA observed one debris event on live video, but the object appeared to have missed the orbiter.(NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s Shuttle Endeavour Begins Mission to the Space Station,\u201d news release 07-173, 8 August 2007; NASA Kennedy Space Center, \u201cSTS-118: Endeavour,\u201d NASA Facts no.

NASA planned the 10-day Shuttle Mission STS-82 to upgrade significantly the scientific capabilities of HST, as well as to perform standard maintenance on the US$2 billion instrument. The spaceflight was the second servicing mission for HST since its deployment in April 1990 aboard Shuttle Discovery\u2019s Mission STS-31. The astronauts planned to conduct at least four spacewalks to install new components, such as the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer. A NASA scientist described the improvements as \u201creplacing 1970\u2019s technology with 1990\u2019s technology.\u201d In addition to the work conducted on the HST, Discovery\u2019s crew planned to move the telescope a few miles farther into the atmosphere, improving its chances for a longer operating life. Astronomers hypothesized that the potential gains from refurbishing the HST outweighed the risks of tampering with its already spectacular abilities, justifying the US$800 million cost of the mission. The head of the HarvardSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics speculated that the refurbished HST could lead to \u201ca whole different kind of science.\u201d(NASA, \u201cSpace Shuttle Mission STS-82\u2014Press Kit,\u201d news release 97-18, February 1997; John Noble Wilford, \u201cShuttle Starts Space Telescope Mission,\u201d New York Times, 12 February 1997; Associated Press, \u201cImproved Hubble Telescope To Give Astronomers New View of the Universe,\u201d 8 February 1997.)",

Astronauts would install the ELCs outside the space station on the central truss during one of the three scheduled spacewalks. Most of the spare parts, which included two steering gyroscopes, a group of tanks, pumps for the ISS cooling system, and a hand for a robotic arm, would remain packed indefinitely until a need for them arose.

        "story": "Space Shuttle Atlantis arrived at the ISS on mission STS-129. With the assistance of a robotic arm, NASA astronauts immediately unloaded one of two ELCs: a 16-foot-by-14-foot (5-meter- by-4-meter) platform, containing pumps, storage tanks, and other equipment weighing hundreds of pounds apiece. All of the equipment was too large to launch aboard any vehicle other than the Shuttle. With only five launches to go before the scheduled 2010 retirement of the Space Shuttle program, NASA planned for the Shuttles to carry to the ISS as many spare parts as possible in the time remaining. In addition to spare parts sent to the ISS for storage, Atlantis had also carried thousands of microscopic specimens. NASA intended to use the specimens in experiments studying the effect of gravity on human muscle development and physiology. Upon the docking of Atlantis with the ISS, NASA astronaut Nicole P. Stott, who had been on board the ISS for approximately three months, became a member of the Shuttle crew. Stott would return home on board Atlantis at the conclusion of STS-129.(Marcia Dunn for Associated Press, \u201cShuttle Docks at Space Station, Unloads Parts,\u201d 19 November 2009; Agence France-Presse, \u201cShuttle Atlantis Docks with Space Station,\u201d 19 November 2009.)",

Atlantis crew delivered and equipped the ISS with nearly 30,000 pounds (13,608 kilograms, or 13.6 tonnes) of critical spare parts. Atlantis crew also conducted three spacewalks in which astronauts completed extra tasks. The Shuttle crew also worked with five U.S., Russian, and European astronauts on board the ISS, to establish power, cooling, and airway connections ahead of the scheduled February arrival of the Tranquility module. The Shuttle and ISS crews also installed new external communications systems to facilitate future maintenance of the space station. Atlantis returned with ISS resident Nicole P.

Mark Stephenson of the Boeing Company, which had built the US$1.4 billion research module, called the vessel \u201cthe crown jewel\u201d of the ISS. NASA had set high stakes on the Destiny laboratory, which was so expensive and complicated to build, that NASA could not afford to assemble a backup module. Therefore, any problem in the transport and connection of the Destiny module would set back the ISS several years. NASA had delayed Atlantis\u2019s mission for three weeks when engineers discovered evidence that faulty wiring might compromise the Shuttle\u2019s safety. The vital mission brought the ISS closer to becoming the permanent and highly functional research station that NASA and the international space community had long awaited. The Destiny laboratory measured 28 feet (9 meters) long, weighed more than 30,000 pounds (13,600 kilograms), and held 13 computers. NASA expected to control the ISS using the computers and communications equipment built into Destiny. Because of the Space Shuttle\u2019s cargo, some officials speculated that Atlantis\u2019s mission was the most important for NASA\u2019s research agenda ever undertaken. One NASA spokesperson called the Destiny module \u201cthe cornerstone for space-based research aboard the orbiting platform.\u201d The STS-98 crew consisted of Commander Kenneth D. Cockrell; Pilot Mark L. Polansky; and Mission Specialists Robert L. Curbeam Jr., Thomas D. Jones, and Marsha S.

After patching up a small leak from one of the module\u2019s coolant lines, two spacewalking astronauts connected electrical, fluid, and data lines between the ISS and the Destiny laboratory. After carefully completing the installation, astronauts opened a hatch connecting the new module to the rest of the ISS.

The spacewalk was the 100th in the history of U.S. space exploration. Two days earlier, Jones and Curbeam had conducted a spacewalk to install a window shutter for Destiny, allowing the astronauts residing inside the ISS an unparalleled view of Earth. Overall, the mission to install the vital and expensive Destiny module went smoothly. Atlantis\u2019s crew worked quickly to connect the necessary cables, hatches, and wires to equip the new research center. The successful installation also allowed NASA to accept a transfer of leadership from the Russian Space Agency. Using the newly installed computers in the Destiny module, U.S. flight controllers took control of the ISS on 13 February 2001.",

But when Cassandra refused to repay his generosity with sexual favors, Apollo put a curse on her: her prophecies -- all of disaster -- would be accurate but nobody would understand or believe her. The Cassandra myth has been adopted by the modern investment community as a metaphor for foretelling disaster. For Ellen McGirt, the stockbroker-turned-Web-site-producer behind Cassandra's Revenge, the tale (adjusting it liberally) is a metaphor for the plight of women seeking to become investors. Given the right information, Ms. McGirt said, women should learn to trust their own prophecies and heed their own investment advice.",

Thompson had requested the study, which found that government specialists were able to penetrate several mission-critical systems and could have stolen, modified, or destroyed system software and data. GAO had found that 135 of the 155 mission-critical systems reviewed did not meet all of NASA\u2019s requirements for risk assessment. Specifically, NASA had not conducted an Agency-wide review of information-technology security since 1991; 60 percent of reviewed systems had not been independently audited for security or weaknesses; NASA had no security training program; and NASA field centers did not report security incidents to a central location. GAO had also found that NASA had no policy for determining what type of information its staff could post on public Web sites, rendering it vulnerable to Internet attacks. NASA also had no policy for protecting mission-critical systems from well-known Internet threats.(Federal Document Clearing House, \u201cThompson Says NASA Must Tighten Computer Security,\u201d government news release, 20 May 1999; U.S. General Accounting Office, \u201cInformation Security: Many NASA Mission-Critical Systems Face Serious Risks\u201d (report no.

The White House had made the proposal as a cost- reduction measure in its proposed budget for FY 2002. At the request of NASA and the NSF, a National Research Council (NRC) panel had assessed the proposal and concluded that NASA should not assume this responsibility. According to the panel, the NSF\u2019s relations with the academic community and its commitments to investigator-initiated and interdisciplinary research made the NSF better suited than NASA to sponsor ground-based astronomy and astrophysics research. The panel also concluded that the federal government could maximize the benefits of astronomy and astrophysics research by creating an interagency astronomy and astrophysics planning board to develop an integrated research strategy. The NRC panel\u2019s report suggested that such a strategy should include ways of supporting ground- and space-based facilities and missions, and that NASA and the NSF should create formal mechanisms to implement the planning board\u2019s recommendations.(NRC, U.S. Astronomy and Astrophysics: Managing an Integrated Program (Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 2001); James Glanz, \u201cReport Warns Against Plan for Changes in Astronomy,\u201d New York Times, 5 September 2001.)",

Confirming a long-held hypothesis, the team of researchers had discovered, in ancient sediments spread across the planet, molecules of stardust that only could have come from space. This discovery led scientists to conclude that the impact of a massive comet had triggered the onset of dormancy of life on Earth. The scientists had examined samples from China, Japan, and Hungary, seeking to explain what had happened on Earth. NASA, which had contributed funding for the project, announced the team\u2019s findings at a panel presentation in Washington, DC.(Luann Becker et al., \u201cImpact Event at the Permian-Triassic Boundary: Evidence from Extraterrestrial Noble Gases in Fullerenes,\u201d Science 291, no. 5508 (23 February 2001): 15301533; Guy Gugliotta, \u201cComet Tied To a Mass Extinction; Sediments Show Earth Was Hit, Scientists Say,\u201d Washington Post, 23 February 2001; NASA, \u201cNext Space Science Update: Trigger Found for Largest Mass Extinction,\u201d news release N01-10, 20 February 2001.)",

The crew received a congratulatory call from President George W. Bush, praising their successful 13- day mission. By the time that Atlantis and its crew departed the ISS, the Shuttle had significantly boosted the space station\u2019s orbit, leaving the ISS orbiting at about 237 miles (381 kilometers) above Earth. While attached to the space station, Atlantis had used a series of engine bursts to push the ISS approximately 16 miles (26 kilometers) higher than its previous position. Shuttle crew had also unloaded food and supplies, including an enormous Russian carbon-dioxide removal unit, for the use of the three-person ISS crew during their visit.(Associated Press, \u201cShuttle Back on Earth After Dismal Three Days,\u201d 21 February 2001; Associated Press, \u201cAtlantis Leaves Space Station in a Higher Orbit,\u201d 16 February 2001.)",

        "story": "In the CAIB\u2019s third public meeting, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Aloysius G. Casey, a retired three-star general and former Director of the Space Division of Air Force Systems Command, presented his opinions about the Columbia disaster, based on his decades of experience with missiles and rocket systems. Casey shared with the Board his knowledge of high-speed impacts, referring to the insulating foam that had fallen from the Shuttle\u2019s external tank 81 seconds after the 16 January launch. He also shared his knowledge of the level of testing necessary to determine whether a system is qualified to fly. Casey stated that NASA needed to \u201cdo a better job in quantifying the safety margins for all of the shuttle\u2019s various systems and be more sensitive to clues the hardware may be offering when things don\u2019t work as designed.\u201d Board Chairperson Harold W. Gehman Jr., remarking that the \u201csubject of \u2018successful flights don\u2019t re-establish margins\u2019 has come back again and again,\u201d called Casey\u2019s insight very helpful. However, Roy D. Bridges Jr., Director of NASA\u2019s KSC, noted that he had never considered falling foam to be a safety issue and that it had never caused \u201cany significant damage in the program to date.\u201d Rather than a safety issue, Bridges had considered the foam a maintenance concern. Bridges commented that if he had been aware of the safety implications, he would have recommended a stop to flying.(Jim Banke, \u201cNASA Missed Trouble Signs, Expert Tells Columbia Board,\u201d Space.com, 25 March 2003, http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/sts107_caib_030325.html (accessed 29 August 2008).)",

Though a piece of foam may be found ultimately responsible, as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board announced last week, on some level I feel personally culpable for the loss of the seven astronauts. In-orbit experiments like mine have been used to justify manned space projects like the shuttle for decades. The truth is that the vast majority of scientific experiments conducted in orbit -- including my own -- do not require astronauts. The main reason for in-orbit experimentation is to observe how a scientific process works without gravity-driven influences. But almost all of these tests, save those that must be done on humans, can be controlled from the ground via computer or by robots in space. In fact, some of the best work is done this way when the crew is asleep, not moving about and causing vibrations.",

When the satellite came within 500 to 1,000 yards (457 to 914 meters) of Mir, U.S. astronaut C. Michael Foale and the two resident Russian cosmonauts sealed themselves in the Soyuz spacecraft so that they would be able to leave if the satellite hit the station. According to NASA, problems with space debris and close encounters between satellites are common, but usually miles, rather than yards, separated the rapidly traveling spacecraft. Russian space officials had taken a different approach to the situation than their American counterparts would have chosen. Rather than ordering Mir to adjust its position, as NASA had instructed Shuttle crews to do when debris approach, Russian officials had ordered Mir\u2019s crew back into Soyuz, prepared to take off immediately. The near miss of Mir and the satellite was not the first time that Mir had received a collision alert. NASA had begun monitoring Mir\u2019s path when American astronauts joined the permanent crew and reported that space debris passed within a few kilometers of Mir about once every six weeks.(Edmund L.

The screw had probably dislodged during takeoff, falling into the gears of the hatch. NASA had decided to cancel the spacewalks, rather than force the hatch open and risk damaging it permanently. With the Shuttle scheduled to launch again in one month, NASA faced the question of whether to remove and replace the gearboxes on all the hatches inside the Shuttle as a precautionary measure.(Associated Press, \u201cLoose Screw Caused Stuck Hatch on Shuttle,\u201d 12 December 1996; Associated Press, \u201cNASA Hatching Up Plan in Case Emergency Spacewalk Is Needed,\u201d 2 December 1996.)",

Discovery had to alter its approach to the space telescope, because the telescope\u2019s failed gyroscopes had \u201cleft the telescope a little shaky,\u201d but Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr. and his crew had prepared for such a scenario. A fully operational HST would have had its aft pointed at the center of Earth; Brown would have carried out a straightforward approach, rising up from below until the robotic arm simply locked on. Without its gyroscopes functioning, the HST slowly rotated at one revolution per hour. Therefore, controllers activated backup gyroscopes to eliminate the rotation as much as possible, permitting Brown to fly around the HST and properly position the Shuttle\u2019s robotic arm. As both spacecraft traveled around the Earth at 17,500 miles (28,000 kilometers) per hour with Brown at the controls, Discovery moved closer to the HST until French astronaut Jean-François Clervoy had removed the 43-foot (13-meter), 25,000-pound (11,300-kilogram) telescope from orbit and anchored it in the Shuttle cargo bay.(Associated Press, \u201cDiscovery Astronauts Capture Hubble Telescope for Repairs,\u201d Washington Times, 22 December 1999; William Harwood, \u201cDiscovery Catches Up with Hubble for a Service Call in Space,\u201d Washington Post, 22 December 1999.)",

Astronaut Jean-François Clervoy operated the arm, grabbing a handle on the telescope\u2019s side. After releasing the latches securing the observatory inside the Shuttle\u2019s bay, the robotic arm lifted the telescope above the spacecraft, and ground controllers opened the door covering HST\u2019s telescopic eye. Once ground controllers gave the command, Discovery\u2019s robotic arm released the telescope. Commander Curtis L. Brown Jr. and Pilot Scott J. Kelly fired the Shuttle\u2019s thrusters to move away from the telescope slowly.(Robyn Suriano, \u201cHubble Set Free: Discovery\u2019s Crew Ready for Monday Landing at KSC,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 26 December 1999.)",

Tip to tip the solar arrays spanned a distance of 240 feet (73 meters). With the solar arrays added to the left and right sides of the new power module, the ISS achieved an unprecedented symmetry in its appearance. In the midst of the solar-array- deployment operation, a fire alarm sounded in the Russian sector of the ISS, but crew and mission managers quickly determined that a computer malfunction was the cause. Russian computers, working in conjunction with American computers, had failed, and attempts to reboot the Russian computers had triggered the false fire alarm. However, because of the computer failure, the small maneuvering jets on Atlantis had assumed control of the ISS\u2019s attitude, placing the station\u2019s solar panels in a poor position for gathering sunlight and causing power levels to drop. Mission Control ordered the crew to turn off some nonessential equipment until the ISS regained attitude control. Thereafter, engineers successfully reestablished gyroscope control, and the left-side array began tracking the Sun properly.(Houston Chronicle, \u201cNew Solar Array,\u201d 13 June 2007; John Schwartz, \u201cGlitch Blamed for Fire Alarm on Orbiter,\u201d New York Times, 13 June 2007; William Harwood, \u201cComputer Glitches Impact Station Attitude Control,\u201d Spaceflight Now, 12 June 2007.)",

Rees, born in Germany, had graduated from the Dresden Institute of Technology in 1934 with an advanced degree in mechanical engineering. He had worked as a technical plant manager with the German Guided Missile Center beginning in 1940, but after Germany\u2019s defeat in World War II, Rees became one of 118 scientists who surrendered to the West under the so-called Project Paperclip, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1954. In the United States, he had first worked at White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, \u201cwhere he shared his expertise on the V-2, a German rocket- propelled bomb, and on guided missile projects.\u201d In 1950 Rees had moved to Huntsville, Alabama, to serve as Deputy Chief of the Guided Missile Development Division at Redstone Arsenal. Among the projects Rees had managed were the Hermes II Project, the Redstone and Jupiter missile programs, the Explorer satellite project, and the Saturn program. Between 1956 and 1960, Rees had been Deputy Director of the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency\u2019s Development Operations Division.

Launched January 1958, Explorer 1 had captured data revealing two belts of charged particles above Earth\u2019s magnetic field\u2014phenomena later known as the Van Allen radiation belts. The finding was among the first major scientific discoveries of the early space age. In 1958 Van Allen had chaired a group of scientists who recommended that the United States create an independent national space agency by 1960 and launch a human mission to the Moon by 1968. Van Allen later became involved in several NASA projects, including the development of Galileo, Pioneers 10 and 11, and several Mariner spacecraft. During his lifetime, Van Allen had received numerous awards, including the National Medal of Science and NASA\u2019s Medal of Exceptional Achievement.(Walter Sullivan, \u201cJames A.

        "story": "NASA researchers announced that the ER-2, a modified U-2 aircraft, had collected tiny interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) in Earth\u2019s stratosphere, which likely contained bits of ancient stars. The particles, collected over a period of two decades, included the only samples of comets that researchers were able to study in a laboratory. Lindsay Keller, a researcher in the Office of Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science at NASA\u2019s JSC, remarked that the stardust grains were typical of the kind of dust available at the beginning of the solar systemthe building blocks of the Sun and planets. Scott Messenger, an astrophysicist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, described the IDPs as rich in stardust and molecular cloud material, suggesting that the particles had remained essentially unchanged since the solar system\u2019s formation. To detect the remnants of the early stars, scientists had used Washington University\u2019s new type of ion microprobe, which measured isotopic ratios on scales much smaller than previously possible.(NASA, \u201cNASA Finds Remnants of Ancient Stars in Earth\u2019s Upper Atmosphere,\u201d news release 03-084, 27 February 2003, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2003/feb/HP_news_03084.html (accessed 16 July 2008).)",

        "story": "NASA announced that, on 3 September 2000, the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) aboard NASA\u2019s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer Earth Probe (TOMS-EP) satellite had detected an 11 million-square-mile (28.5 million-square-kilometer) ozone-depletion area⎯surpassing the ozone hole\u2019s record of 10.5 million square miles (27.2 million square kilometers) set on 19 September 1998. Scientists investigating the extent of the ozone-depletion area expressed their surprise, suggesting that early-spring conditions and an \u201cextremely intense Antarctic vortex\u201d⎯an upper-altitude stratospheric air current that moves around the continent⎯might partly explain the record-setting size. Jack A. Kaye of the Office of Earth Sciences, Research Director at NASA Headquarters, remarked that, although scientists expect variations in the size of the ozone hole from one year to the next, they plan to observe the evolution of the ozone-depletion area in the coming months, to compare it with previous years. Manager of NASA\u2019s Upper Atmosphere Research Program Michael J. Kurylo suggested that the new data reinforced concerns about the fragile nature of the ozone layer, indicating that, although international agreements had curbed the production of ozone-destroying gases, concentrations of those gases in the stratosphere were just reaching their peak levels. Therefore, he warned that it would be decades before the depletion area in the ozone layer would no longer occur annually. Associate Administrator for Earth Science Enterprise Ghassem R. Asrar commented that such discoveries demonstrated the value of long-term observations.(NASA, \u201cLargest-Ever Ozone Hole Observed over Antarctica,\u201d news release 00-137, 7 September 2000, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2000/00-137.txt (accessed 25 April 2008).)",

Williams conducted their second spacewalk in four days, to finish connecting cooling lines to a permanent system of the ISS. Working for just over 7 hours, the astronauts rerouted a series of two electrical cables and four quick-disconnect fluid lines to the Destiny laboratory\u2019s permanent cooling system; retracted the aft heat-rejecting radiator on the P6 Truss; and finished disconnecting and stowing the second of two fluid lines for the Early Ammonia Servicer. Lopez- Alegria photographed the starboard solar array and the blanket box into which it folds, so that engineers could analyze the photos and finalize plans for its retraction during the Shuttle Mission STS-117, scheduled for March 2007. He also removed a sunshade that the crew no longer needed from a data-relay box, folding the sunshade to bring it inside the ISS, so that the crew could dispose of it later. At the conclusion of the spacewalk, Williams and Lopez-Alegria again followed precautionary decontamination procedures in the ISS\u2019s airlock, as they had on 31 January, because they had seen ammonia flakes early in the spacewalk. Williams set a record for spacewalking time accrued by a woman\u201422 hours and 37 minutes\u2014surpassing the record that NASA astronaut Kathryn C. Thornton had set in 1993.(NASA, \u201cInternational Space Station Status Report: SS07-06\u201d; Marc Carreau, \u201cSpacewalkers Finish Job; Astronauts Sets Record,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 5 February 2007.)",

During the 6-hour-and-15-minute spacewalk at the ISS, the astronauts made power, data, and cooling connections on a new 16-tonne (17.6-ton or 16,000-kilogram) truss segment containing solar arrays. One of STS-117\u2019s objectives was to deliver the new US$367 million solar-power module to the ISS. The ISS partners intended for the arrays to increase the ISS\u2019s power generation substantially and to serve future European and Japanese science modules. Mission managers decided to extend STS-117 two days, in case the crew needed to repair the fabric heat shield on the orbiter\u2019s left tail section. Managers feared that Atlantis\u2019s tail section had sustained damaged shortly after launch.(NASA, \u201cSTS-117 (21st Space Station Flight)\u201d; Jean-Louis Santini for Agence France-Presse, \u201cUS Atlantis Astronauts Step Out on Space Walk,\u201d 12 June 2007; Houston Chronicle, \u201cNew Solar Array Being Unfurled on Space Station,\u201d 13 June 2007.)",

        "story": "NASA reported to the public that Mars Global Surveyor had captured images depicting erosion and soil deposits consistent with the presence of flowing water on the planet in the past. Researchers had long postulated that, billions of years ago, Mars\u2019s surface held abundant water, which had dried up as the planet\u2019s atmosphere thinned. Because scientists had suggested that the one-time presence of water on Mars might indicate the one-time presence of life on the planet, the new evidence created significant excitement in the scientific community. In announcing the find, NASA reported that it \u201ccould turn out to be a landmark discovery,\u201d but cautioned against drawing conclusions from the images without further analysis. Furthermore, the images suggested that water might have been present on the planet more recently than previously thought. Associate Administrator for Space Science Edward J. Weiler explained, \u201cFor two decades scientists have debated whether liquid water might have existed on the surface of Mars just a few billion years ago. With today\u2019s discovery, we\u2019re no longer talking about a distant time. The debate has moved to present-day Mars.\u201d(Kathy Sawyer, \u201cMars Craft Finds Evidence of Water,\u201d Washington Post, 22 June 2000; William F. Nicholson, \u201cReports: NASA Finds Evidence of Water on Mars,\u201d USA Today, 21 June 2000; NASA, \u201cNew Images Suggest Present-Day Sources of Liquid Water on Mars,\u201d news release 00-99, 22 June 2000.)",

Although the test went smoothly, it may be the beginning of the end for Ares I.

The USA 142, also called the DSP 19, an American geosynchronous military satellite, had launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The failed launch had placed the Defense Support Program satellite in a useless orbit after an attached rocket engine failed. This was the first launch attempt since the explosion of a Titan IVA in August 1998. Engineers had designed the Titan IVB, an improved version of the Titan IV, to survive the electrical malfunction that had led to its predecessor\u2019s demise. Because of a policy of secrecy concerning military spy satellites, the U.S. Air Force had delayed informing its public affairs office about the launch failure. Although senior Air Force officials knew of the loss of the satellite, they were unable to make the event public until they were certain that the failure had not entailed the release of classified information. The Air Force had designed the satellite, a highly sensitive, 2-ton (1,800-kilogram or 1.8-tonne), infrared telescope, to detect missile launches and nuclear detonations.(Robyn Suriano, \u201cAir Force Says Security Questions Delayed Announcement,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 13 April 1999; Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 546, 1 May 1999, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx546.html (accessed 28 October 2008).)",

        "story": "Sojourner, the roving vehicle carried to Mars aboard Pathfinder, began prospecting the surface of the Red Planet approximately two days after Pathfinder\u2019s safe landing. NASA engineers and enthralled scientists described the scene of the six-wheeled, microwave-sized Sojourner, slowly descending the ramp of Pathfinder, as similar to Neil A. Armstrong\u2019s \u201cgiant leap\u201d in 1969. Richard A. Cook, managing the mission from JPL, set off a raucous celebration of NASA engineers when he announced, \u201cThe rover is on the surface of Mars. We\u2019ve got some great images back, and all the scientists are in heaven.\u201d Weather reports gathered by the Pathfinder reported that Sojourner was working in temperatures as high as 8° below 0°F (-22°C), as well as in wind and dust storms. Sojourner, named for black abolitionist Sojourner Truth, headed for a dark rock near Pathfinder, as its first object of close study. NASA scientists, who had named the rock Barnacle Bill because of its craggy appearance, used similarly whimsical terms to keep track of the various geological objects studied by Sojourner. Sojourner\u2019s success, after some minor complication upon landing, encouraged mission scientists and drew wide acclaim from the media. Scientists began to speculate almost immediately, about whether the mission could possibly confirm or deny the existence of life on the planet.(John Noble Wilford, \u201cOn the Surface of Mars, Sojourner Rolls to Work,\u201d New York Times, 7 July 1997; Knight- Ridder News Service, \u201cData from Mars Indicate It Could Have Supported Life,\u201d 7 July 1997; Peter N.

Mission STS-84 was the fourth mission of 1997 and the sixth of nine planned missions to the Mir space station. Atlantis carried astronaut C. Michael Foale, who was to replace Jerry M. Linenger as the United States\u2019 long-term resident aboard Mir. Charles J. Precourt served as Commander of Mission STS-84 and Eileen M. Collins as Pilot for the Shuttle. In addition, the crew included U.S. astronauts Carlos I. Noriega and Edward T. Lu and Mission Specialists Elena V. Kondakova of the Russian Space Agency and Jean-François Clervoy of the European Space Agency (ESA). Kondakova was the first Russian woman to fly aboard a NASA Space Shuttle. With the recent problems aboard Mir, many viewed the mission with special urgency. Concerned about the numerous breakdowns and the fire aboard the Russian space station, NASA even considered refusing to allow Foale to take his place aboard Mir. The Shuttle carried to Mir a new oxygen generator, which astronauts planned to unload almost immediately upon docking. Atlantis took into space more than 7,000 pounds (3,200 kilograms) of cargo for Mir and its crew.(NASA, \u201cAtlantis Ready To Fly Sixth Shuttle\u2013Mir Mission,\u201d news release J97-15, May 1997; Associated Press, \u201cSpace Shuttle,\u201d 15 May 1997.)",

        "story": "Using the most sensitive images ever taken by the HST, scientists found new evidence of star creation, challenging the findings of much of the existing research on the origin of the universe. Although the HST had captured images of portions of the skies that appear empty to the naked eye, the images revealed nearly 5,000 galaxies. Led by Kenneth M. Lanzetta of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, a team of scientists had examined approximately 150 of those galaxies spectroscopically, inferring from color variations their actual distance from Earth, as well as the properties of less visible light from even fainter and more distant galaxies. The scientists had also conducted spectroscopic analysis of remote quasars to measure the early universe\u2019s gas density, because high gas density implies high creation rates of stars, which are the building blocks of galaxies and the birthplaces of solar systems. The new images indicated that countless stars had begun forming at a period closer to the birth of the universe than previous research had suggested. Although the HST had captured the images in 1995 and 1998, using the most advanced available technology, the findings suggested that the peak of star creation had occurred earlier than Hubble\u2019s ability to detect it. However, the scientists believed that they could date the peak of star creation to within a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.(NASA, \u201cHubble Suggests First Stars Opened in a Blaze of Glory,\u201d news release 02-01, 8 January 2002; William Harwood, \u201cStars May Have Brightened Infant Universe,\u201d Washington Post, 9 January 2002.)",

        "story": "Astronomers reported the first direct evidence of dark matter, an enigmatic substance whose existence scientists had debated. Various theories had suggested that dark matter composes most of the universe\u2019s matter and helps maintain cosmic structures by binding normal matter\u2014such as galaxies\u2019 composite atoms and hot gas\u2014between galaxies. Dark matter is, theoretically, an invisible substance, which scientists can only detect by its gravitational effects on visible matter and radiation. Therefore, scientists had acquired no direct evidence of it until astronomers, led by Douglas Clowe of the University of Arizona, Tucson, discovered such evidence in images that NASA\u2019s HST and other telescopes had captured. The images showed a collision between two galaxy clusters, an event that scientists believed might have been the most energetic event subsequent to the Big Bang. The collision of the clusters had created a wind, causing the formation of a gas cloud with a bullet-like shape. However, the astronomers determined that the gas cloud does not account for most of the matter in the clusters. Instead, a separate, relatively empty patch of space had exerted a gravitational pull on the gas, thereby slowing it down. Because alternative theories of gravity could not account for these results, the astronomers concluded that dark matter had exerted the gravitational pull from the apparently empty area of space.(NASA, \u201cNASA Finds Direct Proof of Dark Matter,\u201d news release 06-297, 21 August 2006, http://www.nasa. gov/home/hqnews/2006/aug/HQ_06297_CHANDRA_Dark_Matter.html (accessed 15 March 2010); Douglas Clowe et al., \u201cA Direct Empirical Proof of the Existence of Dark Matter,\u201d Astrophysical Journal Letters 648, no. 2 (10)",

The Administration objects to the loan provision, arguing that banks would profit excessively at the expense of other education programs.",

NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin had selected Chabrow to lead the investigation into the cost of the ISS. The task force\u2019s findings concluded that the space station may cost US$7 billion more than the original estimate and may take two years longer than anticipated to complete. Congressional supporters and opponents of the program questioned NASA officials about the project\u2019s cost and slipping timetable, but officials indicated that they needed a few more weeks to study Chabrow\u2019s report and were unable to say whether they agreed with his team\u2019s figures. However, Goldin acknowledged that Russia\u2019s participation in the program was not working. He also promised to provide Congress with a new assessment of costs and with assembly schedules by 15 June, including estimates for continuing the project without critical Russian equipment. House Committee on Science and Technology Chairperson F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-WI) seemed mollified after Goldin had spoken. However, Sensenbrenner \u201cchastised the Clinton administration,\u201d remarking that its failure to send a representative from the Office of Management and Budget to the hearing reflected \u201cthe low priority\u201d the administration placed on solving the problems facing the ISS program.(Warren E.

However, they also noted that the images on the copies were of lower quality than those on the original magnetic tapes, because NASA equipment had been incompatible with television technology when the first human mission to the Moon took place. NASA had displayed the original transmissions of the Moon landing on a monitor and pointing a television camera at the monitor to broadcast the images on television.

Initially, NASA had believed that DART had come within 300 feet (91.4 meters) of the target satellite before low fuel readings prompted it to abort its mission. However, NASA spokesperson Kimberly D. Newton later explained that new data had indicated that DART had bumped the satellite, boosting its orbit by as much as 5.75 miles (9.3 kilometers). However, DART had abandoned its target approximately halfway through its 24-hour mission. The Board consisted of seven voting members from NASA\u2019s MSFC, NASA\u2019s GSFC and ARC; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; and the U.S. Air Force Space Command. NASA assigned eight federal employees to serve as advisors to the Board\u2015six from MSFC, and one each from NASA\u2019s JSC and NASA Headquarters. NASA selected Scott D.

The first two competitions, the Tether Challenge and the Beam Power Challenge, would challenge innovators to focus on developing lightweight, yet strong, tether materials and wireless power transmission technologies. Winners of each of the initial 2005 challenges would receive a prize of US$50,000. The Tether Challenge would require teams to make the strongest tether of a specified diameter. Competing in a tournament-style bracket system, the tethers would be stretched until they broke, with the overall winner competing against NASA\u2019s \u201chouse tether\u201d to win the cash. The Beam Power Challenge would require teams to use wireless technology to lift a weight off the ground.

Rignot of NASA\u2019s JPL and Pannir Kanagaratnam of the University of Kansas Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets, reported in the journal Science that, in the last 10 years, Greenland\u2019s glaciers had doubled the rate at which they were losing ice into the Atlantic Ocean, from 96 cubic kilometers (23 cubic miles) per year in 1996, to 220 cubic kilometers (53 cubic miles) in 2005. Using interferometric synthetic-aperture radar data that Canadian Space Agency\u2019s (CSA\u2019s) Radarsat-1 and ESA\u2019s Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar and Earth Remote Sensing Satellites 1 and 2 had collected between 2000 and 2005, the researchers calculated the volume of ice breaking off the edges of the glaciers and falling into the ocean. They attributed the change in glacial ice flow to an increase in global temperature, suggesting that the resulting melting water was making the undersides of the glaciers more slippery and accelerating the pace at which the glacial ice was sliding into the ocean. This study represented the most comprehensive data on glacial ice flow to date. Researchers noted that, based on this research, scientists might need to revise previous computer models predicting the rate of ocean-level increase.(Andrew Bridges, \u201cGreenland Glaciers Dumping More Ice,\u201d Washington Post, 17 February 2006; NASA \u201cGreenland Ice-Loss Doubles in Past Decade, Raising Sea Levels Faster,\u201d press release 06-066, 16 February 2006, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/feb/HQ_06066_Greenland_ice_melting_ corrected.html (accessed 2 September 2010); see also Eric Rignot and Pannir Kanagaratnam, \u201cChanges in the Velocity Structure of the Greenland Ice Sheet,\u201d Science 311, no. 5763 (17 February 2006): 986−90.)",

The craft experienced computer problems when passing through the densest part of Jupiter\u2019s radiation belt, but 1 hour after Galileo\u2019s closest encounter with Io, all of its systems had resumed normal functioning. Duane Bindschadler, Manager of Science Operations for the Galileo Program, explained that close-up study of Io could help scientists learn about the behavior of volcanoes, thereby helping them predict the behavior of volcanoes on Earth. However, because Jupiter\u2019s radiation field could damage or destroy the spacecraft, NASA had planned the close flyby for the end of the two-year extended mission, following Galileo\u2019s original two-year mission.(NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, \u201cGalileo Succeeds in Historic Flyby of Jupiter\u2019s Volcanic Moon,\u201d news release, 11 October 1999; Reuters, \u201cGalileo Probe Risks Ruin for a Closer Look at Io,\u201d Washington Post, 12 October 1999.)",

However, the ISS partners planned to increase the crew to three members with the next Space Shuttle Discovery flight, scheduled for May 2006, and to increase the crew of the station to six members in 2009. Furthermore, NASA announced its plan to launch 16 Shuttle flights to allow completion of the ISS before the planned retirement of the Shuttles in 2010. To advance the assembly schedule, the Shuttles would transport ESA\u2019s Columbus laboratory module and JAXA\u2019s experiment module Kibo to the ISS during four missions in 2007 and 2008.

NASA had designed the Scientific Applications Satellite-B (SAC-B), launched three days earlier from NASA\u2019s Wallops Flight Facility, to survey solar flares and gamma-ray bursts. The project was a cooperative effort between NASA and Argentina. NASA scientists had intended the second satellite, HETE (High Energy Transient Experiment), to remain dormant until it detected sunlight, at which time it would deploy, transmitting signals. Scientists doubted this would ever occur, because the satellite had fallen into a tumbling pattern. Officials hypothesized that the satellites had not deployed properly and, therefore, had orbited uselessly, lacking electrical power. NASA valued both satellites at more than US$20 million. The launch failure was the third miscue in two years for the Pegasus rocket program. The Orbital Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Virginia, developed and ran the program.(John Mintz, \u201cOrbital Sciences Fails in Another Launch,\u201d Washington Post, 5 November 1996; Associated Press, \u201cNASA Reports Failure of Scientific Satellites,\u201d 7 November 1996; NASA, \u201cSAC-B/HETE Spacecraft No Longer Operational,\u201d news release 96-231, 7 November 1996.)",

The launch took place one day later than expected because, on the original launch date, a commercial fishing boat had come within range of the launch danger zone. Scientists launched ACE toward an imaginary point 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth and 92 million miles (148 million kilometers) from the Sun, a point at which scientists believe that the gravity of the Earth and Sun balance each other. NASA planned for ACE to orbit for as long as five years, analyzing particles streaming from the Sun. In keeping with NASA\u2019s focus on improved efficiency, NASA engineers collaborated with the Boeing Company to build ACE and launch the mission, at a cost of US$200 million⎯more than US$30 million under budget.(Associated Press, \u201cAfter 1-Day Delay, NASA Launches Bargain-Priced Solar Observatory,\u201d 25 August 1997; Associated Press, \u201cLaunch Delayed by Errant Shrimpers,\u201d 25 August 1997.)",

        "story": "Using the HST, astronomers from a number of universities and other institutions reported in Science that they had discovered a massive crater on the asteroid Vesta. Scientists had long suspected that the asteroid might have a large crater, because Vesta is the \u201cparent body\u201d of many smaller asteroids, suggesting that a significant collision once occurred on Vesta. However, even with hints of such a history, the sheer size of Vesta\u2019s crater surprised the observers. Measuring 285 miles (469 kilometers) across, the crater was nearly equal to Vesta\u2019s 330-mile (531- kilometer) diameter. Scientists had waited for the asteroid to move closer to Earth, so that they could examine its surface closely. In May 1996, Vesta had moved within 110 million miles (177 million kilometers) of Earth, its closest approach in a decade. The science team stated further that unveiling Vesta\u2019s complexion and history had yielded new insights into the effects of \u201ca large impact on a small object.\u201d(Peter C.

NASA had previously used private contractors. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin marked the occasion as \u201cthe first day of a new space program in America.\u201d Financial experts forecast that the government-private industry pact might be worth as much as US$12 billion by the end of its 10-year venture. According to the agreement, USA shouldered the responsibility for the 12 Shuttle-related contracts carried out at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. NASA stated that USA might take over additional tasks in the future. NASA had decided to consolidate the Shuttle operations with USA to improve cost efficiency, a vital step in light of congressional budget cuts. Kent Black, the CEO of USA, predicted that the move would save NASA as much as 20 percent of its operating budget for the Shuttle in the first year of the contract alone. Even with the turnover, NASA maintained complete control over planning Shuttle missions, selecting astronauts, and approving launches of the Shuttle. NASA planned to take on an oversight role similar to that of the Federal Aviation Administration, rewarding USA with bonuses for savings and imposing monetary penalties if the company failed to achieve \u201cvery good\u201d safety ratings.(Associated Press, \u201cNASA Turns Shuttle Operations Over to Private Industry,\u201d 30 Sept 1996; Reuters, \u201cNASA Signs $7 Billion Shuttle Pact,\u201d 30 September 1996; United Press International, \u201cNASA signs $12 Billion Shuttle Pact,\u201d 1 October 1996.)",

In yet another use for the HST images, scientists tracked much colder, cloudier, harsher weather conditions than they had expected. R. Todd Clancy of the Space Science Institute attributed Mars\u2019s chaotic weather to a combination of factors, including the planet\u2019s thin atmosphere and elliptical orbit and the ice and dust clouds surrounding it. When the planet\u2019s orbit places it closest to the Sun, large windstorms push dust into the atmosphere; the dust absorbs sunlight, causing the air to heat, and Mars\u2019s temperature to rise as high as 30°F (-1°C). HST images seemed to demonstrate further that, when the planet is farthest from the Sun, the dust storms remain at low altitudes, and ice clouds surround the planet, causing temperatures to plunge precipitously. The findings were of particular importance to NASA\u2019s ongoing Mars Pathfinder Project, with Pathfinder\u2019s entrance into the Martian atmosphere planned for July 1997.(Warren E.

        "story": "At a news conference, NASA scientists announced the preliminary findings of Deep Space 1\u2019s 22 September flyby of Comet Borrelly, a type of comet that originates in a region near Pluto. NASA\u2019s Deep Space 1 spacecraft, operating two years past its planned mission duration, had passed within 1,400 miles (2,250 kilometers) of Borrelly, returning the best images and data of a comet ever captured. The encounter was only the second time that a spacecraft had come within such a distance of a comet\u2019s nucleus, as well as the first close flyby of a comet of Borrelly\u2019s type. In 1986 ESA\u2019s Giotto spacecraft had flown within 373 miles (600 kilometers) of Halley\u2019s comet, which belongs to a category of comets that originate from outside Earth\u2019s solar system. In addition, NASA scientists reported that the data captured by Deep Space 1 had substantially enhanced existing scientific knowledge of comets. Scientists found a number of Deep Space 1\u2019s observations surprising, including the discoveries that the comet\u2019s icy jets discharge in tall columns rather than in a diffuse spray, that a cloud of charged particles emanates from off the comet\u2019s center, and that solar wind flows asymmetrically around the particle cloud.(Warren E.

The craft, built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems and controlled by scientists at NASA\u2019s JPL, had headed to orbit Mars in search of evidence of water on the Red Planet. NASA officials expected the trip to Mars to take more than six months and the data collection to continue for more than two years. NASA had designed Mars Odysseyequipping it with a thermal-emissions imaging system, a gamma- ray spectrometer, and a radiation monitorto investigate further the question of whether Mars might have once supported life. By collecting data about the climate and geology of Mars\u2019s surface, scientists hoped to explore theories regarding the planet\u2019s seemingly harsh climate change. NASA and members of the scientific community watched the US$300 million craft closely, hoping for success.

With the help of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew and Cargo Program Office, SpaceX had tested DragonEye in proximity with the ISS, in preparation for future visits of SpaceX\u2019s Dragon spacecraft to the ISS. DragonEye would guide the Dragon craft as it approached the space station, providing three-dimensional images based on the amount of time needed for a single laser pulse from the sensor to reach a target and to bounce back. DragonEye had used flight data gathered on board Endeavour to detect the ISS successfully and to track it through various approach and departure maneuvers. Following Endeavour\u2019s return to Earth, DragonEye had returned to SpaceX for evaluation. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon-9 launch vehicle and Dragon were both under contract to NASA to provide cargo resupply to the ISS, following the Space Shuttle\u2019s retirement.

Some American association with the Chinese Army is essential to stabilizing relations with China. High-level meetings, officer exchange programs and other links can reduce tensions and mistrust. But while China is not an enemy, it is not an ally either, and caution is required to insure that sensitive American military technology is not transferred.

        "story": "Images released at the American Geophysical Union meeting in Boston showed what scientists believed was the first evidence of ice on Mars outside of the planet\u2019s polar ice caps. The images showed a 30-mile-wide (48-kilometer-wide) crater containing a discolored area measuring about 12 to 18 miles (19 to 29 kilometers) across the bottom of the crater. Some scientists thought the discoloration indicated the presence of some sort of deposit, possibly frozen mud or sand, evidence that ice is present, or was present in the past. Others offered a different theory about the contents of the images: volcanic activity could explain the apparent deposit in the crater. The images, from Mars Global Surveyor, had 10 to 12 times better resolution than any previous image of the crater. Arizona State University researchers made another announcement regarding Surveyor\u2019s data; the Arizona researchers believed that a \u201cconcentration of a rust-colored mineral along the Mars equator indicates it once had boiling hydrothermal vents and perhaps huge lakes.\u201d The mineral, hematite, was the first clear evidence of widespread thermal activity on Mars. NASA officials added that the finding indicated that water \u201cwas once stable at or near the surface and that Mars had a thicker atmosphere in its early history, probably 4 billion to 6 billion years ago.\u201d(Sharon L. Lynch for Associated Press, \u201cMars Discovery,\u201d 28 May 1998; Washington Times, \u201cMinerals Suggest Life in Mars\u2019 Past: Scientists Eye Water Signs for Answers,\u201d 28 May 1998.)",

        "story": "Scientists announced an estimate of the universe\u2019s age based on new HST images of very faint white dwarf stars in Messier 4 (M4), a cluster of stars in the constellation Scorpius. The researchers had closely examined M4\u2019s white dwarf starslow-mass stars that have exhausted their fuel sources for thermonuclear fusion. Although white dwarfs cool at a predictable rate, enabling scientists to estimate their age, they become progressively fainter as they cool, making them difficult to observe. The HST had provided the first deep exposures of these dim stars, which the astronomers discovered were M4\u2019s oldest white dwarf stars, at around 12 to 13 billion years old. Earlier Hubble observations had revealed that the first stars in the universe had formed less than 1 billion years after the universe\u2019s emergence from the Big Bang. Thus, the researchers had discovered that the age of these M4 white dwarfs supported the previous estimates that the universe\u2019s age is 13 to 14 billion years old. The use of this new methodology to estimate the universe\u2019s age represented a major departure from those used previously.(NASA, \u201cHubble Uncovers Oldest \u2018Clocks\u2019 in Space To Read Age of Universe,\u201d news release 02-73, 24 April 2004; Brad M.

Brown of the California Institute of Technology had led a team of scientists to discover a small body of rock and ice located 8 billion miles (13 billion kilometers) from Earth. They had named the object Sedna after the Inuit goddess of the ocean. Sedna was the largest object found in the solar system since Pluto\u2019s discovery in 1930. However, astronomers reported that they could not designate Sedna as a planet because, like Pluto, Sedna is too smallwith an estimated diameter of 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers)and possesses an irregular orbit. The scientists stated that the discovery might also have been the first observation of a region called the Oort Cloud, which is located outside of Pluto\u2019s orbit. Astronomers had long hypothesized the existence of this region of small frozen objects, the source of comets that enter Earth\u2019s solar system. The team had discovered Sedna using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the California Institute of Technology\u2019s Palomar Observatory.(NASA, \u201cMost Distant Object in Solar System Discovered,\u201d news release 04-091, 15 March 2009; Thomas H.

        "story": "NASA announced that it had approved the extension of operations for the twin Mars Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, for up to 18 months. The robotic craft had already surprised engineers and scientists, having completed 11 months of extended activity beyond their successful three- month primary missions. Opportunity had driven more than three miles since arriving at Mars, eight times the distance originally planned, and, in March 2005, had set a new record of 722 feet (220 meters) in a single day\u2019s drive. Spirit had driven a shorter distance but was working in a much rougher terrain than Opportunity. Both rovers were exhibiting signs of wear and exposure, and scientists recognized that either mission could end suddenly because of a random part failure. James K. Erickson, Project Manager for the rovers at NASA\u2019s JPL, remarked that, despite the wear and the effects of exposure, both rovers remained in exceptional shape. Erickson said that NASA would work to get as much benefit as possible for as long as the craft were capable of producing worthwhile scientific results. Director of NASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Program J. Douglas McCuistion added that the rovers\u2019 successes had strengthened NASA\u2019s commitment to achieving the ambitious goals of returning samples from Mars and eventually sending a human expedition to the planet.(NASA, \u201cDurable Mars Rovers Sent into Third Overtime Period,\u201d news release 05-091, 6 April 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/apr/HQ_05091_mer_extension.html (accessed 29 June 2009).)",

NASA had scheduled Cassini\u2019s launch for early October 1997. NASA officials delayed the launch until they could complete further tests, offering no immediate estimate of how long that might take. Interested scientists and engineers, however, predicted that the problem could postpone the mission by months or even years. Under the mission\u2019s original timetable, NASA had expected Cassini to launch in October 1997, reaching Saturn in July 2004. Because of the length of the journey from Earth to Saturn, the scientific community expected that NASA would find it difficult to reschedule the flight. Moreover, experts warned that the alignment of planets providing an ideal launch date, such as that in October 1997, would not occur again for 12 to 14 years. At US$3.2 billion, Cassini was one of the last of NASA\u2019s high- stake, multibillion-dollar missions, drawing considerable attention during the climate of steady cost reductions that characterized the 1990s.(NASA, \u201cCountdown Test Reveals Fuel Leaks on Cassini Mission Centaur Upper Stage,\u201d 7 August 1997; Associated Press, \u201cRocket Leak Could Postpone Landing on Saturn by Years,\u201d 8 August 1997.)",

        "story": "Observations from the HST revealed the existence of medium-sized black holes. According to scientists, the discovery provided important information about the creation of many types of celestial bodies. Scientists were surprised to find that the black holes in the cores of globular star clusters\u2015bright clusters of stars that orbit galaxies, including the Milky Way\u2015are nearly 10,000 times less massive than galaxies. The HST data revealed that black holes in globular star clusters are proportionally smaller than massive black holes found in galaxies, demonstrating that the mass of a black hole is proportional to its stellar surroundings. The results also indicated that when the globular star clusters had formed they had black holes, suggesting that, to form large star clusters, black holes must act as gravitational anchors. Scientists believed these findings might illuminate the process by which galaxies and globular clusters formed. The discovery also suggested that black holes are more ubiquitous than scientists had previously thought.(NASA, \u201cHubble Discovers Black Holes in Unexpected Places,\u201d news release 02-174, 17 September 2002; William Harwood, \u201cFinding May Connect Dots on How Galaxies Form; Mid-size Black Holes Are Discovered,\u201d Washington Post, 18 September 2002.)",

Tito as a member of the Russian crew that would travel aboard the Soyuz to the ISS on 30 April. Space enthusiast Dennis Tito had paid the cash-strapped Russian Space Agency a reported US$20 million to make the trip. Russia\u2019s agreement with the untrained Tito had sparked debate over the proper use of the ISS and over so-called space tourism. Talgat A. Musabayev, the Kazakh cosmonaut who was to command Tito\u2019s crew, removed his men from the training program in Houston after learning that NASA would not allow Tito to participate in the exercises. NASA argued that allowing a person who had not trained as an astronaut to travel to space would pose safety risks, especially since the ISS remained a work-in-progress. Russian officials contended that they had the right to transport aboard their spacecraft any person they deemed fit for the mission. Both sides pledged to find a resolution to the disagreement.(Kathy Sawyer, \u201cSpace Tourism Sparks U.S.-Russian Standoff,\u201d Washington Post, 20 March 2001; Warren E.

In the inaugural launch in August 1998 of a Boeing Delta III, a rocket designed to carry twice the payload of the Delta II, the rocket had exploded in midair. In this second attempt at flight, the rocket had survived the initial launch, but malfunctioned when the second stage failed to ignite properly, leaving Orion in an orbit lower than planned. Engineers were uncertain whether it would be possible to boost the satellite using on-board fuel and thrusters.(Marcia Dunn for Associated Press, \u201cNew Boeing Rocket Malfunctions, Satellite Enters Wrong Orbit,\u201d 5 May 1999.)",

        "story": "The journal Science published a special issue about water on Mars. The issue included five reports that had used the scientific results derived from the detailed images that NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) had captured during the first 100 days of its mission. MRO\u2019s primary mission was to study Mars\u2019s hydrologic history, using six scientific instruments, including the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera (HiRISE), which provided 10 times the resolution of any previous Mars imager. The papers published in this special issue of Science indicated that evidence for liquid water on Mars was rare and difficult to discern. NASA\u2019s Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), which had visited Mars in 1999, had raised researchers\u2019 hopes that the probe had detected modern flows of liquid water on Mars. However, MRO\u2019s observations suggested otherwise\u2014that landslides of loose, dry materials had created the deposits that scientists had interpreted as evidence of liquid water. In addition, MRO had captured images suggesting that flowing lava, rather than water, had shaped some Martian landforms, such as branched channels and fan-like deposits. Moreover, MRO images indicated that, although certain gullies and rims of craters did indeed contain liquid water, the presence of water at these locations did not reveal the presence of a water table. Rather, the images suggested that objects impacting Mars had triggered trickles of water at these sites. Radar and gravity data indicated that the cap on Mars\u2019s south pole held the largest reservoir of water ice on the planet.(NASA, \u201cNASA Orbiter Provides Insights About Mars Water and Climate,\u201d news release 07-206, 20 September 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/sep/HQ_07206_Mars_Water.html (accessed 4 August 2010); Joanne Baker, \u201cIntroduction to Special Issue: Water, Water, Not Everywhere?\u201d Science 317, no. 5845 (21 September 2007): 1705, http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/sci;317/5845/1705?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULT FORMAT=&fulltext=Mars+Reconnaissance+Orbiter&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&resourcetype=HWCIT (DOI: 10.1126/science.317.5845.1705; accessed 10 August 2010); Jeanna Bryner, \u201cHope for Water on Mars Dims with Sharp New Images,\u201d Space.com, 20 September 2007, http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070920_mars_tale. html (accessed 10 August 2010).)",

        "story": "Robert C. Seamans Jr., who had served as NASA Deputy Administrator during the Apollo era, died of heart failure at age 89. Seamans had begun his career as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1940s. In 1960 he had accepted a position with NASA as Associate Administrator, and, from 1965 to 1968, he had served as Deputy Administrator. During his tenure, NASA had worked to achieve President John F. Kennedy\u2019s goal of landing a man on the Moon, and Seamans had been instrumental to the success of that mission. In 1968 Seamans had left his position at NASA to return to MIT, although he remained a consultant to NASA\u2019s Administrator. Later that year, he had assisted in making the controversial decision to send Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon, a move that had laid the groundwork for the lunar landing. Seamans had served as Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from 1969 to 1973. In 1974 he had been appointed Administrator of the Energy, Research and Development Administration, a predecessor agency to the Department of Energy. In 1977 Seamans had accepted a position as Dean of the School of Engineering at MIT, where he had continued to teach aeronautics classes even after his formal retirement in 1984.(Peter Schworm, \u201cRobert Seamans; Helped Lead NASA During Apollo Missions,\u201d Boston Globe, 30 June 2008. 79 NASA, \u201cAstronaut James Reilly Leaves NASA,\u201d news release 08-162, 30 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/ hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08163_Seamans_statement.html (accessed 21 April 2011).)",

Stephenson, in preparation for his planned January 2004 retirement from NASA. King had been MSFC\u2019s Deputy Director since November 2002, assisting Stephenson in managing a range of propulsion, space science, and materials research, as well as development work. NASA had also dispatched King to Lufkin, Texas, within hours of the Columbia disaster, to serve as the senior on-site NASA official in the search-and-recovery effort. In that capacity, he had created critical, initial work processes; established effective working relationships among federal and state government agencies; and set the foundation for the two subsequent NASA officials who would share responsibility for leading effective recovery efforts. Before serving as Deputy Director of MSFC, King had been Deputy Director of Shuttle Processing, Launch Director of six Shuttle missions, and Director of Shuttle Processing at NASA\u2019s KSC. As Director of Shuttle Processing at KSC, he had managed and coordinated all Space Shuttle processing, launch, and landing operations and had made the final determination to launch during the three-day countdown process.(NASA, \u201cDavid A.

        "story": "The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on the threat of space debris to the planned International Space Station (ISS). According to the report, Space Surveillance: DOD and NASA Need Consolidated Requirements and a Coordinated Plan, NASA\u2019s surveillance capabilities, relying on the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) network of radar and optical sensors for information about possible collisions, had not provided enough information to prevent collisions in space. GAO surmised that DOD had focused most of its attention on military objects, missing many of the smaller pieces of debris that could have caused significant damage to NASA\u2019s Shuttles or the ISS. GAO recommended that NASA, DOD, and the CIA collaborate to upgrade the space surveillance system. According to estimates, more than 110,000 pieces of debris, most measuring about 0.5 inches (1.3 centimeters) in diameter, were floating in space. With a closing velocity of 35,000 miles (56,000 kilometers) per hour, even such a small object would do significant damage to the ISS, when the station was in a prograde orbit. GAO\u2019s report noted that the fully completed ISS would be 10 times larger than any Shuttle flying in space, and that it would be in orbit for at least 10 years, increasing the chance of a collision occurring. Although they acknowledged the possibility of a collision, NASA scientists argued that the odds favored the ISS\u2019s avoiding such an occurrence. As NASA\u2019s expert, Chief Scientist for Orbital Debris, Nicholas L. Johnson, explained, \u201cThe odds are certainly in your favor that nothing will happen at all in those 10 years [of planned space station operation].\u201d(U.S. General Accounting Office, \u201cSpace Surveillance: DOD and NASA Need Consolidated Requirements and a Coordinated Plan\u201d (report no.

The 3.8-ton (3,500- kilogram or 3.5-tonne) AsiaSat 3 had remained stranded in a useless orbit since its December 1997 launch. Asia Satellite Telecommunications had received US$200 million from insurers. The insurers had told Hughes Global Services to find a new customer, if the salvage mission was successful. Asia Satellite Telecommunications had originally intended AsiaSat 3 to provide television and telephone service in Asia, but the Russian-built launcher had malfunctioned, and the satellite\u2019s orbit had gone awry, rendering it useless. Hughes Global Services had taken possession of the satellite, implementing a \u201cseemingly improbable\u201d mission to salvage the spacecraft. Hughes had sent the satellite around the Moon twice, using the Moon\u2019s gravity to help correct the satellite\u2019s orbit around the Earth, and declared the salvage mission a success, even though the satellite was not stationary, which would limit the number of customers who might lease or buy it.(Andrew Pollack for Associated Press, \u201cRescue Effort Puts a Satellite in Viable Orbit,\u201d New York Times, 19 June 1998; Associated Press, \u201cUS Satellites,\u201d 19 June 1998.)",

SMART-1 was the first spacecraft since NASA\u2019s 1998 Lunar Prospector to attempt the journey to the Moon. ESA planned for the 770-pound (349.2-kilogram) craft, powered by an ion- propulsion engine, to reach the Moon in early 2005. SMART-1 carried 33 pounds (15 kilograms) of miniature instruments, which researchers from Finland, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom had provided, including a color camera the size of a human eye, a 4.4- pound (2-kilogram) infrared spectrometer, and an 11-pound (5-kilogram) x-ray spectrometer. The purpose of the SMART-1 mission was to solve certain mysteries about the Moon\u2019s formation, its mineralogical composition, and the amount of water it has, if any. The Ariane 5 also carried into orbit two telecommunications satellites\u2015the INSAT 3-E for India and the European e-BIRD. ESA had delayed the launch of e-BIRD since 28 August to allow the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to make further checks on its satellite.(Frank D.

What few probably realize is that there are thousands of other space objects that could hit us in the next century that could cause severe damage, if not total destruction. Last week two events in Washington -- a conference on ''planetary defense'' held by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the release by NASA of a report titled ''Near-Earth Object Survey and Deflection Analysis of Alternatives'' -- gave us good news and bad on this front. On the promising side, scientists have a good grasp of the risks of a cosmic fender-bender, and have several ideas that could potentially stave off disaster. Unfortunately, the government doesn't seem to have any clear plan to put this expertise into action.",

In conducting the review of Orion\u2019s requirements data set, NASA scientists and engineers had discussed more than 1,700 topics, covering all aspects of Orion\u2019s performance, design, and qualifications. The SRR would provide a baseline for the design, development, construction, and safe operation of the spacecraft that NASA would use to carry astronauts beyond Earth orbit. In November 2006, NASA had completed an overall review of requirements for the Constellation Program, which also included the Ares launch vehicles and systems for the human exploration of planetary surfaces.(NASA, \u201cNASA Completes Key Review of Orion Spacecraft,\u201d news release 07-58, 7 March 2007, http://www. nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/mar/HQ_07058_Orion_SRR.html (accessed October 14, 2009); Jefferson Morris, \u201cBaseline Requirements Completed by NASA for Orion,\u201d Aviation Week, 9 March 2007; \u201cNASA\u2019s Orion Spacecraft One Step Closer to Assembly,\u201d Aero-News Network, 9 March 2007.)",

        "story": "ESA\u2019s YES2 craft attempted to deliver Fotino, a 12-pound (5.4-kilogram) reentry capsule, to a landing site in Kazakhstan, via an experimental tether system. YES2 deployed Fotino from the Foton-M3 spacecraft. A metal brace and straps held Fotino in place while the tether unwound, gradually lowering the capsule. The mission plan called for the tether to lower the capsule 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) below Foton-M3. However, a malfunction prevented the tether from unreeling to its full length. Telemetry data indicated that the tether had deployed approximately 8.5 kilometers (5.3 miles). Automated timers aboard the craft commanded Fotino to separate approximately a half hour before the scheduled touchdown time, even though the tether had not extended fully. However, because the tether had not completely deployed before Fotino\u2019s release, early estimates predicted that the reentry vehicle would orbit for 4\u201311 days before reentering the atmosphere. Lead Engineer for the YES2 mission Â. Michiel Kruijiff remarked that, apart from the problem with the tether, the mission had been largely successful, achieving many of the mission objectives.(Stephen Clark, \u201cSpace Tether Experiment Hits Major Snag,\u201d Spaceflight Now, 26 September 2007; Vladimir Isachenkov for Associated Press, \u201cRussian Attempt To Deliver Parcel from Space Fails,\u201d 26 September 2007.)",

According to the mission plan, SELENE would place its main orbiter Kayuga in an orbit approximately 60 miles (96.6 kilometers) from the Moon and would then deploy two smaller satellites in polar orbits. The project constituted a key advance for Japan, which had launched its first satellite in 1972 but, since that time, had struggled to keep up with the People\u2019s Republic of China. Japan had launched SELENE on 14 September, following a four-year delay of the mission.(Eric Talmadge for Associated Press, \u201cJapan\u2019s SELENE Probe Reaches Lunar Orbit,\u201d 5 October 2007.)",

Rocketplane Kistler had missed fund-raising milestones, said Alan Lindenmoyer, manager of NASA's commercial crew and cargo program office. George French Sr., chief executive of Rocketplane Kistler, expressed disappointment, but said, ''I am very proud of the technical progress our superb team has made over the last year.''

The announcement followed NASA\u2019s decision to terminate its agreement with Rocketplane Kistler of Oklahoma City, which had failed to meet requisite milestones toward developing and demonstrating commercial transportation capabilities to low Earth orbit. According to the COTS agreements, companies participating in the competition would receive seed money upon reaching specific performance milestones. NASA had selected two companies in 2006\u2014Rocketplane Kistler and SpaceX of El Segundo, California\u2014to receive COTS funding. Both companies had signed Space Act Agreements detailing mutually agreed financial and technical milestones and a payment schedule based on those requirements. Rocketplane Kistler had missed its fourth milestone in May\u2014a second round of private financing. In early September, NASA had officially notified Rocketplane Kistler that the company had failed to perform, leading to the termination process. Unable to attract US$500 million in private investment, Rocketplane Kistler had expended its funds and had stopped nearly all its technical work by the end of July. NASA had disbursed to Rocketplane Kistler US$32.1 million out of the US$206.8 million that it had agreed to invest in the company. NASA would make the remaining US$174.7 million available to other aerospace firms in the new competition.(NASA, \u201cNASA To Open New Competition for Space Transportation Seed Money,\u201d news release 07-228, 18 October 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/oct/HQ_07228_COTS_competition.html (accessed 8 September 2010); Patrick Peterson, \u201cRPK out of COTS Race,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 19 October 2007. 153 Sergei Ponomarev for Associated Press, \u201cSoyuz Craft Lands Short of Destination,\u201d 22 October 2007.)",

The X-43A contained an experimental engine\u2015called a supersonic combustion ramjet or scramjet. The scramjet engine had no moving parts and did not use fuel from an on-board tank, as is the case with rockets. Instead, the engine used oxygen from the atmosphere, passing through the vehicle, to ignite fuel. NASA had explored the use of scramjets as an alternative to rocket power for space-access vehicles, with the hope that scramjet vehicles would operate more like an airplane than a rocket. The mission lifted off from NASA\u2019s DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 2:30 p.m. (PST). A NASA B-52 carried the unpiloted X-43A to an altitude of 40,000 feet (7.6 miles or 12.2 kilometers). Before the X-43A had attained at an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers), a Pegasus rocket booster launched from the B-52, providing an initial acceleration that enabled the X-43A to attain an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers). The experimental aircraft flew for nearly 10 seconds at that altitude before descending into the Pacific Ocean as planned, nearly 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) off the coast of California.(John Johnson, \u201cX-43A Aircraft Sets Speed Record at 6,500 MPH,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 17 November 2004; NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s X-43A Scramjet Breaks Speed Record,\u201d news release 04-373, 16 November 2004.)",

Grunsfeld successfully replaced all six of HST\u2019s gyroscopes and had \u201cjust enough time to equip each of the telescope\u2019s six batteries with a voltage regulator to prevent overheating.\u201d NASA believed corroded wires had caused the gyroscope failures. To avoid repeating the failure, engineers used pressurized nitrogen rather than air to force fluid into the new gyroscopes. Smith and Grunsfeld alternated working inside the tight space housing the gyroscopes. Because of his long arms, NASA assigned the 6-foot-3.5-inch-tall (1.9-meter-tall) Smith, who had worked on HST during its last service call in 1997, the task of replacing the two sets of gyroscopes on the sides, which were more difficult to reach. The spacewalk lasted 2 hours longer than scheduled. Although Smith and Grunsfeld went to work an hour early and quickly organizing their tools in the cargo bay, the pair needed extra time to open coolant-line valves on a disabled infrared camera and encountered difficulty latching the doors of the cargo bay holding the equipment.(Marcia Dunn for the Associated Press, \u201cHubble Gets a Transplant: Initial Check Says New Parts Are Working,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 23 December 1999, Associated Press, \u201cCrew Replaces All 6 Hubble Gyroscopes,\u201d Washington Times, 23 December 1999.)",

The members of Expedition 2\u2015Russian cosmonaut Yury V. Usachev and NASA astronauts James S. Voss and Susan J. Helms\u2015would replace the first ISS research team. The transfer also entailed a change of command aboard the orbiting research center. American William M. Shepherd, Commander during the first research period, had led a crew of two Russian cosmonauts in installing and calibrating ISS equipment. With many of the initial installation problems resolved, the second crew planned to devote more time to research. The Russian cosmonaut who was to take command aboard the ISS had plenty of space experience. Commander Usachev had spent 376 days on Mir and had performed numerous spacewalks. Although Voss and Helms had both flown on Shuttle missions before, this voyage was their first time traveling to space for a significant research period. The primary purpose of the Shuttle\u2019s 14-day mission was to deliver the new crew, but Discovery also carried, for the first time, the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM).

The launch itself took place at the \u201cexact moment on the exact day as planned\u201d for the sixth consecutive mission. The six-person crew included Takao Doi, a Japanese astronaut who planned to make his country\u2019s first spacewalk; Kalpana Chawla, the first Indian-born woman to travel into space; Leonid K. Kadenyuk, the first Ukrainian to fly on a U.S. Shuttle; and U.S. astronauts Kevin R. Kregel, Steven W. Lindsey, and Winston E. Scott. The crew planned to conduct a spacewalk to test instruments and procedures for the ISS. The Shuttle also carried the U.S. Microgravity Payload-4, which the astronauts planned to use to test the responses to conditions in space of a variety of materials and liquids.(NASA, \u201cSolar and Microgravity Research Highlight Final Shuttle Mission of 1997,\u201d news release J97037, November 1997; William Harwood, \u201cColumbia Corkscrews into Orbit,\u201d Washington Post, 20 November 1997; Reuters, \u201cU.S. Shuttle Blasts Off with Multinational Crew,\u201d 19 November 1997; Associated Press, \u201cShuttle Executes Flip on Its Way into Orbit,\u201d 16 November 1997.)",

The discovery of the three planets orbiting the Sun-like star HD 69830, which is approximately 41 light-years from Earth, marked the first time that astronomers had identified a system composed of several planets, each planet possessing a mass approximating that of Neptune. Theoretical calculations of the complexion of the three planets had indicated that the two closest to HD 69830 have a rocky composition similar to the planet Mercury. The astronomers reported that the outermost planet likely has a significant gaseous envelope, surrounding a core composed of rock or ice or a combination of the two, and that the temperatures of the planet are moderate enough to allow the existence of liquid water. The team had discovered the planets using the European Southern Observatory\u2019s 3.6-meter (11.8-foot) telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The telescope was equipped with a precise spectrograph to detect small wobbles induced by the Puppis planets in the HD 69830 star. The technique of detecting and studying these wobbles enabled astronomers to measure the 64 gravitational influence of a planet on its parent star and, thereby, to infer the planet\u2019s presence.",

        "story": "NASA, conducting a test over the Pacific Ocean, aborted a planned attempt at the speed record for aircraft when the Pegasus rocket carrying a prototype X-43A jet veered out of control. NASA had employed a B-52 to carry the X-43A and the Pegasus rocket to 45,000 feet, where the test was to begin. According to the plan, the plane would release the Pegasus, which would then carry the X-43A to 100,000 feet (30,500 meters) before releasing the jet. Instead, however, the Pegasus rocket had gone out of control almost immediately after its release. NASA spokesperson Alan Brown explained: \u201cThe Pegasus went out of control. It appeared parts were breaking off of it.\u201d NASA ordered the Pegasus destroyed after only a few seconds, and the ensuing explosion resulted in the loss of the scramjet as well. NASA officials and flight enthusiasts had hoped that the US$185 million experimental plane would top speeds of Mach 7. Instead, engineers scrambled to determine the cause of the accident.(Peter Pae, \u201cHypersonic Aircraft Test Fails; Plane Is Destroyed,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 3 June 2001; New York Times, \u201cNASA Halts Scramjet Test,\u201d 3 June 2001; Washington Post, \u201cNASA Aborts Bid for Speed Mark, Blows Up Rocket,\u201d 3 June 2001.)",

Too bad the program that yielded these pioneering discoveries was reined in not long ago so that NASA could pour billions of dollars into resuming shuttle flights, finishing the international space station, and developing spacecraft to pursue the Bush administration's ambitious space exploration program. The research that won this year's Nobel Prize in Physics was performed using instruments aboard the Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989. Huge teams of government and academic researchers measured and analyzed the cosmic microwave background radiation that permeates the universe. Their findings provided strong support for the Big Bang theory of the origins of the universe, and turned cosmology, previously rather speculative, into a precise science. The discoveries have been hailed as one of the greatest scientific advances of the past century.",

        "story": "In an article in the journal Nature, astronomers at ESA reported that they had found evidence indicating which specific type of stellar object produces gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the universe\u2019s most energetic phenomena. Prevailing hypotheses had posited that, either GRBs originate from the merger of two neutron stars, or they form from the collapse of one massive star, but researchers had discovered no conclusive proof to support either of these ideas. However, based on their analysis of the speed, temperature, and chemical elements of a GRB that had occurred on 11 December 2001, ESA astronomers found evidence supporting the latter hypothesis. The research team examined two sequential observations of the GRB, both taken by ESA satellites: the BeppoSAX satellite had made the first observation, and, nearly 11 hours later, the XMM-Newton satellite had made the second. The team had found large quantities of argon, calcium, magnesium, silicon, and sulphur, moving at 1/10th the speed of light. These findings supported the idea that a supernova explosion from a single massive star produces GRBs. If the merger of two neutron stars had produced the burst, astronomers would have expected the stars to produce large amounts of elements other than those observed\u2015particularly iron\u2015and to emit those elements at a slower velocity.(J.

Reeves et al., \u201cThe Signature of Supernova Ejecta in the X-ray Afterglow of the γ-ray Burst 011211,\u201d Nature 416, no. 6880 (4 April 2002): 512\u2013515; ESA, \u201cESA\u2019s X-ray Space Telescope Proves Supernovae Can Cause Mysterious Gamma-Ray Bursts,\u201d ESA news release 22-2002, 4 April 2002.)",

Dailey, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), Associate Deputy Administrator of NASA, as Director of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum, effective January 2000. Dailey succeeded Vice Admiral Donald D. Engen, U.S. Navy (Retired), who had died suddenly in a glider accident in July after serving as the museum\u2019s director for three years. Dailey had begun work at NASA in 1992, after retiring from 36 years of highly decorated service in the U.S. Marine Corps. NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin remarked that Dailey\u2019s leadership at NASA had been unparalleled, and that he had \u201cshaped and strengthened the [A]gency, and was responsible for developing an infrastructure that [would] carry NASA into the new millennium.\u201d Secretary Heyman commented on Dailey\u2019s selection from a strong field of candidates, describing him as \u201ca most impressive individual,\u201d who had earned confidence and admiration throughout the air and space community and would continue the strong, dedicated leadership expected at the museum. In addition to managing 260 employees and a US$25 million budget, Dailey\u2019s appointment placed him in charge of construction of the museum\u2019s new 710,000-square-foot (66,000-square-meter), hangar-style facility, expected to open at Dulles International Airport in December 2003. The Smithsonian had conceived the idea of the new facility to display its vast aeronautics and space holdings; the original National Air and Space Museum building was too small to house the additional collection of more than 180 aircraft and 100 spacecraft.(Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, \u201cNew Director of the National Air and Space Museum To Take Office in January,\u201d news release, 24 November 1999, http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroom/releaseDetail.cfm? releaseID=97 (accessed 19 March 2008); Peter Carlson, \u201cNew Air & Space Chief: General Succeeds Director Killed in Crash,\u201d Washington Post, 24 November 1999.)",

Frame draggingthe distortion of space and time around rotating celestial bodies, such as Earthoccurs because the gravity of those objects pulls space and time along with them. Ignazio Ciufolini of the University of Lecce in Italy and NASA scientist Erricos C. Pavlis of GSFC had measured distortions in the orbits of the Laser Geodynamics Satellites, LAGEOS and LAGEOS2, to obtain the evidence of frame dragging. They had discovered that, although irregularities in Earth\u2019s surface account for some of the variation in the satellites\u2019 orbits, the remainder of the variation is the effect of space-time distortions.(NASA, \u201cAs the World Turns, It Drags Space and Time,\u201d news release 04-351, 21 October 2004; Guy Gugliotta, \u201cTheory of Relativity Evidence Found,\u201d Washington Post, 22 October 2004.)",

Now C. elegans has achieved another spectacular feat. Hundreds of the worms were on the space shuttle Columbia when it disintegrated. They survived the breakup, the fiery descent through the atmosphere and the jarring collision with the ground and kept on reproducing until they were found three months later.",

Goldin announced that, if Russia did not meet a July 2000 deadline, the United States would provide a substitute module. Russia was already more than two years behind schedule, affecting the ISS\u2019s timeline and hampering the cooperative international effort. Goldin\u2019s decision followed Russia\u2019s announcement of its plan to direct more resources to the failing Mir space station. Some space experts perceived Russia\u2019s designation of scarce financial funds to Mir, rather than to the ISS, as a signal of Russia\u2019s reluctance to participate fully in the international space consortium. In his strongest criticism to date, Goldin said of Russia\u2019s ISS involvement: \u201cTo say we are frustrated and disappointed is an understatement . . . We want the Russians to be there, but we felt we had to be responsible custodians to keep the program on track.\u201d(Warren E.

Delta\u2019s RL10B-2, upper- stage engine was similar to the RL10A-4 used on Atlas\u2019s Centaur upper stage. The Boeing Company and Pratt & Whitney had led the investigation of the Delta III launch failure, with the support of Lockheed Martin. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin Astronautics had formed two panels \u201cto ensure that no aspects of commonality between the RL10 engine versions were overlooked.\u201d The Senior Engineering Review Panel and the Senior Management Review Team had addressed potential causes of launch failure identified in the Delta III investigation, ruling out those factors that did not apply to Atlas flights. When the investigators had determined that \u201can engine- brazing process that left voids in combustion chamber structural jacket splice joints\u201d was common to all RL10 engines, Lockheed Martin had instituted a new set of inspection and analysis measures for accepting or rejecting each engine. Lockheed Martin intended to use the inspection techniques on new production chambers; Pratt & Whitney planned to continue using its standard procedure, with its Flight Certification Board certifying each set of RL10 engines for all Atlas missions.(Lockheed Martin, \u201cLockheed Martin\u2019s Centaur RL10 Engines Cleared for Flight,\u201d news release, 30 August 1999,)",

The Independent Assessment Team on Mission Success, which Lockheed Martin had commissioned in May 1999 after a series of Titan IV launch failures, met its 1 September deadline, reporting its findings and recommendations to Lockheed\u2019s senior management. Lockheed Martin had tasked the investigating team with assessing program management, engineering and manufacturing processes, and quality-control procedures within the company\u2019s Space and Strategic Missiles Sector. Having discovered problems in accountability, quality, subcontract and supplier management, and cost emphasis, the Team recommended that the company develop a \u201cfly-out plan\u201d for Titan IV\u2019s remaining missions, improve its quality control, and improve its management of suppliers and subcontractors.

The two astronauts also inspected the first solar panel that they had unfurled, to determine whether the crew could correct its tension. Wearing a small TV camera on his helmet, Noriega beamed down to Mission Control images of the loose tension cables on the array\u2019s right wing. The cables had slipped off their pulleys during the solar panel\u2019s deployment on 3 December. Tanner remarked that an astronaut could place one tension cable back on its pulley without too much trouble, but that the other cable would require more work. Mission Control instructed the spacewalkers to try to fix the cables on their third and final spacewalk the following day.(Chicago Tribune, \u201cSpace Station Gets an Electrical Boost from Solar Wings,\u201d 6 December 2000; Associated Press, \u201cLive from Space, \u2018Carlos Cam\u2019,\u201d Newsday (Long Island, NY), 6 December 2000.)",
