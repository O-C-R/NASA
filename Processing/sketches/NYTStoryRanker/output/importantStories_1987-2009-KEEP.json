        "story": "After months of debate over whether Russia should bring Mir out of orbit and what damage the space station might cause when it fell to Earth, the 15-year-old Mir space station plunged into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, spraying some of its remnants into the Pacific Ocean. The splashdown marked the end of a 2.2 billion-mile journey for Mir. Witnesses in Fiji reported seeing streaks of gold and silver lights across the sky when Mir fell, but nobody reported any damage from pieces of the falling space station. U.S. officials at the Pentagon tracked the descent, while Japan\u2019s public safety chief urged people to stay indoors to avoid falling debris. Anatoly Y. Solovyev, a Russian cosmonaut who had spent 651 days aboard Mir, remarked that he was sad to see the end of the pathbreaking space station: \u201cAn entire era of our Soviet space program is ending, into which we invested not only our money, but what is more important, our intellectual potential.\u201d Once Mir had descended safely, officials of the Russian Space Agency praised the precise sequence of maneuvers that had brought the space station safely from orbit.(Patrick E.

        "story": "At a NASA news conference, astronomers discussed the discovery of the largest explosion ever sighted in space. The journal Nature published three papers about the event, detected on 14 December 1997. The explosion, a gamma-ray burst (GRB) designated GRB971214, had occurred 12 billion years ago and had \u201capparently outshone all the rest of the universe\u201d for about 40 seconds. The Italian-Dutch orbiting gamma-ray observatory BeppoSAX had measured the sharp pulse of gamma rays and \u201cpinpointed the position of the rays\u2019 source.\u201d The United States\u2019 Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite had also detected the gamma-ray pulse, and scientific institutions around the world had monitored the after-effects of the explosion. Twelve hours afterward, John R. Thorstensen of Dartmouth College had used a 94-inch-diameter (49- centimeter-diameter) telescope at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona to detect a visible afterglow, which lasted for about two weeks. After the glow had faded, the scientists had discovered a faint galaxy in the same location. A team of American, Italian, and Indian astronomers, led by two California Institute of Technology scientists, used the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii to measure the distance from Earth to the source of the burst. No theorists were able to explain the explosion, and no existing models explaining GRBs could explain the amount of energy emitted from GRB971214. The scientists suggested the possibility that a superdense neutron star had ripped apart as it disappeared into a neighboring black hole, or that a violent merger of two black holes had caused the burst.(Malcolm W. Browne, \u201cAstronomers Detect Immense Explosion 2d Only to Big Bang,\u201d New York Times, 7 May 1998; NASA, \u201cMost Powerful Explosion since the Big Bang Challenges Gamma Ray Burst Theories,\u201d news release 98-75, 6 May 1998.)",

The team of the Balloon Observation of Millimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics (BOOMERANG) project had gathered the data from a telescope aboard a balloon, which circumnavigated Antarctica at an altitude of 23 miles (37 kilometers). According to Team Leader Paolo deBernardis, the beginning of the universe left behind a residue of light and sound, providing scientists with hints about the details of the Big Bang: \u201cThe early universe is full of sound waves compressing and rarefying matter and light, much like sound waves compress and rarefy air inside a flute or trumpet.\u201d The BOOMERANG team\u2019s findings provided a new means of examining the early universe and new evidence to use in calculating how it changed.

        "story": "Scientists announced the discovery of frozen water on the Moon, calling into question the long- held belief that the Moon lacked any form of hydration. The Clementine spacecraft had found the ice while using radar signals to examine the depths of the Moon\u2019s craters. The discovery was the by-product of a US$75 million mission, co-sponsored by NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense, to test the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d sensors developed to detect and track missiles. The possible ice deposit, composed of the suspected ice crystals mixed with dirt and spread over a vast landscape, was termed a dirty lake. The scientists discovered the ice in a massive, extremely deep crater. One scientist described the crater as twice the size of Puerto Rico and deeper than the height of Mount Everest. Scientists discussing the significance of the discovery postulated that the presence of water on the Moon might be a boon to future space exploration, perhaps enabling the construction of a \u201cfilling station\u201d on the Moon. Other scientists offered a more sober opinion of the findings, referring to reports that the presence of water on the Moon might someday allow for colonization as \u201chyperbole.\u201d(John Noble Wilford, \u201cThe Moon May Have Water, and Many New Possibilities,\u201d New York Times, 4 December 1996; Associated Press, \u201cDeep Within Lunar Crater, Small Frozen Lake Is Found,\u201d 3 December 1996; Joyce Price, \u201cProspect of Ice on Moon Fires Hopes of Scientists,\u201d Washington Times, 4 December 1996; Curt Suplee, \u201cThe Moon\u2019s \u2018Dirty Lake\u2019 Makes Waves,\u201d Washington Post, 4 December 1996.)",

Using an Australian robotic telescope, which measured distances between more than 100,000 galaxies, researchers had charted the locations of galaxies, dark regions, and cosmic clusters. Perhaps most significantly, the new map supported a long-standing theory regarding the size limits of cosmic structures. Because of the relatively small scope of previous mapping surveys, scientists had questioned whether the known standards of cosmic size were representative. The newest map, however, did not reveal any cosmic structure outside of previous standards. Therefore, scientists could support with greater conviction the idea that size limits existed as the universe evolved. The researchers termed the limits the \u201cend of greatness.\u201d(James Glanz, \u201cRobotic Telescope Affirms Assumption on Universe\u2019s Birth,\u201d New York Times, 7 June 2000. 933 Mark Carreau, \u201cRocket Gives Space Station a Life,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 7 June 2000.)",

NEAR was the first spacecraft successfully to orbit an asteroid and to provide detailed data about it. Even in its first year, the NEAR spacecraft had exceeded expectations, gathering 10 times more data than scientists had forecast. Traveling more than 2 billion miles (3.2 billion kilometers), NEAR had captured 11 million laser pulses; x-ray, gamma- ray, and infrared readings; and approximately 160,000 images of Eros. With its initial objectives accomplished, the NEAR team focused on accomplishing another firsta controlled descent of the spacecraft onto the asteroid. Astronomers hoped that the landing would gather close-up images, otherwise impossible to obtain. With the low-cost and efficient spacecraft nearly out of fuel, NEAR Mission Director Robert W. Farquhar explained that NEAR\u2019s landing was a final attempt to glean as much as possible from the endeavor.

A group of scientists led by Rosanne Di Stefano of the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics had examined data collected by NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory. The team had studied x-rays emitted by enigmatic objects located in nearby galaxies, finding that the volume of x-rays emanating from these objects was comparable to or greater than the volume emitted by relatively warmer, larger hard x-ray sources, such as neutron stars and supermassive black holes. The findings indicated that the newly discovered objects could be a type of black hole that the researchers termed \u201cquasi-soft\u201d x-ray sources.(NASA, \u201cEnigmatic X-ray Sources May Point To New Class of Black Holes,\u201d news release 04-067, 1 March 2004; Frank Morring Jr., \u201cIn Orbit,\u201d Aviation Week and Space Technology 160, no. 10 (8 March 2004): 19.)",

As telescopes got bigger over the centuries, capable of gathering and focusing more light, astronomers saw beyond the serenity of the every-night sky to find planets of the Sun the ancients never knew and fields of stars, previously unknown, that seemed to trail off into infinity. The heavens were not a domed ceiling, as once imagined, decorated with twinkling lights in patterns to delight human beings, looking up from the center of it all.",

Farhad Zadeh of Northwestern University had used Chandra to locate \u201ca cauldron of 60 million degree gas enveloping a cluster of young stars.\u201d The discovery marked the first time that scientists had located such high-energy x-rays surrounding young stars. Zadeh also noted that the newly discovered cluster, located some 25,000 light-years from Earth and estimated at 1 to 2 million years old, had provided evidence in support of the theory that stellar winds generated by stars can produce very hot gas. In addition to Zadeh\u2019s find, Andreas Zezas of the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced that his team of scientists had found new midmass black holes in several starburst galaxiesregions where stars form and explode frequently. Researchers had long hypothesized that such an environment might exist but had previously been able to locate only a few midmass black holes. Zezas credited the powerful Chandra X-ray Observatory with allowing astronomers to examine far-flung galaxies more closely than before. Kimberly A. Weaver of NASA\u2019s GSFC, who had contributed to Zezas\u2019s project, hypothesized that the concentration of midsize black holes could possibly lead eventually to the formation of a single, massive black hole.(NASA, \u201cStar Factory near Galactic Center Bathed in High-Energy X-rays,\u201d news release 01-113, 6 June 2001; John Noble Wilford, \u201cHot Stellar Winds Captured by X-ray Orbiter,\u201d New York Times, 12 June 2001; NASA, \u201cChandra Sees Wealth of Black Holes in Star-Forming Galaxies,\u201d news release 01-110, 6 June 2001.)",

Budarin, Bowersox, and Pettit had arrived at the ISS in November 2002 aboard Endeavour, scheduled to return to Earth aboard another Shuttle flight on 11 March. However, the Columbia disaster in February had grounded the remaining three Shuttles in NASA\u2019s fleet, prolonging the crew\u2019s stay aboard the ISS.

Failure to reestablish contact had caused concern for the trio\u2019s welfare.

However, they were unable to find the puncture that space officials believed Mir had sustained. The exercise was only the second joint spacewalk of a U.S. astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut. During the excursion, Foale used a crane to hoist Solovyev toward the damaged region of the craft. The two crew members endured temperatures ranging from 200°F (93°C), when Mir was in the sunlight, to -150°F (-101°C), when it passed into the darkness. Although Foale had spent many hours preparing for the spacewalk, learning how to maneuver in the heavy Russian spacesuit, he still exercised extreme caution to avoid snagging the suit on of Mir\u2019s jagged edges.

NASA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had established the ISS Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task Force to analyze the space station\u2019s cost, budget, and management and to recommend how the numerous space agencies supporting the project could derive maximum benefit from their investment. The Task Force\u2019s report stated that, although the ISS program\u2019s technical achievements to date had been extraordinary, problems concerning the program\u2019s budget, management, and other matters threatened future development of the ISS. In addition, the IMCE Task Force recommended numerous changes to establish a core-complete program for the ISS, including altering program management; identifying and applying additional funding; and implementing more clearly defined programs to build the ISS so that its crew would be able to conduct high-priority research at the space station. With regard to maximizing research under the proposed FY 2002 budget, the Task Force recommended establishing research priorities, implementing a plan to execute them, and allocating more ISS crew time to high-priority research.(NASA, \u201cReport by the International Space Station Management and Cost Evaluation (IMCE) Task Force to the NASA Advisory Council\u201d (report, Washington, DC, 1 November 2001), http://history.nasa.gov/youngrep.pdf (accessed 26 November 2008).)",

Tani undertook the second EVA of STS-120, disconnecting cables from the P6 truss, to remove the P6 truss from the Z1 truss. Tani and Parazynski made progress outfitting the new Harmony module, mating the power and data grapple fixture, and reconfiguring connectors on the S1 truss, in preparation for the later deployment of the radiator on S1. Tani also inspected the SARJ, collecting fine metal shavings on part of a wheel with solar panels attached to it. The discovery of the metal shavings enabled engineers to identify the source of friction that had caused the wheel to begin slowing down in September. Engineers had designed the wheel to spin freely so that the solar panels pointed toward the Sun; the panels generated electricity to operate the ISS\u2019s computers, oxygen- producing machine, and other systems. Tani reported that, in addition to collecting the metal shavings, he had observed that parts of the wheel\u2019s surface appeared discolored, a possible sign of corrosion. To prevent further damage to the wheel, engineers stopped it from spinning, thereby reducing the amount of electricity that the panels generated. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 33 minutes.(NASA, \u201cNASAfacts; STS-120\u201d; Traci Watson, \u201cDamaged Component Could Thwart Space Station Plans,\u201d USA Today, 29 October 2007; John Schwartz, \u201cAstronauts Discover Damage to Space Station,\u201d 29 October 2007.)",

Sturckow; Pilot Lee J. Archambault; Mission Specialists James F. Reilly II, Patrick G. Forrester, Steven R. Swanson, and John D. Olivas; and Flight Engineer Clayton C. Anderson, who would replace Sunita L. Williams on board the ISS as a member of ISS Expeditions 15 and 16. The launch was nearly flawless. Only one potential problem occurred several minutes into the flight, when on- board cameras captured an image that appeared to show foam flaking off the Shuttle\u2019s external fuel tank, just after the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) had separated from the orbiter. According to Shuttle Program Manager N. Wayne Hale Jr., NASA\u2019s preliminary analysis of the incident indicated that the foam had not struck the craft. NASA planned further analysis.(NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s Shuttle Atlantis Begins Mission to the Space Station,\u201d news release 07-136, 8 June 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jun/HQ_07136_Atlantis_launch.html (accessed 13 April 2010); NASA, \u201cSTS-117 (21st Space Station Flight),\u201d NASAfacts, http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/177714main_STS-117.pdf (accessed 21 May 2010), John Johnson Jr., \u201cFlawless Launch, At Last, For Atlantis,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 9 June 2007.)",

The flight was also the first free flight of an aircraft powered by a supersonic combustion ramjet enginea scramjeta type of engine that provides thrust by funneling air and fuel into a hollow chamber at extremely high speed. The 12-foot-long (3.7-meter-long) unpiloted, experimental aircraft flew for approximately 11 seconds over the Pacific Ocean, at an altitude of 95,000 feet (approximately 29,000 meters), before NASA deliberately landed the aircraft in the ocean. NASA used a modified B-52 aircraft to carry the X-43A into the sky, launching the X-43A into flight using a Pegasus rocket mounted to the B-52. The test flight, which took place near San Nicolas Island off the California coast, originated from NASA\u2019s DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base in California.(Peter Pae, \u201cFast Times at 12 O\u2019Clock High: 5,000 MPH,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 28 March 2004; NASA, \u201cX-43A Soars on Scramjet Power,\u201d 27 March 2004.)",

Russia had scheduled the resupply capsule to arrive at the ISS on 25 December 2004, but if it missed the delivery, crew members Leroy Chiao and Salizhan S. Sharipov would have to return to Earth aboard the Russian Soyuz capsule docked at the ISS. NASA also noted that, if the crew members had to evacuate the space station, Russia and the United States could continue to operate the ISS from Earth. Officials cited a number of reasons for the supply shortage on the ISS, including the postponement of regular supply missions after the Columbia accident and the necessary removal of some food supplies from an August 2004 resupply flight, to make room for equipment to monitor air quality in the ISS.(Mark Carreau, \u201cSpace Station Crew Endures Food Shortage,\u201d Houston Chronicle, 10 December 2004.)",

He had worked as a technical plant manager with the German Guided Missile Center beginning in 1940, but after Germany\u2019s defeat in World War II, Rees became one of 118 scientists who surrendered to the West under the so-called Project Paperclip, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1954. In the United States, he had first worked at White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, \u201cwhere he shared his expertise on the V-2, a German rocket- propelled bomb, and on guided missile projects.\u201d In 1950 Rees had moved to Huntsville, Alabama, to serve as Deputy Chief of the Guided Missile Development Division at Redstone Arsenal. Among the projects Rees had managed were the Hermes II Project, the Redstone and Jupiter missile programs, the Explorer satellite project, and the Saturn program. Between 1956 and 1960, Rees had been Deputy Director of the U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency\u2019s Development Operations Division.

Tito as a member of the Russian crew that would travel aboard the Soyuz to the ISS on 30 April. Space enthusiast Dennis Tito had paid the cash-strapped Russian Space Agency a reported US$20 million to make the trip. Russia\u2019s agreement with the untrained Tito had sparked debate over the proper use of the ISS and over so-called space tourism. Talgat A. Musabayev, the Kazakh cosmonaut who was to command Tito\u2019s crew, removed his men from the training program in Houston after learning that NASA would not allow Tito to participate in the exercises. NASA argued that allowing a person who had not trained as an astronaut to travel to space would pose safety risks, especially since the ISS remained a work-in-progress. Russian officials contended that they had the right to transport aboard their spacecraft any person they deemed fit for the mission. Both sides pledged to find a resolution to the disagreement.(Kathy Sawyer, \u201cSpace Tourism Sparks U.S.-Russian Standoff,\u201d Washington Post, 20 March 2001; Warren E.

The effort was the first of three planned realignment maneuvers. NASA officials wanted to allow Atlantis\u2019s thrusters to have a day to cool down before continuing with the project. In addition to changing the ISS\u2019s orbit, Atlantis\u2019s astronauts serviced the exterior of the space station and replaced four of its failing batteries. The crew hoped that the latter procedure would stop the gradual drop in elevation that the ISS had been experiencing during the months before Atlantis\u2019s visit.(Los Angeles Times, \u201cShuttle Gives Space Station a Boost,\u201d 24 May 2000; Associated Press, \u201cAtlantis Lifts Space Station to Right Orbit,\u201d 24 May 2000; Associated Press, \u201cSpace Station Gets Fresh Batteries,\u201d 24 May 2000.)",

The researchers had closely examined M4\u2019s white dwarf starslow-mass stars that have exhausted their fuel sources for thermonuclear fusion. Although white dwarfs cool at a predictable rate, enabling scientists to estimate their age, they become progressively fainter as they cool, making them difficult to observe. The HST had provided the first deep exposures of these dim stars, which the astronomers discovered were M4\u2019s oldest white dwarf stars, at around 12 to 13 billion years old. Earlier Hubble observations had revealed that the first stars in the universe had formed less than 1 billion years after the universe\u2019s emergence from the Big Bang. Thus, the researchers had discovered that the age of these M4 white dwarfs supported the previous estimates that the universe\u2019s age is 13 to 14 billion years old.

The HST data revealed that black holes in globular star clusters are proportionally smaller than massive black holes found in galaxies, demonstrating that the mass of a black hole is proportional to its stellar surroundings. The results also indicated that when the globular star clusters had formed they had black holes, suggesting that, to form large star clusters, black holes must act as gravitational anchors.

The X-43A contained an experimental engine\u2015called a supersonic combustion ramjet or scramjet. The scramjet engine had no moving parts and did not use fuel from an on-board tank, as is the case with rockets. Instead, the engine used oxygen from the atmosphere, passing through the vehicle, to ignite fuel. NASA had explored the use of scramjets as an alternative to rocket power for space-access vehicles, with the hope that scramjet vehicles would operate more like an airplane than a rocket. The mission lifted off from NASA\u2019s DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 2:30 p.m. (PST). A NASA B-52 carried the unpiloted X-43A to an altitude of 40,000 feet (7.6 miles or 12.2 kilometers). Before the X-43A had attained at an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers), a Pegasus rocket booster launched from the B-52, providing an initial acceleration that enabled the X-43A to attain an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers). The experimental aircraft flew for nearly 10 seconds at that altitude before descending into the Pacific Ocean as planned, nearly 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) off the coast of California.(John Johnson, \u201cX-43A Aircraft Sets Speed Record at 6,500 MPH,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 17 November 2004; NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s X-43A Scramjet Breaks Speed Record,\u201d news release 04-373, 16 November 2004.)",

The discovery of the three planets orbiting the Sun-like star HD 69830, which is approximately 41 light-years from Earth, marked the first time that astronomers had identified a system composed of several planets, each planet possessing a mass approximating that of Neptune. Theoretical calculations of the complexion of the three planets had indicated that the two closest to HD 69830 have a rocky composition similar to the planet Mercury. The astronomers reported that the outermost planet likely has a significant gaseous envelope, surrounding a core composed of rock or ice or a combination of the two, and that the temperatures of the planet are moderate enough to allow the existence of liquid water. The team had discovered the planets using the European Southern Observatory\u2019s 3.6-meter (11.8-foot) telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The telescope was equipped with a precise spectrograph to detect small wobbles induced by the Puppis planets in the HD 69830 star. The technique of detecting and studying these wobbles enabled astronomers to measure the 64 gravitational influence of a planet on its parent star and, thereby, to infer the planet\u2019s presence.",

        "story": "An international team of astronomers, led by Wendy L. Freedman of the Carnegie Observatories, held a news conference to announce their findings regarding the age of the universe. Freedman\u2019s team had concluded that the universe was between 12 billion and 13.4 billion years old, at least 1 billion years younger than predicted. Freedman\u2019s international team had studied eight years of calculations, made observations using NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and used a range of celestial measurements to recalculate the age of the universe. Among those measurements was the \u201cHubble constant,\u201d used in mathematical equations to \u201cgauge the speed at which galaxies are accelerating away from each other.\u201d Named for Edwin Hubble, who had discovered 70 years ago that the universe is expanding, the Hubble constant is an essential piece of the equation determining the age and size of the universe. The team\u2019s findings drew criticism from other astronomers. Although the Australian physicist Charles H. Lineweaver had conducted separate research with the same result as that of Freedman\u2019s team, some astronomers associated with the Carnegie Observatories and Harvard University did not agree with the Freedman team\u2019s conclusions. Allan Sandage of the Carnegie Observatories stated that he believed that the team\u2019s methodology contained systematic errors and that the final number was not correct. Harvard University astronomer Robert P. Kirshner had led a third team, using the Hubble constant to study the age of the universe, but although he calculated a different age than the other teams, Kirshner downplayed the differences in their results, remarking that \u201cwhat was once a very big disagreement is now narrowing down.\u201d(NASA Johnson Space Center, \u201cHubble Completes Eight-Year Effort To Measure Expanding Universe,\u201d news release H99-65, 25 May 1999, http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/releases/1999/H99-65.html (accessed 2 January 2008); Robert Lee Hotz, \u201cScientists Calculate Most Precise Age Yet for Universe; Astronomy: New Data, Hubble Telescope Help Two Separate Teams Put Range at 12 Billion to 13.4 Billion Years,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 26 May 1999.)",
