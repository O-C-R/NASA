Scientists were surprised to find that the black holes in the cores of globular star clusters\u2015bright clusters of stars that orbit galaxies, including the Milky Way\u2015are nearly 10,000 times less massive than galaxies. The HST data revealed that black holes in globular star clusters are proportionally smaller than massive black holes found in galaxies, demonstrating that the mass of a black hole is proportional to its stellar surroundings. The results also indicated that when the globular star clusters had formed they had black holes, suggesting that, to form large star clusters, black holes must act as gravitational anchors. Scientists believed these findings might illuminate the process by which galaxies and globular clusters formed. The discovery also suggested that black holes are more ubiquitous than scientists had previously thought.(NASA, \u201cHubble Discovers Black Holes in Unexpected Places,\u201d news release 02-174, 17 September 2002; William Harwood, \u201cFinding May Connect Dots on How Galaxies Form; Mid-size Black Holes Are Discovered,\u201d Washington Post, 18 September 2002.)",

The researchers had closely examined M4\u2019s white dwarf starslow-mass stars that have exhausted their fuel sources for thermonuclear fusion. Although white dwarfs cool at a predictable rate, enabling scientists to estimate their age, they become progressively fainter as they cool, making them difficult to observe. The HST had provided the first deep exposures of these dim stars, which the astronomers discovered were M4\u2019s oldest white dwarf stars, at around 12 to 13 billion years old. Earlier Hubble observations had revealed that the first stars in the universe had formed less than 1 billion years after the universe\u2019s emergence from the Big Bang. Thus, the researchers had discovered that the age of these M4 white dwarfs supported the previous estimates that the universe\u2019s age is 13 to 14 billion years old. The use of this new methodology to estimate the universe\u2019s age represented a major departure from those used previously.(NASA, \u201cHubble Uncovers Oldest \u2018Clocks\u2019 in Space To Read Age of Universe,\u201d news release 02-73, 24 April 2004; Brad M.

Ashby, Pilot Pamela A. Melroy, and crew members Sandra H. Magnus, Piers J. Sellers, David A. Wolf, and Fyodor N. Yurchikhin. STS-112\u2019s major objective was to deliver and install the Starboard One (S1) Truss, the second segment of the ISS\u2019s Integrated Truss Structure. Astronauts Sellers and Wolf planned to make three spacewalks during the installation missiondesignated ISS Assembly Mission 9Ato install and activate the truss. Other mission objectives included transferring experiments and payloads from Atlantis to the ISS, deploying the station\u2019s second S-Band communications system, and installing external camera systems.(NASA, \u201cSTS-112: Extending the Space Station\u2019s Backbone,\u201d http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/ archives/sts- 112/ (accessed 17 October 2008); NASA, \u201cSTS-112 Overview,\u201d http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/ shuttle/archives/sts- 112/mm-sts-112.pdf (accessed 17 October 2008).)",
