      "story": " Using images from NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory, scientists found evidence that an ancient eruption had burst through a cluster of galaxies, which could explain why those galaxies act like massive magnetic fields. Scientists believed that the universe\u2019s largest known structures bounded by gravity\u2015called galaxy clusters\u2015might be the source of highly energetic and recurring explosions, which cause the clusters to behave like huge cosmic magnets. Chandra\u2019s images of the galaxy cluster Abell 2597 had revealed a cloud of hot gas with two dark circular cavities called ghost cavities, containing little x-ray or radio emissions. The images suggested that powerful explosions around a black hole in the cluster\u2019s center might have occurred when these ghost cavities expelled material from the black hole\u2019s vicinity, creating gaps in the cluster\u2019s hot gas. Scientists believed that these cavities might eventually move to the edge of the cluster, similar to the movement of air bubbles to the surface of water, thereby transporting magnetic fields to the cluster gas. The images suggested that these explosions are recurring. If the recurring explosions continue to create more cavities, this could explain the strong magnetic field of the extremely hot gas throughout the cluster.(NASA, \u201cChandra Finds Ghosts of Eruption in Galaxy Cluster,\u201d news release 02-02, 8 January 2002.)",

      "story": " Using the most sensitive images ever taken by the HST, scientists found new evidence of star creation, challenging the findings of much of the existing research on the origin of the universe. Although the HST had captured images of portions of the skies that appear empty to the naked eye, the images revealed nearly 5,000 galaxies. Led by Kenneth M. Lanzetta of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, a team of scientists had examined approximately 150 of those galaxies spectroscopically, inferring from color variations their actual distance from Earth, as well as the properties of less visible light from even fainter and more distant galaxies. The scientists had also conducted spectroscopic analysis of remote quasars to measure the early universe\u2019s gas density, because high gas density implies high creation rates of stars, which are the building blocks of galaxies and the birthplaces of solar systems. The new images indicated that countless stars had begun forming at a period closer to the birth of the universe than previous research had suggested. Although the HST had captured the images in 1995 and 1998, using the most advanced available technology, the findings suggested that the peak of star creation had occurred earlier than Hubble\u2019s ability to detect it. However, the scientists believed that they could date the peak of star creation to within a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.(NASA, \u201cHubble Suggests First Stars Opened in a Blaze of Glory,\u201d news release 02-01, 8 January 2002; William Harwood, \u201cStars May Have Brightened Infant Universe,\u201d Washington Post, 9 January 2002.)",

The researchers hoped that the rovers would be able to perform sustained research on Mars and to assemble and maintain orbiting spacecraft.

In these simulations, the two robots had grasped and carried a container measuring 2.5 meters (8 feet) long, for more than 50 meters (160 feet). The project had used new software called the Control Architecture for Multi-Robot Planetary Outposts, which equipped the rovers with a distributed and autonomous intelligence producing instinctively reactive behaviors, shared sense and control, and collective decision making. This new technology, along with other innovations, had developed rovers\u2015referred to as the Robotic Work Crew\u2015capable of sharing both work and thinking.

In the first conjunction of two spacecraft at an outer planet, the Galileo spacecraft conducted observations from inside Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere, a comet-shaped region of space filled by the planet\u2019s magnetic field. Meanwhile, on the outside of the magnetosphere, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft monitored the effects of solar windparticles that flow from the Sun through the solar system. Scientists augmented the data gathered during these observations with data from near- simultaneous observations collected from radio telescopes on Earth and from spacecraft orbiting Earth, namely the HST and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Researchers found that, although Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere deflects solar winds, shock waves carried by solar winds compress the magnetosphere, stimulate radio emissions from within it, and brighten auroras at the planet\u2019s poles. The observations helped bolster researchers\u2019 confidence in their understanding of Earth\u2019s own protective magnetosphere.(NASA JPL, \u201cSolar Wind Buffets Vast Jupiter Region, Team Approach Reveals,\u201d news release, 27 February 2002; Thomas W.

Scientists had posited that energetic oxygen and sulfur ions steadily precipitate from Jupiter\u2019s inner magnetosphere, entering the planet\u2019s polar regions and producing a northern aurora of x-rays. However, images from Chandra revealed that most of Jupiter\u2019s northern auroral x-rays originate at latitudes that only ions precipitating from Jupiter\u2019s outer magnetosphere could reach. In addition, researchers found that the hot-spot source of the x-rays was pulsating at 45-minute intervals, contradicting scientists\u2019 theory that the x-ray emissions originate from a steady precipitation of ions in the inner magnetosphere.

The team had found large quantities of argon, calcium, magnesium, silicon, and sulphur, moving at 1/10th the speed of light.

Schenk provided evidence that Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa might not be able to support life, challenging many scientists\u2019 previous assessments about the potential for life on the moon. Astrobiologists had theorized that Europa might be able to support life, based on the possibility that it might possess a heat source, liquid water, and organic material, all necessary for life to exist. However, researchers had also known that Europa is covered with a shell of ice, which might be sufficiently thick to prevent sunlight and oxygen from reaching water below the icy surface, thereby impeding Europa\u2019s ability to support life. Using data obtained from NASA\u2019s Galileo and Voyager spacecraft, Schenk had calculated the thickness of Europa\u2019s ice shell by comparing the depths of impact craters on Europa with those on Callisto and Ganymede, two other moons of Jupiter. Schenk\u2019s analysis indicated that Europa\u2019s ice shell is at least 19-kilometers (12-miles) thick\u2015nearly twice that suggested by previous studies and thick enough to prevent the existence of life.(Usha Lee McFarling, \u201cLife on Jupiter Moon Likely on Thin (or Thick) Ice,\u201d Los Angeles Times, 23 May 2002; Paul M.

The finding suggested that many near-Earth asteroids could be binaries. The images, taken by NASA\u2019s Goldstone telescope facility and the National Science Foundation\u2019s Arecibo Observatory, revealed that the asteroid was not one, but two objects, a nearly 800-meter-diameter (2,625-foot-diameter) primary and an almost 300-meter-diameter (985-foot-diameter) secondary, revolving around their common center of mass. The researchers suggested that approximately 16 percent of near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters (655 feet) in diameter could be binary systems. In addition, the analysis suggested that binaries with similar orbits might result from a close encounter of an asteroid and a planet, in which the planet\u2019s gravitational pull breaks off a portion of the asteroid.

Martin of the University of California Santa Barbara found the first evidence that such galaxies produce most of the heavy elements in the universe. Heavy elements, defined as all elements other than hydrogen and helium, are essential for planet formation and can strongly influence astronomical phenomena such as the rate of galaxy formation. Scientists had theorized that, during the early development of the universe, heavy elements emanating from dwarf galaxies played a dominant role in enriching the intergalactic gas that formed other galaxies. Data from NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory enabled Martin and her team to test this idea. They found that NGC 1569 emitted large quantities of heavy elements in extremely hot x-ray winds, the first direct evidence of metal-enriched winds from dwarf galaxies.

Researchers had suggested that atmospheric change, or the melting of glaciers and polar ice, had caused a geographic shift in the planet\u2019s gravitational field, with a decline in upper latitudes and a corresponding increase in lower latitudes. However, NASA scientists Christopher M. Cox and Benjamin F. Chao discovered that the quantity, rate, and timing of atmospheric change and ice melt did not correspond to the magnitude and rate of gravitational shift. Based on their analysis of data that 10 satellites had acquired between 1979 and 2002, Cox and Chao found a more probable explanation of this phenomenon. The data suggested that the oceans had been rapidly transporting substantial quantities of water and ice from higher to lower latitudes, thereby shifting Earth\u2019s mass and causing a corresponding alteration in the planet\u2019s gravitational field from the higher to the lower latitudes. The scientists noted, however, that additional data and analysis were necessary to determine whether their interpretation of the data was correct.(NASA, \u201cSatellites Reveal a Mystery of Large Change in Earth\u2019s Gravity Field,\u201d news release 02-147, 1 August 2002; Christopher M.

Existing theory had posited that comets rarely break up and that, when they do, the fragmentation usually occurs in close proximity to the Sun. However, basing his research on the analysis of images taken by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), operated jointly by NASA and ESA, Sekanina had discovered that comets fragment throughout their lifetimes, often at distances far from the Sun. Moreover, Sekanina had found that such fragmentation generally occurs in a somewhat orderly pattern, with a single comet fragmenting into clusters of smaller comets. Sekanina had analyzed a type of very small comet called a sungrazer and discovered that sungrazers are actually fragments of other comets that have broken apart during a previous encounter with the Sun. Moreover, he had found that sungrazers continue to break into pieces throughout their orbits around the Sun. Sekanina had also examined another type of comet\u201557P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delaporte, finding that this type of comet shows the same pattern of fragmenting into smaller comets as it moves farther from the Sun.(NASA, \u201cComets Break Up Far and Near,\u201d news release 02-158, 5 September 2002; Zdenek Sekanina, \u201cRunaway Fragmentation of Sungrazing Comets Observed with the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory,\u201d Astrophysical Journal 576, no. 2 (10 September 2002): 1085\u20131089.)",

Under the US$824.8 million contract, TRW and its partner organizations would build an observatory capable of viewing deeper into space than the HST. The telescope\u2019s main mirror would unfold to a diameter of at least 20 feet (6.1 meters), thereby providing six times more light-gathering area than the HST, which had an 8-foot (2.4-meter) primary mirror. The telescope would also have instruments highly sensitive to infrared light, which would help astronomers understand the universe\u2019s creation and evolution. In addition, NASA planned for the new telescope to orbit 940,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, within the second Lagrange point or L2, where a spacecraft maintains a balance between the gravity of the Sun and of Earth. Although the L2 orbit would be too far from Earth to allow astronauts to service the observatory, it would enable the observatory to cool to very low temperatures without the use of complex refrigeration equipment.(NASA, \u201cNASA Announces Contract for Next-Generation Space Telescope Named After Space Pioneer,\u201d news release 02-171, 10 September 2002.)",

      "story": " With the aid of NASA\u2019s High Energy Transient Explorer (HETE), scientists were able to capture the first images ever taken of an unusual gamma-ray burst (GRB) that signals the birth of a new black hole. With the exception of the Big Bang, GRBs are the most powerful type of explosion known. The bursts last for only a few seconds, yet their afterglows can last for days or even longer. However, scientists had been unable to detect an optical afterglow produced by a fast- fading type of dark GRB\u2015until the HETE indicated that such a burst was occurring. NASA had created the satellite to alert ground-based observatories to GRBs. On 11 December 2002, HETE had detected a GRB and, within 22 seconds, had notified observatories of the event\u2019s location. In the following minutes, ground-based telescopes captured images of the burst\u2019s afterglow, which disappeared in 2 hours. The event was a rare subcategory of dark GRBs known as a transitional bursta burst with an afterglow lasting longer than that of the short-duration type, but shorter than that of a long-duration burst. Moreover, these transitional bursts are the rarest type of GRB. Scientists hoped the images would help them learn more about the causes of GRB in general, as well as providing specific data indicating the reason that dark bursts have no detectable afterglow.(NASA, \u201cScientists Catch Their First Elusive \u2018Dark\u2019 Gamma-Ray Burst,\u201d news release 02-257, 23 December 2002.)",

      "story": " The Space Shuttle Competitive Source Task Force released its final report on the potential for private-sector operation of the Shuttle program. NASA had commissioned the Task Force to analyze the roles of NASA and its contractors with regard to Space Shuttle operations. More specifically, the Task Force had assessed various scenarios in which NASA would focus primarily on spaceflight research and development, outsourcing to the private sector the operation of the planned replacements of the Shuttles for routine transit to low Earth orbit. The Task Force had concluded that, although NASA faced numerous challenges to competitive sourcing for the Shuttle program, it should pursue some form of this option. Moreover, the panel suggested that the most likely scenario for successful private-sector involvement in the Shuttle program would not involve private operation of the program, but rather a transfer of program assets to private entities at highly deflated prices. Another option would entail the restructuring of existing contracts, perhaps taking steps to expand the pool of program suppliers beyond the existing duopoly of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. In addition, as a first step to privatization, NASA could establish a space authority to operate the Shuttle, as well as future human transportation vehicles.(Space Shuttle Competitive Sourcing Task Force, \u201cAlternative Trajectories: Options for Competitive Sourcing of the Space Shuttle Program\u201d (Final Report, Science and Technology Policy Institute, Rand Corporation, Arlington, VA, December 2002), http://www.rand.org/scitech/stpi/NASA/index.html (accessed 30 December 2009).)",
