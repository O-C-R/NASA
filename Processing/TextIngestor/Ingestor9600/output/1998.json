Frank Marshall, William W. Zhang, and Eric V. Gotthelf of GSFC found the pulsar by examining x-ray emissions that NASA\u2019s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer spacecraft had recorded in 1996. Observations of the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics spacecraft, a satellite jointly owned by Japan and the United States, confirmed the discovery. The scientists reported that the pulsar was spinning at a rate of 60 times per second, and that it could have been spinning as fast as 150 times per second when it formed 4,000 years ago. An astrophysicist at the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory remarked, \u201cthis is the fastest high-energy pulsar of its type we know about.\u201d The research team reported that the pulsar is \u201clikely associated with the remnant of a supernova (N157B) that exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud about 4,000 years ago.\u201d Comparing the pulsar found in N157B to the high- energy pulsar in the Crab Nebula, the scientists reported that the central source of x-ray light from N157B is this fast-spinning pulsar associated with a supernova remnant, proving the hypothesis that the weaker the magnetic field, the faster the pulsar spins at birth.(NASA, \u201cFast-Spinning Pulsar Discovery Provides Evolutionary Link,\u201d news release 98-14, 26 January 1998.)",

The scientists believed the pulsar to be the missing link between two known types of stars: 1) \u201cold, accreting neutron stars, which are powerful sources of [x]-rays generated from the material they are gobbling up from their companions,\u201d and 2) even older \u201cradiowave emitting pulsars that are rotating very rapidly and slowing down gradually.\u201d Because the new star, designated SAX J1808.4-3658, was both emitting x-rays and spinning rapidly, scientists believed it was the link between the accreting and the radiowaveemitting neutron stars. Michiel van der Klis and Rudy Wijnands of the University of Amsterdam found the new pulsar\u2014called the \u201cHoly Grail of X-ray astronomy\u201d\u2014and measured the time between its rapid x-ray pulses, to derive its rotation rate. Van der Klis explained that, based on the fact of accretion, astrophysicists had long theorized that millisecond pulsars existed, but this was the first time that one had been \u201ccaught in the act.\u201d Accretion, the process of drawing gas from a nearby \u201ccompanion\u201d star, causes pulsars to heat up, emitting x-rays. After accretion ends, high-velocity beams of subatomic particles continue to \u201cblow material off the companion,\u201d eventually causing the companion to vanish. Deepto Chakrabarty and Edward H. Morgan of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led the team that found the pulsar\u2019s 2-hour orbital period, measured the orbit, and inferred the presence of the companion star. Tod E.

Newman undertook their second spacewalk, lasting 7 hours, to install two 100-pound (45.4-kilogram) communications antennas on each side of the Unity module. They hooked one of the antennas to a video cable running from the Zarya module. Then the two astronauts erected a folding sunshade over a computer outside of Unity, bundling loose cables that ran along the exterior of the module. Ross and Newman also removed the restraints that had stabilized the four Unity hatchways during the launch. Finally, Newman successfully tapped free one of Zarya\u2019s stuck antennas, using a 10-foot-long (3-meter-long), extendable grappling hook.(Warren E.
