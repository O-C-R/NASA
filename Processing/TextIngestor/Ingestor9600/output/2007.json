Working for just over 7 hours, the astronauts rerouted a series of two electrical cables and four quick-disconnect fluid lines to the Destiny laboratory\u2019s permanent cooling system; retracted the aft heat-rejecting radiator on the P6 Truss; and finished disconnecting and stowing the second of two fluid lines for the Early Ammonia Servicer. Lopez- Alegria photographed the starboard solar array and the blanket box into which it folds, so that engineers could analyze the photos and finalize plans for its retraction during the Shuttle Mission STS-117, scheduled for March 2007. He also removed a sunshade that the crew no longer needed from a data-relay box, folding the sunshade to bring it inside the ISS, so that the crew could dispose of it later. At the conclusion of the spacewalk, Williams and Lopez-Alegria again followed precautionary decontamination procedures in the ISS\u2019s airlock, as they had on 31 January, because they had seen ammonia flakes early in the spacewalk.

The NRC focused, in particular, on its previous reports Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium (2001) and Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos (2003). Noting that, over the past decade, the Astrophysics Science Division had made remarkable progress in meeting its goals, the authors of the new NRC report expressed concern that the division would likely produce far fewer discoveries after 2010. The NRC noted that NASA had based its recent discoveries on missions that it had developed during the previous decade. However, at the time NRC was examining NASA\u2019s astrophysics program to prepare the new report, NASA had no small-scale, low-cost missions in development. The report warned of a four-year gap in NASA\u2019s missions between 2009, when NASA had scheduled the launch of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and 2013, when NASA planned to launch the JWST. According to the report, NASA had skewed its astrophysics portfolio in favor of the largest missions, at the expense of smaller missions that could launch more frequently, such as the Explorer program missions. The report recommended that NASA restore funding for Explorer missions, even if funding those missions required that NASA scale back larger programs already in development.(National Research Council, National Astrophysics Performance Assessment Committee, A Performance Assessment of NASA\u2019s Astrophysics Program (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2007), http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11828#toc (accessed 5 March 2010); National Academies, \u201cCost Overruns, Cancelling of Small Missions Have Led to Lost Science Opportunities at NASA,\u201d news release, 7 February 2007, http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11828 (accessed 10 December 2009); New Scientist, \u201cReport Slams NASA\u2019s Neglect of Small Missions,\u201d 7 February 2007.)",

Because the satellites were preprogrammed, ground controllers had been unable to transmit commands to the satellites\u2019 computers. To avoid such an event in the future, DARPA had designed the Orbital Express satellites to accept guidance from ground controllers.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 641, 1 April 2007, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx641.html (accessed 25 January 2010); Todd Halvorson, \u201cAtlas 5 Launches Satellites,\u201d Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 9 March 2007; Shelby G.

The Stargazer launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 21:26 (UT). NASA had designed AIM to study noctilucent clouds (NLCs) in the polar mesosphere. Observers can only see NLCs at night. Shortly before the mission, these clouds had appeared more often and had grown brighter. Observers had first seen NLCs in the 1880s, soon after the massive volcanic eruption on the Indonesian island of Krakatoa. Space- based satellites had periodically observed the clouds since the 1980s. AIM was the first spacecraft devoted to the study of NLCs. Scientists hoped to answer basic questions about why the clouds form and whether human-caused global warming was responsible for the recent changes. AIM carried three instruments: the Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) would remotely sense the gases that condense to NLCs; the Cosmic Dust Experiment (CDE) would serve as an in situ sampler of the cosmic dust over the NLCs; and the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) experiment, a panoramic ultraviolet (UV) imager of the NLCs operating in the 265-nanometer-wavelength band, would provide the morphology of the clouds in both hemispheres.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 642; NASA, \u201cNASA\u2019s AIM Mission Soars to the Edge of Space,\u201d news release 07-92, 25 April 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/apr/HQ_07092_AIM_launch.html (accessed 16 February 2010); Associated Press, \u201cNASA Launches Satellite To Study Clouds,\u201d 26 April 2007.)",

The studies complemented two new programs already established in the Science Mission Directorate\u2019s Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters\u2014the Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research (LASER) Program and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Participating Scientist Program. The LRO mission, scheduled to launch in 2008, would help NASA prepare for long-duration human operations on the Moon. For that program, NASA planned to fund researchers analyzing data from the orbiter\u2019s six instruments.

Boeing Phantom Works had developed the BWB in cooperation with NASA and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory. The remotely controlled X-48B had taken off from NASA\u2019s Edwards Air Force Base in California, climbing to an altitude of 7,500 feet (2,286 meters) and landing 31 minutes after takeoff. Boeing had developed two X-48B research vehicles to gather detailed information about the stability and flight-control characteristics of the BWB design, particularly during takeoff and landing. Previously, Boeing had used Ship 2, the test-flight vehicle, for ground and taxi testing. Ship 1, which had completed extensive testing in 2006 at the Old Dominion University\u2019s NASA Langley Full-Scale Wind Tunnel in Virginia, was the backup vehicle for the flight-test program. The BWB design resembled a flying wing, but the wing blended smoothly into a wide, flat, tailless fuselage, helping the craft gain additional lift with less drag than a circular fuselage. NASA\u2019s DFRC had provided engineering and technical support for the BWB, based on its years of operating cutting-edge, remotely controlled aircraft. NASA had focused on developing fundamental flight dynamics and structural concepts for the BWB, as well as helping to validate and verify its hardware and software and to integrate and test the aircraft\u2019s systems and the pilot\u2019s ground-control station.

Moreover, MRO images indicated that, although certain gullies and rims of craters did indeed contain liquid water, the presence of water at these locations did not reveal the presence of a water table.

      "story": " NASA announced that one of its STEREO satellites had recorded images of an April 2007 collision between a comet and a solar hurricane, marking the first time that scientists had observed such an event. Encke\u2019s comet, traveling in the orbit of Mercury, had encountered a CME. NASA had designed STEREO to observe this type of solar event. As the CME swept by, the comet\u2019s tail had brightened and then had disconnected, as the front of the ejection carried it away. Scientists had known that a comet\u2019s plasma tail could disconnect from the comet, but the conditions necessary for this to occur had remained a mystery. Preliminary analysis of the images, which NASA researchers had combined into a movie, indicated that a phenomenon called magnetic reconnection had caused the tail to detach. In a magnetic reconnection event, the magnetic fields in a CME crunch together the oppositely directed magnetic fields around a comet, causing the comet fields to link together suddenly. This sudden reconnection releases a burst of energy that detaches the comet\u2019s tail. Angelos Vourlidas of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, was lead author of an article about the event, published in the 10 October 2007 issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters. Remarking on the researchers\u2019 sense of awe when they viewed the images, Vourlidas described their surprise at seeing the disconnection of the tail, calling the event \u201cthe icing on the cake.\u201d(NASA, \u201cNASA Satellite Sees Solar Hurricane Detach Comet Tail,\u201d news release 07-214, 1 October 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/oct/HQ_07214_Comet_Collision.html (accessed 8 September 2010); Andrea Thompson, \u201cSolar Storm Rips Tail Off Comet,\u201d Space.com, 1 October 2007, http://www.space.com/ scienceastronomy/071001_hurr_comet.html (accessed 27 September 2010).)",

NASA had launched FUSE in 1999 to study how chemicals disperse throughout galaxies, as well as the composition of interstellar gas clouds. FUSE\u2019s mission was to help answer important questions about the conditions in the universe immediately following the Big Bang. However, FUSE\u2019s reaction wheels, designed to turn and aim the telescope, holding it on target, had malfunctioned. To operate correctly, FUSE required three reaction wheels, but in November and December 2001, two of the four wheels had stopped operating. FUSE flew too high for the Space Shuttle to carry astronauts to repair it. Therefore, NASA scientist Jeffrey W. Kruk had devised a way to use FUSE\u2019s magnetic torquer bars, designed to act as a weak break against Earth\u2019s magnetic field, as a third wheel to help FUSE\u2019s remaining wheel and backup wheel turn and aim the telescope.

Parazynski successfully cut loose a tangled set of wires that had prevented a solar array at the ISS from unfurling properly on 30 October. Parazynski rode on the end of the robotic arm extension, which at 90 feet (27 meters) barely reached the damaged solar wing. The extension placed Parazynski farther away from the ISS than any astronaut had ever been. After 1 hour riding the extension out to the power grid, Parazynski worked for 2 hours, cutting hinge wires and guide wires. Once cut, the 90-foot (27-meter) guide wire retracted smoothly into its reel at the base of the solar wing. Throughout the operation, Parazynski used an L-shaped Teflon stick wrapped in insulating tape to keep the solar wing away, protecting himself from electrical shock.

Hinode\u2019s high-resolution x-ray telescope had revealed a record number of x-ray jets\u2014up to 240\u2014in the corona at the Sun\u2019s poles, contrary to previous research that had detected only a few such jets daily. Based on observation of these solar jets, a team led by solar physicist Jonathan W. Cirtain, of NASA\u2019s MSFC, concluded that a magnetic reconnection occurring in the low solar corona was forming Alfvén waves and bursts of energized plasma in the x-ray jets. Alfvén waves form when convective motions and sound waves push magnetic fields around, or otherwise allow magnetic fields to change shape or to reconnect. Previously, researchers had been unable to observe Alfvén waves because of the limited resolution of available instruments. Yet, in their search to identify the forces responsible for the formation of solar winds, scientists had long considered Alfvén waves the leading candidate. Alfvén waves are capable of transferring energy from the Sun\u2019s surface up through its atmosphere (corona) and into the solar wind. Cirtain explained that the team\u2019s observations had revealed a clear relationship between magnetic reconnection and the formation of Alfvén waves in the x-ray jets, and that \u201cthe large number of jets, coupled with the high speeds of the outflowing plasma, lends further credence to the idea that x-ray jets are a driving force in the creation of the fast solar wind.\u201d The team published its findings in the 7 December issue of the journal Science, a special issue focusing on Hinode.(NASA, \u201cSpacecraft Reveals New Insights About the Origin of Solar Wind,\u201d news release 07-264, 6 December 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/dec/HQ_07264_Hinode_Waves.html (accessed 20 October 2010); Jonathan W.

The astronauts focused on inspecting two devices related to the power-generating solar arrays\u2014the SARJ and the beta gimbal assembly (BGA) on the starboard side. Both devices had malfunctioned. The spacewalk, a so-called fact-finding mission, sought to determine what had caused the SARJ to shed metal filings and the BGA to trip circuit breakers. Whitson and Tani found widespread contamination inside the gear that rotates the SARJ. They also retrieved a set of bearings\u2014one of 12 on the joint\u2014suspected of being a source of the contamination. They used orange Kempton tape to take samples of the metal filings. The astronauts found no damage to the cables and other hardware on the BGA joint, which had suffered triple electrical failures on 8 December. During this EVA, Whitson, who had already made history as the first female commander of the ISS, surpassed Sunita L. William\u2019s spacewalking record to set a new record for women in space, at 32 hours and 36 minutes.",

A team of researchers at NASA\u2019s LaRC had created the flexible material using ceramic fibers. Voltage applied to the MFC made the ceramic fibers change shape and expand or contract, causing material to bend or twist. The device had industrial and research applications, primarily for vibration monitoring and dampening. The MFC had improved research on helicopter rotor blades and assisted in detecting pipeline cracks. NASA had used the MFC to monitor the vibrations of support structures near the Space Shuttle launchpads during launches.(NASA, \u201cNASA Names New Composite Government Invention of the Year,\u201d news release 07-287, 21 December 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/dec/HQ_07287_Invention_of_the_Year.html (accessed 20 October 2010).)",
