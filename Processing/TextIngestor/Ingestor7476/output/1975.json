      "story": " Funding in the FY 1976 budget for a third Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) was in doubt, Walter Sullivan said in a New York Times article. Despite worldwide enthusiasm for continuing the program, which was developing remote-sensing techniques for monitoring and managing earth\u2019s resources, doubts about funding approval were appearing within the Office of Management and Budget. Factors that would influence OMB\u2019s decision included the reported existence of far more detailed information from secretly launched intelligence satellites. Although scientists would probably prefer a system free from intelligence links, some argued that the information needed by agencies such as the Bureau of Census and Dept, of Agriculture could be extracted from imagery from these satellites. Another reason to delay immediate funding was that a more effective system would eventually become feasible. Scientists argued against this reasoning, saying that the lack of fine detail in ERTS images was not a serious impediment but that lack of continuity would be. (Sullivan, NYT, 4 Jan 75, 17)",

      "story": " Twenty-five spacecraft on twenty-four vehicles were scheduled for launch by NASA during 1975, NASA announced. The 25 spacecraft included 14 for NASA programs, 10 for other organizations, and 1 as a cooperative program with a foreign government. Highlighting the year would be the 15 July launch of an Apollo spacecraft carrying Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton as the U.S. contribution to the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Apollo would rendezvous and dock with Soyuz 19\u2014launched 7 hr earlier than Apollo and carrying Aleksey A. Leonov and Valery N. Kubasov\u2014allowing both crews to exchange visits and perform joint scientific experiments. The two sets of Viking spacecraft, scheduled for 11 and 21 August launches, would journey through space for a year before arriving in the vicinity of Mars. There each set of spacecraft would separate into an orbiter and a lander to make orbital and surface investigations of the Martian environment. Other NASA spacecraft would include ERTS-B Earth Resources Technology Satellite and SMS-B Synchronous Meteorological Satellite, in January; GOES-C Geodynamic Experimental Ocean Satellite, in March; OSO-I Orbiting Solar Observatory, Nimbus-F experimental meteorological satellite, and Explorer 53 (SAS-C Small Astronomy Satellite), in May; GOES-A Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, in June; Explorers 56 and 57 Dual Air Density Explorers, on a single booster in July or August; Explorer 54 (AE-D Atmospheric Explorer), in September; and Explorer 55 (AE-E), in December.

      "story": " NASA\u2019s Earth Resources Technology Satellite, ERTS, had been renamed Landsat, NASA Associate Administrator for Applications Charles W. Mathews announced at a Landsat\u2014B prelaunch press briefing in Washington, D.C. Erts 1, launched 23 July 1972, would be called Landsat 1; ERTS-B, scheduled for launch 19 Jan., would be designated Landsat 2 once in orbit. Mathews said that, since NASA planned a SEASAT to study the oceans (see 9 Jan.), Landsat seemed a more appropriate name for a satellite that studied the land. Landsat Program Manager Harry Mannheimer said that Landsat\u2014 B would be launched into the same orbital plane as Landsat 1 but 180° out of phase. Between them the two satellites would retrace the identical ground track every 9 days rather than the 18-day interval of one satellite. The additional coverage would enable scientists to study dynamic phenomena more effectively. Mannheimer said that a significant improvement over Landsat 1 was Landsat\u2014B\u2019s increase in command storage, adding flexibility in commanding the various instruments while the spacecraft was out of view of a ground station. James R. Morrison, Landsat Resources Survey Program Manager, said that, whereas the emphasis of the Landsat 1 mission was on experimentation, the emphasis for Landsat\u2014B would be on fewer but larger scale applications of remote-sensing information to real resource problems. Of the 120 investigators\u2014compared with 320 investigators during the Landsat 1 mission\u201457 were U.S.-sponsored and 52 were from foreign countries. During the rigorous selection, preference had been given to investigations that included direct participation and cost-sharing by bona fide users in both the public and private sectors. New with Landsat\u2014 B were the Applications Systems Verification Tests (ASVT), based on results of Landsat 1, to further develop, demonstrate, and document Landsat results. The ASVTs were larger in design and scope than earlier investigations, essentially beyond the capability of any one investigator to manage. ASVTs for Landsat\u2014B included a large-area crop inventory experiment (LACIE), ice-warn program, snow-cover and snow-melt prediction program, natural resources information system, and environmental information system.

(AP, NYT, 22 Jan 75, 33; Robinson, Av Wk, 27 Jan 75, 16\u201417) 22 \u201425 January: NASA launched Landsat 2 (Landsat\u2014B), formerly called Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-B), from Western Test Range at 9:56 am PST on a two-stage Thor-Delta booster supplemented by nine strap-on rockets. The satellite entered a near-polar orbit with a 918.23-km apogee, 912.89-km perigee, 103.32-min period, and 99.09° inclination. Primary objective of the mission was to acquire multispectral imagery over the U.S. and foreign countries in quantity sufficient to improve remote-sensing interpretative techniques and to further demonstrate the practiced application of Landsat data. Secondary objectives were to acquire sufficient multispectral coverage over the U.S. to supply data requirements for the Applications System Verification Tests for at least 1 yr, to acquire multispectral coverage for at least 2 yr over the major agricultural areas of the world to illustrate further applications of Landsat imagery for crop inventory, and to demonstrate successful operation of the Data Collection System. A 3-day delay in the launch changed the initial orbital phasing of Landsat 2 relative to Landsat 1 (launched as Erts 1 on 23 July 1972) into a 12- to 6-day repeat cycle instead of the planned 9-day cycle. However, an orbital correction maneuver beginning 27 Jan. and ending 6 Feb. altered phasing to a 9-day repeat cycle. The payload separated from the launch vehicle 50 min 3 sec after launch, followed by solar-panel deployment and earth acquisition using the attitude-control system. The command system was turned on automatically, permitting activation of the payload by ground stations. During the night of 22\u201423 Jan. the mechanical integrity of the wideband video tape recorder was verified, Data-Collection System (DCS) activated, and data-collection platform experiment data transmitted. By 12:00 pm EST 23 Jan. all spacecraft systems were operating and by 25 Jan. the wideband transmitter, wideband video tape recorder, multispectral scanner (MSS), and return-beam vidicon (RBV) were turned on, and operating normally. Teaming up with Landsat 1, the 953-kg Landsat 2 would provide repetitive coverage of almost the entire earth to demonstrate the practical benefits of resources management from space for NASA in cooperation with the Dept, of Agriculture, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Dept, of the Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various state, local, and foreign organizations. Experiments included the cooperative NASA\u2014DOA\u2014NOAA Large Area Crop Inventory (LACIE), which combined crop-acreage measurements derived from Landsat data with meteorological information from ground stations and NOAA satellites to assess crop yields and make production forecasts. During the first yr of operation, LACIE would concentrate on U.S.-grown wheat, but the experiment would later be expanded to other crops and other regions. Other experiments included land-use survey and mapping; mineral resources, geological, structural, and land-form surveys; water resources studies; marine and ocean surveys; meteorological and environmental studies; and interpretative techniques development. Data were being transmitted to three NASA tracking and data-acquisition facilities at Fairbanks, Al.; Goldstone, Calif.; and Greenbelt, Md. In addition, Canada and Brazil operated Landsat ground data-acquisition stations and Italy and Iran were constructing similar facilities. Data received from the satellite were sent to the NASA Data Processing Facility at Goddard Space Flight Center where 1300 images, covering 45 million sq km, could be processed each week. The data would then be forwarded to the Federal Data Center and made available to the public. The Landsat mission was part of a U.S. program to develop remotesensing methods for improved management of earth\u2019s resources. In addition to Landsat 1 and 2, the program included remote-sensor instrument development; data-analysis research using data from spacecraft, aircraft, and ground-truth sites; low-, intermediate-, and high-altitude aircraft flights; and Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP) experiments completed during the 1973 manned Skylab missions.

Analyzing high-resolution infrared data on successive star flashes representing from a fraction of a year to a million years in the evolution of a red giant, Dr. Christy-Sackmann found that the violent combustion of helium in the heart of the stars, releasing heat up to 260 million°C, produced a predominance of carbon. She stressed the convective role of helium and hydrogen in fueling the stellar fires: A convective tongue of helium was driven through layers of burning shells toward the outer envelope of hydrogen. Hydrogen might also drop down to overlap, giving extra energy to an old star. The release of energy from the interior of the stars varied, apparently because of convective zones that seemed to come and go. Although each flash produced extreme interior disruption, surface changes in most cases were minor. The length of time required for computation had prevented previous investigators from following and analyzing more than a few of the hundreds of successive flashes occurring in a star; using the new computer technique, Dr. Christy-Sackmann planned to analyze hundreds.

The recommended deficit of $51.9 billion was a peacetime record high designed to help revive the Nation\u2019s sagging economy. In his budget message to Congress, the President said that his recommendations provided for fiscal policy actions to increase purchasing power and stimulate economic revival; a major new energy program to hold down energy use, accelerate development of domestic energy resources, and promote energy research and development; an increase in outlays for defense to maintain preparedness and preserve force levels in the face of rising costs; a 1-yr moratorium on new Federal spending programs other than energy; and a temporary 5% ceiling on increases in pay for Federal employees and on individual benefits tied to changes in consumer prices. Proposals included a one-time $16-billion tax cut\u2014 $12 billion for individual taxpayers and $4 billion for business\u2014to stimulate economic recovery. Energy: The President specifically requested that no new Federal spending programs be initiated in FY 1976 except in the field of energy, which had a total recommended budget authority set at $2,491 billion. Federal energy functions were divided into three broad categories: general operating programs (analysis and development of energy policy), regulatory programs, and research and development programs. General operating programs, with a recommended budget authority of $548 million, would be administered by the Federal Energy Administration (FEA), Dept, of the Interior, and the new Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). Federal energy regulation, with a recommended budget authority of $178 million, was managed by FEA, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and Federal Power Commission. Although the new budget called for support from NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF) for energy R&D, ERDA would have the major responsibility. The proposed energy program called for an increased fee on imported oil and an excise tax on domestically produced petroleum and natural gas.

      "story": " Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released the budget statement he had given at a 1 Feb. press briefing. The FY 1976 NASA budget called for the authorization of $3,539 billion and net outlays of $3,498 billion for the 12-mo period beginning 1 July, and additional NASA Budget Plan, FY 76 (in millions of dollars) FY 1974- FY 1975 FY 1976 Research and Development 2310.9 2323.3 2678.4 Construction of Facilities 101.1 142.7 84.6 Research and Program Management 744.0 765.2 776.0 amounts of $958.9 million in authorizations and $905.6 in net outlays for the 3-mo transition period beginning 1 July 1976. Dr. Fletcher said the new budget was \u201clean but manageable.\u201d For the first time since 1961 the budget provided no new program starts. In accordance with President Ford\u2019s request \"to hold FY J975 and FY 1976 expenditures to a minimum, NASA, in FY 1975, had deferred obligations of $72 million and outlays of $70 million, reduced civil service employment by 300, and made program adjustments to stay within the total FY 1975 and 1976 hudgets. Further adjustments might be necessary if the inflation rate continued to grow. Although NASA\u2019s FY 1976 budget was up $300 million from the previous year, $200 million of this increase was specifically anticipated in last year\u2019s budget to carry forward commitments built into programs approved in FY 1975. Therefore, NASA had received an effective increase of only $100 million, or about 3%. This, along with the nation\u2019s current 9% inflation rate, was a \u201cgood indicator of the leanness of NASA\u2019s FY 1976 budget.\u201d The budget would permit NASA to proceed with current major programs as planned: The Space Shuttle, scheduled for a first manned orbital flight in mid-1979, and Landsat\u2014C, scheduled for a fall 1977 launch, would continue on schedule. Reduction of fuel use in aircraft remained a principal focus in NASA\u2019s aeronautics research and technology. NASA was also continuing stratospheric studies, including the effects of pollutants on the environment, with significant contributions coming from NASA meteorological and atmospheric satellites, sounding rockets, and balloons and high-flying aircraft. Although there would be no new starts, NASA would continue its study and advanced technical development for science, applications, and aeronautics projects to be started in future years, including preliminary work for payloads to fly on the Space Shuttle and Spacelab. The 1975 calendar year launch schedule was one of the most ambitious in U.S. history with 28 launches scheduled, including the joint U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in July and the two Viking missions to Mars scheduled for August. Although NASA\u2019s legal responsibilities for energy research and development\u2014designated under the Solar Heating and Cooling Act of 1974\u2014had been transferred to the Energy Research and Development Administration, NASA would work closely with ERDA in various aspects of solar research and development. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said at the press briefing that the largest budget increase was for manned spaceflight, where the increase for the Shuttle was partially offset by reduced spending for the rest of manned spaceflight. The small increase for space science did not tell the whole story: If funds for the Viking program were subtracted, the budget for the rest of science had increased $170 million from FY 1974 to FY 1976. Although applications, aeronautics, and space technology programs each showed small increases, funds for tracking and data acquisition decreased slightly despite increased maintenance costs for tracking stations, because NASA was beginning to close down tracking stations, preparing for the time when tracking and data relay satellites would be available. .

Lilly, NASA Comptroller, said that, of the $84.6 million budgeted for construction of facilities, $47.2 million was to continue the buildup of Space Shuttle facilities, mostly for launch and landing facilities at Kennedy Space Center. The remaining funds were for normal rehabilitation and modification of existing facilities, with smaller amounts for minor construction and for facilities planning and design. Civil service manpower was expected to continue at the same level for FY 1976 with 24 316 employees. However, the number of support service contractors\u2014excluding mission or stage contractors\u2014would decrease from 18 637 in FY 1975 to 17 811 in FY 1976. The estimated 125 000 persons working on NASA programs during FY 1975 was expected to increase by 6000 to 7000 by the end of FY 1976. Distribution of funds to the Centers would change: An increase of $224.3 million would go to Johnson Space Center for the Shuttle program. A decrease of $37.3 million for KSC reflected a decrease in funding for the construction program.

Launched for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the three-stage inertially guided Thor-Delta booster placed the satellite in an orbit with a 36 810-km apogee, 197-km perigee, 651.0-min period, and 23.9P inclination. Originally scheduled for 30 Jan., the launch had been delayed to replace the Inertial Measurement Unit of the launch vehicle\u2019s flight-control system with a newer more reliable unit. The spacecraft performed normally during the transfer orbit, and attitude and reorientation maneuvers were performed as planned. The apogee boost motor was fired on second apogee at 9:43 am EST 7 Feb. placing Sms 2 in a synchronous orbit; orbital parameters were 36 685-km apogee,. 35 680-km perigee, 1456.4-min period, and 1.1° inclination. By 10 Feb. the spacecraft was drifting westward at 6° per day toward the final operational station of 115° west longitude. Over several days beginning 10 Feb., the onboard auxiliary propulsion system was fired to place the spacecraft into proper attitude for operational use. First photos were transmitted 11 Feb. NASA objectives\u2014to launch the spacecraft into a synchronous orbit of sufficient accuracy to enable the spacecraft to accomplish its operational mission requirements, conduct an in-orbit evaluation and checkout of the spacecraft, and turn operational control over to NOAA\u2014were met, and the mission was adjudged successful 22 April. NASA turned over control of Sms 2 to NOAA 10 March. The 628-kg cylindrical spacecraft carried five instruments to provide high-quality day and night cloudcover data; take radiance temperatures of the earth\u2019s atmosphere; measure proton, electron, and solar x-ray fluxes, and magnetic fields; transmit processed data from central facilities to regional stations; and transmit environmental information to NOAA from the thousands of manned and unmanned data-collection platforms on land, rivers, lakes, and the sea. Sms 2, together with its sister craft Sms 1 (launched 17 May 1974), provided continuous coverage of the Western Hemisphere, transmitting weather photos every 30 min. SMS photos would be made into film loops of clouds moving over oceans and land masses to help meteorologists determine what types of cloud formations and weather conditions might cause the destructive tornadoes and hurricanes that frequently occur over the eastern U.S. Sms 2 was the second in a series of two operational prototypes and one operational spacecraft (SMS-C, to be called Goes 1 in orbit) developed and funded by NASA to meet the requirements of the Dept, of Commerce\u2019s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system.

Ivanchenkov\u2014arrived in Washington, D.C., 7 Feb. and traveled to Kennedy Space Center the following morning. The group toured KSC 8 Feb. giving the cosmonauts their first glimpse of the U.S. launch complex. Col. Leonov commented that the pad from which Alan B. Shepard was launched in 1961 \u201cis a very simple launch stand compared to the ones we use now.\u201d Following a tour of Disney World in Florida 9 Feb., the cosmonauts spent 10 Feb. inspecting the Vehicle Assembly Building, where the Apollo would be stacked on the Saturn IB launch vehicle; the Launch Control Center firing room, from which the rocket would be controlled; and Launch Complex 39 Pad B, from which the Apollo spacecraft would be launched. Press coverage of the first Soviet visit to KSC noted that previous invitations for Soviet officials to visit KSC had been turned down,apparently because of Soviet unwillingness to reciprocate with invitations to Baykonur Cosmodrome. But in May U.S. astronauts would return the visit by going to the Soviet launch site. The astronauts and cosmonauts flew to Johnson Space Center to begin a 2-wk training period that included exercises in command and docking module simulators and mockups; joint language-training sessions; briefings on experiments, contingencies, and mission rules; and practice run-throughs of the planned joint activity days. Following a press conference at which U.S. and Soviet ASTP crew members were introduced to JSC employees, the Soviet cosmonauts returned to the U.S.S.R. in two groups, on 28 Feb. and 1 March.

The first flight unit would be delivered 1 yr later. The first mission of the Spacelab would be a joint U.S.\u2014European venture. A call for ideas for experiments had netted 243 proposals, from which a selection would be made; the selection process for European payload specialists would begin in 1975. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, addressed the gathering 26 Feb. He noted that, although aerospace technology had been one of the \u201ckey drivers\u201d in retaining the U. S. lead in world technology, a feeling of the importance of technology was \u201cnot universally shared.\u201d A decline in the national emphasis on technology \u201chas much to do with the decline in productivity in this country.\u201d The increasing cost and complexity of applying new technology had become a vexing national problem. Finding new ways to reduce costs was a key management task that the aerospace business must face. Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, said in an address 26 Feb. that satellite-delivered services in Alaska had been so successful that the Alaskan Federation of Natives \u2014a highly representative broad-based grassroots organization\u2014had made them the organization\u2019s top priority. The goal was to achieve an operational satellite service for health, education, and other communications needs. The formation of the Public Service Satellite Users Consortium, consisting of health and educational organizations, represented the first effort to organize a market of small independent users sufficient to attract private investment capital for large-scale technology to meet their collective needs. HEW was investigating the possibility of a \u201csocial service satellite\u201d to meet the needs of various public and social service communities by means of an inexpensive ground receiver. The satellite could dramatically reduce the cost of such services while greatly increasing the quality. At the Honors Night Banquet 26 Feb., Chairman Hansen was installed as the 13th president of the AIAA. The 19 newly elected fellows included Hans M.

ASTP participants would be conducting experiments in space sciences, life sciences, and applications, ASTP Project Scientist Dr. Thomas Giuli said at an experiments briefing. The five space-science experiments included a soft x-ray experiment to study radiation by scanning across the celestial mode, pointing at known discrete sources in the soft part of the spectrum from 2 kev to 0.1 kev, and investigating 10 specific x-ray sources known to emit only in regions below 2 kev. A helium-glow experiment would investigate temperature and density of the interstellar medium in the vicinity of our solar system by observing two special frequencies of extreme ultraviolet light emitted from the sun after they traveled into interstellar space, hit the interstellar medium, and were reflected back again. Other space-science experiments included a study of the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere during an artificial eclipse created by maneuvering the Apollo spacecraft. During the \u201ceclipse,\u201d the Soyuz crew would photograph the sun\u2019s corona. Among the earth environmental and applications studies was an experiment to measure neutral atomic oxygen and neutral atomic nitrogen of the earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. Another experiment would try to devise a simple means of monitoring the aerosol content of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. A water-resources management experiment, planned and coordinated with the government of India, would photograph the Himalayan area to map drainage patterns and water-reservoir locations. Life-science experiments included a study to observe optical sensations from cosmic rays experienced by the crew, an investigation of mutation in cells grown in space, and studies of the effect of space flight on the ability of microbes to infect humans and of changes in the human immunity system to resist infections under space flight conditions. . At a mission profile briefing, Kenneth A. Young of JSC\u2019s Mission Planning and Analysis Div. said that plans called for a 9-day Apollo mission beginning 7.5 hrs after the launch of Soyuz by the U.S.S.R. The planned rendezvous period would be 2 days, with docking scheduled for the 30th inertial orbit, or third day in flight, of the Apollo spacecraft. Following much negotiation, U.S. and Soviet mission planners determined that the two spacecraft would dock over Soviet territory, providing real-time telemetry coverage for the Soviet Union, but at a location where NASA\u2019s Ats 6 communications satellite could provide communications coverage to the U.S. The first handshake would take place over Spain. The spacecraft would undock on the 5th day and perform several joint experiments while separated. Soyuz was scheduled to land the following day. Apollo would continue unilateral experiments in orbit before landing at the end of the 9th day in space. Astronaut Richard H. Truly said, during a joint crew activities briefing, that while the Apollo and Soyuz were docked, all communications would be conducted in the language of the listener regardless of the nationality of the speaker.

Data returned by Pioneer II (launched 5 April 1973, and renamed Pioneer Saturn following the flyby) suggested that Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field might be created by a large ring current and many eddies deep within the planet. Earlier measurements from Pioneer 10, launched toward Jupiter on 2 March 1972, had indicated only a simple magnetic envelope with a single \u201cring current\u201d much like earth\u2019s. The more complex magnetic field could explain the Jovian field\u2019s high-energy particle pattern as well as the bursts of intense radio energy observed emanating from the planet. Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field stretched across 14 million km in some places and shrank in volume by three-fourths or more in others; inside this pulsating field were belts of intense radiation with trapped electrons 10 000 times more intense than those in earth\u2019s Van Allen belts. Pioneer had experienced peak intensities of high-energy electrons that were moderately higher than those found by Pioneer 10, encountering 10 times as many electrons as predicted by earth-based studies. Peak intensities of very high-energy protons were 100 times stronger than predicted but concentrated in small shallow regions. Other early findings of Pioneer 11 included the observation that Jupiter\u2019s cloud tops were substantially lower at the poles than at the equator and were covered by a thicker transparent atmosphere. Also, the clouds at the planet\u2019s south pole were lower than those at the north pole.

To prepare for the flyby, the trajectory had been corrected on 30 Oct. 1974 and 13 Feb. 1975. An additional correction 7 March was to reduce the probability of Mariner 10\u2019s impacting the surface of Mercury from 30% to 1%, targeting Mariner 10 to approach the planet from the sunlit side, then loop around behind it. One last-minute problem was navigational difficulty in locking onto the star Canopus so that the spacecraft would point in the proper direction for data collection. Because a commanded roll search for Canopus would expend all remaining attitude-control gas, Mariner 10 had to be maneuvered using solar-radiation pressure on the solar panels and high-gain antenna. The problem was intensified because of the tandem demands of Helios 1 and Mariner 10 on the antennas of NASA\u2019s deep-space tracking network. However, the primary users\u2014 West German scientists tracking Helios 1\u2014gave receiving time to the Mariner 10 flight controllers, who obtained Canopus lock in time for the encounter. Major objective of the third encounter was to determine whether Mercury had an intrinsic or induced magnetic field. In a press briefing 17 March, Dr. Norman F. Ness, principal investigator of the magnetic fields experiment, said that Mercury did have an intrinsic magnetic field, encountered on the incoming trajectory at precisely the time predicted from the first Mercury pass. Mariner 10 had measured the field to be a maximum of400 gamma. Plasma science experiment data supported the presence of the field; Dr. Ness observed that the interface between the solar wind and Mercury\u2019s magnetic field appeared to be a scaled-down version of the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetic field of earth. The spacecraft returned about 300 TV pictures of the planet\u2019s surface between 12 and 17 March, with best resolution at 100 m obtained from quarter-frame near-encounter pictures. All photos were transmitted in real time and at 22 kilobits per sec, instead of the planned 117, because of overheating of the spacecraft.

Av Wk interviewed the Director of Mission and Payload Integration in NASA\u2019s Office of Manned Space Flight, Philip E. Culbertson, who said that it would be better, in the long term, to move into a position where more organizations outside NASA were sponsoring and paying for missions and payloads. The agency was encouraged by the interest of industries in flying and funding Space Shuttle missions involving a wide range of basic scientific and technical operations. Foreign reimbursable payloads, already an important part of NASA launch operations, were seen as an even iarger factor in Shuttle payloads development. Japan, already holding discussions with NASA to lay the groundwork for a viable national space program, was considered a serious Shuttle customer; Japan would like to develop both scientific and earth applications programs in the communications, navigation, and weather satellite fields.. Canada\u2019s interest in positioning domestic communications satellites over its territory would continue into the Shuttle era. Even individual Soviet scientists had made inquiries into the possibilities of flying payloads on the U.S. Shuttle. Culbertson pointed out that, unlike earlier NASA manned space programs that included scientific funding in overall program budgets, NASA in-house Shuttle payload development was the sole responsibility of the specific NASA disciplines themselves. NASA\u2019s FY 1976 budget request contained from $50 to $100 million for various efforts that could evolve into Shuttle payloads, and the budget for FY 1977 would markedly increase payload funding. However, with the budget crunch, funding for Shuttle payloads would compete directly with other programs and the payload proposals \u201cwill have to stand on their own merit.\u201d Culbertson also said that major decisions would have to be made on how long to keep which expendable launch vehicles in the program. In another interview, NASA Spacelab Program Director Douglas R. Lord said that upcoming major decisions concerning Spacelab included a follow-on procurement plan for Spacelab hardware and priorities on how often ESRO (European Space Research Organization) and other crews and experimental hardware would fly on Shuttle\u2014 Spacelab missions. Lord said that operations of overall Spacelab functions would probably be maintained separately from payload operations: Johnson Space Center was the logical place to handle overall operations, and Marshall Space Flight Center was the leading candidate for the Spacelab payload operations center. Goddard Space Flight Center had expressed interest in handling operational needs of the high-energy experiments on Spacelab pallets.

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., ERDA Administrator said in a letter to Representative Charles A. Mosher (R\u2014Ohio). The letter was a reply to correspondence from members of the Ohio congressional delegation and Cleveland businessmen and industrialists to President Ford calling for increased use of LeRC talent to meet the nation\u2019s energy crisis. Dr. Fletcher and Dr. Seamans noted that the newly established ERDA was the lead Federal agency for managing national energy R&D. ERDA intended to use the expertise and facilities of other Federal agencies where it was feasible and in the national interest with respect to cost, timeliness, and program management. LeRC, NASA\u2019s lead center for aerospace propulsion and power, was already involved in ERDA-sponsored projects in solar heating and cooling, wind energy, and topping cycles to increase the efficiency of coal-fueled steam plants.

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said, \u201cIn an age when space research and technology was measured by its immediate value in the marketplace, studies of the planets often are considered little more than an exercise in curiosity. Nothing could be farther from the truth.\u201d When spacecraft were developed to meet the specialized needs of space travel and planetary exploration, technology was advanced. \u201cNASA cannot lay claim to the development of the electronic computer, but it can take a large credit for spurring a revolution in the electronics industry.\u201d The need for lightweight components in spacecraft led to electronic microminiaturization. The Uliac 4 computer, developed at the Univ. of Illinois for DOD and now operated jointly by DOD and NASA, could perform 300 million calculations a second and store 1 trillion bits of information at a time, more than the entire surviving output of the Greek and Roman civilizations. Operational since 1973, Illiac\u2019s speed and refinement allowed scientists to simulate and study global climate changes, study long-range effects of pollution on the atmosphere, distinguish between earth tremors from natural sources and underground nuclear blasts, develop seismic pictures of the earth\u2019s outer shell, and enhance medical x-rays so that tumors could be discovered in earliest stage of development. Illiac 4 has helped solve problems that had eluded scientists for decades. Other space technology was being used effectively to preserve and manage the earth\u2019s resources and enhance the quality of life for all its inhabitants. Communications satellites were making global communications a reality. Meteorological satellites had advanced the science of weather forecasting on land and sea. Sensors, surgical instruments, biological isolation garments, lenses, portable cardiac care systems, and eye switches were just a few examples of space technology used in the medical field. New alloys and materials developed to withstand the rigors of space were being used for longer-lasting automobile and aircraft engines; temperature-resistant lubricants and fireproof materials added to the safety of homes and buildings. \u201cThe fast-growing list of things that are and will be as a result of our venture into the cosmos is almost beyond imagination. Everyone who lives will be affected by them. And because of them, the world a decade or so hence will be quite different from the world we now know.\u201d (LeRC Release 75\u201411; Fletcher speech, text)",

During its more than 16 mo in heliocentric orbit, Mariner 10 (launched 3 Nov. 1973) had traveled more than 1.6 billion km and made four planetary encounters, one of Venus and three of Mercury. It had passed within 5800 km of Venus 5 Feb. 1974, and transmitted to earth the first closeup photographs ever taken of the cloud-shrouded planet. Mariner 10 had confirmed the high-speed circulation of Venus\u2019 upper atmosphere and revealed circulation patterns that swirled from the equator toward the poles. It had also revealed a long tail of charged particles trailing behind the planet and away from the sun; verified the presence of a bow shock wave created by the solar wind acting upon the dense atmosphere; detected hydrogen, helium, and argon in the Venusian atmosphere; and discovered temperature-inversion zones suggestive of deeper stratiform cloud layers.

The Washington Post later reported that the Soviets were committed to budding, by 1981, a 1000-mw magnetohydrodynamic plant with expected conversion efficiency of 50%. Conventional steam-turbine plants using oil or coal for fuel operate at 40% efficiency, those using nuclear fuel at 33%. (Toth, LA Times News Service, WPost, 28 March 75, A3)",

The technique involved cutting many tiny holes in the aircraft wings and applying suction from within. This would control the laminar flow of the airstream, preventing drag-producing turbulence from being created by the change in pressure as the air flows over the wing surface. In the 1960s Northrop Corp. had built the Air Force a plane incorporating the concept but technical problems had discouraged further development. Rising fuel costs and recent improvements in structural materials and manufacturing techniques had sparked new interest in the method.

Geos 3 carried an array of quartz reflectors that permitted laser ranging measurements accurate to 10 cm.

The article, based on a report by scientists at Goddard Space Flight Center, said the GSFC scientists suspected that the dust was being lifted from the lunar surface and then driven away from the rising or setting sun by electrostatic fields associated with the transition from day to night, or vice versa. The finding supported a theory advanced 20 yr ago by Dr. Thomas Gold of Cornell Univ., who had suggested that electrostatic forces transported dust from lunar highlands to lowlands, accounting for the smooth appearance of the lunar seas. Although the Apollo landings had shown that those seas had been formed by lava flooding rather than deep dust accumulations, their surface was covered with very fine dust. Also, because neither wind nor rain existed on the airless moon, some other process must have been responsible for the evident erosion. Electrostatic levitation was being suggested as one possible explanation.

Lee said at a NASA Headquarters press briefing that a number of modifications had been made on the Apollo command and service modules to accommodate the special requirements of the July U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. ASTP mission. Changes to the command module included a modified umbilical to accommodate docking-module functions, an additional TV camera and recorder for coverage of joint activities, modified controls and displays for new equipment and experiments, additional equipment for communications and TV coverage via Ats 6 (Applications Technology Satellite, launched 30 May 1974), modified stowage, added intervehicular intercom, and additional VHF-FM communications capability at the U.S.S.R. frequency. Changes in the service module included added heaters and insulation of propellant systems for solar inertial attitude, added propellant storage module for increased attitude-control and backup deorbit capability, and deletion of the unused main propellant tank. The docking module would be carried in the same position in which the lunar module had been during lunar landing missions. It would be extracted in the same manner, by separating the CSM from the booster once in orbit, turning around, and pulling out the docking module with the nose of the CSM. In response to questioning, Lee said that the U.S. cost of the ASTP mission would fall within the $245-mi]lion congressional authorization. Although the Soviets had not quoted a specific amount, Lee believed that the launch of the two unmanned Soyuz spacecraft to check out modifications made for ASTP, the launch of a manned mission, and the preparations for two complete spacecraft and crews would indicate that the Soviets were investing \u201cat least the equivalent\u201d in resources.

MIT researchers placed a titanium dioxide crystal and a piece of platinum connected by a wire into a beaker of water in which inert ionic substances were dissolved to allow an electric current to flow. The titanium dioxide and platinum acted as electrodes, establishing electrical contact with the water. When ultraviolet light from a laser illuminated the titanium dioxide, application of electrical potentials as low as 0.2 volts produced hydrogen and oxygen gases. The process thus far was inefficient, only 1% of the light energy being converted into chemical energy. Researchers were experimenting with different electrodes and reaction temperatures to find methods that would decompose water using low-energy visible light instead of high-energy ultraviolet light, which was only a small fraction of the light available from the sun. (NASA Release 75\u2014106) Dr. Michael Boretsky, Dept, of Commerce analyst, agreed, saying that the productivity decline could be attributed in part to the \u201crelative decline in-the overall rate of the United States technological advance.\u201d Since the mid-1960s, output per man-hour had been growing at half the average rate of the previous 100 yr, while productivity gains had been speeding up in other countries.

      "story": " An overactive sun and excessively bright moon had caused brief shutdowns of instruments aboard Intelsat (International Telecommunications Satellite) communications satellites, the New York Times reported. Showers of particles during solar flares on 11 March and 13 Oct. 1974 had built up excess electrical charges on satellite surfaces that had not been electrically grounded. Noise from the resulting electrical discharges confused readings of which way onboard antennas were pointing, causing the antennas to point away from the earth and temporarily cut off communications. A similar problem occurred 27 March when a spinning comsat interpreted infrared light from an exceptionally bright moon as coming from earth. Because of this, the satellite\u2019s controls were receiving an earth indication twice as often as usual, thus commanding the pointing system to compensate by despinning at twice its normal rate. Communications were blacked out because the antennas were spinning relative to the earth rather than remaining stationary and pointing toward earth. The NYT quoted Communications Satellite Corp. engineers as saying that these occurrences pointed out the need for more knowledge about the exact behavior of Intelsat satellites in space so that changes could be made in the design of future satellites. The solar-particle problem had led to more thorough electrical grounding aboard the newest Intelsat satellites. (McElheny, NYT, 1 May 75, 83)",

U.S. goals remained obscure. The mission would provide the answers to some experimented questions: Could the U.S. and U.S.S.R. work together in a joint space program? Could an international rescue capability be developed? Could the ASTP experience be expanded to future joint space ventures? That ASTP had survived to the final countdown was a tribute to the flexibility, stamina, and ingenuity of the technical working groups of both countries. A formidable series of technical, philosophical, linguistic, and operational problems had been solved and the investment by both countries had been substantial. ASTP had been \u201cpartially worth the effort.. . to have a sizable group of NASA and industry technicians get some practical hard-headed experience in working with their Soviet counterparts and acquiring a realistic view of their technical capabilities and philosophy.

The spacecraft entered near-equatorial orbit with a 523.35-km apogee, 502.18-km perigee, 94.88-min period, and 2.995° inclination. Primary objectives of the Explorer 53 mission were to measure the x-ray emission of discrete extragalactic sources, to monitor the intensity and spectra of galactic x-ray sources from 1.0 kev to 50 kev, and to monitor the x-ray intensity of the star Sco X\u2014 1. During a preliminary in-orbit checkout, controllers noticed that a stuck nutation damper was causing the spacecraft nutation, or coning, angle to be 4° rather than the planned 0.2°. Energizing the z-axis coil reduced the coning angle to 0.5°. Although the damper could not be freed despite repeated attempts, the nutation could be kept within reasonable limits so that scientific objectives could be achieved. A committee would evaluate the problem. Other spacecraft anomalies included intermittent operation of the spinning digital solar-aspect detector, and irregular and noisy operation of the spacecraft star sensor. Neither problem was expected to seriously degrade the mission. The 195-kg satellite was designed to extend and complement the capabilities of Explorer 42 (Uhuru, launched 12 Dec. 1970 as the first satellite dedicated entirely to the study of x-ray sources in space) and Explorer 48 (launched 16 Nov. 1970 to study galactic and extragalactic gamma radiation). Explorer 53, with its broad spectral range, provided higher energy resolution than previous satellites and permitted a study of physical conditions near an x-ray source. The spacecraft\u2019s quasi-three-axis stabilization system allowed much longer continuous observation of sources. Data from Explorer 53 would provide the basis for the more detailed x-ray studies to be made by High Energy Astronomy Observatories A and B scheduled for launch in 1977 and 1978. The experiment aboard Explorer 53 was designed and built by the Center for Space Research of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The spacecraft control section was designed by the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins Univ. Goddard Space Flight Center managed the program for the Office of Space Science. Langley Research Center was responsible for the Scout launch vehicle. Italy was responsible for the assembly, checkout, and launch of the Scout on a cost-reimbursable basis.

A potential new engine might be a duct-burning turbofan with features such as a variable-geometry fan that allowed the engine to move as much as possible between straight turbojet and straight turbofan operational cycles. Other objectives for future NASA-developed SST propulsion systems included a 7400-km range with outstanding economy at speeds from mach 2.2 to mach 2.7, good subsonic cruise characteristics, good hold endurance and economy, and low takeoff noise. Whitlow stressed that, because of noise limitations, future SSTs would not be straight turbojets, and SCAR researchers were concentrating on low-bypass-ratio turbofans. As bypass ratio also affects engine weight, fuel consumption, drag, and cost-effective performance, no single bypass ratio of a conventional engine could meet all desired goals simultaneously. Thus SCAR researchers were developing variable-cycle engine technology that could tailor the bypass ratio and perhaps the fan/pressure ratio for optimum performance. Candidate engines included a mini-bypass turbojet, a variable-bypass supersonic turbofan, a duct-burning turbofan, and a rear-valve variable-cycle engine.

With both Soviet and U.S. crewmen participating in simulators in their respective countries and control centers fully manned, the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft were \u201claunched\u201d and put through various maneuvers. Communications between the two control centers included voice, teletype, datafax, and TV. During the simulation, a technical problem prevented observers in Houston from hearing the two Soviet cosmonauts; NASA officials said later that that problem should not happen during a real flight. No other major problems were reported. A second simulation begun at 6:30 am CDT 15 May and continuing for 56 hr rehearsed Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous, docking, crew transfers, and undocking and final separation. A third simulation, begun at 6:30 am CDT 19 May, was cancelled when the command module simulator in Houston did not work properly. The simulation, a 9-hr rehearsal of rendezvous and docking, was successfully completed 20 May. Final simulations by Houston and Moscow control centers and crewmen were scheduled for 30 June and 1 July.

The stacked vehicle was jacked up and set on the pad; after checkout, the vehicle was rotated to the proper launch azimuth. The booster was held to the pad by four support arms which were popped out of the way by counterweights once the vehicle started to move. Stafford said that Leninsk was a new city built in a desert. The continued construction activity indicated that the Soviets \u201care not slowing down one bit in their space program.\u201d The Soviets had told their U.S. counterparts that they would continue to have several manned flights a year operating in low earth orbit.

Early reconnaissance satellites were of two types: SAMOS (satellite and missile observation system) satellites carried wide-area cameras to determine ground targets of interest; film was processed on board and imagery radioed to ground. Discoverer satellites from lower orbits used high-resolution cameras for closeups; the satellite ejected its film, which parachuted down for midair recovery by Air Force aircraft. These satellites were replaced, in the 1970s, by the 11 340-kg \u201cBig Bird\u201d spacecraft.

The new data recorder\u2014a major milestone in NASA\u2019s continuing program to develop an all-solid-state data recorder for future U. S. spacecraft\u2014was one-third the size and one-half the weight of current equipment. It was expected to use half the power and have 10 times the life expectancy of present recorders. Objective of the effort was to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating high-capacity memory elements with reasonable yield and operating margins. (Rockwell Int\u2019l Release ERD-1; LaRC proj off, interview, 18 Jan 77) 22 May\u20147 June: The U.S. and Peru launched more than 40 sounding rockets and balloons in a joint project, called Antarqui for the Inca god of flight, to study the earth\u2019s atmosphere and ionosphere from Chilca Launch Range in Peru, a location on the magnetic equator where the earth\u2019s magnetic field is horizontal. Instruments aboard the rockets and balloons measured the composition of the neutral and ionized atmosphere, density and temperature, wind shear, and turbulence. The measurements would be compared with data from Explorer 51 (Atmosphere Explorer\u2014C, launched 15 Dec. 1973) and the ground-based Jicamarca and Huancayo Observatories. Tbe overall mission included the launch of 4 Nike-Tomahawks, 8 Nike-Apaches, 7 Super Areas, and 10 Super Lokis, as well as two balloons measuring 36 m in diameter and 12 ozonesonde balloons. Project Antarqui was a continuation of a NASA sounding-rocket program conducted during the 1964\u2014 65 International Quiet Sun Year when 77 sounding rockets had been launched during the first 4 mo of 1965 from a sea-going launch platform, the USNS Croatan. Wallops Flight Center managed the program for NASA; the Instituto Geofisico del Peru arranged for the use of the range, supplied range operation and logistics support in Peru, correlated ground-based measurements from Jicamarca and Huancayo, assisted in recovery operations, and performed some preliminary work at the range. In addition to WFC, Goddard Space Flight Center, Dudley Observatory, Univ. of Pittsburgh, Univ. of 111., Penn. State Univ., Univ. of Denver, and GCA Corp. supplied scientific payloads for the sounding rockets and balloons. (WFC Release 75\u20146; NASA Activities, June 75, 14; WFC proj mgr, interviews, 11\u201412 Jan 75) 24 May\u201426 July: Tne U.S.S.R. launched Soyuz 18, carrying cosmonauts Pyotr Klimuk and Vitaly Sevastyanov, from Baykonur cosmodrome at 7:58 pm local time (10:58 amEDT). According to the Tassnews agency, the spacecraft entered orbit with a 247-km apogee, 193-km perigee, 88.6-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass announced that the purpose of the mission was \u201cto conduct further experiments with the orbital research station \u2018Salyut\u20144,\u2019 started on January 12, during the joint flight of the delivery spaceship \u2018Soyuz\u201417\u2019 and the station \u2018Salyut\u20144\u2019 as well as to test individual elements and systems of the spaceship in various modes of flight.\u201d During the first day in orbit Klimuk and Sevastyanov checked out essential spacecraft and life-support systems and prepared for orbital maneuvering. The crew switched on the main engines twice on 25 May to raise the spacecraft\u2019s orbit in preparation for rendezvous and docking with Salyut 4. On 26 May Soyuz 18 approached the station by an automatic control system. At a distance of 100 km the crew took over control and manually docked the spacecraft with the Salyut 4 station in pitch darkness. After docking, the crew switched on the station\u2019s lights and began activation and checkout of the onboard systems. The crew transferred equipment and boarded the station where they found a \u201cWelcome to our common home\u201d sign left by the station\u2019s previous tenants, Soyuz 17 cosmonauts Aleksey Gubarev and Georgy Grechko. The cosmonauts reported that all systems were operating normally and that they themselves were in good health. By 28 May the station and spacecraft were in an orbit with a 349-km apogee, 338-km perigee, 91.4-min period, and 51.6° inclination. During their 63 days in orbit, the cosmonauts studied the sun, planets, and stars in various bands of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation using several x-ray telescopes, including one called \u201cFilin\u201d; investigated geological-morphological objects on the earth\u2019s surface, photographing the U.S.S.R. in the medium and southern latitudes; studied physical processes in the earth\u2019s atmosphere and in space; performed medical and biological research with particular emphasis on the impact of weightlessness on the human organism; and tested the station\u2019s design and onboard systems. The cosmonauts also raised a garden of onions and peas as a forerunner of providing self-sufficient food supplies in space. Tass reported that, for the first time during a space flight, the polar fights were investigated using integral photography and spectrography methods. Twice during the mission Klimuk and Sevastyanov spoke with cosmonauts Aleksey A. Leonov and Valery N. Kubasov who were also in orbit participating in the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project begun 15 July. By 23 July the cosmonauts were preparing the space station for automatic operation. On 26 July at 3:56 pm Baykonur time (6:56 am EDT), Soyuz 18 and its crew undocked from Salyut 4. They softlanded 56 km northeast of Arkalyk in Kazakhstan at 7:18 pm Baykonur time (10:18 am EDT). ' Tass reported that by 27 July the cosmonauts\u2019 slight pulse and blood pressure fluctuations noted immediately after landing had returned to normal. Decreases in erythrocytes and increases in leucocytes disappeared after a few days, and in 1 or 2 wk orthostatic stability and resistance to functional tests had almost reached preflight baselines. Both Klimuk and Sevastyanov had lost some weight\u20143.8 kilograms and 1.9 kilograms respectively\u2014during the mission. The Soyuz 18 crew\u2019s 62-day 23-hr 40-min mission broke the previous 29-day 13-hr 20-min Soviet record for time in space set by the Soyuz 17. The current world\u2019s record for time in space was held by the Skylab 4 astronauts for their 84-day 1-hr 16-min mission, 16 Nov. 1973 to 8 Feb. 1974. Salyut 4, which had been visited by the two crews of Soyuz 17 and 18, was the fourth space station orbited by the U.S.S.R. Salyut 1 had been launched 19 April 1971. A three-man crew, launched on Soyuz 10, docked with the station on 24 April but returned to earth without entering. The Soyuz 11 crew, launched 6 June 1971, boarded the station and conducted experiments for 24 days but were killed during a reentry accident. Salyut 2 was launched 3 April 1973 but an explosion of wildly firing thrusters sent the station out of control, tearing off the solar panels and making the station uninhabitable. Salyut 3 was orbited 25 June 1974 and a two-man crew, carried by Soyuz 14, lived and worked aboard the station from 3\u201419 July 1974. A second crew, launched 26 Aug. 1974, returned to earth in 48 hr after an unsuccessful attempt to dock with the station, which itself reentered the earth\u2019s atmosphere 26 Sept. 1974.

In addition, data were gathered to calibrate the vehicle\u2019s air data probes. The model, built by Shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International Corp., was 13.1 m long and weighed 20 400 kg. Additional wind-tunnel tests were scheduled for November 1975 and February 1976. (4-Strogram, 5 June 75, 1; Young, JSC aerodynamic subsystems mgr, interview, 21 April 77) In a speech, Secretary General of the International Telecommunications Union M. Mili said ITU encouraged Europe\u2019s intention to play an important role in the peaceful uses of outer space; the programs of ESRO\u2014ESA offered a particularly well chosen range of satellites for research and applications. Y. Demerliac, Secretary General of Eurospace\u2014Groupement In-dustriel Europeen D\u2019Etudes Spatiales\u2014reminded the audience that since 1962 Europe had developed 43 satellites, including four communications satellites. In addition, European industry had built 36 of the 104 ground stations or antennas in the network of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT). More than two-thirds of these had been sold to non-European countries. Director General of ESRO Roy Gibson (United Kingdom) said the creation of ESA was of more significance than a mere change in name: the convention of the new agency gave it a specific mandate to work toward a rationalization of Europe\u2019s space program which its predecessors ESRO and ELDO (European Launcher Development Organization) did not have. He hoped that the 3-day presentation of ESRO\u2014 ESA and other European programs would give the visitors an impression of the total competence and capability of Europe\u2019s up-to-date, rather dispersed space effort.

The radiation seemed to consist of atomic nuclei heavier than hydrogen which, when stripped of electrons, would carry multiple positive electric charges. The astronauts had seen the flashes when the spacecraft cabin was dark and they were preparing for sleep. Scientists suspected that the flashes were stimulated within the retina of the eye by the high-energy cosmic-ray particles. Normally earth was shielded from cosmic rays by the magnetic field, but strong penetrating cosmic rays could reach as far into the field as the Skylab orbit. Because the magnetic-field shielding of the earth weakened toward the geomagnetic poles, it was possible to predict variations in cosmic-ray exposure as Skylab moved away from the poles. During two test periods, light-flash observations of Astronaut William R. Pogue showed a close correlation with exposure variations.

The series of five night flights was designed by NASA and European Space Agency representatives to permit Spacelab mission planners to evaluate experiment techniques and operations. The simulations, part of a study program called the Airborne Science Spacelab Experiments System Simulation (ASSESS), would provide valuable information on the interaction between scientific investigators on the ground and experiment operators aboard Spacelab and would aid in estimating the training needed by Spacelab experiment operators.

Explorer 49's lunar orbit, away from the noisy environment of earth, had increased the effectiveness of the instrumentation. The spacecraft had been able to detect very weak solar-noise bursts up to 13 mhz and as low as 25 khz. Its predecessor, Explorer 38\u2014Radio Astronomy Explorer A, launched 4 July 1968\u2014had been able to observe relatively intense solar-noise bursts only in the 200 khz to 9 mhz range because of its orbit within the earth\u2019s magnetosphere. Explorer 49 also was able to observe and follow solar bursts out of the ecliptic plane. Data from Explorer 49 had verified two major magneto spheric noise regions, one on the morning side of the earth and the other on the evening side. In addition, spacecraft data showed that intense noise occurred in the 8 to 12 pm time zone with less intense noise in midmoming. The intense late-evening noise was generated within 10 000 to 12 000 km of the earth\u2019s surface, and the dayside emission seemed to come from an altitude of less than 4000 km. (NASA MOR, 3 June 75) 3- 6 June: A Kennedy Space Center team tested a parachute system designed to lower an instrumented probe through the dense atmosphere of Venus to its surface. The tests\u2014made for Ames Research Center in preparation for a Pioneer mission to Venus in 1978\u2014were conducted in KSC\u2019s Vehicle Assembly Building, an ideal wind-free testing facility. Full-scale 3.7-m parachutes with simulated pressure vessels weighing 204 kg were dropped 13 times from heights of up to 137 m to the floor of the VAB with impact cushioned by a honeycomb cardboard impact arrester. The performance of the parachute system was monitored photographically during the drop to determine the aerodynamic trim characteristics of the parachute. The 1978 Pioneer\u2014Venus.mission would include the launch of two separate spacecraft toward Venus. The first would orbit the planet collecting data for about 250 days; the second would carry one large probe, which would use the parachute to descend to the surface, and three small probes decelerated by aerodynamic drag only. The parachute on the largest probe would be used to separate an instrumentbearing pressure vessel and stabilize it for a series of critical scientific measurements as it passed through the Venusian cloud layer. None of the probes was designed to communicate with earth after impact.

Greenberg said in a Washington Post article. Greenberg pointed out that the President already had National Science Foundation Director Dr. H.

Although Dr. Stever possessed all the right qualifications and was eager to serve, \u201cMr. Ford has had more conversations with golf pros over the years than he has had with Mr. Stever.\u201d The science community had agitated for the return of a science adviser by appealing to Congress and appointing committees of distinguished scientists who duly certified that the President suffered from the absence of a science adviser close at hand. Although President Ford decided in favor of the appointment, still unresolved was whether a science office would be more useful than the NSF-based operation. Past Presidents had not often used their science advice. \u201cThe bookshelves of the Executive Office Building bear innumerable aging reports of early warnings by scientists concerning problems of energy, food, resources, pesticides, pollution, drug safety, and so forth, but few [Presidents] chose to listen.\u201d Science advice was a valuable resource for a President who chose to employ it, \u201cfor as grating as they often are with their contentions of superior wisdom, scientists do possess experience and talent that can Be put to good political use.\u201d President Ford\u2019s move had little significance as far as the Ford administration was concerned, and it would \u201cadd up to nothing more than a cosmetic device\u201d if the new science office had no jurisdiction over military research and development, a function sliced away from the advisory role under President Nixon\u2019s reorganization. \u201cBut if a science office is in place at the White House, the next administration can get good service from it if it chooses to do so.

Aldrich, deputy manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at JSC, said that the most extensive modification required for the ASTP mission was redesigning the Soyuz spacecraft to accommodate the newly added docking system. The front end of the Soyuz had been modified with respect to structural configuration, thermal design, and the requirement to fit all the new system under the launch shroud that covered the entire Soyuz during the boost phase.

      "story": " NASA launched Nimbus 6 on a thrust-augmented Thor-Delta booster from the Western Test Range at 1:12 am PDT after a 6-min delay to clear a ship from the jettison trajectory of the Delta\u2019s solid rockets. The spacecraft entered sun-synchronous polar orbit with a 1103-km apogee, 1094-km perigee, 107-min period, and 99.96° inclination. Separation of the spacecraft from the launch vehicle was normal, at 59 min into the flight. The solar panels were deployed and the attitude-control system quickly acquired earth. A wheel control provided three-axis stabilization. Checkout of the power system, telemetry, command links, and tape recorder was completed on the first day of operation. At 7 hr after launch, a cryogenic vent valve associated with the limb-radiance inversion radiometer was pyrotechnically actuated as planned. This caused unexpected high torques and excessive control-gas usage. Nimbus 6 was put into a safe wideband gravity-gradient mode to conserve gas, and an investigation was begun to find the cause of the problem and determine possible remedies. By 24 June the 9 experiments and all spacecraft systems had been checked out and all instrumentation, except for 2 tape recorders, was working normally. The primary objective of the Nimbus 6 mission was to contribute to the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) by refining and extending the capability of vertically sounding the temperature and moisture of the atmosphere, with particular regard to altitude resolution and interference effects of clouds. GARP, a cooperative worldwide weather program, was established to improve understanding of meteorological atmospheric processes in the tropics and to improve observation and computing systems for weather prediction and analysis. Nimbus 6 would also monitor environmental conditions such as sea ice and rainfall and would measure the earth\u2019s radiation budget with a precision never before attained. Secondary objective of the mission was to demonstrate the ability to track and relay data from a low-altitude polar-orbiting spacecraft using a geosynchronous satellite as a communications relay. Ats 6, the Applications Technology Satellite launched on 30 May 1974, would be the relay comsat. A data-collection, processing, and relay-to-earth system was also on board to collect data from approximately 300 balloon-borne platforms, designed to float at an altitude of 20 km, and a large number of earth- and sea-based data platforms. Nimbus 6, unlike previous spacecraft, could receive and process up to eight incoming signals at a time. The satellite carried nine new instruments to extend measurements of atmospheric parameters to significantly higher altitudes than had previously been possible: the tracking and data-relay (T&DR) experiment; a high-resolution temperature sounder (HIRS) and a scanning microwave spectrometer (SCAMS) to take temperature soundings in the atmosphere outside the tropics; a tropical wind-energy conversion and reference level experiment (TWERLE) to provide data on tropical areas; a limb-radiance inversion radiometer (LRIR) and a pressure-modulated radiometer (PMR) to provide high-altitude temperature soundings; an earth radiation budget (ERR) experiment to establish the earth\u2019s atmospheric radiation balance; an electrically scanning microwave radiometer (ESMR) to map the liquid-water content of the clouds, ocean rainfall,, and distribution and variation of sea-ice cover; and a temperature/humidity infrared radiometer (THIR) to provide data on cloud cover, ground temperatures, and water-vapor distribution. Nimbus 6 was next to last in a planned series of seven experimental meteorological satellites. Nimbus 1 (launched 28 Aug. 1964) and Nimbus 2 (launched 15 May 1966) achieved all their objectives. Launch of the third Nimbus, on 19 May 1968, failed when the launch vehicle malfunctioned; an identical spacecraft launched 14 April 1969 successfully functioned as Nimbus 3. Nimbus 4 and 5 (launched 8 April 1970 and 10 Dec. 1972) had both completed all mission objectives and were still operating. General Electric Co. was the prime contractor responsible for Nimbus 6 integration and test, stabilization control, control-subsystem integration, and spacecraft structures and antennas. Seven U.S. and two British companies, in addition to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, provided the nine instruments. Goddard Space Flight Center managed the Nimbus program under the direction of the NASA Office of Applications and was also responsible for the Thor-Delta launch vehicle.

Kramer, NASA Director of Planetary Programs, said at a Viking news conference in Washington, D.C. The Lander would remain in the oven for 2.5 days and then be removed and checked out. Past missions had failed because \u201cmaybe we knew how to sterilize a spacecraft but we didn\u2019t know how to make one work after it was sterilized,\u201d Kramer said. However, \u201cwe think we know a lot more now than we did 15 years ago. We believe we have developed the techniques to be fully reliable, but when we complete that test along about next Tuesday morning, then we are going to find out for sure.\u201d A. Thomas Young, Viking Mission Operations Manager at Langley Research Center, said that plans called for launch of Viking 1 on 11 Aug. and launch of Viking 2 on 21 Aug. Mission planners had deliberately arranged for the first Viking to arrive at Mars on 18 June 1976, after 10 mos of travel, and Viking 2 to arrive on 7 Aug. 1976, about 1 yr after it was launched. Both spacecraft would spend about 17 days in orbit examining landing sites \u201cto assure ourselves that they continue to be safe.\u201d The sites, which had not been examined since 1971, must be checked again because Mars was a dynamic planet. Lander 1 was scheduled to begin its descent 4 July and start black-and-white photography immediately upon landing. Color photography would begin 18 hr later. The first soil sample would be collected on the eighth day. Analysis of the sample would take 12 days to complete, and 20 days would be required to complete one cycle of all surface science. Young noted that, to avoid confusion during the mission, Martian days would be called \u201csols\u201d because they were a half-hour longer than earth days. During surface operations, the Orbiter passing overhead once a day would remain synchronized with the Lander; on the pass, the Orbiter, acting as a communications satellite, would relay information from the Lander to earth. When the Lander completed its work, the Orbiter would perform observations of its own, studying Martian surface features, including the proposed Lander B landing site, from orbit. (Transcript)",

O\u2019Keefe, a Goddard Space Flight Center scientist, and Professor Harold C. Urey, Nobel Prize winner from the Univ. of California. The paper, presented by Dr. O\u2019Keefe at a meeting of the Royal Society in London, stated that although the moon had little, if any, metallic core, data from Apollo lunar-landing missions and earlier unmanned lunar flights had provided chemical evidence that lunar rocks were once a part of a mass that had included a considerable portion of molten iron. The higher proportion of molten metal in the earth supported the theory that, before the split, the iron in the earth had sunk to the center, drawing with it the gold, platinum, and other rare metals found in molten rock originally mixed with the iron. According to the theory, the moon was pushed to its present distance from the earth by interaction with the tides of the body of the earth. Other theories about the formation of the moon included the possibility that the moon had been captured by the earth\u2019s gravitational field when it passed near the earth, or that it had been formed simultaneously with the earth. Neither of those theories explained the moon\u2019s lack of a substantial metallic core. (NASA Release 75\u2014171)",

Dr. Goldstein scanned Ganymede three or four times on each of six nights in August 1974, using the 64-m antenna at JPL\u2019s Goldstone station of the Deep Space Network; the radar employed a 400-kw microwave beam at a frequency of 12.6 cm. Writing in Science magazine, Dr. Goldstein and co-investigator George A. Morris said the most likely surface of Ganymede was rocky metallic material imbedded in a matrix of ice. Such a surface could be smooth with a top layer of ice rubble but would appear rough to the radar because the ice would be transparent to the microwave beam. The theory was particularly interesting in view of the finding by the Pioneer 10 and 11 flybys (3 Dec. 1973 and 3 Dec. 1974) that Jupiter itself seemed totally gaseous, with no solid surface to produce a radar echo.

President Joseph V. Charyk as saying. In less than 10 yr a global comsat system developed under U.S. leadership was carrying more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s transocean communications. Canada had had its own since 1972. The problem, Charyk said, was that, after the success of the global system, \u201ceverybody wanted in.\u201d Companies, including American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Western Union Telegraph Co., Hughes Aircraft Co., RCA Corp., and Fairchild Industries, Inc., expressed interest in developing a domestic system. The Federal Communications Commission, whose job it was to decide who would operate such a system, seemed only intent upon keeping ComSatCorp and AT&T from dominating the field. Quoting Charyk, the Star said the net effect of this lack of a positive policy by the White House, Congress, and the regulatory agencies was that all the U.S. had to date were two or three earth stations using reproductions of the Canadian system. Despite the problems, Charyk said that two of ComSatCorp\u2019s domestic programs were nearing operational stages: Marisat, a maritime comsat planned for a summer 1975 launch, and Comstar 1, scheduled for launch in 1976. ComSatCorp would also participate with several European countries and Canada in the Aerosat program to test the use of comsats for aircraft navigation. However, Charyk said that, under the \u201copen skies\u201d policies of the FCC , ComSatCorp had no guarantees of permanent service. \u201cIt is hard to get customers with these rules in effect.\u201d (Snider, WStar, 20 June 75, D7)",

      "story": " A Science magazine article detailed some early findings from the Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) of the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP). GATE, a 72-nation research effort during the summer of 1974 to gather meteorological information on the tropics, found very few cumulus clouds. Clouds in weather disturbances tended to be grouped in patterns, usually in roughly linear bands. Prior to GATE the only visible indicators of these weather-disturbance patterns were cloud clusters seen on satellite photographs, but the details were unknown; GATE demonstrated that these clusters were high cirrus clouds that formed above the weather disturbance and might persist long after the rainclouds themselves had dissipated. The organization of active rainclouds then came under intensive study as the essential feature of atmospheric convection. Although scientists had previously thought that cloud bases formed at a given level in the atmosphere, clouds in the GATE area were found to form at many different altitudes; many did not reach the heights often associated with tropical cumulus clouds until the latter part of the summer. The strength of weather disturbances intensified during the experiment, indicating that the tropical atmosphere probably altered over the course of the summer as its moisture content and convection increased, causing the clouds to grow taller as higher and higher levels of the atmosphere were warmed. GATE scientists also investigated the air layer between the cloud bases and the sea surface, finding that the subcloud layer was profoundly altered by the passage of a cloud. Warm moist air taken up into the cloud to fuel the convection was replaced by cooler drier air from higher in the atmosphere. Scientists believed that the resulting mix might explain cloud spacing and lifetime, and might indicate a continually changing subcloud layer in marked contrast to conditions prevailing in fair weather. GATE experiments documented the existence of atmospheric waves in the tropics and showed that weather disturbances developed near the low-pressure portion of the wave. Scientists also discovered a peculiar rapid meandering of the equatorial undercurrent\u2014an intense eastward flowing stream 100 m below the sea surface at the equator\u2014that shifted north and south about 1° in latitude on either side of the equator with an apparent period of 16 days.

      "story": " NASA successfully launched Oso 8 Orbiting Solar Observatory at 7:43 am EDT from Eastern Test Range on a thrust-augmented Thor-Delta booster, after a 1-day delay because of an electrical malfunction in the launch vehicle. The spacecraft entered a near-perfect circular orbit with a 560-km apogee, 544-km perigee, 95.74-min period, and 32.94° inclination. By 23 June Oso 8 was stabilized and was accurately tracking the center of the sun as planned. All spacecraft systems were operating normally. By 27 June all eight experiments had been activated and were acquiring data. Primary objective of the Oso 8 mission was to investigate the sun\u2019s lower corona and its chromosphere, and their interface in the ultraviolet spectral region, to better understand the transport of energy from the photosphere into the corona. Secondary objective was to study solar x-rays and earth-sun relationships and to investigate the background component of cosmic x-rays. The 1064-kg spacecraft had two sections: A rotating cylindrical bottom section\u2014the wheel\u2014accommodated experiments that did not require solar reference pointing or that scanned the celestial sphere. The nonspinning rectangular sail section mounted on top of the wheel accommodated experiments that required stable pointing at the sun. The spacecraft carried eight experiments. The two on the sail section were a Univ. of Colo, high-resolution ultraviolet spectrometer to measure solar-ultraviolet line profiles in the range of 1050 to 2300 A and their variation with time and position, and a spectrometer and a Cassegrain telescope that would observe the solar chromospheric structure simultaneously in six lines from 1000 to 4000 A originating from different levels in the sun\u2019s atmosphere. This experiment was provided by France\u2019s Laboratory for Stellar and Planetary Physics under a cooperative agreement between NASA and the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. Other experiments\u2014all on the wheel portion of the spacecraft and supplied by U.S. universities, industry, and government agencies\u2014 included a high-sensitivity crystal spectrometer to monitor the sun\u2019s emission in the 2- to 8-kev range, obtain a complete spectrum of the sun every 10 sec during flares, and obtain high-resolution spectra of many celestial x-ray sources; a mapping x-ray heliometer to measure location, spectrum, and intensity of intermediate-energy x-rays from individual solar-active regions and to acquire data on extrasolar x-ray sources; an investigation of soft x-ray background radiation using proportional counters; a cosmic x-ray spectroscope to determine the spectra of sources and the diffuse cosmic x-ray background in the energy range of 2 to 60 kev, and to measure intensity variations and identify possible emission lines of discrete x-ray sources; a high-energy celestial x-ray experiment to measure the spectrum of all point x-ray sources observable in the energy range of 0.01 to 1 megaelectron volts, and to search for temporal variations in the intensity and spectrum of the point sources detected; and a study of extreme ultraviolet radiations from earth and space, to determine the behavior of atoms such as hydrogen and neutral and ionized helium in the earth\u2019s atmosphere by measuring the intensity and distribution of solar radiation resonantly scattered by these atoms. Oso 8 was the ninth, and last, in a series of spin-stabilized orbiting solar observatories designed to gather new knowledge of the sun, the earth\u2019s atmosphere, and sun-activated terrestrial phenomena over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum not detectable by ground-based equipment. Of the eight OSO launches that began with Oso 1 on 7 March 1962, only one, OSO\u2014C, was unsuccessful, because of a launch-vehicle failure. Discoveries made by OSO spacecraft included gamma-ray emissions from the galactic center; a previously unknown isothermal plateau in the chromosphere of the solar atmosphere; differences in the structure of the extreme ultraviolet corona above quiet and active regions on the solar disk; evidence that the corona above the solar poles was significantly cooler than nonactive coronal regions near the equator; and synoptic observations of \u201choles\u201d in the corona that survived several solar rotations.

Whereas conventional laser power used various processes of energy conversion that required costly equipment and resulted in net loss of energy, a nuclear system could produce large amounts of high-grade power very cheaply and efficiently. Some scientists were using various nuclear-powered lasers for experiments, but most used systems that transferred energy from external reactors to the laser gas within the laser tube. NASA with its interest in gaseous fuel reactors as high-performance space power and propulsion systems, was looking at a more efficient system in which the fission fragments that energize laser gas were energized within the laser tube itself creating, at fission, a powerful chain reaction. Dr. Thom said that, in combination with the research on nuclear-pumped lasers, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory scientists were testing gaseous fuel reactors using components, reflectors, and controls salvaged from the nuclear rocket program.

The center had been formally dedicated at a ceremony 8 Sept. 1960 attended by President Dwight D. Eisenhower; Dr. T. Keith Glennan, NASA Administrator; Alabama Governor John Patterson; MSFC Director Dr. Wemher von Braun; and Mrs. George C. Marshall, widow of the statesman, soldier, and Nobel Peace Prize winner for whom the center was named. With the transfer had gone responsibility for continued development of the Redstone and the Saturn I; soon to come would be the Saturn IY and Y launch vehicles that would carry U.S. astronauts into earth orbit and, eventually, to the moon. More than 100 000 employees in 12 000 companies across the U.S. worked during the peak of developing the Saturn family and its 31 launches with 100% launch success rate. MSFC developed the Lunar Roving Vehicle that carried moon-based astronauts several km from the landing site across rugged lunar terrain. MSFC was also responsible for the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop. Launched into earth orbit 14 May 1973, Skylab 1 carried other MSFC developments including solar-observation instruments, the docking adapter, and many experiments. Three three-man crews occupied the space station for a total of 171 days. To date, as the last Saturn booster was preparing to carry three U.S. astronauts to an earth-orbital rendezvous with two Soviet cosmonauts for the joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, MSFC was heavily involved in development of the Space Transportation System, including the Space Shuttle, Space Tug, Spacelab, and related payloads. MSFC employees were also working on the development of solar heating and cooling systems and other applications projects. In a message to MSFC Director Dr. William P. Lucas, President Gerald R. Ford said that \u201cFrom its inception, the Marshall center has continued in the forefront of this Nation\u2019s tremendous advancement in the exploration of space. We look forward to more vital contributions . . . from the Marshall center in the years ahead as the United States continues to lead the way in using space for the benefit of all mankind.\u201d (MSFC Releases 75\u2014131, 75\u2014140; Historical Origins of The George C.

In the flywheel concept, electric motor generators would spin up specially constructed flywheels which kinetically stored energy by their rotation. When electrical power was needed, the rapidly spinning flywheels would drive generators. A significant application of the flywheel would be to store energy for electric utility companies; the flywheels, spun up during off-peak hours, would drive power-producing generators during peak-demand periods.

John V. Tunney (D\u2014Calif.) said in a letter to Sen. William Proxmire (D\u2014Wise.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The House recommended the delay to permit a budget decision in 1977 between the Large Space Telescope and the Pioneer\u2014Venus mission. Sen. Tunney\u2019s letter said that the probe was timed for the 1978 launch window when earth and Venus would be in unusually favorable relative positions; the next favorable window would not appear for almost 2 yr, during 1980, and Venus would be considerably further away from the earth at that time than it would be during 1978. A delay in funding would postpone the program for at least 18 mo, would require design changes, and might cost $50 million more than original estimates. Sen. Tunney said that the case for continued funding was a strong one. Most scientists felt that investigation of the Venusian atmosphere would provide valuable meteorological information that might substantially enhance weather-prediction capabilities. Another reason for continuation of the program is that, in an era of high unemployment, few sectors had suffered more devastating setbacks than the aerospace industry. The Pioneer\u2014Venus program had created more than 1500jobs, which would be threatened by termination or delay of the program. Curtailment of an ongoing scientific concept like Pioneer\u2014Venus would severely reduce credibility of the government\u2019s long-term commitments, with added time, difficulty, and cost for future projects as private contractors would seek to protect themselves. Sen. Tunney pointed out that the House\u2019s juxtaposition of funding for Pioneer\u2014Venus with funding for the Large Space Telescope was inappropriate; the programs were not competing, but complementary. Pioneer\u2014Venus would provide information on our closest neighbor, whereas LST would collect deep-space data of unprecedented scope and detail. \u201cCutting one program for the sake of the other would mean sacrificing a distinguishable body of scientific knowledge which would not be replaceable.\u201d (Text, letter, Tunney to Proxmire, 9 July 75; CR, 26 July 75, S13882\u2014 83)",

In a flight program beginning in 1963 and ending in 1972, the three versions of tbe M\u20142 vehicle had demonstrated that a manned reentry vehicle could reenter from space, maneuver through the atmosphere, and safely make a deadstick landing. M2\u2014F3 was the thjrd version of Ames Research Center\u2019s M\u20142 lifting-body design. The first, M2\u2014FI, was a lightweight plywood glider towed to altitude by a C-47 and released, whereupon the pilot guided the craft to a landing. A heavier version, M2\u2014F2, was launched from underneath the wing of a B\u2014 52 aircraft. After nearly a year of testing the unpowered vehicle, an XRL\u201411 rocket engine was installed in preparation for rocket-powered flight; on the second glide flight after engine installation, the vehicle crashed, badly damaging the vehicle and injuring the pilot. The lifting body was rebuilt, incorporating modifications, and designated M2\u2014F3. The M2\u2014F3 made more than 37 glide and powered flights with a jet reaction-control system that successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using a single system from orbit to landing. A lifting body design that had been considered for the reentry vehicle in the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs was rejected in favor of a ballistic reentry design. The use by Space Shuttle of the maneuver-to-a-deadstick-landing concept was possible largely because of the confidence level built up by 9 yr of lifting-body flight tests.

Afew minutes later Brand reported, \u201cWe\u2019ve got Soyuz in the sextant.\u201d Voice contact was made soon after. \u201cHello. Soyuz, Apollo,\u201d Stafford said in Russian. Kubasov replied in English, \u201cHello everybody. Hi to you, Tom and Deke. Hello there, Vance.\u201d All communications among the five crew members during the mission were made in the language of the listener, with the Americans speaking Russian to the Soviet crew and the Soviet crew speaking English to the Americans. Contact of the two spacecraft 51 hr 49 min into the mission (12:09 pm 17 July) was transmitted live on TV to the earth, and Stafford commented, \u201cWe have succeeded. Everything is excellent.\u201d \u201cSoyuz and Apollo are shaking hands now,\u201d the cosmonauts answered. Hard docking was completed over the Atlantic Ocean at 12:12 pm\u20146 min earlier than the prelaunch flight plan\u2014watched by millions of TV viewers worldwide. \u201cPerfect. Beautiful. Well done, Tom. It was a good show. We\u2019re looking forward to shaking hands with you in board [sic] Soyuz,\u201d Leonov said. Ta9s later reported that Kubasov told Moscow ground controllers that \u201cwe felt a slight jolt at the moment of docking\u201d but that all went according to plan. Joint Activities: At 3:17 pm hatch 3 opened; Apollo commander Stafford and Soyuz commander Leonov shook hands 2 min later. \u201cGlad to see you,\u201d Stafford told Leonov in Russian. \u201cGlad to see you. Very very happy to see you,\u201d Leonov responded in English. \u201cThis is Soyuz and the United States,\u201d Slayton told TV viewers around the world. Both Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev and President Ford congratulated the crews and expressed their confidence in the success of the mission. Stafford then presented Leonov with \u201cfive flags for your government and the people of the Soviet Union\u201d with the wish that \u201cour joint work in space serves for the benefit of all countries and peoples on the earth.\u201d Leonov presented the U.S. crew with Soviet flags and plaques. The men signed international certificates and exchanged other commemorative items. After nearly 4 hr of joint activities, including a meal aboard the Soyuz, the Americans returned to the Apollo and the hatch was closed at 6:51 pm. An integrity check of the hatches indicated an atmospheric leak on the Soviet side. Ground controllers later attributed the indication to temperature changes in the sealed docking module that were detected by the sensitive Soviet instrumentation. Future integrity checks of the hatches would be more rigorous, however. Following a sleep period, the crews prepared for another day of joint activity. Kubasov described the mission to Soviet TV viewers while the rest of the crews performed experiments in their respective spacecraft. At 5:05 am 18 July Brand entered the Soviet spacecraft; Leonov joined Stafford and Slayton in Apollo, greeting them with \u201cHowdy partner.\u201d Kubasov gave American TV viewers a tour of his Soyuz, and Stafford followed with a tour of the Apollo. Then both Kubasov and Brand videotaped scientific demonstrations for transmission to earth later. Kubasov and Brand ate lunch in the Soyuz while Leonov ate with Stafford and Slayton in Apollo. During a third transfer, Stafford and Leonov went into the Soyuz and Kubasov and Brand joined Slayton in Apollo. Brand gave Soviet viewers a Russian-language tour of the eastern U.S. as seen from space. Further speeches and exchanges of commemorative items were made for both U.S. and Soviet viewers before the final handshakes at 4:49 pm EDT 18 July, when the crews returned to their respective spacecraft. The hatches were closed after Brand told Leonov and Kubasov, \u201cWe wish you the best of success. I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ve opened up a new era in history. Our next meeting will be on the ground.\u201d Total time for all transfers and joint activities was 19 hr 55 min. Stafford had spent 7 hr 10 min aboard Soyuz; Brand, 6 hr 30 min; Slayton, 1 hr 35 min. Leonov spent 5 hr 43 min in the Apollo, Kubasov 4 hr 57 min. During nearly 2 days of joint activities, the five men carried out five joint experiments. Undocking and Separation: The Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft undocked at 95:42 GET (8:02 am EDT 19 July). While the spacecraft were in station-keeping mode, the crews photographed them and the docking apparatus, transmitting the pictures live on TV to earth. The Apollo spacecraft then served as an occulting disk, blocking the sun from the Soyuz and simulating a solar eclipse\u2014the first man-made eclipse. Leonov and Kubasov photographed the solar corona as the Apollo backed away from the Soyuz and toward the sun. The two spacecraft then redocked at 8:34 am EDT with the Apollo maneuvering and the Soyuz docking system active while good quality TV was transmitted to earth. The second docking was not as smooth as the first because a slight misalignment of the two spacecraft caused both to pitch excessively at contact. Final undocking\u2014also with the Soyuz active\u2014went smoothly and was completed at 11:26 am. As the spacecraft separated, the two crews performed the ultraviolet atmospheric absorption experiment, making unsuccessful data measurements at 150 m and then moving to a distance of 500 and 1000 m, where data were successfully collected. The Apollo maneuvered to within 50 m of Soyuz and took intensive still photography of the Soyuz. Separation maneuvers to put the two spacecraft on separate trajectories began at 2:42 pm with a reaction-control system burn. With the maneuvers completed, Leonov told the Apollo crew, \u201cThank you very much for your very big job. ... It was a very good show.\u201d Brand answered, \u201cThank you, also. This was a very good job.\u201d Soyuz Orbit and Landing-. Soyuz 19 remained in orbit nearly 30 hrs after the undocking. The cosmonauts conducted biological experiments with microorganisms and zone-forming fungi. At 2:39 am EDT 21 July the Soyuz crew closed hatch 5 between their orbital vehicle and descent module and began depressurizing the orbital module. Braking burns of the descent engines began at 6:06 am when the spacecraft was 772 km from the Apollo. The 194.9-sec bum slowed the spacecraft to 120 km per sec. After another burn to stabilize the spacecraft, the orbital and descent modules separated over Central Africa. While Soviet viewers watched the first landing of a Soviet spacecraft televised in real time, the main parachute deployed at 7 km and jettisoned before the soft-landing engines fired. Soyuz 19 landed about 11 km from the target point northeast of Baykonur Cosmodrome at 6:51 am EDT 21 July, after a 142-hr 31-min mission. The rescue helicopter approached the capsule immediately and specialists opened hatch 5. Kubasov stepped out waving to rescue-team members, followed by Leonov, both cosmonauts in apparent good health and spirits. The cosmonauts returned to Baykonur for medical checks and debriefings. Apollo Postdocking Orbital Activities: Apollo remained in orbit while its crew continued U.S. science experiments begun during predocking. Searching for extreme ultraviolet radiation, the ASTP crew marked the birth of a new branch of astronomy when they found, for the first time, extreme ultraviolet sources outside the solar system; some scientists had believed that such sources could never be found. One of the newly discovered sources turned out to be the hottest known white dwarf star. The Apollo detector also revealed the existence of the first pulsar discovered outside the Milky Way. About 200 000 light years from earth\u2019s galaxy, in the Small Magellanic Cloud, it was the most luminous pulsar known to astronomers, 10 times brighter than any discovered so far. After repairing some malfunctioning equipment, the astronauts also mapped x-ray sources throughout the Milky Way. The crew completed nearly all the 110 earth-observation tasks assigned. Coordinated investigations had been made simultaneously by six groups of scientists on the ground, on ships at sea, and in aircraft. The astronauts looked at ocean currents, ocean pollution, desert geography, shoreline erosion, volcanoes, iceberg movements, and vegetation patterns. On 23 July the command-module tunnel was vented and the crew put on spacesuits to jettison the docking module. The command and service module undocked from the DM at 3:45 pm EDT, and a 1-sec engine firing put the CSM into a higher orbit (232.2-km apogee, 219.0km perigee) so that the DM could move ahead. A second maneuver put the CSM in a 223.2-km by 219.0-km orbit. Deorbit began at 4:38 p.m. The command module and service module separated, the drogue and main parachutes deployed normally, and the Apollo splashed down at 224:58 GET (5:18 p.m. EDT 24 July) in the Pacific Ocean 163°W and 22°N, 500 km west of Hawaii. This was the last ocean landing planned for U.S. manned space flights; future flights on the Space Shuttle would be wheeled touchdowns at land bases. The CM landed in \u201cstable 2\u201d position (upside down) 7.4 km from the prime recovery ship, U.S.S. New Orleans. After swimmers from the rescue helicopter righted the spacecraft and attached a flotation collar, the Apollo was lifted by crane on to the deck of the recovery ship and Stafford, Brand, and Slayton stepped out to the cheers of the ship\u2019s crew. President Ford telephoned congratulations. During the welcome, the crew was evidently experiencing eye and lung discomfort; subsequent conversations and spacecraft data revealed that, during reentry, the earth landing system had failed to jettison the apex cover and drogues as scheduled and had had to be fired manually, without first disabling the reaction-control system thrusters. With the CM oscillating, the thrusters began firing rapidly to compensate, and combustion products \u2014 including a small amount of nitrogen tetroxide\u2014 entered through the cabin-pressure relief valves. As soon as the RCS system had been disabled, fresh air was once again drawn into the cabin. The crew members told flight officials that they had put on oxygen masks once the spacecraft had landed, and then activated the postlanding vent system. Because of the crew\u2019s discomfort, further shipboard ceremonies had been canceled and the crew had been sent to sick bay and then to Tripler Hospital in Hawaii for observation until 8 Aug. Primary ASTP mission objectives were to evaluate the docking and undocking of an Apollo spacecraft with a Soyuz, and determine the adequacy of the onboard orientation lights and docking target; evaluate the ability of astronauts and cosmonauts to make intervehicular crew transfers and the ability of spacecraft systems to support the transfers; evaluate the Apollo\u2019s capability of maintaining attitude-hold control of the docked vehicles and performing attitude maneuvers; measure quantitatively the effect of weightlessness on the crews\u2019 height and lower limb volume, according to length of exposure to zero-g; and obtain relay and direct synchronous-satellite navigation tracking data to determine their accuracy for application to Space Shuttle navigation-system design.

Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, Soviet art glorified man\u2019s role in space, whereas U.S. art emphasized technology, the Baltimore Sun reported. U.S. artists, commissioned by NASA and the National Gallery of Art to record the space program, showed basically factual treatments of blastoffs, launch towers, and mazes of steel gridwork. Artist Alden Wicks depicted Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Vehicle Assembly Building as \u201cThe New Olympus.\u2019\u2019 Men played subordinate roles in U.S. art; they swarmed through control centers or, as in Jamie Wyeth\u2019s \u201cFiring Room,\u201d sat by the dozens in front of individual TV monitors. Engineers ministered to launch vehicles like priests before an idol. Even in the pen-and-ink drawings of individual astronauts, faces were diminished by the detailed minutiae of spacesuit and life-support paraphernalia. By contrast, man dominated the Soviet art. Artist Anatoly Yakushin depicted pioneer rocket theoretician Konstantin Tsiolkovsky against a geometric maze, but man controlled the idea. A painting by Boris Okorokov showed a young flight controller commanding abstract equipment, in contrast to Wyeth\u2019s passive TV-monitor watchers. The irony of the two artistic visions was that they \u201creverse the technological visions of the nations\u2019 manned space programs,\u201d the Sun said. In reality, U.S. flights left much of the flying up to the astronauts, while the Soviets had kept their cosmonauts as passive as possible. Also included in the exhibition were paintings by Apollo-Soyuz Test Project cosmonaut Aleksey A. Leonov, the only one of the artists who had seen outer space. He painted cosmic scenes in brilliant colors: His deep space was not a flat black, but a composite of black and indigo, streaked with magenta and stars with violet coronas.

The Star said the Navy had chosen the F\u201418 under pressure from DOD and Congress, after the Air Force selected the F\u201416 for its low-cost fighter instead of the fighter version of the F\u201418. At the time the Navy estimated the cost of each F\u201418 as $7.8 million, or $2.6 billion to develop and produce the first 128 F\u201418s; however, the Star reported, a DOD analysis found the 5-yr costs would be closer to $4.3 billion. The future of the program was under discussion. One alternative would be to raise projected Navy budget to accommodate the increased costs of the F\u201418. Another would be for the Navy to drop F\u201418 and go back to industry to design and develop a lower cost fighter that would fit into the original budget and, in the interim, to let the Navy buy fighter-bombers from McDonnell Douglas to meet its fleet-modernization needs in the early 1980s.

Pioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972 and traveling out of the solar system at 43 200 km per hr, was operating normally despite a report that the spacecraft was making unexplained orientation changes [see 11 June]. The apparent changes were caused when, during a routine change in spacecraft orientation on 6 May, the spacecraft\u2019s star sensor made an undetected shift in its lock from the star Betelgeuse to the star Sirius. This shift twisted the frame of reference for measuring direction, and for changing the direction of spin-axis pointing. As a result, onboard and ground computers had recorded a gradual northward shift of the spin axis relative to the earth\u2019s motion around the sun. Also, when the thrusters were fired to move the spin axis with the earth\u2019s east-west course, \u201csouthward\u201d impulses were necessary.

Program goals were to meet telecommunications requirements of Arabic-speaking states in North Africa and the Middle East for police work, weather broadcasting, civil aviation communications, and shipping, and to expand Arab technology into space. The Arab States Broadcasting Union estimated immediate need of 15 radio channels for direct broadcast of educational and cultural programs to remote areas, and 2 TV channels each for general and educational broadcasting. Estimated need of the Arab countries by 1976 would be as many as 1060 telephone, teletypewriter, and telegraph channels, and up to 6200 channels for this traffic by mid-1984. Av Wk reported that, although the first satellites and initial ground stations would be bought from Western countries, the long-term goal was to shift operation and control to Arab nationals after 6 mo. The system, which would provide communications and broadcast coverage for 95% of the Arab world, would include a main orbiting satellite, a standby orbiting satellite to replace the prime satellite in case of failure, and a reserve satellite kept on the ground ready for quick launch in case of satellite failure.

      "story": " Cosmic rays\u2014the most energetic particles in the universe\u2014probably originated in supernovas within our own galaxy, Dr. Floyd W. Stecker, Goddard Space Flight Center scientist, wrote in an article in Physical Review Letters. Dr. Stecker had based his conclusions on data from NASA\u2019s Explorer 48 (Small Astronomy Satellite\u2014B, launched 16 Nov. 1972). Scientists had been speculating on the source of cosmic radiation since its discovery at the turn of the century, when it was thought to be identical with gamma rays. With the advent of radio astronomy and the rapid development of new experimental techniques and instrumentation, supernovas had been considered a possible source of cosmic rays; however, other scientists believed cosmic radiation had extragalactic origins, such as quasars. Explorer 48, measuring cosmic-ray intensity without interference from earth\u2019s atmosphere, had been able to obtain the gamma-ray information needed to complement ground-based radio-astronomy data. The SAS-B scientific team at GSFC had measured a large amount of gamma radiation coming from the Milky Way galaxy, the most intense coming from the center of the galaxy. As gamma rays resulted primarily from collisions of cosmic rays with interstellar gas, and the detailed Explorer 48 data had identified the direction from which most of the gamma rays came, Dr. Stecker could pinpoint an area of intense activity midway between the galactic center and the earth. The active area was a region containing numerous interstellar gas clouds\u2014but not enough to account for all the gamma-ray production\u2014as well as a large number of supernova remnants. Dr. Stecker deduced that cosmic rays were to be found in the same regions as supernova remnants and in proportion to their number.

The report stated that present institutional arrangements were \u201cnot adequate\u201d to encourage future applications of space technology to promising areas such as natural resource exploration and management, telecommunications for education and health care, and long-range weather and climate forecasting. The report added: \u201cThere exists at present no institutional mechanism that permits the large body of potential users. . .to express their needs and to have a voice in matters leading to the definition of new systems.\u201d Recommendations by the board included establishment of a national space applications council to direct policies affecting nonmilitary space applications; to set priorities for meeting user needs; to provide for exchanges between users and providers of space technology; and to encourage non-Federal investment in the application of space systems. The council could operate as an interagency group, with representation from state and local governments. To meet the launch needs of future applications satellites, the board recommended that plans for the Space Shuttle provide an early opportunity to orbit payloads in either polar or geosynchronous orbits. The Shuttle-launched payloads would have applications in hazardous weather warnings and long-range weather and climate predictions; land-use planning; agriculture, forest, and range management; exploration for food, water, energy, and mineral resources; and environmental monitoring. Other specific recommendations included lower cost, more accessible ground data-collection and readout stations; long-term observations of climatic factors\u2014such as albedo, heat control of mixed layer in ocean, cloud distribution, and climatically significant changes in vegetation, land use, and snow and ice cover\u2014to help provide a sound basis for long-range weather prediction; a resolution of 3 to 10 m for land-use applications; greater emphasis on Federal research and development programs for spaceborne sensors of water resources; continued development of earth physics techniques, including a system to measure relative displacement of tectonic plates within 3 cm; and vigorous continuation of the SEASAT-Aand Nimbus\u2014 C programs. The board had based its findings on the deliberations of 110 potential users of space-derived information and services who had attended a July 1974 study group in Colorado.

The committee supported manned NASA activities such as an international cooperative space-docking mission built on the successes of Apollo and Skylab programs, and the development of the Space Shuttle as an economical, versatile transportation system to give a wide variety of users access to space. The committee also endorsed a space science flight program furthering knowledge of the earth, atmosphere, moon, sun, planets, interplanetary space, and stars; a research and development program to identify and demonstrate useful applications of space techniques in areas such as weather and climate, pollution monitoring, earth-resources survey, earth and ocean physics, communications, and space processing; U.S. leadership in aeronautics and space programs; worldwide tracking and data acquisition support for NASA\u2019s manned and unmanned programs; a program to assist in the development of national energy self-sufficiency; and a technology utilization program to speed dissemination of technological and engineering information gained during NASA programs to government, industry, and other users. The committee restored $48.4 million for the two-spacecraft Pioneer\u2014Venus mission scheduled for launch in 1978; the House had cut the funds requested by NASA in the original budget. The Senate agreed with NASA that the project had high scientific priority, and that delaying it to a less opportune launch window when Venus was further from the earth would require redesign of the spacecraft and would cost $50 million more than originally planned. The committee also restored $1 million cut by the House from the $5 million requested for definition studies and advanced technological development of the Large Space Telescope. The study was necessary for NASA to define an optimum design at minimum cost. The committee added $7 million to the $7 million NASA request for research and development to help understand and monitor physical and chemical processes in the upper atmosphere, emphasizing the need for studies of the depletion of stratospheric ozone. Because some committee members had had reservations about the high cost and safety hazards of the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the committee said it would like to be notified well in advance of any future joint space mission to permit an accurate assessment of potential benefits and costs. The committee\u2019s recommendation of $82.1 million for construction of facilities, $25 million less than the request, would allow continuation of previous work including Space Shuttle facilities, facility rehabilitation and modification and minor construction, and facility planning and design. Not only did the committee, agreeing with the House action, cut the $2.5 million requested for an addition to the Lunar-Sample Curatorial Facility at Johnson Space Center, it also agreed with the House in denying funds to modify the 40- by 80-ft wind tunnel at Ames Research Center\u2014not included in the original request but authorized by Congress\u2014until the committee had had an opportunity to review the necessary funding in a formal budget request. The recommendation of $775.5 million for research and program management, the same amount approved by the House, was $0.5 million less than NASA\u2019s request. The reduction reflected a 10% cut in General Services Administration rental charges.

      "story": " Soviet engineers had been working on a \u201cspaceplane\u201d to carry cosmonauts to and from orbit as part of a long-term project to establish a major space platform in the 1980s, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Western observers had expected the reusable spacecraft to be launched by an expendable booster, but CSM reported that the rumored aim was to fly it from the back of a ramjet-powered boost vehicle that would return to base. The project was thought to be linked with development of a large multiman modular space station that the Soviets expected to assemble in orbit before 1980. CSM reported that U.S. Air Force reconnaissance satellites had noted preparations at the Baykonur Cosmodrome to retest the huge SLX\u201414 booster, scheduled to launch the station. The SLX\u201414 had been delayed for 5 yr by a series of mishaps: Two launch complexes had been built for the SLX\u201414, one of which burned during a 1969 fueling test. Intelligence reports indicated it had been rebuilt. In an August 1975 issue of Sputnik magazine, reprinted from the Soviet Naukal Zhin, U.S.S.R. Chief of Cosmonaut Training Vladimir A. Shatalov confirmed Soviet interest in a reusable space vehicle. Although \u201cthe future of cosmonautics is largely connected with longterm orbital stations,\u201d he said, the fact that carrier rockets were extremely expensive and could be used only once was \u201cbecoming a serious brake on the development of cosmonautics and relevant research.\u201d Neither the airplane nor the spaceship had proven capable of flying into orbit and then reentering. But there is every reason to believe that in the not-so-distant future aviation and cosmonautics would \u201cdraw appreciably closer together.\u201d Shatalov said Soviet and U.S. scientists had already made important high-altitude and highspeed experiments. Shatalov visualized \u201ca new-type spaceship\u201d consisting of a smaller one launched from a larger one after reaching required speed. The carrier craft would return to a landing field, and the smaller craft would orbit, accomplish its mission, and then land. \u201cCreation of an apparatus with greater orbital maneuverability would . . . make it possible ... to deliver satellites on orbits in the spacecraft\u2019s freight compartment, serve and repair them in space and bring back to earth samples of explorations and observations and even the satellites themselves if they go out of order.\u201d Although \u201ccreation of this new type of space apparatus\u201d posed a host of technical problems, \u201cmodern science and technology can solve them\u201d and \u201cthe time was not far off when such a plane would make its maiden flight.\u201d (Gatland, CSM, 28 July 75, 11; Sputnik, \u201cPlane for Outer Space,\u201d Aug 75, 68-71)",

Hearth, Deputy Director of Goddard Space Flight Center, gave in their testimony before the Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications of the House Committee on Science and Technology a preview of the new NASA report \u201cOutlook for Space.\u201d The report had been submitted to NASA by a 21-member study group established by Dr. Fletcher in June 1974 to develop an unconstrained listing of desirable and practical civilian space activities; to group these around goals, objectives, and themes; to define R&D tasks required by potential commercial and operational uses of space; to identify social and economic challenges that could benefit from space-reported data; and to relate space goals and objectives to national ones. All space objectives defined by the study group were evaluated in terms of their contribution to national interests, which included expansion of human knowledge, physical benefits to the U.S. and humanity, contribution to the vitality of the nation, exploration of the unknown, national prestige and self-esteem, and international cooperation. The report suggested categorizing space missions as either earth-oriented or extraterrestrial. Earth-oriented programs for the rest of the century should help increase food production by improved weather and water-availability forecasting, improved crop forecasting, improved detection and monitoring of diseases and infestations in vegetation. The consequent economic benefits and stabilization of the commodity market could gain hundreds of millions of dollars per year. Other earth-oriented space programs should emphasize improved forecasting of seasonal and climatic trends, to aid in the managing of food and energy resources and associated transportation requirements. Benefits from improved climate forecasting could reach hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The space program should also address itself to the challenge of the unknown by adding to man\u2019s knowledge of cosmic and human evolution and destiny. Spacecraft could take instruments above the \u201cdark and dirty glass\u201d of earth\u2019s opaque atmosphere, and should continue to carry instruments to other planets, setting up laboratories there as well as bringing samples back to earth for analysis. Extraterrestrial missions should include textural, chemical, and isotopic planetary studies and comparisons of atmospheric trends for all planets and their satellites. Plans should also continue for human activities in space, using both the space shuttle and free-flying laboratories to repair and maintain orbiting spacecraft systems and perform research in space. Although the study panel had found it difficult to assert that manned orbiting or planetary bases should be undertaken in the next 25 yrs, it found that man was an integral and necessary part of the more creative space-exploration programs. If the U.S. was to avail itself of the potential benefits of space, the next logical step for NASA\u2019s manned program could be development of a permanent space facility in which crews could work for extended periods.

Second, the President-appointed Director and assistants would be subject to confirmation by the Senate. Third, H.R. 9058 described the duties and functions of the new office more precisely than had the Administration biU.

A 15 July article in West Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine said that \u201ctechnically the Apollo-Soyuz enterprise will show nothing much.\u201d The reason for the mission had been political since it was agreed upon in 1972. It was \u201cfully in line with the detente and rapprochement policy of the two superpowers.\u201d The astronautic field was particularly useful for propaganda because it could mark the \u201cbeginning of an intellectual and scientific exchange of opinion of advantage to both sides.\u201d However, \u201cif one looks. . .at rapprochement in other fields, such as SALT. . . , one must remain skeptical regarding \u2018atmospheric\u2019 improvements to be achieved outside the atmosphere of the world.\u201d Milika Sundic, a Yugoslavian commentator, said concerning ASTP, \u201cNobody doubts its success, or. . .the good intentions and will of the two superpowers.\u201d The technical aspect of the mission was least important, and the political side \u201cconstitutes its essence.\u201d The joint undertakings both on earth and in space reflected the superpowers\u2019 belief in a \u201cfull equilibrium of forces rather than trust in one another.\u201d This lack of trust was the consequence not only of different systems but different interests which went beyond national borders. The fact that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. were leaders of two military alliances could not lead to greater trust between them. But, \u201cwithout blocs and without ambitions going beyond national borders, the situation would be. . .more favorable both for the superpowers and for the rest of the world.\u201d One hoped that nobody intended to divide up space along bloc lines and that nobody would misuse it for solving this world\u2019s problems. \u201cThird World countries may not be present at today\u2019s rendezvous in space, but they have a claim on the part played by science in the Soviet-American undertaking.\u201d Regarding their rights on the earth, \u201cthe Third World has no intention of renouncing them, and even less of abandoning the fate of peace to the big powers, for peace is indivisible both on earth and in space.\u201d Hungary\u2019s 15 July issue of Nepszabadsag said the joint space flight was a scientific undertaking inseparable from \u201cnormalization\u201d between the two states and reflecting the advance of peaceful coexistence. The joint cosmic attempt called attention to the vast possibilities inherent in dynamic scientific cooperation between the two countries in other, no less important, areas. Bulgaria\u2019s 15 July Rabotnichesko said in an editorial that ASTP not only would mark \u201ca new stage in the development of space research and will open up new prospects for cooperation between the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A. but will also be a telling example to be followed by all other states and peoples on the earth. . . .\u201d A 26 July commentary by a Peking correspondent in the People\u2019s Republic of China said that the U.S.-U.S.S.R. handshake in space\u2014despite the show and till the money spent to advertise it\u2014 could not \u201ccover up their fierce struggle on earth.\u201d In fact, the two superpowers \u201cregard each other as the enemy in space. They have been contending for military superiority in space ever since the first satellite was launched.\u201d The handshake was but a contention with \u201ceach trying to cheat and outwit the other.\u201d Finland\u2019s Karjalaimen called the joint mission \u201chistoric\u201d from the point of view of both space technology and world politics.

The emissions, subsequently confirmed by NASA\u2019s Explorer 53 (SAS 3 Small Astronomy Satellite launched 7 May 1975), steadily increased in intensity until they were five times greater than any observed to date. New York Times reporter Walter Sullivan quoted Dr. Terry Matilsky, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, as saying that when the emissions were first observed \u201cwe couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Sas 3\u2014operated by Goddard Space Flight Center\u2014was able to pinpoint the location of the emissions to within 1 or 2 arc-min. With this clue scientists hoped to explain the phenomenon using ground-based optical and radio telescopes. Observatories around the world had been alerted and were trying to pinpoint the source. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported MIT\u2019s Dr. Saul A. Rappaport as speculating that the emissions probably had been caused by masses of material falling from a large star into an extremely dense neutron star or black hole.

Using a Fourier interferometer onboard a U\u20142 aircraft, JPL scientists had measured the distribution of hydrogen chloride molecules at altitudes between 10 and 21 km during 6 separate flights in May. Hydrogen chloride\u2014produced by the breakdown of aerosol gas molecules in the upper atmosphere and released naturally, in small amounts, from the ocean surface and volcanic eruptions\u2014was one of several trace gases thought to play a major role in controlling the equilibrium of the protective ozone layer. JPL had found traces of the chloride beginning at 15 km, and reaching a maximum of almost 1 part per billion at 20 km. Although the results did not represent a direct effect of aerosol gas, or Freons, on stratospheric ozone, JPL scientists recommended continuing measurements to detect any future buildup. The ozone measurements, part of NASA\u2019s Stratospheric Research Program, had begun when a JPL-designed instrument was flown on the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic transport in 1973. Data collected on these flights included the first detection of nitric oxide, along with new information on the geographic and vertical distribution of water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane, and furnished a base for the 1975 study.

Pinsky of the Univ. of Houston\u2014reported finding evidence of a particle with only one magnetic pole. The discovery of the monopole, if confirmed, could have a major impact on physics, with practical applications such as new medical therapies, new sources of energy, extremely small and efficient motors and generators, and new particle accelerators of much higher energy than any yet built. The monopole, representing the basic indivisible unit of magnetism, would exist in two forms of opposite polarity, the north pole and the south pole. This would be analogous to the basic electric charge, the electron, which existed in the positive and negative charges, the proton and electron. Existence of the monopole had been predicted in 1931 by Paul Dirac, Fla. State Univ. professor. The four physicists detected tracks of the particle that had apparently penetrated a sandwich of more than 33 layers of plastic and emulsion photographic film suspended from a balloon floating at 39 600 m.

Predictions based on satellite data of the April through June 1972 streamflow were within 3% of the actual total. Also, composite results from 2 yr of data over the mountains indicated that Landsat snowcover observations could be useful in predicting runoff and seasonal streamflow. James C. Barnes of Environmental Research and Technology, Inc., reported that the earth resources experiment package (EREP) flown aboard the 1973\u201474 Skylab Orbital Workshop missions had provided the first opportunity to examine reflectance characteristics of snowcover in several spectral bands from the visible to the near infrared. Results indicated that near-infrared methods could distinguish between snow and water droplet clouds and could detect areas of melting snow. (NASA Hq WB, 28 Feb 76, 2; NASA SP\u2014391, text) The evidence was consistent with calculations made in 1971 by Canadian astronomer Dr. Michael W. Ovenden. Dr. Ovenden\u2019s studies of irregularities in the orbits of planets, especially Uranus and Neptune, suggested that a major disruptive event had occurred in the solar system approximately 16 million yrs ago. He had arrived at this time by age-dating carbon-bearing meteorites that had fallen to earth, and theorized that the event could be explained by the explosion of a huge planet 90 times the size of earth. During the meeting Dr. Stuart Bowyer, Univ. of Calif, astronomer, surprised the 740 astronomers attending the meeting by reporting that a Univ. of Calif, telescope flown aboard the Apollo spacecraft during the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project [see 15\u201426 July] had picked up the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation of a star. EUV, a small segment of the spectrum between normal ultraviolet and x-rays, had been considered by astronomers as practically invisible because of probable absorption by interstellar dust and gas.

      "story": " Viking 1 was successfully launched at 5:22 pm EDT from Eastern Test Range\u2019s Launch Pad 41 on a Titan Ill-Centaur launch vehicle. The launch, first scheduled for 11 Aug., had been postponed until 14 Aug. to replace a faulty thrust-vector control valve on the launch vehicle [see 11 Aug.]. A second delay had occurred when the spacecraft\u2019s internal batteries had discharged to 9 volts, well below safe limits [see 13 Aug.]. The spacecraft, Viking A, had been removed from the launch vehicle and replaced by Viking B. The range safety officer had issued a waiver of standard procedures and permitted removal and installation of the spacecraft without detanking and depressurizing the launch vehicle, thus allowing the launch to be rescheduled for 20 Aug. Viking 1, consisting of a 2360-kg orbiter attached to an 1180-kg lander, was placed in a trajectory to Mars within the designed 3-sigma limits. Nearly 35 min after trajectory insertion, the Centaur stage separated from the spacecraft. The solar panels were deployed and oriented toward the sun, and the biocap\u2014a container used to hermetically seal the lander while in earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014was jettisoned. On 27 Aug. at 2:30 pm EDT a trajectory-correction maneuver targeted the spacecraft to its Mars orbital insertion point. By 28 Aug. all systems aboard the spacecraft were operating normally and in a cruise mode. Travel time to Mars was estimated at 10 mo, with a possible Mars landing on 4 July 1976, the height of the U.S. Bicentennial. A second spacecraft, Viking B, had been scheduled for a 1 Sept, launch to arrive at Mars in 12 mos. The Viking missions supported NASA\u2019s planetary program goals of exploring the solar system and gaining knowledge of its origin and evolution, and of the origin and evolution of life and of the dynamic processes that shaped man\u2019s terrestrial environment. Specific purpose of the two Viking missions was to increase knowledge of Mars by making observations from Mars orbit and by direct measurements in the atmosphere and on the surface, with particular emphasis on biological, chemical, and environmental data on past or present existence of life on the planet. Viking 1 was targeted to land in the Martian equatorial region, in a very low area resembling the fluvial plain of a dry river bed\u2014an ideal site to search for organic material. Alternate sites for both Viking landers had been selected and there would be some flexibility until insertion into Mars orbit, after which the available band of landing sites would be narrowed by orbital geometry. Once in orbit, the orbiter would survey prospective landing sites; when the decision on where to land had been made, retrorockets would separate the lander from the orbiter and the lander would descend to the surface, sequentially braked by its aeroshell\u2019s drag, by a parachute, and finally by its retrorockets. After landing, the science instrumentation would be activated and exploration would begin; data would be transmitted back to earth by the lander radio or through a radio-relay link with the orbiter. The orbiter\u2019s main body, an octagonal ring 46 cm high with alternating 140- and 51-cm sides, consisted of 16 modular compartments. The entire structure was 10 m across the tips of the extended solar panels and 3.3 m high from the lander attachment points to the launch vehicle. Besides propulsion, navigation and control, communications, power, computer, and data-storage subsystems, the orbiter carried its science instrumentation mounted on a scan platform that could move with 2 degrees of freedom. The three science instruments were twin high-resolution, slow-scan TV cameras; an infrared atmospheric water detector; and a high-resolution infrared thermal mapper for detecting surface-temperature variations. The lander was a six-sided aluminum and titanium box 46.2 cm deep and enclosed top and bottom by cover plates; it measured 3 m wide and 2 m high from the footpads to the top of the S-band antenna. The six sides measured 109 cm and 56 cm alternately, with the three landing legs attached to the three narrower sides. The three retrorockets were mounted at 120° intervals on the lander; generating up to 2838 newtons (638 lbs) thrust, they would be ignited at an altitude of 1220 m to slow the lander\u2019s descent from 222 kph to 9 kph at landing. Four small engines provided attitude control. In addition to subsystems for thermal control, power, and communications, the lander carried six instruments: twin scanning TV cameras, a sophisticated biology laboratory, a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer, a meteorology instrument, and a seismometer. Used with numerous temperature, pressure, and magnetic sensors, the instruments would perform entry, landed, and radio experiments. NASA\u2019s investigation of Mars had begun in 1964 with the launch of Mariner 4. That spacecraft\u2019s flyby on 15 July 1965 had revealed the planet to be moonlike with a dry, barren, cratered surface showing little evidence of wind or water erosion and no magnetic field. The better instrumented Mariners 6 and 7 that flew by the planet during the summer of 1969 reported a chaotic view of jumbled ridges and valleys unlike anything found on the earth or moon. The spacecraft also showed wide featureless expanses where craters had been somehow eroded, suggesting that Mars had been geologically active. Mariner 6 and 7 photographs showed a thin layer of snow\u2014probably carbon dioxide\u2014and instruments measured a thin atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide. High-quality photographs from Mariner 9, placed in Martian orbit on 13 Nov. 1971, provided evidence of fluid erosion, glacial action, and volcanoes. The Viking missions had continued the Mariner explorations of Mars. Viking was managed by Langley Research Center under overall direction of NASA\u2019s Office of Space Science; LaRC also had management responsibility for the lander system designed and built by Martin Marietta Corp. Jet Propulsion Laboratory designed and built the orbiter system. The Titan-Centaur launch vehicle was the responsibility of Lewis Research Center; LaRC managed launch and flight operations executed by Martin Marietta, Kennedy Space Center, and JPL. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for tracking and data systems, and JPL managed the mission control and computing-center system.

Dr. Nicogossian said that the spot had not been noticed before because the x-rays were difficult to read and the spot had been covered by normal vasculature and bony structure.

Placed in geosynchronous orbit above the earth, the satellites would collect and convert sunlight into energy and beam it to earth as low-density microwaves. The space colony would have several advantages that might make it self-supporting: weightlessness for manufacturing and transportation, massive use of lunar minerals, and continuous natural sunlight for increased agricultural productivity.

      "story": " A planet\u2019s size and bulk might be more important than its location in the solar system in determining whether it can support life, Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in a New York Times article. Conventional scientific thought had always been that the chance of life\u2019s evolving on a planet was narrowly restricted by the planet\u2019s distance from its parent star. However, planetology\u2014the study of comparative geology of the planets, made possible by space probes such as Pioneer, Mariner, and Viking\u2014provided evidence for the newer theory. The most important single factor in the geology of earth-like planets was the amount of internal heat left over from their birth. Planets as large as earth conserved heat, losing it very slowly through volcanic action over long periods of time. Molten volcanic material carried gases, including water vapor, that had been trapped below the planet\u2019s surface; the vapors condensed into oceans, other gases formed an atmosphere, and life began. Mariner\u2019s photos of Mars had confirmed the existence of volcanoes; but, because of the planet\u2019s relatively small size, these exhausted their internal heat supply and died out rapidly about 100 million yr ago. During its active period, Mars must have had in its atmosphere large volumes of volcanic gases, including water vapor; Mariner photos had shown what were apparently dry river beds. When the volcanoes became extinct, the water and atmosphere leaked away into space and the small planet was left dry and nearly airless. Any life forms found on Mars by Viking or future space probes would probably be fossils. The study of lunar material added another example to the comparative geology of earth-like planets: The moon rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts had revealed volcanic activity on the moon; because the moon was smaller than Mars, this activity had stopped even earlier and the gases and moisture escaped even more quickly, leaving another dry, airless, and lifeless body. Scientists concluded that Mars was cold and lifeless not because it was farther from the sun than earth but because it was smaller and geologically inert. If the earth were moved out to the orbit of Mars, the average temperature of the earth would drop somewhat but its insulating atmosphere, continually replenished by volcanic gases for some billions of years longer, would maintain a livable temperature over large areas of the surface.

Research done in 1948 by Johns Hopkins Univ. scientists had demonstrated that ATP was the third essential ingredient\u2014along with luciferin and luciferase\u2014necessary for the firefly\u2019s glow, and that the amount of light generated was directly proportionate to the level of ATP present.

(KSC Release 181\u201475) 8, 9, and 17 September: Data collected by sounding rockets, satellites, instrumented balloons, and high-flying aircraft had supported the hypothesis that fluorocarbons such as those found in aerosol spray cans might be breaking down the earth\u2019s ozone shield, scientists told hearings of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences\u2019 Subcommittee on the Upper Atmosphere. Ozone in the stratosphere screened the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation that might increase incidence of cancer and other skin diseases and prove lethal to many life forms as well as damage eyes, crops, and livestock. An increase in atmospheric fluorocarbons could also have a greenhouse effect, permitting sunlight to pass freely but inhibiting the escape of heat in the form of infrared radiation. This would warm the lower atmosphere and the earth, altering aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and environmental chemicals, and creating climate changes. An extreme greenhouse effect had been blamed for Venus\u2019 oven-hot temperatures. Dr. Warren R. Muir, cochairman of the Interagency Task Force on Inadvertent Modification of the Stratosphere, told the subcommittee, \u201cBased on our preliminary assessment there seems to be a legitimate cause for concern.\u201d If additional government research\u2014with NASA coordinating\u2014had proved more conclusively the danger to the environment, the government should take action for \u201cprompt enactment of toxic substances legislation.\u201d Dr. Wilson K. Talley of the Environmental Protection Agency agreed that fluorocarbons might pose a problem to the stratosphere, and that the total effect of releasing fluorocarbons and other halo carbon compounds into the atmosphere might not become apparent for 10 yrs. But, with evidence of public danger not strong enough to stand up to a court challenge by manufacturers, government regulation of the offending substances would be unenforceable.

The spacecraft entered on a trajectory toward Mars accurate to within the 3-sigma tolerance. If flown without midcourse correction, Viking 2 would reach Martian orbit 279 259 km from the target. The launch had been rescheduled from 1 Sept., after the launch crew during a 28 Aug. precountdown test discovered a degradation in the detection threshold of the orbiter\u2019s S-band radio receiver. On 1 Sept., project officials decided to remove the spacecraft from the launch vehicle for additional evaluation. The launch was rescheduled for 9 Sept, after evaluation concluded that the anomaly had been caused by a faulty connector or conductor between the diplexer module and the high-gain antenna. Since the faulty part could not be isolated, the antenna and cabling were replaced, the orbiter and lander retested, encapsulated, and mated to the launch vehicle. After launch, all onboard systems and experiments were checked out. A trajectory correction maneuver on 19 Aug. targeted Viking 2 for a rendezvous with Mars on 7 Aug. 1976.

STELLAR used a solid-state silicon detector, called a charge-coupled device (CCD), for image sensing and a microcomputer to process and format the data. Previous star trackers had used high-voltage vacuum-tube image dissectors for image sensing; the tubes were difficult to produce, had a limited lifetime, developed errors, and could provide attitude-reference data from only a single star in any given observation frame. STELLAR, which substituted a single low-voltage 6-mm-sq CCD chip for the complex and expensive tube, offered the advantages of solid-state reliability and of simple programming to adapt to varying mission requirements. In addition to substantial savings in cost of flight hardware, the CCD imaging devices were expected to revolutionize TV camera design, permitting miniature low-cost home monitors within the next several years. STELLAR, which had been developed under the management of NASA\u2019s Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology, would provide trackers for planetary Mariner spacecraft after the Mariner\u2014Jupiter\u2014Saturn mission in 1977 and for such Space Shuttle payloads as the proposed Shuttle infrared telescope facility.

Need for a vigorous fuel-conservation program had been underscored by estimates from the Federal Energy Administration and Air Transport Association of America that U.S. outlays for imported oil had increased from $3 billion in 1970 to $24 billion in 1974, and could reach $32 billion by 1977.

These tests explored the question of whether the parachute recovery lines and riser lines on the three recovery parachutes to be attached to each booster would, when under tension during descent, stretch enough to develop sufficient latent energy to deploy the 52-mm-dia by 15-m long tow rope from a tray located in the booster\u2019s forward skirt. The tests employed a 10-m Saturn S\u2014II-stage adapter ring, to which the parachute lines were attached. A crane hoisted the adapter ring until the stress on the rings was 12 000 kg, about one-half the stress expected on the parachutes lowering the booster. An explosive bolt was detonated, abruptly freeing the parachute lines; they contracted and the lines and fitting to which they were attached were yanked upward more than 60 m, quite enough energy to deploy the tow line. The recovery system parachutes would be fitted with flotation devices so they could be recovered. On the first six Shuttle developmental flights, the set of parachutes would be cut free from one booster in each set of two and both would be tested to determine which configuration made it easier to retrieve and tow the booster.

The communications satellite had been launched for the Communications Satellite Corp. under a cost-reimbursable contract. At 11:18 pm EDT 26 Sept., ComSatCorp fired the apogee kick motor to put the satellite in a geosynchronous orbit with a 35 821km apogee, 35 294-km perigee, 23-hr 44-min period, and 0.1° inclination. NASA objectives for the mission were to review design, performance, and flight readiness for the Federal Communications Commission and to assure compatibility of the Intelsat spacecraft with NASA launch vehicles and launch environmental conditions, and to launch Intelsat-IVA F\u2014l into a transfer orbit that would enable the spacecraft apogee boost motor to inject the spacecraft into a synchronous orbit. Objectives were completed and the mission adjudged successful 29 Jan. 1976. ComSatCorp objectives were to fire the apogee boost motor, position the satellite into the planned geostationary orbit, and operate and manage the system for the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT). Intelsat-IVA F\u2014l, built by Hughes Aircraft Co., was 698.5 cm high and 238.2 cm in diameter, with a liftoff weight of 1515 kg and orbital weight of 825.5 kg. The spin-stabilized satellite consisted of two main elements: A rotating section contained the power subsystem, a cylindrical solar array and two nickel-cadmium batteries; the anhydrous hydrazine-powered positioning and orientation system; the solid-fueled apogee motor; and the despin-control system. The despun earth-oriented platform section contained the communications repeater, antennas, and associated elements of the telemetry and command subsystems. All spacecraft antennas were supported by a single tubular mast. For 24 hr after apogee-motor firing, Intelsat-IVA F\u2014l drifted eastward at a rate of Iff per day; then a velocity-correction maneuver slowed the spacecraft drift to 2.9P east per day. While the spacecraft was drifting, the Hawaii earth station checked out the spacecraft systems. Its final operating location, over the Atlantic Ocean at 335° east longitude, would be reached by mid-December. As primary Atlantic satellite in INTELSAT\u2019s global commercial communications satellite system, it would serve more than 40 earth stations, offering users 6250 two-way voice circuits and two TV channels. Intelsat-IVA F\u2014l was the first in the Intelsat IVA series; its communications capacity was two-thirds greater than satellites in the Intelsat IV series, seven of which were still operating. The Intelsat system began with the launch of Intelsat-I F\u2014l (Early Bird, 1) on 6 April 1965; since then NASA had launched 16 successful comsats for ComSatCorp in the Intelsat II, III, and IV series. Although Intelsat IVA satellites had been designed primarily for use over the Atlantic with its heavy communications traffic, INTELSAT planned to launch as many as five additional IVAs, some to provide service for the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. Intelsat IVAs had a design lifetime of 7 yr and a capacity sufficient to meet international communications requirements through 1979, when the system would be augmented with the even larger capacity Intelsat ^ comsats INTELSAT, created in August 1964 by adoption of the Interim Agreements for the Establishment of a Global Commercial Comsat System, now comprised 91 member nations; a 24-member board of governors exercised overall responsibility for design, development, construction, establishment, operation, and maintenance of the Intelsat space segment. ComSatCorp, a privately owned carrier company operating under a U.S. congressional mandate, had provided technical and operational management services to INTELSAT and the global system under a cost-plus-fixed-fee management services contract. NASA had been responsible for procuring the Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle, conducting preflight testing, and launching the spacecraft from the Eastern Test Range into a synchronous transfer orbit. ComSatCorp engineers in the INTELSAT Spacecraft Technical Control Center in Washington, D.C., then assumed responsibility for the mission. Overall management for the NASA portion of the mission was under the direction of the Office of Applications. Lewis Research Center was responsible for Atlas-Centaur development and operation.

In at least five documented cases, satellites had detected x-rays from globular star clusters coming from above and below the pinwheel disk of the Milky Way galaxy. These clusters, left behind when the rest of the primordial galactic matter fell into the disk of the galaxy over 10 billion yrs ago, still orbited the galactic center, bound to it by gravitational forces. Scientific evidence had indicated that the birth of new stars within clusters ended soon after the formation of the clusters themselves; the clusters had not been expected to contain any young binary star systems, those believed to make up the majority of galactic x-ray sources. This fact, along with the finding that sources were much more plentiful in globular clusters than in the galactic disk, indicated that some different process of x-ray production was at work. Scientists offered three explanations for the findings: existence of very large black holes, 1000 times as massive as the sun, within the clusters; a smaller black hole steadily fed with matter from the surrounding disk; and origin of the x-ray emissions in binary stars behaving like x-ray binaries in the galactic disk but with very different origins. Scientists were hoping that two more x-ray satellites, U.K.\u2019s Ariel 5 (launched 15 Oct. 1974) and Ans 1 (Netherlands Astronomical Satellite launched 30 Aug. 1975), would contribute additional data to the study.

The mission, which could include a swing by Neptune, was being studied for inclusion in NASA\u2019s FY 1977 budget request. A mission to Uranus and Neptune would mean that every planet in the solar system except Pluto would have been probed by a U.S. spacecraft by 1988. The spacecraft itself would be adapted directly from the Mariner probe now under development at Jet Propulsion Laboratory for a planned 1977 mission to Saturn; like Mariner-Satum, the Uranus mission would use the gravity of Jupiter to hurl the spacecraft on toward the more remote planet. If the spacecraft remained healthy after it investigated Uranus, it would use the gravity of that planet to fly on to Neptune, more than 1.6 billion km deeper into space.

Twenty-two contracts, totaling approximately $12 million, would be awarded as part of the Low Cost Silicon Array Project managed by JPL for ERDA. Objective of the project was to create by 1985 an industrial capability of producing silicon solar cells or arrays at a market price of less than $500/kw. Cost to date had been $20 000/kw. The demand for solar cells was expected to increase from 100 kw annually in 1975 to 500 000 kw annually by 1985. JPL negotiations included production of low-cost solar-grade silicon, economical production of silicon in large-area sheets suitable for use in solar cells, development of economical encapsulation materials and techniques for an array lifetime of 20 yr, and development of automated processes and facilities for low-cost production of arrays. Future contracts would be negotiated to procure array modules for a series of ERDA-funded tests of photovoltaic systems, in cooperation with the Department of Defense to determine the technical feasibility of using photovoltaics for military applications, and in cooperation with Lewis Research Center for a similar civilian effort. (NASA Release 75\u2014280) The descent module of Venera 9 separated from the main spacecraft 20 Oct., 2 days before it reached the Venus atmosphere, which it entered at 11:58 pm EDT 21 Oct., landing on the surface at 1:13 am EDT Oct. 22. When the atmosphere had slowed the descent sufficiently, a parachute system had been deployed at about 50 km above the surface, and the lander studied the cloud layers and atmosphere during the rest of the descent. The lander modules had been built to withstand the hostile environment at the Venus surface, with temperatures that reach 500°C and pressures up to 100 times that of earth\u2019s atmosphere. Before landing, the modules had been cooled to \u2014 KTC to provide a reserve of cold temperature that would permit operation for about an hour before overheating. Venera 10, launched 14 June and following the same procedure, had separated from its orbiter 23 Oct. and had landed on Venus at 1:17 am EDT 25 Oct. Venera9, launched 8 June from the Baykonur cosmodrome, was the third Soviet spacecraft to make a soft landing on Venus: Venera 7 and 8, which landed on Venus in Dec. 1970 and July 1972, respectively, had transmitted technical data for 23 and 50 min, respectively, but did not carry cameras. Pictures sent by the Venera 9 lander showed a rugged surface with sharp-angled and flat-surfaced rocks 30 to 35 cm across and some boulders. Pictures sent by the Venera 10 lander, which touched down 2200 km from the site of Venera 9, showed what seemed to be an older mountain formation with smooth rounded rocks. Soviet scientists had expressed amazement that both sites were bathed in light. The dense cloudcover that hides Venus from earth had been thought to keep the planet in perpetual shade. Dr. Arnold Selivanov, one of the TV system designers, said that they had \u201cexpected poor lighting conditions and built our instruments accordingly\u201d; this is why they had received \u201cgood pictures. . .that can be used by newspapers without any preliminary processing.\u201d The horizon of Venus discernible in a comer of the Venera photos did not appear concave (ends bent upward), as had been expected as a result of the theorized distortion resulting from the planet\u2019s dense atmosphere. The apparent geological youth of the rocks on Venus \u201ctestifies to recent catastrophic processes like volcanic eruptions or earthquakes\u2014we should say Venusquakes\u2014which took place recently,\u201d said Soviet mineralogist Dr. Aleksandr Basilevsky. \u201cVenus apparently is internally active.\u201d This conclusion had affirmed American theory that Venus resembled earth in having a liquid core, a mantle, and a rocky crust. Four Soviet scientists reviewing the Venera 9 and 10 program in an article in Pravda had summarized the descent-module findings: Temperature and pressure at the landing sites, 460°C and 90 atm, respectively; surface illumination, about 10 000 lux; local wind velocity at landing site, 0.4 to 0.7 meter per sec (Venera9) and 0.8 to 1.3 meter per sec (Venera 10); natural radioactive elements in Venus rock, 0.3% potassium, 0.0002% thorium, and 0.001% uranium. Orbiting module findings were: Temperature of Venus clouds at upper boundary, about \u2014 35°C; cloud temperatures on nocturnal side, about 1(FC higher; atmospheric temperature decreased with altitude, but local temperature elevations were observable at the 66 to 55 km level; Venus ionosphere was thinner than the terrestrial and closer to the surface; and the electron concentration on the daytime side was significantly higher than on the nocturnal side but about 10 times smaller than in the terrestrial ionosphere. Much of the information relayed from Venus had still to be processed. Cameras in the orbiting spacecraft of Venera 9 and 10 had proceeded with photographing the dense cloudcover of Venus, their first pictures received 26 Oct. showing a panorama of more than 1500 km of the clouds circulating around the planet\u2019s equator. Scientists at the Deep Space Communications Center in Moscow said the pictures \u201cconfirm the presence of powerful streams of circulating flows in the planet\u2019s atmosphere, first detected on board the American probe Mariner 10 in February 1974.\u201d There was no indication, the Baltimore Sun commented, how long the two Venus mother ships would continue in orbit.

The two main functions of VIP were to help the astronomer steer the telescope, and to continuously update the automatic stabilization system that holds the telescope steady during viewing. Automatically stabilized telescopes heretofore had used gyroscopes to keep the telescope aimed at a point in space and counteract the rotation of the earth and other disturbances; gyroscopes had been found subject to drift, causing the telescope to wander off target. VIP, using a single video sensor, could generate the signals required for all three control axes\u2014roll, pitch, and yaw\u2014and could use the visual information to point at nonvisible (infrared) sources. Previous systems using star trackers had needed from two to six conventional sensors to do the same job. Development of VIP had made use of several state-of-the-art devices: the microprocessor, a complete digital computer on a single printed circuit card, was the computer inside the VIP electronics. Two types of video sensors used by VIP were the solid-state imaging device called a CCD (charge-coupled device) that incorporated a matrix of light-sensitive elements on the surface of a silicon chip measuring 0.01 mm on a side, and an advanced vidicon tube for night vision called an ISIT (intensified-silicon intensified-target) camera.

Michael B. McElroy, professor of atmospheric sciences at Harvard University, had predicted that a projected increase in the use of nitrogen fertilizers over the next 25 yr could reduce the ozone layer 20 to 25%. Theoretically, each 1% reduction in the ozone layer could lead to thousands\u2014as many as 15 000\u2014additional cases of skin cancer in the U.S. alone. All life needs nitrogen to make proteins, McElroy pointed out. The earth\u2019s atmosphere would have lost all its nitrogen long ago except for the process by which bacteria \u201cdenitrify\u201d decayed matter in the soil; most nitrogen returned to the atmosphere in the same inert pure form in which it was taken and converted to use by earth\u2019s plant life, which then formed a source of nitrogen for other plants and animals; however, some nitrogen returned in a form that acted as a catalyst to destroy ozone. Man had recently been extracting nitrogen from the air and putting it into plant life in the form of fertilizer on a scale rivaling nature; by the year 2000, said McElroy, the amount of nitrogen extracted from the air would be double that removed by natural causes. With a sharp increase in the natural denitrification process, more nitrogen catalysts destructive to ozone would be released. Serious effects should be evident within the next 40 yr, McElroy said. Although aerosol sprays could be dispensed with, nitrogen fertilizers were a necessity for increased world food production. Increased incidence of skin cancer concerned light-skinned humans, who were unlikely to get much sympathy from darker-skinned inhabitants of areas where the fertilizers\u2014and increased food production\u2014are urgently needed.

The SP had been capable of cruising faster and higher than any other commercial jetliner and had a range of 1200 km beyond that of the standard 747. (B Sun, 15 Nov 75, A9)",

Investigators at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., and at Stanford said that magnetic forces from the sun played a role in formation of pressure troughs on earth, which bring rainy weather; observations from space, corroborated from earth measurements, indicate influence on weather from solar flares, sunspots, and high velocities of the solar wind. The weather effect involved two phenomena, the sun\u2019s magnetic-sector structure and a concept called the vorticity-area index. The index is a measure of the size of low-pressure troughs in square kilometers, calculated by computer from twice-daily standard weather-service maps. As solar magnetic sectors and boundaries were measured regularly at Mt. Wilson Observatory, the Astro-physical Observatory in the Crimea, and the Stanford Solar Observatory, scientists could compare the solar magnetic structure with the vorticity-area index to see whether the sun structure affected the nature and size of low-pressure troughs that bring rain and stormy weather.

Reporter Boyce Rensberger, writing on the theory published in the Explorers Journal by amateur scholar George Michanowsky, described clues found by Michanowsky in cuneiform texts regarding a gigantic star in the constellation Vela. No particularly bright star was to be found in Vela in modem times, Michanowsky pointed out, but astronomers had agreed that a supernova of uncertain date had probably been the forerunner of the present Gum nebula, a huge glowing cloud of hot gases centered on a relatively cold pulsar. Occurrence of the supernova had been placed anywhere from 6000 to 15 000 yr ago. In the times after the starburst, the primitive peoples\u2014especially Sumerians\u2014developed astronomy, mathematics, and writing; Michanowsky had suggested that the supernova had stimulated great attention to stellar phenomena and led to a more careful study of the heavens, to formal astronomy and mathematics, and to the need to make written records.

Reuters quoted Soviet scientist Dr. Konstantin Feoktistov as saying the purpose of the flight was to develop a transport system either to supply a space station with expendables, or to serve as an emergency rescue ship. One possibility would be to automatically dock a Soyuz with the manned station after one of the cosmonauts had removed the original Soyuz, or perhaps a new Soyuz would be used as a new return vehicle: one of these procedures would be required unless the Salyut space station had been designed with two docking positions.

Salyut 4, the orbiting space station, had been visited by the crew of Soyuz 17 for almost 30 days and by the crew of Soyuz 18 for more than 60 days. The Soyuz 20 mission had been analyzed as transfer of fuel to Salyut 4; in orbit since 26 Dec. 1974, the space station was thought to be running low on maneuvering fuel. Reporters had speculated that a new two-man crew might be sent to Salyut 4 later this year for a stay of 3 mo or longer that would break the 84-day record set by U.S. astronauts in 1974. The value of the automatic docking for resupply would be the economy of not sending men with each flight, although the Soviets had never indicated the cost of their launches. Tass reported that the \u201cspace complex Salyut-4\u2014 Soyuz-20\u201d was in an orbit with apogee 367 km, perigee 343 km, 51.6° inclination, and 91.4 min period of revolution.

In orbit the satellite became Explorer 55. Major difference between the original and new generation of atmosphere explorers was the unusually large onboard propulsion system that enabled the later spacecraft to move themselves up or down in space by hundreds of km or go from highly elliptical to circular orbits. The name \u201cdeep-dippers\u201d meant that the spacecraft could drop into the atmosphere and pull out again, taking measurements only while in the upper reaches of the thermosphere. This region, important because it absorbed most ultraviolet light and heat received from the sun and because movement of that heat determined the structure of the upper atmosphere, had been difficult to study because the altitude was too high for all aircraft and most balloons and too low for other satellites. The dipping orbit prevented accumulation of excessive heat in the metal skins of the AE spacecraft. Explorer 55 would also carry a backscatter ultraviolet spectrophotometer to obtain a vertical profile and density measurements of the ozone layer between 20°N and S; the measurements would be compared with those from Nimbus 4, launched in 1970, to evaluate the long-term accuracy of the Nimbus instrumentation. A mission operations report 23 Dec. said Explorer 55 had completed more than 400 orbits and all subsystems were performing well.

The November issue of Icarus, international journal of solar-system studies, had carried a prospectus of the Soviet CETI (communication with extraterrestrial intelligence) program divided into two phases. CETI 1* scheduled from 1975 to 1985, included the whole-sky Scan by eight stations plus monitoring by two space stations and a survey of nearby galaxies like the one under way at Arecibo. Only the eight-station project had been initiated, as far as U.S. scientists knew. CETI 2, from 1980 to 1990, had been scheduled to continue satellite monitoring but would also use setnirotatable antennas such as the RAT AN\u2014600 antenna 600 m wide, known to be located high in the Caucasus; the system consisted of numerous plates that had to be aimed individually* calling for hand alignment since no computer had been designed to perform this role. The Soviets also envisioned a monitoring station at the point beyond the moon where the gravitational fields of earth and moon would balance each other; a station at that point would be protected from the earth\u2019s own radio emissions. Identical fluctuations of signal recorded simultaneously at widely separated points would be considered to have extraterrestrial origin rather than to result from a local manmade effect.

The project, called Skylark for the British sounding rocket on which the telescope would fly, was a joint British-Anierican undertaking to study a supernova remnant known as Puppis A for information on the evolution of stars and perhaps oil the formation of neutron stars.

Knowledge about the interaction between the winter sea ice and the continental shelf would be important to government and to oil companies; government would use the information in allocating drilling areas and overseeing their use by private industry. Oil companies would need to know whether to locate drilling rigs on the ice or sink them into the sea bed; whether to bury pipelines under the ocean floor, lay them along the bottom, or run them over the ice to loading areas. The exterior sphere of the platforms, built to be dropped on the ice from small aircraft, had been constructed of a tough material to foil the hunger and curiosity of polar bears, which reportedly would attempt to chew on anything appearing different from the usual surroundings.

The principle upon which flywheels performed\u2014storage of mechanical energy by a spinning wheel\u2014had been enlarged by the use of fiber composites developed for use in spacecraft nosecones that had greater strength-to-weight ratios, being 10 to 20 times stronger than steel and much lighter. As the amount of energy stored by the flywheel varied as the square of the rotation speed, the limit had been on the tensile strength of the material used; the fiber wheel could be spun faster to store more energy per kg than the conventional metal one, and would also cost less. A superflywheel might spin at 100 000 or even 200 000 rpm. Both the Soviet Union and American industry had displayed interest in developing the flywheel; use of the technology in automobiles would reduce pollution and would represent a safety improvement. The flywheels also could act in backup systems for homes using solar energy and windmills for their energy needs.

Fluorocarbon manufacturers and users had insisted that the ozone-depletion theory had not been proved, and warned of damage to an industry that had made products worth $400 million to $450 million a year, with manufacturing facilities worth $300 million. U.S. producers had accounted for about half the world\u2019s production of fluorocarbons, which was approaching about 0.9 billion kg a year. Two Univ. of Chicago chemists\u2014Mario J. Molina and F. Sherwood Roland\u2014had advanced a theory 18 mo ago that fluorocarbons used in spray containers and in refrigerators and air conditioners were getting into the upper atmosphere, encountering ultraviolet fight (more intense at high altitudes) that split the fluorocarbon molecules to release highly active chlorine. The chlorine had depleted the atmospheric ozone by converting it to ordinary oxygen. The theory had been partly confirmed in the laboratory by National Bureau of Standards chemists who showed that ultraviolet lamps would split fluorocarbons to produce either one or two chlorine atoms, depending on the ultraviolet wavelength used. However, no one had discovered a way to measure the ozone to tell whether it had been affected by chlorines from fluorocarbon dissociation. Another clue had been to search for chlorine products such as hydrochloric acid in the stratosphere; tests conducted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using U-2 flights and balloons had Confirmed the presence in the stratosphere of hydrochloric acid that had not originated from the earth. Granting the effect of aerosols, opinions had been divided upon the significance of ozone depletion: possible consequences of additional ultraviolet radiation impinging upon earth included increased incidence of skin cancer, harmful effects on animal and plant life, and alteration of temperature patterns in the stratosphere with resulting alteration of weather patterns on earth. Even without proof of damage, public apprehension of risk had increased pressure for a ban on the suspect chemicals, especially in aerosols. (Tannenbaum in WSJ, 3 Dec 75, 1)",

A satellite watching Russia from a spot in the sky over the Indian Ocean had set off false alarms of a missile attack 18 Oct. when its sensitive instruments detected heat such as might result from the firing of missiles. The heat had originated from a fire caused by breaks in a natural gas pipeline, as later satellite photographs confirmed, but between the alarm and the photographs U.S. intelligence had speculated that the Soviets had trained lasers on the satellite to prevent detection, in violation of the U.S.-Soviet agreement on arms. The gas fires had set off other warnings after 18 Oct., apparently because the ruptures and fires occurred at different times and places in Russia in both October and November. CSM quoted an article in Aviation Week magazine questioning whether lasers could be used to prevent monitoring of military activity on the ground by satellites, noting that officials at the U.S. Arms Control Agency had discounted the reported incidents.

Even before it had gone into full operational use, the C\u20145A wing had been shown in static ground tests to be too weak to carry the prescribed load and had developed fatigue cracks in the metal structure. The cracking had been attributed to high stress levels inherent in the design, ineffective fasteners on the wing panels, and difficulty in mating the stiff contours of the wing and joints during manufacture. The Air Force had paid $4.5 billion on delivery of 81 C\u20145As; it had already spent more than $198 million through June 1975 correcting deficiencies for which Lockheed was responsible under the original contract, renegotiated when Lockheed was in financial difficulty in 1971.

Although the flights had been billed as the first commercial service by a supersonic jet, and had been scheduled to get ahead of the Concorde passenger service set for January between Paris and Rio and between London and Bahrain, Tu\u2014144 would not carry passengers until the second half of 1976 at the earliest, and then on internal routes, according to Deputy Aviation Minister Nikolai Boikov.

Fred Singer\u2014who had served in 1970\u201471 as chairman of an interagency task group to evaluate environmental effects of supersonic transports\u2014pointed out that the effect of Concorde pollution would be completely swamped by other factors that had been shown to decrease atmospheric ozone\u2014nitrogen fertilizers, carbon tetrachloride, and fluorocarbons. Banning the Concorde from the U.S. would not prevent it from depositing pollutants elsewhere; in any case, military planes flying in the stratosphere and subsonic planes pushing to higher altitudes to avoid traffic would produce the same pollution effect as the Concordes. Singer, now a professor of environmental sciences at U. of Va., called for more study of the effects of Freon and fertilizers and for modification of the engines of future SSTs.

      "story": " Lutz T. Kayser, an aerospace engineer from Stuttgart, Germany, had established a business called Orbital Transport and Raketen A.G. to build and launch rockets on a commercial basis, starting in 1980: if successful, it would be the world\u2019s first private space-launch venture. NASA had been charging at least $25 million to put a $12-million satellite into space; Kayser had designed a \u201cspace truck\u201d to put satellites in orbit for half the NASA price. His rockets could not be used for military purposes, he said, as he had no plans to sell equipment, but would do the launches himself and sell only booster services. As the launches could not take place in crowded West Germany, they would have to be done from either a ship at sea or from a base in some sparsely populated country. After ground tests of Kayser\u2019s rocket engines last summer, German scientists had been convinced that his spacecraft would fly. Kayser said that if the Germans would not support him, he would seek backers elsewhere, in South America or Asia. He had hoped more than half the backing would come from private investors, and the rest from banks. The West German government had spent about $2 billion to encourage German and European space projects that could offer an alternative to the NASA monopoly, but such projects had not succeeded. The first \u201cspace truck\u201d\u2014now under construction for suborbital test next year\u2014would be 39.62 m high and consist of inexpensive conventionally produced materials. To make mass production possible, all stages would use identical engines; the stages would be placed in concentric rings that would drop off as the craft climbed. (ATT, 28 Dec 75, 18)",

      "story": " Pulsars had been discovered to be not only superdense but also superfluid, Columbia University physicists reported in Astrophys-ical Journal. Pulsars, collapsed remnants of exploded stars formed almost entirely of neutrons, had been shown to be so dense that a spoonful would weigh millions of metric tons. Theorists had suspected that such objects, even with a thin rigid crust of iron, would be superfluid\u2014a state produced experimentally on earth in small helium specimens cooled almost to absolute zero, where both friction and viscosity disappear. Material inside such an object, stirred into motion, would swirl indefinitely. The Columbia Univ. experimenters had attempted to measure the surface temperature of a young pulsar, such as the one in the Crab Nebula. If the temperature were less than 8.8 million0C, the object would probably be superfluid; a fast-spinning neutron star would cool rapidly because of its reduced heat capacity. Temperatures of such objects could be detected by x-ray wavelengths, but the x-rays produced could not penetrate earth\u2019s atmosphere. Space observation was necessary, and rockets launched by NASA from Hawaii and N. Mex. tested the Crab nebula pulsar, using the moon as a curtain. As the moon passed across the whole nebula several times, cutting off its various x-ray emissions, the physicists had been able to identify the x-rays indicating temperature. Since the Crab nebula pulsar\u2019s temperature was shown to be less than 5 million °C, the physicists concluded that the pulsar must be superfluid. (ATT, 30 Dec 75, 40)",

Dept, of Natural Resources had approved the first long-range, space-assisted program to develop an \u201cearly warning system\u201d for the onset of red tide, an ocean-borne organism that had left tons of dead fish rotting on beaches around the world. Dr. Warren A. Hovis of GSFC had designed an ocean-color scanner capable of detecting subtle variations in the color of coastal waters that might indicate changes in concentration and species of marine phytoplankton, especially the red-tide dino-flagellate Gymnodinium breve. Red tide had been a major problem because of oxygen depletion in ocean water from fish decomposition, and eye and respiratory infections caused by toxic particles produced in the organism. Shellfish beds affected had been closed for months by authorities. An outbreak of red tide in 1971 had cost the state of Fla. more than $20 million in lost tourist business. The ocean scanner, developed for use in the Nimbus-G pollution-sensing spacecraft scheduled for launch in 1978, could be used in photographic overflights by aircraft and Landsat spacecraft, in connection with on-site sampling of ocean waters by research ships, to detect the organism in time to take countermeasures and warn the public about affected areas. {Spaceflight, Vol 17 No. 12, Dec 75, 425)",

Working through the Intemational Astronomical Union, the scientists had been forced to look beyond the names of scientists and explorers that had been used almost exclusively for objects on the moon and on Mars. A meeting on the problem in Moscow in July 1974 had agreed that objects on Venus would be called after women famous in mythology and history. New maps of the recently photographed surface of Mercury would bear the names of contributors to the arts and other humanities; the scientists had sought advice from scholars in the humanities to get the widest possible representation from past and present cultures. The Moscow meeting on new approaches to names for planetary features had been preceded by intense work on naming newly discovered configurations on the moon and on Mars. A complete scheme of names for more than 500 large formations on the far side of the moon\u2014visible only to spacecraft because one side of the moon had always been turned toward earth\u2014had been approved in 1970. Soviet scientists had rejected suggestions of names from the humanities for features on the moon and on Mars; they had urged a fresh start on Mercury, a new planet, with formations named not only for authors, as the Americans had originally suggested, but also for persons in other branches of the humanities.
