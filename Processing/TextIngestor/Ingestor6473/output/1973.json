Thompson in a New York Times article: The mission had represented a \u201csunset\u201d of rocket technology. \u201cApollo 17 turned the night into day, but elsewhere smaller lights were going on as men began to discover relationships between consciousness and the growth of plants . . . , between enzyme change and faith healing . . . , and between mind and matter in psychokinesis. . . . The space program was an important scaffolding, but now that the building of the new human culture is up, we no longer need the scaffolding.\u201d To spend a fortune on rockets now \u201cwould be the same as spending a fortune on dirigibles in 1916. There are other forms of space travel to be invented, and these forms are more likely to spring from the new paradigms emerging in science than from the hardware of the old technology. The era of the rocket has climaxed in Apollo 17; if we push on and ignore the sense of an ending, we shall find only the bitterness and disappointment of the anticlimax.\u201d (NYT, 1/1/73, 3:13) January 2:\tDr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, expressed gratification in his monthly letter to the staff \u201cwith NASA\u2019s excellent performance in 1972, and with the successful transition . . . from the completed programs of the Sixties to the new programs and new challenges of the Seventies. In 1972, Phase I of the national space effort of the United States was completed and Phase II well begun.\u201d NASA\u2019s first year with all launches and missions successful underlined that it was NASA\u2019s custom \u201cto do the unprecedented and then quickly make it routine.\u201d Zero failures could now be the goal year after year. Dr. Fletcher also noted that of 18 space launches in 1972 half had been for other organizations or countries, with 8 being reimbursed. On another \u201cimportant front,\u201d the NASA-wide payload cost-reduction campaign begun in 1972 had gone well, with valuable suggestions from Centers and contractors. The effort \u201cwas not a routine cutback exercise and not a threat to anyone\u2019s security. It is, instead, a creative effort to expand our usefulness even though funds are limited. And you can be sure it has a lot to do with NASA\u2019s long-range survival as the instrument of the U.S. Government to handle most kinds of space and aeronautical r&d and other related assignments.\u201d (NASA Activities, 1/15/73, 2-3)",

Statendam, which left New York Dec. 4 for Cape Kennedy and the Caribbean. Mailer had said: \u201cMoon colonies offer the possibility that we\u2019ll be able to discover definitively and for the first time what we are doing wrong. Whether we thrive on the moon or fail we\u2019re going to learn something that we\u2019re not going to learn by staying here on earth. . . .\u201d Part of \u201cthe fundamental impasse of 20th-century man and woman is that they cannot find communities which express their philosophical ideas, their social ideas, and their private ideas. In other words, the one thing that we can\u2019t do any longer is verify what we think. We can have ideas. But we spend our lives just talking about them. \u201cThere are very few people who have a profound sense of commitment. One of the reasons that the astronauts have been so revered . . . is that they have this huge sense of commitment. . . . they are absolutely devoted to a living a life that they believe in utterly and are willing to go through great hardship for it. I think that until our society reaches the point where many more people live lives of such commitment it\u2019s going to remain essentially unhealthy. . . . \u201cThe decision to go to the moon is such a declaration of intent. If nothing else, one has to risk dying on it. One has to recognize that one is taking a major step, and the idea of taking a major step brings out in, people at least for a short period . . . the best in them. Then, if there\u2019s something really alive in the venture, they\u2019re likely to keep changing their habits and go on to make more of themselves.\u201d Miss Porter had said that, in almost anything men undertook together here on the earth, \u201cin no time at all there\u2019s a pull and haul for power. They\u2019re betraying and tricking each other, getting in one another\u2019s way.

On Jan. 12 Luna 21 entered lunar orbit with 110-km (68.4-mi) apolune, 90-km (55.9-mi) perilune, 1-hr 58-min period, and 60° inclination. Orbital corrections were made Jan. 13 and 14 and on Jan. 14 the spacecraft was placed in an elliptical orbit with a low point of 16 km (10 mi) from the moon\u2019s surface. Luna 21 softlanded on the eastern fringe of the Sea of Serenity Jan. 16 (Jan. 15 est) and released the 840-kg (1850-lb) self-propelled Lunokhod 2 vehicle to make scientific investigations of the moon\u2019s surface. Lunokhod 2 resembled its predecessor, Lunokhod 1 (placed on the moon Nov. 17, 1970, by Luna 17). It carried flags, pennants with Lenin\u2019s has relief, state coat of arms, and the inscription \u201c50th Anniversary of the U.S.S.R.\u201d and was equipped with a control system, radio and TV devices, and scientific instruments including a French-made laser reflector. The reflector was designed to measure the distance between the earth and the moon to within 20-30 cm (10-12 in). Between Jan. 16 and Jan. 23 Lunokhod 2, powered by solar batteries and controlled from the ground by a special crew, photographed the lunar soil, rocks, and panoramic moonscape; determined chemical composition of the surface layer; measured the glow of zodiacal light near sun; and looked for cosmic dust. A highly skilled ground crew maneuvered vehicle over the shortest and safest routes, orienting it to a complex relief map of route. Lunokhod 2 was turned to bypass obstacles without decreasing speed. On Jan. 23 Lunokhod 2 was commanded to terminate operations in preparation for lunar night. Luna 17 was the first unmanned spacecraft to land on the moon and deploy an automatic lunar explorer. The last mission in the series, the unmanned Luna 20 (launched Feb. 14, 1972), had landed on the moon and returned to earth with lunar samples, (gsfc SSR, 1/31/73; Tass fbis-Sov, 1/8/73, LI; 1/15-19/73, LI; 1/22-23/73, LI; 1/26/73, 4; SBD, 1/9/73, 38; Shabad, NYT, 1/17/73, C14) January 8:\tDr. Rocco A.

Transceivers had been used in lunar modules for Apollo rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. The U.S. also would build a receiver for Apollo spacecraft that could operate on Soviet communication frequencies and might lend to the U.S.S.R. equipment for use by cosmonauts and astronauts during joint portions of mission. Dr. Petrone had said NASA engineers, in discussions with Soviet engineers, had noted that necessity of concentrating on interpreter for exchange of technical information had made them more aware of technical problems than they would have been in direct English conversation. March meeting of U.S. and Soviet ASTP planners would consider flammability problems. (Av Wk, 1/8/73,",

The budget projection for the succeeding fiscal year was included for first time, with the FY 1975 budget estimated at $288 billion. The national total for FY 1974 included an R&D budget of $17.4 billion (an increase of $300 million), with $3.1 billion requested for civilian and military space programs. Emphasis was on practical, immediate results from R&D rather than expanding scientific knowledge, with reduced priority for space research. The total request for NASA new obligational authority of $3,016 billion (1.2% of the total U.S. budget) was $391 million less than the FY 1973 noa of $3,407 billion. FY 1973 funds of $91 million were to be carried over to FY 1974. NASA expenditures were budgeted to increase $74 million, from $3,062 billion in FY 1973 to $3,136 billion. The FY 1973 increase of $11 million had been largely for space shuttle engine and airframe design and development. Of the FY 1974 budget request, $2,288 billion would go for R&D, $112 million for construction of facilities, and $707 million for research and program management. In manned space flight, elimination of Apollo funding reflected successful completion of the Apollo program with the Apollo 17 mission. Manned space flight operations\u2014including $233.8 million for Skylab; $90 million for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp) ; $220.2 million for development, test, and mission operations; $21 million for space life sciences; and $15.5 million for mission systems and integration\u2014 would decrease from $879 million in FY 1973 to $580.5 million. The decrease reflected removal of space shuttle funding from the manned spacecraft operations category to separate program status. The FY 1974 budget request allocated $475 million to the space shuttle program for the orbiter, main engine, solid-fueled rocket boosters, external tanks, technology and related development, and vehicle and engine definition. Advanced missions would receive $1.5 million, to bring the total for manned space flight (including the shuttle) to $1,057 billion, down $100 million from FY 1973. Funding for space science programs would decrease $95.2 million, from $679.2 million in FY 1973 to $584 million in FY 1974. The decrease reflected suspension of the High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) program, in which two flights had originally been scheduled during 1976-1978. The physics and astronomy program would receive $95 million, down from $126.2 million; lunar and planetary exploration would receive $312 million, down from $331.9 million; and launch vehicle procurement would receive $177 million, down from $221 million. NASA\u2019s space applications programs would receive $153 million (a decrease of $35.7 million), including $51 million for weather and climate research with satellites, meteorological soundings, experimental instruments and techniques, and for the Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp) ; $13.9 million for pollution monitoring, including $9 million for Nimbus-G oceanographic and air pollution observation satellite; $42.6 million for earth resources survey; $10.7 million for earth and ocean physics; $3.1 million for space processing; $22.1 million for communications, including a multi-use communications experiment satellite (ats-f) and a Canadian Cooperative Satellite (cas-c) ; $3 million for a multidisciplinary Earth Observing Satellite (eos) ; $4.5 million for shuttle experiment definition; and $2 million for application studies. The total requested for NASA\u2019s aeronautics and space technology programs increased from $232.5 million in FY 1973 to $240 million. Aeronautical research and technology funding would increase from $150.6 million in FY 1973 to $171 million, including $22 million for experimental engine programs, $9.3 million for flight experiment programs, and $30 million for system technology programs. Space research and technology would receive $65 million, and nuclear power and propulsion $4 million (a drop from $17.1 million). Tracking and data acquisition funding would rise from $248.3 million in FY 1973 to $250 million. The Dept, of Defense FY 1974 budget of $85 billion was at an1 all-time high,\t$4.1\tbillion above the\tFY 1973 budget\tauthority, but was 28.4% of\ttotal Federal outlays for\tFY 1974 (a\tpercentage decrease from 29.0% in FY 1973 and the lowest proportion since 1950) and 6.0% of the\tgross\tnational product\t(the lowest\tGNP\tpercentage in 24 yrs, down\tfrom\t6.2% in FY 1973). The dod\ttotal\tincluded $8.7 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (rdt&e), a $600 million increase over FY 1973. Of the requested rdt&e total, military astronautics\u2014with major programs including military comsats, the first spaceborne ballistic missile early warning system, a prototype satellite to demonstrate precise navigation capabilities, continued flight experiment programs, and technology programs in advanced navigation, guidance, sensors, cooling, reentry, and propulsion\u2014would receive $604.6 million (up $169.9 million). Military sciences would receive $509.8 million (up $13.7 million). Aircraft rdt&e would receive $1,787 billion (down $86 million), and missiles rdt&e $2,245 billion (up $143 million). Major DOD increases were programmed for the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile system ($1,712 billion, up $917 million), new Air Force F\u20144J jet fighter aircraft ($131 million), CVN-70 aircraft carrier ($657 million, up $358 million) and F-15 air superiority fighter ($1,148 billion, up $240 million). Decreases of $198 million in funding for the Safeguard antiballistic missile system, $208 million for the Poseidon missile, and $64 million for the short-range attack missile (sram) reflected a modernization program, as dod continued the transition from combat support in Southeast Asia to strengthening baseline forces. The Dept, of Transportation budget request of $9,025 billion was a decrease of $2,302 billion from FY 1973. dot funding would continue a 10-yr, $10-billion program to improve urban mass transportation and reduce highway congestion. Federal Aviation Administration funding of $2,126 billion would continue efforts to reduce aircraft noise, ensure that advanced aircraft engines did not adversely affect the upper atmosphere, and design a safer and more productive airport system. The Atomic Energy Commission FY 1974 budget request of $3,066 billion, up $382 million over FY 1973, would cover production of nuclear materials to make electricity and for use in nuclear weapons and as nuclear reactor fuel, research into availability of source materials, operation safety, and development of techniques for long-term storage of radioactive waste. The National Science Foundation FY 1974 budget request of $582.6 million was down $63.1 million from FY 1973, but r&d funding would increase from $510.3 million in FY 1973 to $554.1 million. Programs would emphasize research into domestic problems, problems of long-range national interest, and effects of R&D on the economy. Priorities would include development of solar power as an energy source and of tunneling technology for urban use under the Research Applied to National Needs (rann) program and development of a very-large-array radioastronomy facility. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (in the Dept, of Commerce) budget request of $343.0 million, down from $366.7 million in FY 1973, would permit continued improvements in weather monitoring, prediction, and warning; continuation of its polar orbiting satellite system and implementation of a two-geostationary satellite system in the weather satellite program; major hurricane modification research; and expansion of research on marine ecosystems analysis to determine effects of ocean dumping. The Environmental Protection Agency budget request of $148.7 million was down from $173.1 million in FY 1973.

      "story": " Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released the statement given out at the nasa FY 1974 budget briefing held Jan. 27: \u201cThe budget the President has approved for NASA for FY 1974, like those of other agencies, has been reduced substantially below previous plans and expectations to hold total government spending to the targets set by the President. At the same time, the budget will permit NASA to carry forward a substantial and significant program in space and aeronautics.\u201d The budget provided for continuing the major projects in the schedule announced Jan. 5 and for starting two new projects: Nimbus-G, \u201canother in NASA\u2019s series of experimental earth oriented satellites, which will be directed at environmental pollution and oceanographic measurements, and LAGEOS, a new geodetic satellite for extremely accurate measurements of movements of the earth\u2019s surface.\u201d In addition to reductions in programs announced Jan. 5, the budget required \u201cthat we stretch out schedules in a number of ongoing projects. The second Earth Resources Technology Satellite (erts-b) will be delayed two years, until 1976. This will allow it to carry an additional sensor. Tiros-N, the prototype of a new series of operational meteorological satellites for the National Weather Service, will be delayed by about one year to 1977. \u201cWe will also undergo another belt-tightening in NASA. By the end of FY 1974 our civil service complement will be reduced 1880 positions below the FY 1973 end strength approved in the FY 1973 budget. This reduction includes the previously announced reductions related to the termination of our nuclear programs.\u201d Despite a \u201csharp decrease from the level budget anticipated last year,\u201d Dr. Fletcher was \u201cvery pleased with the program content we were able to retain. Clearly from what has been said today and on January 5, we will have to curtail several activities that are of major importance to the nation.\u201d But \u201cwe have been able to keep NASA\u2019s main line program essentially intact and each of the programs curtailed will still be done, either at a later date than anticipated or in an alternate way to that planned last year. Although I, personally, would like to see a higher NASA budget, I believe we can capitalize on the belt-tightening required to produce even greater yield for the tax dollar in future years.\u201d NASA was \u201cmaking substantial efforts to reduce future costs . . . while still giving the nation a strong program in space and aeronautics.\u201d Additionally, a prime object of the space shuttle program was to reduce costs of operating in space. NASA intended to \u201cdevelop and introduce new design concepts and management approaches which, together with the relaxed weight and size constraints of the Space Shuttle, will result in substantially lower development and operating costs.\u201d NASA Comptroller William E. Lilly discussed personnel cutbacks necessitated by the new budgetary limitations. The total NASA Civil Service reduction of 1880 positions would include a Marshall Space Flight Center cut of 650; Goddard Space Flight Center, 158; Kennedy Space Center, 100; Manned Spacecraft Center, 75; Wallops Station, 17; Lewis Research Center, 660; nasa Hq., 150; and Ames, Langley, and Flight Research Centers, a total of 70. From a peak Civil Service complement of more than 34 000 in 1967, nasa would be reduced to under 25 000 employees by June 1974\u2014a drop of 30%. Total employees from all sources\u2014contract and in-house\u2014would drop from the 1966 peak of 420 000 to about 100 000. (Text; Transcript)",

The U.S. expected to have spent $70 billion by June 30 on combined civilian and military space programs. Physical evidence of Soviet space activity indicated the U.S.S.R. had committed a similar amount. There had been no manned Soviet launches in 1972. Moscow had been \u201cfilled with rumors\u201d in late July of an impending \u201cmore ambitious Salyut-Soyuz manned mission,\u201d but press reports had indicated later that tracking ships which usually supported such missions were returning to port.

Federal expenditures for research and development were expected to grow faster than total Federal outlays in FY 1973 for the first time since FY 1965. Between FY 1972 and 1973 r&d expenditures were expected to rise 3.6%, with total outlays up 2.6%. The Federal R&D percentage of the total was expected to be 7.3% in FY 1973. Of total outlays for space research and technology, 98% was expected to go toward R&D, but the R&D share of the total outlay for international affairs and finance, veterans benefits and services, general government, and income security would be less than 1%. Functions other than national defense and space R&T had increased emphasis on R&D significantly 1963-1973, from 10% to an expected 23%. The trend toward more civilian-oriented programs within the Federal r&d total was continuing, with an expected rise of 2% between 1972 and 1973. (Text)",

Visitors included scientists from the U.S.S.R. who presented papers on Apollo lunar samples received from the U.S. At the opening session Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator said, \u201cI can see at least a decade of fruitful analysis, synthesis, and integration of the information locked up in the material brought back and still coming back from the scientific stations left on the moon\u201d in the Apollo program. Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg, California Institute of Technology scientist, described \u201clunar cataclysm.\u201d Lunar dust brought back by Apollo astronauts had been estimated to be as old as 4.5 billion yrs. But most lunar rocks were less than 4 billion yrs old and none were younger than 3 billion yrs. The best explanation was that 3.9 billion yrs ago the moon was battered and bombarded on an unprecedented scale, creating so much heat that old rocks were destroyed and a new generation of rocks was created. Since then the moon might have experienced minor volcanic eruptions but nothing like that period of cataclysm. Some scientists believed the moon had cooled and gone into a period of hibernation. Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer of the State Univ. of New York said even the orange soil found by Apollo 17 astronauts had turned out to be 3.71 billion yrs old, an age disappointing to scientists who had believed the moon had been formed by more recent volcanic activity. Dr. Keith A. Howard, U.S. Geological Survey geologist, compared the lunar landslide found near the Apollo 17 landing site to a large, high-velocity avalanche on earth. Dr. Howard suggested that gas within the lunar soil had been released during the slide. Apollo 17 samples would be searched for evidence of fluids. One Apollo 17 instrument placed on the lunar surface had made an atom-by-atom search for evidence of lunar atmosphere. Although the moon had no atmosphere, traces of argon, neon, and helium had been found. Dr. John H. Hoffman, associate professor of physics at the Univ. of Texas, said only argon appeared to have been generated from the moon\u2019s interior. Neon and helium apparently had been deposited by the solar wind. Conference attendees unanimously voted to congratulate NASA on completion of the Apollo program by sending a letter to Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator: The conception, design, and implementation of lunar exploration represented \u201can extraordinary human and technological achievement.\u201d To explore another planet, it had been necessary for man \u201cto achieve many successive levels of technological capability and to surpass formidable barriers. This was accomplished brilliantly by the dedicated engineers and astronauts of NASA in conjunction with skilled management. On this technical base a new branch of science has been built.\u201d (Transcript; Goddard News, 3/73, 2; jsc Roundup, 3/16/73, 1; NASA Activities, 4/15/73, 67) March 5-9:\tMore than 1000 administrators, congressmen, and government, industry, and university scientists attended the Erts 1 Earth Resources and Technology Satellite Symposium sponsored by Goddard Space Flight Center in New Carrollton, Md.

Dr. Marian Baumgardner, scientist at the Purdue Univ. Laboratory for the Applications of Remote Sensing, said results from Erts 1 study of semi-arid regions suggested that the satellite could identify and map vegetative, species, and management differences in range lands; gross soil patterns and differences related to agricultural and land-use-management problems and practices; areas of surface water and changes related to ground water recharge; crop damage by hail and windstorms; and areas of bare soil and related problems of erosion and conservation.

      "story": " The House Committee on Science and Astronautics\u2019 Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology opened its hearings on the FY 1974 nasa authorization. Rep. Ken Hechler (D-W. Va.), Committee Chairman, said the Subcommittee would be particularly concerned with \u201cthe extent of progress toward the enunciation of a national aeronautics and aviation policy.\u201d The Subcommittee had been partially responsible, he said, for the reduction of emphasis on aeronautics because it was \u201cnot aggressive enough in its insistence that more emphasis be placed on aeronautics during . . . the late I950\u2019s when the Committee was first established, and the early 1960\u2019s when the tremendous emphasis on space tended to push aeronautics . . . into the background.\u201d Roy P. Jackson, nasa Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology, testified that reorientation of NASA\u2019s space and aeronautical programs to meet changing national goals had been completed \u201cwithout jeopardizing the continuing development of a broad base for new knowledge, and the potential for meeting future, but presently unseen, needs.\u201d In the oast aeronautics program the research and technology base took priority over experimental programs. The R&T base was \u201cwork that is unparalleled in the U.S. It is the data base from which springs new ideas for development in the future.\u201d When faced with the necessity to cut expenditures, \u201cwe had to consider primarily a reduction in our work on flight experiments and experimental programs.\u201d Among examples of meeting future needs, hydrogen as a long-term aircraft fuel for the distant future was a \u201cconcept of potential major importance to the reduction of air pollution, while simultaneously conserving our increasingly scarce petroleum reserves.\u201d Hydrogen eliminated hydrocarbon pollution and was \u201ca more efficient fuel, but the reduction of NOx [oxides of nitrogen] may require additional effort.\u201d The \u201cearliest likely commercial use of hydrogen as an aircraft fuel will be about 15 to 20 years hence.\u201d Hydrogen was \u201ca low-density, cryogenic fuel which represents problems of relatively large, insulated tanks, the need for materials to keep their strength through wide temperature variations, very low temperature hardware including pumps, valves, seals and associated maintenance. In addition to cost, hydrogen is difficult to store and transport. . . . Our experience with the practical use of liquid hydrogen in NASA\u2019s space program suggests that there will be some complexities to solve but these should not be insurmountable.\u201d Dr. Seymour C. Himmel, Deputy Associate Administrator for Technology in OAST, reported on the quiet, clean, short-haul experimental engine (qcsee) program to integrate and demonstrate technology required for an environmentally acceptable and economical powered-lift propulsion system, \u201cqcsee will utilize a basic existing engine core, modified as required to mate with specially designed low-pressure spool fans and turbines to build up an experimental engine. This, together with appropriate flight-type acoustic nacelles and wing section installations, will be tested for noise and performance and operating characteristics. The design and test program will provide the technology base needed to help guide Government . . . environmental rulemaking and to provide industry with data to evaluate propulsion concept effectiveness and development risks.\u201d George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs in OAST, described the status of aeronautics programs after revisions necessitated by FY 1974 budget restrictions. The General Electric Co. quiet engine contract had been completed and both engines delivered to NASA. Engines A and C were scheduled for extensive in-house research programs at Lewis Research Center. An in-house study underway at LeRC would determine the technical value of another contracted effort, for a second-generation quiet engine. \u201cIn the meantime, we are working to generate component noise design and performance data, so that a significant noise reduction below that demonstrated by the first Quiet Engine can be obtained in any future engine program. No important area in aeronautical propulsion has been terminated, although funding levels for certain portions of the aeronautics programs have been readjusted based on a review of priorities. The F-8 high-speed supercritical wing verification project was not cut back or terminated. During FY 1973, the project was completed according to plan. The results were very encouraging and gave confidence as to wind-tunnel test results at transonic speeds.\u201d A follow-on to the F-8 was under study. Depending upon results, a follow-on F-8 flight-test program might be undertaken in FY 1975. (Transcript)",

We expect that this location will be identified when the solid fueled rocket booster contract is awarded this November.\u201d Philip E. Culbertson, Director of Mission and Payload Integration in omsf, contrasted a typical operational communications satellite program using expendable launch vehicles with one using the space shuttle. Launched on the Titan IIIB-Centaur launch vehicle, each spacecraft was estimated at 467 kg (1030 lbs). To fulfill 1979-1990 requirements for reliable communications services, 26 spacecraft would be required. Use of the Titan IIIB-Centaur would require 26 new spacecraft and 26 new launch vehicles, at an average cost for each flight of $25.8 million. \u201cIf the same program is carried out using the Shuttle and Tug, the cost changes significantly. First, with the Shuttle we can apply the low cost approaches to payload design. We are no longer constrained by weight limitations; therefore, we can ruggedize the spacecraft structure, simplify the design and verification test program, and thus reduce both development and unit spacecraft cost.\u201d The shuttle and tug combination could deploy and retrieve 2 satellites on a single flight, making 13 flights to deploy 26 spacecraft\u201410 new and 16 refurbished. On 8 of these flights 2 spacecraft would be deployed and retrieved. \u201cThe total cost for conducting the program would be $14.9 million per spacecraft flight, compared to the $25.8 million for the expendable approach\u2014a savings of 42 percent.\u201d m/g Robert H.

The att system studies have shown that by the early 1980\u2019s a new subsonic/sonic transport\u2014quieter, cleaner, safer, and more economical than the current wide-body jet transports\u2014could be realized through technology advances which could be ready for commitment to application late in the 1970\u2019s. These advances would include supercritical aerodynamics and related configuration treatment, techniques for suppression of engine noise and emissions, composite structures, and active control systems.\u201d The studies would be extended in FY 1974 \u201cby concentrating more heavily on the system improvement tradeoffs, and corresponding technology, involved in optimizing design for efficient terminal operations as well as cruise performance.\u201d An analysis and wind-tunnel test program would investigate the sources and the reduction of airframe noise. \u201cRecent studies and flight tests have indicated that as we continue to reduce engine source noise, it may also be necessary ... to treat airframe noise.\u201d Further testing of airframe shielding and analyses would determine the operational and economic feasibility of new concepts like the yawed-wing, low-supersonic design being investigated at Ames Research Center. Propulsion technology programs underway would examine further noise reduction potential than that already being demonstrated in the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft experimental quiet engine program. When results were promising, plans for a follow-on CTOL experimental quiet engine, Mark II, would be developed.

Himmel, Deputy Associate Administrator for Technology in oast, testified that hypersonic research for potential application to military and civil airbreathing cruise vehicles was directed at \u201cthe critical aspects of propulsion, structures, and aerodynamics for this flight regime where hydrogen is used both as the fuel and as a coolant.\u201d Hydrogen was the most likely candidate for hypersonic aircraft fuel because its high coolant capacity was essential for a propulsion system to survive in the high-temperature environment, and liquid hydrogen\u2019s coolant capacity could cool portions of the vehicle\u2019s structure away from the engine area. NASA\u2019s structures and materials program provided essential technology for designing lightweight, reliable, actively cooled structures and advanced the technology of actively cooling structures heated to high temperatures.

One third had been used for the successful launchings of seven satellites but the remainder had been spent on an expensive and yet unsuccessful booster. Interest in the booster had dissipated despite the French desire to continue and the offer to pay for 60% to 70% of the costs. At two European conferences on space (December 1971 and December 1972) plans were made to merge ELDO and ESRO into a single agency and to allow member nations to cooperate with NASA on building a sortie lab for the space shuttle. France had threatened to leave ESRO unless more emphasis was placed on applications satellites and ESRO closed its plasma laboratory in Italy and its sounding rocket range in Sweden. France had also insisted that more use be made of national facilities and teams rather than esro\u2019s technical center. Final agreements and objectives on a European applications satellite could not be made because of the conflicting interests of each nation. Nor could it be decided what role national programs should play. But Europe had successfully launched 26 satellites and had acquired an industrial competence which could easily provide a firm basis for more ambitious projects. (Science, 3/9/73, 984-986)",

Mercury. If all goes well, we will make our deepest penetration toward the sun and get our first view of the sun-scorched Mercury. Pioneer G is ready for shipment to Cape Kennedy. It will be launched in April 1973 and will follow Pioneer 10 [launched March 2, 1972] through the asteroid belt to explore Jupiter. \u201cWe are proceeding with the development of the two Mariner spacecraft planned for launch to Jupiter and Saturn in 1977. The experiments and experiment teams have been selected. We are proceeding also with spacecraft design and will be purchasing some of the subsystems\u2014those common to Viking\u2014in Fiscal Year 1974. The use of common subsystems and leftover Viking hardware is helping us to minimize costs on this project. The major manned mission of 1973 is . . . Skylab, which will have many scientific experiments aboard. The most important and the largest ... is the Apollo Telescope Mount (atm), which contains five major experiments using eight scientific instruments, all devoted to observing and studying the sun. This complex assembly of solar instruments is designed to be man-operated in a manner similar to a ground-based observatory. The atm is now assembled as part of Skylab, awaiting launch in May 1973. An international campaign of solar observations in 15 countries . . . will be run simultaneously with ATM; a number of sounding-rocket payloads will be launched to help calibrate the instruments on atm and to make complementary observations.\u201d Oso 7, in orbit, \u201cmade many unique observations during the August 1972 period of intense solar activity and made the first observations of gamma rays in solar flares, oso-i is planned to be launched late in 1974. It will carry several major experiments to make detailed measurements of the process that transports energy from the sun\u2019s surface to its intensely hot corona. The broad international participation in oso-i is exemplified by a major French instrument and by a group of over 40 guest investigators from the U.S., France, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R.\u201d Associate Administrator for Applications Charles W. Mathews testified on special applications programs: \u201cThe Earth and Ocean Physics Applications Program (eopap) is an interrelated series of projects directed to the solution of important problems in earth and ocean dynamics that can best be addressed by the application of space techniques. Major areas of eopap are (a) global monitoring, reporting and forecasting of ocean-surface conditions and (b) monitoring of motions of the whole earth and its crust to obtain a better understanding of the processes that produce earthquakes, with the expectation that this will lead to the development of techniques for predicting the occurrence, magnitude and location of earthquakes.\u201d The second special program underway, the space-processing applications program, was \u201corganized to exploit the unique environment of space flight, weightlessness and unlimited vacuum, for research and technological developments in material sciences and processing with the specific goal of inventing, developing and commercializing new products and manufacturing techniques for use on earth or in space.\u201d NASA\u2019s role was \u201cthat of an initiator of new technology and, following a suitable \u2018incubation period,\u2019 a supplier of supporting services to a developing area of commercial endeavor.\u201d (Transcript)",

Schmitt testified on the legacy of the Apollo program before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics\u2019 Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight in hearings on NASA\u2019s FY 1974 authorization: As man emerged \u201cfrom the scientific revolution brought about by Apollo on the Moon with the simultaneous revolution brought about by new insight into the origins of ocean basins and continents on the Earth, we may begin to understand the great stresses and strains within our crust as ocean floors grow and continents move. These stresses and strains profoundly affect the everyday lives of people living within belts of present earthquakes and volcanic activity. Within future understanding of the frozen ocean of basalt of [Oceanus] Procellarum and the vast ridge and volcanic system that splits it, may lie the simplification of thought about past events that leads to the expansion of thoughts about present events. I will be the first to admit that these last comments give free run to the imagination. However, knowledge never becomes a resource until it is married to imagination. It is thus . . . that the scientific legacy of Apollo will be realized.\u201d Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Marshall Space Flight Center Director and former Apollo Program Director, reported the status of the five scientific stations deployed on the moon during the Apollo program: The first station deployed by Apollo 12, in November 1969, \u201cis still functioning over 3 years after its initial deployment in the very demanding environment of the Moon. . . . The fact that this equipment can stand these rigors of temperature and vacuum . . . and still function . . . demonstrates one facet of the technology we have developed.\u201d All five stations were still functioning, though some of the experiments had been lost. The first total station, on Apollo 12, had been designed for a one-year life. \u201cAnd yet we have had it over 3 years . . . and the seismometers worked beautifully all 3 years.\u201d The superthermal ion detector was \u201cworking beautifully and had for 3 years, night and day.\u201d NASA had \u201cfive seismic units just giving us beautiful information on the seismic tremors of the Moon and meteorite impacts, so now we can locate them fairly accurately.\u201d Dr. Charles A. Berry, Director of Life Sciences in OMSF, reported: \u201cWe are vastly wiser in many medical and technical areas for our \u2018decade in space.\u2019 Much has been learned about the effects of the space flight environment upon man. We have found that some body systems respond to space flight factors . . . with changes . . . observable in the period immediately following space flight. Occasionally changes have been noticeable during the inflight period of the mission. None of these changes has been of such a severity as to cause any real concern for man\u2019s safety in space, but all changes are . . . being watched closely lest they have implications for long duration flight.\u201d Cardiovascular responses which showed the greatest changes also appeared most amenable to regulation by inflight countermeasures, such as lower body negative pressure. Medication had not proved of value in treating either the cardiovascular deconditioning or the loss of exercise capacity. Countermeasures were also being investigated for the small bone density losses noted. A decrease in heart size had been noted in both U.S. and Soviet space crewmen and some Soviet crewmen had experienced postflight muscular difficulties. \u201cBoth astronauts and cosmonauts have also reported sensations resembling sea sickness during spaceflight. On the whole, however, U.S. astronauts do not appear to be excessively plagued by motion sickness symptoms.

Dr. Fletcher pointed out that the NASA request of $3,016 billion was down $400 million from FY 1973 but said the agency program was significant. In 1972 NASA had completed the transition from manned exploration to a focus on practical benefits, unmanned exploration, and development of the space shuttle \u201cas the means to make more practical and more economical all future uses of space, unmanned and manned, especially for applications of economic, commercial, international, or national security significance.\u201d Work on uses of the shuttle was \u201creinforcing our view that the Space Shuttle system will not only provide the launch capability needed for future space activities of all types but will revolutionize the ways in which space is used as well. The more the specialists in various fields look at the shuttle\u2019s capabilities, especially in the sortie mode, the more they see how its weight and volume capacity and flexible operations will permit them to carry out experiments and useful applications in a much simpler and economical manner.\u201d Assistant Administrator for Institutional Management Joseph F.

McCurdy, Associate Administrator for Organization and Management, in a prepared statement: \u201cWe are already well into the organization and operation of a comprehensive program to identify specific employee preferences and abilities and corresponding suitable potential employers. We have set up training for staff members in gathering job information and in counseling employees, and have arranged for a coordinated flow of information about job openings throughout NASA, and other Federal agencies, state and local government units, educational institutions and private industry. . . . Rut even more basic ... is our recognition that these people represent a virtually irreplaceable national resource.\u201d He referred not only to \u201cthis highly talented and trained professional-technical work force but also to the complex of sophisticated plant and equipment which must be partially idled. ... It would be unconscionable to permit key elements of America\u2019s aeronautics and space capability to be disbanded or retired without making every effort to keep them available for further service to the nation.\u201d Dr. George M.

Teams assisted local, state and Federal Government agencies in biomedicine, air and water pollution, fire safety, transportation, housing, law enforcement, postal service, and mine safety. \u201cThose teams work with the user to explore important technical problems in his specific field and then, often with the help of specialists at NASA field centers, search for aerospace technology which can be used in the solution of the problems.\u201d A technique used by NASA to inspect space vehicles had been adapted to improve the x-ray diagnosis of tumors and cardiovascular problems, with a tenfold reduction in radiation dosage.

And, while the Soviet Union has enormous advantage in air defense, without an extensive ABM [antiballistic missile] defense . . . the air defense could be substantially undercut by ballistic missile attack, particularly ... a large number of mirvs.\u201d The U.S. advantages were transitory, resting on a \u201ctechnological lead that has been steadily narrowing over the past decade.\u201d With the momentum of the Soviet offensive research and development program, \u201cwe cannot preclude the possibility that our technological lead in this area may further diminish or disappear altogether during the current decade.\u201d Adm.

(Text) April 3-May 28:\tThe U.S.S.R. launched unmanned Salyut 2 scientific space station from Baykonur Cosmodrome into orbit with 260-km (161.6-mi) apogee, 215-km (133.6-mi) perigee, 89-min period, and 51.6° inclination. The Soviet news agency Tass announced objectives were to perfect design, onboard systems, and equipment and to conduct scientific and technical experiments in space flight. Tass said systems were functioning normally. Western observers speculated that a manned spacecraft would be launched to dock with Salyut 2 and establish a manned orbital workshop, resuming Soviet manned space flight after a two-year hiatus. The large Soviet tracking ships Gagarin and Komarov had been sighted in March moving from the Black Sea toward positions in the Atlantic Ocean. On April 11 Tass confirmed earlier U.S. press reports that Salyut 2 had been maneuvered into a higher orbit. April 4 and 8 maneuvers had raised it to a 296-km (183.9-mi) apogee and 261-km (162.2-mi) perigee, with an 89.8-min period and a 51.6° inclination. Stable radio communication was being maintained and the \u201cimproved design of onboard systems and instruments\u201d was being tested. Tass said systems and instruments were functioning normally. The new orbit, out of normal range of a manned Soyuz spacecraft, indicated to some observers a holding orbit because of delay in launching cosmonauts to join the station. Tracking data showed an increase in the number of fragments following the spacecraft after April 14. By the end of the month Goddard Space Flight Center listed 27 objects, of which 25 had reentered the atmosphere. On April 18 Moscow sources said the U.S.S.R. had no plans for a manned flight to link with the space station and that Salyut 2 was carrying out experiments in connection with the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz mission planned for 1975. Earlier Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of the cosmonaut training project, had said Salyut laboratories could gather information for weather forecasting, geology, transport, communications, agriculture, and environmental protection\u2014 without mentioning manned flight. By April 25 U.S. observers suspected that an April 14 failure, possibly an explosion or a wildly firing thruster, had sent the station tumbling end over end, tearing off the four solar panels and damaging the compartment, making cosmonaut manning of the station impossible. Radio signals from Salyut 2 were reported to have ceased. On April 28 Tass reported that Salyut 2 had \u201cconcluded the programme of flight\u201d and that the data obtained in the experiments confirmed \u201cthe correctness of design and structural decisions and the properties chosen for the main systems and on-board equipment of the station. These data will be used in building a new spacecraft.\u201d The spacecraft reentered May 28. Salyut 1, the world\u2019s first experimental orbiting workshop, had been launched April 19, 1971. A three-man crew\u2014launched aboard Soyuz 10 April 23, 1971\u2014had docked with Salyut 1 but did not board, returning to earth after two days in space. Three more cosmonauts\u2014launched on Soyuz 11 June 6, 1971\u2014docked, boarded the station, and conducted scientific experiments for 23 days. During their return to earth in Soyuz 11 June 30, they died after a valve accidentally opened and evacuated the air from the spacecraft compartment. A second Salyut was believed by Western observers to have been launched in July 1972 without achieving orbit, (gsfc SSR: 4/30/73; 5/23/73.

A program memorandum on dod shuttle use, to be coordinated with NASA, would include plans for early entry into the shuttle program, identify key dod planning milestones, and treat funding and management issues. dod would \u201cplace increased emphasis on new concepts of payload design and operation . . . essential to achieving the Shuttle\u2019s full potential for more effective, less costly space operations.\u201d Goals of dod planning and coordination were to ensure that NASA knew and understood dod needs so that the shuttle would be of maximum utility to dod, to provide data essential to integrated planning and support decisions on future shuttle use, to explore ways to benefit most from the shuttle\u2019s unique capabilities, and to coordinate dod shuttle activities with NASA to the best possible use of both agencies. The dod Shuttle-User Committee had been established as \u201ca focal point for our broad and varied interests in the future military use of space.\u201d The Committee, under Air Force chairmanship, included representatives of other military departments and the Joint Chiefs of Staff; NASA would be invited to provide an observer. The Committee would guide studies of payloads and missions, explore the transition from launching dod payloads with expendable vehicles to using the shuttle, and possibly would identify experimental dod payloads to be carried on shuttle research and development flights for NASA. DOD\u2019s FY 1974 space program budget request of $1.6 million, $205 million more than in FY 1973, would reduce the vulnerability of the Transit navigation satellite system; procure spacecraft and boosters for the Fleet Satellite Communications (fltsatcom) System and the Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs) ; cover research and development costs of early-warning general support; and increase supporting r&d for the space test program, for advanced surveillance technology for earth-limb-measurement satellites, and for a joint-service navigation satellite experiment.

Its effects on Earth are permanent and pervasive. Not just the hundreds of thousands of jobs it provided, the schools and homes it caused to be built, and the economic impact of the program itself; not just the invaluable accretion of scientific knowledge; not just the restoration of faith in American technological leadership\u2014but a radical and enduring upgrading of technological capability throughout American industry. It is such advances that have enabled the United States to retain its preeminence in high technology production. And it is the continuation of such preeminence that is at stake when we consider the future of our space program.\u201d (Transcript) April 5-26:\tNASA\u2019s Pioneer 11 (Pioneer-G), second Jupiter probe, was successfully launched into an excellent trajectory from Eastern Test Range at 9:11 pm est by a three-stage Atlas-Centaur-TE.........M-364\u20144 launch vehjcle. Eighteen hundred persons watched the nighttime launch after touring the Kennedy Space Center Flight Training and Vehicle Assembly Buildings, where Skylab was being prepared for a mid-May launch. Pioneer 11 sped away from earth at a velocity of 51 800 km per hr (32 200 mph), equaling the speed of Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972, and still heading toward Jupiter), which flew faster than any previous man-made object. The primary objective was to obtain precursory scientific information beyond the Mars orbit with emphasis on investigation of the interplanetary medium during the 609- to 825-day journey, the Asteroid Belt, and Jupiter and its environment. The secondary objective was to advance the technology for long-duration flights to the outer planets. The 259-kg (570-lb) spin-stabilized spacecraft carried 12 scientific experiments to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and charged particles; the electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared ranges; and the asteroid-meteoroid population. During the encounter trajectory with Jupiter, the spacecraft would provide the best possible information on the radiation environment, provide good viewing conditions of Jupiter before periapses, and obtain a short occultation of the spacecraft by Jupiter. The spacecraft also carried a pictorial plaque identical to the one carried on Pioneer 10 for identification of its origin by any possible intelligent beings of another solar system. Six hours following launch the large number of thruster pulses used to precess the spacecraft and point the antenna toward the sun provided the impulse to deploy fully one of the two radioisotope thermoelectric generators that had failed to deploy completely at first. The magnetometer boom was deployed and the spin rate stabilized at 5.4 rpm. On April 6 four science instruments\u2014the helium vector magnetometer, charged particles experiment, geiger tube telescope, and meteoroid, detector\u2014were turned on. An April 11 midcourse correction moved the target point at Jupiter from slightly ahead of the planet as it moved on its orbit, and above the equatorial plane, to slightly behind the planet and below the equator. The adjusted course would allow several mission choices: to make an equatorial pass either close to or distant from the planet to inspect one or more of its moons; to pass over the flattened pole of the planet; to fly on to Saturn in 1980; or, like Pioneer 10, to leave the solar system and escape into interstellar space. The option chosen would depend on Pioneer 10 findings during its pass of Jupiter in December. Nine of the twelve experiments were turned on and were operating normally.\t. The control center for Pioneer 11 was transferred April 16 from Jet Propulsion Laboratory to the Pioneer Missions Operations Center at Ames Research Center. On April 26 Pioneer 11, traveling at 9.34 km per sec (20 900 mph), was 14 350 000 km (8 920 000 mi) from the earth. A second midcourse correction was made. The operation of all spacecraft subsystems was normal and 11 of the 12 experiments were transmitting good data. Six to seven hits had been recorded by the meteoroid detector. The infrared radiometer remained to be turned on. The spacecraft was expected to enter the Asteroid Belt in August 1973 and reach Jupiter in December 1974. The Pioneer program, begun in 1958, was directed by Ames Research Center. Pioneer 6 and 7 (launched Dec. 16, 1965, and Aug. 17, 1966, to study the heliocentric space environment) and Pioneer 8 and 9 (launched Dec. 13, 1967, and Nov. 8, 1968, to study interplanetary phenomena) continued to supply data from heliocentric orbit on solar plasma, magnetic and electric fields, and cosmic rays.

This has been most obvious in space in the geological exploration of the Moon, for example, in the rapid and comprehensive collection of samples, photographs, and observational data in the valley of Taurus-Littrow last December. This capacity will also be clear in certain aspects of Earth and solar observation where short-term dynamic processes are involved and in many space laboratory situations where rapid adjustments to changing experimental conditions are necessary. The dynamic range of the human eye and the mind\u2019s capability for rapid visual integration of changing geometry, color, and lighting make up an extremely versatile sensor system. In addition, when combined with experience and training of the man, this system allows for the efficient selection of other sensors pertinent to the problem at hand. By such selection man can intelligently reduce the quantity of data which analytical systems on the ground will be required to sort and treat in detail. This capability for on-the-spot data selection is not a trivial aspect of man\u2019s presence at the data collection point.

The spacecraft system provided 12 channels of communications to relay 10 color TV channels or up to 9600 telephone circuits. Two channels would be protection channels for the 10 traffic-carrying channels. The spacecraft was 1.8 m in diameter and 3.4 m high (6 by 11 ft). At launch it weighed 540 kg (1200 lbs) and its orbiting weight was 270 kg (600 lbs). The electronics system was powered by 23 000 solar cells with sufficient onboard battery capacity to maintain service during a sun eclipse of the solar cells. Anik 1 had been launched Nov. 9, 1972. The two-satellite system would act as space repeaters to receive transmissions from earth stations and retransmitt them to earth stations in Canada. A third satellite was retained on the ground as protection against space failure of the first two spacecraft and could be launched in 1975 to expand the system if required. NASA would be reimbursed by Telesat Canada for costs of the Thor-Delta launch vehicle and services.

Their assessment was that Salyut 2 had begun tumbling in orbit when a maneuvering engine fired and then kept firing out of control. The firing had forced Salyut 2 into cartwheel motion through space. Its solar panels had been torn loose, cutting the station off from almost all its electric power. The only electricity supplied to Salyut 2 after the accident had come from batteries that might now be burned out. A few U.S. observers thought the Soviet tracking ship that instructed the station to make the fatal maneuver had received details of the accident by radio from Salyut 2 before communications ceased. The ship had left its station off Newfoundland and had joined a sister ship in Curasao, Dutch West Indies, where both had been refueled and refitted. The ships were now in Cuba, which had led some space observers to think they might put to sea again to await a further Soviet attempt to launch a Salyut station. (W Post, 5/2/73, A20)",

Arriving at Mars, the spacecraft would enter a highly elliptical orbit and then separate into two parts, an orbiter and a lander. Each lander would carry a miniature chemical laboratory to analyze Martian soil for signs of life. A 3-m (10-ft) retractable claw would scoop soil samples for analysis. Other instruments would analyze the atmosphere and measure pressure, temperature, wind velocity, and quake activity. The orbiter would perform visual, thermal, and water-vapor mapping.

Kapryan said that if the arrays did not deploy \u201cthe mission will be seriously degraded.\u201d The crew was not set up to perform a fix-it-yourself extravehicular activity (eva) and there were no controls for deployment inside the Workshop. Anxious officials and flight controllers began analyzing radioed launch data. Analysis and later inspection revealed that the meteoroid shield had been torn off by vibration of the vehicle just after passing through mach 1 speed, near the time of highest dynamic pressure. Some early measurements indicated that the shield separation straps were still satisfactory, but later measurements indicated failure. The failure had released the securing mechanism on SAS Wing 2 and the wing ripped off. A piece of shield had wrapped around SAS Wing 1 and kept it from deploying. Loss of the wings, which were to provide power to the Workshop, reduced power to 50% of its average 8000-w output; the remaining 50% would he supplied by the four atm solar panels. At 11:00 pm edt Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider announced the Skylab 2 launch had been rescheduled to May 20 to allow assessment of damage and development of a new flight plan to maximize scientific return from Skylab\u2019s experiments with limited power. Fuel cells of the Skylab 2 command and service module (csm) would be used to produce electricity, after joining the Workshop, but the CSM oxygen and hydrogen for the cells would last only 16 to 21 days. It was too early to assess the effect on Skylab 3 and 4 missions, planned for 56 days each. On May 15 Skylab faced a new threat as temperatures inside the Workshop reached above 311 K (100°F). The lost meteoroid shield had also been designed to reflect sunlight and help cool the Workshop. \u201cWe think we can live with the electrical power shortage,\u201d Schneider said, \u201cbut if we can\u2019t solve this thermal problem we have a serious situation,\u201d Schneider feared foods and film might be spoiled, plastic parts might begin to leak poisonous gases, and the laboratory might become uninhabitable. The entire Skylab team was mobilized\u2014at Johnson Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Martin Marietta Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp., trw Inc., and Garrett AiResearch Co.\u2014in an all-out attempt to overcome the loss of the shield and solar arrays. Schneider said NASA was studying the possibility of the Skylab 2 astronauts\u2019 putting \u201csome kind of a thermal blanket around the spacecraft,\u201d but that would require a delay of the Skylab 2 launch beyond May 20. Astronauts would also inspect the solar wings, but whether they could make repairs was uncertain. The Skylab 2 crew returned to JSC May 15 to help flight planners salvage the mission. Special attitude maneuvers were run to obtain temperature data on the Skylab cluster and to limit Workshop temperatures, as internal temperature soared as high as 325 K (125°F). Temperature was reduced by pitching the Workshop with the longitudinal axis pointed at the sun for one orbit and, on May 16, the Workshop was tilted 55° away from the sun, with sufficient sunlight on the working solar panels to charge the batteries but moving the space station out of the sun\u2019s full glare. Teams continued to compute options to overcome the loss of the shield: astronauts could spray-paint Skylab Vs side to alter radiation properties of the gold foil coating the Workshop shell, could wallpaper the critical area, or could deploy a solar sunshade. Choice of the third option was announced May 16. The astronauts were trained in three possible methods of deploying the sunshade and in procedures to deploy the jammed solar panel. If they failed with the panel, a near-normal 16- to 21-day mission could still be realized by using the CSM power and curtailing some experiments. After that experiments would have to be severely cut back to reserve power for the CSm\u2019s trip home. On May 17 NASA announced postponement of the Skylab 2 launch until May 25 to allow the astronauts to practice techniques for deploying the sunshade and mission engineers to design, fabricate, and test hardware. Astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and Weitz flew to msfc to practice installing the sun shield in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator. On May 20 the Workshop was purged of any gases from the overheated insulation material and turned slightly to allow the sun to warm the airlock module and prevent water stored there from freezing and causing breakage. Components of the astronauts\u2019 repair kit were shipped to MSFC for final testing before being installed in Skylab 2\u2019s Apollo csm. On May 22 the Skylab 2 astronaut crew flew to KSC to prepare for the May 25 launch. Three thermal shields were decided on at a May 23 review: a parasol deployable from the Workshop through the solar scientific airlock, a backup twin-pole shield deployable by the crew during EVA, and a standup-EVA (seva) sail deployable by the crew from the CSM if both other methods failed. The Skylab 2 countdown resumed at 5:30 am edt May 23 at ksc. It had been halted eight hours after Skylab 1 liftoff May 14. On May 24 the three emergency sunshades and necessary tools were stored in the CM. Significant experiments\u2014S015, effects of zero g on single human cells; S020, x-ray/solar photography; T025, coronagraph contamination measurements; M555, gallium arsenide crystal growth; equipment for S063, ultraviolet (uv) airglow horizon photography; and spare equipment for TV coverage of the ATM EVA\u2014were removed to accommodate the additional 180 kg (400 lbs) of equipment. The crew would also carry an extra medical kit to replace medicines spoiled by high temperatures in Skylab 1. Lightning struck the Skylab 2 mobile service structure at 5:24 pm EDT May 24, but retests of the vehicle indicated no damage. At a May 24 press conference Program Director Schneider said there would be limited activity by the crew to deploy the partially opened solar panel. \u201cWe\u2019re not too optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to do too much, although we will give Capt. Conrad the option to try it if it looks like a reasonable job.\u201d NASA was \u201cvery confident that ... we will be able to deploy a [thermal] shield, we will get the spacecraft temperatures back under control, and we will have a good 28-day mission.\u201d May 25:\tSkylab 2 (SL-2) was launched from ICSC Launch Complex 39, Pad B, on a two-stage Saturn IB launch vehicle into heavy dark clouds on time at 9:00 am edt. As Astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and Weitz headed toward the Skylab 1 Workshop they were to attempt to repair in orbit and man for 28 days, Commander Conrad told Mission Control, \u201cWe fix anything.\u201d The csm/S-IVB combination was placed in a phasing orbit with 224-km (139.2-mi) apogee and 150-km (93.2-mi) perigee 9 min 56 sec after launch. Six minutes later the csm separated. The S\u2014IVB stage deorbit maneuver was performed at 2:23 pm edt and the stage splashed into the Pacific Ocean. The CSM rendezvoused with the Workshop at 4:30 pm EDT over the Guam tracking station on the fifth orbit. During 15 min of TV coverage the CSM flew around the Workshop, within 1.5 m (5 ft) of it. The astronauts confirmed that the SAS Wing 2 was missing and that the SAS Wing 1, deployed only 15°, was restrained by a piece of the micrometeoroid shield wrapped around the SAS beam fairing. Portions of the gold foil laminated to the Workshop skin for thermal protection had been torn and heat and uv radiation from the sun had scorched the skin. The astronauts soft-docked the CSM with the Workshop, using only three capture latches; ate dinner; and undocked to attempt to deploy the jammed solar panel. Weitz stood in the open hatch of the CSM with Kerwin holding his knees to keep him from drifting into space. He tried to free the solar panel with a shepherd\u2019s crook and a pole with pruning shears attached without success. Conrad told Mission Control that the panel appeared to be \u201chooked in there like it\u2019s nailed on.\u201d The repair attempt was ended at 8:12 pm edt. The crew made four unsuccessful attempts to redock with the Workshop. Working in bulky spacesuits and gloves, the astronauts evacuated the air from the Apollo cabin and hooked up an electric cable to override a suspected short in the docking probe. \u201cYea. We got a hard dock out of it [a docking using all 12 sealing latches to seal the two spacecraft together],\u201d Conrad said at 11:50 pm edt. The crew found one of the capture latches had stuck in the retracted position, but troubleshooting procedures recommended by Mission Control restored the latch. May 26-June 21:\tThe Skylab 2 crew entered the multiple docking adapter on the Skylab Workshop at 12:45 pm edt May 26 and performed activation and Workshop preentry tasks. A chemical detection device inserted into the passage indicated no lethal gas was present. At 2:30 pm edt Astronaut Weitz entered the Workshop wearing a gas mask, gloves, and soft shoes to protect him from the heat. Weitz told ground control, \u201cThe ows appears to be in good shape. It feels a little bit warm as you might expect, like 90 to 100 degrees [F; 305 to 310 K] in the desert. I felt heat radiating from everywhere but I never felt uncomfortable. And nothing I touched felt hot to me. It\u2019s a dry heat.\u201d Kerwin and Conrad followed Weitz. After a quick inspection, the crew closed the hatch. At 4:30 pm edt the crew began to deploy the solar parasol\u2014a mylar shade folded against a telescopic pole\u2014through the solar airlock. As they readied the parasol, the astronauts looked out of the windows and identified landmarks across the U.S. Weitz recognized Seattle, Wash., and Conrad spotted both launch pads used for the Skylab launches at Conrad and Weitz popped open the shiny aluminum and orange canopy at 8:30 pm edt May 26 (Mission Day 2) while Kerwin took TV photos from the attached Apollo cm. Significant external temperature decreases were noted almost immediately after deployment. Internal temperatures decreased more slowly. The Workshop was headed back to solar inertial attitude. By May 27 the Workshop temperature had dropped to 309 K (97°F). The crew activated systems and experiments while their back-and-forth excursions through the Workshop were televised to the earth. The Washington Post later said they resembled \u201cskin divers snorkeling through a cave in the Caribbean\u201d or a scene from the film \u201c2001\u201d with astronauts \u201cin orange flight suits and white T-shirts swimming like fish through the big workshop, floating backwards and tumbling like gymnasts.\u201d On May 28 the astronauts began the first medical tests, taking and processing blood samples and checking the conditions of their circulatory and metabolic systems. Checkout and preparation of the (atm) was begun. During a seven-minute televised space-to-ground news conference beginning at 1:09 pm edt, Conrad said the crew had adapted rapidly. \u201cNone of us has had any motion sickness. ... It seems to be like the simulator except with the absence of gravity.\u201d Kerwin concluded that the brain and eyes must override the body\u2019s vestibule system in the inner ear. \u201cYou say to your brain, \u2018Brain, I want that way to be up.\u2019 And your brain says, \u2018OK, then that way is up.\u2019 . . . Your brain will follow you.\u201d Conrad agreed, \u201cWe\u2019re in good shape for 28 days.\u201d Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, jsc Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, said later in the mission that it was \u201crather amazing\u201d that the crew had shown no signs of the expected motion sickness. Data received were preliminary, but prelaunch exercises in a whirling chair might have helped avoid nausea. Temperatures continued to drop slowly, reaching 304 K (88°F). At 8:50 pm edt a 69-sec trim burn put the Workshop into a repeating ground track about 96 km (60 mi) west of normal, to acquire earth resources data. On May 29 checkout of the ATM was completed and four passes were made. Kerwin trained an array of telescopes to observe x-ray emissions and examine the structure of the sun\u2019s atmosphere. He photographed three regions of the sun considered active by solar physicists and made detailed observations of the full solar disk and the corona. Conrad and Weitz prepared the earth-oriented cameras for earth resources experiment package (erep) passes. Two biomedical runs were made. During a private conversation with jsc, Conrad reported that the internal temperature had stabilized near 304 K (88°F) and that, while this would be tolerable for the rest of the mission, he did not think the crew could carry out the full protocol on the bicycle ergometer (exercise device). On May 30 the solar telescopes were aimed at the active regions of the sun while scientists on the earth received excellent TV photos of the solar corona and the solar disk in the uv spectrum. The first erep photo pass was made over a 3200-km (2000-mi) strip from Oregon to the Gulf of Mexico. Good pictures were obtained of the Great Salt Lake, gypsum beds in New Mexico, and the soil salinity of the Rio Grande Valley, as well as microwave measurements of the Gulf of Mexico. After the erep pass, the batteries\u2014at a reduced level of 45% to 50% capacity\u2014tripped off line and ceased to produce electricity. They had been designed to trip off at 20% capacity. One battery also lost the regulator that allowed the solar panel to recharge it, decreasing the total Workshop power by 6%, or 250 w, leaving 4200 w. The Workshop required 3600 w for maintenance, leaving only 600 w for experiments. The second erep pass was canceled for a power evaluation. Sixteen batteries were brought back on line but two remained off line and were useless. Heat, fans, and lights were powered down. Workshop power continued reduced May 31 and erep experiments were canceled. The crew continued medical experiments, each taking a turn in a rotating chair to provide data on motion sickness and maintaining balance in zero g. Weitz repaired the mirror system on the uv stellar photography experiment. Temperatures had dropped to 301 K (82°F). The Skylab astronauts took their first day off June 1 (Mission Day 8) and their first shower in space. On a 15-min color telecast they performed housekeeping chores and\u2014to the music from the film \u201c2001\u201d\u2014 did handstands, somersaults, and cartwheels in the zero-g atmosphere. Conrad led the crew in a run around the watertanks. Centrifugal force overcame weightlessness, so the men could keep their feet on the track. On the ground Skylab officials announced the decision to make a second attempt to free the jammed solar panel, while engineers and the backup astronauts, led by Russell L. Schweickart, tested EVA procedures. On June 2, Conrad and Weitz made a 10-min erep photo pass from California to Central Mexico to gather data on earthquakes, volcanoes, pollution sources, mineral resources, and land-use patterns. On the ground Schweickart successfully tested three ways of freeing the jammed solar panel using a bolt cutter, a prying rod, and a surgeon\u2019s bone saw. The astronauts completed the third erep pass over North America and the fifth ATM pass on June 3. The nuclear emulsion experiment, the transuranic cosmic ray detector, and the neutron analysis detector were deployed. Astronaut Conrad set a new world record for time in space at 1:17 am EDT, surpassing the 715-hr 5-min mark set by Astronaut James A. Lovell, Jr. The first ball game in space was held in the Workshop. Conrad said a ball thrown in weightlessness \u201cgoes straight as an arrow.\u201d The fourth erep pass was made June 4, as well as five hours of atm solar viewing. Dr. John Zeiglschmid, Skylab Flight Surgeon, told a JSC press briefing that the physical condition of the Skylab crew was excellent. They were consuming the proper amount of food and getting adequate rest. Conrad and Kerwin had lost only 0.5 kg (1 lb) ; Weitz had lost 1.8 kg (4 lbs). Top Skylab officials at msfc agreed that solar wing deployment techniques developed by Astronaut Schweickart were feasible, without unusual safety hazards. On June 6 preparations were made for the next day\u2019s EVA. Conrad said, \u201cI guess we have a fifty-fifty chance of pulling it off.\u201d The 16 Workshop batteries were producing 4200 w\u2014only 600 w more than the minimum necessary for the astronauts\u2019 survival. One battery was down to half charge and others were believed to have been damaged by the heat. The astronauts photographed hurricane Ava during an erep pass, made an atm pass, and photographed uv spectra of stars. Conrad and Kerwin opened the am eva hatch at 11:23 am edt June 7 and extended their umbilicals and a rigged-up 7.6-m (25-ft) pole fitted with cutters for releasing the jammed solar wing, as Weitz took TV photos from the Skylab and the csm. Outsid Kerwin had difficulty keeping a firm footing, with only makeshift andholds and foot restraints, as he secured the end of the pole to antenna mount. His heart rate rose to 150 beats per minute and he \\s burning energy at 2000 to 2500 BTUs an hour. Finally he extended the pole to the beam holding the wing and\u2014with Conrad repeatedly telling him to \u201ctake it easy\u201d and \u201ccool it\u201d\u2014managed after several tries to fit the cutters around the small bolt that restrained the wing. Conrad moved hand over hand along the pole to the wing. Tangling of the 10.6- and 18.3-m (35- and 60-ft) flexible umbilicals linking the astronauts to spacecraft life support systems complicated their movements. Kerwin pulled a lanyard to snap the cutters and sever the bolt and then extended the wing using a rope attached to the upper surface. Conrad pulled a rope to break a frozen actuator. Two of the sections making up the wing were 40% deployed and the other about 30%. The two astronauts also changed a film magazine in a telescope camera and latched open a balky door on an x-ray telescope before reentering the Workshop and closing the am eva hatch at 2:53 pm edt, concluding 3 hrs 30 min successful eva. The Workshop was pitched up to expose the panels to more direct sunlight and unfreeze the hydraulic system that deployed them. After a few hours one section was 90% deployed, another 40%, and the third 29%. By the next day the sections were fully deployed. Additional electric power of 3000 w was obtained and all eight batteries supplied by the solar panels were charged and in good working order\u2014paving the way for a full Skylab mission. From Mission Control Schweickart said, \u201cEverybody\u2019s shaking hands down here and we just wish we could reach up and shake yours.\u201d President Nixon sent a message: \u201cOn behalf of the American people I congratulate and commend you and your crew on your successful effort to repair the world\u2019s first true space station. In the two weeks since you left earth, you have more than fulfilled the prophecy of your parting words, \u2018We can fix anything.\u2019 All of us now have new courage that man can work in space to control his environment, improve his circumstances and exert his will even as he does on earth.\u201d On June 12 the ninth erep pass was made. Weitz said he could see pollution flowing into Lake Erie and he couldn\u2019t find Washington, D.C., because of haze. Conrad melted an aluminum alloy to study the behavior of molten metal in weightlessness and used an electron beam for welding inside a small vacuum chamber. On June 13 Dr. Hawkins told a JSC medical review that Kerwin and Weitz were no longer able to perform at preflight levels on the bicycle ergometer, indicating their cardiovascular systems had been weakened by weightlessness. The condition was not at dangerous levels and was not interfering with their normal day-to-day performance. Weitz photographed a massive explosion on the sun with the atm solar telescopes June 15. The flare had erupted from the center of the sun\u2019s side facing the earth and covered an area 40 200 km (25 000 mi) wide. Conrad checked out the Apollo CSM for the return trip to earth, while Kerwin initiated the growth of bacteria in a culture medium and photographed its behavior in the space environment. On June 17 a trim burn corrected a cross-track error and positioned the vehicle for the start of the Skylab 3 mission. President Nixon telephoned the astronauts from Key Biscayne, Fla.: \u201cI guess the way I could summarize this project is that it proves that man still matters. With all the technical machines . . . that you had to work with, it proved that when there were difficulties the ingenuity of men in space was what really mattered, and you have made us all very proud with the way you handled some difficult problems in this project.\u201d The President invited the three Skylab astronauts to visit him at San Clemente, Calif., after splashdown. At 3:22 am edt June 18 (MD\u201425) astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and Weitz surpassed the previous space endurance record held by the Soyuz 11 cosmonauts (launched June 6, 1971). Conrad asked that a message be relayed to Soviet cosmonauts giving \u201cour respects at this point in our flight to them and their comrades. Wish them good luck from us in the future.\u201d EVA-2 began at 6:53 am edt June 19. Conrad and Weitz moved through space to retrieve and replace the atm film cassettes while Kerwin photographed the eva for TV from inside the Workshop. Conrad also freed a stuck relay by striking it with a hammer. One of two dead batteries began charging immediately. From the ground Schweickart said, \u201cIt worked. Thank you very much, gentlemen. You\u2019ve done it again.\u201d The cameras for the white light coronagraph and x-ray spectroheliographic experiments were replaced by the astronauts to permit photography during the unmanned period between Skylab 2 and 3. eva operations ended at 8:29 am edt, after 1 hr 36 min. During a June 20 press conference from space Kerwin said the astronauts\u2019 physical condition was \u201ca pleasant big surprise. I\u2019m tremendously encouraged about the future of long-duration flight.\u201d June 22:\tThe astronauts undocked the csm from the Skylab Workshop at 4:55 am edt on Mission Day 29. As the csm pulled away and circled the Workshop, TV and photographic coverage were obtained by the crew, cm separation from the sm at 5:40 am edt was followed by initial service propulsion system firing at 6:05 am edt and a final deorbit maneuver at 9:11 am edt. The cm splashed down at 9:50 am edt 1340 km (830 mi) southwest of San Diego. A recovery helicopter dropped swimmers who installed a flotation collar and a sea anchor. The recovery ship Ticonderoga was maneuvered beside the CM and a crane lifted it aboard with the astronauts inside. Medical examinations on board the recovery ship found some dizziness and ill effects from weightlessness. The crew would travel by ship to San Diego and by air to Ellington Air Force Base, Tex., June 24. The Skylab 1-2 mission achieved its primary objectives of establishing the Skylab Orbital Assembly in earth orbit, obtaining medical data on the crew for use in extending the duration of manned space flight, and performing inflight experiments. It contributed significantly toward program objectives of determining man\u2019s ability to live and work in space for extended periods, extending the science of solar astronomy beyond the limits of earth-based observations, and developing improved techniques for surveying earth resources from space. Despite mission anomalies, 80% of the solar data planned was obtained; 12 of the 15 earth resources data runs were accomplished; all 16 medical experiments were conducted as required and a time history of man\u2019s adaptations to zero-g environment was obtained for the first time; and data were taken on all 43 experiments scheduled for Skylab 2 except those precluded by the use of the solar parasol and weight and power limitations. The performance of the flight crew was good and the mission was judged officially on July 14 to be a success. Major records set to date included the longest-duration manned flight, 28 days 50 min; the longest total time in space for one man, 49 days for Conrad (veteran of Gemini 5 and 11 and Apollo 12 missions) ; the longest inflight EVA, 3 hrs 30 min by Conrad and Kerwin June 7; and the longest distance in orbit for a manned flight, 18 531 559 km (11514 967 mi). Skylab 1-2 was the first U.S. manned orbital workshop. Skylab 3 was scheduled to be launched in August and Skylab 4 in November. The Workshop would be operated unmanned between manned missions. The Skylab program was directed by NASA\u2019s Office of Manned Space Flight, msfc developed and integrated the major program components including the ows, AM, MDA, atm, payload shroud, and most experiments and was responsible for the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles. KSc managed launch operations. JSC was responsible for flight operations, recovery, crew selection and training, and development of the modified CSM and the spacecraft launch adapter. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under the overall direction of the Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition.

      "story": " Man\u2019s ability to survive in space was discussed in New York Times and Washington Post articles. Of 33 astronauts who had made Apollo flights, 11 had suffered from motion sickness for the first few days in space. Apollo 13 (April 11\u201417, 1970), the aborted moon landing mission, had indicated that men in danger would have a tough time surviving in space. Astronaut James A. Lovell, Jr., had lost 6 kg (14 lbs) during the six-day mission. John L. Swigert, Jr., had been so overcome by fatigue near the end of the flight that he made several errors in checking reentry procedures. Fatigue might also have contributed to the deaths of the Soviet Soyuz 11 (June 6-30, 1971) cosmonauts. Calcium loss in weightlessness, the most serious of potential medical problems, could lead to thinning of the bones and subsequent bone breaks after long periods in space. Other health problems included increased heart rates, weight loss, decreased oxygen consumption, reduced blood pressure, and the reduced flow of blood to the brain and kidneys. Psychological effects, as well as these problems, would be studied on Skylab missions. Were windows necessary? Should doors be doorshaped or would circular holes be sufficient? Would the crew tolerate sleeping upright in sleeping bags attached to the walls? (Schmeck, NYT, 5/14/73, 24; O\u2019Toole, W Post, 5/14/73, A12)",

NASA had made a preliminary inventory of its test facilities applicable to nsf\u2019s solar energy research program. nsf had requested NASA to review the status of solar insolation data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and, working with noaa, to examine the need for better data and methods. Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Cal Tech Environmental Quality Laboratory were jointly conducting workshops and studies in water heating and other solar technology applications. A NASA Wind Energy Workshop at LeRC would pursue plans for a wind energy research program. Other areas of NASA participation included research into bio-conversion of organic materials to fuels, thermal batteries and superconducting transmission technology, earthquake engineering, regional environmental systems, trace contaminants, and fire.

We don\u2019t know which. The full impact of this malfunction was not known until several hours after launch; we still do not know the specifics of the actual damage. The net result was that Skylab was in a good orbit, but had only approximately one-half of its power-generating capability in operation and also was overheating badly.\u201d The overheating occurred because the damaged micrometeoroid shield was also to have provided thermal balance. It was painted \u201cto reflect the proper amount of sunlight so that the laboratory would stay cool.\u201d The Skylab 2 astronauts hoped to repair the damage and then carry out a 28-day mission. \u201cIf the planned repairs are successful, we will also be able to accomplish most of the activities scheduled for the two subsequent missions, each lasting 56 days.\u201d Skylab 2 would carry several sunshades. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the micrometeoroid shield is completely severed or whether parts of it are obstructing some of the areas where the sunshade might he fixed, but ... by carrying several different shades, we should at least have one which will be suitable.\u201d Dr. Fletcher described steps to be taken to deploy the solar panels. \u201cIf it looks like an easy thing to do, if one of the panels ... is partially deployed and is hung up on something and all it needs is a little tug, we will put a loop of twine around the end of it, play it out so that we are well away from the panel in case it starts to deploy, and give a little tug on the twine. If it deploys, fine; but if it does not, we will go on without it. But we are not going to spend too much time on that fix. There are too many uncertainties and we do not really need the power.\u201d (Transcript)",

Above all, we need the humility to admit that we will not find any absolute answers or permanent solutions.\u201d But the fallacy of the approaching doomsday argument was \u201cthat it ignores the considerable evidence we already have that man can in fact modify his behavior fast enough to avoid the catastrophic disasters predicted by the doomsday-sayers.\u201d The evidence included the fact that scarcely a decade after Rachel Carson\u2019s warning against pesticides (in her book Silent Spring) \u201cthose chemicals are severely controlled\u2014possibly too much so\u2014and biodegradable equivalents are on the verge of being introduced.\u201d Lake Michigan\u2019s marine life was nearing extinction 10 yrs ago; \u201cby vigorous ecological controls it has been restored.\u201d Development and control of the rapidly changing synthetic environment had become as important as contending with nature.

The second of two approved RAE missions and the last scheduled U.S. mission to the moon, Explorer 49 was to measure galactic and solar radio noise at frequencies below ionospheric cutoffs and outside terrestrial background interference, using the moon for occul-tation, focusing, or aperture-blocking for increased resolution and discrimination. At 17 min after launch, the spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle\u2019s 3rd stage. One midcourse correction was made at 11:28 am edt June 11; the planned second correction was not required. During the transfer trajectory, data acquisition from telemetry systems was excellent. The lunar orbit insertion motor was fired at 3:21 am edt June 15, putting the spacecraft into lunar orbit with 1334-km (828.9-mi) apolune, 1123-km (697.8-mi) perilune, 241-min period, and 61.3° inclination. On June 18 the lunar insertion motor was jettisoned and the hydrazine-fueled velocity-control propulsion system placed Explorer 49 in a lower, near-circular orbit with a 1063-km (660.5-mi) apolune, 1052-km (653.7mi) perilune, 221.2-min period, and 38.7° inclination. On June 20 a 37-m (l20-ft) dipole antenna was extended by ground control and the, dipole experiment turned on. After a two-week calibration, the dipole would be retracted and the orbit adjusted as needed. The two main V antennas, joined in an X shape, would then be deployed to 183 m (600 ft). After another week, the V antennas would be deployed to their full 229-m (750-ft) length to achieve the mission\u2019s gravity-gradient, three-axis-stabilization mode. The 200-kg (442-lb) spacecraft was the first known to use boron filament for the inertial booms that helped stabilize it during the lunar trajectory. Explorer 38 (RAE 1)\u2014the first successful radio astronomy satellite, launched July 4, 1968\u2014had measured galactic radio sources and traced the movement of sporadic radio outbursts from the sun beyond the orbit of Mercury for four years.

Fletcher, NASA Administrator. The Board, chaired by Lewis Research Center Director Bruce T. Lundin, said the most probable cause was inadequate venting of the pressure in a tunnel beneath the shield. Differential pressure buildup in the tunnel had forced the shield away from the Workshop shell and into the supersonic air stream. The shield then broke the tiedowns holding the solar array wings onto the spacecraft. About 10 min into the flight one solar array wing was torn away completely when it was struck by the exhaust plume of the 2nd-stage retrorockets. The remaining solar array wing would not deploy until the astronauts cut the strap which had curled around the wing and penetrated the metal fairing housing the array. The Board had found that \u201cthe significance of the aerodynamic loads on the meteoroid shield during launch was not revealed by the extensive review process\u201d and recommended that complex, multidisciplinary systems like the shield \u201cshould have a designated project engineer who is responsible for all aspects of analysis, design, fabrication, test and assembly.\u201d There was no evidence that the shield\u2019s design deficiencies had resulted from or been masked by the Skylab management system. \u201cOn the contrary, the rigor, detail, and thoroughness of the system are doubtless necessary for a program of this magnitude.\u201d (nasa Release 73-135; Lundin testimony before Sen Com on Aero and Space Sci, 7/30/73) July 14:\tSweden had handed the 25-nation Geneva disarmament conference a list of 925 nuclear weapon tests carried out from World War II through April 25, 425 of them after the August 1963 signing of the treaty banning all experimental nuclear blasts above ground, Reuters reported.

United Press International reported Western sources as saying the apparent aim of Mars 4 was to softland research instruments and TV cameras on the Martian surface. Mars 4 would be the fourth Soviet spacecraft to reach Mars. Mars 1 (launched Nov. 1, 1962, to fly by Mars) had transmitted data to the earth for more than four months during its journey, before communications went dead. Mars 2 had been put into orbit around the planet and transmitted data to the earth into August 1972. An instrumented capsule from the spacecraft crashlanded on the Martian surface Nov. 27, 1971, becoming the first man-made object to reach the surface. Mars 3 had also attempted to softland an instrumented capsule, during a dust storm. TV pictures were transmitted to the earth for 20 sec before transmission ceased abruptly.

At an Apollo Telescope Mount briefing Dr. Robert A. MacQueen, a Skylab principal investigator and High Altitude Observatory scientist, said that a first look at available data indicated that the objectives\u2014■ to examine the solar corona on a regular basis, deduce the threedimensional structure and geometry of the corona, understand the evolution of the corona and its relationship to the solar disk, and understand the outflow of the solar wind from the corona\u2014would be met. The most important conclusion drawn was that \u201cin appearance the corona is now a less dynamic subject than other solar phenomena.\u201d Dr. Edward M. Reeves, Harvard College Observatory scientist, said that an ATM scanner had observed \u201cvelocity changes in whole large areas of the Sun in lines of the transition region and the corona which have never before been seen in this part of the spectrum.\u201d At the medical science briefing, Dr. Michael W. Whittle, Principal Coordinating Scientist, said that the weight losses of the three Skylab 2 astronauts\u20141.8 kg (4 lbs) for Charles Conrad, Jr., 2.7 kg (6 lbs) for Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, and 3.6 kg (8 lbs) for Paul J. Weitz\u2014were \u201cpure and simple adaptation to weightlessness. . . . Increased nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus, the major constituents of muscle tissue, had appeared in the urine and indicated the muscle loss. Dr. Stephen L. Kimsey, a Skylab principal investigator, said that experiments had shown \u201cno abnormal changes in red cell metabolism\u201d in amount of energy stored, change in the integrity of the cell membrane, or change in the red cells\u2019 ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the tissue. Dr. Verl R. Wilmarth, earth resources experiment package project scientist, said during an erep briefing that the objective of mapping the depression of the sea surface of the Puerto Rican trench using altimeter data had been met. At a briefing on the corollary experiments Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, Associate Director for Science at Marshall Space Flight Center, said that the materials processing and welding experiments would help verify methods of construction and assembly in weightless conditions. Among the first things built in space might be a reflector for microwavq energy, to transmit large amounts of energy from one point of the earth to another.

A series of problems threatened to disrupt the mission, but corrective actions and workarounds permitted it to proceed successfully, setting new manned flight records. The astronauts collected significant data in medical experiments, solar astronomy, and earth resources surveys for 59 days before undocking for a safe return to earth Sept. 25.

At 5 hrs 19 min 53 sec after launch the S\u2014IVB/iu deorbit maneuver was commanded, and the stage impacted the predicted Pacific Ocean area after planned maneuvers. During CSM maneuvers to rendezvous with the Workshop, a leak was detected in the CSM reaction control system (rcs) quad B thruster, one of four assemblies of rockets used to stabilize the spacecraft or to change its velocity and also used as a backup for bringing the CSM back from orbit. Analysis indicated the oxidizer valve was stuck open or partially open. Quad B was isolated; analysis showed that all deorbit mission rules could be satisfied. The CSM rendezvoused with the Workshop at 3:38 pm edt on the fifth orbit. Rendezvous, fly-around, and docking were covered by 23 min of TV.

There\u2019s a desire to maybe take a break for an hour or two and get in the bunk and stay still for a while.\u201d Flight Director Neil B. Hutchinson told the press at JSC that extravehicular activity (eva) to install a new sun shield and retrieve and install Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) film probably would be delayed from July 31 to Aug. 1 at the earliest. Four to five hours of work were carried over from July 28 and 29. Still suffering from motion sickness, the astronauts continued Workshop activation July 30 (Mission Day 3). The first EVA was delayed to Aug. 2 and later rescheduled to Aug. 4 to ensure the astronauts\u2019 complete recovery. Activation was completed July 31 (MD-4) and research began as the crew improved slightly. Bean told ground control: \u201cWe\u2019re getting better; it\u2019s just taking a little longer than we thought. . . . Everybody feels pretty good between meals. Then mealtime comes, and we\u2019re caught ... in the squeeze. We\u2019re trying to decide whether we ought to eat all we have to ... to keep our strength up, or eat about what we want to, which isn\u2019t very much.\u201d A TV broadcast from the space station July 31 showed minnows for a biomedical experiment swimming in their plastic aquarium in tight spirals and sometimes apparently trying to swim toward the surface, but with their heads pointed straight down. Garriott said, \u201cApparently they can\u2019t make up their minds which way is up and down, either.\u201d He also turned a spider named Arabella loose in a plastic cage to observe her web-spinning abilities in zero-g conditions. Later in the mission Garriott reported baby minnows hatched in space performed in water \u201cas if they\u2019d already adapted while they were still in the egg.\u201d They \u201cfelt right accustomed to zero-g.\u201d August 1-September 24:\tBean told ground controllers after breakfast Aug. 1 (MD\u20145) : \u201cThis is the first morning we\u2019ve been up here . . . that after a meal everybody felt good. Everybody feels real good right now. Best since we\u2019ve been here.\u201d During live TV the astronauts ate a hearty lunch to music. Bean demonstrated his proficiency in eating while hanging upside down. A medical briefing below at Johnson Space Center suggested that moving quickly from the confined cm to the large Workshop might have contributed to the motion sickness. The milder nausea experienced on the May 25\u2014June 22 Skylab 2 mission could have been caused by a more gradual transition into the Workshop. \u201cI think that it is merely a matter of room in which you can exercise your vestibular mechanisms, and that the workshop simply presents more of that space. . . . perhaps it was too much too soon.\u201d On Aug. 2 a master alarm buzzer awakened the astronauts at 6:45 am EDT. Pressure and temperature were falling rapidly in the CSM reaction control system quad D because of an oxidizer leak. Because of quad B\u2019s July 28 leak, only A and C of the four quads remained fully operational. The quad D leak lasted two hours, losing an estimated 5 kg (12 lbs) of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. Apollo Flight Director Glynn S. Lunney said at a morning press briefing that the spacecraft was flyable with the loss of the two quads but \u201cit would be flown in a mode which is not entirely standard.\u201d The main concern was \u201cthat we have had two problems which are related, at least they seem to be related.\u201d A flaw common to the whole RCS could necessitate the crew\u2019s immediate return to the earth or accelerated preparation of the Skylab 4 spacecraft to make it available as a rescue vehicle should the CSM become unusable. Full activation of Skylab-rescue-vehicle preparation was authorized. Launch and checkout crews began working a 24-hr-day, 7-day-week schedule, preparing two additional couches and other equipment for installation. Earliest possible date for a rescue mission was established as Sept. 5. The EVA rescheduled for Aug. 4 was again postponed, for 24 to 48 hours to free the crew for system checks, to free ground controllers to troubleshoot the problem, and to give time to work out EVA procedures for the new spacecraft configuration. While reentry procedures were being rewritten for the new configuration, the astronauts continued scientific experiments. By the afternoon of Aug. 2 Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., jsc Director, was able to tell the astronauts that troubleshooting the RCS had indicated no apparent generic problem, but two unique quad failures, and there was now confidence that the two remaining quads would ensure attitude control should immediate reentry become necessary. \u201cWe\u2019re proceeding ... as if we\u2019re going to have a normal mission.\u201d Astronaut Bean replied: \u201cFine. You just said the right words. . . . we\u2019re pretty happy with the way things are going, at the moment . . . and we agree 100 percent with what you just announced. . . . everybody\u2019s happy up here.\u201d On Aug. 3 Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said at a JSC press briefing that continuing investigation indicated the two quad failures were unrelated and reexamination of reentry capabilities showed three ways of returning to the earth: using the primary service propulsion system, using the RCS with the two operational quads, and using the hybrid RCS in the cm. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling considerably better than . . . yesterday morning.\u201d A slowdown was ordered in the emergency rescue preparations. The Apollo cm would be outfitted in a Skylab 4 configuration, with three astronaut couches rather than the five needed for a rescue mission. The slowdown would delay rescue readiness until Sept. 10. Astronauts Bean, Garriott, and Lousma conducted their first full day of experiments and prepared for an earth resources experiment package pass. Garriott held the TV camera at the window to telecast a good view of the U.S. from North Dakota to North Carolina. Later the first of 26 erep passes was made, to gather data for oil exploration, ocean temperatures, mapping, land use surveys, crop inventories, and pollution studies. A master alarm sounded in the CSM Aug. 4, later attributed to a short-circuit in Skylab\u2019s solar telescope system. The short knocked out one of the two TV systems in the atm but did not afFect Skylab\u2019s main power system. Ground crews investigated problems in the primary and secondary coolant systems Aug. 5. One had been slowly leaking since the Skylab 1 launch May 14 and was expected to become inoperative in 16 to 20 days. The secondary loop was thought to have a small leak, begun during the Skylab 2 mission and giving the loop a predicted 60-day lifetime. Possibly additional coolant would have to be carried up by the next manned mission, Skylab 4, but Program Director Schneider said there was \u201cno immediate danger to the crew.\u201d By Aug. 6 evaluations showed that only the primary loop was leaking; the second was sound and could operate for the rest of Skylab 3 as well as for Skylab 4. Flight surgeon Paul Buchanan\u2019s nightly bulletin said Aug. 5 that the crew \u201ccontinues to report good health and optimistic outlook\u201d and had asked about an increase in their menus \u201cto match their growing appetites.\u201d Fluid intake and output was \u201coptimal.\u201d The first EVA was performed Aug. 6. Garriott and Lousma stepped outside the orbiting laboratory at 1:30 pm edt to install the 3.6- by 7.3-m (12- by 24-ft), paper-thin, aluminized Mylar awning over the Workshop to reflect the sun\u2019s rays away from the spacecraft skin, damaged when the meteoroid shield was torn ofF during the May launch. Garriott, standing in the Skylab\u2019s open hatch, pieced together the two 16.8-m (55-ft) poles from metal sections and handed them to Lousma. Lousma attached them to a bracket to form a \u201cV\u201d over the Workshop. The sunshade was slowly pulled up by a system of pulleys. One rope kept twisting around the poles and the sunshade folds did not straighten immediately, but after four hours\u2014twice the time expected\u2014the sunshade was successfully deployed. Workshop temperatures were lowered before the EVA ended. Astronaut Bean said Garriott and Lousma worked \u201cat a slow and steady pace\u201d and were not tired. Lousma retrieved and replaced film in four ATM experiments, installed two new cameras, removed a door latch from an atm experiment, and fixed the particle-collection experiment to the rim of the atm. Lousma also inspected the two leaking quads in the CSM RCS and looked for coolant leaks. He noted some evidence of micrometeorite pitting but no clues to causes of the malfunctions. The astronauts completed the eva at 8:01 pm edt, after 6 hrs 31 min, surpassing the 3-hr 30-min record set June 7 by Skylab 2 Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., and Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin. Garriott, first solar physicist in space, focused the atm cameras on the sun Aug. 7 for the first time during the mission. TV audiences watched him work at the ATM panel. By Aug. 8 Dr. Lawrence F. Dietlein, jsc Deputy Director for Life Sciences, reported the astronauts were \u201cin excellent spirits and have no health problems.\u201d They had completely recovered from motion sickness. Their weights had stabilized after a loss of 1.8 to 2.3 kg (4 to 5 lbs) each. Data obtained on the rotating chair indicated their sensitivity to motion had lifted. Since deployment of the sunshade, temperatures in the Workshop had dropped to 296 K (74°F). The crew photographed a coronal transient with the ATM camera two hours Aug. 10. It was the first time a transient\u2014protons and free electrons expelled violently from the sun\u2019s limb at a speed of about 312 km (194 mi) per sec, a phenomenon that occurred two or three times a year\u2014had been observed at that range and time resolution. Program Director Schneider announced Aug. 14 that Skylab 3 would continue its full 59-day mission. From analyses of the CSM and Workshop, he had \u201cconcluded that there is no imminent need for rescue, and ... we have made the decision to proceed with a normal test flow on an accelerated basis at Cape Kennedy.\u201d Skylab 4 was being prepared for a normal mission but would be available for a rescue mission if necessary. The earliest launch date could be Sept. 25. Schneider said, \u201cWe\u2019re reasonably confident that [csm] 117 is a good vehicle.\u201d \u201cLooks like they got a renewed burst of confidence down there,\u201d Bean said when told of the decision. \u201cWe feel that way up here.\u201d JSC announced Aug. 21 that the astronauts would install a new \u201csix-pack\u201d of gyroscopes during an Aug. 24 EVA, to replace faulty ones. The six-pack had been carried up on the Skylab 3 cm. Meanwhile the crew continued with experiments, requesting more work Aug. 14 because all had spare time and \u201cyou just can\u2019t sleep 8 hours up here.\u201d They photographed tropical storm Brenda Aug. 19 as it moved across theYucatan Peninsula toward the Gulf of Mexico. On Aug. 21 Astronaut Bean discovered and photographed through ATM telescopes what Skylab principal investigator Dr. Robert MacQueen called \u201ccertainly one of the biggest solar events\u201d seen on the Skylab missions. Bean said the complex series of events on the solar limb looked \u201clike a big bubble\u201d sitting on the edge of the disc. He observed it with the white light coronagraph and x-ray instruments and reported it to be three fourths the size of the sun. NASA scientists alerted other facilities to make observations from ground instruments and other satellites. Dr. MacQueen said the event might have been caused by an explosion on the back side of the sun. \u201cIt was a beautiful event.\u201d The crew \u201cdid a fine job.\u201d Schneider announced Aug. 23 (MD\u201427) that the Skylab 3 crew had been given permission to continue the mission for another seven days. Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, jsc Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, told the press that he saw nothing in the medical data thus far \u201cthat would indicate that we could not press on with the mission, and ... we feel we can go the full 59 days as planned.\u201d EVA\u20142 began at 12:24 pm edt Aug. 24 with am depressurization by Lousma and Garriott. Lousma completed installation of the six redesigned gyros mounted inside the spacecraft by connecting cables to a computer system outside, and the new gyro system was put into operation. The astronauts installed a sail sample on a hand rail to test durability, replaced ATM film, retrieved and stored cassettes from one experiment, and removed the aperture door ramp latch from two ATM experiments, concluding EVA-2 at 4:31 pm EDT, after 4 hrs 30 min. At 8:01 am edt Aug. 25 (MD\u201429) the Skylab 3 astronauts surpassed the single-mission endurance mark of 28 days 50 min set in June by Skylab 2. They had completed 404 earth orbits and had traveled 18.5 million km (11.5 million mi). And at 6:11 am edt Sept. 5 (MD-40) Astronaut Bean surpassed the space flight record for one man of 49 days 3 hrs 38 min 36 sec, set in June by Charles Conrad, Jr., on Skylab 2. EVA-3 began at 7:18 am edt Sept. 22. Bean and Garriott moved through space to retrieve and replace atm film and retrieve experiments and parasol samples. EVA operations ended at 9:59 am edt, after 2 hrs 41 min. During the mission, spiders Arabella and Anita first spun webs in corners of their cage, without the normal circular pattern. Each day, however, each improved web formation, adding more radials, adjusting to weightlessness. Garriott said of Arabella Aug. 9 that \u201cshe learned very rapidly in zero-g without the benefit of any previous experience.\u201d She \u201cfigured out a very nice solution to the problems of zero gravity.\u201d Later ground controllers told Garriott to share his filet mignon with the spiders to keep them alive for the entire mission. Anita, however, was found dead Sept. 16, possibly from inadequate diet. The astronauts righted the cm and remained inside until the recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans maneuvered alongside and a crane lifted the cm aboard. Immediate medical examinations found the crew in excellent spirits and surprisingly good condition. Blood pressures and heart rates were within normal range. The astronauts would remain aboard ship in San Diego for physical checks and would fly to Houston Sept. 26. They would be quarantined for one week. The Skylab 3 mission achieved its primary objectives of performing unmanned Saturn Workshop operations, reactivating the Skylab orbital assembly in earth orbit, obtaining medical data for use in extending manned space flights, and performing inflight experiments. Despite mission problems, 150% of scheduled atm observing time was accomplished and erep sensors were operated on 39 Z-axis local vertical data runs and 5 solar inertial data runs, completing 218 of the 386 earth resources task sites. All medical experiments were successfully carried out. All but one of the corollary experiments achieved or exceeded objectives. Of 13 student experiments, 9 were completed. Added unscheduled tests and experiments had significantly increased the data yield above premission planning and Skylab was left in an excellent position to complete the final SL-4 mission. Skylab 3 was officially adjudged a success Oct. 11. Major records set by the mission included the longest-duration manned space flight to date, 59 days 11 hrs 9 min; the longest cumulative time in space for one man, 69 days for Bean (who had spent 10 days on the Nov. 14-24, 1969, Apollo 12 mission) ; the longest distance in orbit for a manned mission, 41 000 000 km (25 500 000 mi) ; the longest EVA, 6 hrs 31 min on Aug. 6; and the longest cumulative orbital EVA time, for one astronaut, 13 hrs 40 min for Garriott. In the first mission to man the Orbital Workshop May 15-June 22, Skylab 2 astronauts had conducted medical, solar, and earth resources experiments for 28 days, as well as repairing the Workshop to salvage the mission. The Workshop would be operated unmanned until the November Skylab 4 launch for a third and final mission.

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, praised NASA\u2019s successful efforts to save the Skylab 1\u20142 mission during testimony before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Science hearing to review the Skylab Investigation Report [see July 13]: \u201cWe were able to save Skylab because of the tremendous depth and breadth of the NASA team and the dedication and skills of thousands of people on that team. There certainly isn\u2019t another country that could have reacted as we did. I doubt whether there is another team within this country that could have reacted in this manner. Our team could do it because of years of training, working hard on highly exacting projects, and working as a team to drive toward a technical objective. The performance of the team on the ground, and of course the magnificent performance, skill and courage of the astronauts, saved Skylab. I would hope that this is remembered as the real story of Skylab, not the failure which caused it to happen.\u201d NASA was \u201ctaking all the steps we know how to prevent a future failure due to similar causes in other programs.\u201d Director Bruce T. Lundin of Lewis Research Center testified that, throughout six years of reviews and certifications, \u201cthe principal attention devoted to the meteoroid shield was that of achieving a satisfactory deployment. Never did the matter of aerodynamic loads on the shield or aeroelastic interactions between the shield and its external pressure environment during launch receive the attention and understanding during the design and review process which in retrospect it deserved.\u201d The omission had not been surprising. \u201cFrom the beginning, a basic design concept and requirement was that the shield be tight to the tank.\u201d The question of whether the shield would remain tight against the tank under the dynamics of flight through the atmosphere \u201cwas simply not considered in any coordinated manner.\u201d Possibly contributing to the oversight \u201cwas the basic view of the meteoroid shield as a piece of structure.\u201d No full-time subsystem engineer had been assigned to the shield. \u201cWhile it is recognized that one cannot have a full-time engineer on every piece of equipment, it is . . . possible that the complex interactions and integration of aerodynamics, structure, rigging procedures, ordnance, deployment mechanisms, and thermal requirements of the meteoroid shield would have been enhanced by such an arrangement,\u201d (Testimony)",

A Senate hearing had been held July 30. Lewis Research Center Director Bruce T. Lundin, Skylab 1 Investigation Board Chairman, testified that the failure to recognize design deficiencies in the Orbital Workshop\u2019s meteoroid shield that led to its loss during the May 14^-June 22 Skylab 1\u20142 mission and the failure to communicate the importance of proper venting of the shield must be attributed to \u201can absence of sound engineering judgment and alert engineering leadership . . . over a considerable period of time.\u201d There had been no evidence to indicate that \u201cthe design, development and testing of the meteoroid shield were compromised by limitations of funds or time. The quality of workmanship applied to the shield was adequate for its intended purpose.\u201d Testing emphasis on ordnance performance and shield deployment had been appropriate. \u201cEngineering and management personnel on Skylab, on the part of both contractor and Government, were available from the prior Saturn development and were thus highly experienced and adequate in number.\u201d The Investigation Board had suggested corrective action: omit the meteoroid shield on any future Workshops, coat the Workshop for thermal control, and rely on meteoroid protection from the Workshop tank walls. If further protection was required, the Board had favored a fixed, nondeployable shield. To reduce the probability of separation failures as had occurred at Saturn S-II interstage second separation plane, linear-shaped charges should be detonated simultaneously from both ends, and all ordnance applications should be reviewed for a similar failure mode. Structural systems that had to move or deploy, or that required other mechanisms or components for operation, should not be considered solely as structure; and complex, multidisciplinary systems should have a designated project engineer.

Shapley described nasa\u2019s actions to prevent recurrence of the Skylab Orbital Workshop anomalies: \u201cWe established an independent Investigation Board, have accepted the Board\u2019s report, and have directed all our program and project people to examine their projects in light of the findings of the Board.

This ... is no time to proceed with turkeys and lemons, or to box ourselves into investments in weapons systems whose cost is exceeded only by their irrelevance to such danger as we would be confronting a few years hence if the \u2018worst case\u2019 regarding Soviet armament came true.\u201d Before the issue of phasing out the present U.S. arsenal in favor of less vulnerable sea- and air-based forces, \u201cone reaches the more immediate question of how this Soviet development can or cannot be tamed within the context of the current phase of the arms negotiations.\u201d (W Post, 8/20/73, 24) August 21:\tThe Air Force launched an unidentified satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base by a Titan IIIB-Agena booster into orbit with a 39 132-km (24 315.5-mi) apogee, 392-km (242.6-mi) perigee, 11-hr 41min period, and 63.3° inclination.

The proportion of the gross national product spent for research and development 1963\u20141971 declined in the U.S., France, and the United Kingdom, but increased in the U.S.S.R., Japan, and West Germany. By 1971, U.S. r&d expenditures were 2.6% of GNP, Soviet 3.0%, U.K. and West Germany 2.0%, and Japan and France 1.8% each. The number of scientists and engineers engaged in r&d per 10 000 persons declined in the U.S. after 1969, but continued to increase in the U.S.S.R., Japan, West Germany, and France. All countries reduced the national defense proportion of their R&D expenditures significantly between 1961 and 1969. U.S. defense expenditures dropped from 65% to 49% of total Government R&D spending. Increases in the U.S. and most other countries occurred in space, community services, and economic development. The U.S. had a favorable but declining \u201cpatent balance\u201d between 1966 and 1970, with a reduced number of patents of U.S. origin in France, West Germany, and the U.K. and increased U.S. patents of Japanese origin.

The favorable U.S. balance of trade in technology-intensive products grew 1960-1971, but was increasingly negative in nontechnology-intensive areas. Within technology-intensive areas, products with the fastest rising trade surplus were aircraft, computers, and plastics. (PD, 9/10/73, 1069; Text)",

Twin 26-m (85-ft) solid-fueled-rocket strap-on boosters would be attached to the core. The Titan-Centaur, scheduled to be launched on its proof flight in January 1974, mated the Titan III core vehicle and its twin solid-fueled rockets with the Centaur high-energy liquid-fueled final stage. The 49-m (160-ft), 3610-kg (7959-lb) configuration was designed to carry heavy payloads on orbital and planetary missions, such as the Viking Mars mission and the joint U.S. and West German Helios mission to the sun, during the mid- and late 1970s. The liftoff thrust of the twin solid-fueled boosters was 10.8 million newtons (2.4 million lbs). On its proof flight the Titan-Centaur would carry a mass model of the Viking spacecraft and a 66-kg (145-lb) Space Plasma High Voltage Interaction Experiment (sphinx) spacecraft, to measure in orbit for one year the interaction of space plasmas with high-voltage surfaces. The main purpose of the flight would be to demonstrate that the launch vehicle and launch facilities could support operational missions and that the Centaur could perform an operational two-burn mission and an operational three-burn mission carrying a payload to a synchronous altitude of 35 888 km (22 300 mi). The effort to integrate the Titan with the Centaur had begun in the mid-1960s when NASA recognized the need to fill a performance and cost gap between the Atlas-Centaur and Saturn launch vehicles, (ksc Release 215-73)\t*",

Preliminary laboratory tests had shown \u201ca significant reduction in pollution without an increase in fuel consumption. In fact, our preliminary figures indicate that hydrogen injection may even produce a fuel saving. This comes both from the direct effect of the hydrogen on the combustion process and from the better atomization of the fuel mixture.\u201d Work was progressing at LeRC on a laboratory model of a generator in which the hydrogen would be produced from gasoline and water.

Magnuson (D\u2014Wash.) explained S. 2495, a bill to apply NASA\u2019s expertise to solving domestic problems, during the first day of two-day hearings on the state of the aerospace industry by the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Sen. Magnuson, with Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah) and Sen. John V. Tunney (D-Calif.), introduced the bill Sept. 27. The bill, the Technology Resources Survey and Applications Act, would amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to provide \u201can organization within NASA to carry out programs ... to resolve critical national problems. This would expand an activity already underway within NASA and enable us to better utilize a capability which has already exhibited an impressive record of success.\u201d The programs would be determined by a National Technology Resource Council of Cabinet members and heads of technological agencies, which would make its recommendations to the President. Sen. Magnuson suggested changing NASA\u2019s name to the National Applications of Science Administration. \u201cI do believe the name . . . would accurately reflect the new role which my bill attempts to create for NASA.\u201d Dr. Karl G. Harr, Jr., President of the Aerospace Industries Assn, of America, Inc., testified that foreign competition for U.S. and international aerospace markets was currently \u201cof a scope, determination, and quality that we have not had to face since World War II. The underpinning of strong research and development programs\u2014vital to our technological advance\u2014is being downgraded to a serious degree. There is an alarming scarcity of private sources of financing for the development and production of new commercial aircraft. As a low-profit industry, traditionally averaging a profit about half that of other manufacturing industries, we lack the resources for reinvestment, cushioning against risk, and attracting investors. Above all, there is uncertainty in this transitional period about future national gods which might utilize our capabilities. Will we continue to contribute primarily to space exploration, defense, and long-range air travel, or will we next find ourselves emphasizing such efforts as environmental control, law enforcement, health delivery services, housing, and urban mass transit?\u201d Dr. Wernher von Braun\u2014Vice President, Engineering and Development, Fairchild Industries, Inc., and former NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning\u2014testified on the future of satellite communications: \u201cThere is no field in which the goals of space applications are expanding at a faster rate.\u201d Ever since NASA demonstrated \u201cthat radio signals bounced off passive reflection satellites such as the Echo balloon or rebroadcast by active repeater spacecraft such as Early Bird, worldwide communications by satellite have been growing. . . . Satellites, by providing international telephone and television service, are an important force in overcoming regional and national barriers. It is difficult to maintain hostility and isolation in the presence of free communications.\u201d Satellite communications would \u201csoon be commonplace in our country.\u201d With the advent of the reusable space shuttle to service and repair satellites in the 1980s, \u201ceven nations with limited fiscal resources can put in a network of smaller, far less expensive ground stations.\u201d Thanks to NASA programs initiated a few years ago, \u201cthe United States is still quite active in the area of pioneering new technology for communications satellites.\u201d (Transcript) September 27\u201429:\tThe U.S.S.R. launched Soyuz 12, carrying cosmonauts l/c Vasily G. Lazarev and flight engineer Oleg G. Makarov, from Baykonur Cosmodrome at 5:18 pm local time (3:18 pm Moscow time; 8:18 am edt) into earth orbit with 229-km (142.3-mi) apogee, 180-km (111.8-mi) perigee, 88.6-min period, and 51.7° inclination. Soviet news agency Tass announced the objectives of the two-day mission were to test improved flight systems, test manual and automatic control in various flight conditions, and obtain spectrographic data of separate sections of the earth \u201cfor the solution of economic problems.\u201d The flight would further improve development of manned spacecraft. After six hours in flight the cosmonauts reported they had adjusted to weightlessness and were carrying out all scheduled activities. All spacecraft systems were functioning normally. During the first day, Lazarov\u201445-yr-old air force test pilot and physician\u2014and Makarov\u2014 40-yr-old engineer who had taken part in developing the control board and flight program for Yuri A. Gagarin\u2019s Vostok 1 mission of April 12, 1961\u2014maneuvered their spacecraft in orbit to test manual and automatic control and piloting techniques. The spacecraft was moved into a higher and nearly circular orbit, with parameters reported by Tass as 345-km (214.4-mi) apogee, 326-km (202.6-mi) perigee, 91-min period, and 51.6° inclination. The cosmonauts also made spectrographs of natural formations of the earth\u2019s surface. They were reported Sept. 28 to be in high spirits and good physical condition. Tass reported a new spacecraft design and a new spacesuit, \u201cvery simple and comfortable,\u201d were being tested. Spacesuits were worn for launch and descent but not during the flight itself. On Sept. 29 the crew oriented their spacecraft and fired the braking engine. The landing module separated from the spacecraft and entered descent trajectory. The parachute system was deployed at 7.6 km (4.7 mi) above the earth and engines softlanded the craft 400 km (250 mi) southwest of Karaganda in the Kazakhstan Steppe at 2:34 pm Moscow time (7:34 am edt). A medical check at the landing site showed \u201cthe state of [the cosmonauts\u2019] health is good.\u201d Soyuz 12 was the first Soviet manned space flight since the 1971 Salyut 1-Soyuz 11 mission. Soyuz 10 (launched April 23, 1971, carrying three cosmonauts) had docked with the orbiting Salyut 1 space laboratory (launched April 19) but the cosmonauts had not boarded. American observers believed the Soyuz spacecraft had spun out of control, causing the cosmonauts to become ill and necessitating an early return to earth. Three cosmonauts launched June 6, 1971, on Soyuz 11 had docked with and boarded Salyut 1. They worked successfully in orbit for 24 days but were found dead on landing, from pressure loss in the landing craft, (gsfc SSR, 9/30/73; fbis-Sov, 9/28/73, Ul-A>; 10/1/73, Ul\u20143; SBD, 9/28/73, 138; Kaiser, W Post, 9/28/73, Al; Shabad, NYT, 9/30/73, 1; Seeger, W Post, 9/30/73, 145) September 27:\tThe Air Force launched an unidentified satellite on a Titan IIIB-Agena launch vehicle from Vandenberg Air Force Base into an orbit with a 384.6-km (239-mi) apogee, 128.8-km (80-mi) perigee, 89.8-min period, and 110.5° inclination.

A National Space Club dinner honored leaders who had implemented the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which established NASA Oct. 1, 1958. Honored guests included Dr. T. Keith Glennan, nasa\u2019s first Administrator, Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, the first man on the moon (July 20, 1969), and Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., the first American in space (aboard Freedom 7, May 5, 1961). NASA\u2019s future role was described by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator: \u201cUnless and until Congress sees fit to change our role, I think NASA should continue to have this one primary mission: to do the necessary research and development in space and aeronautics to identify promising opportunities and meet national needs. In performing this primary mission, we will continue to work closely with user agencies in government and with the aerospace industry.\u201d NASA also was transferring its technology and experience to nonaerospace sectors of the economy and helping other Government agencies solve societal problems. \u201cIt so happens that we have the reservoir of technology, and also some available manpower, at a time when the Environmental Protection Agency and other government departments need our help.\u201d NASA had \u201cunique capabilities to help bring into being a pollution-free, resourcesaving hydrogen economy, and to facilitate extensive use of the ultimate energy source, solar power.\u201d NASA\u2019s traditional function as the Nation\u2019s civilian space and aeronautics r&d manager \u201cassures us a challenging and rewarding future during NASA\u2019s next 15 years.\u201d (Program; Prepared text) Anniversary ceremonies also included open house at NASA Centers and annual awards presentations. (NASA Activities, 11/73) During its first 15 yrs NASA had completed 277 major U.S. and international launches, with 210 successful and one still under evaluation. With the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs successfully completed and Skylab progressing, NASA had established 15 768 man-hours in space. Astronauts had spent about 40 hrs in inflight extravehicular activity and more than 90 hrs on the moon. NASA manned spacecraft had spent nearly 400 hrs on the moon and had returned more than 385 kg (850 lbs) of lunar material. Of 38 Americans who had flown in space, 3 had made four space flights, 4 had made three, 10 had made two, and 22 had made one flight each. A dozen astronauts had walked on the moon, and 24 had flown around it. Man had learned he could live and work in space. In unmanned space exploration NASA had launched thousands of sounding rockets carrying U.S. and foreign experiments. Mariner 9 probe (launched May 30, 1971, and still orbiting Mars) had produced 7300 pictures of the planet, showing it to be dynamic and geologically active. Satellites had studied stars beyond the solar system through x-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays. Oao 1 (launched Dec. 7, 1968) and Oao 3 (launched Aug. 21, 1972) had returned a wealth of information on the Milky Way and more distant galaxies. Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972, toward Jupiter) had revolutionized man\u2019s study of the sun. The entire electromagnetic spectrum had been opened to man\u2019s examination by study of stars in ultraviolet and x-ray. Observations from NASA-launched weather satellites had enabled forecasters to observe weather systems from space as they developed and to forecast their effects as they moved into inhabited parts of the world. Man had learned what instruments in space could provide in information about the earth\u2019s resources and their efficient use to facilitate decision making, improve the lot of developing countries, and preserve and improve conditions in countries like the U.S. NASA had provided technological advancements to preserve the U.S. position as world leader in civil and military aeronautics. The joint NASA, Air Force, and Navy X\u201415 rocket-powered aircraft program had, during 10 yrs of flight, studied effects of hypersonic flight on aircraft skin friction and thermal expansion, pioneered the use of ablative coatings, aided efficient structural design, and served as a workhorse test-bed for nearly 40 experiments. NASA contributions also included the single-pivot variable-sweep wing, which allowed efficient flight at both high and low speeds; supercritical wing and fuselage shapes that permitted an aircraft to cruise at 15% higher speed without increased fuel consumption; and the world\u2019s first digital fly-by-wire control aircraft with a computer-controlled electronic system. The clean combustion program was providing new concepts to reduce pollution from engine exhaust. The aircraft noise-abatement program focused on development of an avionics system, refinement of operational procedures, and the demonstration of two-segment flight paths for quieter landing approaches. The refan program was demonstrating JT8D engine and nacelle modifications to reduce noise of existing jet aircraft. In applications the knowledge gained in 15 yrs was being applied in science, medicine, navigation, communications, agriculture, crime prevention, and commerce. NASA-developed technologies were producing safer buildings, bridges, and aircraft and improved tires, roads, and railbeds. In international cooperation, NASA had conducted 18 cooperative satellite and space probe projects and flown 25 international experiments on its spacecraft. The global system of Intelsat communication satellites comprised 12 satellites launched by NASA. Ahead were completion of Skylab 4, the third and final manned Skylab mission; the July 1975 joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz mission to dock a U.S. and a Soviet spacecraft in space; and the introduction of the revolutionary space shuttle with its European-built Spacelab in the 1980s. In unmanned exploration Mariner 10, scheduled for launch toward Mercury and Venus in early November, was expected to provide the first photos of Mercury. Pioneer 10 was headed for a year-end rendezvous with Jupiter, and Pioneer 11 (launched April 5, 1973) was scheduled for a second reconnaissance of Jupiter in December 1974. Work was proceeding on two Mariner spacecraft for 1977 launch toward Jupiter and Saturn. Major thrusts expected for the 1980s were outlined in a statement released to the press by Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator. NASA would be vigorously developing and demonstrating systems and technologies that would make space activities useful to national and world communities, monitoring the environment and resources, developing electric power from the sun, and using space as a laboratory for new technology and processes. Continued scientific exploration of the earth, space, and the solar system seemed inevitable. And the 1980s might well be a period of preparation for continued manned exploration and exploitation of the solar system, the two-way direct transfer of information between satellites, a long-duration manned space laboratory, automated outer planet orbiters and atmosphere probes, and probably, before the end of the century, a program to establish a manned lunar base for exploration and research, (nasa Release 73-190)",

Lunney met with Soviet counterparts in Moscow for two weeks of discussions of technical problems of the joint U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. mission scheduled for July 1975. Discussions culminated in an Oct. 18 midterm review of the project by Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, and Academician Boris N. Petrov, Chairman of the Intercosmos Council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Dr. Low had arrived in Moscow Oct. 14; his stay included visits to the Institute of Geochemistry, the Institute of Space Research, the Cosmonaut Training Center, and the Space Flight Control Center. In an Oct. 18 communique Dr. Low and Academician Petrov confirmed their satisfaction with the astp project status. All major milestones were being met on schedule and, Dr. Low said, progress made indicated that the scheduled launch date could be met. Soyuz orbital and Apollo docking module drawings had been exchanged and agreement had been reached that U.S. specialists would participate in preflight final checkout of flight equipment at the Soviet launch site. Specialists would be exchanged to fit-check compatible equipment at U.S. and U.S.S.R. launch sites. Academician Petrov told the press that U.S. specialists would be permitted at the Soviet launch site \u201cup to the very minute of launching.\u201d During the visit U.S. officials learned the deaths of three cosmonauts on Soyuz 11 June 30, 1971, were caused by accidental triggering open of an exhaust valve rather than by a hatch leak. The valve tripped open just after the reentry capsule separated from the larger orbiting module in a maneuver including firing of 12 explosive bolts. At least two crew members tried to close the valve but were unable to move fast enough. Unconsciousness from rapid decompression came in less than 10 sec; ground tests showed it would take 27 sec to close the valve by hand. U.S. officials said they were satisfied that subsequent modifications to the valve and crank mechanisms\u2014tested on two unmanned flights, Cosmos 496 and 573, and on the manned Sept. 27-29 Soyuz 12 mission \u2014were sufficient to prevent reoccurrence of the accident.

At a postflight crew press briefing, Skylab 3 Astronaut Alan L. Bean \u2014who had splashed down Sept. 25, after a 59-day mission working in the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop (launched May 14) with crew members Dr. Owen K. Garriott and Jack R. Lousma\u2014said that the crew\u2019s health had been \u201cgood the whole time.\u201d Sufficient exercise, meals on time, and plenty of sleep had accounted f or their happiness and well-being. Having a scientist-astronaut aboard had created a \u201cgreater variety of interchange around the dinner table,\u201d making \u201ca better mission for everybody.\u201d The mission would have been \u201c50% less productive if Owen had not been there. He added a great amount to it . . . because his point of view is, just different.\u201d Garriott said that a longer mission would necessitate \u201ca somewhat less strenuous program,\u201d but he could have spent eight hours a day at the wardroom window with a camera in each hand and a good supply of film \u201cand never have any tendency to become bored.\u201d Lousma said he still felt \u201ca little less energetic\u201d than before the mission, but within two weeks \u201cI\u2019ll be back to the same condition.\u201d Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, jsc Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, said that the crew was \u201cin very good shape\u201d but still had dizziness with specific head movements. Strength of the flexor and extensor muscles had decreased 20%. The astronauts\u2019 weights were steadily climbing toward their preflight weights. Early blood tests had shown the red cell mass was down an average of 12% for all three crew members. The blood plasma was also down 15% to 20%. In an overview of Skylab 4, the third and final manned Skylab mission, Skylab Program Office Manager Kenneth S. Kleinknecht said that the spacecraft (Command and Service Module 118) and crew members Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue were being readied for Nov. 11 launch. Final decision on the launch date would be made after further evaluation of the mission. In preparation, 140 kg (300 lbs) of operational equipment had been deleted from stowage. It had been replaced with another 150 kg (300 lbs) of operational equipment, 60 kg (130 lbs) for Skylab experiments, and 70 kg (150 lbs) of special equipment for Comet Kohoutek observations. After Oct. 8\u201410 flight readiness tests, only servicing, stowage, pyrotechnic installations, countdown demonstrations, and launch would remain. CSM\u2014119, the rescue vehicle, was being prepared and would be available for a Jan. 6 launch if needed. Alfred A. Bishop, Manager of the jsc Missions Office, said that, after the first two weeks of acclimation, the Skylab 4 crew would perform 28 man-hours of experiments each day, an increase from the 19 to 221/j man-hours on Skylab 3. The increase would provide an additional 200 experiment man-hours. The crew would observe Comet Kohoutek, perform 12 experiments using the Apollo Telescope Mount, observe Mercury crossing the sun Nov. 10, observe a solar eclipse, and perform 10 to 14 new earth resources experiment package passes.

Since then, four administrations have committed our industrial resources, our technological and scientific capacities and the national will to the proposition that America can and must play a role in outer space equal to its responsibilities as a great nation.\u201d People of all nations stood in awe of NASA\u2019s accomplishments. \u201cThe men of NASA have undertaken one of the greatest human adventures with such consummate skill, cool exactness in the face of untold dangers, and professional disdain for the sensational that we have come already to take for granted the legitimacy of man\u2019s place in an environment entirely alien to him. But neither the courage, skill and devotion of the men of NASA, nor the benefits of their efforts, should be taken for granted. In every phase of our national life, new products, new techniques and new understanding have resulted from our efforts in space. And in relations between nations, the prospects for a lasting peace have been enhanced by the now absolute awareness that the primary interests of mankind are identical and shared in common. On the fifteenth anniversary of NASA, we look ahead to the same ordered progress into our space future which has characterized our first tentative steps into space.\u201d (Text)",

Federal support for civilian research and development had risen 9.1% per year for the past five years. The chief areas of growth were health, transportation and communication, environment, and crime prevention and control. In 1969 civilian-oriented programs had constituted nearly 25%, or $3.6 billion, of a $15.6 billion total; they were expected to form 33.3% of the 1974 $17.4 billion total. National security took up more than 50% of the R&D total each year. In 1974, its growth in R&D obligations was expected to be $478 million, making the national security share of the Federal r&d total 54.2%, higher than any other year since 1969. Space remained the second function in funding size 1969-1974, but reflected the greatest loss in priority. Space r&d obligations showed a steady annual decrease, and the share in the r&d total had declined correspondingly, from 23.9% in 1969 to 14.1% in 1974. From 1973 to 1974, total r&d obligations for space were expected to drop by $234 million, the largest decrease for any function.

(Sullivan, NYT, 10/30/73, 29) NASA and the Dept, of Defense were in the final phase of a joint study to determine the most efficient development method for the shuttle space tug, or upper stage, for high-energy orbit missions. \u201cOne consideration is the adaptation of existing stages such as the Agena, Centaur, or Tran-stage, which could be modified for use with the shuttle. Since the modification . . . would not satisfy all of the science, application and DOD requirements that are now projected for the 1980s, we are also examining costs and technical characteristics of new configurations which would have the performance capability required to accommodate the entire range of prospective payloads. It may be possible to phase these two Tug approaches in a way that will provide adequate transportation capability when needed while reducing near-term funding requirements.

After a 25-min coast, a 130-sec burn of the Centaur engines injected the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit that would allow Mariner 10 to pass within 5300 km (3300 mi) of Venus Feb. 5, 1974. Using the gravitational field of Venus to change the speed and flight path of the spacecraft, Mariner 10 would travel toward a March 29 encounter with Mercury, approaching the sun more closely than any other planetary mission. Mariner 10 would be the first spacecraft to use gravity assist in a dual-planet mission and the first to explore Mercury. The primary objective was to measure Mercury\u2019s environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the interplanetary medium and to obtain experience with a dual-planet gravity-assist mission. PRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED! The seven experiments aboard the octagonal 503-kg (1108-lb) spacecraft included a TV camera and an infrared radiometer to investigate the planet\u2019s surface; plasma science experiment, charged particle telescope, and magnetometer to investigate the environment around the planet and the interplanetary medium; dual-frequency-radio science experiment and ultraviolet spectrometer to measure characteristics of the Mercury neutral atmosphere and ionosphere if they existed; and celestial mechanics experiments to measure planetary mass characteristics and test the theory of relativity. All experiments had been designed and selected for their Mercury scientific objectives but also would obtain important data at Venus and during the cruise phases. The Tidbinbilla, Australia, tracking station was unable to maintain command lock with the spacecraft following spacecraft injection. Acquisition of the star Vega by the spacecraft Canopus tracker also was delayed, but two-way communications were established within an hour and, after repeated commands, Vega was acquired. Solar panels, high-gain and low-gain antennas, and plasma science and magnetometer booms were deployed. On Nov. 4-5 four moon and three earth TV picture mosaics were completed. By Nov. 6 the spacecraft was 1 394 000 km (866 000 mi) from the earth, traveling at a speed of 4.32 km (2.68 mi) per sec. All science experiments except the infrared radiometer and electrostatic analyzer had been turned on. The scanning electron spectrometer portion of the plasma science experiment was not operating properly and the problem was being analyzed. Four trajectory correction maneuvers were scheduled during the mission. The first, Nov. 13, successfully adjusted the flight path for closest approach to Venus on Feb. 5, 1974, as planned. A second would be made Jan. 18, 1974. On Feb. 9 and March 1, 1974, after the Venus encounter, maneuvers would target the Mariner 10 to pass Mercury at 1000-km (620-mi) altitude. The Mariner program, including mission operations and tracking and data systems, was managed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory under the direction of NASA\u2019s Office of Space Science. Lewis Research Center, with contractor General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., was responsible for the launch vehicle. Previous missions had been made to Mars, including Mariner 4, 6, 7, and 9 (launched Nov. 28, 1964; Feb. 24, 1969; March 27, 1969; and May 30, 1971). Mariner 9 had been the first spacecraft to orbit a planet other than the earth. All others had been flyby missions. (nasa prog off; jpl Release 673) November 3\u2014January 9, 1974:\tNASA\u2019s Pioneer 10 interplanetary probe (launched March 2, 1972) became the first spacecraft to reach Jupiter during a two-month encounter, returning new findings about the giant planet and continuing toward Uranus and eventual exit from the solar system. November 3\u2014December 3:\tEncounter operations were begun Nov. 3 by Ames Research Center controllers and scientists and on Nov. 4 Pioneer 10 began sending photopolarimeter images of Jupiter to the earth three to eight hours a day. By Nov. 6 the spacecraft, 25 000 000 km (15 500 000 mi) from Jupiter, had begun measuring the placet\u2019s atmosphere above Jupiter\u2019s orange-and-blue-striped cloud tops and the characteristics of particles making up the dense clouds. On Nov. 8 the spacecraft crossed the orbits of Hades and Poseidon, the first two of Jupiter\u2019s outer moons, and on Nov. 9 and 11 it crossed the orbits of Pan and Andrastea. At a Nov. 19 press briefing at arc Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science, said that low temperature in that area of the solar system slowed evolution and scientists hoped to find objects not very different from what they were at their formation. \u201cThe passage of Pioneer 10 past Jupiter also marks the gateway to the exploration of the outer solar system. This is an exploration which is critical if we truly want to understand the formation and evolution of our solar system.\u201d Dr. William H. Kinard, Langley Research Center scientist, said that Pioneer 10 had encountered 100 times more space dust than expected during the journey between the Asteroid Belt and Jupiter. He expected that 30 times more particles would be detected as the spacecraft neared Jupiter. Pioneer 10 crossed the orbits of Jupiter\u2019s moons Demeter, Hera, and Hestia Nov. 22 and was 11400 600 km (7 084 000 mi) from Jupiter. By Nov. 25 a charged particle detector aboard the spacecraft had begun to show traces of particle radiation. Preliminary indications were that the probe was beginning to cross into Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere, estimated to be 20 times stronger than the earth\u2019s. The planet\u2019s radiation belts contained particle concentrations up to 1 million times higher than the earth\u2019s Van Allen Belt and were considered by some scientists to be extremely dangerous to the spacecraft\u2019s electronics. At a distance of 8 336 400 km (5180 000 mi) from Jupiter, spacecraft instruments began returning pictures of Jupiter\u2019s great red spot. The final spacecraft-attitude change before encounter was made Nov. 26 and a 24-hour day of imaging and polarimetry began. At 3:30 pm EST Nov. 26 Pioneer 10 successfully crossed Jupiter\u2019s bow shock wave at a distance of 7 709 000 km (4 790 000 mi)\u2014with great turbulence when the solar wind hit Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. The spacecraft was unaffected by the turbulence hut data from 6 of its 11 instruments changed dramatically. Solar wind speed abruptly decreased to half the normal velocity and solar wind temperatures rose sharply. On Nov. 27, at a distance of 6 760 000 km (4 200 000 mi) from Jupiter, the spacecraft crossed into the planet\u2019s true magnetic envelope, the region of interplanetary space into which the solar wind could not penetrate. Pioneer 10 crossed the magnetopause, entering the magnetic field for the first time at 3:30 pm est. At a Nov. 29 press briefing arc scientists said new data had shown the reach of Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field to be greater than predicted. It stretched more than 13 000 000 km (8 000 000 mi) in diameter and its strength was 40 times that of the earth\u2019s ma'gnetic field. Its direction was south, rather than north as predicted. The strength of the magnetism at 6 400 000 km (4 000 000 mi) from the planet seemed to rise and fall in a regular 10-hour phase, possibly because of the planet\u2019s rotation. Jupiter\u2019s mass was also found to be greater than estimated and the spacecraft was being drawn toward Jupiter faster than planned; it would arrive at its closest approach two minutes earlier than predicted. On Nov. 30 Pioneer 10 recorded a sharp drop in magnetic and radiation measurements, indicating disappearance of the magnetic field. Eleven hours later the spacecraft again crossed the magnetopause, which had apparently been driven toward the planet by a disturbance in the solar wind. At 1 427 500 km (887 000 mi) from the planet, the spacecraft entered Jupiter\u2019s dipole magnetic field. Preliminary data indicated that the outer portions of Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field did not rotate with the planet and were more flattened than the earth\u2019s field. Also, the magnetic dipole center was appreciably offset, both radially and toward the north from the center of the planet. The magnetic axis was tilted from the spin axis. Pioneer 10 crossed the orbits of Jupiter\u2019s innermost moons\u2014Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Io\u2014Dec. 2-3. As it came within 446 000 km (277 000 mi) of Ganymede, the infrared radiometer indicated the moon\u2019s surface temperature was 125 K (\u2014235°F). Six hours before its closest approach to Jupiter the probe entered the dangerous region of intense radiation and, soon after, the imaging system ceased returning picture data. Radio commands switched the system back to normal operation within 30 minutes, however. The press later reported that NASA attributed the mishap to an unidentified flight control room guest who had inadvertently pressed against a cathode ray display, pushing a button that cut out eight instruments. December 3\u201411:\tAs the gold and silver spacecraft approached Jupiter and radiation intensity increased 10-fold every two hours, reaching 65 million ev 90 min before periapsis, tense scientists paced the floor of arc\u2019s Mission Control with fingers crossed. At 9:25 pm est Dec. 3, after a flight of 641 days and 826 000 000 km (513 000 000 mi), Pioneer 10 sped past Jupiter at an altitude of 130 000 km (81 000 mi), traveling 155 140 km per hour (96 400 mph), the fastest speed ever achieved by a man-made object. The spacecraft\u2019s 11 instruments sent back readings and pictures that came in loud and clear, taking 46 minutes to reach a jubilant team on earth. \u201cNeedless to say, we\u2019re elated,\u201d Dr. John Wolfe, Pioneer Project Scientist, told cheering newsmen. The Washington Post later described the scene at arc: \u201cSo deluged were Pioneer scientists with transmissions of the spacecraft\u2019s instruments, they were literally changing their minds about Jupiter\u2019s physics and chemistry every hour.\u201d Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said, \u201cSome of us have been looking through telescopes at Jupiter since our early teens. This is more than we ever dreamed of.\u201d The spacecraft suffered no apparent failures and continued to function as planned. However, preliminary estimates of radiation belt parameters and observed effects on the spacecraft and instrumentation indicated that the margin of survival had been small. As Pioneer 10 flew by Jupiter, the spacecraft was accelerated and slung by the planet\u2019s gravity into a new trajectory that would take it past the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto and, traveling at a constant 40 000 km per hr (25 000 mph), out of the solar system toward the constellation Taurus. Pioneer 10 would be the first spacecraft to leave the solar system. By 7:00 pm EST Dec. 4, it had traveled nearly 1600 000 km (1000 000 mi) beyond Jupiter. December 11\u2014January 9:\tarc Mission Control ended Jupiter picturetaking Dec. 11 and returned to routine interplanetary operations. The spacecraft recrossed the bow shock wave Dec. 12 and continued into interplanetary space. By Dec. 14 the spacecraft was 10 881000 km (6 761 000 mi) from Jupiter, traveling at 83 525 km per hr (51 900 mph) toward the edge of the solar system. Preliminary findings from the encounter included the discovery of an ionosphere (implying a tenuous atmosphere) surrounding Jupiter\u2019s moon Io, detection of helium in Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, new density measurements of the entire Jovian system that would affect current theories on the formation of the universe, and new temperature measurements of Jupiter that indicated little difference between average daytime and nighttime temperatures. Pioneer 10 was expected to continue collecting and returning data until it reached the orbit of Uranus in 1980, almost 3 200 000 000 km (2 000 000 000 mi) from the earth. Data returned would determine whether the second Jupiter probe, Pioneer 11 (launched April 5 and crossing the Asteroid Belt since August), could safely be retargeted closer to the planet. The Pioneer 10 mission was officially adjudged a success Jan. 9, 1974. The Pioneer program, begun in 1958, was directed by arc. Pioneer 6 and 7 (launched Dec. 16, 1965, and Aug. 17, 1966, to study the heliocentric space environment) and Pioneer 8 and 9 (launched Dec. 13, 1967, and Nov. 8, 1969, to study interplanetary phenomena) continued to supply data from heliocentric orbit on solar plasma, magnetic and electric fields, and cosmic rays, (nasa prog off; arc Release, 11/6/73; nasa Releases 73-243K, 73-256, 73-279; Wilford, NYT, 11/25/73; 11/30/73, 1; 12/4/73, 1; 12/5/73, 13; O\u2019Toole, W Post, 12/4/73, Al; AP, W Star-News, 11/28-29/73; AP, B Sun, 12/3-4/73; Miles, LA Times, 12/4/73; 12/6/73) November 3:\tThe Skylab 4 launch crew successfully completed a simulated launch of the Saturn IB booster at Kennedy Space Center.

Garriott, Jr., received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Phillips Univ. during Homecoming Day ceremonies in his home town of Enid, Okla. (Oklahoma Journal, 11/15/73) November 16\u2014February 8, 1974:\tThe Skylab 4 Apollo spacecraft carrying a three-man crew was launched into near-earth orbit and rendezvoused and docked with the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop (launched May 14) for the third and final manned mission in the Skylab program. Despite persistent problems with the spacecraft\u2019s onboard control moment gyroscopes, the crew proceeded successfully, making four space walks and setting new manned flight records. The astronauts collected significant data in medical experiments, astronomy (including 121 observations of Comet Kohoutek), and earth resources surveys for 84 days before undocking for a safe return to earth Feb. 8, 1974. The CSM/S-IVB combination was placed in a phasing orbit with a 222.3-km (138.1-mi) apogee and 148.2-km (92.1-mi) perigee 9 min 45 sec after launch. Eight minutes later the CSM separated from the stage. The S-IVB/iU deorbit maneuver was commanded on the third orbit and the stage impacted in the Pacific Ocean at 3:00 pm EST. After five rocket maneuvers the CSM rendezvoused with the Orbital Workshop during the fifth orbit. Docking was achieved at 5:02 pm EST after two unsuccessful attempts. Carr radioed down to Mission Control, \u201cGreat to be home.\u201d During rendezvous and docking Pogue suffered from motion sickness and vomited. Later, in a conversation unintentionally taped by the astronauts and transmitted to the ground the astronauts decided not to report the incident to ground controllers. Capsule communicator Alan B.\tShepard later told the crew, \u201cWe think you made a fairly serious error in judgment\u201d in the attempt to cover up Pogue\u2019s condition. Carr agreed, \u201cIt was a dumb decision.\u201d Pogue recovered by late evening, Carr suffered only minor motion sickness problems, and Gibson remained in good health. Carr, Gibson, and Pogue entered the multiple docking adapter at 9:32 am est Nov. 17 (Mission Day 2) and began Workshop activation. They found a welcoming note on the teleprinter: \u201cJerry, Ed and Bill, welcome aboard the space station Skylab. Hope you enjoy your stay. We\u2019re looking forward to several months of interesting and productive work. Signed, Flight Control.\u201d In addition they found three dummies dressed in tan flight suits left by Skylab 3 Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Dr. Owen K. Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma. Pogue replenished the fluid in the Workshop\u2019s primary cooling system, which had developed a leak during the Skylab 3 mission [see July 28\u2014Sept 25]. The 5l^-hr task required Pogue to punch a hole into the plumbing lines to inject the fluid. Spacecraft activation was completed Nov. 21. November 22\u2014February 4:\tThe first extravehicular activity (EVA1) began at 12:44 pm est Nov. 22. Pogue and Gibson moved through space to install film cassettes in the Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) cameras, deploy experimental hardware, and repair the control system for an earth-scanning antenna that had jammed during the Skylab 3 mission. Gibson, anchored in a portable foot restraint on the bottom of the spacecraft, held onto Pogue while Pogue rewired the instrument, bypassing a short circuit and restoring the antenna to 80% of its original capacity. Gibson and Pogue reentered the Workshop and began pressurization at 6:19 pm EST. The 6-hr 35-min eva surpassed the 6-hr 31-min record set Aug. 6 by Skylab 3 Astronauts Garriott and Lousma. At 3:45 am est Nov. 23 one of three moment gyros which controlled the spacecraft overheated and was ordered shut down by Flight Controller Philip C. Shaffer. Shaffer told the press at Johnson Space Center that a near-normal mission could still be flown but it would take more time and fuel to make maneuvers. Pogue began extensive photographic study of Comet Kohoutek. By the end of the mission Comet Kohoutek had been observed and recorded 121 times as it approached, looped around, and retreated from the sun. The first full day of scientific research was scheduled for Nov. 27. While photographing a barium cloud\u2014created by the launch of a Black Brant IVA sounding rocket from Poker Flats, Alaska\u2014the spacecraft\u2019s thruster attitude-control system used three times the amount of nitrogen gas fuel anticipated. The extra fuel use, in addition to poor weather conditions, forced postponement of the first earth resources experiment package (erep) pass while ground teams designed improved techniques for managing attitude control and fuel consumption. For the first time Carr pointed the space station\u2019s six large solar telescopes at an unusually active region of the sun. The first erep pass was made Nov. 29 during a 23-min 8850-km (5500-mi) sweep from the southwestern U.S. to South America. In a Johnson Space Center press conference Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said that the ground team had concluded that the Nov. 28 problem had been caused by an incorrect input of initial conditions into the fuel management program. Restrictions on maneuvers were eliminated and, with proper fuel management, the mission could \u201ccontinue essentially as planned.\u201d On Dec. 1 the astronauts photographed a laser beam pointed at them by Goddard Space Flight Center scientists who were testing the lasers as a reference point for possible use in spacecraft navigation and communications. Earlier attempts to spot the flashing green laser had failed. In a Dec. 13 Mission Day 28 Review of the first third of the mission Program Director Schneider said the Skylab 4 crew had accomplished 84 hrs of atm solar viewing, 45 separate observations of Comet Kohoutek, 80 earth observation experiments, and 12 erep passes, although a significant portion of the data from 9 passes had been lost because of wrong camera filters. Schneider said that the crew was in good physical and mental health and that their performance had been outstanding, but flight planners had needed to adjust work schedules to the pace of the crew. A spectacular limb prominence on the sun, estimated to be the largest observed in 25 yrs, was recorded by the crew Dec. 18\u201419. Astronauts Carr and Pogue opened the hatch for EVA-2 at 11:55 am est Dec. 25, Christmas Day. Pogue mounted three special cameras to photograph the sun and Comet Kohoutek before it passed behind the sun. Photographs were taken of the comet\u2019s tail and coma. Carr replaced film cassettes in the atm and repaired a jammed filter on an ATM camera. The constant movement of Carr and Pogue outside the spacecraft disrupted Gibson\u2019s efforts to aim the laboratory cameras at Kohoutek and the thruster attitude control system used more fuel than planned. Carr and Pogue reentered the Workshop and closed the hatch at 6:56 pm EST after a 7-hr 1-min spacewalk that surpassed Gibson and Pogue\u2019s Nov. 22 record. The Dec. 28 perihelion passage of Comet Kohoutek was marked with a live ground-to-air televised conference between Dr. Lubos Kohoutek, discoverer of the comet (1973F), and the Skylab 4 crew. Gibson said that the comet, as seen on the white-light coronagraph, was growing dramatically. The tail fanned out 20° from the central axis and could be seen back to a distance three times the diameter of the coma. Dr. Kohoutek congratulated the \u201cfirst human beings studying a comet from outer space\u201d and wished them a flawless splashdown in February. The crew began EVA\u20143 at 12:29 pm est Dec. 29. Carr and Gibson moved outside to photograph the sun and Comet Kohoutek as it began its trajectory away from the sun. Gibson said the comet had a spike and a tail. \u201cThat spike is very evident. It is not 180 degrees out from the tail, but more like 160 degrees. It is yellow and orange . . . just like a flame. It seems to be the same distance out as the tail, and there is a diffuse amount of material which goes out and joins up with the tail.\u201d The astronauts recorded other astronomical phenomena, retrieved samples from the magnetospheric particle collector, and retrieved the comet observation camera. At 3:58 pm EST Carr and Gibson moved back inside the Workshop and closed the hatch after 3 hrs 29 min. On Jan. 10 the mission was given a go-ahead for a seven-day extension, with weekly reviews through the end of a tentative 84-day total mission. In the 56-day mission review at JSC, Skylab Program Director Schneider said the crew was \u201cin good spirits and excellent physical condition and the spacecraft is in good shape to continue.\u201d On Jan. 13 and 14 the Skylab 4 crew photographed a solar flare from beginning to end\u2014the first opportunity for scientists to study the complete life cycle of a solar flare. At 10:10 pm edt Jan. 14 Carr, Gibson, and Pogue had been in orbit 59 days 11 hrs 9 min, surpassing the record manned flight time in space on a single flight set by Skylab 3 Astronauts Bean, Garriott, and Lousma during their July 28\u2014Sept. 25 mission. Mission controllers struggled with gyroscope problems with increasing frequency throughout the mission. On Jan. 22 the second control moment gyro was in the distress position for six hours, causing Skylab officials to order the recovery force into port at San Diego three days earlier than planned, erep passes were limited and other maneuvers reduced to conserve fuel and reduce stress. Despite nearly three dozen gyro 2 stress periods, gyros 2 and 3 held up for the rest of the mission. At 1:46 pm edt Jan. 25 (MD\u201471) the crew passed the record cumulative time in space of 69 days 15 hrs 45 min set by Bean during the Skylab 3 mission. The hatch was opened for EVA-^1 at 11:19 am edt Feb. 3. Gibson and Carr measured the atmosphere surrounding the Skylab solar instruments to evaluate the light-scattering produced when photos of the sun were taken. The astronauts also photographed the sun with an x-ray sensitive camera, retrieved film from ATM cameras, and removed a plate and piece of rubberized material from the side of the spacecraft for a study of effects of nine-month exposure to the space environment. eva operations ended at 4:38 pm edt after 5 hrs 19 min. The csm undocked from the Workshop at 6:34 am edt Feb. 8 (MD-85) and made a fly-around inspection of the Workshop. One of two redundant CSM rocket thruster systems developed a leak during reentry preparation, forcing the astronauts' to reenter without a. backup thruster system. Just before sm jettison at 10:45 am edt, a procedural error caused circuit breakers to open, blocking the stabilization and control thrusters from firing. Carr quickly took manual control for reentry. The cm splashed down upside down at 11:17 am edt Feb. 8, 282 km (175 mi) southwest of San Diego and 5 km (3 mi) from the recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans\u2014ending 1214 revolutions of the earth. The capsule was righted by flotation bags while the carrier maneuvered alongside, and the CM was raised by a crane to the hangar deck about 40 min after landing. Immediate medical examinations found the crew had no apparent severe effects from their long exposure to weightlessness. They had grown one to two inches taller from stretched spinal columns in space and had lost some muscle mass, with body fluids readjusted for zero gravity; but they lost most of the slim-trim look on return to the earth. They were back to normal in a few days. The astronauts would remain aboard ship in San Diego for medical examinations and, after a brief dockside ceremony Feb. 10, would fly to Houston. The men would be allowed to rejoin their families but contact with the general public would be restricted for one week. The Skylab 4 mission achieved its primary objectives of performing Saturn Workshop operations, reactivating the Skylab orbital assembly in earth orbit, obtaining medical data for use in extending the duration of manned space flights, and performing inflight experiments. All 58 planned scientific and technical experiments in biomedicine, solar astronomy, solar physics, and engineering were accomplished, erep instruments were operated during 39 passes over the earth and the crew spent 338 hrs photographing the sun and Comet Kohoutek with atm instruments. Skylab 4 was officially adjudged a success Mar. 29, 1974. Major records set by the mission included the longest-duration manned space flight to date, 84 days 1 hr 16 min; the longest cumulative time in space for a man, 84 days each for Carr, Gibson, and Pogue; the longest orbital EVA, 7 hrs 1 min Dec. 25; the longest cumulative inflight eva time for one mission, 22 hrs 24 min; and the longest distance in orbit for a manned mission, 55.5 million km (34.5 million mi). Skylab 4 was the third and final mission to man the Skylab Orbital Workshop. Skylab 2 astronauts had worked aboard the laboratory 28 days, May 15-June 22, conducting experiments as well as making repairs to the orbital assembly to salvage the Skylab program. The Skylab 3 crew collected data in medical experiments, solar astronomy, and earth resources surveys for 59 days, July 28-Sept. 25.

All spacecraft systems were checked out by Dec. 20 and were functioning normally. Experiment instrumentation checkout would be completed by Dec. 31. The Explorer 51 mission would consist of two phases. During Phase 1, excursions would be made at two- to four-week intervals, each lasting several days. The spacecraft perigee would be lowered in steps through a range of 150 to 125 km (95 to 80 mi). At each perigee step, telemetry data would be acquired. Phase 2 would begin after eight months and last four months; the spacecraft would be placed in a series of circular orbits ranging between 250 and 800 km (155 and 500 mi) in altitude. Explorer 51 carried 14 scientific instruments provided by a research team of scientists from nine institutions. In addition to the investigation of solar uv activity, the instrumentation would examine particle fluxes, airglow intensities, plasma densities, and temperatures and magnetic fields at low altitudes. To use the full spacecraft and instrument capabilities, a new rapid-response data system would provide data reduced to physical parameters, allowing the spacecraft to operate as a laboratory-in-space periodically reprogrammed to make optimum measurements in the light of interim results rather than gathering data in predetermined modes. Explorer 17 (launched April 2, 1963), the first ae satellite, had confirmed that the earth was surrounded by a belt of neutral helium. The second, Explorer 32 (launched May 25, 1966), was placed in a higher orbit than planned but the higher altitude enhanced the resolution of the measured atmospheric parameters. The spacecraft continued to return useful data for 10 mos.

He had been honored on his 100th birthday in 1972 by having a site on the moon named after him by the International Geophysical Union. Dr. Abbot, an astrophysicist, had specialized in solar energy. In 1938 he had patented a solar engine that focused sunlight, using mirrors and sapphire lenses, into a steel cylinder where superheated air performed the same function as expanding steam in a locomotive or turbine. He refined the engine in a later patent, but never found anyone to build a prototype. At his 100th birthday celebration he said, \u201cThe sun will be there long after we need it. I wish I had gotten to work on this sooner.\u201d (Hailey, W Post, 12/18/73, Bll; A&A 1972) The Soviet news agency Tass announced the objectives of the mission were to observe stars in the ultraviolet range using a special system of telescopes, survey separate sections of the earth\u2019s surface and obtain data \u201cfor the accomplishment of economic tasks,\u201d continue comprehensive verification of onboard systems, and test manual and automatic controls and methods of autonomous navigation in various flight conditions. Western observers also expected the cosmonauts to study Comet Kohoutek as it approached the sun. The Western press reported that Soyuz 13 was the same kind of modified Soyuz capsule as would be used for the U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project scheduled for 1975. It would test a new navigational system that would increase the cosmonauts\u2019 ability to fly the spacecraft themselves rather than relying on ground control, ensuring that the quality of the spacecraft support system would match that of the Apollo. During the fifth orbit the spacecraft moved into a higher orbit with parameters reported by Tass as 272-km (169-mi) apogee, 225-km (139.8-mi) perigee, 89.2-min period, and 51.6° inclination. At 5:30 pm Moscow time (9:30 am est) Soyuz 13 had made 18 orbits of earth. The cosmonauts reported they had adjusted to weightlessness and were carrying out their scheduled scientific program. Tass reported Dec. 20 that the crew had harvested the first crop of nutritive protein mass in an onboard experimental biological system, Oasis 2. In a closed system of two kinds of microorganisms, the waste products from the synthesis of the first were used by the second to accumulate protein mass. During the eight-day mission, the cosmonauts also aimed the telescope at preset areas of the sky, photographing constellations; studied cerebral circulation under weightless conditions; studied natural resources on the earth; took x-ray photos of the sun; and photographed light effects before sunset and sunrise along the line of the terrestrial horizon to further development of autonomous navigation for future interplanetary journeys. Soyuz 13 landed successfully in a snowstorm and cyclonic winds at 11:50 am Moscow time (3:50 am est) Dec. 26, 200 km (125 mi) southwest of Karaganda in the Kazakhstan Steppe. A medical examination indicated the cosmonauts were in good health. Soyuz 13 was the second Soviet manned launch in 1973. Soyuz 12, during a successful two-day mission Sept. 27\u201429, had tested improved flight systems, tested manual and automatic control in various flight conditions, and obtained spectrographic data of separate sections of the earth.

Its Christmas season timing had revived speculation about the nature of the star reported to have led the Wise Men to Bethlehem. One theory had been that it was a comet similar to Kohoutek. Some Protestant fundamentalists had ascribed religious significance to Kohoutek and saw it as a possible sign of the second coming of Christ. Others interpreted it as a warning of impending doom.

Morrow, Jr., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Lincoln Laboratory said in a Technology Review article. \u201cThis is about 0.03 per cent of the U.S. land area devoted to farming and about 2 per cent of the land area devoted to roads; and it is about equal to the roof area of all the buildings in the U.S.\u201d (Tech Rev, 12/73, 31^3) During 1973: The U.S. put 26 payloads into orbit in 23 launches and the U.S.S.R. orbited 107 payloads in 86 launches. The U.S. total included 13 spacecraft orbited by the Dept, of Defense in 10 launches (2 of them multiple launches) and 13 by nasa. nasa\u2019s 13 successful launches out of 14 attempts nearly matched the agency\u2019s 1972 record of 17 flawless launches out of 17 attempts. NASA\u2019s Skylab program successfully launched the first U.S. experimental space station\u2014the Orbital Workshop\u2014and three successive crews to man it. Skylab 4, the final mission and the longest-duration manned space flight to date (84 days 1 hr 16 min), also set records for man\u2019s cumulative time in space (84 days), duration of extravehicular activity (7 hrs 1 min), cumulative orbital eva time for one mission (22 hrs 21 min), and distance in orbit for a manned mission (55.5 million km; 34.5 million mi). By the year\u2019s end the Workshop had circled the earth more than 3350 times and housed nine astronauts. The Skylab 2 crew\u2019s repair in space of the Skylab 1 Workshop, after aerodynamic forces damaged it during liftoff, salvaged the endangered program and proved man could do difficult construction work in space. The Skylab 2 crew spent 28 days in space and the Skylab 3 crew 59 days, each mission a record at the time. The missions proved man could live and work in space for extended periods; expanded solar astronomy beyond earth-based observations, collecting much valuable new data that might revise understanding of the sun and its effects on the earth; and improved techniques for surveying earth resources from space, returning more information than planned. In NASA\u2019s unmanned program, Pioneer 10 (launched in 1972) swept past Jupiter in December 1973 at a distance of 130 000 km (81 00Q mi). The first spacecraft to fly beyond the orbit of Mars and to penetrate the Asteroid Belt capped its two-year, 826-million-km (514-million-mi) journey by returning more than 300 closeup photos of Jupiter and its inner moons and providing new information on the planet\u2019s atmosphere and magnetic field. By the year\u2019s end Pioneer 10 was beginning its five-year extended mission to reach Saturn\u2019s orbit in 1976 and the orbit of Uranus, the limit of spacecraft communications with the earth, in 1979. Thereafter it was to become the first man-made object to escape the solar system. Pioneer 11, launched in April, had passed safely through three fourths of the Asteroid Belt on its way to its December 1974 encounter with Jupiter. Mariner 10, headed toward Mercury via Venus, was more than 14.5 million km (9 million mi) from the earth; it would pass by Venus in February 1974 and would provide the first closeup view of Mercury in March. NASA also selected landing sites for the Viking project\u2019s landing of two spacecraft on Mars in 1976. Orbiter and lander critical design reviews, spacecraft thermal and structural tests, and other hardware tests were completed during the year. Scientific satellites launched in 1973 included Explorer 49 in lunar orbit to measure galactic and solar radio noise using occultation of the moOn to reduce background interference, Explorer 50 to complete a study of the interplanetary environment over an 11-yr solar cycle, and Explorer 51 to study the earth\u2019s outer atmosphere. As December ended, scientists were studying Comet Kohoutek with optical telescopes, radiotelescopes, and radar from the ground; high-flying aircraft; and instruments on unmanned satellites, sounding rockets, and Skylab 4. Noaa 3, launched by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, would provide atmospheric soundings and very-high-resolution, day-and-night cloud-cover imaging. Two communications satellites, Intelsat-IV F\u20147 for the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization and Anik 2 Canadian domestic comsat, were successfully launched, as well as Nnss 0\u201420 Transit navigational satellite for the Navy. Erts 1, launched in mid-1972 as the first Earth Resources Technology Satellite, completed its 7000th photo-taking orbit of the earth, demonstrating the great potential of remote-sensing of the earth\u2019s resources by providing data for use throughout the world. All but one prime contractor for the space shuttle had been selected and design was proceeding on schedule. Most of the shuttle orhiter subcontractors were lined up, with fabrication to begin in FY 1975. Nine nations in the European Space Research Organization agreed to build the Spacelab for a wide variety of applications as a shuttle payload. nasa and dod made joint system studies for the space tug and tentative agreement was reached for DOD to develop an initial tug stage for the shuttle. The first two powered flights of the X\u201424B lifting body were successfully made in the NASA and Air Force hypersonic aerospacecraft research program. NASA also vigorously pursued solutions to problems of aircraft noise, pollution, safety, and operational efficiency and technology for future-generation aircraft. Flight tests of NASA\u2019s digital fly-by-wire advanced flight control system indicated the system improved handling qualities of aircraft in all flight conditions, with the reduced aircraft weight increasing payload potential and reducing fuel consumption. The JT8D engine refan program progressed to scheduling ground tests for February 1974. The engine modifications\u2014in 727, 737, and DC-9 aircraft, models that made up 60% of the domestic commercial fleet\u2014 were expected to reduce areas affected by aircraft noise by 75%. A 67% reduction in 727 aircraft landing noise was anticipated from a two-segment landing procedure being tested in the NASA and Federal Aviation Administration noise abatement program. Automobile engines were used to demonstrate an internal combustion concept for reducing pollution emissions while increasing engine efficiency for general-aviation aircraft. New flight research programs included the remotely piloted research vehicle project in which the pilot flew scale models from a ground-based cockpit, eliminating risk to the test pilot and reducing test-flight costs more than 50%. In NASA\u2019s sounding rocket program, more than 80 flights studied atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomagnetic storms, meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations; male astronomical observations in x-ray, ultraviolet, and radio regions of the electromagnetic spectrum; and supported other programs. Rocket launches provided a reference for calibration of equipment on Skylab\u2019s Apollo Telescope Mount. Forty-nine balloons were flown for scientific research and for development of new technology for long-duration orbital missions. DOD\u2019s year included further development and implementation of satellite communications and navigation systems, development of new military aircraft, and construction of advanced medium STOL prototypes. The U.S.S.R.\u2019s record 86 launches topped 83 in 1971 and 74 in 1972. The 107 Soviet payloads included 85 Cosmos satellites, 2 Intercosmos, I\tLuna, 2 Meteor, 1 Prognoz, 1 cooperative Soviet-French Oreol, 2 manned Soyuz, 1 Salyut, 4 Mars probes, and 4 Molniya I and 4 Molniya II\tcomsats. The Luna 21 probe landed the Lunokhod 2 self-propelled vehicle on the moon for lunar studies. Soyuz 12 carried two cosmonauts into orbit on a two-day mission in September, the first Soviet manned flight since 1971, and Soyuz 13 carried two cosmonauts on an eight-day mission in December. Spacecraft system tests and experiments were reported successful on both flights.

Skylab\u2019s triumph heralded the approach of the shuttle era that would weld with the earth the vast regions of near-earth space, extending man\u2019s transportation system into regions beyond land, sea, and air. The newest Pioneer probes began penetration into the mysteries of outer planetary space. Budget restrictions in line with President Nixon\u2019s January 1250-billion target for total Government spending slowed space shuttle manpower buildup, suspended work on the High Energy Astronomy Observatory, and required phase-out of communications satellite work and curtailment of work on nuclear propulsion. But Skylab, the space shuttle, the scheduled U.S.-U.S.S.R. 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission, the Viking, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, and many applications and aeronautics projects were retained in a balanced and productive program. Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for the past seven years and member of the NASA staff since October 1958, retired at the end of the year. Dr. Newell had been Science Program Coordinator in the Nation\u2019s first satellite program, the Naval Research Laboratory\u2019s Project Vanguard, before establishment of NASA. Tight funding and the near completion of the Skylab missions brought a net reduction in NASA Civil Service employees of 1646, including retirements, during the calendar year, with a total 25 598 on board Jan. 5, 1974. Headquarters employees dropped by a net change of 80, Kennedy Space Center by 117, Johnson Space Center by 110, Marshall Space Flight Center by 374, Ames Research Center by 49, Flight Research Center by 13, Langley Research Center by 62, Lewis Research Center by 494 (with the phasing down of Plum Brook Station), Goddard Space Flight Center by 289, and Wallops Station by 14. aec-nasa Space Nuclear Systems Office was closed with the end of the nerva program. Further reductions of 628\u2014including 405 at msfc and 200 at LeRC\u2014were scheduled in 1974, to bring the FY 1974 end-of-year total to the required 24 970 ceiling. Aerospace industry employment in the Nation increased to 946 000 in June but declined to 935 000 by the year\u2019s end. Techniques developed for aerospace activities were applied to earthquake prediction, development of residential solar heating, and fuelsaving integrated systems for housing. NASA added 550 technical briefs to its more than 5000 technical innovations already available for U.S, industry use. More than 68 000 U.S. industrial and commercial firms requested additional data on these innovations. Some 3000 firms spent $625 000 for special assistance from nasa\u2019s Regional Dissemination Centers; 1500 firms purchased 1891 computer programs and related documentation for $221 530. NASA liberalized its patent-licensing procedures to speed technology transfer and during 1973 five exclusive patent licenses, the largest number since the program\u2019s inception, were granted. A nasa liaison office was opened in New York City to work directly with city agencies on public safety, drug detection, and fire prevention. A rechargeable heart pacemaker was developed under nasa auspices by the Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Laboratory. Electronic components designed for space use were incorporated in the device, which could be recharged at home by the patient, eliminating the need for surgery every two years to replace conventional devices. A new radio transmitter temperature pill allowed doctors to check localized internal body temperature changes. A portable visual testing device permitted early detection of eye disorders. A test hospital room for paralyzed patients used space-developed devices for remote operation of communications systems and appliances. The nasa FY 1974 appropriation of $3,002 billion was $13.9 million below the budget request, $62.4 million below the $3.0645-billion FY 1973 authorization, and $406 million below the FY 1973 appropriation of $3,408 billion.

A significant milestone was the Intergovernmental Agreement on U.S. and European cooperation on Spacelab, signed by the U.S., Belgium, France, West Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. To be funded and developed by nine members of the European Space Research Organization, the Spacelab would be carried into orbit by NASA\u2019s space shuttle orbiter and would accommodate experiments and personnel on missions of 7 to 30 days. Notable progress was made in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, with the joint U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission on schedule for July 1975 launch. Working groups met in both countries and a November Moscow meeting familiarized eight U.S. astronauts with the Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. Docking system designs were essentially completed and all hardware construction was on schedule. Joint dynamic testing of test units began at Johnson Space Center. Flight crews were selected in both countries. Eighty-three nations entered into Definitive Agreements for intelsat, permanently establishing the global communications satellite system envisioned in the U.S. Communications Satellite Act of 1962. Scientists from other nations cooperated in nasa studies ranging from investigations of the solar system to practical applications of space technology. Erts 1 and Skylab environment and resources data were used throughout the world. Scientists from 37 countries and the United Nations participated in Erts 1 experiments and Brazil and Canada established their own erts data-acquisition facilities. Four foreign experiments were carried on Skylab missions and foreign scientists participated in the Apollo solar telescope program and in correlated astronomy sounding rocket programs. Scientists in 19 countries and the U.N. participated in 40 Skylab data-analysis investigations. German and Australian scientists were coinvestigators for Pioneer 11 experiments and French and U.K. scientists for Mariner 10. Investigators from 40 nations and esro were selected to participate in the Apollo 17 lunar sample program. A joint working group of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and nasa held the third and fourth meetings on space biology and medicine, exchanging information on manned space flight. Parallel communications channels using Intelsat and Molniya comsat systems were planned for 1974 to support the U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. Direct Communications Link, with construction of earth stations in both countries for access to each other\u2019s satellites. Work went forward for future cooperative satellite projects. Agreement was reached with Italy to fly San Marco C-2 in 1974. Negotiations were underway with West Germany for 1974 launch of the aeros-b aeronomy satellite and work continued on the experimental cts comsat to be launched with Canada, the helios solar probe with Germany, the intasat ionospheric beacon with Spain, the UK\u20145 stellar x-ray satellite, Canada\u2019s Anik C, and U.K.\u2019s X4 technology spacecraft. Negotiations were also underway on nasa launch services for the French-German Symphonic comsat in 1974 and two ESRO test comsats in 1976 and 1977. The U.S. and esro were about to enter agreement for an air traffic control and navigation satellite system. During the year nasa launched 30 sounding rockets from ranges in other countries, including rockets carrying foreign payloads or cooperative experiments. New sounding rocket agreements were signed with Australia, Brazil, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. (Pres Rpt 1974; nasa Release 73-281; NASA Activities, 1/15/74, 2-3) \u2022 A burgeoning worldwide energy shortage led President Nixon to propose in June the establishment of a Cabinet-level Dept, of Natural Resources, an Energy Research and Development Administration, and a Nuclear Energy Commission. The shortage reached crisis proportion with the embargo by Arab nations on oil shipments to the U.S. in retaliation for U.S. support to Israel during the October Arab-Israeli war. In a November speech President Nixon noted the U.S. was on the verge of \u201cthe most acute shortage of energy since World War II.\u201d He called for reduced use of heat, electricity, and gasoline; announced Federal Government steps to lower energy consumption; asked the Atomic Energy Commission to accelerate licensing and constructing nuclear power plants; and asked for an emergency energy act. Nine energy bills, passed in rapid succession by the first session of the 93rd Congress, included authorizations for mandatory fuel allocation programs, construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline, a return to year-round daylight saving time, a speed limit on interstate highways, and the National Emergency Act. Soaring prices of all kinds of fuel, long lines of cars and banned Sunday sales at gas stations, and airline fare increases and schedule cutbacks marked closing months of the year. Economists forecast a possible depression as energy shortages aggravated an already recessed economy. Scientists sought additional sources of fossil fuels and, for the future, new sources of energy to make the U.S. energy-autonomous. The focus turned to NASA and its pioneering expertise in the technologies of solar energy and development of hydrogen as a substitute for gasoline in automobiles and aircraft. At the year\u2019s end pending legislation endorsed NASA cooperation with other appropriate agencies in solving the worldwide energy shortage and in providing the U.S. with future sources of non-fossil-fuel energy.
