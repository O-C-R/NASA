One of the few programs of any size begun by the Nixon administration is a $49 million project at the National Science Foundation code-named rann\u2014for Research Applied to National Needs, rann supports a host of small programs aimed at improving things like subways, cancer treatment, earthquake forecasts and sewers.\u201d Changes within NASA required \u201clittle new money, but they serve to spotlight the emphasis the Nixon administration places on the practical goals of science. In the last six months NASA has taken on study projects from the Departments of Commerce, Interior, and Transportation\u2014 none of which involves space exploration. The space agency also has a contract from the National Science Foundation to investigate the use of solar cells (used on most unmanned spacecraft) to electrify homes and buildings.

      "story": " President Nixon announced decision U.S. should develop space shuttle system. In statement re'eased from San Clemente. Calif., following 45-min meeting with Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, President said: \u201cI have decided today that the United States should proceed at once with the development of an entirely new type of space transportation system designed to help transform the space frontier of the 1970\u2019s into familiar territory, easily accessible for human endeavor in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s. \u201cThis system will center on a space vehicle that can shuttle repeatedly from earth to orbit and hack. It will revolutionize transportation into near space, by routinizing it. It will take the astronomical costs out of astronautics. In short, it will go a long way toward delivering the rich benefits of practical space utilization and the valuable spinoffs from space efForts into the daily lives of Americans and all people. \u201cThe new year 1972 is a year of conclusion for America\u2019s current series of manned flights to the moon. Much is expected from the two remaining Apollo missions\u2014in fact, their scientific results should exceed the return from all the earlier flights together. Urns they will place a fitting capstone on this vastly successful undertaking. But they also hring us to an important decision point\u2014-a point of assessing what our space horizons are as Apollo ends, and of determining where we go from here. \u201cIn the scientific arena, the past decade of experience has taught us that spacecraft are an irreplaceable tool for learning about our near earth space environment, the moon, and the planets, besides being an important aid to our studies of the sun and stars. In utilizing space to meet needs on earth, we have seen the tremendous potential of satellites for intercontinental communications and worldwide weather forecasting. We are gaining the capability to use satellites as tools in global monitoring and management of natural /resources, in agricultural January 5; President Nixon and NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher examined a model of the reusable space shuttle at San Clemente, Calif,, following the President\u2019s announcement that the United States would proceed with shuttle development. applications, and in pollution control. We can foresee their use in guiding airliners across the oceans and in bringing televised education to wide areas of the world. \u201cHowever, all these possibilities, and countless others with direct and dramatic bearing on human betterment, can never be more than fractionally realized so long as every single trip from earth to orbit remains a matter of special effort and staggering expense. This is why commitment to the space shuttle program is the right next step for America to take, in moving out from our present beachhead in the sky to achieve a real working presence in space\u2014because the space shuttle will give us routine access to space by sharply reducing costs in dollars and preparation time.\u201d It was significant, President said, \u201cthat this major new national enterprise will engage the best efforts of thousands of highly skilled workers and hundreds of contractor firms over the next several years. The amazing \u2018technology explosion\u2019 that has swept this country in the years since we ventured into space should remind us that robust activity in the aerospace industry is healthy for every one\u2014not just in jobs and income, but in the extension of our capabilities in every direction. The continued pre-eminence of America and American industry in the aerospace field will be an important part of the shuttle\u2019s \u2018payload.\u2019 \u201d Shuttle program would \u201cgive more people access to the liberating perspectives of space, even as it extends our ability to cope with physical challenges of earth and broadens our opportunities for international cooperation in low-cost, multi-purpose space missions.\u201d President quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes: \u201cWe must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it, but we must sail, and not drift, nor lie at anchor.\u201d President concluded, \u201cSo with man\u2019s epic voyage into space\u2014a voyage the United States of America has led and still shall lead.\u201d (PD, 1/10/72, 27-8; Transcript of Fletcher, Low press conference, 1/5/72)",

      "story": " Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released statement from San Clemente, Calif., following President\u2019s announcement of decision to proceed with development of space shuttle. Decision was consistent with NASA FY 1972 budget and was \u201ca most historic step in the nation\u2019s space program\u2014it will change the nature of what man can do in space. By the end of this decade the nation will have the means of getting men and equipment to and from space routinely, on a moment\u2019s notice if necessary, and at a small fraction of today\u2019s cost. This will be done within the framework of a useful total space program of science, exploration, and applications at approximately the present overall level of the space budget.\u201d Dr. Fletcher described shuttle as \u201cairplane-like orbiter, about the size of a DC\u20149 . . . capable of carrying into orbit and back again to earth useful payloads up to 15 feet [4.6 metersl in diameter by 60 feet [18 meters] long, and weighing up to 65,000 lbs [29 500 kg]. Fuel for the orb iter\u2019s liquid-hydrogen liquid-oxygen engines will be carried in an external tank that will be jettisoned in orbit.\u201d Orbiter would be launched by unmanned booster and would operate in space for one week, during which crew could launch, service, or recover unmanned spacecraft; would perform experiments; and, in future, would resupply and restaff space modules brought to space by shuttle. He cited reasons \u201cspace shuttle is important and is the right step in manned space flight and the U.S. space program.\u201d First, \u201cthe shuttle is the only meaningful new manned space program which can be accomplished on a modest budget. Second, the space shuttle is needed to make space operations less complex and less costly. Third, the space shuttle is needed to do useful things. Fourth, the shuttle will encourage greater international participation in space flight.\u201d Dr. Fletcher said NASA and contractors would focus until late February on technical areas, including comparisons of pressure-fed liquid- and solid-fuel rocket-motor options for shuttle\u2019s booster stage, before NASA issued requests for proposals in the spring. \u201cThis summer we will place the space shuttle under contract and development work will start.\u201d At press conference in San Clemente following release of shuttle statements, Dr. Fletcher and Dr. Low discussed President\u2019s decision. Dr. Fletcher said President was \u201cparticularly anxious that I stress the international aspects of this. This program will be open to all nations of the world, and it is his hope some day that foreign visitors from all over the world will be able to participate by moving to and from space in the space shuttle.\u201d NASA anticipated that \u201cat its peak, the direct employment on the space shuttle will be of the order of 50,000 individuals. Of course, a great many of those will be employed in this area.\u201d Responding to question, Dr. Fletcher said decision on shuttle launch site, \u201cwhich will be the same as the landing site,\u201d depended on recommendation of launch site selection group. \u201cIt is not necessarily Cape Kennedy or any other site at this time.\u201d (Text: Transcript)",

The 670-page report\u2014prepared by Library of Congress under direction of Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of Science Policy Research Div.\u2014 noted that Soviet space program remained \u201ca strong and growing enterprise\u201d unhindered by budgetary strain and undimmed by deaths of three Soyuz cosmonauts in 1971. Current level of Soviet space activity exceeded that of U.S. at its peak in 1966, with perhaps 2% of Soviet gross national product devoted to space (U.S. spent about 1% of its gnp at peak). Although U.S. launch record had been declining steadily since 1966, Soviet launches had continued to climb, at least until 1970. Contrary to assertion that it was concentrating its efforts on unmanned program rather than manned program, U.S.S.R. apparently was still planning manned lunar landing and might spend $49 million on both advanced unmanned and manned lunar programs. U.S. would have committed $35 billion to total Apollo program when complete. In unmanned research satellite program \u201cthe level of activity currently runs ahead of the corresponding level of work at NASA.\u201d Compendium of every known Soviet launch that had achieved orbit showed that, along with scientific satellites, Cosmos program consisted of unmanned tests of spacecraft designed to carry cosmonauts, lunar and planetary probes that failed to leave earth orbit, unsuccessful Mars probes, and military research and development and observation satellites that accounted for 80% of Cosmos payloads. According to study, Cosmos series through April 1971 had included at least 16 tests of fractional orbital bombardment system (fobs) and 22 tests of experimental spacecraft designed to inspect and destroy other nations\u2019 observation and navigation satellites. Soviet achievements in near future were dependent on success or failure of G booster (in Saturn V class) or similar booster. Studies of moon with Luna series spacecraft would continue, perhaps with spacecraft launched by advanced booster carrying both rovers and sample returners. Planetary program would continue, probably with flyby mission to Jupiter and landing mission to Mars. Dr. Sheldon stressed that \u201cthe Soviet program is not a sham.

Foreign visitors included Soviet scientists Y. I. Belyayev, M. S. Chupakhin, and K. P. Florenskiy, who participated in conference, consulted with U.S. scientists, looked at lunar samples stored at msc, and helped select samples to return to their colleagues in U.S.S.R. NASA provided three grams (one tenth ounce) of lunar material collected on Apollo 14 mission as part of U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreements for exchange of samples. Samples included chip from widely studied crystalline rock, small piece of 9-kg (20-lb) boulder, and core samples soils, and polished thin sections. Conference papers dealt with scientific results of Apollo lunar landing missions, analysis of Soviet Luna 16 samples, and results of study of lunar surface by U.S.S.R.\u2019s Lunokhod 1. Apollo 15 Astronauts David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and Alfred M. Worden discussed their observations of lunar surface made from lunar orbit during July 26-Aug. 7, 1971, mission. Dr. N. C. Costes, Marshall Space Flight Center representative of Apollo Soil Mechanics Investigation Science Team, discussed mechanical properties of lunar soil. Washington Post later compared conference with First Lunar Science Conference in 1970, when \u201cthere were few facts available and many theories.\u201d At third conference, \u201csituation seemed to have reversed.\u201d Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of msc Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said, \u201cYou\u2019re not throwing facts out into a vacuum any more.\u201d Among facts stated at conference were: moon once had strong magnetic field, of which remnants remained to suggest moon once had metallic core up to 280 km (175 mi) thick; lunar crust was 65 km (40 mi) deep and layered; existence of extinct plutonium 244 in Apollo 14 samples indicated plutonium had been trapped when lunar crust solidified shortly after origin of solar system; and Copernicus Crater had been gouged 850 to 950 million yrs ago, making process one of more recent major lunar events. Dr. James R. Arnold of Univ. of California at San Diego reported that moon\u2019s radioactive elements were concentrated in two broad plains, Ocean of Storms and Sea of Rains. \u201cAs we go away from this region ... we drop to quite low levels of radioactivity.\u201d Scientists agreed that these radiation emissions should not prove hazardous to astronauts who might visit for short period. Dr. Isidore Adler, Goddard Space Flight Center scientist, reported that map of lunar surface chemistry produced from Apollo 15 x-ray data indicated highlands of moon contained more aluminum than did plains. Finding supported hypothesis that moon\u2019s early crust was rich in feldspar. Dr. Gary V. Latham of Columbia Univ., Apollo Program chief seismic investigator, debated presence of volcanoes on moon with Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Thomas Gold. Dr. Latham said that while main episode of lunar vulcanism seemed to have ceased 3 billion yrs ago, \u201cit\u2019s by no means certain that we do not have continuing vulcanism on a very minor scale on the moon.\u201d Dr. Gold continued to support theory that moon was dead, rigid body with basins of compacted dust. Dr. Leon T. Silver of California Institute of Technology proposed theory of \u201cparentless lead\u201d on moon to explain presence in some lunar locations of more lead than could have been produced by decay of radioactive uranium. In moon\u2019s extreme vacuum it was possible for vaporized lead to travel great distances from its parent, uranium. Dr. Silver said other materials could be distributed over lunar surface in same way, all of which could confuse analysis of moon\u2019s age. Dr. John A. Wood of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory discussed tiny piece of green glass among Apollo 14 samples that scientists had nick-named \u201cGenesis bean.\u201d Bean and other glass fragments were almost identical chemically to rare meteorites, Howardites. Evidence suggested green glass had originated on moon and not from meteorite impacts on earth and thus might be some of earliest material of solar system. Consensus of conference on bulk composition of moon was summarized by Dr. Gast: feldspar-rich highland material with anorthosite as one prevalant component, basalts (solidified lava, low in radioactive elements and relatively young) in plains and basins, and KREEP (highly radioactive material rich in potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus).

Among applications was spring Arctic ice survey, in which some 80 scientists would be on ice measuring strain rates, meteorological conditions, and ice types, supported by Convair 990 aircraft from Ames Research Center. Also microwave techniques in remote sensing could identify ice-free lanes in Great Lakes region, making possible efficient shipping much earlier in spring than at present. Soo Canal into Lake Superior, which carried more tons of freight than any other canal in world, was now open only one half of year. Weather and cloud cover made aircraft surveillance inefficient; microwave techniques from satellite altitude was more practical in this instance. Another important program would be thermal mapping by remote sensing to permit better industrial planning from knowledge of how development would actually affect environment. Land-use planning also would be greatly aided by remote sensing data processed by computerized inventory system being developed at msc.

Change followed receipt of Jan. 14 letter from Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, announcing change in NASA office name from OABT to OAST. On first day of hearings Dr. Fletcher testified on \u201csteady increase\u201d in NASA funding for aeronautics: Funding had grown from $42 million in FY 1966 to $110 million in FY 1972, \u201ca doubling in terms of constant dollars. When you add the funding for salaries and other in-house costs related to supporting the aeronautics programs, the total . . . has grown from 1.6% of the total NASA budget in fiscal year 1966 to 7.1% in fiscal year 1972.\u201d Number of NASA personnel members working in aeronautics research and technology had grown from 2600 in 1966 to 5300. Increase had occurred while NASA staff had been reduced from 34 000 to 27 500. Dr. Fletcher said joint Dept, of Transportation and NASA Study on Civil Aviation Research and Development (card) had \u201cforced the establishment of new and more effective coordination mechanisms between NASA and DOT.\u201d Mechanisms were being used \u201cto develop a formal card Policy Implementation Plan to specify clear goals, responsibilities, planned achievement milestones, and projected resource requirements for dot and NASA jointly.\u201d card policy study had caused \u201cbetter focus on the priority problem areas of aircraft noise . . . and terminal congestion\u201d and directed more specific attention to role R&D might play in developing better total operating system for low-density aviation market so that civil aviation might be used more economically as tool for regional development. Focus did not compromise \u201cability to continue a comprehensive research and technology program in all the aeronautical disciplines to provide a technology base for the future.\u201d Deputy Director Clarence A. Syvertson of Ames Research Center outlined general recommendations of CARD study: scope of civil-aviation R&D programs should be expanded to emphasize nontechnological factors; economists and social scientists should be assigned to NASA and dot staffs, r&d staffs of Dept, of Defense, NASA, dot, and Civil Aeronautics Board should be interchanged to provide broad systems background for more effective Government action in civil aviation programs. cab should explore policy of allowing intermodal mergers of airlines for expanded use of air cargo to encourage innovative industry R&D in this area. Dept, of Commerce should refine and monitor measurable indicators of U.S. progress in civil aviation industry. National Aeronautics and Space Council should review and recommend national policies guiding civil aviation that embraced several agencies. George W. Cherry, Deputy Administrator for Programs in oast, reported \u201cconsiderable ongoing activity abroad in designing, building and selling new, small economical aircraft for the world\u2019s low-density short-haul market. This raises the questions: Where will replacement aircraft come from? Can the U.S. industry compete with the foreign manufacturers to fill the market?\u201d Answers required \u201cfundamental policy decisions by the United States with regard to the desirability of providing continuing or expanded public-need air service, and also . . . to whether Government support can or should be given to the manufacturer.\u201d U.S. needed to know more about market and economics of operating in low-density area to write specifications for aircraft and operating system. \u201cIf industry designs fall short of meeting the economic specifications, there should be enough information available to determine if Government assistance . . . could result in the operator providing viable service. If subsidy is necessary, subsidizing the nonrecurring costs of manufacture, rather than the recurring costs of operation, might make good sense.\u201d NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology Roy P. Jackson described questol project plans for two quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (stol) transport research aircraft: \u201cThe experimental airplanes will function as a versatile facility for NASA flight research programs developed in cooperation with other Government agencies and interested industry groups, including the airlines. The information provided will reduce the technical risk associated with development, by industry, of both civil and military STOL transports\u201d and \u201cprovide a comprehensive technical foundation on which Government regulatory agencies can establish realistic criteria for certification of commercial subsonic stol transport aircraft and for en route and terminal area operations.\u201d (Transcript) January 19:\tNASA announced selection of flight crews for Skylab missions.

Astronaut Charles Conrad, Jr., said preparations were on schedule for April 1973 launch. Contractor checkouts and tests of hardware were expected to be completed for delivery to Kennedy Space Center in July. Skylab would carry some 20 000 pieces of stowage equipment on board to provide life support for nine men for 140 days. \u201cSo it all goes up at one time, and we\u2019ve got a great deal of work to do, not only to learn how to operate this vehicle but also all the experiments in it. It became apparent that we could not be 100 percent cross-trained as we had been in Apollo, so we\u2019ve . . . defined some areas for each guy to become expert in ... . That allowed us to balance out the training hours. Right now ... we have some 2000 training hours per man defined. We\u2019ve been working on the basic training for the past year.\u201d Training hardware would be available about February 1. Commander would have overall responsibility for mission and would be command and service module expert. Science pilot would be expert in all medical equipment and in Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) and its associated hardware. Pilot would be expert in Orbital Workshop systems and electrical systems. Remaining experiments would be divided among crewmembers according to availability and choice. Astronaut Alan L. Bean said photographic data returned from Skylab would be \u201cfar superior\u201d to previous data because actual film would be returned to earth. To return film, crews would conduct two extravehicular activities (eyas) on first mission, three on second, and two on third. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be moving . . . 240 pounds [109 kg] worth of film, in canisters, magazines, in and out of the cameras. We\u2019ll have to remove the used exposed film and replace it with new film. It\u2019s going to take about 3 hours.\u201d Experiments were described by Astronaut Gerald P. Carr. They included EREP earth resources experiment containing five sensors to calibrate earth\u2019s atmosphere, corollary experiments submitted by high school students, engineering experiments to study effects of zero g on metal alloys and flammability of certain items, habitability experiments to study noise levels and atmospheric composition, and scientific experiments. Scientific experiments would include studies of effect of zero g on single human cells, studies of circadian rhythm of pocket mice and vinegar gnats, ultraviolet stellar astronomy and x-ray astronomy. Technological experiments would include crew vehicle disturbances, manual navigation sightings, and \u201ca study of the little contamination cloud that we carry around with us . . . kind of like Pigpen in Peanuts.\u201d In response to question on illness during missions, Astronaut Joseph P. Kerwin said NASA would provide equipment and training on board to take care of most illnesses and injuries that could be handled in a doctor\u2019s office. Science pilot would be able to provide emergency care for illnesses \u201cup to and including quite severe. We have quite a package of drugs on board, administrable by all routes; we have tracheotomy equipment and equipment for maintaining an airway for stopping bleeding. We are attempting to develop in time for the flight intravenous fluids. We feel that, almost regardless of the severity of the injury, we will at least be able to stabilize the patient.\u201d (Transcript)",

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, discussed NASA plans for continuing fruitful space program in interview published by Christian Science Monitor: \u201cFor the next few years, we may have fewer of the more spectacular explorational missions .... We will focus more on . . . communications satellites, weather satellites, earth resources survey satellites.\u201d Next Applications Technology Satellite (ats) would demonstrate direct TV broadcasting in region of Rockies and Alaska, using large satellite with big antenna that could beam programs directly to augmented receivers in individual homes. Demonstration\u2014-in cooperation with Dept, of Health, Education, and Welfare\u2014would work through educational network rather than directly to homes, however. Comsats were \u201cnot quite so exciting an aspect of space technology\u201d in U.S. but, \u201cworldwide, there has been more interest in this than in almost any other aspect of our program.\u201d Interest equaled that of ERT satellite. \u201cCountries with vigorous mineral exploitation and agricultural development are interested in ERT satellites .... Countries with underdeveloped communications and education, such as India, are keenly interested in the broadcasting satellites.\u201d In weather satellite field, new sophisticated instruments \u201cgive hope that we can get a really world weather observing network going.\u201d Infrared sensors, microwave sensors, and high-resolution optics that obtained temperature profiles throughout atmosphere by looking \u201cthrough holes in cloud systems\u201d should help \u201cto get points all over the globe where we now get only pieces of the picture.\u201d NASA would try processing materials in zero g during Skylab program. \u201cIf it works with men doing it, there are cheaper ways we could do it without men. It may be one of those things that will be worth doing when we can get routine access to space with the shuttle.\u201d In response to question, Dr. Fletcher said second Skylab would be \u201ca very good thing for the country. But I\u2019m not sure the budget needed for both a Skylab and the shuttle would be salable. The shuttle is more important in the long run. Not to do more of the Skylab sort of thing will be bad for prestige. The Russians will be doing much more than we will. I\u2019m sure there will be criticism from Congress and the public.\u201d But with shuttle and current budget level, \u201cwe could do virtually all those things we have talked about doing in this century. We could go back to the moon and establish crude bases .... We could establish a permanent space station. We just might be able to send men to Mars and get them safely home.\u201d Apollo industrial base had already been destroyed, Dr. Fletcher said. \u201cWe could assemble a nucleus of people who know these things within NASA. But that\u2019s about all.\u201d As NASA turned toward space shuttle, \u201cWe hope and expect that many of the people who worked on Apollo will be in that program, so we won\u2019t lose all the basic space flight know-how.\u201d In international cooperation, France had asked to participate in Skylab mission and U.S.-U.S.S.R. meetings to establish compatible space docking system had progressed. \u201cIt looks as though we can do it technically. With existing hardware, we could do a docking in something like 1974 to 1975.\u201d Scientific community was \u201cstill debating whether it would prefer an intensive Jupiter and Saturn explorational program or some form of grand tour to other planets as well,\u201d Dr. Fletcher said. There was \u201cno slackening of interest in Grand Tour\u201d on NASA\u2019s part. (CSM, 1/22/72)",

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said budget would \u201cenable the United States space program to move forward on all fronts, on a basis consistent with realistic budgetary constraints both now and in the future.\u201d Budget \u201cfully supports President Nixon\u2019s decision to proceed with development of the space shuttle, . . . achieves this and other basic objectives in science, in applications, and in aeronautics within a fiscal \u201973 budget approximately equal to that of last year,\u201d and \u201cprovides programs to do the kind of work this agency should be doing.\u201d In past NASA had presented programs that required relatively modest outlays in first year and subsequent substantial increases. In FY 1973 budget, \u201cWe have a well-balanced program that can be supported at an essentially constant budget level over the next several years.\u201d \u201cMost important aspects\u201d of NASA\u2019s FY 1973 program were: \u201cThe decision to proceed with the space shuttle; a strong effort in space science and applications; a major increase in aeronautics; a change of scope in the outer planet exploration program; and a reorientation of our nuclear rocket program.\u201d Significant changes from FY 1972 plans were in Grand Tour and nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (nerva) programs. Grand Tour of outer planets would be replaced with less complex missions to Jupiter and perhaps Saturn. In place of nerva, NASA would concentrate on defining small, high-energy nuclear propulsion system for missions to explore planets. During 1973 and beyond, \u201cNASA will put even greater emphasis on turning the knowledge and technology acquired through space research to the immediate and lasting benefits of mankind. The recent establishment of the Office of Applications was an important step in that direction. \u201cIn aeronautics we will increase our efforts by 50 percent this year, directed mainly at the pressing domestic needs for quiet engines and quiet short-haul air transportation systems.\u201d Dr. Fletcher said nasa FY 1973 budget \u201cmaintains our manned space flight capability, contributes to national security, increases the opportunity for acquiring new scientific knowledge, encourages international cooperation, addresses the problems of society and the environment, and helps to assure continued American leadership in aeronautics.\u201d Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, discussed space shuttle funding: \u201cThe shuttle, as we now visualize it\u201d\u2014if it had pressure-fed boosters and 4.6- by 18.3-m (15- by 60-ft), 30 000-kg (65 000-lb) capacity\u2014\u201cwill cost $5.5 billion to develop. This includes two flight vehicles.\u201d Funding would \u201cspread over more than 6 years, but the bulk of the funding will be expended over a six-year time period. In addition . . . there will be an investment in facilities of about $300 million. And if more orbiters and boosters are needed for flight applications, these will cost $250 and $50 million apiece. Our current estimates for the cost per flight are $7.7 million. This is less than most of the launch vehicles we\u2019re using today.\u201d (Transcript)",

Conclusions on Skylab program were that program was within projected costs; bulk of equipment and systems were meeting design requirements in performance and reliability; and, despite some problems in procuring and integrating experiments, schedules were being met and no flight delays or significant cost increases were anticipated. Serious consideration was recommended for several options: possibility of flying backup Skylab B in 1974-1976 period; possible revisits to Skylab A after first three flights; and use of remaining Saturn IB launch vehicles in earth resources and applications flights after Skylab A program, during 1974-1978 period. Conclusions on space shuttle program were: Sufficient technology existed to undertake development of fully reusable, low-operation-cost, earth-orbital shuttle. Number of design possibilities had been studied, covering range of development costs. Regardless of design chosen, as development costs were reduced, system recurring operating costs increased. In addition to reducing cost of near-space operations by order of magnitude, shuttle offered many opportunities for increased flexibility of earth resource surveys and management, space manufacturing, and short-term rapid-response laboratory facilities.

      "story": " Brazilian Agriculture Minister Cirne Lima inaugurated new meteorological satellite tracking station in Brasilia, Brazil. Station was second built in Brazil; first was in Rio de Janeiro. (FBis-Brazil, 2/3/72, D3) February 2:\tMariner 9 news conference was held at NASA Hq. Spacecraft (launched May 31, 1971) was in 81st day in Mars orbit, had accepted 25 000 commands, and had taken about 5000 pictures. Dr. Bradford Smith of New Mexico State Univ. said wind-transported dust that had obscured early Mariner 9 photography was more widespread and occurred more frequently than generally had been supposed; substantial quantities of surface dust were displaced each Martian year by local winds that varied with season and with specific areagraphie location; and large-scale atmospheric instabilities occurred, producing hemispheric and global dust storms which were seasonal but apparently did not occur every Martian year. Storm observed by Mariner 9 had begun in late September 1971, reached its peak in late October, and had cleared slowly until mid-December. Planet was quite clear in February. Mariner .9 photos included pictures of huge volcano with base 500 km (300 mi) wide, Harold Masursky of U.S. Geological Survey told press. \u201c. . . as the storm cleared we were able to establish that the dark spots that we saw barely sticking up through at first\u201d were \u201cthe very summit of Nix Olympica. This tall mountain with a complex crater at the top and the scalloped edges and the flat, or non-raised rims indicated to us that this was probably a multiple volcanic vent. As the storm continued clearing finally we could see all the way down to the great plains at the base of the mountain. Now this is a great volcanic pile .. . twice as big as the great volcanic pile that forms the Hawaiian Islands. The Hawaiian pile is about 225 kilometers [140 miles] across and . . . about 9 kilometers [6 miles] high. It is the largest volcanic pile on the earth. It is something like 32,000 feet [9800 meters] from the floor of the Pacific to the top of the mountain.\u201d Photos also showed \u201cspectacular channel\u201d 100 km (60 mi) long with numerous side branching valleys that ended in featureless areas. Absence of vents at ends of valleys made gaseous eruption formation improbable and suggested channel might have been formed by water erosion. Highest amount of water vapor\u2014one thousandth of that in earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014above Mars\u2019 south polar cap suggested that water vapor was being released from region as cap retreated. Absence of vapor over north polar cap indicated that water vapor there was condensed in carbon dioxide and was transported by storm or by general circulation from south polar cap to north polar cap. Vapor over south polar regions was slightly less than 20 precipitable micrometers. Mariner 9 photos of Mars had provided data which conflicted with data from 1969 Mariner 7 Mars probe. From 1969 photos of heavily cratered planet experimenters had decided that Mars was \u201ca dead planet, very primordial . . . the product of the accumulation of the cosmic debris that fell in to form the planet.\u201d Mariner 9 photos showed \u201csomething very, very different indeed. ... we can see the great volcanic piles and because of the crispness of the edges and the lack of craters, we think these are geologically young . . . [and] we have a geochemically evolved planet.\u201d Comparison of 1969 and 1971 photos showed that south polar cap regions completely covered by frost in 1969 were only partially covered in 1971. During period when photographed by Mariner 9 little separations had widened and solid carbon dioxide coverage had broken up until many dark spots showed through as the ice sublimated and revealed underlying dark rocks. Dr. Charles A. Barth of Univ. of Colorado reported that Mars atmosphere was primarily carbon dioxide but also contained atomic hydrogen and atomic oxygen. \u201cThe atomic oxygen comes presumably from the photo-dissociation of carbon dioxide and the atomic hydrogen comes most probably from the photo-dissociation of water vapor.\u201d Amount of atomic hydrogen varied very little with altitude. Atomic hydrogen extended some 20 000 km (12 000 mi) from planet like a \u201cgreat big sphere of glowing hydrogen atoms with the spacecraft running around through it. Those hydrogen atoms are put there from photo-dissociating water vapor and because of the very low gravitational field of Mars, it is relatively easy for these atoms to escape. In fact, the picture that we have, is that water comes up out of the surface of Mars, goes into the lower atmosphere . . . [and] gets deposited in the polar caps; when the polar caps thaw, it is released into the atmosphere.\u201d Atomic hydrogen was escaping into upper atmosphere at rate equal to 380 cu m (100 000 gallons) of water per day.

One hundred sixteen x-ray sources had been studied. \u201cSpace\u201d science, Dr. Naugle said, was no different from research man had been doing on earth . . . since he became man: \u201cMan does love to wonder\u2014to explore and understand his environment. The ability to wonder\u2014the desire to extend one\u2019s horizon\u2014is a measure of the mental health and vigor of an individual or a society. The ability of a nation to educate its youth and provide them with the necessary tools to explore our environment, whether it be the innermost secrets of the nucleon or the outermost regions of the universe, is one measure of that Nation\u2019s vigor and its capability to better understand, and in turn guide and control, its destiny.\u201d (Transcript) * House Committee on Science and Astronautics\u2019 Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight began hearings on H.R. 12824, FY 1973 NASA authorization bill. Dale D. Myers, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, described Apollo 15 mission (July 26-Aug. 7, 1971) as \u201cmost rewarding mission so far.\u201d Mission \u201cdemonstrated the operational maturity of the [Apollo] program .... Because of its greatly increased capability for astronaut mobility, surface exploration, sample return, and orbital science, Apollo 15 added as much new data as that gathered by the three previous missions combined.\u201d Mission had marked first use of Lunar Rover and of orbital science experiments to collect lunar-wide information. \u201cThe scientific returns from lunar orbit and surface have significantly increased our accumulated knowledge of the moon and by extrapolation of the data from this vacuum-packed laboratory, knowledge of the solar system, including our earth.\u201d Upon completion of Apollo program with Apollo 17 in December, \u201cwe will have accumulated a vast treasure of lunar data. Many exciting scientific results have already been published; however, an adequate assessment of the total body of data will require scientific effort for years to come. \u201cAs Apollo draws to a close, we are concentrating our activities in earth orbit\u2014the primary field of manned space flight during this decade.\u201d Skylab was \u201cfirst step in this direction\u201d and \u201cone of the most significant benefit-oriented programs of the space age.\u201d Skylab was four times larger than Soviet Salyut spacecraft and weighed 77 180 kg (170 000 lbs) with total 344 cu m (12 150 cu ft) pressurized volume. Skylab typified variety of activities that could be accomplished in space. \u201cSeveral years ago we began to look at this total space arena in a different way. . . . While we were driving toward our goal of a manned lunar landing ... a distinction was made . . . between manned and unmanned flight programs.\u201d Distinction \u201creally does not exist\u201d in nasa\u2019s program for 1970s. \u201cThe transition is already underway in Skylab.\u201d Survey of total space activity had also led to shuttle concept. \u201cWe started with a fully reusable system . . . using winged flyback booster and orbiter stages with all fuel carried in internal tanks.\u201d Studies confirmed feasibility. Estimated development costs were close to $10 billion, but cost per flight, at $4.1 million, \u201cmade it extremely attractive.\u201d Problem was lack of funds. NASA \u201clearned that there were cost advantages in using an expendable liquid hydrogen tank for the orbiter.\u201d This became baseline with booster configuration unchanged except for modification. While process reduced development costs, expendability of tanks increased flight costs. NASA found \u201cadditional savings could be made if we placed both the hydrogen and the oxygen tanks outside the orbiter.\u201d In efforts to economize on booster development, NASA first considered \u201cflyback booster incorporating F\u20141 engines and phasing orbiter systems\u201d and later \u201cunmanned ballistic boosters.\u201d Leading candidates were recoverable and reusable pressure-fed liquid-propellant booster and booster with solid-fueled rocket motors. Contractors were completing studies, and decision would be made shortly. Mathematica report of study for NASA in May 1971 had shown shuttle with flyback manned booster was cost-effective when averaging 39 flights a year. Myers submitted new edition of report, incorporating refined data and changes in shuttle configuration, which showed shuttle cost effective with traffic as low as 30 flights per year. \u201cI believe that practically all of this country\u2019s future earth-orbital space activities will use the Shuttle\u2019s capability in exploiting the potential benefits of space and providing the taxpayer as large a return of his space investment as possible.\u201d (Transcript)",

The second major unit ... is materials which have modified these early deposits by flooding them or building up on top of them predominantly by volcanic processes.

Apollo 11 crew crossed over four hundred thousand kilometers (250,000 miles) of space to touch another planetary body. Four teams of astronauts, from Apollos 11, 12, 14 and 15 . . . have now made the epic journey and walked the lunar surface. They have returned some 176 kg (388 lbs.) of lunar rocks and soils for analysis in earth-based laboratories and have established scientific stations on the moon that are continuously transmitting scientific and engineering data back to earth.\u201d Apollo data, with information expected from continued sample analysis and lunar data analysis in the post-Apollo period, \u201csurely will be of practical value to man, even helping him to cope with current environmental problems on earth.\u201d NASA sample analysis program had \u201crequired unprecedented advancement in instrumentation and techniques to perform multiple element and isotope analyses with extreme precision on minute amounts of sample.\u201d Improved high-resolution instruments made \u201cdetailed investigations of surface features and internal structure of materials.\u201d Other related important breakthroughs had been computer hardware and software for processing and reducing large amounts of analytical data in a very short time. \u201cThese advances, in large part stimulated by NASA-funded meteorite studies, were absolutely essential, because of the scientifically unique, but limited, lunar materials. . . . these high precision research methods can now or will soon be routinely utilized in industrial processes and laboratories.\u201d They could also \u201cbe immediately applied to a variety of environmental and biomedical problems by providing the capability to check and monitor levels of pollutants and toxic elements in our atmosphere, water, and foods.\u201d Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider outlined program\u2019s progress: \u201cDuring the coming fiscal year testing and checkout will be completed and operation of Skylab will have started. Within 2 years, the first Skylab . . . will have become part of history, having contributed new knowledge in many fields.\u201d Skylab offered \u201can earth observation capability never before available\u201d to U.S. manned spacecraft. During eight-month mission, Skylab would fly over entire U.S. except Alaska, over much of Europe, all of Africa, Australia, China, and almost all of South America\u2014covering 75% of earth\u2019s surface and passing over each point every five days. By end of 1971, 288 investigations requiring Skylab data had been submitted, 249 U.S. and 39 foreign. Of these, 164 had been identified for further study. Skylab was \u201cfirst manned space flight program designed specifically to carry activities and equipment explicitly aimed at improving man\u2019s life on earth. It will contribute significantly to the increase of knowledge of pure science and is also an experimental space station; a forerunner of permanent space stations of the future.\u201d Earth-oriented sensors would test technology for synoptic surveys of many environmental and ecological systems. Solar and astronomical observations and other science experiments would expand knowledge of solar system, universe, and near-earth space. Biomedical experiments would inform how man\u2019s well-being and ability to function were affected by living in space. Harry H. Gorman, Deputy Associate Administrator for Management in Office of Manned Space Flight, testified on $305-million FY 1973 budget request for development, test, and mission operations in manned space flight research and development program: \u201cThis is the first year in which this activity is presented as a separate item. . .

Spacecraft for mission would be based on Mariners developed to explore inner planets Mars, Venus, and Mercury. They would have large antennas for longdistance communication, be powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators, carry more than 68 kg (153 lbs) of instrumentation including TV cameras, and be launched by Titan-Centaur-Burner III boosters and accelerated by Jupiter\u2019s gravity and orbital velocity for flight to Saturn. Possible Saturn encounters included flying close to planet\u2019s satellite Titan\u2014larger than planet Mercury and only satellite known to have atmosphere. Spacecraft would encounter Jupiter in about IV2 yrs and Saturn about 3% yrs after launch. Mission plan flexibility would permit selection of different flyby trajectory at Saturn for second spacecraft based on data from first. Plan would maintain option to use Pioneer-class spacecraft for Jupiter and Saturn orbiters in late 1970s. Project responsibility had been assigned to Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In other testimony, Dr. Naugle said NASA had developed heat sterilization techniques for Viking lander and new thermoradiation techniques expected to have future space and industrial applications.

Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology Roy P. Jackson reported \u201cexcellent results\u201d in first acoustic tests, completed in November 1971, of experimental quiet engine for conventional takeoff and landing (ctol) aircraft. \u201cIn an unsuppressed baseline configuration . . . the noise levels were the equivalent of at least 3 EPNdB [epndb, effective perceived noise in decibels] lower than the original targets. In a first cut simulation of an acoustically suppressed nacelle which was not an optimum design, the noise levels were from 7 to 9 EPNdB lower yet, with aerodynamic performance losses no greater than expected.\u201d It appeared possible to design an advanced version of ctol engine \u201cwhich will incorporate all the advances in technology and will have a more nearly optimum trade-off between noise reduction and installed weight penalty.\u201d In FY 1973, $2.5 million was requested for program to reduce noise of short takeoff and landing (stol) aircraft to 95 epndb at 500 ft (150 m). Tests at Flight Research Center of quieted T-34 high-bypass-ratio engine operating with simulated wing-flap system would develop design data for both quiet, experimental stol (questol) aircraft program and quiet, clean, STOL experimental engine program. Vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (vtol) noise reduction program, with budget request of $2.5 million, focused on lift fans with additional work on helicopter rotor noise. Acoustic and aerodynamic data would continue to be developed in tests at Langley, Ames, and Lewis Research Centers. George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs in Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (oast), described NASA role in Joint nasa, Federal Aviation Administration, and Dept, of Defense microwave landing system (mls) development plan to provide landing system for civil and military use to replace current very-high-frequency (vhf) landing system. NASA would provide personnel in faa mls Project Office, chairmanship of the mls Interagency Advisory Group, flight-test validation of the mls for stol operations, and extension of our work in FY 1973 to include ctol and vtol aircraft. \u201cWe are convinced the national microwave landing system program will make significant contributions toward noise abatement, airport congestion relief, and, especially, safety enhancement in the airport area.\u201d Gerald G. Kayten, Director of Transport Experimental Program Office in oast, said on Feb. 23 that NASA programs would \u201cprovide a foundation upon which industry can base the design and development of the new stol systems in the late 1970\u2019s, and upon which the Government can establish criteria for certification and regulation of such systems.\u201d Programs also would enable Government to make 1976 decision on vertical short takeoff and landing (v/stol) incorporation recommended in Dept, of Transportation Northeast Corridor Report. \u201cNASA\u2019s main focus is on propulsive-lift technology for effective and economical STOL capability, engine technology for development of quiet and clean STOL propulsion systems, and airborne STOL avionics and system technology.\u201d Technology represented \u201ctotally new capability based on major advances in each of several technical disciplines.\u201d Albert J.

Meeting included interim report of NASA supercritical wing flight-test program and report on evolution of F-8 supercritical wing configuration. Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb, head of 8-Foot Tunnels Branch at Langley Research Center and developer of supercritical wing concept, commented on correlation of wind-tunnel and flight-test results. Flight tests of nasa supercritical wing on TF-8A aircraft had demonstrated that new airfoil shape increased flight efficiency at speeds near mach 1. Since its first flight March 9, 1971, TF-8A had carried supercritical wing on 27 flights and had reached mach 1.2 (1274 km per hr; 792 mph) and 15 500-km (51 000-ft) altitude, nasa test pilot Thomas C. McMurtry said flight-test program had indicated that piloting procedures and tasks at near-sonic cruise speeds should be as routine as present jet transport operations and that introduction of supercritical wing was not expected to cause any serious problems. Future plans for supercritical wing included addition of side fairings for increased area ruling, determination by simulation of effects of wing roughness from manufacturing imperfections, and development of plans for follow-on flight programs to further the readiness of new technology for industry applications, (frc Release 2\u201472; frc X\u2014Press, 2/18/72, 2)",

Tischler, Director of Shuttle Technologies Office in NASA Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (oast), testified on progress of shuttle transportation system before House Committee on Science and Astronautics\u2019 Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology during NASA FY 1973 authorization hearings: \u201cMethods for rapidly assessing the aero-heating and flight handling characteristics of the shuttle are being developed. A base for applying new design methods and for use of new materials in the sensitive problem of structural mass has been laid. Thermal protection systems, some comprising materials which were virtually unknown at the start of the program, will be brought to . . . technological readiness. The questions of long-lived propulsive and power equipment, suitable for repeated re-use, will be answered.\u201d Computerized index and search procedure for access to all published shuttle technology was nearing completion. \u201cWhile technology issues remain, the continuing progress of the technology program conducted by . . . NASA centers and industrial contractors is building a technological base that is far deeper and stronger than that which has heretofore underlain new development programs. This base . . . will assure successful Shuttle development.\u201d David S. Gabriel, Manager of aec-nasa Space Nuclear Systems Office, described NASA-funded electrophysics research program conducted by Ames, Langley, and Lewis Research Centers and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Program was concerned \u201cwith understanding and, ultimately, using electrons, nuclei, atoms and molecules. Such work is of central importance to future sciences, for example, to laser beam generation, transmission and conversion; superconductivity; or plasma power devices.\u201d In FY 1972, research had been completed on continuous-flow plasma accelerator to simulate spacecraft reentry conditions accurately, new contributions to understanding plasma turbulence had been made, knowledge of uranium plasma properties had been improved, and carbon monoxide lasers had been demonstrated to be highly efficient. New superconductor made up of thin films of vanadium and silicon had been discovered. For FY 1973 $3.4 million had been requested for programs in plasma dynamics, lasers, superconductivity, and nuclear physics. Roy P. Jackson, Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology, testified that \u201cclearly the space shuttle orbiter, a rather sophisticated piece of machinery, is not only a launch vehicle and a spacecraft but also a high speed airplane, with all the attendant considerations of aircraft-type control and landing. It offers NASA an opportunity to apply aerodynamic, structural, and materials technology that has been developing over the past 10 or 15 years for high performance aircraft. Reciprocally the shuttle work offers much to benefit aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years.\u201d NASA had also capitalized on early Air Force technology oriented toward manned high-speed flight in the atmosphere as well as reentry into the atmosphere, such as Dyna-Soar and X-15 projects. Francis J. Sullivan\u2014Director of Guidance, Control, and Information Systems in oast\u2014testified on nuclear electric power system research for spacecraft: Nuclear electric power systems offered \u201cattractive alternatives\u201d to batteries for long-life orbiting systems, \u201cin terms of minimizing structural constraints and the economic considerations of supplying several kilowatts of power. Current research is directed primarily toward two types of nuclear systems, isotope systems for low power levels of about 1 kilowatt, and the intermediate reactor power systems for levels in the range of several kilowatts up to 10-20 kilowatts.\u201d Isotope systems were radioisotope thermoelectric generators (rtgs). Intermediate reactor power system consisted of zirconium hydride reactor to generate heat and thermoelectric power-conversion components to convert this heat into electricity. Program was directed toward reactor test in 1976-1977 period to demonstrate long-life capability. Stable performance had been achieved on thermoelectric converter test modules. Effort in FY 1973 would concentrate on verifying this performance. Conversion system would be developed for testing with the reactor to verify the integrated system performance. (Transcript)",

It would return first closeup images of Jupiter and make first measurements of Jupiter\u2019s twilight side, never seen from earth. Two additional experiments\u2014celestial mechanics and S-band occultation\u2014would use communication signal and earth-based equipment. Pioneer 10 would be first spacecraft to observe Asteroid Belt between orbits of Mars and Jupiter, first man-made object to escape solar system, first spacecraft to use orbital velocity and gravity of Jupiter for escape, and first NASA spacecraft powered entirely by nuclear energy\u2014 four radioisotope thermoelectric generators developed by Atomic Energy Commission. Pioneer 10 would make 20 kinds of measurements of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, radiation belts, heat balance, magnetic field, moons, and other phenomena. It would also characterize solar atmosphere, interstellar gas, cosmic rays, asteroids, and meteoroids. Spacecraft also carried pictorial plaque designed to show scientifically educated inhabitants of another star system\u2014who might intercept it millions of years later\u2014-the time spacecraft was launched, from where, and by whom. Plaque design was etched into gold-anodized aluminum plate 15 by 23 cm (6 by 9 in) and 1.27 mm (0.05 in) thick attached to spacecraft\u2019s antenna support struts. Radiating lines on left of plaque represented positions of 14 pulsars, with mathematical binary code \u201c1-\u201d symbols representing pulsars\u2019 frequencies relative to hydrogen atom, which was used as \u201cuniversal clock.\u201d Hydrogen atom was also used as \u201cuniversal yardstick\u201d for sizing human figures and outline of spacecraft on right of plaque. Man\u2019s hand was raised in good-will gesture. Across bottom of plaque were planets ranging outward from sun, with spacecraft\u2019s trajectory arching away from earth, passing Mars, and swinging past Jupiter.\tInitial orientation of Pioneer 10 was achieved six hours after launch so that communications high-gain antenna was directed toward earth. By March 3, four scientific instruments\u2014magnetometer, charged particles experiment, geiger tube telescope, and meteoroid detector\u2014had been turned on. First midcourse maneuver, March 7, increased velocity by 11 m per sec (45.9 fps), adjusted trajectory, and shortened flight time to Jupiter by nine hours. At 3:00 pm EST March 8, Pioneer 10 was 4 570 000 km (2 840 000 mi) from earth traveling at 32 800 km per hr (20 400 mph). Round-trip radio communication time was 31 sec. By March 10 trapped radiation detector and ultraviolet photometer had been turned on and meteoroid detector had recorded several hits. Second midcourse maneuver, with two brief thruster firings March 23 and 24, delayed arrival time by 2% hrs and moved arrival point at Jupiter about 6400 km (4000 mi) closer to planet. Maneuver was also attempt to fly Pioneer 10 behind Jupiter\u2019s moon Io. Whether flight path behind Io had been achieved would not be known until spacecraft neared Jupiter. To go behind Io, spacecraft had to arrive within period of less then eight minutes. By March 24 remaining instruments\u2014plasma analyzer, cosmic ray telescope, imaging photopolarimeter, infrared radiometer, and asteroid/meteoroid detector\u2014had been turned on and all experiments were recording good data. Meteoroid detector had recorded 10 impacts, and asteroid/meteoroid telescope had seen one meteoroid. Spacecraft was expected to enter Asteroid Belt in early July and to reach Jupiter Dec. 3, 1973.

Spacecraft had exceeded mission objectives. All 12 scientific instruments were operational and were still acquiring detailed information on latitudinal and diurnal variations of ionosphere. Spacecraft was obtaining radio-sounder and correlative direct measurements to allow continuation and extension of ionospheric studies during period of declining solar activity, and long lifetime was anticipated. Isis 2 was fourth and final mission in U.S.-Canadian program to study ionosphere that began with launch of Alouette 1 Sept. 28, 1962. All four spacecraft were operational and were providing useful data. ISIS program had acquired wealth of knowledge on worldwide morphology of topside ionosphere, virtually unknown region before Alouette-isis program, and in discoveries in plasma physics and radio-wave propagation.

William H. Woodward, Director of Space Propulsion and Power, cited importance of isotope power systems to NASA planetary program: \u201cThe ability of nuclear electric power systems to operate for long periods . . . without consideration to distance from the sun is the primary feature which makes nuclear systems mandatory for outer planet missions. This self-contained energy input characteristic also provides a relative insensitivity to the operating environments encountered and this capability may be important on many missions, e.g., lander missions on planetary surfaces or missions which encounter high natural radiation fields.\u201d Power requirements of most missions could be satisfied with low-level isotope power systems using radioisotope thermoelectric generators (rtgs). \u201cCurrently, rtg\u2019s are scheduled for flight on the Pioneer Jupiter Flyby and the Mars Viking Lander missions and in addition, are planned for use in future outer planet programs.\u201d Associate Administrator for oast Roy P. Jackson testified that solar energy could prove important energy resource. National Science Foundation\u2019s rann (Research Applicable to National Needs) program had budgeted $4 million for solar energy investigations in FY 1973. Atomic Energy Commission, Dept, of Interior, and NASA were conducting inhouse studies. Solar Energy Subcommittee had been established by Federal Council on Science and Technology Committee on Energy Research and Development Goals to assess benefits to recommend r&d funds and programs. Subcommittee was first time solar energy had been considered at this level of national planning. NASA was evaluating concept for generating electric power from solar cells in space and transmitting power to earth via microwave beam, which would deliver more concentrated solar energy than naturally received on earth\u2019s surface. Collecting in space also could be continuous, rather than having to stop at night or in cloudy weather. Edwin C. Kilgore, Deputy Associate Administrator for Management, described oast manpower problems and methods to alleviate them. Though oast manpower applied to aeronautics had increased 90% since 1966, manpower for all other efforts had decreased by 56%. Growth in aeronautics could not be provided continuously by transferring personnel from space projects. \u201cIn the short term we will continue to meet the increased need for aeronautics manpower by retraining and reassignment of personnel at the Research Centers. For the Ions: term we have initiated a program to encourage the training of students interested in aeronautical sciences. ... we are continuing the cooperative NASA/university graduate research and study program begun in FY 1971 where faculty and students are working with the Research Centers.\u201d R.\tD.

Run-out costs to complete program as planned would have risen to $3.7 billion in FY 1973 and $3.95 billion in FY 1974. Revised program estimated run-out costs at $3.37 billion in FY 1974, $3.3 billion in FY 1975, $3.2 billion in FY 1976, and $3.1 billion in FY 1977.

Shuttle now planned would cost $5.5 billion, about half what configuration envisaged year before would have cost. Second significant change was cutback in planned program for exploration of outer planets, reducing plans to explore all five outer planets on Grand Tour missions in late 1970s to new focus on Jupiter and perhaps Saturn, with less expensive spacecraft. Third significant change was termination of nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (nerva) program, now including in budget request $8.5 million for defining with Atomic Energy Commission smaller nuclear rocket engine and making trade-off studies of preferred propulsion system for missions to distant planets some time in 1980s.

Magruder, adviser to President Nixon on technology, in speech before National Security Industrial Assn, in Washington, D.C.: \u201cNature of the development base applicability of military programs to civil transports has been altered drastically since the propeller transports and early jets. Those civil transports enjoyed literally \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 engines, tires, brakes, instruments, hydraulic, electrical and air conditioning systems and nearly exact aerodynamics and controls. The cost of a civil transport development project under those conditions was about one time the manufacturers\u2019 net worth, or about $300 million. During this period, it was not unusual for the military to be developing as many as one or two dozen related bombers and transports of equal size and technology. Today, a single civil air transport development program, such as the B-747, DC-10 or L-1011, will cost about five times the net worth of the manufacturers, or nearly $1.5 billion. At the same time, the Defense Department has only the C-5A, F\u201414, F-15 and B-1A in development, with little direct . . . fallout into the civil programs. \u201cSimultaneously with the skyrocketing of civil transport development costs, foreign nations have noticed that it takes a family of transports to dominate the marketplace. Where the U.S. offered twenty or thirty different models and captured 85% of the civil transport market, we now are isolated to the trijets and the B-747, while Europe offers Concordes, A-300 airbuses, Mercures for short range; VFW-614s and Falcon 20Ts for commuter traffic; and have started their stol projects for urban traffic. To do this, they have used multinational treasuries for subsidized financing.\u201d (Text)",

In Skylab \u201cwe are going to have some evas and some of these bacteria, fungi, are on the suit before they go out.

(Transcript) In second briefing, Dr. Charles A. Berry, NASA Director of Life Sciences, explained medical problems and procedures on Apollo 15 and changes for Apollo 16. Major concerns on Apollo 15 were cardiac arrhythmia\u2014irregular heart rhythm\u2014and fluid-electrolyte imbalance, with severe loss of potassium. Cardiac arrhythmia occurred occasionally in normal persons and frequently in college students, apparently as a result of fatigue from all-night studying, adrenalin increase from apprehension about grades, drug effect from drinking coffee to stay awake, and heavy workload. Fatigue, adrenalin increase, drug effect, and heavy workload also acted on astronauts. Fluid-electrolyte imbalance was dependent upon intake in food and drink and output in breath, sweat, and body wastes. In space, balance was affected by weightlessness, acceleration, 100%-oxygen atmosphere, abnormal work-rest cycle, and sustained work loads. Countermeasures that could be taken were better control of intake, supplementing electrolytes with intravenous fluids, coordinating exercise, providing lower body negative pressure, and optimizing work-rest cycles. Medical objectives for Apollo 16 were essentially same as for Apollo 15: to ensure crew safety medically, to improve probability of mission success by providing necessary medical information, and to detect and understand changes incident to space flight and learn more about effects of space flight on man. To improve medical wellbeing of Apollo 16 astronauts, 72-hr preflight controlled-diet period would determine amount of potassium needed by each crew member. Since potassium could not be preloaded, small amounts of extra potassium would be given in daily diet in flight to ensure adequacy. In addition to regular preflight cardiovascular examination, x-rays of astronauts\u2019 hearts would be taken before and after mission to determine whether heart size decreased during flight. Skylab equipment would be used in flight for electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electro-oculogram. Other inflight medical changes were daily sample of improved electrocardiogram data, option to alter bioharness wearing schedule, expansion of crew status report, high-potassium diets with potassium-enriched beverages and snack supplements, measurement of food and fluid intake and urine and fecal output, return to earth of urine and fecal samples for analysis, and provision of anti-arrhythmic drugs lidocaine, procainamide, and atropine. Dr. Berry also announced that Astronaut Donald K. Slayton, who had been removed from Aurora 7 mission (May 24, 1962) and NASA flight status 10 yrs ago because of possible heart malfunction, had been returned to NASA and Federal Aviation Administration flight status. Evidence of atrial fibrillation found in 1959 and treated until 1969 had disappeared and tests completed recently had shown \u201cperfectly normal cardiac function and cardiac anatomy.\u201d First space flight for which Slayton could be eligible would be proposed joint mission with U.S.S.R.

Several phenomena which they uncovered are now under study. Our unmanned nearby observation of Mars is similarly valuable and significant for the advancement of science. During 1971, we gave added emphasis to aeronautics activities which contribute substantially to improved travel conditions, safety and security, and we gained increasing recognition that space and aeronautical research serves in many ways to keep us in the forefront of man\u2019s technological achievements.

Dr. Fletcher said: \u201cI regard the fiscal year 1973 budget . . . as marking the end of a difficult transition period for NASA. For the past 2 or 3 years, NASA, the executive branch, and the Congress have been grappling with questions on the course the Nation\u2019s space program should take in the 1970\u2019s and beyond. The main goals in science, exploration, and applications, and the advanced system and technology required to achieve these goals, have been identified . . . and generally approved .... But there has remained a basic uncertainty . . . the question of cost. Can the Nation afford the space program of the 1970\u2019s? Will the approval of the Space Shuttle and the other programs . . . commit the Nation to a large increase in future spending levels? \u201cThis year we can give clear answers to these questions. We can assure the committee, the Congress, and the public that the program we are proposing does not commit the country to higher budget levels in future years, at least measured in current dollars .... The revised plan is, I believe, more realistic and will give the Nation a good, viable, and balanced program in aeronautics and space at a cost it can afford.\u201d Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, reported substantial progress in two basic cooperative activities with U.S.S.R.\u2014joint work on compatible docking systems and exchanges in scientific areas, including lunar sample exchanges. In response to question, Dr. Low said he thought it likely U.S.S.R. would continue lunar program after U.S. completed Apollo program. \u201cThey may even try to land men on the moon in the latter part of this decade. That will be a catching-up process.\u201d To further question, Dr. Fletcher said that in late 1970s U.S.S.R. would be \u201cdoing things in the manned space program that are beyond what we would be able to do.\u201d From end of Skylab in 1973 until 1978, \u201cit is likely that they will be carrying on some important activity and we will have no opportunity to respond until 1978\u201d [with space shuttle]. Richard C. McCurdy, Associate Administrator for Organization and Management, submitted statement on NASA\u2019s work force: \u201cWhen several reductions are made serially, as they have been in NASA over the past several years, the effects compound, and the healing processes, such as the resumption of hiring of younger people, the filling of vacancies via merit promotion ... do not have an opportunity to function.\u201d NASA was \u201cfeeling these disadvantageous effects severely.\u201d Most worrying was \u201cdwindling of the supply of new blood.\u201d It was obvious \u201ctrend cannot continue without the health and vigor of the organization being undermined.\u201d NASA needed \u201cto embark upon a period of stability\u201d in work force to \u201creturn to normal personnel development practices, heal the damage of the past several years, and be prepared to meet the challenges of the 70\u2019s.\u201d With the \u201cprospect of a period of relative stability in the general level of spending\u201d and \u201cclearer view of the NASA forward mission,\u201d such a policy was indicated. Statement submitted by Daniel J.

The Centers also serve university faculty and students; varied national, state, and local organizations; and governmental entities at all levels.\u201d NASA RDCs had served more than 2000 organizations in 1971, of which over 48% of industrial users were small businesses. m/g Robert H. Curtin (usaf, Ret.), NASA Director of Facilities, submitted statement on facilities. In $77.3-million FY 1973 request for construction of facilities, $27.9 million was for modifications and additions to facilities for space shuttle, $11.2 million for facilities supporting scientific investigations in space, $12.9 million for facilities supporting aeronautical research and technology, and $25.3 million for smaller supporting activities and planning and design.

NASA had planned to achieve 1973 ceiling by normal attrition, but rate of attrition was running 22% lower than required and Center directors had been instructed to use reduction-in-force procedures as necessary to reach ceilings. Deputy Associate Administrator for Organization and Management Bernard Moritz testified that under FY 1973 authorization bill all NASA facility projects would be presented for approval and funding under full disclosure concept. m/g Robert H. Curtin (usaf, Ret.), Director of Facilities in Office of Administration, entered prepared statement detailing $77.3-million FY 1973 request for construction of facilities and explained $8 million request for facility planning and design within that total.

Of the $4.5, $3.75 million was for space shuttle facilities, including preliminary engineering reports for larger 1974 and 1975 programs. Second portion was for large aeronautical facility \u2014$750 000 for design of full-scale subsonic wind tunnel that would ultimately cost $150 million to $200 million if approved, with total design cost of $7 million to $10 million.

Cherry described FY 1973 disbursements for aeronautics: Important part dealt with reduction of jet aircraft noise, with $28.5 million requested for research and technology to continue this work. Roughly one half was for research and technology attacking noise generation and noise propagation; $12.4 million'was for programs for near-term relief from jet aircraft noise. Of the $12.4 million, $9 million was requested for engine-modification development program and $3.4 million for development of operational procedures for noise abatement.

Guide for visit arranged by Soviet Novosti News Agency was Soyuz Cosmonaut Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training. Shatalov said U.S.S.R. did not announce space mission dates \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want to bind the people who are preparing the flight.\u201d Cosmonaut flight training areas were closed to most visitors \u201cbecause we just don\u2019t want journalists to interfere with the working atmosphere of the cosmonauts.\u201d Area contained medical center with centrifuge that cosmonauts called \u201cDevil\u2019s merry-go-round.\u201d From size and number of apartment buildings, Wilford estimated Star City population at 1500 to 2000, City was \u201csmaller than Houston space center because it does not also serve as the mission control complex and apparently has no primary responsibility for the management of spacecraft design and development.\u201d Like NASA Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston, Star City contained facilities for premission training of cosmonauts and postmission physical examinations and recreation. Like U.S. astronauts, Soviet cosmonauts were trained in aircraft \u201cthat make deep dives to simulate weightlessness.\u201d Parachuting tested ability to handle high-stress situations. First simulator for Salyut orbiting laboratory was being installed in new building to be completed at year\u2019s end. Wilford said that \u201cthis could mean that no major advance beyond the present version of Salyut should be expected until well after the simulator is ready.\u201d Of about 50 cosmonauts in Soviet space program, one third were civil engineers living in Moscow, Shatalov said; remainder were Soviet air force pilots who lived in Star City. No women were preparing for space missions but U.S.S.R. had \u201cmany women who specialize in meteorology and medicine, which are professions necessary on the orbital stations.\u201d From descriptions by Shatalov and Cosmonaut-engineer Aleksey S. Yeliseyev, Wilford had constructed outline of preparations for Soviet space mission: Cosmonauts were assigned to mission one year in advance of launch date by commission of medical and engineering experts and Shatalov. There were two backup crews. After learning spacecraft mechanics and electronics and practicing in spacecraft simulator at Star City, crew went to Baykonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan three weeks before launch. There they completed training in actual spacecraft, checked instruments, stocked food, adjusted couches, and recommended minor changes in housekeeping. \u201cUnlike Cape Kennedy,\u201d Baykonur had no simulators for last-minute practice. For two days before launch, \u201cafter the state commission approves the spaceship\u2019s readiness,\u201d crew relaxed. On launch morning cosmonauts were examined physically and biomedical sensors were attached to their bodies before they donned spacesuits. Traditionally, cosmonauts then gathered in quarters for few moments of silence broken by shouts of \u201coff we go!\u201d They signed their names on door before leaving for launch pad. Between missions, cosmonauts were expected to devote time each month to \u201csocial work\u201d\u2014visits to schools, collective farms, and factories. Shatalov had suggested that new Soviet manned missions were possible within months and that U.S.S.R. was studying mission longevity in preparation for earth-orbiting laboratories. Of next Salyut mission, Shatalov said: \u201cWe are going to make it better .... We will prolong the visits of men, and the number of expeditions will grow. This is the difference now between our program and yours.\u201d Yeliseyev had said his countrymen would \u201cprobably\u201d be on the moon by 1975. At tour\u2019s completion, Shatalov had offered toast: \u201cTo cooperation between our peoples, to working together in space, which is our future and the future of the world.\u201d (Wilford, NYT, 3/22/72, 30 ; 3/26/72, 7; Huntsville Times, 4/2/72, 17)",

Of safety funds, $3.8 million was for technology to modify civil aircraft to use Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s new microwave landing system by 1978, $700 000 for turbulence research, and $3 million for research on aircraft collision avoidance. Bill increased NASA budget request for technology utilization from $4 million to $5.5 million. Of increase, $1.2 million was to be spent in applying NASA technology to problems in urban structures, fire safety, transportation systems, and energy conversion and $300 000 for applications engineering products and patent licensing. Committee deleted $4 million from $59.6-million NASA request for High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) and restored $4 million deleted by Office of Management and Budget for Earth Observation Satellite (eos), follow-on development to Earth Resources Technology Satellite (erts).

I think flying into space in a shuttle will be just like being a passenger in an airliner, only smoother.\u201d Dr. von Braun foresaw use of shuttle for travel to Mars \u201cprobably around 1990, or at least before the end of the 20th Century.\u201d Flight probably would begin with Mars spacecraft being hauled, piece by piece, in space shuttle cargo bays, to be assembled in orbit. \u201cI think the only way to fly to Mars is with nuclear power, and because we would never want to ignite a nuclear rock on earth, we\u2019ll have to begin the journey from orbit.\u201d Dr. von Braun saw shuttle preparing way for manned exploration by ferrying small, unmanned spacecraft into orbit and launching them toward Mars in late 1970s and 1980s.

Pennino, Public Affairs Officer in Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (oast), at NASA Hq. press briefing. Research had shown aircraft noise could be reduced if pilot flew aircraft \u201cso that it climbs quickly\u201d to be \u201cas far from a ground observer as possible.\u201d When wing flaps were retracted as aircraft accelerated, aircraft required \u201cless thrust to climb. When a safe altitude is reached, the pilot can reduce the engine thrust from that required for takeoff to the lower thrust required for climb.\u201d NASA and Federal Aviation Administration were encouraging airlines to adopt two-segment approach to reduce landing noise. Pilot would adjust controls to descent first at 6° glide slope. About one mile from the runway he would change path to slope. In final stages there would be no difference in the landing procedure. Aircraft would approach with engine power somewhat reduced and would be at higher altitude. Noise reduction would be three to five effective perceived noise in decibels (epndb) one nautical mile from the end of the runway and even greater reduction farther out from the runway. Ames and Langley Research Centers were studying requirements to make two-segment approach safe standard procedure. In Lewis Research Center Quiet Engine Program, experimental engines suitable for conventional takeoff and landing aircraft were being built. Test had shown reduction of noise by using quiet engine with and without acoustically treated nacelle. Goal chosen for short takeoff and landing (stol) aircraft was 95 epndb at 152 m (500 ft). \u201cWe don\u2019t have an engine that can do that job right now, but NASA is working on it.\u201d Follow-on programs for new family of aircraft were described by James 0.

Dr. Fletcher and Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, demonstrated model of space shuttle and explained configuration and costs. Dr. Fletcher said that in halving cost of original plans main sacrifice was that \u201cwe are not reusing all the parts. We use this expendable gas tank to supply the orbiter. . . . That, however, had an enormous effect on the size. We were able to bring the size of the orbiter down so that we were able to use solid fuel rockets.\u201d Dr. Low added, \u201cWe sacrificed nothing in terms of what kinds of satellites, what kinds of payloads we can put into orbit.\u201d Estimates of larger costs by shuttle opponents had been derived by adding in cost of \u201call the satellites it will carry, the weather satellites, the communications satellites, and all of those things that would be carried anyway, whether there is a Shuttle or not,\u201d Dr. Low said. \u201cAnd this could be likened to charging to the cost of a freight train the cost also of all of the freight that it is going to carry.\u201d In reply to question on cooperation with U.S.S.R., Dr. Low cited decision to build docking and rendezvous systems compatible between U.S. and U.S.S.R. manned spacecraft. Shuttle \u201cwill have a system on it so it can attach to another satellite and we will make that system so it is the same as the Russians will use on their satellites, so that if we need to rescue each other ... or if we want to conduct joint experiments in space, we can do that.\u201d Queried on comparison of U.S. and U.S.S.R. space programs, Dr. Fletcher said, \u201cIt is quite apparent that over the last 3 or 4 years, the Soviet space effort has grown in dollar volume and in number of launches per year, during the period that ours has declined. So that . . . they are spending quite a bit more in space than we are. It is estimated that perhaps 2 percent of their gross national product is spent for space, whereas a half of a percent of our GNP is spent on space. . . . Our number of launches per year has steadily declined from a peak of something [like] almost 80 in 1966, down to . . . the order of 30 or 35 in 1970 and 1971; whereas, the number of their launches has steadily climbed . . . and is now higher than even our peak.

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in Washington, D.C. ksc site would be used for research and development launches, to begin in 1978, and for all operational flights into easterly orbits. NASA would provide facilities for shuttle users at ksc by modification of existing facilities. Vandenberg afb site would be phased in toward end of decade for shuttle flights requiring high-inclination orbits. Dept, of Defense would provide basic shuttle facilities. NASA Site Review Board studies had shown Kennedy-Vandenberg combination had cost, operational, and safety advantages over all other U.S. sites. Cost of establishing facilities at ksc was estimated at $150 million; at Vandenberg, $500 million. Decision to use KSC was \u201cmost gratifying to NASA\u2019s launch organization\u201d and ensured \u201ccontinued utilization of this base and the supporting Eastern Test Range,\u201d Dr. Kurt H. Debus, ksc Director, said in statement read at KSC press briefing following announcement of shuttle site selection. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, explained at ksc briefing why site construction at Vandenberg AFB would cost more than at ksc : \u201cAt Kennedv we can make full use of the Saturn V launch complex\u2014Complex 39. The Shuttle will be brought back in there after flight, . . . refurbished there, . . . mated with its booster ... in the vab [Vehicle Assembly Building], taken on the trawler transporter to the existing launch pad and launched.\u201d ksc modifications would be minor but at Vandenberg \u201claunch facilities . . . are not yet as well suited to the shuttle.\u201d Larger modifications would be required, \u201cand this is where the cost is.\u201d Selection between KSC and Vandenberg for a particular launch would depend on required launch azimuth, Dr. Low said. \u201cIf we launched something toward the east . . . then it makes sense to launch it from the east coast, whether it is for the Department of Defense or for NASA or for civilian users. When you launch into a polar orbit, or a high-inclination orbit, then it makes more sense to launch from the west coast so you don\u2019t overfly land.\u201d In response to question, Dr. Low said NASA did not plan to mate Air Force-supplied booster with shuttle, \u201cnasa will develop, or have developed under NASA contract by industry, the full shuttle including the orbiter, its large tanks, and the solid rocket motor.\u201d NASA did have \u201cclear understanding\u201d with dod that it would use shuttle when it became available and if it met requirements.

Total start weight of spacecraft \u201cmust be two or three orders of magnitude larger than the payload.\u201d By plasma ejection, \u201cone can easily reach exhaust velocities of several tens of kilometers per second\u201d so that \u201cthe ejected mass may be of the same order of magnitude as the payload and the efficiency very high.\u201d Energy for launch could be supplied from solar wind, tapping voltage of 1000 v if transfer resistance between ends of conductors and solar wind could be \u201cmade small.\u201d Or energy could be supplied by transfer from ground through plasma channel in atmosphere. \u201cWhen Apollo 12 was launched, there were low clouds but no thunderstorm. When the spacecraft had disappeared in the clouds, lightning was observed . . . where the spacecraft had last been seen.

Displays included moon rock and Apollo spacesuit. Television set was available for visitors to watch Apollo 16 launch on April 16. (Wallops Release 72-5) Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with 175.9km (109.3-mi) apogee and 166.7-km (103.6-mi) perigee. Insertion into trajectory toward moon was achieved at 2:34 get in spite of minor anomalies\u2014leak in instrument unit (iu) temperature control system\u2019s gaseous nitrogen bottle pressure and malfunction of S\u2014IVB auxiliary propulsion system (aps) helium regulators, which caused continuous venting. CSM separation from Lm/S-IVB/iu at 3:05 GET and docking with LM was shown on color TV for 18 min. First S-1VB APS burn was near nominal, but because of helium depletion and potential trajectory disturbances, second bum was not made and S-IVB lunar impact operations were terminated. Tracking of stage ended at 27:09 get when IU signal was lost. S-IVB impacted lunar surface at 75:08 get (4:02 pm EST April 19) at point estimated to be 1.8° north latitude and 23.3° west longitude. Impact was detected by seismometers at Apollo 12, 14, and 15 sites. Unexplained light-colored particles streaming from LM close-out panel during docking were reported by crew at 7:18 GET. Young and Duke entered lm, powered up, and found all systems normal. Grasslike particles, shown on cm TV, were later identified as shredded thermal paint, but degraded thermal protection was not expected to affect LM operations. First midcourse correction (MCC\u20141) was canceled because spacecraft trajectory was near nominal. Electrophoresis demonstration began on schedule at 25:05 get and appeared to be successful, from crew\u2019s description of reaction of charged particles in liquid. Ultraviolet (uv) photographs of earth from 107 300 km (66 700 mi) and 216 600 km (134 600 mi) were taken as planned. Duke reported \u201cspectacular\u201d view of half earth from 201 000-km (125 000-mi) altitude when he could see sun shining on only half of planet. During MCC-2, made at 30:39 get, services propulsion system (sps) tank pressure anomaly that had occurred earlier in mission was tracked and minor leak in transducer reference cavity was located. Procedures were sent to crew to account for transducer reading. Visual light flash experiment was started about two hours late, at 49:10 get, because of problem in aligning spacecraft. Duke counted 70 white, instantaneous light flashes that left no after-glow, uv photography of earth at 327 800 km (203 700 mi) was completed as planned. Young and Duke entered lm at 53:50 get for two-hour checkout of LM systems. All system checks were nominal. Scientific instrument module (sim) door jettisoned at 69:59 get. csm\u2014lm undocking and separation maneuver was conducted on schedule at 96:14 get. When Young and Duke came from behind moon in lm, Duke told Mission Control his helmet was full of orange juice. Duke\u2019s microphone apparently had become entangled with tube through which he drank juice stored in his spacesuit. \u201cEvery time I turn my head I get orange juice. It\u2019s delicious . . . hut it\u2019s better in your mouth than floating around the cockpit. I\u2019ve already had an orange shampoo.\u201d When Mattingly came from behind moon in csm he reported he had not conducted circularization burn because of malfunction in SPS yaw gimbal servo loop. While flight controllers evaluated problem, LM-powered descent-initiate maneuver was delayed, and LM and CSM maneuvered into station-keeping mode prepared to dock or continue landing procedures. Analysis of problem identified malfunction in secondary circuit that would not preclude lunar landing. Second separation maneuver by CSM with RCS burn was performed and LM began descent to moon on 16th revolution. LM Orion touched down in moon\u2019s Descartes region 230 m (755 ft) northwest of planned target point at 104:30 GET (9:23 pm EST April 20). \u201cWow, down. Old Orion is finally here, Houston. Fantastic,\u201d Duke exclaimed. \u201cAll we\u2019ve got to do is jump out the hatch and we\u2019ve got plenty of rocks.\u201d Duke and Young said site was rolling country surrounded by mountains and covered with big boulders. Sunlight was so bright it washed out moon\u2019s colors and made lunar surface appear white. Since LM had stayed in lunar orbit six hours longer than planned it was powered down to conserve electrical power and first extravehicular activity (EVA-1) was rescheduled to follow sleep period. EVA-1 began at 119:05 get (11:59 am est April 21). Young climbed down ladder and stepped onto lunar surface. \u201cOkay, Cayley Plains,\u201d he said, \u201cApollo 16 is gonna change your image.\u201d Duke followed and astronauts began deploying experiments. Because of problems with LM antenna astronauts\u2019 first steps on moon\u2014for first time\u2014were not beamed back to earth. Once Young and Duke set up portable antenna, TV signal and communication with ground controllers were received clearly on earth. TV pictures showed bleak, pale surface resembling Apollo 15 site, with flat-topped Smoky Mountain to north and Stone Mountain to south. Astronauts said site was rockier, more hilly, and more cratered than previous landing sites. Soil was firm, with rocks scattered over 30% of the surface and small craters covering 70%. During deployment of Apollo lunar surface experiments package (alsep) Young tripped over heat flow experiment (hfe) cable, pulling it from connector after Duke had drilled first bore hole. Mission Control later developed way to repair $1.2-million experiment, but procedure was not used because it would have been too complex and too time consuming and included some risk to other ALSEP components. U.S. flag and remaining ALSEP components were deployed successfully and functioned nominally. Crew deployed lrv and found ampere readings for battery No. 2 off-scale low and rear steering inoperable. About 40 min later, after loading, all meters and rear steering operated properly and LRV performed nominally throughout remainder of EVA. Young and Duke explored Flag, Spook, Plum, and Buster Craters and collected 20 kg (44 lbs) of samples, including number of white rocks. One crystalline rock coated with bluish glass appeared to have same texture as anorthosite \u201cGenesis rock\u201d collected on Apollo 15 mission; another was pure white. Some were flecked with green and black glass, some were black and gray, and one weighed about 6% kg (14 lbs). EVA-1 terminated at 126:16 get after 7 hrs 11 min 11 sec. After resting inside LM and reviewing plans for second EVA, astronauts left LM at 142:51 get (11:33 am est April 22). They explored Survey Ridge and Stone Mountain and said ridge was pockmarked with small, subdued craters, most about one meter {three feet) wide and some containing smaller craters within main crater. Area around South Ray Crater was strewn with sharp boulders and resembled crater in Nevada where astronauts had trained. Young and Duke turned on lrv TV so viewers could watch them walking and collecting samples high up on slope of Stone Mountain. They reported seeing more of previously discovered white soil under gray surface layers and said soil was very loosely consolidated. While ascending ridge and traversing very rocky terrain, LRV rear wheels failed to respond at full throttle, lrv continued to move, hut front wheels were digging in. Troubleshooting procedures identified mismatch of power mode switching. After change in switch configuration lrv worked properly. Astronauts took core samples and collected rocks that appeared to be volcanic, a greenish rock shaped like a snake\u2019s head, and pure crystalline rocks. EVA was televised in color with lrv camera and was extended 20 min. During crew\u2019s return to LM, 5-cm (2-in) portion of Young\u2019s portable life support system (plss) antenna broke off, causing 15- to 18-db drop in signal strength. EVA\u20142 ended at 150:14 get after 7 hrs 23 min 26 sec. Third eva began 30 min early at 165:45 get (10:27 am est April 23)\tto allow additional time near North Ray Crater and two other stations. Astronauts chipped off samples from enormous basalt rock the size of a house. All planned activities were accomplished, but astronauts had trouble configuring cosmic ray detector for stowage and return to earth, lrv covered 9% km (6 mi) and reached 17 km per hr (11 mph) going down 15° slope. TV coverage was excellent throughout eva. Total EVA-3 time was 5 hrs 40 min 14 sec\u2014bringing total eva time to 20 hrs 14 min 54 sec and total distance traversed to 27.1 km (16.8 mi). While LM was on moon, Mattingly, orbiting moon in Casper, completed lunar and astronomic photography and prepared for rendezvous. He radioed information to geologists at Mission Control to help them plan EVA\u20143 exploration of Stone Mountain and determine best way to approach North Ray Crater. He located radioactive hot spot on eastern edge of Ocean of Storms south of Apollo 14 landing site and gamma spectrometer identified thorium, potassium, and uranium. Mattingly also discovered, on far side of moon, volcanic lava flows that resembled maria flows and spilled out over northeast rim of crater high in mountains near lunar equator. Two areas resembled volcanic flows around Flagstaff, Ariz., where crew had trained. Many large basins on moon\u2019s far side appeared to be covered with same kind of material that covered area around Apollo 16 site. Young and Duke depressurized LM, discarded excess equipment, repressurized lm, and lifted off lunar surface with 96.6 kg (213 lbs) of lunar samples at 175:44 get (8:26 pm est April 24). Liftoff was photographed in color by camera on LRV left on moon and was seen by millions of TV viewers. Spacecraft docked successfully and LM crew transferred samples, film, and equipment to CSM. For first time docking was not seen on TV, because LM steerable antenna was inoperable. LM jettison was delayed one day so that astronauts could rest. After LM jettison at 195:12 GET, LM lost altitude and began tumbling, apparently because circuit breaker in attitude-and-translation-controller assembly\u2019s primary guidance and navigation system had accidentally been left open. LM ascent stage remained in lunar orbit and was expected to impact lunar surface in about one year. Boom that carried instrument to measure atmosphere of moon was jettisoned because it would not retract and might have broken off. Orbit-shaping maneuvers were canceled to avoid firing of SPS because of degraded backup SPS thrust vector control. Scientific Subsatellite was launched at 196:14 get (4:56 est April 24)\tinto lunar orbit with 123.3-km (76.6-mi) apolune and 97.9-km (60.8-mi) perilune. Hexagonal, 40-kg (90-lb) satellite 77 cm long and 36 cm in diameter (30 x 14 in) carried three experiments. Subsatellite extended three 1%-m (5-ft) booms, two with magnetometer sensors to measure interplanetary and earth magnetic fields near moon and third for stabilization. Spacecraft also carried particle shadows and boundary layer experiment to collect data on plasmas and solar flares and S-band transponder to detect variations in lunar gravity caused by mascons. Expected lifetime was 6 to 9 mos\u2014shorter than 12 mos planned because shaping burn to optimize orbit had not been performed\u2014but Subsatellite crashed into moon May 29. Transearth injection maneuver at 200:33 get put CSM on trajectory for earth after 114 hrs 5 min (65 revolutions) in lunar orbit. April 25-27:\tGood-quality TV pictures of receding moon from inside CM and of lunar surface from LRV on moon were transmitted between 227 and 229 get. At 243:35 get (3:43 pm est April 25) Mattingly left CSM for inflight EVA to retrieve panoramic and mapping camera film cassettes from SIM on SM. Mattingly made two trips, during which he observed condition of instruments, reported that insulation paint near rocket nozzle was blistered, and deployed and exposed microbial ecological evaluation device (meed) experiment for 10 min. He reentered CSM after 1 hr 24 min. Scheduled TV press conference began at 268:13 GET and ended at 268:31 GET. Astronauts briefly described moon\u2019s far side, including crater Guyot, which seemed to be so full of material that it overflowed and spilled down side of the crater. CM separated from SM at 290:08 GET, 15 min before entry interface at 121900-m (400 000-ft) altitude. Drogue and main parachutes deployed normally and CM splashed down and flipped upside-down in mid-Pacific about 5 km (3 mi) from recovery ship U.S.S. Ticonderoga at 2:44 pm EST April 27, after 11-day 2-hr (265-hr 51-min) mission. After flipping spacecraft upright by inflating air bags, astronauts, wearing fresh flight suits, left CM and were carried by helicopter to biomed area on recovery ship for postflight examinations. After being declared in excellent condition, astronauts were flown on following day to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and to Ellington afb, Tex. Young had lost 3% kg (7% lbs); Mattingly, 3 kg (6V2 lbs); and Duke, 2% kg (5% lbs), but all were \u201ceuphoric, hungry and thirsty, and walking well.\u201d CM was retrieved and placed in dolly on board recovery ship. Lunar samples, data, and equipment were flown to Ellington afb and cm was off-loaded at San Diego. Mission achieved primary Apollo 16 objectives: to make selenologi-cal survey and sampling of materials in preselected area of Descartes region; emplace and activate surface experiments; evaluate capability of Apollo equipment to provide extended lunar surface stay time, increased EVA operations, and surface mobility; and conduct inflight experiments and photographic tasks from lunar orbit. Launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performance were near nominal except for lack of rate feedback in thrust vector control and yaw oscillations that delayed lunar landing, caused revision of lunar surface activities, and necessitated end of mission one day earlier than planned. All anomalies were quickly analyzed and resolved or compensated for by workaround procedures developed to permit mission to continue. Flight crew performance was excellent. Minor errors made by crew were attributed to fatigue and did not preclude mission success. Mission was officially judged a success. Accomplishments included largest payload (34 518 kg; 76100 lbs) placed in lunar orbit, first cosmic ray detector deployed on lunar surface, first use of far-UV camera on lunar surface, longest lunar surface stay time (71 hrs 14 min), longest lunar surface EVA (20 hrs 15 min), and largest amount of lunar samples brought to earth (96.6 kg; 213 lbs). In addition, astronauts returned 3793.5 m (12 446 ft) of exposed film used on lunar surface and in lunar orbit.

The characteristic pattern was a Soviet achievement announced to a surprised world, followed some months later by a more sophisticated and more useful U.S. version of the same mission, yielding far more scientific data, but little prestige.\u201d U.S.S.R. program was characterized by excessive secrecy because, according to Soviet officials, rockets used in space program were similar to those used in military program. Smith said genuine reason for secrecy \u201cis the desire to guard against a failure in the full blaze of world publicity.\u201d U.S.S.R. \u201cguards against ever having to admit failure by announcing launches only post facto. If there is a launch pad failure there is no announcement at all. If orbit is reached by the spacecraft, but it does not function as planned, no mention is made of this in the curt bulletin.\u201d If lunar or planetary probe failed to enter planned trajectory, mission objective \u201cis not mentioned, and the spacecraft is merely allocated a number in the catch-all Cosmos series. ... It is impossible to be absolutely certain how many of these escape stage failures there have been, but there may have been as many as 10 or 15 aimed at Venus and Mars alone.\u201d Soviet program had \u201clittle ... of the technical virtuosity of the American approach,\u201d but had more impetus and would \u201cobviously continue on a growing scale. Apart from the progress in individual projects, the ever increasing number of Soviet launches demonstrates that the Russian equivalent of NASA is financially more secure. And the speed with which the Soviet space establishment can respond to a failure is also a pointer to the massive scale of the back-up precautions which are taken.\u201d Soviet program, by its nature, was ensured greater financial security. \u201cBy their very success in being able to reach an unparalleled level of technology in their spacecraft, the American engineers have been working against their own best interests.\u201d {Bull Atom Sci, 4/72, 18-24)",

Strangway, Chief of msc Geophysics Branch, said magnetic sample returned to moon on Apollo 16 \u201cdid pick up fairly strong component of soft magnetization as the result of exposure to the spacecraft systems. On return to the earth, however, we were able to clean that out and to recover the original hard component of magnetization which is what ... we were hoping to do.\u201d Experiment had worked out \u201cquite successfully and suggests that the soft components that we\u2019re seeing in the rocks is indeed of spacecraft origin and is not an artifact of some kind that came from the lunar surface. ... if it did come from the lunar surface we\u2019ve contaminated it so much that we can\u2019t sort it out afterwards.

Samples had very high concentrations of aluminum and calcium\u201426%% aluminum oxide and 15% calcium\u2014\u201cvery different from what we see everywhere on the surface of the earth.\u201d X-rays of core tubes showed dispersion throughout soil of metal particles\u2014probably metallic iron\u2014up to 0.5 cm (0.2 in) in diameter. Tentative conclusion was \u201cthat metallic iron, both in the soil and the rocks, is very much more abundant at this site than it\u2019s been at any other site on the moon and this may be a qualitative characteristic of the Apollo 16 site and perhaps a qualitative characteristic of the highlands is that rocks there contain bits of metallic iron. It is tempting to speculate that this has something to do with the high magnetic field at this region.\u201d Although scientists couldn\u2019t tell just from looking at rocks whether any were volcanic, \u201cthe opinion is evolving that they are not.\u201d Rocks appeared, to naked eye, to be impact breccias.

Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes. The agreement included a prefect to rendezvous and dock an American and a Soviet spacecraft in earth orbit and exchange astronaut and cosmonaut visits in each other's spacecraft during }975. In the photo of the docked model, the first two segments at lower left are the Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, the cylindrical structure in the center is the docking module, and the Apollo command and service module is at the upper right, such other ways as may he mutually agreed. Joint working groups may be created for the development and implementation of appropriate programs of cooperation. \u201cArticle 3. The Parties have agreed to carry out projects for developing compatible rendezvous and docking systems of United States and Soviet manned spacecraft and stations in order to enhance the safety of manned flights in space and to provide the opportunity for conducting joint scientific experiments in the future. It is planned that the first experimental flight to test these systems be conducted during 1975, envisaging the docking of the United States Apollo-type spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz-type spacecraft with visits of Astronauts in each other\u2019s spacecraft. The implementation of these projects will he carried out on the basis of principles and procedures which will be developed in accordance with the Summary of Results of the Meeting Between Representatives of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences on Question of Developing Compatible Systems for Rendezvous and Docking of Manned Spacecraft and Space Stations of the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. dated April 6, 1972. \u201cArticle 4. The Parties will encourage international efforts to resolve problems of international law in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes with the aim of strengthening the legal order in space and further developing international space law and will cooperate in this field. \u201cArticle 5. The Parties may by mutual agreement determine other areas of cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. \u201cArticle 6. This Agreement shall enter into force upon signature and shall remain in force for five years. It may be modified or extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.\u201d Plans for joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission were outlined in Fact Sheet issued by White House Press Secretary in Moscow: \u201cUnder today\u2019s agreement both sides commit to the development of a complete project schedule, and to meeting that schedule. Arrangements will be made for the necessary contact and understanding between specialists. . . . Training exercises will be conducted in [each] country for the other country\u2019s flight crew and ground operations personnel.\u201d Working groups would meet in July to plan engineering aspects of mission. Persons directly participating in flight operations of test mission would be included in working groups two years before mission. During mission each country\u2019s control center would be expected to control its own craft, but on decisions affecting joint elements of program\u2014including countdown coordination\u2014consultations would occur with other country. \u201cThere will be preplanned contingency courses of action. Television down-link will be transmitted to the other country\u2019s control center, and voice communications between vehicle and ground will be available to the other country\u2019s control center on a pre-planned basis.\u201d Flight crews would be trained in other country\u2019s language at least well enough to understand it and act in response during normal and contingency courses of action. Apollo command and service module (csm) and Saturn IB booster would be used. Additional cost of mission to U.S. would be about $250 million. Project Directors would be Glynn S.

Lunney, Assistant to Apollo Program Manager for Operations, Experiments, and Government Furnished Equipment at Manned Spacecraft Center; and Apollo 9 Astronaut James A. McDivitt, Special Assistant for Organizational Affairs to msc Director. Dr. Fletcher said: \u201cWe . . . are very pleased that the President has been able to meet with the officials of the Soviet Union and to provide what we think is by far the most meaningful cooperation in space achieved ever by these two nations.\u201d Dr. Fletcher described rendezvous and docking of Apollo space craft and Soviet Soyuz spacecraft as \u201cperhaps the most dramatic\u201d commitment under cooperation agreement. Spacecraft were at present incompatible \u201cbecause they have different atmospheres. Theirs is a normal atmosphere, ours is a low pressure oxygen . . . atmosphere and there are certain communications and electronics incompatibilities.\u201d Spacecraft would be made compatible by docking module, new device constructed by NASA to link spacecraft. Apollo spacecraft would be launched on Saturn IB rocket. \u201cThen we will make a maneuver at 100 miles [160 kilometers] or so altitude, ... go in and pick out the docking adaptor from the Saturn and then continue on in orbit. Meanwhile the Soviets will launch their Soyuz . . . [and] rendezvous or at least move their altitude to something like 150 miles [240 kilometers]. We won\u2019t be at the same altitude, but hopefully we will be far enough north so too much maneuvering will not be required.\u201d Rendezvous would be performed primarily with U.S.-developed guidance and instrumentation. Then spacecraft would dock with \u201cnew kind of . . . mechanism we call androgynous, because it doesn\u2019t consist of a prop and a drogue. ... It is an inverse docking mechanism sp they can dock with us or we can dock with them either way.\u201d System \u201cwill apply not only to this . . . mission, but all succeeding spacecraft ... so that we do have the capability, over a long period, of rendezvousing and docking with each other\u2019s spacecraft.\u201d Dr. Fletcher said original plan to attempt rendezvous and docking with Soviet Salyut space station had been canceled when U.S.S.R. \u201cfound that was a very complicated mission because it involved not just two launches, their Soyuz and our apollo, but a third of their Salyut.\u201d Universal docking system using docking adaptor between Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft had been selected because \u201cthere has been concern for many years that we did not have a rescue capability ... in space [so] that we each would have the option of rescuing the other. Future spacecraft beyond 1975, which is the planned date for this mission, will all have the capability.\u201d Total cost of project was estimated at $250 million. Fringe benefits from U.S.-U.S.S.R. joint program were: \u201cIt does have the impact of requiring 4,400 people to be employed . . . primarily from the aerospace industry, partly to prepare the command service model and the Saturn IB launch device, hut also to construct the new docking adaptor,\u201d and \u201cit will keep the APOLLO team together . . . through 1975 in preparation for the first launch of the shuttle ... in 1978.\u201d NASA was optimistic that cooperative space effort \u201cmay lead to greatly increased cooperation on still other programs.\u201d Joint mission would be \u201cmost visible\u201d U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative effort in history, \u201csince it will involve cosmonauts and astronauts working together on a very complex mission in space while the whole world is watching, presumably on television via satellite relay.\u201d (Transcript)",

A case may be made either way. . . .\u201d {WSJ, 5/26/72) Christian Science Monitor saw agreement as \u201ccommitment to peace, to friendly relations in the years ahead on the part of the world\u2019s two superpowers.\u201d Agreement meant extension of Apollo program to bridge gap between last Skylab mission in 1973 and 1978 space shuttle flights. \u201cIt will mean an estimated 4,400 more jobs in the aerospace industry. It will mean that Soviet space crews will come to the United States for training and vice versa. And once the rendezvous is made televiewers in both countries will be able to watch their astronauts moving from one spacecraft to another and conducting joint scientific experiments.\u201d (CSM, 5/25/72) Miami Herald: \u201cBoth sides may learn a bit from each other .... What most people will learn is likely to be more meaningful because emotions are the mainspring of human attitudes and actions.

Committee recommended for secondary priority: construction of very large millimeter-wavelength antenna to identify and study complex molecules and to study quasars in their most explosive stages; doubling of support for astrophysical observations from aircraft, balloons, and rockets, at wavelengths from far infrared to gamma rays; continuation of Orbiting Solar Observatories through oso-L, \u2014M, and -N, with updating of ground-based solar facilities; increased support for theoretical investigations; expansion of optical space astronomy, including high-resolution imagery and ultraviolet spectroscopy, leading to launch of large space telescope at beginning of next decade; and construction of large, steerable radiotelescope to obtain observations with high angular resolution and to record emission from more distant objects than now possible.

Why is the occurrence of lunar norite or kreep so sharply restricted to the northwest quadrant of the moon\u2019s nearside?

Now we are seeing that Mars has a character all its own. It is not earth-like or moon-like, it is Mars-like.\u201d Harold Masursky of U.S. Geological Survey said Mars could be divided into four major geological provinces: Nix Olympica-Tharis volcanic province with volcanoes up to 8 km (5 mi) high and 500 km (300 mi) in diameter; Ophir-Eos equatorial plateau region with faults and rifts 5 km (3 mi) deep; cratered and smooth terrains with large circular basins like lunar impact basins; and south polar cratered terrain covered with glacial sediment layers up to 100 m (330 ft) thick. Convincing evidence that water had played active role in evolution of Mars was shown in Mariner 9 photos of deep, winding channels that might have once been beds of fast-flowing streams. Masursky suggested two explanations for apparent heavy rains and floods on Mars in past: volcanic heat might have melted water ice stored below surface as permafrost or increased dosages of sunlight on polar caps every 50 000 yrs, because of axis wobbling, might have melted polar caps completely. Dr. Geoffrey A. Biggs of Jpl described north polar hood of variable clouds that appeared to have general west-to-east flow pattern, with some systems resembling small cyclones.

During three-month expedition, series of meteorological rockets 'had carried Soviet and French payloads to altitudes between 90 and 180 km (56 and 112 mi) during period of transition from winter to summer and from polar night to polar day. Data were obtained on atmospheric temperature, wind speed and direction, cloud formations, corpuscular radiation, and solar activity. (FBIS-Sov, 6/16/72, LI) June 15:\tDr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, and Apollo 16 Astronauts Charles M. Duke, Jr., John W. Young, and Thomas K. Mattingly II met with President Nixon at White House to discuss April 16-27 Apollo 16 mission and joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission scheduled for 1975. Following discussion Dr. Fletcher and astronauts held press conference. Dr. Fletcher said President was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with progress made toward joint mission. \u201cThe President particularly wanted to emphasize that . . . this is only the beginning of what he conceives as a long association with the Soviet Union in many other areas of space cooperation. ... we are busy working on other kinds of things that we can do together . . . perhaps through the turn of the century, doing things together for economic reasons and because he feels strongly that the international aspect of this is important in improving relationships. If we can do this together, we can do other things together.\u201d President also emphasized worldwide space cooperation. As areas for U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in future, Dr. Fletcher thought \u201cthe ones we can be sure of\u201d were \u201cthe cooperative program on Mars [and] a new cooperative program on Venus, where we explore the upper atmosphere and the entire atmosphere and they explore the surface. We are going to be doing that together.\u201d (Other nasa officials explained later these would be coordinated efforts rather than joint missions.) July meeting of principals at Manned Spacecraft Center would \u201ciron out the management\u201d of joint docking mission. Astronaut Young said that \u201creal problem\u201d was communication; \u201conce we solve that problem we can prove that we can work together in a lot of other areas besides.\u201d Dr. Fletcher said plans for joint astronaut and cosmonaut training had not been concluded, \u201cbut it is going to be absolutely essential that the cosmonauts come over here and train on our equipment and vice versa. That much has been agreed to.\u201d Training program probably would start \u201cwithin about a year.\u201d Dr. Fletcher summed up progress made on joint mission since May 24 signing of cooperation agreement: \u201cWe have set up the agenda for the meeting which will primarily involve the management aspects. ... We also have, at home, worked out some of the details of the specifications . . . and now are waiting approval.\u201d Perhaps most \u201cspectacular\u201d progress had been \u201cgreat enthusiasm from Congress for the mission, particularly when we told them this was not going to cost any more money.\u201d (Transcript; WSJ, 6/16/72)\t.",

Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics\u2019 Subcommittee on International Cooperation in Science and Space on U.S.\u2014U.S.S.R. agreement on cooperation in space [May 24]. He described events that led to agreement on joint rendezvous and docking mission: Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, then nasa Administrator, had suggested to Soviet Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov during April 1970 meeting in New York \u201cpossibility of cooperation in the area of astronaut safety, including compatible docking fixtures for space stations and shuttles.\u201d National Academy of Sciences President, Dr. Philip Handler, had conveyed NASA\u2019s interest to Soviet Academy President Mstislav V. Keldysh. \u201cIn July, Dr. Paine suggested directly to President Keldysh that this possibility be considered.\u201d Dr. Low said if docking mission was successful, \u201cboth countries will have increased their chances of rescuing astronauts in distress without commensurate increase in the costs of a standby rescue capability. It is here that the joint test mission is particularly important. It will give us the opportunity to identify and resolve under the best possible conditions the problems we can expect to flow from differences in language, equipment, and operational procedures.\u201d Joint working groups were making significant progress. Space meteorology group was organizing experiments to advance temperature sounding from satellites and microwave measurement of precipitation zones, ice conditions, and sea surface roughness and temperature. Another joint working group had provided for coordination of meridional sounding rocket networks in Eastern and Western Hemispheres and had begun to exchange operational and scientific meteorological data. Working group on natural environment was defining coordinated experiments in remote sensing of the environment related to vegetation, geology, and the oceans. Oceanographic effort would continue satellite and ship measurements over same ocean area. In group on scientific investigation of near-earth space, moon, and planets, \u201cexperts from both sides have been working on a common system of lunar coordinates and a program for compiling a complete map of the moon on the scale of 1:5,000,000.\u201d Group on space biology and medicine was \u201cconsidering certain common standards and procedures to increase the comparability of information.\u201d If U.S. and U.S.S.R. could work together to achieve \u201cintimate and complex common goal\u201d like joint space mission, \u201cwe will have built mutual confidence and trust.

Rocket and instrumentation performed satisfactorily. (SR list) June 22:\tPress conference on preliminary results of Apollo 16 experiments was held at Manned Spacecraft Center. Dr. Fairouk El-Baz of photo-geology team described metric camera photo of old, three-ring basin about 960 km (600 mi) in diameter on far side of moon. Eastern part of ring coincided with \u201cwhat the Soviets had called some 10 years ago right after the Luna 3 photographs . . . the Soviet Mountains.\u201d NASA had concluded from Lunar Orbiter and Apollo 8 photos that formation was not mountains but \u201cthe coincidence of very bright rays from two relatively young craters,\u201d and U.S.S.R. had conceded to elimination of Soviet Mountains from lunar dictionary. Apollo 16 photos showed, however, that \u201cwhat we have here is really the Soviet Mountains rediscovered, so to speak, that is part of a middle ring of a very old basin.\u201d Dr. EI-Baz said that, pending approval of International Astronomical Union, large basin would be named Arabia in honor of Arab contributions to astronomy, eastern range of middle ring of basin would be called Soviet Mountains, and long western range of middle ring discovered by Apollo 16 would be called American Mountains. Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal investigator for passive seismic experiment, said May 13 meteorite impact on moon \u201cmay well turn out to be the most important single seismic event the Apollo Network will record in its life unless the good fairy sends us another fragment of rock. It provided very important confirmation of the structure that we have proposed based on the S-IVB impact.\u201d Seismometers had also recorded other meteorite impacts and dozens of moonquakes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to establish at least the presence of 20 different moonquake source locations. They . . . have the familiar pattern which can be correlated with lunar tides and hence are triggered by lunar tides.\u201d Most puzzling question was what energy source within moon caused moonquakes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the answer to that. We do have the puzzling fact that the two source zones we\u2019ve located are nearly 900 kilometers [560 miles] deep . . . the depth at which our very tentative evidence places a reflector. . . . there seems something special about that depth. All of the Moon above that depth within our network area, at least, must be . . . solid. Very high frequency seismic waves can propagate through it. Such high frequencies are eliminated from terrestrial earthquake signals by a partially molten low velocity zone.\u201d If part of moon were molten, \u201cit\u2019s either in very, very small isolated pockets or at greater depth than 1000 kilometers [620 miles].\u201d Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of msc Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said about 90% of Apollo 16 lunar samples consisted of aluminum-and calcium-rich material. \u201cThe aluminum and calcium concentration . . . approach the composition of pure plagioclase ... a name component of . . . anorthosite. They are very typical of what one finds in the highlands anywhere on the moon where we have any chemical data. Now, the negative side of that conclusion is that these rocks are not as had been thought prior to the mission, a kind of volcanic rock that is rich in silica ... a viscous volcanic rock. It\u2019s quite definite that the so-called Cayley formation ... is not a volcanic formation and I think we can generalize with some confidence that... it probably is not a volcanic formation in the other places on the moon where it has been identified or mapped in, either. There are a few rocks . . . which are distinctly different\u201d from the rest in lower aluminum concentration, 15 to 18 percent, and higher magnesium-iron concentration with composition that could be that of volcanic rocks. They were also high in potassium and phosphorus. From Apollo data scientists had identified four major types of rocks: grey breccias that contained black and white clasts (rock fragments); black feldspar rock that appeared under microscope to be igneous because it was tough and dense; very white cataclasites of crushed plagioclase-rich material; and crystalline rocks. One rock in Apollo 16 samples, \u201crusty rock,\u201d was covered by red, rust-like coating. Identification of rust, so far, was only visual; x-ray and mineralogical tests had not yet been made. \u201cIt may turn out to be ... a more exotic type of iron compound than simple rust. It\u2019s quite definite that this ... is something that\u2019s rusting; it\u2019s something that took place on the Moon . . . not ... in the spacecraft on the way back or from handling the rock. The coatings are dispersed through the inside of the rock and too thick and too diverse to have been formed in the spacecraft.\u201d (Transcript)",

Lunney said that during series of meetings that had begun July 6, U.S. and U.S.S.R. had discussed and agreed on \u201cthe technical content of three very important project level documents\u201d: project technical proposal that described mission and hardware elements, organizational plan that described how countries would work together in controlling project before and during flight, and schedule of activities. Officials had also concluded \u201ctechnically detailed documents describing the agreements that we\u2019ve reached on various systems,\u201d such as docking aids, docking targets, control systems, and docking mechanism. Further technical discussions would be held in U.S.S.R. in fall. Preliminary plans called for launch of Apollo spacecraft carrying three astronauts 7% hrs after launch of Soyuz with two cosmonauts. Second Soyuz would be ready as backup if Apollo could not be launched during one of three launch opportunities. On Apollo\u2019s 14th revolution spacecraft would rendezvous and dock, using U.S.-built docking mechanism on Apollo. After docking, two astronauts would pass through airlock into Soyuz and spend several hours with cosmonauts before returning to Apollo for night. Next day one astronaut and one cosmonaut would exchange places for whole day. After returning to own spacecraft, crews would undock vehicles and complete separate missions. Apollo would probably remain in orbit nine more days and Soyuz about one more day. Docking would be televised. Bushuyev praised \u201cfriendly atmosphere\u201d and \u201cwonderful conditions\u201d of meetings and said friendliness was \u201cthe greatest achievement and the most important assurance for the success in our future work. The difficult tasks that we are called upon to solve . . . would be impossible unless these conditions existed. We are on the first stage of a very long and difficult journey. I believe that the most important thing that we succeeded in achieving so far is the following: We succeeded in identifying and solving those basic and important problems without the solution of which further work . . . would be impossible. These various problems which we have now solved will permit us to start the planning, design, and actual construction and manufacture of the various assemblies . . . necessary for the realization of our project.\u201d (Transcript; nytns, W Star, 7/18/72, A4)",

NASA\u2019s Apollo 11 mission had proved that man could carry out scientific and technological work on another planet and had fulfilled U.S. goal established in 1961 of developing technology to transport man to moon and return him safely to earth within 1960s. Since Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., spent 2 hrs 31 min on moon\u2019s Sea of Tranquility July 20, 1969, NASA had launched five more Apollo missions. Eight men had explored moon at four different sites for 55 hrs 34 min. Four geophysical stations placed on moon were transmitting scientific data, 272 kg (600 lbs) of lunar samples had been brought to earth, 16 different scientific experiments had been conducted on lunar surface 48 times, and 17 different experiments had been conducted in lunar orbit 41 times. Apollo 17, last mission in program, was scheduled for launch Dec. 6. Manned Spacecraft Center expanded regular public open house activities with special Mission Control Center program re-creating radio transmissions between Apollo 11 crew and Mission Control Center during lunar landing, duplicating flight controller displays, and showing motion pictures taken during mission. Neil Armstrong Air and Space Museum in Wapakoneta, Ohio, home of Apollo 11 astronaut who was first man on moon, held informal opening to mark anniversary. President Nixon\u2019s daughter, Tricia N.

Let\u2019s quit playing cozy and bring the facts into the open so the public can make its own judgment.\u201d {C Daily News, 8/12-13/72) Primary objective was to evaluate effectiveness of bumper-protected multisheet spacecraft structure for protection against meteoroid penetration in first inflight test. Data would be compared with data from single-sheet structures launched previously. Secondary objectives were to obtain data on meteoroid impact velocity and measure impact flux of small mass meteoroids. Satellite had been designed, fabricated, and tested by Langley Research Center. It carried three experiments: bumper penetration experiment with 12 panels, each 48 cm wide and 3 m long (19 in x 10Y2 ft), containing 8 pressurized cells; impact flux experiment containing 65 thin-film capacitance penetration sensors arranged in groups of 3 and 5 on various parts of spacecraft; and meteoroid-velocity experiment consisting of 2 plates of sensors and timer to measure time meteoroid traveled distance between plates. By Aug. 22 spacecraft experiments and telemetry systems were operating and good data were being obtained, but half of panels in bumper experiment apparently had not deployed. Spacecraft was spinning at 3 rpm as planned, but because of panel deployment anomaly and resulting spin axis 90° to that planned, spacecraft battery temperature had risen from 299 K (79°F) past 308 K (95°F) design temperature to 337 K (147°F) Aug. 22. Battery was still providing voltage and all experiments were functioning satisfactorily. During spacecraft\u2019s second pass Aug. 22, telemeter A, powered by battery, came on as commanded but telemeter B, backup system operated by solar-cell power, went off unexpectedly. Officials decided to discontinue interrogation of telemeter A so that data from telemeter B would not be jeopardized. As a result, no data were being received from secondary experiments and no housekeeping data were received. About 2000 impacts by submicrometer particles had been detected during telemeter A operation, providing sufficient data for impact experiment. No data had been obtained from meteoroid-velocity experiment. By Aug. 28, 3 of 48 pressurized detector cells successfully deployed had been punctured and primary experiment was continuing to provide good data, (nasa proj off)",

Ryan (usaf) in Armed Forces Journal issue dedicated to Air Force Silver Anniversary. \u201cIt would be very easy ... to take off on rhetorical flights of overcoming the unlimited challenges of aerospace. The challenges do exist; and they could conceivably mean that the future of the Air Force will include the use of remotely piloted vehicles, hypersonic aircraft, and the laser. But if these, and anything else man can envision and produce, do exist in the future, they will only be the means for Air Force people to do their basic job of providing this country with the aerospace power required for defense and security. As in the past 25 years, success in the future depends heavily on the dedication and quality of Air Force people.\u201d (Airman, 9/72, 25; AFSC Newsreview, 9/72, 6, 9; AFJ, 9/72; Dept of AF, A Chronology of American Air Space Events, 1/3/61)",

Some U.S. officials believed U.S.S.R. was establishing precedent for using Cuba as base from which to launch and recover reconnaissance satellites. In first reported incident two naval reconnaissance versions of Tu-95 Bear turboprop aircraft made 12-hr flight from Cuba up route 80 km (50 mi) off U.S. coast to point north of Norfolk, Va. Flights had been detected by radar on U.S.S. Forrestal and had been monitored by F-4 and A-7 aircraft. Although Tu-95s had flown off U.S. East Coast for past several years, they had not taken off from Cuba, flown mission, and then returned to Cuba before. (Av Wk, 9/18/72, 11) September 18\u201421:\tTwentieth International Congress of Aviation and Space Medicine was held in Nice, France. More than 500 scientists from 54 countries participated. Dr. Charles A. Berry, NASA Director for Life Sciences, discussed human problems in long-duration space flights: Long-term bedrest data offered some clues to potential effects of weightlessness on physiological systems. There were indications that some zero-g effects were self-limiting. Collection of good inflight data for longer periods, coupled with ground-based experiments, was vital in planning for longer duration space flight. Vestibular problems had not been great enough for U.S. crews to require preadaptation program. \u201cSuch a program must, however, be considered as the number of potential crewmen is increased, particularly as scientists with no test pilot experience are added to crews. However, I do not at the present time see any physiological requirement for the addition of artificial gravity for long duration space flight.\u201d Soviet delegation was headed by Dr. Oleg G. Gazenko, Director of Institute of Space Biology of Soviet Academy of Sciences. (Text; fbis-Sov, 10/3/72, A7)",

Studies of first alternative were under way; contracted studies within next year were expected to examine latter two alternatives. (Text) Sixth International History of Astronautics Symposium, held Oct. 13, was chaired by Dr. Eugene M. Emme, NASA Historian. In introduction Dr. Emme pointed out that 57 men had flown in space since October 1957, 10 had walked on lunar surface, 22 had flown around moon, and 2 (Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., and John W. Young) had traveled to moon twice and made two earth-orbiting flights. Papers presented included \u201cHungarian Rocketry in the 19th Century\u201d by Istvan G.

Atmospheric pressures of cabins would be adjusted while spacecraft were docked, to avoid necessity of prebreathing pure oxygen before transfer of crewmen from Soyuz to Apollo cabins. Soyuz pressure would be lowered from its normal 101 kilonewtons per sq m to 69 (from 14.7 psi to 10); Apollo pressure would remain at 35 kilonewtons per sq m (5 psi). First joint crew training session was scheduled for summer of 1973, with cosmonauts visiting U.S. for several weeks. Astronauts would train equal time in U.S.S.R. in fall of 1973. Soviet two-fifths scale model of docking mechanism would be tested with U.S. model during Moscow meeting in December 1972. Further consideration of extravehicular crew transfer would be deleted; if any emergency prevented return of crewmen to their own ships, they would land in spacecraft they were visiting. Sufficient propellant would be budgeted for Apollo spacecraft to allow it to maintain attitude control while docked. Exchange of working groups would be more frequent, with meetings at msc in November, in Moscow in December, and at msc in March 1973. U.S. delegation included representatives of prime contractor North American Rockwell Corp. and three of five working groups established in July 6-18 meetings at msc to define mission elements.

Same set of questions had been submitted to campaign organizations of Sen. George S. McGovern (D-S.D.) and of President Nixon. President Nixon said he would continue general pattern of previous years on Federal research and development funding; its division among defense, space, and civilian sectors; its possible link to gross national product (gnp) ; and appropriate balance for basic research, applied research, and development. Pattern would include increasingly effective program in civilian sector R&D, \u201cprudent space program, and a sufficient defense R&D budget.\u201d Administration believed r&d funding should be based on opportunities for effective programs and necessity for creating new opportunities through fundamental studies and that R&D resources, excepting basic research, should be allocated to areas that provided \u201cgreatest opportunity for leverage or that satisfy an immediate future need.\u201d Sen. McGovern recommended increased Federal R&D funding. Principal problem was \u201cgovernment spending that has masqueraded as R&D, yet has little technical content. For example, when an Apollo is launched ... all of the kerosene and liquid oxygen that it uses comes out of the federal R&D budget. Only a very small percentage of the federal R&D budget actually represents laboratory investigations, instrument design, feasibility studies, and other technical efforts that involve scientists and engineers.\u201d Sen. McGovern would emphasize civilian sector R&D and strong military R&D program as \u201cgood investment for long-term national security. My space program would emphasize unmanned planetary exploration and scientific satellites and also earth resource and communications satellites.\u201d Nixon Administration would continue to maintain \u201cstrong and up-to-date defense force\u201d and to capitalize upon past space investments. Both candidates recommended increased priority on developments of new energy sources. Nixon Administration was opposed to S. 32, reconversion bill introduced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to amend National Science Foundation Act of 1950 to establish framework of national science policy. Bill would focus policy and U.S. scientific talent and resources on Nation\u2019s priority problems. Administration believed segment of S. 32 that would establish independent agency within nsf was \u201cparticularly unwise\u201d because it would \u201cdivorce the R&D from the departments of Government responsible for using its results\u201d and \u201cwould divert attention from the primary mission of nsf\u2014to support fundamental and basic research.\u201d Sen. McGovern would continue to support S. 32. \u201cIn its original form, before compromise to get Republican support, it would have provided $1.2 billion for a new NASA-type Civil Science Systems Administration that would fund genuine r&d across a broad range of civilian technology needs.\u201d Administration did not believe in Cabinet-level science department or \u201csupra\u201d agency, nor that \u201cexisting science apparatus is totally adequate. As with all human and governmental institutions, it too should be dynamic and subject to change as conditions and events dictate.\u201d Sen. McGovern felt \u201cmore centralized federal science management and funding apparatus might be useful, but the key need is not to change the institutions but rather to give them more power in the Federal Government.\u201d He favored establishment of Office of Technology Assessment [see October 13] which would \u201cassess each new technical program with an eye toward cost efficiency and effectiveness, and domestic betterment.\u201d Asked if federally owned laboratories should be expanded to deal with problems of health and environment, Nixon Administration pointed out that NASA Centers were \u201cclosely involved with the R&D components of other federal agencies in an effort to solve pressing national problems.\u201d Sen. McGovern believed Federal laboratories and research facilities had \u201cplenty of problems in their immediate areas\u201d with which to cope. \u201cI have no intention of taking the easy route and putting them on safe subjects.\u201d (Chemical & Engineering News, 10/23/72, 14-19) October 23-27:\tConference on high-energy astrophysics was held at Cal Tech by division of American Astronomical Society. Dr. Kenneth I. Kellerman of National Radio Astronomy Observatory said most baffling phenomenon observed by radiotelescopes was speed at which objects seemed to be moving. If measurements taken in past two years were accepted at face value, objects associated with quasars were speeding away from each other faster than speed of light. Such speed had been considered impossible. Cal Tech astronomer Dr. W. L. W. Sargent said strange blue objects sighted in sky by Hale Observatory astronomers might be newly formed galaxies \u201cabout 100 million years old, and they seem to be made up of very young stars.\u201d Discovery indicated that galaxies might still be forming. Dr. Herbert Gursky of American Science and Engineering, Inc., said astronomers using Uhuru (Explorer 42 Small Astronomy Satellite launched by NASA Dec. 12, 1970) had spotted several x-ray objects that could not be detected by wavelengths other than x-ray. Impact of x-ray astronomy might be that \u201cthis new wavelength range may show some different aspects of stars and galaxies.\u201d Through x-ray astronomy scientists \u201chope to . . . learn something about these objects that radio and optical observations can\u2019t tell us.\u201d Evidence of black hole\u2014star whose gravity field was so strong that light could not escape from it\u2014in constellation Cygnus was reported by Dr. Kip Thorne of Cal Tech, Dr. J. P. Ostriker of Princeton Univ., and Dr. Riccardo Giacconi of American Science and Engineering. Evidence had come from photos taken at Hale Observatory that showed bright blue line near source Cygnus X-l and from data gathered by XJhuru (see also Sept. 2).

      "story": " Lunar science press conference at Manned Spacecraft Center discussed Apollo 16 data and portent for Apollo 17 mission, scheduled for launch Dec. 6. Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer of State Univ. of New York at Stony Brook reported that analysis of pea-size Apollo 16 rock fragments had shown them ranging in age from 3.98 billion to 4.25 billion yrs. Rocks had crystallized some 300 million yrs after moon\u2019s formation. It was possible that Apollo 17 site would yield \u201cvery young rocks . . . , young volcanics. So one may be able to extend the mare type ages . . . and see just how long it took the surface of the moon ... to crystallize before it was a rather hard crust . . . with very little, if any, igneous activity.\u201d Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg of Cal Tech reported Apollo 16 rock No. 65015 seemed to have undergone two distinct melting steps. Bulk of this \u201ctwo-history rock\u201d had 'crystallized 3.93 billion yrs ago but had retained some crystals that had been formed between 4.40 and 4.48 billion yrs ago. First crystallization probably had been associated with great heat during moon\u2019s formation but scientists had no clue to cause of second melting period and subsequent recrystallization. Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of msc Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said \u201cfundamental conclusion\u201d was evolving from new understanding of moon gained \u201clargely out of the Apollo program.\u201d Scientists \u201chave to now look at each individual planet and somehow or another infer its chemical composition.\u201d They were beginning to see chemically heterogeneous solar system. Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, Apollo 17 lunar module pilot, described Apollo 17 landing site in moon\u2019s Taurus-Littrow area on rim of Serenitatis Basin: \u201cIt\u2019s in that general geographic ring that resembles the Apennine front near where Apollo 15 landed. It has, however, some very distinctive characteristics .... There is no clear evidence that we are close to mare. The nearest obvious mare surface is several hundred kilometers [100 km equals 62 mi] to the . . . northwest\u2014in the Mare Serenitatis. We are landing on a plain that seems to overlie a slightly elevated flat surface that predates the mare. And it seems when you look at all of the basins on the moon, that that surface, a correlative surface in other basins, is somehow related to the formation of the basin. There are comparable plains around all of the big circular basins, and there is a flat floor that predates the mare that is cut by graben faulting .... Also in the site we have the . . . north and south massifs. These are large aggregates of peaks and mountains that . . . are part of the range structure of the Orientale basin.\u201d Dark cover over valley floor and portions of highlands was younger than mare and was as little as 0.5 m (1.6 ft) thick. Radar data had shown cover was \u201cfinely fragmented mantle material\u201d that was \u201cubiquitous in all of the low areas and locally is covering portions of the highlands.\u201d Dr. Schmitt said mantle, although of not as high a priority as the crustal examination in the south massif, had \u201cpotential of giving us our most fundamental evidence for studying this evolutionary model.\u201d Potential was high that \u201cdark mantle material has sampled some significant portion of the crust. At least it has sampled its source area, and that source area is very probably deep within the moon.\u201d Dr. Schmitt told press that to be able to say that man was \u201con the verge, if not already there, of understanding the evolution of another planet is something that is really unprecedented in the history of man. And I think that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s the news of Apollo. That is what we have done.\u201d (Transcript)",

Initial analysis of data collected by Mars 2 and 3 (launched May 19 and May 28, 1971) spacecraft during interplanetary flight had indicated large variations in composition of interplanetary plasma ions at 20 million km (12.5 million mi) from earth. Data had also revealed new information on distribution of solar plasma around solar system and its relationship with interplanetary and terrestrial magnetic fields. No magnetic field had been detected near Mars, indicating possible lack of liquid core. Orbits of spacecraft had been selected to cover areas of Martian surface difficult to investigate from earth-central latitudes of southern hemisphere to 65° south, equatorial zone, and northern hemisphere to 29° north. During Martian orbit infrared radiometer data had shown certain areas of surface to be definitely warmer than immediate surroundings, indicating possible volcanic activity. Mars 2 and 3 had found steam content in Martian atmosphere to be 2000 times less than that existing in terrestrial atmosphere. At times precipitated water could be 50 micrometers; at others, less than 10. Since photos taken by NASA\u2019s Mariner 9 revealed impressive valleys which could have been formed by erosion, Soviet scientists had theorized that higher temperatures and pressures, sufficient to produce water in liquid form, existed on Mars in previous era. Very sharp differences in planet\u2019s brightness, never before observed from earth, were observed by visible range photometer. Data were collected from measurement of radio-wave reflection. After landing, scientific results from Mars 2 and 3 had been meager. Mars 2 had hardlanded a capsule on Mars Nov. 27, 1971. Photos and measurements by Mars 3 (which softlanded a capsule Dec. 2, 1971) had indicated a dust cloud 6 to 8 km (4 to 5 mi) thick covering landing area, leading to speculation that either dust storms had raged over area and caused capsule to land incorrectly or capsule had sunk into dust layer. Soviet Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov had said U.S.S.R. planned to use 1973 launch windows if program of Martian exploration continued as planned.

Ichtiaque Rasool, Deputy Director of Planetary Programs, in telephone interview. NASA also released Mariner 9 photos of sites-\u2014 two at edge of Nix. Olympics slopes, another near slopes of three smaller volcanoes north of canyons along Martian equator, fourth on desert plain, and fifth in region of flattened craters at edge of highland terrain. Observations from Mariner 9 (launched May 30, 1971) had shown sites were low, relatively warm regions, possibly moist, where life form was most likely to be discovered. Prime objective of Viking missions was to determine if Mars harbored life or potential for life. In choosing sites, project scientists had eliminated nearly one third of Mars because of high elevations. In mountainous regions, Viking parachutes would not have sufficient atmosphere to brake spacecraft descent. Scientists also had rejected areas where surface appeared too soft for spacecraft landing, too hard for retrieval of soil samples, or so steep that spacecraft might tip over on landing. Attention had centered November 6:\tSelection of five potential landing sites on Mars for mass's two unmanned Viking spacecraft in 1976 was announced. The map showing the sites was based on photos televised from Mariner 9, launched May 30, 1971, and in orbit around Mars since Nov. 13, 1972. All the sites were fairly smooth areas near scientifically interesting geological features and were in regions of the planet where warmer temperatures and greater likelihood of water increased chances of finding evidence of life. The first map of the entire globe of Mars, prepared by the VS. Geological Survey from 1500 of 7000 photos taken by Mariner 9, was published Nov. 27. on broad Mars equatorial band with brightest sunlight and highest temperatures, which increased chance of finding water vapor in atmosphere and thus of finding biological activity. Landing zones were about 65 km (40 mi) wide and 650 km (400 mi) long. Precise sites would be selected after further analysis of Mariner 9 photos. U.S. and Soviet scientists 'would meet during winter to compare Mars landing targets. There was \u201cno use in landing on top of each- other.

Baltimore Sun on post-Apollo space program: \u201cWhile it is tempting to contemplate what improvements could be financed here on earth from the billions being spent in space, it is well to bear several factors in mind. One is the decline in space spending from a $5.25 billion peak in 1965 to the present plateau of $3.35 billion a year. Another is the Nixon administration\u2019s decision to proceed cautiously on the rush-rush manned Mars expedition advocated by Vice President Agriew three years ago. Still another is the American-Soviet agreement on a rendezvous-and-docking mission for mid-1975, a concept once relegated to political science fiction. Finally, there is the very real prospect that experiments and programs conducted from space shuttles will be of use in improving the environment on earth. More accurate weather forecasting, air pollution studies, better communications\u2014these are some of the more obvious opportunities. These trends surely justify reasonable financial support to continue a desired momentum in space technology.\u201d (B Sun, 12/3/72) New York News on last Apollo mission: \u201cThe Apollo program is being phased out before its time, a victim of what we consider false economy, and the horizon is barren of any prospect for manned exploration beyond the boundaries of Earth orbit. Even unmanned probes will be few and far between as things look now.\u201d (NY News, 12/3/72)\t_ # Chicago Tribune on future space program: Cost of Skylab, Viking, and space shuttle programs would £e far less than amount put into space since 1958. \u201cThe national priorities have been reordered and, we believe, properly so. Future space exploration should be a part of, but should not dominate, our national effort to improve the lot of Americans.\u201d (C Trib, 12/3/72) December 4:\tTechnicians at Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Apollo 17 launch site loaded helium used to pressurize lunar craft\u2019s descent rocket system.

The thousands of men and women who have participated in the Apollo program, and the American people who supported it, have all cause for great pride in Apollo. It has been one of the best investments this country ever made, one of the most rewarding adventures it ever undertook.\u201d (LA Times, 12/6/72) Christian Science Monitor: \u201cTo the layman, what has been learned about the moon and space has been an extension of our knowledge of the universe, not a radical departure.

Some consider the moon landings the most brilliant scientific achievement in history; others still look at the whole venture as a waste of resources needed for urgent requirements here on earth. Yet one fact about the venture is beyond dispute: in the years 1969-72 men landed on another celestial body for the first time and showed they could live and work in the bizarre and literally inhuman conditions on that foreign planet. Long after most other developments of the twentieth century are forgotten, future generations will recall this as the century in which men broke the bonds of terrestrial gravity and began their cosmic destiny.\u201d (NYT, 12/6/72, 42) Spacecraft\u2014carrying Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan (commander), Ronald E. Evans (command module pilot), and Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt (lunar module pilot and geologist)\u2014was launched at 12:33 am EST Dec. 7, with illumination from S-IC 1st stage creating brilliance of morning sun. Liftoff, witnessed by crowd estimated at 500 000 and by nationwide and foreign TV viewers, was visible to naked eye as far as South Carolina to north and Cuba to south. Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with 170-km (105.6-mi) apogee and 168-km (104.4-mi) perigee. Following checkout, spacecraft was inserted into trajectory lor moon at 3:13 ground elapsed time (get) as planned, csm separation from lm/S-IVB/iu at 3:42 GET and docking with lm at 3:57 get were shown on TV. During docking possible ring latch malfunction was indicated. Troubleshooting revealed latches 7, 9, and 10 were unlocked. Latch 10 was locked by pushing on handle; latches 7 and 9 were locked and manually fired to lock handles. Following hatch replacement, csm/lm combination was ejected from S-IVB stage at 4:45 get. S-IVB lunar impact maneuver targeted stage to strike moon\u2019s surface Dec. 10. Midcourse correction (MCC-1) was not necessary because of nominal trajectory. MCC\u20142 maneuver was performed on time at 35:30 get, changing velocity 3 m per sec (9.9 fps). Cernan and Schmitt entered LM at 40:10 get and discovered docking latch 4 improperly latched. Evans moved latch handle 30°^t5°, disengaging hook from docking ring. Mission Control and flight crew decided to wait until second LM entering at 59:59 get for further action on latch. Remainder of LM housekeeping was nominal and LM was closed out at 42:11 GET. Heat flow and convection demonstrations were conducted as planned; results were satisfactory. MCC-3 and -4 were not required because of near-nominal trajectory. LM housekeeping was resumed at 59:59 get and completed at 62:16 get with all systems nominal. Evans, following ground instructions, stroked docking latch 4 handle and succeeded in cocking latch. Latch was left in cocked position for csm-lm rendezvous. Planned trajectory was modified continually because of late liftoff; coast toward moon was accelerated to ensure arrival of spacecraft at lunar orbit insertion (loi) at scheduled GMT time. GET clock was updated 2 hrs 40 min at 65:00 get to place all events on original flight plan schedule. Crew began one-hour visual-light-flash phenomenon observation at 68:19 GET and reported seeing bright to dull light flashes. Cernan reported continuing gas pains during private consultation via separate radio link with Dr. W. Royee Hawkins, Manned Spacecraft Center Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations. He was told to continue taking antigas pills and to alter diet. Crew jettisoned scientific instrument module (sim) door at 84:12 GET and said SIM bay looked good. S-IVB 3rd stage impacted on lunar surface at 89:39 GET (3:32 pm EST Dec. 10) at 4° 12' south latitude and 12° 18' west longitude. Impact was recorded by Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 seismometers.

CSM and LM undocked and separated on schedule at 107:48 get. Circularization maneuver placed csm in orbit with 129-km (80.2-mi) apolune and 100-km (62.1-mi) perilune. DOI-2, at 109:50 get, inserted lm into orbit with 111-km (69.0-mi) apolune and 11-km (6.8-mi) perilune. Powered descent was initiated and Challenger touched down on Taurus-Littrow site at 113:02 get (2:55 pm est Dec. 11). Cernan descended lm ladder four hours later, at 117:02 get, and said: \u201cAs I step off at the surface at Taurus-Littrow, I\u2019d like to dedicate the first step of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible.\u201d Schmitt, first geologist to walk on moon, followed and asked, \u201cHey, who\u2019s been tracking up my lunar surface?\u201d Cernan said surrounding hills looked like \u201cwrinkled skin of an old, old, 100-year-old man.\u201d Astronauts deployed lunar roving vehicle. Cernan made short test drive and said, \u201cHallelujah, Houston! Challenger\u2019s baby is on the roll.\u201d As Cernan and Schmitt set up TV equipment, Cernan called to Schmitt: \u201cHey, Jack, just stop. You owe yourself 30 seconds to look up over the South Massif and look at the Earth.\u201d Schmitt replied: \u201cWhat? The Earth? You seen one earth, you\u2019ve seen them all.\u201d Cernan unfurled U.S. flag on lunar surface while Schmitt took his picture. Cernan said, \u201cIt\u2019s got to be one of the most proud moments of my life.\u201d Flag had \u201cflown in the mocr [Mission Operations Control Room] since Apollo 11. And we very proudly deploy it on the Moon, to stay for as long as it can, in honor of all those people who have worked so hard to put us here and to put every other crew here and to make the country, the United States and mankind, something different than it was.\u201d While preparing to traverse to Apollo lunar surface experiment package site, Cernan inadvertently knocked extension off of lrv right rear fender and repairs were made with tape. Astronauts crossed to alsep site, where they deployed alsep. Color TV camera beamed live telecast to earth. LRV fender again fell off during traverse to Steno Crater, lunar station 1A. Crew deployed surface electrical properties experiment and explosive packages during 7-hr 12-min lunar surface exploration. First eva ended at 124:13 get. Second eva began 1 hr 20 min late, at 140:35 get (6:28 pm est Dec. 12). Cernan and Schmitt, on instructions from Mission Control, improvised replacement for lost lrv fender extension. Four chronopaque maps were taped together and held in place by two portable utility lamp clamps. \u201cCall me the little old fender maker,\u201d Cernan said. Cernan and Schmitt visited lunar stations 2, 2A, 3, 4, and 5. They deployed explosive packages, obtained photos, and collected and documented soil samples. At station 4, Shorty Crater, Schmitt shouted: \u201cThere is orange soil! It\u2019s all over! Orange!\u201d Cernan confirmed finding: \u201cJack that is really orange. It\u2019s been oxidized.\u201d Schmitt dug trench and extracted sample which he described to Mission Control: \u201cAn essential portion of the zone . . . actually has a crimson hue, or red hue. Outside of that it\u2019s orange. And outside of that, it\u2019s gray.\u201d Scientists on ground immediately speculated that soil might have originated from volcanism on moon as recently as 100 million yrs earlier. If so, it would contradict \u201cdead moon\u201d theory that moon had always been cold and inert. Dr. Robin P. Brett, head of MSC Geochemistry Branch, told press, \u201cWhat we have been witnessing may be one of the most significant finds of Apollo geology.\u201d Schmitt revisited ALSEP site to verify that lunar surface gravimeter had been leveled properly. EVA-2 ended at 148:35 get (2:05 am EST Dec. 13), after 7 hrs 37 min. Total distance covered during second eva was 19 km (12 mi). Third eva began 50 min late at 163:35 GET (5:26 pm est Dec. 13). Cosmic ray detector was retrieved before start of traverse to prevent exposure to low-energy solar protons from small solar flare. Cernan and Schmitt took black and white and color photos and collected 66 kg (145.9 lbs) of samples. Samples included blue-gray breccias, finegrained vesicular basalts, crushed anorthositic rocks, and soils. EVA-3 ended at 170:48 get {0:41 am est Dec. 14), after 7 hrs 16 min. During EVA\u20143 Evans, orbiting in CSM 113 km (70 mi) above lunar surface, identified series of volcanic domes in Aitken Grater, on moon\u2019s far side. Before entering Challenger for last time, Cernan and Schmitt stepped before TV cameras. Cernan said: \u201cTo commemorate not just Apollo ITs visit to the Valley of Taurus-Littrow but as an everlasting commemoration of what the real meaning of Apollo is to the world, we\u2019d like to uncover a plaque that has been on the leg of our spacecraft.\u201d He read inscription: \u201cHere man completed his first exploration of the Moon, December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind.\u201d Dr, James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, congratulated astronauts from Mission Control at msc and conveyed Godspeed message from President Nixon. As astronauts boarded LM, Cernan said: \u201cI believe history will record that America\u2019s challenge of today has forged man\u2019s destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind.

Solar array lock-on and three-axis stabilization were achieved as planned. Activation was proceeding. Nimbus 5 carried new and improved instruments to extend observation into cloudy areas and higher altitudes, making first vertical temperature and water vapor measurements through clouds of earth\u2019s atmosphere. Assigned primary objectives were to improve and extend capability for vertical sounding of temperature and moisture in atmosphere with particular regard to altitude coverage and cloud interference, providing nearly total global coverage for first time, and to demonstrate improved thermal mapping for 10 wks. As secondary objectives spacecraft would determine feasibility of using passive microwave remote sensing techniques to obtain earth observational data and would demonstrate capabilities of improved selective chopper radiometer (scr), provided by United Kingdom, to obtain atmospheric soundings. Butterfly-shaped 769-kg (1695-lb) satellite carried six meteorological and earth resources experiments: scr; infrared temperature profile radiometer (itpr) ; Nimbus E microwave spectrometer (nems) ; electrically scanning microwave radiometer (esmr) ; surface-compositionmapping radiometer (scmr) ; and temperature-humidity infrared radiometer (thir). Nimbus 5 was sixth of seven spacecraft designed to provide atmospheric data for improved weather forecasting. With added sophistication program had grown to include wide range of earth sciences. Sensors aboard Nimbus 5 would map Gulf Stream off east coast of U.S. and Humboldt Current off west coast of South America. By knowing locations of streams, shipping interests could make substantial saving. Nimbus 5 would also provide information about El Nino\u2014 change in Humboldt Current. El Nino had been causing great economic damage by warming coastal waters, killing nutrients and fish. Nimbus 2 (launched May 15, 1966, with design life of 6 mos) had returned data for 32 mos, for detailed study of effect of water, carbon dioxide, and ozone on earth\u2019s heat balance. Vertical temperature measurements of Nimbus 3 (launched April 14, 1969) had been termed by meteorologists as one of most significant events in meteorological history, providing worldwide atmospheric information.

December 16:\tApollo 17 surface science press briefing was held at Manned Spacecraft Center as astronauts headed toward home from moon. Stanford Univ. seismologist Dr. Robert L. Kovach described results to date from lunar seismic profiling experiment. Experiment had recorded impact of lunar module (lm) on lunar surface 9 km (5.6 mi) southwest of landing site \u201cright on target where we wanted it.\u201d Kinetic energy at impact was comparable to \u201c1 ton of tnt going off.\u201d Signal was \u201cvery clearly recorded on the geophone array and we\u2019ve acquired an extremely important data point; . . . we\u2019re effectively getting a depth sample down to 3 to 4 kilometers [1.9 to 2.5 miles] in the Moon. And ... we should get some very important information about the underlying highland type materials.\u201d Data point was \u201cin critical distance range to answer one of the mysteries . . . of the shallow Lunar interior. We\u2019ve been very much concerned about the enormous change in physical properties by terrestrial standards, . . . velocity changes by enormous percentage over a very small pressure range.\u201d Data point should provide \u201canswers as to just how these properties are changing.\u201d First two explosive charges deployed had not shown significant differences in subsurface of Apollo 17 landing site and those of Apollo 15 and 16 but Apollo 17 site appeared to be \u201cunderlined by definitely more competent materials and they quite probably could be volcanic flows.\u201d Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal investigator for passive seismic experiment, said Apollo 17 data, when compared with previous data, suggested possibility of new interpretation of lunar structure. \u201cWe do find evidence for lunar crust as we did in the past, but we may have to thin it considerably.\u201d Velocity of seismic waves in crustal material and velocity of material underlying crust might also have to be lowered. \u201cWe\u2019re not dealing with pure anorthosite anymore. We\u2019re dealing perhaps with gabbros . . . and so we have ... to review all of the data and to reconsider our interpretations some, not just the seismologist, but the geochemist and geologist, as well.\u201d Dr. Marcus E. Langseth of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, principal investigator for heat flow experiment, said Apollo 17 experiment had \u201cmore than doubled\u201d lunar heat flow data to date. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very successful emplacement in the operation of our instrument. It has been perfect.\u201d Lunar surface temperature recorded Dec. 14 had been about 360 K (189°F). At about 15 cm (6 in), it had dropped to 280 K (45°F). At about 65 cm (26 in) temperature dropped to 254 K (\u20142°F). \u201cBelow that depth, the temperature begins to increase again. It\u2019s about 257 degrees [3°F] at the bottom of the probes.\u201d Data indicated that heat flow at Apollo 17 site would resemble that observed at 15 cm (6 in). If so, it would \u201cgive support to the kind of growing model of a warmer interior to the Moon\u201d and \u201cwould require that there be a total gradient abundance of radioactive isotopes in the Moon as compared to Earth. So, there would be implication here for fundamental difference in composition, between the Moon and the Earth.\u201d Dr. Langseth also reported data from traverse gravimeter experiment had supported thesis that \u201chigh gravity anomalies associated with the mare basin\u2014the so called mascons\u201d\u2014probably had been created by slab of basalt or lavas which had flooded into previously excavated basins. Dr. William R. Muehlberger of Univ. of Texas, principal lunar geology investigator, said Apollo 17 had provided \u201cmost exciting few days of my scientific career. This mission is truly the fitting climax to the whole Apollo program. The landing site held great promise that we were going to get a good chance to unravel much of the earlier lunar history as well as the sample and study of what appeared to be very young vulcanism .... And I think this promise was fulfilled.\u201d Orange materials at Shorty Crater had been \u201ca spectacular plus.\u201d Scientists hoped \u201creturned material will tell us that that was young vulcanism in volcanic alteration of Shorty Crater. There\u2019s still a possibility it could be an impact crater, however.\u201d Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of MSC Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., discussed Dr. Latham\u2019s suggestion that lunar crust might be thinner than originally expected: \u201cI will certainly defend the proposition that the crust is made of a very aluminum plagioclase-rich rocks, . . . anorthosite gabbro or gabbroic anorthosite, . . . far from a basalt. I think that the chemistry of the surface rocks, . . . and the returned rocks bear this out and if the crust is thin, it reduces the likelihood that it is any different composition than what we see at the surface.\u201d (Transcript)",

So, hopefully, we will have the rectification of 17 done shortly and put out a series of photomosaics, putting the high-resolution panoramic frames together into what we think will be the best series of maps that we have developed for the Moon.\u201d Correlation of photography with gravity tracking and laser altimetry had produced \u201ca great deal of data\u201d to confirm earlier interpretations from Apollo 15 that lunar front side was low and that \u201clargest area of mare material on the front side is an ocean basin floor, . . . not a result of the impact as the large gravity anomalies indicate in the impact basin.\u201d Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist Walter E. Brown reported lunar sounder experiment had \u201cbehaved about as we expected except that there were a couple of surprises.\u201d Experimenters had expected that \u201cover the Mare, the smooth areas, . . . we\u2019d have a reasonably smooth, well-behaved echo, and over the mountainous area it might bounce around a little bit.\u201d Sounder data had shown \u201cit was fairly smooth over the mountains and it bounced around over the Mare.\u201d Until mission film was returned, \u201cwe won\u2019t know . . . just exactly what is going on, but it\u2019s . . . extremely interesting.\u201d Dr. Frank J. Low of Univ. of Arizona and Rice Univ. said scanning radiometer experiment performance \u201cwas essentially perfect.\u201d It produced coverage of about one third of the surface area of the moon and made some 100 million independent temperature measurements. With \u201cbeautiful Atlas of thermal measurements generated by this magnificent flight,\u201d scientists had \u201cfoundation of a new technique for exploration of planetary surfaces without atmospheres.\u201d Johns Hopkins Univ. scientist William E. Fastie said far-ultraviolet spectrometer had \u201cperformed perfectly . . . and all of the observations that were intended were accomplished.\u201d Experiment had detected neither major nor minor constituents of atmosphere. \u201cAnd, pending further analysis, we have . . . identified only one trace constituent of the lunar atmosphere. The immediate conclusion ... is, that the Moon is not outgassing, because the only other possible gases that could be in the lunar atmosphere are neon and argon, and neither of them are the primordial atmosphere of the Moon.\u201d Mood of briefing was conveyed by Apollo orbital science program scientist Floyd I. Roberson: \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a lot of tools in our hands now and we sit up here and we\u2019re all tired and we talk about the results of our experiments and maybe we don\u2019t convey the excitement that\u2019s upon us. But, we really feel that this is a beginning as far as lunar science is concerned, as far as the Apollo data is concerned, and we\u2019re really going to get there now.\u201d (Transcript)",

      "story": " President Nixon issued statement on U.S. space program following splashdown of Apollo 17 command module: \u201cThe safe return of the command module America marks the end of one of the most significant chapters in the history of human endeavor. In October 1958, this Nation set about sending men into a hostile, unknown environment. We had little idea what lay before us, but there was new knowledge to be gained and there was a heritage of meeting historical challenge\u2014 the challenge of greatness\u2014to be sustained. Project Mercury, begun in 1958, taught us that man could survive and work in space. In 1961, President Kennedy voiced the determination of the United States to place a mem on the moon. We gained the understanding and the technology to embark on this great mission through Project Gemini and we accomplished it with the Apollo lunar exploration series. In 1969, for the first time, men from the planet Earth set foot on the moon. \u201cSince the beginning of Apollo, nine manned flights have been made to the moon. Three circled that nearest neighbor in the universe, six landed and explored its surface. We have barely begun to evaluate the vast treasure store of extraterrestrial data and material from these voyages, but we have already learned much and we know that we are probing our very origins. We are taking another long step in man\u2019s ancient search for his own beginnings, pressing beyond knowledge of the means of human existence to find, perhaps, the meaning of human existence. \u201cNor is this great work ending with the return of Gene Cernan, Jack Schmitt, and Ron Evans from the moon today. Rather it has barely begun. As Sir Isaac Newton attributed his accomplishments to the fact that he stood \u2018upon the shoulders of Giants,\u2019 so Newton himself is one of the giants upon whose shoulders we now stand as we reach for the stars. The great mathematician once wrote: \u2018I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\u2019 I believe we have finally moved into the great ocean and we are trying now to understand what surrounds us. \u201cThe making of space history will continue, and this Nation means to play a major role in its making. Next spring, the Sky lab will be put into orbit. It will be aimed not at advancing exploration of deep space, but at gaining in space new knowledge for the improvement of life here on earth. It will help develop new methods of learning about the earth\u2019s environment and the earth\u2019s resources, and new methods of evaluating programs aimed at preserving and enhancing the resources of all the world. It will seek new knowledge about our own star, the sun, and about its tremendous influence on our environment. Scientists aboard the Skylab will perform medical experiments aimed at a better knowledge of man\u2019s own physiology. Also, they will perform experiments aimed at developing new industrial processes utilizing the unique capabilities found in space. Skylab will be our first manned space station. It will be in use for the better part of a year, permitting the economy of extended usage, and laying the groundwork for further space stations. \u201cEconomy in space will be further served by the Space Shuttle .... It will enable us to ferry space research hardware into orbit without requiring the full expenditure of a launch vehicle as is necessary today. It will permit us to place that hardware in space accurately, and to serve or retrieve it when necessary instead of simply writing it off in the event it malfunctions or fails. In addition, the Shuttle will provide such routine access to space that for the first time personnel other than trained astronauts will be able to participate and contribute in space as will nations once excluded for economic reasons. \u201cThe near future will see joint space efforts by this Nation and the Soviet Union in an affirmation of our common belief that the hopes and the needs that unite our people and all people are of greater consequence than the differences in philosophy that divide us. \u201cFinally, we will continue to draw knowledge from the universe through the use of unmanned satellites and probes. \u201cWe cannot help but pause today and remember and pay homage to those many men and women\u2014including those who made the ultimate sacrifice\u2014whose hopes, whose energies, skill, and courage enabled the first man to reach the moon and who now have seen with us perhaps the last men in this century leave the moon. But the more we look back the more we are reminded that our thrust has been forward and that our place is among the heavens where our dreams precede us, and where, in time, we shall surely follow. \u201cThough our ancestors would have called the deeds of Apollo miraculous, we do not see our age as an age of miracles. Rather, we deal in facts, we deal in scientific realities, we deal in industrial capacity, and technological expertise, and in the belief that men can do whatever they turn their hands to. For all this, however, can we look at the record of 24 men sent to circle the moon or to stand upon it, and 24 men returned to earth alive and well, and not see God\u2019s hand in it? \u201cPerhaps, in spite of ourselves, we do still live in an Age of Miracles. So if there is self-congratulation, let it be tempered with awe, and our pride with prayer, and as we enter this special time of spiritual significance, let us reserve a moment to wonder at what human beings have done in space and to be grateful.\u201d {PD, 12/25/72, 1788-9)",

Hundreds of pounds of lunar rock and soil are now ... on earth, available for study, while instruments planted on the moon give daily reports of lunar conditions, and will do so for years.

M2-F3 lifting body completed 27th and last scheduled flight in joint NASA and Air Force program begun July 12, 1966. During 14 lifting-body flights in 1972, maximum speed of 1718 km per hr (1066 mph) and maximum altitude of 21 800 m (17 500 ft) were attained. In aeronautics, Flight Research Center celebrated 25th anniversary of its creation in 1947 as Muroc Flight Test Unit of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. NASA TF-8A jet aircraft with supercritical wing was flown in configuration planned for future flights. Digital fly-by-wire computerized control system was demonstrated in series of flights from frc. System, for potential use in space shuttle, enhanced aircraft handling and reduced pilot workload. NASA awarded contract to refine design of quiet, jet, propulsive-lift, experimental aircraft QUESTOL in major effort to develop technology for short takeoff and landing (stol) aircraft to relieve airport congestion. Progress was made in quiet jet engine, techniques to reduce aircraft emissions, composite materials, avionics, aerodynamics including supercritical and antisymmetrical wings, general-aviation safety, supersonic and hypersonic research, and research in basic materials and structures. In sounding rocket program, more than 80 successful flights were made to study atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomagnetic storms, meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations; to make astronomical observations in x-ray, ultraviolet, and radio regions of electromagnetic spectrum; for special projects; and for support. NASA flew 61 balloon flights in its program to study near-earth phenomena, including balloon that lifted 545 kg (1200 lbs) of scientific equipment to 45 000-m (148 000-ft) altitude. U.S.S.R. launches decreased from record 83 in 1971 to 74. The 89 payloads included 72 Cosmos satellites, 3 Intercosmos, 1 Luna, 3 Meteor, 2 Prognoz, 3 Molniya I, 3 Molniya II, 1 Venus, and secondary payload Sret 1 (launched for France). Japan launched Denpa Radio Explorer Satellite.

      "story": " President Nixon\u2019s January decision to proceed with development of reusable space shuttle keyed transition in U.S. space program from space exploration to space exploitation for practical and immediate benefits to mankind. While budget restrictions and national emphasis of technology applications to improve conditions on earth brought early end to Apollo program, U.S.-U.S.S.R. space agreement opened new era of international space cooperation. Agreement inspired intensive planning for 1975 joint rendezvous and docking mission of Soviet Salyut and U.S. Apollo spacecraft in orbit. Apollo program\u2014major drive of U.S. space program since 1961, triumphantly concluded in 1972\u2014had begun to give clear picture of moon, how it had evolved and its relationship to sun and earth, and would contribute to understanding of how earth had evolved. Apollo program had also given man new awareness of earth and had given Americans self-confidence in ability to achieve gigantic goal. During 1972\tASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972 Picture of a manned spaceship ... (courtesy of NASA) During 1972: Conclusion of the Apollo program was commemorated by Scott Long\u2019s cartoon, published in the Minneapolis Tribune Dec, 6, The maimed lunar explorations had given man a new awareness of the earth and the need to preserve it, as well as a wealth of information on the moon and possible origins of the earth and solar system. New space program for 1970s was designed to be funded at constant budget level over several years\u2014yet to maintain space flight capability, contribute to national security, increase opportunities for new scientific knowledge, encourage international cooperation, address problems of society and environment, and continue U.S. leadership in aeronautics. Reusable shuttle was expected to give \u201croutine access to space\u201d by cutting complexity and cost of launches and multiplying uses of satellites. It could be used for both manned and unmanned missions and, in military use, could serve national security. Revision of NASA FY 1972 program to phase in new programs while holding expenditures to $3.4-billion budget level required basic changes in planning. Further stretch-out of period over which NASA long-term objectives in space and science could be achieved was necessary. Shuttle configuration costs were pared to about half of original cost estimate; plans for Grand Tour missions to explore all five outer planets in late 1970s were cut back to focus on Jupiter and Saturn with less expensive spacecraft; and NASA and Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (nerva) program was terminated. Emphasis on aeronautics was increased at urging of congressional committees, but $44.9 million of $50.5-million NASA FY 1973 appropriation for aircraft noise suppression program, engine retrofit studies, and quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (questol) aircraft program was impounded by Office of Management and Budget. Tight NASA funding and end of Apollo program brought reductions in personnel, especially at manned space-flight Centers. NASA total in-house personnel decreased by 1181 from Dec. 31, 1971, to 27 801 persons Dec. 31, 1972, with further cuts scheduled for 1973. Marshall Space Flight Center employment was reduced by 258, to 5501 persons; Manned Space Center 159, to 3882; and Kennedy Space Center 123, to 2518. Employment in aerospace industry throughout the Nation also declined slightly, from 924 000 workers at end of 1971 to 917 000 at end of 1972, despite infusion of space shuttle program. Aerospace industry remained largest manufacturing employer, however, and industry sales increased for first time since 1968. To emphasize transition from Apollo to Skylab and shuttle activities, NASA established new Mission and Payload Integration Office within Office of Manned Space Flight. Space Station Task Force became Sortie Lab Task Force. Apollo Program Office became Apollo/ASTP Office to prepare for 1975 U.S.\u2014Soviet mission. Office of Advanced Research and Technology (oart) was renamed Office of Aeronautical and Space Technology (oast) to emphasize increasing NASA aeronautical activity. Office of Applications had been separated from Office of Space Science at end of 1971 to increase emphasis on use of space technology for benefits on earth. Charles W. Mathews, Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight since 1968, headed new Office of Applications. Dr. Wernher von Braun retired as NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning to become Corporate Vice President for Engineering and Development at Fairchild Industries, Inc., after more than quarter of century as leader of space rocket development in the U.S. His NASA career had begun in 1960 when his Army Ballistic Missile Agency team\u2014which had launched first U.S. satellite, Explorer I in 1958\u2014was transferred to form nucleus of Marshall Space Flight Center. Dr. von Braun had served as MSFC Director from 1960 to 1970, where Saturn V launch vehicle for Apollo moon missions was his major engineering achievement. In technology utilization, NASA continued to distribute information about aerospace technology to private and public sectors of national economy at ever-increasing rate. NASA-developed technology was being used in medicine, nondestructive testing, and engineering design. NASTRAN computer program to analyze structures under stress was used by more than 70 industrial firms, universities, laboratories, and government agencies to solve structural engineering problems. Technology and interpretive systems developed by NASA in cooperation with other agencies prepared way for worldwide environmental pollution and monitoring network. NASA FY 1973 appropriation of $3,408 billion was equivalent to budget request and $110 million above FY 1972 appropriation of $3,298 billion. Increase reflected funds for design and development of space shuttle. (A&A 1972; Fletcher testimony, 2/28/73; aia Aerospace, 3/73; NASA Pocket Statistics, 3/72, 1/73)",
