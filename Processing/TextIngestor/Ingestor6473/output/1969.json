Describing 10-day mission scheduled to begin Feb. 28 as primarily engineering evaluation of lunar module, McDivitt said: \u201c. . . we will be giving the . . . lm hardware a very close scrutiny. We don\u2019t expect to find anything, but our job is to go up there and look for it. Now after we have discovered that the lm is a good vehicle, we have ... to prove the joint operations techniques that we\u2019ve tried to develop on the ground over the last 3 years. It\u2019s one thing to fly one spacecraft in orbit, and have it controlled by the ground, but when you get 2 of them up there, they are trying to look at 2 vehicles simultaneously so that . . . you find the ground talking to 2 spacecraft and 2 spacecraft talking back to each other and also to the ground, and it becomes a rather unwieldly communications effort.\u201d He added reminder that \u201conly one of these vehicles has the capability to land\u2014 safely, I guess I should add. They both have the capability of landing. We only have one set of parachutes and one heat shield.\u201d He described lm as \u201ca tissue paper spacecraft,\u201d explaining it did not have to reenter earth\u2019s atmosphere and there was no atmosphere on moon. Scott said they now had \u201ca new vehicle ... a command module lm combination ... a particularly unique situation, in that ... we have to do the lunar orbit insertion [in lunar mission] with the two vehicles joined together with a very large mass on the end of the command module, so it\u2019s a completely new guidance task\u201d to be checked out. McDivitt explained separation of lm from cm on rendezvous day, with two vehicles pulling away from each other and performing maneuvers, moving up to 100 mi apart: \u201cThe object ... is to evaluate our systems from a propulsion standpoint, electrical standpoint, the staging sequence, all of the components that we can and still get back safely to the command module.\u201d In response to question on relation of Apollo program to life on earth, McDivitt replied: \u201c. . . if you\u2019re not moving forward ... the rest of the world is and they\u2019re going to pass you by.

Clarke said: \u201cThe Apollo 8 mission marks one of those rare turning points in human history after which nothing will ever be the same again. The immense technical achievement is already obvious to every one and has been universally praised; yet the psychological impact may be even more important and will take some time to make itself fully felt. We no longer live in the world which existed before Christmas 1968. It has passed away as irrevocably as the earth-centered universe of the Middle Ages.\u201d Dr. Rabi said: \u201cIt would be misleading to talk of the events that led to the journey of Apollo 8 in terms of the vast sums of money that are involved, even though it cost several times as much as the development of the first atomic bomb. What is more important and more impressive is that Apollo 8 represents the cooperation of hundreds of thousands of people over a period of years in a gigantic effort with no clearly set practical goals, except perhaps the profound desire of mankind to prove to itself that it had the knowledge and the ability to overcome its earthbound limitations.\u201d Prof. Dewart said: \u201cMan has taken his first, halting steps into the cosmos beyond that earthly world in which he was born and within which he had always lived. The impact of Apollo 8 in other areas of human experience is obvious; in religion, it is much less immediately evident.

Later he said aircraft was \u201ca pilot\u2019s dream\u201d which could be \u201cflown with two fingers\u201d and indicated flap misalignment would not delay further testing. The 210-ft-long 747 used only 4,500 ft of runway to become airborne at 170 mph. Spectators were impressed with quietness of its engines. (W Post, 2/10/69, 1; AP, W Star, 2/10/69, A5)",

      "story": " Thomas O\u2019Toole in Washington Post observed similarities among astronauts. Of 23 who already had flown in space, 21 were either only sons or eldest sons. Pattern tied in, he said, with psychologists\u2019 beliefs that only and eldest children tended to achieve more in life because they were disciplined more and trained and treated better by parents. Astronauts also were athletic, showed academic excellence, and had intense love of flying, O\u2019Toole said. (W Post, 3/2/69) Primary objectives were to demonstrate crew, space vehicle, and mission support facilities performance during manned Saturn V mission with CSM and LM; demonstrate LM and crew performance, demonstrate performance of nominal and selected backup lunar orbit rendezvous (lor) mission activities; and assess CSm/lm consumables. Multispectral photography experiment was carried for first time to provide photos of earth resources using several different film-filter combinations. Launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft, carrying Astronauts James A. McDivitt (commander), David R. Scott (cm pilot), and Russell L. Schweickart (lm pilot), entered initial orbit with 119.5-mi (192.3-km) apogee and 117.6-rai (189,3-km) perigee. After post-insertion checkout csm, code-named \u201cGumdrop,\u201d separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S\u2014IVB) and lm, code-named \u201cSpider.\u201d Crew successfully transposed csm and docked with lm, and docked spacecraft was separated from 3rd stage with rcs burn. Two S\u2014IVB burns placed stage on earth-escape trajectory. Crew conducted first docked SPS burn. On second day crew tracked landmarks, conducted pitch and yaw roll maneuvers, and increased apogee by firing sps engine three times. On third day, McDivitt and Schweickart entered lm through docking tunnel, evaluated lm systems, transmitted first telecast, and conducted first manned firing of lm descent propulsion system (dps). They then returned to csm and conducted fifth sps burn to circularize orbit. McDivitt and Schweickart reentered lm on fourth day and transmitted second telecast. Schweickart, recovered from earlier nausea, spent 37 min outside spacecraft, walking between lm and csm hatches, maneuvering on handrails, and standing in \u201cgolden slipper\u201d foot restraints. He commented on sun\u2019s brightness, photographed spacecraft and earth, and described rain squalls over ksc before he and McDivitt returned to csm. Scott opened cm hatch and retrieved thermal samples from csm exterior. McDivitt and Schweickart reentered lm on fifth day to perform csm\u2014lm rendezvous. Scott separated csm from lm and fired csm reaction control system thrusters to place spacecraft about 3.4 mi (5.5 km) apart, lm dps was ignited twice to set up rendezvous, lm descent stage was jettisoned and LM ascent propulsion system (aps) was fired to set up conditions for circularization. Although problems were encountered with crewman optical alignment sight (coas) because of extremely bright reflections, radar and optical sightings backed up by earth tracking enabled spacecraft to dock successfully after being up to 114 mi (183.5 km) apart during 6%-hr separation. After McDivitt and Schweickart returned to csm, crew jettisoned lm ascent stage and maneuvered to safe distance while stage burned to propellant depletion and entered orbit with 4,309-mi (6,934.5-km) apogee and 142.2-mi (228.8-km) perigee. By end of fifth day 97% of Apollo 9 objectives had been successfully accomplished. On sixth through ninth days crew conducted sixth and seventh SPS burns to alter apogee, tracked NASA\u2019s Pegasus III meteoroid detection satellite (launched July 30, 1965), took multispectral photos of earth, tracked landmarks, exercised spacecraft systems, and prepared for reentry. Final sps burn for deorbit on 10th day was delayed one revolution because of unfavorable weather in planned landing area, cm\u2014sm separation, parachute deployment, and other reentry events were nominal; spacecraft reentered during 152nd revolution and splashed down in Atlantic 180 mi east of Bahamas at 12:53 pm est March 13, 241 hrs 53 secs after launch, within sight of recovery ship U.S.S. Guadalcanal. Crew was picked up by helicopter and flown to recovery ship within one hour after splashdown. Astronauts were welcomed by Guadalcanal crew and received congratulatory telegram message from President Nixon which said: \u201cThe epic flight of Apollo Nine will be recorded in history as ten days that thrilled the world. You have by your courage and your skill helped to shape the future of man in space. The three of you and the great team which enabled you to complete your successful mission have shown the world that the spirit of man and his technological genius are eager to begin an age of adventure, an age which will benefit all the people on this good earth.\u201d All primary Apollo 9 objectives were achieved and anomalies were not serious enough to alter mission operations or flight plan significantly. First manned flight of lm qualified last major component for lunar landing mission. Apollo 9 was sixth Apollo mission to date and third manned Apollo mission. Earlier unmanned Apollo flights had yielded all spacecraft information possible without crew on board. Apollo 4 (launched Nov. 9, 1967) and Apollo 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1968) had both been highly successful, completing inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware. Apollo 6 (launched April 4, 1968), despite launch vehicle problems, had attained four of five primary objectives with spacecraft recovered in excellent condition. First manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7 (Oct. 11\u201422, 1968), had achieved all primary objectives and verified operation of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. Second manned mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21\u201427, 1968), proved capability of Apollo hardware and systems to operate out to lunar distances and return through earth\u2019s atmosphere.

At NASA\u2019s request, Univ. of Maryland physicist Carroll Alley had calculated effects on astronauts of phenomena described in Einstein\u2019s relativity equations\u2014 time ran slower for object as its speed increased, and time accelerated for object as it moved away from body exerting gravitational force. Alley found Apollo 8 spacecraft speed was predominant factor when it was within 4,000 mi of earth; time slowed and astronauts actually aged more slowly. Beyond 4,000 mi, effects of earth\u2019s gravity lessened as Apollo\u2019s time passed 300 microseconds faster than earth\u2019s. Despite Alley\u2019s calculations, said Time, Borman\u2019s claim was valid only for Astronaut William A. Anders, who made his first space flight on Apollo 8. Astronauts Borman and James A. Lovell had been crew-mates on Dec. 4-18, 1965, Gemini VII, when time dilation effect was dominant for entire two weeks. They had aged less than those on earth by 400 microseconds.

If true, the moon may be a book containing the secret of the earth\u2019s first billion years of life. This record is lost on the earth which is subjected to . . . erosion by atmosphere and water. ... By comparing similarities and contrasting differences, man may be able to arrive at a greater understanding of the fundamental processes that affect the earth; for example, the mechanisms that cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and the processes responsible for concentrating ore deposits. The orbits of Apollo 8 and the Lunar Orbiters were disturbed by mass concentrations beneath the circular lunar seas. These may be huge meteors that struck the moon with such force that they melted and sank into the interior, or they may be iron deposits. \u201cAnother objective of lunar exploration is to learn about man as a space explorer\u2014his capabilities and limitations. Some day man will move on to other planets; the moon is a training ground. . . . We don\u2019t have the basic information which early lunar landings will furnish and we can only speculate today about the feasibility of the moon as a base for an observatory or a permanent science station\u2014about exploiting its environment of low gravity and high vacuum\u2014about its potential for natural resources. ...

Issue was Intelsat\u2019s formal structure and problem was \u201cdetermining how large a role the United States should play.\u201d U.S. domination stemmed from its economic and technological power. U.S. firm, ComSatCorp, was made manager of Intelsat under 1964 agreement, to oversee satellite design, contract with NASA for launchings, and supervise operation in space. Month-long meeting had not resulted in accord on even draft agreement.

U.S. approach was, Why \u201ctamper with a successful formula?\u201d Fundamental issue lay deeper. \u201cTechnological superiority . . . creates its own foreign policy problems.

The considerable difference between conditions on the surface of the moon, Venus and Mars and those in which terrestrial life exists makes it necessary for us to extend our knowledge of the limits within which terrestrial life and life in general can exist. In this connexion Soviet scientists are investigating the possible limits of the existence of life. The absence of systematic processes for the movement of matter on the moon obviously makes active life on its surface impossible. On Mars, where free liquid water is probably absent, life is possible using matter transfer by frost, ice in the soil, water vapour and the wind. Examination of the temperature limits for the existence of life gives rise to a number of considerations which allow us not to exclude the possibility of the existence of life, in for example, the polar regions of Venus.\u201d (Text)",

Nimbus 111 carried usa\u2019s Egrs XIII (also called Secor XIII) Sequential Collation of Range satellite as secondary payload on Agena 2nd stage and injected it into orbit with 704-mi (1,132.7-km) apogee, 667-mi (1,073.2-km) perigee, 107.3-min period, and 99.9Â° inclination. Primary objectives were to inject Nimbus 111 into orbit and demonstrate satisfactory operation of active, three-axis, earth-oriented spacecraft for at least three months and to acquire representative global samples of infrared spectra for vertical temperature profiles of atmosphere. As secondary objectives spacecraft would make global maps of radiative energy balance of earth atmosphere and cloud cover over at least one seasonal cycle; demonstrate feasibility of surface pressure and tropospheric wind measurements by infrared interferometer spectrometer system and temperature profile determination by infrared spectrometry; make global maps of earth and day-and-night cloud cover for three months from image-dissector camera system and high-resolution infrared radiometer; and demonstrate SNAP\u201419 system as auxiliary power system for three months. Spacecraft carried seven meteorological experiments\u2014most ever carried on U.S. meteorological satellite\u2014and was first capable of measuring emitted infrared energy that would permit inference of atmospheric profile on global basis. Interrogation, recording, and location system (1RLS) would pinpoint position of special electronic platforms on fixed land sites and moving objects such as buoys, balloons, aircraft, and elk in Yellowstone National Park. Butterfly-shaped 1,269-lb Nimbus III was fourth in series of seven spacecraft designed to develop significantly improved meteorological satellite, prove applicability of instrumentation, and fulfill special data requirements of atmospheric sciences research community. It was replacement for Nimbus B, which failed to enter orbit May 18, 1968, when launch vehicle malfunctioned. Nimbus I (launched Aug. 28, 1964) had operated for one month before solar-array drive system malfunctioned. Nimbus II (launched May 15, 1966) had exceeded six-month lifetime, operating successfully until Jan. 18, 1969. Nimbus program was managed by gsfc under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 69\u201450)",

Apollo Applications program would be cut by $57 million but new obligational authority of $46 million for resumption of Saturn V rocket production and $40 million for lunar exploration would be added, for net increase of $29 million in manned space flight funds. Space science and applications would be cut by $41 million, to $517.8-million new total.

University affairs funding would remain at $9 million, technology utilization at $5 million, and NERVA funding under nuclear rocket program at $36.5 million. Funds proposed for construction of facilities and for research and program management remained unchanged. At NASA budget briefing, NASA Administrator Dr. Thomas O. Paine said: \u201cThe reductions we have been required to make will make necessary difficult program adjustments and will result in reduced accomplishments in many areas.

At press interview during annual meeting, he said pulsars\u2019 insides were probably superfluids\u2014 more liquid than liquid\u2014and were gradually cooling, with crust crystallization requiring adjustments. Adjustments, he said, would cause \u201cpulsequakes\u201d and could result in sudden speedups in pulsar periodicity. Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Thomas Gold said observations of pulsars indicated they slowed down as they aged, with oldest finally slowing billionths of seconds per year until they reached periods up to almost four seconds. He suggested pulsar radiation might account for luminosity of whole galaxies and even produce all cosmic rays detected throughout universe, including earth. Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Frank D.

(Amer Av, 5/12/69, 40-1) nas\u2014nrc submitted United States Space Science Program, comprehensive summary of scientific research in space science in U.S. during 1968. \u201cAlthough the principal concern of the space science program in the United States continues to be with the Earth, its environment, the Sun, interactions of solar and terrestrial phenomena, the Moon and planets, and the biological effects of weightlessness and radiation, there is a trend toward increasing emphasis on the use of space vehicles for stellar and galactic astronomy, especially in areas of the electromagnetic spectrum for which the atmosphere is essentially opaque. The successful operation of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory satellite and the rapid development of improved instruments and techniques for ultraviolet and x-ray astronomy . . . are examples of this trend.\u201d In interview with press, nas-nrc Space Science Board member Dr. Richard W. Porter said U.S. would probably have to review its expensive prophylactic measures in planned Mars landings if U.S.S.R. landed there first with same techniques and precautions used in Venus shots. Outgoing contamination of planets might well be bigger problem than contamination of incoming spacecraft. There was little likelihood of spacecraft landing on Mars and Venus and returning for at least 10 yrs, Dr. Porter said, and risk from lunar bacteriological contamination was infinitesimal. But contamination of planets was serious problem because it could spoil man\u2019s first chances to make a pure investigation of biological evolution elsewhere in the solar system.

Since pilots who regularly performed drastic maneuvers in aircraft seldom suffered motion sickness, astronauts had flown aerobatic jet flights in barrel rolls and high-gravity maneuvers during week before launch. (Cohn, W Post, 5/18/69, A8) Launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft\u2014carrying Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford (commander), John W. Young (cm pilot), and Eugene A. Cernan (lm pilot)\u2014entered initial parking orbit with 118.1-mi (189.9-km) apogee and 114.6-mi (184.4-km) perigee. Checkout followed lunar trajectory insertion; then csm, code-named Charlie Brown, separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S\u2014IVB) and lm, codenamed Snoopy. Crew successfully transposed csm and docked with lm. Excellent quality color TV coverage of docking sequences was transmitted to Goldstone tracking station and seen on worldwide commercial TV. Crew extracted lm from S\u2014IVB and conducted 1st sps burn. All launch vehicle safing activities were performed as scheduled and successful propellant dump provided impulse to S\u2014IVB for slingshot maneuver to earth-escape velocity. On second day, first midcourse maneuver was not required. Crew conducted midcourse maneuver number two, which was so accurate that third and fourth maneuvers were canceled. Five color TV transmissions totaling 72 min and showing excellent views of receding earth and spacecraft were made during translunar coast. Spacecraft entered moon\u2019s sphere of influence on fourth day, May 21, at 61:50 get. Crew conducted first lunar orbit insertion maneuver with 356-sec sps burn to reduce speed to 5,474 fps and place spacecraft in initial lunar orbit with 196.1-mi (315.5-km) apolune and 68.6-mi (110.4-km) perilune. Second loi maneuver, 13.9-sec sps burn, circularized orbit with 70.8-mi (113.9-km) apolune and 67.8-mi (109.1-km) perilune. Crew tracked lunar landmarks and transmitted 29-min color TV of lunar surface. Cernan transferred to lm at 81:55 get for two hours of housekeeping activities and communications test. On fifth day Stafford and Cernan entered lm and checked out all systems before firing sm reaction control system thrusters to separate csm and lm ahout 30 ft and again for 2.3-mi separation, lm descent propulsion system burn propelled lm to within 9.6 mi of lunar surface over landing site No. 2. Crew had no difficulty identifying landmarks and Stafford said, \u201cIt looks like all you have to do is put your tail wheel down and we\u2019re there. . . . The craters [around No. 2 landing site] look flat and smooth at the bottom. It should be real easy\u201d for Apollo 11 landing, lm crew took numerous photos of lunar surface and provided continuous commentary on their observations after cameras malfunctioned. Astronauts described volcanoes and light-colored craters that glowed as if lit by radioactive substance. Crew conducted lm radar test during low-altitude pass which indicated 47,000-ft pericynthian (lowest point in orbit), dps phasing burn raised apocynthian (orbital high point) to 218.6 mi (351.7 km). lm descent stage was jettisoned and Res separation maneuver and staging were accomplished. Anomaly in automatic abort guidance system caused lm ascent stage to undergo extreme gyrations. By taking over manual control, Stafford reestablished proper attitude. APS insertion maneuver burn at pericynthian established equivalent of standard LM insertion orbit of lunar landing mission (51.8 by 12.9 mi), where lm coasted for one hour. Concentric sequence initiation at apocynthian, constant-delta-height maneuver, and terminal maneuver were conducted. lm successfully docked with csm at 106:33 get, after eight-hour separation; and lm crew returned to csm. On sixth day lm ascent stage was jettisoned; its batteries burned to depletion and it entered solar orbit. Crew made 18 landmark sightings and took extensive stereo and oblique photos of moon. Two scheduled TV periods were deleted because of crew fatigue and crew rested and prepared for return to earth, sps burn at 137:36 get injected csm into transearth trajectory after 61.5 hrs (31 orbits) in lunar orbit. Maneuver was so accurate that two other scheduled midcourse maneuvers were not necessary. During return to earth astronauts made star-lunar landmark sightings, live color TV transmissions, star-earth horizon navigation sightings, and csm S-band high-gain antenna reflectivity test. Pictures of moon from receding spacecraft were spectacular. Scheduled 10- and 29-min color TV broadcasts of earth, moon, and spacecraft interior were later followed by unscheduled TV transmission, which provided beautiful pictures of earth and brought total color TV broadcasts to 19 transmissions totaling almost six hours. On eighth day crew prepared for reentry and SM separated from CM on schedule. Parachute deployment and other reentry events occurred as planned. Apollo 10 splashed down in Pacific at 12:52 pm edt May 26, 3.4 mi from recovery ship U.S.S. Princeton 192 hrs 3 min after launch and precisely on time. Crew was picked up and reached recovery ship at 1:31 pm edt. All primary Apollo 10 mission objectives and detailed test objectives were achieved. All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed according to plan, with only minor discrepancies, which were corrected. Flight crew performance was outstanding; all three crew members remained in excellent health and their prevailing good spirits were continually evident. Accomplishments included evaluation of LM steerable antenna at lunar distances; demonstration of lunar landing mission profile; low-level evaluation of lunar visibility; inflight demonstration of Weslinghouse color TV camera; testing of landing radar in near-lunar environment; and manned navigational, visual, and photographic evaluation of lunar landing sites 2 and 3, and in addition other possible lauding sites in highland areas. Apollo 10 was seventh Apollo mission to date, fourth manned Apollo mission, largest payload ever placed in earth and lunar orbits, and first demonstration of lunar orbit rendezvous. Mission acquired major quantities of photographic training materials for Apollo 11 and subsequent missions and numerous visual observations and photos of scientific significance. First manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7 (Oct. 11\u201422, 1968), had achieved all primary objectives and had verified operation of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. First manned lunar orbital mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21\u201427, 1968), had proved capability of Apollo spacecraft and hardware to operate out to lunar distances and return through earth\u2019s atmosphere at lunar velocity.

He reiterated opinion he stated in Dec. 1968 Earth Resources Satellite System report: \u201cPrecise determination of cost effectiveness at this early stage ... is not possible. . . . The magnitude of the economic benefits simply cannot be calculated in the absence of the type of data which the system is designed to produce.\u201d Conclusions of studies already completed had constituted \u201cstrong evidence that precision was not possible. Yet, I am reassured by the fact that all such studies . . . have concluded that the potential economic benefits will exceed the costs of such a system by a substantial margin and some predict that benefits will someday .be measured in billions of dollars annually. It is my personal conviction that an operational ers system will ultimately prove highly cost-effective.\u201d Karth said he considered it \u201cnasa\u2019s responsibility to experiment with new space systems that appear to have potential, and to conduct the necessary research and development which will lead to a firm foundation for a subsequent determination as to whether operational systems should be built. In this context, I believe cost effectiveness is not an appropriate standard to apply in advance to NASA\u2019s experimental work, though it is certainly applicable when the time comes to decide whether to go forward with an operational system.\u201d (Science, 5/30/69, 1009)",

Skeptics do not build societies; the idealists are the builders. Only societies that believe in themselves can rise to their challenges. Let us not, then, pose a false choice between meeting our responsibilities abroad and meeting the needs of our people at home. We shall meet both or we shall meet neither. \u201cThis is why my disagreement with the skeptics and the isolationists is fundamental. They have lost the vision indispensable to great leadership. They observe the problems that confront us; they measure our resources and then they despair. When the first vessels set out from Europe for the New World these men would have weighed the risks and they would have stayed behind. . . . \u201cOur current exploration of space makes the point vividly, here is testimony to man\u2019s vision and man\u2019s courage. The journey of the astronauts is more than a technical achievement: it is a reaching-out of the human spirit. It lifts our sights; it demonstrates that magnificent conceptions can be real. \u201cThey inspire us and at the same time they teach us true humility. What could bring home to us more the limitation of the human scale than the hauntingly beautiful picture of our earth seen from the moon? \u201cWhen the first man stands on the moon next month every American will stand taller because of what he has done, and we should be proud of this magnificent achievement. \u201cWe will know then that every man achieves his own greatness by reaching out beyond himself, and so it is with nations. When a nation believes in itself\u2014as Athenians did in their Golden Age, as Italians did in the Renaissance\u2014that nation can perform miracles. Only when a nation means something to itself can it mean something to others. \u201cThat is why I believe a resurgence of American idealism can bring about a modern miracle\u2014and that modern miracle is a world order of peace and justice.\u201d (PD, 6/9/69, 797\u2014802)",

Scientists would also record heart action and respiration, monitor circulatory and urinary systems, and observe performance on two behavioral tasks\u2014short-term memory and eye-hand coordination. Some 80% of the experimental data would be radioed to earth by high-speed telemetry at rate of 22,400 bps 18\u201426 times per day. Spacecraft would be retrieved in midair or, off ocean surface after, reentry. Monkey would be flown to Hawaii laboratories, where scientists would examine him for changes in bone density, muscle tone, blood cell mass, fluid balance, and reproductive system. [See July 7\u20148.] Biosatellite III was third and last spacecraft in Biosatellite series. Biosatellite I (launched Dec. 14, 1966) had failed to deorbit on command after three days in orbit because of retrorocket system failure and had not been recovered. Biosatellite II, successfully launched Sept. 7, 1967, and recovered Sept. 9, 1967, had demonstrated that plants required gravity to maintain orientation and showed effect of radiation on living organisms. Biosatellite project was managed by arc under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 69\u201479)",

Astronauts were seated 50 ft from nearest newsmen and were partially enclosed in plastic booth as part of plan to limit crew\u2019s contacts during 21 days immediately preceding flight and prevent development of illness. Collins told press that from CM viewpoint, Apollo 11 should not be very different from previous manned Apollo missions. He did not feel \u201cslightest bit frustrated\u201d about going to moon without landing on it: \u201cI\u2019m going 99.9 . . . percent of the way there, and that suits me fine.\u201d lm flight plan would pick up where Apollo 10 left off with phasing maneuver, Aldrin explained. There would be number of \u201cfirsts\u201d: \u201cthe ultimate test,\u201d actual touchdown; 1/6 g environment; new thermal conditions; two-man EVA on lunar surface; sleeping in LM on moon; star sighting technique with alignment telescope on lunar surface; and powered ascent from moon with seven-minute engine burn. One of important early activities after exiting from lm on moon would be determining best pace for moving about: \u201c. . . there have been several different techniques employed in the partial zero gravity training. And, it looks like you can walk conventionally one foot after another. It also looks as though you can do a two-footed hop\u2014kangaroo style.\u201d In training in aircraft flown at 1/6 g, \u201ca fairly rapid pace\u201d appeared quite easy to perform. \u201cIt looks like we shouldn\u2019t have too much difficulty in moving at something like 6, 8, or 10 miles per hour.\u201d Armstrong said crew would use \u201csomewhat hybrid methods of manual and automatic\u201d for descent to moon. \u201cThe predicted method at this point, although we have a great deal of flexibility and choice, based on the situation at the time, would he to maintain manual control of attitude and automatic control of throttle through the final descent from an altitude of somewhere between 500 and 1000 feet until such time as the automatic throttle rated descent was unsatisfactory, at which time we\u2019ll go full manual on the throttle ... flying it in a manner like a normal vtol machine.\u201d Code names for cm and lm had been selected as \u201crepresentative of the flight, the nation\u2019s hope,\u201d Armstrong revealed, lm would be called \u201cEagle\u201d for U.S. national emblem, and cm would be called \u201cColumbia\u201d for U.S. symbol, statue on top of Capitol, and Jules Verne\u2019s fictional spacecraft, \u201cColumbiad,\u201d which flew to moon 100 yrs ago.

Johnson, and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew at Kennedy Space Center. In ksc Launch Control Center (above) mission officials relaxed after launch; left to right were Charles W. Matthews, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight; Dr. Wernher von Braun, Director of msfc; Dr, George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight; and l/g Samuel C, Phillips, Apollo Program Director. was heading was in center of large, rugged crater with 5- to 10-ft-dia boulders. Consequently crew flew past crater to more suitable touchdown point by controlling attitude manually and adjusting descent rate and horizontal velocity. Officials later attributed change in course to malfunction in onboard radar and subsequent critical overload of computer, which caused warning alarms and could have aborted mission. lm landed on moon at 102:46 get (4:18 pm edt July 20) in Sea of Tranquility, 20,800 ft west and 4,000\u20145,000 ft south of center of planned landing ellipse. Landing-point coordinates were approximately 23,5Â°E and 0.64Â°N and site altitude was approximately 8,600 ft below moon\u2019s mean radius. Armstrong reported: \u201cHouston, Tranquility Base here\u2014the Eagle has landed.\u201d Mission Control replied: \u201cRoger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We are breathing again. Thanks a lot.\u201d Armstrong said landing area contained numerous boulders up to two feet in diameter, some apparently fractured by LM engine exhaust, and surface color varied from very light to dark gray. Crew immediately adapted to one-sixth (earth) gravity in lm and moved with ease. About two hours after landing astronauts requested and were granted permission to perform extravehicular activities (eva) on moon\u2019s surface before sleep period\u2014about 4Vs hrs earlier than originally scheduled. After postlanding checks, Armstrong opened LM hatch, descended lm ladder, and deployed modularized equipment stowage assembly (mesa) containing camera, which recorded his descent to lunar surface. Aldrin remained inside LM and recorded Armstrong\u2019s descent with 16-mm Maurer camera. Armstrong took man\u2019s first step on moon at 109:24 get (10:56 pm EDT July 20). Some 600 million viewers on earth\u2014one-fifth of world population\u2014watched live TV transmission and heard him describe feat as \u201cone small step for a man\u2014one giant leap for mankind.\u201d Collins, orbiting moon alone in CSM Columbia, was unable to see landing and subsequent eva because csm was not equipped to receive TV transmission. Armstrong said moon had \u201cstark beauty all its own\"\u2019 like desert in southwestern U.S. Lunar surface was \u201cfine and powdery\u201d and could be kicked up loosely- \u201cIt adheres like powdered charcoal . . . but I only go jn a small fraction of an inch. I can see my footprint in the moon like fine grainy particles.\u201d Armstrong checked EM exterior and reported penetration of EM footpads into lunar surface was three to four inches and that strut collapse was minimal. Blast of descent engine had not formed crater in surface and about one foot of clearance remained between engine bell and lunar surface. He reported only problem was seeing his footing in darkness of lm shadow. He emplaced microdot containing messages from world leaders, collected contingency sample of lunar soil near lm ladder, and reported that, although surface consisted of soft loose material, material six or eight inches under surface was very hard and cohesive. Rocks were very slippery, apparently because vesicles (pores) were filled with powdery surface material. Armstrong photographed Aldrin\u2019s descent to lunar surface at 11:15 pm edt and astronauts unveiled plaque mounted on strut behind ladder and read its inscription to tneir worldwide TV audience; \u201cHere men from the planet earth first set foot on the moon July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.*\u2019 Armstrong then removed TV camera from MESA, obtained panorama, and placed camera on tripod 40 ft from LM to view subsequent EVA, Aldrin experimented to assess mobility on moon by walking, running, leaping, and doing twofooted kangaroo hops between LM and camera. He indicated some difficulty in maintaining balance but said that his agility was better than expected and that he was able to move with great ease. Mass of backpack affected inertia and caused \u201cslight tendency ... to tip backwards, If I\u2019m about to lose my balance in one direction, recovery is quite natural and easy. You\u2019ve just got to be careful landing in die direction you want to go in.\u201d Aldrin deployed solar wind composition experiment in sunlight north of LM and joined Armstrong in erecting three, by five-foot American flag on eight-foot aluminum staff. Astronauts saluted flag and then talked by radiotelephone with President Nixon at White House in what President called \u201cmost historic telephone call ever made from the White House,\u201d President said: \u201cBecause of what you have done the heavens have become a part of man\u2019s world. As you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to earth.

Continuing eva, Armstrong collected bulk sample of assorted surface materia] and selected rock chunks, inspected lm, deployed passive seismic experiment package and laser ranging retroreflector, and collected two core samples and 20 lbs of discretely selected material. Throughout EVA continuous black-and-white coverage of crew activity provided live documentation, with telemetered data and voice comments. Lunar surface photography included both still and sequence coverage using Hasselbtad, Maurer data-acquisition, and Apollo lunar surface close-up cameras. Astronauts completed eva, transferred film and samples to LM, reentered LM and jettisoned equipment according to plan, closing hatch by Hl:39 get (1:11 am edt July 21). Armstrong and Aldrin rested inside LM seven hours and checked out systems. At 124:22 get (1:54 pm July 21) lm successfully lifted off moon, after 21 hrs 36 min on lunar surface.

Crew transferred with samples and film to csm, and LM ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit. SM reaction-control-system separation maneuver placed CSM into orbit with 72,0 mi (115.9-km) apolune and 63.0-mi (101.4-km) perilune, where crew rested and prepared for return to earth. cm separated from SM on schedule at 194:49 GET. Because of deteriorating weather in nominal landing area, splashdown point was moved 247.4 mi downrange, where weather was excellent. Parachute deployment and other reentry events occurred as planned. Apollo 11 splashed down in mid-Pacific at 12:51 pm edt July 24, 15 mi from recovery ship U.S.S. Hornet, 195 hrs 19 min after launch. Swimmers attached flotation collar and seven-man raft to spacecraft and helicopter dropped biological isolation garments, which were donned by astronauts inside CM and by one swimmer. Two other swimmers moved upwind of CM on another large raft. Postlanding ventilation was turned off and CM powered down, and astronauts climbed out and helped swimmer close hatch. Swimmer then decontaminated all garments, hatch area, flotation collar, and area around postlanding vent valves with Betadine disinfectant. Helicopter carried astronauts to recovery ship, where they entered 32-ft-long mobile quarantine facility (mqf) with recovery physician and technician. They were congratulated by President Nixon and Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, who were on board ship. Crew, physician, and technician remained inside mqf until it was delivered to Lunar Receiving Laboratory (lRl) in Houston July 27. cm was retrieved, placed in dolly on board recovery ship, moved to MQF, and mated to transfer tunnel. From inside MQF/cm containment envelope, mqf engineer removed lunar samples and equipment through decontamination lock and CM was sealed until delivery to lrl. Sample return containers, film, and other data were flown to Johnston Island and to Houston for transport to LRL. Primary Apollo 11 mission objective\u2014to perform manned landing on moon and return\u2014and all detailed test objectives were achieved. All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed according to plan, with only minor, corrected discrepancies. Flight crew performance was outstanding; all three crew members remained in excellent health and their prevailing good spirits and proficiency were major factors in mission\u2019s success. Accomplishments included first manned lunar landing and return; first lunar surface EVA; first seismometer, laser reflector, and solar wind experiment deployed on moon; first lunar soil samples returned to earth; largest U.S. payload ever placed into lunar orbit (72,037.6 lbs at lunar orbit insertion); acquisition of numerous visual observations, photos and TV transmissions of scientific and engineering significance; and first operational use of mqf and lrl. Apollo 11 was eighth Apollo mission to date, fifth manned Apollo mission, and first manned lunar landing mission. Mission acquired major quantities of data for subsequent Apollo flights. First manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7 (Oct. 11\u201422, 1968), had verified operation of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. First manned lunar orbital mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21\u201427, 1968), had proved capability of Apollo spacecraft and hardware to operate out to lunar distance and return through earth\u2019s atmosphere. Apollo 9 (March 3\u201413, 1969) had proved capability of lm to operate in space under manned conditions. Apollo 10 (May 18\u201426, 1969) had successfully operated complete Apollo spacecraft on lunar orbital mission and had provided major quantities of scientific and training materials for Apollo 11.

New York Times: \u201cOne could hardly watch the magnificent spectacle of the liftoff, let alone contemplate the feats of human ingenuity that made it possible, as well as the courage and skill of the flyers, without some reflection upon the meaning of this event. . . . The temptation is strong to fall back upon lyricism. The poetry of the thing has yet to find its expression in any of the earnest, proficient Americans who have ventured away from the Earth; yet, the stunning beauty of man\u2019s most marvelous creation, as it rose in its majesty toward the unknown, toward the future, could be matched only by the profound sense of having been present at an end to something and therefore necessarily at a beginning.\u201d (Wicker, NYT, 7/17/69) Chicago Tribune: \u201cThe Apollo 11 blastoff was as beautiful a one as we\u2019ve seen. It displayed every hit of the precision and the careful planning which we have come to expect from NASA.\u201d One of most \u201csatisfying\u201d things was that, \u201clike our earlier launchings, it took place within the sight of anybody who wanted to go to the Florida coast to watch it, and was broadcast live to countless millions more in every corner of the world. People will not fail to contrast this with the secrecy of Russia\u2019s unmanned Luna 15, which may reach the moon today on a mysterious mission of its own.\u201d (C Trib, 7/17/69) Christian Science Monitor: \u201cAnd although it is an American moon-craft, bearing American men . . . the venture is, in the best sense, a universal one. It is the result of American technology putting to use the knowledge, techniques and discoveries in which all nations and races have participated. ... all nations and peoples are taking part.\u201d (CSM, 1/17/69) Seattle Times: \u201cThe space program has yielded immense new resources in . . . scientific and technological advances which . . . make the program worth while even beyond the explorations and discoveries \u2014and national pride\u2014offered by the ventures into outer space. It strikes us, therefore, that the time is at hand for these so-called byproducts of the space program, which hold such promise for utilization in behalf of mankind, to be put to work for that purpose.\u201d (S Times, 7/17/69) Bulgarian Telegraph Agency report carried in Bulgarian newspapers Rabotnichesko Delo, Narodna Mladezh, Trud, and Kooperativno Celo commented: \u201cIn the coming days all humanity will follow this flight with interest and tension.

Latham and Dr. M. Ewing of Columbia Univ.\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Dr. F. Press of mit, and Dr. G. Sutton of Univ. of Hawaii explained objective was to detect naturally occurring seismic events on lunar surface through early Apollo scientific experiment package (easep) planted on moon. Package weighed 105 lbs and would transmit data to earth one year (or maximum two years), during lunar days because its solar cell panels required illumination to provide power. Complete Apollo lunar surface experiments package (alsep), containing at least three additional experiments for measurements of solar wind and magnetic field, would be included on Apollo 12 for day and night operation. In Apollo 11 experiment astronaut would remove instrument from lm to smoothest area within 6.6\u20149.8 ft (20\u201430 m) of lm, unfold solar panels, adjust package level to within 5Â°, orient it with azimuth for maximum illumination of solar panels, and aim antenna toward earth. MSC would issue commands to uncage and level seismometers and select proper gain. Expected sources of lunar seismic activity included several hundred monthly moonquakes, thermal stresses produced by rapid temperature variations at surface; tidal stresses exerted by earth and sun; and meteoroid impacts. By end of Apollo program, scientists hoped to have achieved crude curves of travel time for body and surface waves and beginning of seismicity map of moon. During post-Apollo period, seismologists wanted to achieve wider distribution of detectors to map seismically active belts in greater detail; study mechanisms of energy release; lower minimum detectable ground motion of individual seismometer; and improve performance of long-period seismometer systems at ultralong-period end of spectrum for recording surface waves from moonquakes, free oscillations of moon, and lunar tides.

Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said: . . we now stand at what is undoubtedly the greatest decision point in the history of this planet.\u201d Apollo 11 had proved \u201cthat man is no longer bound to the limits of the planet on which for so long he has lived. We will return to the moon first in November and then at regular intervals in the coming year. But these trips are only the first step. . . . Will we press forward to explore other planets or will we deny the opportunity to the future? To me, the choice is clear. We must take the next step. . . . This is the time for decision. . . . The knowledge possessed by men is sufficient, the resources are adequate for the task of carrying out this next step. . . . \u201cIn this moment of man\u2019s greatest achievement, it is timely for us to dedicate ourselves to the unfinished work so nobly begotten by three of us. To resolve that this nation, under God, will join with all men in the pursuit of the destiny of mankind will lead to the way to the planets.\u201d In answer to questions, Dr. Mueller said next major step should be manned landing on Mars which would be possible \u201csometime after 1980.\u201d l/g Samuel C. Phillips (usaf), Apollo Program Director, told press Apollo team was \u201cstrongest team that\u2019s ever assembled in the history of man. It has the strength of technical and engineering confidence, scientific competence, and management competence that\u2019s unexcelled. It has the dedication that\u2019s necessary to be able to tackle an almost impossible job and bring it through\u201d and an exciting future in lunar exploration. Second manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 12, would be launched from ksc Nov. 14 toward touchdown on Site 7 in moon\u2019s Ocean of Storms. Primary objective would be to deploy Apollo lunar surface experiment package (alsep), explore and survey mare area, and return samples to earth. Secondary objective, if lm softlanded on target, would be to examine Surveyor III spacecraft (launched April 17, 1967), which was resting on moon near planned Apollo 12 touchdown point. Astronauts would have two periods for extravehicular activities (eva), during which they would explore surface and conduct experiments for over three hours and walk farther away from spacecraft than had Apollo 11 crew. Maximum lunar stay time would be 28\u201432 hrs. Schedule called for planning to fly follow-on missions through Apollo 15 at four-month intervals and missions after that at five-month intervals.

Pictures\u2014enhanced by computers at JPL to clear out static, highlight images, adjust contrast and brightness, and exaggerate features\u2014were spectacular. They showed that Mars was heavily cratered and looked very much like moon. One photo showed 11-mi-dia crater closely resembling moon\u2019s Copernicus crater and diagonal ditch resembling lunar rifle. During closest approach, onboard TV cameras took 12 high-resolution and 12 medium-resolution pictures, stored some on board for later playback, and transmitted some immediately to ground stations for conversion to images at JPL.

This is what the Earth might have looked like some four billion years ago before it developed an atmosphere and oceans to weather its surface and nurture life.\u201d Photos taken on pass Aug. 4 were transmitted to JPL Aug. 5. Polar cap, which had appeared gleaming white in more distant photos, looked dull gray in closeups. Pictures showed south polar cap with snow-like substance-\u2014possibly frozen carbon dioxide\u2014piled up in vast dunes; pocked with deep, steeply walled craters; and much darker than desert to north. Floor of bright circular Hellas desert area, believed to be shallow crater or collapsed area, was strangely free of meteorite impact craters. Mariner VII (launched March 27) with Mariner VI (launched Feb. 24) had provided most detailed information to date on Mars, including 198 photos covering 20% of planet and detailed scientific data from onboard experiments. Data indicated: thin Martian atmosphere had no detectable nitrogen; south polar cap, which appeared white and smoothly circular in telescope pictures, was ragged with dark splotch in center; surface temperatures ranged from 75Â°F to \u2014100Â°F; some of narrower thin dark lines called canals might be segments of rubbled rims of craters up to 300 mi across; and Martian surface, though heavily pocked, was not as rugged as lunar surface.

Introducing programs, Dr. Paine said: \u201cThe decade of the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s should have a program as bold in concept and as productive as we have had in the decade of the 1960\u2019s. ... we need to have clear objectives to focus our work and a commitment, subject ... to annual review, as to what these achievements will be. Our general goal area should be the continued exploration of the solar system while deriving the maximum scientific and practical benefits here on earth from the space program. There is no question that, at some future time, we will have the capability for manned planetary exploration and we need to face now some of the decisions that will not bear fruition for more than a decade. Although I do not believe that we will see manned exploration of the planets in the 1970\u2019s in the United States ... I do think this could come in the 1980\u2019s.

(NASA Release 69-131) Study of lunar samples was \u201cbringing to light as many mysteries as it unravels,\u201d New York Times editorial said. Theorists were cautious, with evidence from one small area, Tranquility Base. \u201cIt is likely that the picture will become still more complex when a representative collection of samples becomes available from ten, twenty or thirty areas spread over the entire lunar surface. But even the limitations of the present data suggest strongly that the moon is very different from earth, and therefore has much to teach human science about the origin and evolution of the solar system. The case for intensive scientific study of the moon\u2014conducted in part by geologists and other scientists sent there for on-the-spot investigation-\u2014is strong.\u201d (NYT, 9/10/69, 40) September 11: Press conference on results of Mariner VI (launched Feb. 24) and Mariner VII (launched March 27) was held at NASA Hq. Some 200 TV pictures of Mars were taken by two Mariners, including 57 high- and medium-resolution views of selected Martian surface areas from altitude of only few hundred miles. Spacecraft measured Martian atmospheric temperature, pressure, and chemical constituency and measured surface temperatures in effort to correlate thermal characteristics with features observed in TV pictures. Data indicated Mars was heavily cratered, bleak, cold, dry, nearly airless, and generally hostile to any earth-style life forms. Dr. Robert B. Leighton of Cal Tech said: \u201cWe got nine times the number of far encounter pictures that were originally proposed [few years ago], 20 per cent more near encounter pictures than were proposed, and 1,100 digital pictures which were entirely impossible according to schemes at the time of the proposal. . . . After Mariner 4 Mars seemed to be like the moon. At last Mariners 6 and 7 have shown Mars to be like Mars and have brought out Mars\u2019 own characteristic features, some of them unknown and unrecognized elsewhere in the solar system.\u201d Dr. Robert P. Sharp of Cal Tech said Martian terrain could be divided into three types\u2014crater, featureless, and. chaotic. Cratered terrain was widespread and common on Mars and resembled moon. Featureless terrain was represented by Hellas area, which appeared to be upland area, 150-mi-wide zone that gently sloped into flat featureless floor. Chaotic terrain had series of \u201cshort ridges, little valleys, and irregular, jumbled topography.\u201d Chaotic and featureless terrain appeared to be distinctly Martian, suggesting \u201cthat on Mars we have either a difference in processes that are operating on the surface or within the crust or we have a difference of material from one place to another on Mars and different than on the moon, or, more likely, a combination of both. ... We also have good reason for believing that the evolutionary history has been somewhat different. Again, there are scars on the face of Mars that we do not see on the face of the moon. And there have perhaps been episodic events in Martian history that are unique to the planet Mars. We end up with the conclusion that Mars is its own planet.\u201d Dr. George C. Pimentel of Univ. of California at Berkeley said reevaluation of initial data from infrared spectrometer had shown infrared spectral features earlier ascribed to methane and ammonia were actually due to previously undiscovered absorptions of solid carbon dioxide. Reflection peak recorded three times in atmosphere off Mars\u2019 bright limb showed presence of solid carbon dioxide at high altitudes and at latitudes north of polar cap. Broad absorption near 9 p. recorded on bright limb was ascribed to solid silica or silicate material and broad absorptions near 12 p. recorded near dark limb were tentatively ascribed in part to solid carbon dioxide above ground. Further experimental work was in progress to refine thermal map. Initial results of uv spectrometer experiment were detection of ionized carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, atomic hydrogen, and oxygen. Nitrogen and nitric oxide were not detected and no evidence was found of clouds, blue haze, or any appreciable atmospheric absorption of uv radiation. Dr. Charles A. Barth of Univ. of Colorado said important point \u201cis that the atmosphere of Mars is different than the atmosphere of the earth. If I showed you a spectrum taken the same way from the upper atmosphere of the earth, we would see a plentiful number of nitrogen bands. We could see emissions from nitric oxide. We could see emissions from atomic nitrogen. None of those features is present in the atmosphere of Mars. . . .\u201d Dr. Norman H. Horowitz of jpl presented biological implications of Mariner 1969 results. \u201cThere is nothing in the new data that encourages the belief that Mars is a body of life. But the results don\u2019t exclude this possibility. . . . The Mariner 6 and 7 data strengthen the previous conclusion that the scarcity of water on Mars is the most serious limiting factor for life. . . . Mars is a cold desert by terrestrial standards. If there is life on Mars, it must be a form of life that can utilize water in the form of water vapor or ice.\u201d (Transcript; NASA News Release)",

      "story": " Space Task Group presented report The Post-Apollo Space Program: Directions for the Future to President Nixon at White House. It recommended basic goal of balanced manned and unmanned space program conducted for all mankind, with emphasis on increased utilization of space capabilities for services to man through expanded space applications program; enhancement of U.S. defense posture for world peace and security through exploitation of space techniques for military missions; continuing strong program of lunar and planetary exploration, astronomy, physics, and earth and life sciences; development of new systems and technology for space operations, emphasizing commonality, reusability, and economy through development of new space transportation capability and space station modules; and promotion of world community through program of broad international participation and cooperation. As focus for development of new capability, Task Group recommended U.S. accept long-range goal of manned planetary exploration with manned Mars mission before end of century. Activities leading to goal should include initial concentration on exploiting existing capability and developing new one while maintaining program balance within available resources; operational phase using new systems and capabilities in earth-moon space, with men living and working in that environment for extended periods; and manned exploration missions out of earth-moon space, using experience of earlier two phases. Schedule and budgetary implications of phases were subject to Presidential choice, with detailed program to be determined in normal annual budget and program review. Report outlined three possible NASA programs for manned Mars landing before century\u2019s end. Option I would launch manned mission in mid-1980s and would establish orbiting lunar station, 50-man earthorbiting space base, and lunar surface base. Funding would rise from current $4-billion level to $8- to $10-billion level in 1980. Decision to proceed with development of space station, earth-to-orbit shuttle, and space tug would be required in FY 1971. Option II would include Mars mission launch in 1986, allowing for evaluation of unmanned Mars mission results before final designation of landing date and require about $8-billion maximum annual expenditure in early 1980s. Option III would include initial development of space station and reusable shuttles, as in Options I and II, but would defer decision on manned Mars landing date while maintaining goal of after 1980 but before close of century. Concurrent development of space transportation system and modular space stations would require rise in 1976 annual expenditures to $5.7 billion, while their development in series would entail $4- to $5-billion funding level. Recommended DOD options were: (A) program of full military space capability in case of overt threat to national security, (B) development of efforts to counter known and accepted projections of security threat and increase in development activities if threat increased, and (C) program of lower level system deployment with technology and support effort necessary for contingency planning on assumption that lessening of world tensions would reduce emphasis on national defense. At White House briefing following presentation, press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said President Nixon had concurred in Task Group\u2019s rejection of two other, extreme space programs, one to land men on Mars as soon as possible, regardless of cost, and one to eliminate manned flight program after completion of Apollo. He did not know when President would make decision on course to follow, but budgetary considerations would be major factor. (Text; PD, 9/22/69, 1291; NYT, 9/16/69, 1)",

During conference NASA released PET Summary of Apollo 11 Lunar Samples, report of 60-day preliminary examination of 48 lbs of Apollo 11 lunar samples in lrl by university and Government scientists on NASA Preliminary Examination Team (pet). Report confirmed existence of unexplained erosion process on lunar surface indicated in Ranger, Lunar Orbiter, and Surveyor photos, \u201cunlike any process so far observed on earth\u201d; said unique chemical composition (that of silicate liquid) of Tranquility Base fines and igneous rocks \u201cimplies either the composition of the rock from which the liquid was derived differs significantly from that of the mantle of the earth, or that the mechanism by which the liquid was formed differs from analogous terrestrial processes\u201d; and concluded there was \u201cvery good chance that the time of crystallization of some of the Apollo 11 rocks may date back to times earlier than the oldest rocks on earth.\u201d Samples could be divided into fine- and medium-grained crystalline of igneous origin, breccias of complex origin, and fines. Crystalline rocks differed from any terrestrial rock and from meteorites in modal mineralogy and bulk chemistry. Erosion had occurred on lunar surface but there was no evidence it was caused by surface water. Probable presence of assemblage iron-troilite-ilmenite and absence of any hydrated phase indicated crystalline rocks were formed under extremely low partial pressures of oxygen, water, and sulfur. Absence of hydrated minerals suggested absence of any surface water at Tranquility Base since rocks were exposed. Rocks and fines showed evidence of shock or impact metamorphism; all rocks displayed glass-lined surface pits possibly caused by impact of small particles; and fine material and breccia contained gases that indicated they were derived from solar wind. Measurements on igneous rock indicated crystallization 3 billion to 4 billion yrs ago. Rocks had been within one meter of surface for 20 million to 160 million yrs. Level of indigenous volatiliz-able and/or pyrolyzable organic material was extremely low. All rocks and fines were generally similar chemically. Major and minor constituents were same as in terrestrial igneous rocks and meteorites, but differences in composition were significant. Elements that were enriched in iron meteorites were not observed or were very low in occurrence. No evidence of biological material had been found. Tranquility Base soil was fine grained, granular, cohesive, and incompressible, with hardness increasing at six-inch depth. It was similar in appearance and behavior to soil at Surveyor landing sites. (Program; Text; Science, 9/19/69)",

I stood in the highlands of this Nation, near the Continental Divide, introducing to my sons the wonders of nature and pleasures of looking for deer and for elk. In their enthusiasm for the view they frequently stumbled on the rocky trails, but when they looked only to their footing, they did not see the elk. To those of you who have advocated looking high we owe our sincere gratitude, for you have granted us the opportunity to see some of the grandest views of the Creator. To those of you who have been our honest critics, we also thank, for you have reminded us that we dare not forget to watch the trail.\u201d Astronaut Aldrin said: \u201cOur steps in space have been a symbol of this country\u2019s way of life as we open our doors and windows to the world to view our Successes and failures and as we share with all nations our discovery. The Saturn, Columbia, and Eagle, and the extravehicular mobility unit have proved . . . that this Nation can produce equipment of the highest quality and dependability. This should give all of us hope and inspiration to overcome some of the more difficult problems here on earth. The Apollo lesson is that national goals can he met where there is a strong enough will to do so.\u201d Astronaut Collins said: \u201cWe have taken to the moon the wealth of this Nation, the vision of its political leaders, the intelligence of its scientists, the dedication of its engineers, the careful craftsmanship of its workers, and the enthusiastic support of its people.

(Teltsch, NYT, 10/5/69, 16) Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, gave Invited Lecture Oct. 6 on Apollo program, space benefits, Apollo Applications program, and lunar exploration. Apollo Applications program would \u201cstudy the earth through the use of a six lens multispectral camera installation. On Apollo 9 some of the rudimentary work was done using four lenses. 50% more kinds of information will be brought back by the crews of Apollo Applications. Because almost everything on earth has a different reflective quality, as distinctive as a signature or a fingerprint, results from this photographic exploration can be expected to yield rich rewards. Many of the earth sciences look to this kind of information for answers to previously unanswerable questions. Hydrologists are interested in discovering not only the depth, but also the temperature of the waters of the world, and these conditions can be ascertained from space. Warm water attracts certain species of fish, so fishermen are also interested in these experiments. \u201cAgronomists believe that soil chemistry will reveal itself on a large scale in certain kinds of filtered photography. Agriculturists know that different crops, at different stages of their development and in different states of health, reflect distinctive amounts of light. They hope, using the photographs we will take, to get some measure of the world\u2019s crop, as well as some knowledge of its condition. Geologists, who have found clues to mineral deposits in the Gemini and Apollo pictures, look to this more sophisticated photography for additional information, and for distinctions which will eventually permit certain kinds of prospecting from space. Cartographers and Geodesists are interested in everything from urban sprawl to continental drift.\u201d Sun would be prime target for exploration in Apollo Applications program, with experiments conducted by astronaut-astronomers using Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) in orbit. \u201cFor the first time we will have a massive set of instruments with high resolution for looking in some depth and detail at the activities of the sun from beyond the veil of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u201d Program would consist of three missions into near-earth space, one of 28 days and two of 56 days each.

Scientific objectives were to investigate major classes of lunar surface features, surface processes, and regional problems; collect samples at each site for analyses on earth; establish network of surface instrumentation to measure seismic activity, heat flow, and disturbance in moon\u2019s axis of rotation; survey and measure lunar surface from lunar orbit with high-resolution photography and remote sensing; investigate near-moon environment and interaction of moon with solar wind; map lunar gravitational field and internally produced magnetic field; and detect atmospheric components resulting from neutralized solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts. Achievement of scientific objectives would be facilitated by addition of scientific instrument module (sim) under service module sector door, sim would consist of scientific instruments mounted on shelves behind door, which would be deployed pyrotechnically after crew left lunar surface. Spacecraft would also use new modular equipment storage assembly (mesa) . \u201cUnlike the existing mesa it is modular and people, instead of having to take many things out of compartments and stick them into a bag .' . . here you simply take hold of a handle . . . and lift out an entire shelf. On that shelf are all the things required for the next eva period. So, it is one movement instead of a dozen.\u201d One tank of hydrogen and one tank of oxygen would be added to extend mission capability to I6V2 days. Since each eva period would increase up to 5 hrs and total lunar stay time would increase up to 200 hrs, lithium hydroxide would be increased for portable life-support system and for spacecraft, and insulation would Â£e increased on top of spacecraft around docking tunnel. Minor changes would be made to interior garments so crew would have more suitable environment and crew would remove spacesuits and sleep in hammocks during rest periods on lunar surface.

Other Oao II data indicated particles in interstellar space were variety of complex matter, much of which might be debris ejected from stars.

Faget outlined concept of space vehicle with two reusable stages\u2014booster rocket and orbiter craft\u2014both with fixed wings, long fuselages, and rear rocket engines. Vehicle would be 225 ft high and weigh 2.5 million lbs at launch. Orbiter vehicle, capable of carrying 25,000 lbs of cargo and passengers, would be attached pickaback to booster stage\u2019s upper half. Booster, burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, would elevate orbiter to fringe of space, separate, drop away, and cruise to landing like jet airliner. Booster probably would be piloted by two astronauts. Orbiter would ignite rocket engine to continue upward to space station orbiting at 300-mi altitude. After link-up with space station, transfer of cargo or 12 passengers, and pickup of new load, orbiter would be steered by pilot into atmosphere and controlled glide to landing on 10,000-ft runways used by aircraft. Key to reentry would be orbiter\u2019s \u201cangle of attack\u201d when hitting atmosphere. Faget proposed 60Â° angle with nose up, so flattened bottom would catch airflow to slow descent. Small jet engines would be fired to help control final descent phases of both orbiter and booster. Outer surface of vehicles would be made of metal alloys that could sustain temperatures to 2,700Â°F.

      "story": " Press conference on preliminary science results of Biosatellite III (launched June 28) was held at NASA Hq. Spacecraft, carrying male macaque monkey Bonny, had been launched on 30-day mission to investigate physiological problems during space flight but had been deorbited after 8% days when monkey\u2019s condition deteriorated. John W. Dyer, Manager of Biosatellite Project Operations at arc, said all of automatically controlled functions performed \u201cbeautifully\u201d after launch and spacecraft and instrumentation performed well throughout mission. \u201cThe animal was reported to be enthusiastically eating and drinking, and after four or five days, a routine operation capable of going the duration of on-board consumables was projected.\u201d Clear data on Bonny and entire flight system were recorded at 16 stations in 180 intervals of 5 to 10 min each and good quality data were returned from onboard tape and film records recovered with capsule. Bonny remained alert until eighth day, providing much new information on cycles of sleep and wakefulness at zero g. Dr. W. Ross Adey of UCLA, principal experimenter, said one important discovery was alterations in circadian rhythms, daily rhythms in physiological functions. \u201cAt least it is clear that if there is not an actual prolongation of the rhythms there is a very significant phase shift so that the animal woke later and later each day.\u201d Most interesting discovery about sleep patterns was that dream sleep, which constituted 20% of normal night\u2019s sleep on earth and was characterized by rapid eye movements (rem), occurred in space. \u201cIt had never been clear in space whether man or animals have this REM sleep, and there is evidence that decreased gravitational inputs, or decreased inputs from the body will seriously disrupt it. So we were very interested to see that REM sleep in the monkey . . . that there was indeed a great deal of sleep of this rem type, and that it occurred in ... an intermediate stage of sleep.\u201d One of first abnormalities noted in Bonny was pendular eye movement, swinging movement that occurred when vestibular mechanism in inner ear was disturbed. Fluid was moving in some fashion that might indicate pressure or cooling if it occurred on earth. \u201cNone of these conditions applied here. But the weightlessness would allow movements of the fluid which were probably unusual. . . . This is interesting because the Apollo astronauts who have now much more room to move around than in . . . the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft have . . . almost uniformly reported some degree of vestibular disturbances.\u201d By eighth day, brain and body temperature and central venous pressure had dropped dangerously. Fluid loss by sweating and diuresis was high, apparently because of redistribution of blood in visceral pools from weightlessness. On recovery Bonny was semicomatose and his temperature was below 35Â°C. Immediate resuscitation measures with intravenous fluid were begun and monkey\u2019s condition improved substantially. \u201cThe temperature came up to about 35.8, the heart rate stabilized, and the blood pressure came up. . . . And the animal was lifting his head . . . and making coordinated movements with all four limbs. And then quite suddenly, about twelve hours after recovery, a condition of ventricular fibrillation ensued. It came on very suddenly, and the heartbeat became totally disordered, And there was no recovery. This is a common occurrence in monkeys of this species when recovering from hypothermia . . . and death is almost a certainty.\u201d Autopsy revealed 20% loss in body weight, much higher than 3%\u20148% reported for astronuats in early days of flights. Restraint, weightlessness, and decreased feedback from peripheral structures had decreased shivering response, and monkey had failed to respond to falling temperature with normal thermogenic response. Restraint and, particularly, weightlessness had led to pooling of blood in thorax and abdomen, raising central venous pressures and leading to loss of fluid through kidney and sweating. Dr. Adey said mission was \u201chighly successful in revealing physiological effects of weightlessness in spite of the reduced duration of the experiment\u201d and indicated \u201cgreat value of carefully designed animal experiments in collection of important biomedical data relevant to manned flight.\u201d Virtually every piece of information that could be drawn about manned space flight indicated similar changes in astronauts, though to smaller degree, he said. Scientists still did not know whether gravity was necessary for long-duration space flights. \u201cTherefore, I think it is premature to consider the design of space platforms or the larger space stations until we know more from the biomedical point of view about what is absolutely necessary.\u201d President\u2019s Science Advisory Committee report to President Nixon, being printed, would say necessary biomedical basis for elaborate space platforms and space stations did not exist in NASA or in scientific community.

In requesting retirement, Dr. Silverstein wrote: \u201cAs NASA engages in its second ten-year program, it may be important that the men whose decisions initiate the new long-range projects be available to complete them. Since I do not think I can stretch my 40 years of service into 50, it is perhaps best ... if I bow out now.\u201d Few have made so great a contribution to our national space effort,\u201d Dr. Paine said. Dr. Silverstein had been first Director of Space Flight Programs in NASA Hq. in 1958. Under his leadership first U.S. man-in-space program, Project Mercury, had been planned and groundwork laid for Gemini and Apollo programs. He had joined NASA at Langley Aeronautical Laboratory in 1929 and helped design and later was in charge of Full-Scale Wind Tunnel. Transferring to Lewis Laboratory in 1943, he was responsible for conception, design, and construction of first U.S. supersonic-propulsion wind tunnels. After three years with NASA Hq., 1958\u20141961, he returned to LeRC as Director. Lundin had served NASA since 1943, when he joined staff at Lewis. In 1961 he was appointed Associate Director for Development. In May 1968 he went to NASA Hq. as Deputy Associate Administrator for oart.

That is, NASA should pursue a biomedical program which explores the optimization of man\u2019s role in space, the limitations on his effectiveness and means to circumvent those limitations ... a program to determine the best use of man as a space subsystem in interaction with automated subsystems. An effective program directed to this objective exceeds the present capabilities of NASA and involves resources not yet developed in the biomedical community.\u201d Report criticized NASA for not implementing previous recommendations toward strong biomedical research capability. \u201cPressures for early and reasonably certain success led to placing primary emphasis initially on validation of the capability to construct, orbit, and recover manned spacecraft, with long-range, scientific goals in the biomedical field set aside as potentially interfering with flight objectives. Scientific requirements were thus deemphasized at the very time when development of basic scientific knowledge and a cadre of scientific talent should have been begun.\u201d NASA was now faced \u201cwith the question of qualifying man for more complex tasks in space, for longer duration flights, and of evaluating man as an integral part of the spacecraft man-machine system, without sound biomedical foundation.\u201d In particular, \u201cdecisions concerning development directions for the next generation of manned spacecraft systems for use in earth orbit must be made without an adequate basis of understanding.\u201d NASA should plan overall biomedical program using resources, personnel, and experience of other Government areas, especially dod, and support multidisciplinary environmental medical laboratories within universities.

NASA should affiliate biologically and medically trained astronauts with research components of NASA or qualified institutions. They should be assigned to msc flight-crew organization only when participating in specific missions.

Seconds into flight an electrical discharge shut down the spacecraft fuel cells, but the astronauts corrected the condition. 10,000\tft with tops at 21,000 ft. During ascent observers on ground saw two parallel streaks of lightning flash between clouds and launch pad. NASA reported electrical transients, later attributed to electrical potential discharges from clouds through spacecraft to ground, had suddenly shut off spacecraft\u2019s electrical power at 00:36 get and turned on numerous alarms in cm. Spacecraft automatically switched to backup battery power while crew restored primary power system. Commander Conrad radioed, \u201cWe had everything in the world drop out.\u201d Control Center commented, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of cardiac arrests down here, too.\u201d \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time up here,\u201d Conrad answered. Power system remained normal throughout rest of mission. Spacecraft entered planned parking orbit with 118-mi (189.9-kra) apogee and 115.0-mi (185.0-km) perigee. After postlaunch checkout CSM. separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S-IVB) and LM, code-named Intrepid, Onboard TV initiated after separation clearly showed csm transposing and docking with lm at 3:27 GET and ice on windows from rain frozen during liftoff. Crew ejected CSm/lm from S\u2014IYB and conducted first SPS burn for translunar insertion. Slingshot maneuver placed S\u2014IVB into earth orbit with 515,549.4-\tto 560,429.9-mi {829,519.0- to 901,731.7-km) apogee and 93,213.2-\tto 109,324.1-mi (149,980.0- to 175,902.5-km) perigee and period of 39 to 45 days, instead of heliocentric orbit planned, because of error in instrument unit. To ensure that electrical transients during launch had not affected lm systems, Conrad and Bean entered LM at 7:20 GET for housekeeping and systems checks. All checks indicated systems were satisfactory, Translunar insertion maneuver was so accurate that midcourse maneuver No. 1 was not necessary. Midcourse correction No. 2, at 30:53 GET, placed spacecraft on desired hybrid circumlunar trajectory with closest approach of 69.1 mi; third and fourth maneuvers were not necessary. Good-quality TV coverage of preparations for and performance of midcourse maneuver was transmitted for 47 min. Conrad and Bean began transfer to LM during translunar coast Y2 hr earlier than planned to obtain full TV coverage through Goldstone tracking station. The 56-min transmission, beginning at 62:52 get, showed excellent color pictures of GSM, intravehicular transfer, LM interior, earth, and moon. Gordon reported crew was in good condition. TV broadcast scheduled for 81:30 GET before lunar orbit insertion was canceled because of sun angle and glare on spacecraft windows. Spacecraft entered lunar orbit with 194.3-mi (312.6-km) apolune and 72.0-mi (115.9-km) perilune at 83:25 GET (10:47 pm est Nov. 17) after first sps burn. During first lunar orbit good quality TV coverage of lunar surface was transmitted for 33 min. Crew provided excellent descriptions of lunar features. Second SPS burn circularized orbit with 76.1-mi (122.5-km) apolune and 62.5-mi (100.6-km) perilune at 87:47 get. Conrad and Bean transferred to lm for l^g-hr housekeeping, voice and telemetry test, and oxygen-purge-system check and then returned to CM. CM Yankee Clipper, reported sighting Surveyor III and Intrepid on moon. Conrad opened lm hatch at 115:11 GET, descended LM ladder, and deployed modularized equipment stowage assembly (mesa) containing camera which recorded his descent to lunar surface. Conrad reported seeing Surveyor HI spacecraft and said lm had landed 25 ft down-range from lip of crater. Conrad, inches shorter than Neil A. Armstrong, who had stepped onto moon July 21, had difficulty taking last step from ladder. When he touched lunar surface at 115.22 get (6:44 am est Nov. 19) Conrad said, \u201cWhoopee! Man, that may have been a small step for Neil, but that\u2019s a long one for me.\u201d He said lunar surface was soft and loosely packed, causing his boots to dig in as he walked, and sun was bright like a spotlight, lm had landed so gently its shock-absorbing legs were barely telescoped by gentle impact. Conrad recorded Bean\u2019s descent to lunar surface at 115:52 get (7:14 am EST Nov. 19). Shortly after color TV camera was removed from mesa bracket, transmission was lost and was not regained for remainder of eva. Crew collected 40- to 50-lb contingency sample and reported mounds resembling volcanoes. Mounds were 4 ft high with flattened tops 5 ft wide and sides sloping out to 15- to 20-ft dia. Conrad said he saw neither breccia nor vesicular rocks, only basalts. Lithium hydroxide canisters and contingency sample were transferred to lm ; S-band antenna, solar wind composition experiment, and American flag were deployed as planned, alsep with SNAP\u201427 atomic generator was deployed 600\u2014700 ft from lm. Shortly after deployment passive seismometer transmitted to earth signals from astronauts\u2019 footsteps as they returned to lm. During deployment astronauts kicked up dust and some adhered to instruments. Overall effect would be determined through long-term measurements of system\u2019s engineering parameters. Conrad and Bean dusted each other off and entered Intrepid after 3 hrs 56 min walking on lunar surface. After resting inside lm and checking plans for second eva period, astronauts left lm at 131:33 get (10:55 pm est Nov. 19), 1 hr 40 min ahead of schedule. Astronauts stored lm TV camera in equipment transfer bag for return to earth for failure analysis. Conrad walked to alsep site to check leveling of lunar atmosphere detector. Astronaut movement on surface was recorded on passive seismometer and lunar surface magnetometer, eva traverse took crew to alsep deployment site, Head Crater, Bench Crater, Sharp Crater, Halo Crater, Surveyor III site, Block Crater, and back to lm. Astronauts walked 1,500\u20142,000 ft from lm, covering about 6,000-ft distance, their confidence and speed increasing with experience. After walk Conrad reported he had fallen once but Bean had picked him up without difficulty. Conrad rolled grapefruit-sized rock down wall of Head Crater about 300\u2014400 ft from passive seismometer, but no significant response was detected. Crew obtained desired photographic panoramas, core samples, trench sample, lunar environment sample, and assorted rock, dirt, bedrock, and molten samples. They reported fine dust buildup on all sides of larger rocks and said soil color lightened as depth increased. Crew reported Surveyor footpad marks were still visible and entire spacecraft looked brown, as if something had rained on it. Glass parts were not broken. Crew retrieved parts of Surveyor III, including TV camera and soil scoop. They then retrieved solar wind composition experiment and stowed it in equipment bag, took stereo pictures near lm, and transferred all collected samples, parts, and equipment to lm. They dusted off, reentered LM, and jettisoned equipment according to plan, closing hatch by 134:82,get (2:44 am EST Nov. 20), after 3 hrs 49 min walking on lunar surface in second eva period. While lm was on moon Gordon, orbiting moon in csm, completed lunar multispectral photography experiment and photographed Wall of Theophilus and future landing sites, Fra Mauro and Descartes. Film would be analyzed to aid scientists in planning for future sample collection and in extrapolating known compositions from returned samples to parts of moon that would not be visited. At 142:04 get (9:26 am est Nov. 20) lm successfully lifted off moon after 31 hrs 31 min on lunar surface, leaving lm descent stage. Astronauts brought back 95 lbs of lunar surface samples, parts of Surveyor III, films, and miniature flags of 136 nations, 50 U.S. states, and 4 U.S. possessions. A 1.2-sec overburn of lm ascent propulsion system caused by incorrect manual switching sequence prevented automatic shutdown of engine and resulted in insertion velocity 32 fps greater than planned, placing lm in orbit with 71.4-mi (114.9-km) apolune and 10.6-mi (17.1-km) perilune. Crew quickly recognized discrepancy, manually shut down engine, and used RSC trim maneuver to enter planned orbit with 53.3-mi (85.8-km) apolune and 10.1-mi (16.3-km) perilune. Rendezvous maneuvers occurred as planned and lm docked with csm at 145:36 get (12:58 pm est Nov. 20). TV was transmitted from csm for last 24 min of rendezvous sequence. Crew transferred with samples, equipment, and film to CSM; lm ascent stage was jettisoned and intentionally crashed onto lunar surface at 5:17 pm est Nov. 20 about 44.9 mi (72.2 km) southeast of Surveyor III. Crash was detected by seismometer left on moon and produced reverberations lasting for more than 30 min. Crew made csm plane-change maneuver at 159:05 GET and took high-resolution and stereo-strip photos and tracked landmarks, to conclude planned photography of Fra Mauro, Descartes, and Lalande. antine facility (mqf) with recovery physician and technician. Crew, physician, and technician remained inside mqf until it was delivered to Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston. cm was retrieved and mated to MQF transfer tunnel on board recovery ship. From inside MQF/cm containment envelope, MQF engineer removed lunar samples and equipment through decontamination lock and cm was sealed until delivery to LRL. Sample return containers, film, and other data were flown to Pago Pago and to Houston for transport to LRL. Primary Apollo 12 mission objectives\u2014to perform selenological inspection, survey, and sampling of mare area, deploy and activate ALSEP, develop techniques for point landing capability, develop man\u2019s capability to work in lunar environment, and obtain photos of candidate exploration sites\u2014were achieved. All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed according to plan, with only minor and corrected discrepancies. Flight crew performance was outstanding. All three crew members remained in excellent health and good spirits. Accomplishments included first use of hybrid trajectory, largest U.S. payload placed into lunar orbit (72,335 ibs after lunar orbit insertion), first demonstration of point landing capability, first use of two EVA periods, first recharge of portable life-support system, first double-core-tube sample, first return of samples from vehicle previously landed on moon, longest distance traversed on lunar surface, first multispectral photography from lunar orbit, and longest lunar mission to date. Apollo 12 was ninth Apollo mission to date, sixth manned Apollo mission, and second manned lunar landing mission. Apollo 11 (July 16\u201424, 1969) had proved capability to perform manned landing on moon and return and to retrieve lunar samples for study on earth.

In a way, it will be like being there when Darwin traveled around the world and made the observations that resulted in his theory of evolution or when Lewis and Clark explored the Northwest. Not too much should be expected from any one trip or any one set of experiments. It is the totality of knowledge, not its fragments, that counts.\u201d (W Post, 11/15/69, A20)",

During this period, senior NASA officials in testimony before the Congress estimated the cost ... at between $20 and $40 billion.\u201d Estimate was refined to approximately $19.5 billion in March 1964, with assumption \u201cthere would be a timely initiation of a follow-on program which would bear a portion of the relatively fixed cost required to develop and sustain this national capability.\u201d Estimates then and annual reassessments had reflected total program cost, including cost of initial lunar landing. Lunar objective \u201cwas not simply an end in itself but, rather, provided the focus for the effort to attain space supremacy for whatever the national interest required.\u201d In March 1966 NASA had furnished estimate of $22,718 billion based on assumption that there would not be timely initiation of follow-on program. In April 1969 NASA furnished estimate of $23,877 billion, which would still be valid if negative assumption had materialized. \u201cBut with the success of Apollo 11, we have the opportunity to utilize this demonstrated capability in a more meaningful way. By improving payloads and modifying spacecraft to increase lunar surface systems, we can enhance significantly the return of scientific data from both lunar orbit and the lunar surface.\u201d NASA had met national commitment \u201cat a cost nearer the lower end of the range of estimates\u201d despite \u201cunpredictable substantial inflationary conditions.\u201d Actual cost accrued through July 31, 1969, was $21.35 billion, of which $2 billion was value of flight hardware available for future flights.

The transonic speed range is also critical for a supersonic transport because performance in this range determines subsonic cruise efficiency. Transonic speed characteristics are important to fighter aircraft because they are required to maneuver at these speeds, and they are important to bomber aircraft because they affect the engine size which is necessary to accelerate to higher supersonic speeds. ... It is in this speed range that many interactions, shock waves, and flow separations occur that become important to the thrust, drag, and stall margin of the engine and on the lift, drag and buffet characteristics of the aircraft. Unfortunately, mathematical prediction techniques do not work well in this speed range and experimental testing becomes of major importance.\u201d Only very small models could be used in transonic tunnels \u201cand scaling up results from very small models to full size airplanes is at best difficult and usually impossible.

I apparently either pointed it at the sun or pointed it at the mesa, which was in the sun and a pretty bright reflector . . . and just that few seconds . . . was enough to sunburn the camera. ... I didn\u2019t realize it was as sensitive to light as it is.\u201d Dust on surface was a major problem, Conrad said. Ground was soft and astronauts sank in significantly. It was difficult to keep experiment package clean. \u201cIt was almost impossible for us to walk around those packages without our little dust cloud and at any time the dust hit the surface of the package it stuck and the worst thing you could do was try to rub it off because you just smeared it over them even worse. . . .\u201d To question about difficulty in landing LM on moon, Conrad replied he had misinterpreted correct gage reading and underestimated accuracy of LM\u2019s descent. \u201c. . . I felt that that gage was not . . . giving me the proper information. I found it quite hard to believe that I could have gotten the velocity killed quite as well as I did . . . and so I was continually going out the window to get roll information and a general idea of my lateral and horizontal velocities.\u201d Although Conrad felt landing on moon was not \u201can amateur\u2019s game,\u201d he felt satisfactory landings under completely instrumented flight rule conditions could be made. Crew had suggested adding instrument that would provide automatic nulling of horizontal and lateral velocities but would leave pilot with rate of descent command. Conrad said he did not think dust during descent would be problem on future missions \u201cas long as you get a look at your landing site before you get into the dust, and ascertain that it\u2019s all right\u2014it\u2019s perfectly all right to go in and land, IFR. ...

Temperature profile measured by Mariner VI near equator in daytime indicated temperatures in stratosphere about 100Â°K warmer than those predicted by theory. Measurements by Mariner VI taken at 79Â°N at beginning of polar night indicated conditions were favorable for condensation of carbon dioxide at almost all altitudes. Mariner VII measurements taken at 58Â°S in daytime and 38Â°N at night also showed carbon dioxide condensation was possible at altitudes above about 15.5 mi (25 km). Measurements of electron density in ionosphere showed upper atmosphere was substantially warmer than in 1965, possibly because of increased solar activity and proximity to sun.

      "story": " In American Scholar architect R. Buckminster Fuller said: \u201cIt seems eminently clear that we not only must put our space programs on highest priority of attention and resource investment but that all humanity must be accredited and financed to enter into a new re-educational system that is geared to develop our most prominent awareness, that we indeed are in space and that all of our concern is with the fact that our space-vehicle Earth and its life-energy-giving Sun, and the tide-pumping Moon can provide ample sustenance and power for all humanity\u2019s needs to be derived from our direct energy income without further robbing our fossil fuels energy savings account. In reality, the Sun, the Earth and the Moon are nothing else than a most fantastically well-designed and space-programmed team of vehicles. All of us are, always have been, and so long as we exist, always will be\u2014nothing else but\u2014astronauts. Let\u2019s pull our heads out of the brain benumbing, mind frustrating, misinformedly conditioned reflexes. If it is going to be \u2018All ashore who\u2019s going ashore,\u2019 once more intent to return to nonspace down here ON earth, humanity is doomed.\u201d (American Scholar, Winter 1969-70, 27-47) During 1969: In 1969\u2014the year man first set foot on another celestial body \u2014U.S. orbited 54 spacecraft and U.S.S.R., 70. U.S. total included 31 orbited by DOD. NASA\u2019s 23 included 2 satellites orbited for dod as secondary payloads. Highlight of 1969 was achievement of major goal in NASA\u2019s Apollo program\u2014to land man on the moon and return him safely to earth. Lunar landing system completed final phases of test and demonstration when Apollo 9 demonstrated operation of LM in earth orbit and Apollo 10 demonstrated operation of complete Apollo spacecraft in lunar orbit, with LM making two passes within 47,000 ft of lunar surface. Apollo program climaxed with Apollo 11, July 16\u201424, when LM Eagle landed on moon and Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. \u2014first men on the moon\u2014performed tasks on lunar surface, redocked with csm in lunar orbit, and returned safely to earth with lunar samples. Apollo 12 successfully accomplished second manned lunar landing with pinpoint accuracy, touching down close to Surveyor 111, which had landed on moon April 19, 1967. Crew set up first alsep on lunar surface and returned safely to earth with lunar samples and parts of Surveyor III. Unmanned Mariner VI and Mariner VII passed within 2,000 mi of Mars, transmitting more than 200 times more data about Mars than were obtained by Mariner IV in 1964. Spacecraft measured chemical composition and temperature of atmosphere and surface and took 198 high-quality pictures, providing new insight into Mars surface characteristics. Other scientific achievements included orbiting of Oso V, Oso VI, Ogo VI, and Explorer XL1. Applications satellites included Intelsat-Ill F\u20143, Intelsat-III F\u20144, and Intelsat-III F\u20145 for ComSat-Corp; Essa IX meteorological satellite for essa; Nimbus III; and Ats V. Biosatellite 111 provided significant biological data on instrumented monkey on board, but mission was terminated early after monkey\u2019s physiological condition deteriorated, and monkey died shortly after recovery. Pioneer E, scheduled to enter solar orbit, and its secondary payload tetr\u2014c were destroyed shortly after launch when Delta booster malfunctioned. Some 189 meteorological sounding rockets, 85 scientific sounding rockets, and 60 high-altitude balloons were launched. NASA\u2014usaf XB\u201470 and X\u201415 programs were concluded and new joint program was initiated to continue aeronautical R&d, using YF\u201412 supersonic aircraft. First operational C\u20145A, military cargo transport and world\u2019s largest aircraft, was delivered to usaf and by November seven C\u20145As had accumulated 1,320 hrs flying time. Aeronautical R&d continued to improve quality and quantity of options available in aircraft technology, and aircraft industry made first flights of several wide-bodied jumbo jet transports for civil use, including Boeing 747. New SST design with delta wing was approved by faa and prototype construction was recommended by President Nixon. NASA\u2019s HL\u201410 lifting-body vehicle completed 3 successful glide flights and 15 powered flights included first supersonic flight at mach 1.1 and 54,000-ft altitude, usaf\u2019s X\u201424A lifting-body vehicle completed 7 flights. dod space program included orbiting of 2 Vela nuclear-detection satellites, 7 Orbiting Vehicle research satellites, Tacsat I tactical comsat, Egrs XIII (Secor XIII) geodetic satellite (launched by NASA), and U.K.\u2019s Skynet A comsat (launched by NASA). Titan HIM development was terminated and usaf\u2019s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) program was canceled because of budget cutbacks. NASA and aec completed ground tests of xe experimental rocket engine with 28 successful startups and 2.8 hrs of operation, including 3.5\tmin at full thrust, and validated test stand No. 1 in Jackass Flats, Nev. SNAP\u201427 generator was used as electrical power source for Apollo 12 experiments left on moon and SNAP\u201419 was auxiliary power system for Nimbus III. SNAP\u201429 program was terminated. New liquid-propellant rocket engine was developed and new triprapellant system produced record performance for chemically powered engines. U.S.S.R.\u2019s 70 payloads included 55 Cosmos satellites and 2 Intercosmos, 2 Meteor, 1 Luna, 1 Zond, 5 Soyuz, and 2 Venus spacecraft, and 2 Molniya I comsats. Manned Soyuz IV docked with manned Soyuz V and two cosmonauts transferred from Soyuz V to Soyuz IV before returning to earth. Manned Soyuz VI, VII, and VIII, launched on three successive days, rendezvoused in orbit and performed experiments including photography, communications, and welding. Luna XV, apparent unmanned challenger to NASA\u2019s Apollo 11 for first lunar landing and return, crashed onto lunar surface in July. U.S.S.R.\u2019s Tu-144 delta-wing supersonic transport successfully reached speeds up to 900 mph and was demonstrated publicly in 90-min test flight.

      "story": " Year 1969 was one of critical decision and realignment of programs for NASA as primary goal of first decade was achieved through Apollo program. Post-Apollo planning had preceded the coming of the Nixon Administration and Apollo 11. Budget retrenchment accelerated throughout Government as cost of Vietnam war continued high and White House sought to lessen inflation by fiscal economy. Nationwide reevaluation of societal; priorities emphasized problems of pollution, poverty, and crime. Successful lunar landings of Apollo 11 and 12\u2014seen and acclaimed worldwide\u2014mushroomed U.S. enthusiasm for manned space achievement. NASA announced development of plans for further lunar missions and post-Apollo planetary exploration. But year was turning point, with completion of a major goal and examination of possible new goals and priorities for the next decade. Phasing down of Apollo program after climax brought shifts in program emphasis and in personnel. Most of initial Saturn V launch vehicles had been completed. Hardware requirements would decrease as missions slowed. Peak costs during 1960s had built NASA base of people, technology, and facilities as national capability to conduct space missions. Future space objectives and budget options were examined, within Government and outside, for .balance between more manned missions and more unmanned scientific exploration and applications of knowledge already gained. Criticism of past emphasis on engineering rather than on science was partly answered by decision to provide more time for scientific study and planning between the next Apollo lunar missions. Program plans included Apollo Applications, missions to Mars and Jupiter, long-range studies of Venus-Mercury mission and three-planet grand tours, development of permanent space station, joint NASA\u2014DOD studies of space transportation system with reusable shuttle, and accelerated aeronautics activities. nasa FY 1970 appropriation of $3,697 billion was $181 million below budget proposed by outgoing President Johnson and $19 million below President Nixon\u2019s amended request for $3,716 billion. Cutbacks in Government spending forced NASA to announce 1970 closing of Electronics Research Center and DOD to cancel Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) program. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, told ERC employees in December that agency had to \u201ceffect reductions and consolidation across the board if we are to shape our programs to meet the nation\u2019s future needs in aeronautics and space.\u201d Reductions in work force\u2014largely in contractor personnel\u2014were brought by planned phasing out of Apollo program as well as by budget cuts. Year of man\u2019s first landing on moon, despite its global impact, ended with space goals and levels of effort for the next decade an open question. (Pres Rpt 70 [69]; A&A 69)",

      "story": " In its international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched three foreign satellites\u2014Canadian Isis /, third of series to conduct ionospheric measurement; Boreas (Esro IB) for European Space Research Organization on reimbursable basis; and West German Azur under cooperative project to conduct radiation belt measurements. Agreements for new projects were reached with U.K., Italy, Netherlands, and Canada. U.K. agreement called for 1971 launch of satellite on NASA Scout vehicle to measure ionospheric particles and radio noise and experiment to fly on board NASA\u2019s Nimbus-E in 1972. Italian agreement provided for 1970 launch of San Marco-C satellite on NASA Scout vehicle from Italian San Marco range in Indian Ocean and use of range for launching NASA spacecraft into equatorial orbit. Under Netherlands agreement two Dutch scientists would participate as observers in OAO program. Canadian agreement called for reimbursement launching of Canadian comsat. Project Helios, cooperative endeavor with West German Ministry for Scientific Research to place two solar probes (1974\u20141975) closer to sun than any other spacecraft, would obtain data on solar processes and earth-sun relationship. Under another agreement with West Germany, Project Aeros, NASA would launch German-developed satellite in 1972 for aeronomy measurements. In agreement with Indian space agency, ATS\u2014F satellite would be made available for experimental educational TV broadcasting directly and by relay to receivers in 5,000 Indian villages. Additional cooperative projects during 1969 included launch of one Italian, two U.K., and two French experiments; continuation of sounding rocket projects with Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, and Sweden; inclusion of Canadian and French experiments on Convair 990 flights to study auroras in northern latitudes; and extension of aeronautical research projects with Canada, France, West Germany, and U.K. Agreement with Spain for NASA Madrid tracking station was extended in June until 1984 and negotiations were begun with Australia for extension of tracking arrangements until same year. Lunar surface material returned by Apollo 11 astronauts was distributed to 39 principal investigators from nine countries\u2014Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, West Germany, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, and U.K. International highlights in 1969 included around-the-world tour of Apollo 11 astronauts to dramatize conviction that successful lunar landing was triumph for all mankind; travels of NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, to inform ministerial and space agency officials abroad of U.S. space plans and invite their participation; and participation of foreign experts in NASA conference on space shuttle concepts. Efforts by NASA to develop cooperative programs with U.S.S.R. continued during 1969, but met with limited success. (Pres Rpt 70 [69])",
