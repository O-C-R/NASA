NASA dedicated a new aerospace laboratory at Anne Beers Elementary School in Washington, DC, featuring a simulated Shuttle cockpit and Mission Control Center. NASA had named the facility, designed to encourage student interest in space exploration, for U.S. Representative Louis Stokes (D-OH), who had proposed legislation to fund the endeavor in 1998. NASA’s GRC and Goddard Space Flight Center had worked with the Orchard Glenn School of Cleveland, Ohio, and the University of the District of Columbia to construct the innovative facility.(NASA, “Aerospace Laboratory Encourages Students To Reach for the Stars with NASA Help,” news release m00-051, 15 March 2000.)
NASA Director of Media Services Brian D. Welch died after suffering a heart attack. Welch, who had led many of NASA’s public outreach efforts, was responsible for its news operations, for NASA Television, and for NASA’s Internet efforts. Welch had begun his career as a cooperative-education student of public affairs at LARC in 1979. In 1981 he had become editor of Space News Roundup, the newspaper of NASA’s JSC. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Welch had worked as a public affairs mission commentator, Deputy News Chief at Mission Control Center, Manager of JSC’s Mission Commentary Team, and Newsroom Manager during Shuttle flights. NASA had appointed Welch as Chief of News and Information in 1994, and he had become Director of Media Services in 1998. Administrator Daniel S. Goldin spoke of how Welch’s sudden death had stunned NASA, saying that Welch’s “love and enthusiasm for spaceflight and exploration” was “infectious,” and describing Welch’s passionate approach to his work as the true embodiment of “the spirit of this agency.”(NASA, “Brian Welch, NASA Director of Media Services, Dies,” news release 00-187, 27 November 2000, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2000/00-187.txt (accessed 7 April 2008).)
