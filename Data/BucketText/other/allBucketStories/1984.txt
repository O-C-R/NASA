Spacelab 3 investigators, engineers, support personnel, and science crew members completed the first integrated Spacelab 3 mission simulation at MSFC. Mission participants would take part in several such simulations in preparation for the scheduled January 1985 mission. The payload and mission specialists were located at the Marshall Center Payload Crew Training Complex for the simulation. They communicated and worked with mission management and science team members in a simulated Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) at the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC). Spacelab 3 mission manager Joe Cremin said that the primary purpose of the simulation “was to train the principal investigator operation teams in the Phyload Operations Control Center procedures with the Marshall Center POCC cadre.” The simulation also provided the participants with communications experience in an operational environment. An additional simulation would take place at Marshall in September, and in November the Marshall team would begin operations and simulations at the POCC at JSC. “Even then, the flight crew will be at Marshall to use the Payload Crew Training Complex and the HOSC will be active in providing support for the simulation,” Cremin said.
