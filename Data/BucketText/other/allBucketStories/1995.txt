Images from the international Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) may help researchers find previously unknown settlements near the ancient city of Angkor in Cambodia. The radar data was obtained during the October flight of the Space Shuttle Endeavour. SRL�s complementary radars, the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR), is a joint mission of the United States, German and Italian space agencies.

NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin released a statement regarding the effects of the proposed five-year, $2.7 billion reduction. He essentially stated that the House of Representatives� FY96 budget resolution assumes massive cuts in NASA�s efforts to study the Earth. It would turn an integrated global program into a series of disconnected and fundamentally less effective measurements. The cuts would cripple the core of the program, the Earth Observing System. The U.S. government-in partnership with scientists, private companies, and other nations must ensure that this cutting-edge research that is the foundation of Mission to Planet Earth is continued. While NASA is committed to prudent and permanent deficit reduction, further cuts to Mission to Planet Earth(and environmental research in general(seriously jeopardize an investment in the future that will return economic and quality of life benefits far in excess of what we spend today.

A new Mission Control center at the Johnson Space Center began operating about 10 hours after the launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery. It replaces the 30 year old Mission Control which began controlling manned space flights in Houston rather than at Cape Canaveral, Florida. A network of 200 computer work stations are replacing the lumbering and inflexible, but highly reliable mainframe computer. Launchings and landings, the most dangerous parts of space flight, will be monitored from the original Mission Control at least through the end of the year to be sure there are no glitches with the new center.

NASA has collaborated with WGBH-TV, Boston, and Scholastic, Inc., New York, to produce an interactive videodisc �Interactive NOVA: Earth� that allows students to go on electronic field trips to remote areas to find clues of how life began on Earth. NASA�s Offices of Mission to Planet Earth and Human Resources and Education contributed to this effort by providing data, visualizations, and other video resources as well as by actively participating in the current development through the involvement of key Agency researchers.

TRW received a contract to build two more Earth Orbiting System (EOS) spacecraft. EOS is the centerpiece of NASA�s Mission to Planet Earth, a long-term effort to study global climate changes. (Space News, Oct 9/95; AvWk, Sep 25/95)
