In 1989, NASA embarked on a vast program, the Mission to Planet Earth, which set out to monitor the effects of climate change on Earth's atmosphere, land surface, and oceans. The centerpiece of this program was to be the Earth Observing System, or EOPS, a group of 30,000-pound space platforms that could cost as much as $30 billion to build, launch, and operate. The platforms were projected to beam home one trillion bits of data each day, ranging from the flux of solar radiation into the atmosphere to the growth of plankton beneath the ocean surface.
NASA unveiled a $300 million radar system that can take color pictures of Earth's damaged environment from a Space Shuttle. According to NASA project scientist Diane Evans, "In many case, radar is the only way scientists can explore unaccessible regions on Earth's surface." The camera was scheduled to fly on the Shuttle three times, in 1994, 1995, and 1996. NASA and the German and Italian space agencies cooperated on the project. NASA paid half the cost. (AP, May 14/93)
Over the next two decades, NASA planned to launch more than two dozen satellites for its "Mission to Planet Earth." These satellites were scheduled to collect information about clouds, ocean circulation, and ice and pollution in order to help scientists refine their predictions of global warning.

NASA announced the formation of an International Mars Exploration Working Group. In addition to NASA, members included the European Space Agency, the Russian Space Research Institute, the Italian Space Agency, the German Space Agency, and the French Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. The group would focus on producing an international strategy for the exploration of Mars after the year 2000. (NASA Release 93-87)
