NASA awarded Philco-Ford Corp.’s Western Development Laboratories a $45,757,000, multiple-incentive contract modification for continued engineering and operational support at msc’s Mission Control Center (mcc) . (nasa Release 67-173)
Italian scientific satellite San Marco U lifts off from platform at sea off coast of Kenya, Africa, on four-stage Scout booster supplied by mas A. into equatorial orbit with 748-km (465-mi) apogee; 219-km (136-mi) perigee; 94-min period; and 2.9° inclination. The 285-lb satellite— first to be launched from a platform at sea—would measure air density by monitoring spacecraft’s drag forces and investigate ionospheric characteristics which interfered with long-range radio transmissions. San Marco II was second Italian satellite to be launched under May 31, 1962, cooperative agreement between NASA and Italian Space Commission (isc). First satellite, San Marco I, was successfully launched from NASA Wallops Station Dec. 15, 1964. San Marco was a mutual program of NASA and isc with no exchange of funds. NASA supplied launch vehicle and provided personnel training and tracking and data acquisition services, isc was responsible for design, fabrication, and testing of payloads and for launching of satellite built by Centro Ricerche Aerospaziali (cra) of the Univ. of Rome, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 67-93; WS Release 67—17)
NASA and Italian Space Commission (isc) agreed to launch jointly Italy’s third San Marco satellite (San Marco C) from mobile launcher in Indian Ocean off the coast of Kenya, Africa. Spacecraft would measure air density by continuously monitoring spacecraft’s drag forces, investigate ionospheric characteristics which interfered with long-range radio transmission, and conduct other upper-atmosphere experiments in 1969 and 1970. San Marco project, provided for under May 31, 1962, cooperative agreement, was a mutual program of NASA and ISC with no exchange of funds. NASA supplied launch vehicle and provided personnel training and tracking and data acquisition services. ISC was responsible for design, fabrication, and testing of payload and for launching of satellite built by Centro Ricerche Aerospaziali (cra) of the Univ. of Rome. San Marco I was launched December 14, 1964, and San Marco II, April 26, 1967. (nasa Release 67-303; A&A, 67)
