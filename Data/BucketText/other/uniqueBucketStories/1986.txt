The European Space Agency's spacecraft Giotto encountered Halley's Comet as it passed within 335 miles of the body's nucleus. The craft transmitted pictures of the comet every four seconds up until two seconds and 930 miles away, when its camera was damaged by dust particles traveling 50 times the speed of a bullet. These were the closest pictures by far taken of the Comet. Multinational scientists at the West German control center were jubilant about data gathered by sophisticated instruments. The mission was the most spectacular taken on by the European Space Agency, and the international cooperation `"among scientists was lauded by the media.
