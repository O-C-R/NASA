An ESA team of' 17 engineers arrived at MSFC to prepare for the first Spacelab launch on the Shuttle, now scheduled for September. Preparations would include extensive training and simulations with the Spacelab payload specialists, including two Europeans already based at MSFC and the NASA payload-operations engineers supporting NASA experiments on the mission. Several months before launch, the NASA/ESA team would begin to support operations from the payload-operations control center (POCC) at JSC. The ESA team had been working for five years on computer software and displays, crew procedures, experiment simulators to train the crew and the POCC team, and establishing a data base. The team, representing 6 different countries, would support experiments from 11 European countries. The 38 experiments on Spacelab 1 in five scientific disciplines would include 25 ESA experiments.
