Peter J. Wylie, professor of geology at the California Institute of Technology, commended NASA's mapping of Venus but stated that only 29 percent of the Earth's surface has been mapped in detail. He suggested that NASA's Mission to Planet Earth take the form of an integrated space-borne and ground-based mission that could map the remaining 71 percent of the surface beneath the ocean.

NASA released to Congress a report on the Restructuring of the Earth Observation System (EOS). The system is the centerpiece of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a coordinated program to study the Earth's environment as a complete global system and is composed of two series of spacecraft to collect data over 15 years. "The restructured EOS program meets the concerns for a less costly more flexible program while maintaining the science observations needed to support global change research," said Dr. Lennard A. Fisk, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications. (NASA Note N92-22)
Bill Townsend, Deputy Associate Administrator for NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, was quoted as saying that with NASA starting the new fiscal year with a smaller budget, the Space Radar Laboratory might have mapped its last mountain range. Diane Evans, the radar's U.S. project scientist, indicated that the world was waiting to see what NASA would do with the Space Radar Laboratory, which to date had mapped only 5 percent of the Earth's surface, in comparison with the extensive coverage of the topography of Venus.

An article criticized NASA for abandoning its big space plans and instead engaging in some rather abstruse scientific studies as a result of its Mission to Planet Earth. (W Post, Oct 26/94)
NASA Associate Administrator Charles Kennel visited the University of North Dakota's (UND) Center for Aerospace Science (CAS). Kennel was in charge of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, for which UND's Associate Dean George Seielstad said UND had a small contract. Kennel stated that CAS was well equipped and positioned to make data about the Earth available to nontraditional users. (Grand Forks Herald, Jun 23/94)
NASA has collaborated with WGBH-TV, Boston, and Scholastic, Inc., New York, to produce an interactive videodisc �Interactive NOVA: Earth� that allows students to go on electronic field trips to remote areas to find clues of how life began on Earth. NASA�s Offices of Mission to Planet Earth and Human Resources and Education contributed to this effort by providing data, visualizations, and other video resources as well as by actively participating in the current development through the involvement of key Agency researchers.

TRW received a contract to build two more Earth Orbiting System (EOS) spacecraft. EOS is the centerpiece of NASA�s Mission to Planet Earth, a long-term effort to study global climate changes. (Space News, Oct 9/95; AvWk, Sep 25/95)
