NASA announced it had selected General Electric Co., Valley Forge, Pa., to provide a Landsat-D mission system consisting of a flight segment (and backup) and a ground segment that would include a data management system, an operations control center, a Landsat assessment system, and a transportable ground station, all to be managed by GSFC. General Electric would fabricate the mission-unique equipment and integrate and test the flight segments, as well as build and install the ground segment in government facilities. Proposed cost of the cost-plus-award-fee contract was approximately $70.5 million, to cover the Landsat-D launch in late 1981 and early orbital operations. The thematic mapper (TM) in Landsat-Dâ€™s instrument module, a second-generation 7-band multispectral scanning radiometer with a ground resolution of about 30m (100ft), could extend the inventorying of earth resources. NASA had designed Landsat-D to improve activities such as crop forecasting, vegetation-health assessment, forest- and range-resources management, water-resources management, land-use mapping, and mineral exploration.
