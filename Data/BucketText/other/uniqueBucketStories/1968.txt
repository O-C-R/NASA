A 21.5-ft-dia, 40-ft-long mockup of Saturn V 3rd (S—IVB) stage was flown to msfc for crew station design review; it would be launched as 2nd stage of Saturn IB and as flight orbital workshop, with aluminum-grid partitions rearranged to create separate rooms. Modification provided two-story arrangement with separate rooms for sleeping, food preparation, and control center and large open laboratory area for experiments. (msfc Release 68—111
Simplified instrumentation technique using miniaturization, developed by NASA’s frc for monitoring pilots of XB—70 aircraft and wingless lifting-body vehicles, had been adapted to make possible almost instantaneous transmission of electrocardiograms taken of ambulance patients enroute to hospital doctors awaiting their arrival. In procedure taking total two minutes, data obtained from patient were flashed over ambulance radio to control center, relayed by telephone to cooperating hospital, and fed to ECG recorder. System had been successfully tested by a Los Angeles ambulance service for several months. (NASA Release 68—145; W Post, 8/15/68)	_
