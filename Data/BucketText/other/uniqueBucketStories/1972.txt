NASA announced it had asked Dept, of Health, Education, and Welfare to help select community for 1975 field-testing of NASA’s integrated medical and behavioral laboratory measurement system (imblms). Test would appraise technical requirements for remote health Care during long-duration space missions. If successful, it would also provide information and techniques to improve health care and medical services to remote earth areas. Data received at control center would enable physicians to diagnose conditions and prescribe treatment to trained paramedics at remote site. Joint NASA—hew Site Selection Working Group had developed requirements for test site. Group would evaluate community applications received by Dec. 4. Final decision on site would be made by about Dec. 5. (NASA Release 72-210)
