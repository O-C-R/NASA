Digital techniques would cope with “the coming world telecommunications explosion” and cut the cost of overseas transmissions as well, said INTELSAT Director General Santiago Astrain in his keynote address to the fifth international conference on satellite communications in Genoa, Italy. In the first use of the giant new Intelsat V (launched December 6, 1980, from Cape Canaveral into geostationary orbit 22,300 miles up), the speech was heard simultaneously in three countries. The telecast also marked INTELSAT’s first use of the 14/11 GHz frequency band. Receiving stations were two small 3-meter antennas at Genoa; a 10-meter torus antenna at COMSAT laboratories in Clarksburg, Md.; and 19-meter antenna at Goonhilly, England. (INTELSAT Release 81-5-1)
NASA launched SBS-B from the Eastern Space and Missile Center (ESMC) on a Delta at 7:09 p.m. EDT into a transfer orbit. Owned by Satellite Business Systems, Inc. (a consortium of IBM, Comsat General, and Aetna Insurance Company), the Hughes-built cylinder was second of four commercial communications satellites planned for launch by NASA at a fixed cost to SBS Inc. of $22 million. Called SBS 2 in orbit, the spin-stabilized communications satellite 660 centimeters high and 216 centimeters in diameter weighed 555 kilograms on station. It would be the first to offer routine commercial service in the K-band, 12-14 GHz.

NASA reported “encouraging initial results” from a two-month experiment that it conducted jointly with the FAA, National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Northwest Airlines. An instrument on Nimbus 7, called total ozone-mapping spectrometer, sent GSFC experimenters data on the total ozone profile in the atmosphere. Within three hours the GSFC scientists relayed the data, processed to indicate upper-air patterns and meteorological activity, such as rapidly moving fronts, to Northwest Airlines meteorologists in Minnesota for use in forecasting. Knowing the location of the fronts could help in avoiding them, both because they were associated with clear-air turbulence and because ozone encountered by airlines at high altitudes had caused shortness of breath as well as eye, nose, and throat irritation among airline passengers. Further research would lead to deduction of troposphere heights from total-ozone data for comparison with satellite temperature-sounding data. (NASA Release 81-90)
Science magazine said that Congress was in a “stir” because the administration planned to let a U.S. company sell materials for an advanced communications satellite to an Arab consortium that included the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Ford Aerospace would sell satellite parts to the French firm Aerospatiale, which was under contract to build three communications satellites for a group called Arabsat, composed of 22 governments, among them Libya, Syria, South Yemen, and the PLO. Libya has been “an avowed enemy” of the United States. The $135 million contract would cover satellites similar to but less sophisticated than the one Ford Aerospace was building for global communications system INTELSAT: Arabsat would offer 8,000 simultaneous twoway telephone conversations and one television channel. These services would cost less if bought directly from INTELSAT, but the Arab group apparently preferred to operate its own system. The matter came up November 3 during hearings before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, when Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said that he knew nothing about the deal; the next day, Secretary of State Alexander Haig also said that he knew nothing about it. The Arms Export Control Act required State Department approval of exports of high-tech items, even those having no direct military application. (Science, Nov 20/81, 891)
NASA launched Intelsat 5-CF3 from ESMC at 6:35 p.m. EST on an Atlas-Centaur into a highly elliptical transfer orbit with 35,953-kilometer apogee, 165.8-kilometer perigee, and 23.7° inclination. Firing of the apogee motor by INTELSAT would put it in geostationary orbit at 15 °E for tests by Telespazio at Fucino, Italy. It would later become the primary Atlantic communications satellite at 335.5°E, replacing Intelsat 5 FI, which would move to an Indian Ocean location at 62 °E to begin service next March after launch of another communications satellite as a spare. The two-ton F3, capable of 12,000 simultaneous telephone conversations plus two international color television channels, was third of the 5 and 5A series of 15 communications satellites planned by INTELSAT to handle international communications, such as telephone, telegrams, telex, data, and television.

After a series of delays, NASA launched GOES-E, fifth of a series of geostationary operational environmental satellites funded by NOAA, from the Eastern Space and Missile Center (ESMC) at 6:29 p.m. EDT on a Delta into a transfer orbit with 49,768-kilometer apogee, 192-kilometer perigee, 921-minute period, and 24.1° inclination. The craft would move into synchronous orbit at 85 °W by the first week of June for testing. The Hughes-built 875-pound satellite, Goes 5 in orbit, carried a new visible-infrared radiometric atmospheric sounder (VAS)—modified from the original visible-infrared spin-scan radiometer (VISSR) first carried by Goes 4 in September 1980—to provide not only visual imagery of Earth surface and cloud cover and infrared sea-surface temperature but also temperatures and amount, distribution, and movement of water vapor at various altitudes. Goes 5 would ultimately replace an older craft at 75 °W, now serving as “Goes East” to monitor the eastern United States and Canada, Central America, South America, and much of the Atlantic Ocean.

NASA declared the mission of Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 successful. Launched September 5 and August 20, 1977, each of the spacecraft had traveled more than 2.4 billion kilometers during the past four years and had conducted scientific investigations at seven major bodies of the solar system. They had made comparative studies of the Jupiter and Saturn systems, including their satellites, rings, and fields and particles environments. They had also measured characteristics of the interplanetary medium from Earth to Saturn. Achievements included: —acquiring more than 62,000 images from the outer solar system —discovering rings around Jupiter and unusual braiding, spokes, ringlets, and shepherding satellites in the rings of Saturn; new satellites of Jupiter and Saturn; lightning on Jupiter; eight active volcanoes on Io; and new sources of radio emissions in the Jupiter and Saturn systems —measuring atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and dynamics, magnetospheres; and particle environments of Jupiter, Saturn, and Titan.

The Soviet Union launched an Intercosmos-Bulgaria 3000 satellite into an orbit with 906-kilometer apogee, 825-kilometer perigee, 81.2° inclination, and 101.9-minute period. A Tass report said that the satellite would study ionsopheric plasma and high-energy charged-particle flux, magnetic fields, and upper-atmosphere glow in the ultraviolet and visible bands of spectrum. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria cooperated on the design of the craft and would continue to work together in data processing and analysis. (FBIS, Tass in English, Aug 7/81)
NASA launched Comstar-D, last of a series of four domestic communications satellites built by Hughes Aircraft for Comsat General, from KSC at 6:23 p.m. EST on an Atlas Centaur into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. The 6.1-mile (20-foot) high cylinder called Comstar 4 in orbit, weighing 1,516 kilograms (3,342 pounds) at launch, had 12 transponders (channels), each capable of relaying 1,500 two-way voice circuits (overall capability of 18,000	simultaneous high-quality two-way phone transmissions). A postlaunch report said the apogee motor firing February 23 was successful.

NASA launched RCA Satcom 4 from the ESMC on a Delta at 8:37 p.m. EST into a transfer orbit with 19,356-kilometer apogee, 100-kilometer perigee, and 25.5° inclination. The objective of the commercial communications satellite was to transmit video programs to cable television (CATV) systems throughout the United States. The 500-kilogram box-shaped craft, fourth in a series of large 24-transponder communications satellites, managed by a subsidiary of RCA, carried a payload-assist module (PAM) to put it into geosynchronous orbit at 132 °W, joining three other RCA satellites providing television, voice, and high-speed data to all 50 states and Puerto Rico. More than 4,000 Earth stations had direct access to these spacecraft. GSFC had project-management responsibility for the launch vehicle; RCA Americom, which managed the Satcom program, including spacecraft acquisition and tracking, telemetry, and command systems, would reimburse NASA $22 million for the launch and launch support.

The Soviet Union launched India’s satellite Bhaskara 2 into an orbit with 557-kilometer apogee, 514-kilometer perigee, 95.2-minute period, and 50.7° inclination. It carried television and microwave radiometers to study Earth’s natural resources. Tass said that India and USSR stations were receiving data. (FBIS, Tass in English, Nov 20/81)
NASA launched the U.S. Navy’s improved Transit navigational satellite Nova 1 at 2:07 a.m. from the Western Space and Missile Center (WSMC) on a Scout vehicle into a polar transfer orbit with 935-kilometer apogee, 353-kilometer perigee, 90.16° inclination, and 97.67-minute period. The solar panels deployed, and the payload was in a housekeeping mode. A multiple-burn spacecraft motor fired on later orbit would raise the 368-pound spacecraft’s altitude to about 600 nautical miles. This 102d launch of a Scout was the ninth success in a row. NASA provided the launch under a June 1962 agreement with DOD to reimburse NASA for the cost of Scout vehicles, Western Test Range (WTR) launch services, and mission support, as required. So far, NASA had launched 15 Transit satellites and 3 Transit improvement program satellites, of which 5 were currently operating. The Navy would reimburse NASA about $7.6 million for services and hardware provided for the program ($1,825 million for launch-vehicle hardware; $0,950 million for WTR launch services and mission support; $4,825 million for FY81 support services).

ESA announced that it had “rejected” NASA’s decision to cancel the U.S. spacecraft that would have been part of the joint International Solar-Polar Mission (ISPM). NASA told a meeting of the two organizations in New York that the cancellation resulted from budget cuts imposed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in preparing the Reagan administration’s budget proposal. ESA responded that canceling the satellite without consultation was a unilateral breach of a memorandum of understanding between the agencies and was unacceptable. ESA asked that NASA restore the program to its original level, noting that unilateral actions of this kind would be detrimental to future space cooperation between the United States and Europe. ESA said that, when its science-program committee decided to pursue ISPM in 1979, they chose that mission over a number of purely European missions because of the value ESA put on transatlantic cooperation. Because of NASA’s decision, European scientists from 17 institutions who supplied experiments for the NASA spacecraft would not be able to fly them. The experiments, “in an advanced stage of development” with more than half of the costs committed, ESA said, would be lost with no corresponding scientific return. ESA’s director general immediately asked all of its member states to protest, through their ambassadors in Washington, the decision taken by NASA. Timing was crucial, because Congress would consider the federal budget in March. (ESA Inf 2)
The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) reported that it had signed an agreement with the International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) to provide satellite communications services to ships. INTELSAT would put at the service of INMARSAT three of its satellites to be launched between mid-1981 and mid-1982: two Intelsat Vs over the Indian Ocean, one over the Atlantic. The maritime communications subsystems (MCS), each with a capacity of 30 voice channels plus data, would operate for up to seven years and would bring more than $100 million (U.S.) to INTELSAT. In addition to the MCS, each Intelsat V could carry up to 12,000 simultaneous international telephone calls and two television channels. (INTELSAT Release 81-1-1)
Japan reported that its National Space Development Agency successfully launched the first N-2 vehicle from Tanegashima carrying the 21st Japanese satellite—the engineering test satellite Ets 4 (Kiku 3)—into a transfer orbit with 36,000-kilometer apogee, 230-kilometer perigee, and 10.5-hour period. The 650-kilogram satellite would monitor vehicle performance. Japan would launch seven N-2s between August 1981 and February 1986 to meteorological and communications satellites and aeronautical experiments. Although used for five years, the N-l did not have the power to carry big geostationary spacecraft into orbit. (FBIS, Kyodo in English, Feb 11/81; NASA Dly Actv Rpt, Feb 12/81)
