Third anniversary of launch of 85-lb (Early Bird), world’s first commercial comsat, owned by intelsat and managed by ComSatCorp. Originally designed as experimental-operational satellite with 18-mo life expectancy, comsat launched by NASA into 22,300-mi-altitude synchronous orbit over Atlantic, was still providing service between North America and Europe with 100% reliability. Intelsat I had received and transmitted more than 200 hr of TV and thousands of telephone calls, data and record messages, and other general communications without satellite service outage. TV use of Intelsat I increased from 31 programs consuming 31 hr leased time in 1965 to 160 programs and 125 hr in 1967. Highlights of TV broadcasts included live coverage of Atlantic splashdowns of Gemini spacecraft, sports events, public affairs, and news programs. (ComSatCorp Release 68—16)
Ats IV mission (launched Aug. 10 and reentered Oct. 17) was adjudged a failure by nasa. Satellite had remained in elliptical parking orbit instead of entering planned synchronous orbit when Centaur engines failed to reignite for second burn. Resulting highly elliptical orbit precluded meaningful return of gravity gradient data. Day-night camera operated, but attitude dynamics precluded reception other than smeared unintelligible pictures. Electrical operation of ion engines, microwave multiple access, and microwave wide band was verified. Boom camera returned good photos, including some of earth. (NASA Proj Off)
India could be first developing country to orbit her own artificial satellite, according to recommendations of five-man mission of UNESCO. Satellite would be first of “distribution” communications design, more powerful than current point-to-point satellites such as Early Bird I and requiring less complex ground facilities. Operating under long-term plan to end in 1981, India would build 56 ground stations which would bring TV to 25% of population. Network of 160 stations could reach 80% of India’s population. Mission recommended India produce 50,000 home TV receivers by 1970—1971 and enter into bilateral agreement with major space power to purchase satellite and launching services. (NYT, 1/28/68)
Univ. of Wisconsin meteorologist Verner E. Suomi said weather satellite research could reduce critical hours needed to identify tornado-producing cloud systems and warn public of threat. Photos from Ats III had shown it was possible to observe rapid expansion at top of tornado-producing clouds, while radar and ground observation tended to show only their “stems.” With adequate facilities, Suomi saw possibility of satellite tornado forecasts presented directly to the public via television.

Soviet scientists reported that automatic docking of Cosmos CCXII and CCXIII April 15 had occurred only 47 min after pursuit vessel was launched. Cosmos CCXII (launched April 14) was orbiting earth at 225.3-km (140-mi) altitude and 17,500 mph when Cosmos CCXIII entered orbit three miles from it. According to Tass, satellites repeatedly changed their orbits, reoriented, maneuvered in space, and conducted various scientific experiments during four days in orbit. Soviet scientists had reportedly developed three launch systems for spacecraft intended for automatic docking in orbit: (1) simultaneous side-by-side launch with docking maneuvers beginning immediately after spacecraft separated from launch vehicles; (2) separate launches from same or different sites with second spacecraft launched as close as possible to first spacecraft in orbit as it passed over launch site [method used for April 15 docking] ; and (3) separate launches of spacecraft into same plane, but with distances between them great enough to require several orbital corrections and maneuvers to close gap.

President Johnson, in letter transmitting to Congress Fifth Annual Report on Communications Satellite Act of 1962, said: “[Report] reflects . . . steady progress toward the ultimate goal of providing mankind with new capabilities for worldwide communication. In the brief span of five years, satellite technology has grown dynamically. The possibilities envisioned in 1962 have been greatly exceeded.” Communications, he said, must provide “ ‘network for knowledge’ so that all peoples can share the scientific, educational, and cultural advances of this planet. . . . “Failure to reach these goals can only contribute to apathy, ignorance, poverty and despair in a very large part of the world. Success in our telecommunications policies can be a critical link in our search for the understanding and tolerance from which peace springs. Communication by satellite is a tool—one of the most promising which mankind has had thus far—to attain this end.” (Text; AP, W Star, 4/3/68, A7; PD, 4/8/68, 637)

Strong arguments in favor of Europe’s making comsats “focal point” of space activity were presented in Spaceflight by spacewriter Arthur C. Clarke, former chairman of British Interplanetary Society. “Reliable domestic radio services are not available over most of the world. Long distance services are of poor quality . . . [and] by 1970, there will be 130 million vhf sets in the world, many of which could pick up direct radio broadcasts from satellites.” U.K., he said, “certainly cannot do everything in space. But what we should not tolerate is the apparently invincible ignorance of those who think that nothing in space is worth doing. . . . Our space achievements will be our greatest legacy to the future. Indeed they will create that future. They will make it possible to have a future.” (Clarke, SF, 3/68, 78-84)
