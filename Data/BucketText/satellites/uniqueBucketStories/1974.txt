The congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy issued the panel report Transportation of Radioactive Material by Passenger Aircraft. The panel recommended that the transport index (the level of radiation in millirem per hour one meter from the surface of packages of radioactive material) be reduced from 10 to 1 and that the maximum permissible radiation at the package surface be lowered by one fourth to one half. Total maximum permissible quantities of curies of radionuclides per package should be at least 10 times lower. Improved packaging, installation of high-level radiation monitors in baggage compartments, and Federal monitoring of packages in transit from supplier to loading were also recommended.

NASA reactivated the main telemetry system on Explorer 46 Meteoroid Technology Satellite (launched 13 Aug. 1972), to gain additional data on the impact flux of small meteoroids. The telemetry system had been shut down 22 Aug. 1972 after the spacecraft battery had overheated, and a solar-powered backup had since transmitted only primary experiment data. Data received before shutdown had indicated that sensors flown on previous missions had overestimated the micrometeoroid population, but variation in the impact flux necessitated additional data. Data transmission would continue through February 1975. (nasa Release 74-321; NASA oast pio, interview, 3 Sept 75)
Indonesia would build a domestic communications satellite system including two satellites and 50 earth stations, the Indonesian Post and Telecommunications Directorate General announced to the press. Each satellite could serve as backup for the other and would have 12 transponders. Each transponder would be able to serve 12 telephone lines or 1 color TV channel. The press later reported that Malaysia and the Philippines were planning to join the Indonesian system. The satellites would be put into orbits that would allow point-to-point telephohe connections within each country and among the three countries. Construction of the system was expected to cost $90 million and take two years. (Jakarta Domestic Service and Hong Kong AFP, FBIS-Indonesia, 18 April 74, Nl-2)
NASA adjudged the mission of Skynet IIA communications satellite, launched 18 Jan. for the United Kingdom, unsuccessful. NASA’s primary objective of launching the comsat into orbit for transfer into a synchronous equatorial orbit permitting the spacecraft to accomplish its operational mission had not been achieved. Skynet 11A had been placed in an extremely eccentric orbit when the Thor-Delta launch vehicle’s 2nd-stage attitude control system failed; preliminary analysis had isolated the problem to a failure in the regulator board of the DC-to-DC converter in the 2nd-stage electronics package, (nasa mor, 4 Sept 74)
The U.S.S.R. launched Meteor 20 meteorological satellite from Plesetsk into orbit with an 896-km apogee, 841-km perigee, 102.3-min period, and 81.2° inclination.

McDonnell Douglas Corp. had been awarded a $13-million contract by Alyeska Pipeline Service Go. to produce 100 000 heat pipes for the trans-Alaska pipeline, the Seattle Journal of Commerce and Northwest Construction Record reported. The heat pipes, called cryo-anchor soil stabilizers, were developed by McDonnell Douglas for thermal control of Skylab Orbital Workshop (launched 15 May 1973) and unmanned satellites. They would prevent thawing of permafrost around the pipe supports of elevated portions of the 1285-km pipeline by removing heat from the ground and transmitting it to an above-ground radiator, where it would be dispersed into the atmosphere.

Gerald M. Truszynski, NASA Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition, testified on the proposed Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss) in FY 1975 authorization hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology: tdrss essentially would be two tracking network stations in synchronous orbit to support all low-earth-orbit satellites, giving real-time control and data with a significant increase in reliability. The system would provide close to six times the coverage given by ground networks because supported satellites would be visible to the orbital stations during 85% of the orbits rather than the 15% from ground stations. Close to continuous visibility would also provide greater flexibility in programming satellite use and would simplify operations. Number of ground tracking stations could be reduced from the 1974 total of 18, plus one ship and two aircraft, to 8 by 1981. (Transcript)

The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization marked its 10th anniversary. Membership, originally at 14, had grown to 86 countries, which j ointly owned the four Intelsat IV satellites and three spare Intelsat III satellites in the global communications system. The system provided more than 5000 international telephone circuits plus telegraph, telex, data, and TV services; charges had progressively dropped from the initial $32 000 per year for a half circuit to $9000. The permanent intelsat Organization had come into being 12 Feb 1973, replacing the interim Consortium that had operated since 20 Aug. 1964. (intelsat Release 74-2)
Ninety-three research teams in the U.S. and foreign countries had been selected for Earth Resources Technology Satellite follow-on investigations, NASA announced. The studies, selected from 669 proposals, included work in agriculture, forestry, environment, interpretive techniques, land use, marine resources, meteorology, mineral resources, oil, civil works, hazards, and water resources. The investigators would use data from Erts 1, launched 23 July 1972, and Erts-B, scheduled for early 1975 launch. NASA would fund the domestic studies at a cost of nearly $5.9 million.

The Federal Communications Commission authorized Western Union Telegraph Co. to launch its second domestic communications satellite. Western Union had requested that Westar-B be assigned a 119° west longitude position [see 2 May], a position the fcc reserved for systems authorized to serve Alaska and Hawaii. However, the fcc took into account petitions filed by Western Union’s competitors, also requesting the location, and assigned the satellite a temporary station at 90° west longitude. The satellite was to be moved to 91° within 30 days after NASA’s Ats 6 was moved from 94°. If Western Union was later authorized to serve Alaska and Hawaii, the FCC could authorize a move to a more appropriate location. (FCC Memorandum Opinion,- Order and Authorization, FCC 74^-584)
NASA announced it had awarded RCA Astro Electronics Div. a fixed-price $15 282 143 NASA contract, with an additional incentive amount of $692 638 for performance in orbit, to provide two operational meteorological spacecraft—Improved Tiros Operational Satellite H and I—and parts for itos-J. The work, to be performed in Hightstown, N.J., would extend through 15 Feb. 1977. The satellites would support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Operational Meteorological Satellite System through 1978. The noncompetitive procurement was a follow-on to an existing contract. (NASA Release 74-218)

Ats 6 Applications Technology Satellite, launched 30 May, transmitted the first instructional TV course broadcast directly by satellite. The course, on career education for elementary school children, originated at the Univ. of Kentucky and traveled by land wires to NASA’s Rosman, N.C., antenna for transmittal to the satellite. The spacecraft rebroadcast the program to more than 300 graduate education students throughout eight Appalachian states. Signals came through strongly in all the receiving areas. Students would receive university credit for successful completion of the course, which included taped lessons, programmed instruction, laboratory sessions, and live seminars. Seminars would use Ats 3, launched 5 Nov. 1967. The course was part of the Dept, of Health, Education, and Welfare’s Health Education Telecommunications (het) experiment to determine the effectiveness of satellite-transmitted educational TV.

The Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences held hearings on S. 3542, a bill introduced 29 May to authorize $41 700 000 for NASA to launch a seventh Applications Technology Satellite. Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah) said experimenters using Ats 6, launched 30 May, had urged another launch because more than the planned one year of operation over the U.S. was needed to complete experiments. Two satellites in orbit at the same time would “greatly improve the experimental information necessary for further decisions on the use of advanced communications satellites.” Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said that ats satellites held “the promise of improved health care at reduced costs” for people in remote regions of the U.S. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified that Ats 6 was in excellent condition and had a life expectancy of three additional years over the U.S. following its return from the planned year of operation over India. In addition, use of the U.S.-Canada Communications Technology Satellite scheduled for a mid-December launch could provide experimenters additional experiment time and continuity. Dr. Fletcher expressed NASA opposition to the bill, saying it would cost $4 million more than the bill provided, to cover the cost of the Titan IIIC launch vehicle. To avoid further costs, a decision to launch another spacecraft would have to be made by September, when the NASA and industry ATS team were to be disbanded. A seventh ats satellite could be considered a potential operational vehicle and the user community might consider bearing the costs. (Transcript)
Satellite observations had been used by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists to map the fading—or “recovery phase”—of the mammoth, layered ring of hot charged particles that encircled the earth during magnetic storms and temporarily canceled the earth’s magnetic field, noaa announced. Explorer 45, launched 15 Nov. 1971 into an elliptical orbit with a good view of the ring current, had measured the distribution of protons before, during, and after a major magnetic storm 17 Dec. 1971. The noaa study found that interactions of hot and cold plasmas in the ring changed the pitch angle of the protons in relation to the magnetic lines of force, permitting some to escape. By mapping distributions of proton pitch angles, researchers could predict what would happen during the recovery phase of a magnetic storm, (noaa Release 74-86)

Detection of a “plasma mantle” by the European Space Research Organization’s Heos 2 Highly Eccentric Orbit Satellite (launched by NASA 31 Jan 1972) was announced by West German space scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Munich. Scientists had become aware of the new belt of electrically charged particles circling the earth while assessing data collected by a specially developed “plasma ana-lysator” in the satellite. The belt of particles emitted from the sun and trapped in the earth’s magnetic field was said to be between 10 060 and 20100 km thick. (B Sun, 24 Oct 74, A3; A & A 1972)
U.S. officials were increasingly concerned by strong pressure from developing countries, backed by the U.S.S.R., to restrict the use of satellites to broadcast TV programs from one country directly to the home sets of another, the Washington Post reported. Old cultures were afraid of being “irremediably debased by the hard sell’ techniques so commercially lucrative in the ‘advanced’ societies.” As the world’s technological giant, the U.S. was the most suspect and the trend among the developing countries was “to tie up . . . the use of satellites by the ‘space-faring’ nations . . . before they gain too great a head start.” (Welles, W Post, 16 March 74, A18)

Ats 6 Applications Technology Satellite (launched 30 May) and Sms 1 Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (launched 17 May) had caused substantial interference for radio telescopes in the U.S., Canada, and Great Britain, the Washington Post reported. Stars in the southwest sky with radio frequencies near those of the satellites could not be studied. Dr. Frank Kerr, spokesman for the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Radio Frequencies, described failed communications between NASA and radio astronomers. The astronomers had learned that Ats 6 would interfere with study of the sun, pulsars, and quasars only when it was too late to change the satellite’s transmitter and that Sms 1 would overlap radio telescope signals only after the satellite had begun sending back weather pictures 17 May.

Stratospheric contamination from supersonic aircraft engines such as those fitted to the Anglo-French Concorde and the Soviet Tu-144 might lower the earth’s mean temperatures, with a catastrophic effect on agriculture, and increase the incidence of skin cancer from overexposure to ultraviolet radiation, according to a Dept, of Transportation study cited by the Washington Post. In a telephone interview with the Post Dr. Alan Grobecker, manager of dot’s climatic impact assessment program, confirmed the existence of the study, which was based on data collected by satellites, balloons, and instrumented aircraft. He emphasized that the pollution by the emission of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide would have a worldwide impact because of the capacity of the stratosphere to retain the pollutants for nearly a year. A separate Agricultural Research Service study showed that stratospheric contamination could cut temperate climate crops by 60%. The DOT paper would be considered by committees of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering at a special meeting in July. (Wilson, WPost, 14 April 74, A8)
NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications Leonard Jaffe—U.S. Representative to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space Working Group and Task Force on Remote Sensing— reviewed U.S. environmental and earth resources programs before the Working Group and Task Force. The U.S. had designed tape recorders and studies on Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched 23 July 1972) for foreign use of the data, but the “extent and vigor of foreign interest was perhaps greater than we expected.” Brazil and Canada had built ground stations to receive data directly and, by agreement with the U.S., were disseminating data. Italy also would establish a ground station, and nine other countries had expressed interest. Erts 1 performance had shown that data collection with a spatial resolution of 100 m was economical and adequate for a wide range of significant applications. Although total discontinuance of photographic imagery was not planned, the speed, reliability, and flexibility found in computer analysis indicated that future systems would increasingly use automated methods. The mapping accuracy of the satellite’s instruments was adequate for 1:1 000 000 and even 1:250 000 scale when system errors were removed by computer processing. Processing and disseminating data was a key factor in the cost of an earth observation program. No one data-processing and dissemination facility would ever be able to meet the needs of the world efficiently. Estimates put the cost of an additional system similar to the Erts 1 data-collection system—aside from spacecraft costs—at $11 million for the facility and $9.9 million for five years of data processing. A minimal system with only multispectral scanner and real-time observations would cost $2.5 million for the facility and $3.6 million for five years of data processing. (Text; NASA OA, interview)
Communications Satellite Corp. reported a net income of $21 013 000, or $2.10 a share, for the first six months of 1974—up from $15 223 000, or $1.52 a share, for the same period in 1973. Operating revenues for the period were $63 322 000, up from $55 902 000 in 1973. The increased revenues had resulted from a gain in the number of half-circuits leased by ComSatCorp to its carrier customers for overseas satellite communications. (ComSatCorp Release 74-41)
Explorer 46 Meteoroid Technolpgy Satellite, launched 13 Aug. 1972, was officially adjudged a success. The primary objective of measuring meteoroid penetration rates on a bumper-protected target in the near-earth environment was achieved despite the failure of half of the bumper panels to deploy fully. Because of die anomaly, the spacecraft batteries had overheated and data collection from the main telemetry system had been discontinued; since 22 Aug. 1972, data from the primary experiment had been transmitted through the backup system, which operated on solar cells only. Flight data showed that the bumper concept was six times more effective than a single-wall structure, twice the anticipated effectiveness. Because the secondary experiments had been powered only by the spacecraft batteries, no data were received from these experiments after 22 Aug. 1972. One secondary experiment—to measure impact flux of small mass meteoroids—had recorded 1850 penetrations, however, enough to show conclusively that the microphone meteoroid sensors flown on early Explorer and Discoverer satellites had greatly overestimated the population of small meteoroids.

The U.S.S.R. was believed to have orbited between 8 and 10 radar-carrying satellites in the last four years that could monitor surface shin traffic around the globe, Thomas O’Toole said in a Washington Post article. Intelligence sources believed the satellites were still experimental and part of an effort to monitor submerged Polaris submarines. One radar satellite, Cosmos 626, launched 27 Dec. 1973 into an orbit 264-km high, separated into two parts 11 Feb. One part moved to a higher 382-km orbit and was thought to be the power supply for the orbital radar, using polonium 210, a “hot” source of radioactive heat that could generate as much as 2000 kw of electricity by thermoelectricity. (W Post, 26 April 74, Al) 27 April-5 May: Two full-scale models of the Spacelab manned orbital laboratory, to be developed by the European Space Research Organization for use with the shuttle, were shown to the international press and public for the first time at the 1974 German Aerospace Show in Hanover, West Germany. Visitors were able to see interior as well as the exterior equipment of the pallet and pressurized laboratory. A 1:50 scale model of the-space shuttle was also on display, (esro Release, 22 April 74)
The U.S.S.R. launched Meteor 16 meteorological satellite from Plesetsk to collect information for weather forecasts. Orbital parameters were 892-km apogee, 830-km perigee, 102.2-min period, and 81.2° inclination. The satellite carried instruments to photograph the clouds and snow cover on day and night sides of the globe and to collect data on the heat reflected by the earth and its atmosphere, (gsfc Wkly SSR, 28 Feb-6 March 74; Tass. fbis-Sov, 6 March 74, Ul; SF, Sept 74, 355)
The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization announced it had contracted with Hughes Aircraft Co. for three Intelsat IVA satellites in addition to three ordered in 1973. The amendment to the 1973 contract totaled more than $40 million, including launch support services but not possible performance incentive payments. The -first of the additional satellites, with twice the communications capability of the Intelsat IV series, was to be delivered in 1977. (intelsat Release 74-67)
The U.S.S.R. had requested permission, during the February visit of a Soviet science delegation to Australia, to establish a jointly controlled satellite tracking station in Australia, the New York Times reported. The U.S. had expressed concern that the Soviet Union might use the scientific station to monitor U.S. messages to bases Li Australia and reportedly believed the proposal would be rejected.

The Federal Plan for Meteorological Services and Supporting Research— Fiscal Year 1975, published for presentation to Congress, called for programs totaling $576.7 million, an increase of $5.7 million over 1974. Published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and including proposed activities of all Federal agencies with meteorological programs, the 1975 plan proposed an improved noaa severe weather warning system; use of new technology for more efficient observation, recording, analysis, and warning in the Dept, of Defense and other agencies; and expanded Federal Aviation Administration weather services to aviation. NASA proposed increases for research with the Nimbus satellite series, (noaa Release 74-128)
The European Space Research Organization announced the award of three contracts totaling nearly $66 million for design and development of two spacecraft and one satellite communications payload: $25.2 million to GEC-Marconi (United Kingdom) as the prime contractor for the marots maritime communications satellite payload to be launched in 1977; $20.76 million plus launch and postlaunch support to Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Ltd. (U.K.) as prime contractor for the MESH consortium, for the marots spacecraft platform and satellite integration and support; and $19.56 million to Dornier-System GMBh (Germany) as prime contractor for the star consortium, for the isee-b International Sun-Earth Explorer, to be launched with isee-a in 1977 in a cooperative nasa-esro program. Norway, the first nonmember country to participate in an ESRO project, had agreed to contribute 1.5% to the marots development budget of about $97 million and to share in fixed common costs, (esro Release, 3 Dec 74; Av Wk, 2 Dec 74,38)
President Nixon transmitted World Weather Program, Plan for Fiscal Year 1975 to Congress. The plan outlined 1975 U.S. participation in the program seeking to give man “the understanding, tools and techniques necessary to cope with his atmosphere.” Goals were to extend the time, range, and scope of weather predictions; assess the impact of atmospheric pollution on environment; study the feasibility and consequences of weather modification; and encourage international cooperation in meeting meteorological needs. He said the U.S. would soon begin continuous viewing of storms over much of the earth’s surface with two geostationary satellites and that five more such satellites would he made operational in cooperation with other nations.

Federal Aviation Administrator Alexander P. Butterfield signed in London a Memorandum of Understanding for a joint program to test, evaluate, and demonstrate the Aeronautical Satellite (Aerosat) system, for improved communications and air traffic services over the North Atlantic. Other participants included Canada and European Space Research Organization members Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Great Britain, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The space segment would include two synchronous-orbit satellites to be launched in late 1977 or early 1978 and would be jointly owned by ESRO, Canada, and a U.S. private sector coowner to be named later. FAA would lease use of the satellites from the U.S. coowner, (faa Release 74-70)
Communications Satellite Corp. filed proposed rates with the Federal Communications Commission for a new medium-speed digital-data satellite service called digisat, to provide digital data channels between the U.S. mainland and Hawaii. The proposed monthly rate to international common carriers would be $2700 for 2.4 kilobits per sec, $3000 for 4.8 kbps, and $3900 for 9.6 kbps. Expansion to European points was expected later in the year. (ComSatCorp Release 74-21; ComSatCorp pao, interview)
Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite, launched 23 July 1972, stopped transmitting useful stored global data, following continued degradation of its tape recorder. After two years of operation, Erts 1 was providing only real-time imagery, making world-wide coverage no longer possible. Good continuous U.S. coverage was being maintained by ground stations in Canada, Alaska, California, Maryland, and Brazil. The satellite * had been designed for one-year operational lifetime, (gsfc proj off, interview, 30 July 75; Av Wk, 19 Aug 74, 17; NASA Release 73-62; NASA, ERTS-A Fact Sheet, 12 July 72)
A spherical object from Cosmos 654 satellite was reported recovered in Ohio. Cosmos 654, launched 17 May 1974, had been reported by the press as a Soviet ocean surveillance satellite. The debris was believed to have been a portion of the staging system used to move the craft from its initial low, near-circular orbit into a higher, longer life orbit with a 1022-km apogee and 915-km perigee. There the nuclear systems required for ocean surveillance radar equipment and sensors could decay naturally before the orbit decayed years in the future. (.SBD, 3 Oct 74,164-5; gsfc SSR, 31 Oct 74) 3, 4, 9 October: The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications held hearings on H.R. 14978 and H.R. 15781, bills to establish offices in the Dept, of the Interior and NASA to operate an Earth Resources Survey System. Hugh T. Loweth, Deputy Associate Director for Energy and Science of the Office of Management and Budget, testified that more experimentation was needed before the Earth Resources Technology Satellite program entered the operational phase, but witnesses from industry and other agencies of Government recommended accelerating the program immediately. Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, NASA Associate Administrator, and Charles A. Mathews, Associate Administrator for Applications, opposed adoption of the bills, stressing NASA’s desire for “an evolutionary approach” that minimized an artifical distinction between experimental and operational satellites and concentrated instead on immediate dissemination of data and simultaneous improvement of the system [see 6, 8, 9 Aug. and 18 Sept.].

The U.S.S.R. was continuing plans to build an earth station in the Ukraine to operate with the International Telecommunications Satellite Organiza-ion’s comsat system. The project—the second planned Soviet Intelsat link—had been unofficially reported by Russians in discussions with U.S. Government and private representatives over the past few months. (The first station, near Moscow, had been initiated to provide a bilateral communications capability for the U.S.—U.S.S.R. Hot Line, via a Molniya and an Intelsat satellite). U.S.S.R. participation in the Intelsat system as a commercial user would fill in a major link in the U.S. goal of a single global comsat system, as stated in the 1962 Communications Satellite Act, Aviation Week & Space Technology commented.

Westinghouse Corp. subsidiary TCom 'Inc. (for Tethered Communications) was testing the aerostat, an inexpensive alternative to earthorbiting satellites, Time reported. Developed from signal-relay balloons used for reaching isolated U.S. outposts in Vietnam, the aerostat was a helium-filled balloon anchored at altitudes of 3000-5000 m. In the Bahamas, an aerostat at a 3500-m altitude picked up signals from Miami 180 km away, trebling the range of Florida stations. With its 1800 kg of electronic equipment, the aerostat could receive and broadcast up to 4 TV channels, 2 command radio stations, and data from 5000 to 10 000 microwave circuits. (Time, 23 Sept 74)
Available geosynchronous orbit “parking space” for communications satellites to serve the continental U.S. was fast approaching saturation with authorized and applied-for comsat systems operating in the 4- to 6-gigacycle band, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. This saturation was expected to provide added incentive for second-generation domestic comsats to shift to the new 11- to 14-gc band, permitting spacecraft to orbit closer to the existing comsats.

The U.S.S.R. launched Molniya II-9 communications satellite from Plesetsk into orbit with a 40 700-km apogee, 599-km perigee, 12-hr 17.0-min period, and 62.9° inclination. The satellite would help provide a system of long-range telephone and telegraph radio communications in the U.S.S.R. and would transmit Soviet central TV programs to the Orbita network, (gsfc Wkly SSR, 25 April-1 May 74; Tass, fbis-Sov, 30 April 74; U1; SF, Sept. 74,395)
The channeled scabland of eastern Washington had been formed 20 000 yrs ago by the greatest flood known to have occurred, the New York Times quoted U.S. Geological Survey as reporting. From ground scars and photographs from Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched 23 July 1972), scientists had traced the flood for 885 km. An ice dam blocking drainage of western Montana into Idaho had collapsed, pouring 2000 cubic km of water down the valley of the Spokane River. Scars visible in satellite photographs were formed by erosion of surface soil and underlying basalt. As water drained, gravel ridges 6 to 9 m high and 3 km long had been formed. The largest channel was the Grand Coulee, 80 km long and 270 m deep. (Sullivan, NYT, 17 Sept. 74; uses pio, interview, 12 June 75)
Iran signed an agreement to build a ground station to receive data directly from nasa’s experimental earth resources satellites. Under the Memorandum of Understanding signed with NASA in Tehran, the new site would join six others already in the system—three in the U.S. and" one each in Canada, Brazil, and Italy, Iran would bear the full cost of building the facility and would make its data and tapes available to NASA in return for free access to the first two Earth Resources Technology Satellites. Thereafter, NASA had the option to establish a cost-sharing arrangement, (nasa Release 74-289)
Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah) introduced an amendment to S. 2350 that would continue experimentation with earth resources remote-sensing satellite systems through 1 Jan. 1980 unless a permanent system was established before that date. The amendment was a substitute for S. 2350, the earth resources survey bill to develop an operational erts system and to establish an Office of Earth Resources Survey Systems within NASA and an Earth Resources Observation Administration within the Dept, of the Interior [see 18 Sept.]. Other provisions of the amendment would require the President, through nasa and doi, to ensure continuity of satellite data during the experimental period and furnish Congress with any necessary budget amendments.

Evidence of a possible second black hole, from observations by x-ray astronomy satellite TJhuru (Explorer 42, launched 12 Dec. 1970) between January 1971 and February 1973, was reported by Center for Astrophysics astronomers in the Astrophysical Journal. Black holes were believed to be superdense collapsed stars with gravity so great that even light could not escape. Uhuru had detected radiation from the x-ray source Circinus X-l with characteristics similar to those detected in 1972 by TJhuru and in 1973 by Oao 3 for the suspected black hole Cygnus X-l. Varying periods of x-ray intensity had indicated that Circinus X-l was possibly binary; the x-ray energy spectrum had showed changes from 2 to 20 kev. No optical counterpart for the x-ray-source had been found. Black holes might be an answer to two basic problems in cosmology, Walter S. Sullivan had written in the New York Times Magazine 14 July. All visible material accounted for only 2% of the matter necessary to prevent the universe from flying apart in a continuing expansion; some scientists thought black holes might well make up the deficit. Also, black holes might provide the “glue,” the necessary gravity, to keep clusters of galaxies from flying apart. Not all scientists were convinced of the existence of black holes, but the holes’ strange effects—such as the slowing of time, the tight curvature of space, and the influence of gravity on light—had been anticipated by Einstein’s theory of relativity. One major dilemma was what happened within a black hole. Some scientists had proposed that a star drawn into a black hole by its gravity might emerge in some other time and place as a quasar and that quasars—■ exceptionally bright objects of relatively small volume and high density—might be “white holes” into which energy was pouring from somewhere else, perhaps even another universe.

The U.S.S.R. proposed that the United Nations establish a center for collection and distribution of data from earth-orbiting satellites. The proposal was made in response to a U.S. offer to supply the U.N. with a master copy of all information obtained from Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite, launched 23 July 1972, if a facility would be available to process the data. The Soviet proposal suggested a single international center, under the U.N. or another international organization and financed by voluntary contributions. The U.S.S.R. previously had been unwilling to bring in any international authority. U.S. space experts later suggested the new proposal was a significant development in closer Soviet-U.S. cooperation, reached by the scientific exchanges between the two countries. Another view was that the U.S.S.R. was trying to head off a possibility that the U.S. might turn over its expertise to private enterprise. Brazil had earlier proposed a treaty that would obligate space powers to obtain consent of governments for remote-sensing activities over their countries and for release of the data obtained.

Electronics Div. to develop, produce, and operate the Phase I control and user system segments of the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System [see During August], (dod Release 793-74) 22 October-12 November: The U.S.S.R. launched Cosmos 690 biological satellite from Plesetsk into an orbit with 366-km apogee, 216-km perigee, 90.3-min period, and 68.8° inclination. The satellite carried white laboratory rats, steppe tortoises, insects, and fungi in a test of the combined effects of weightlessness and radiation. A cesium-137 gamma radiation source within the spacecraft provided an average radiation dose of 32 rads per hr on command from the earth. Beginning on the 10th day of the flight, the rats were exposed to doses of gamma-quantums ranging between 200 and 1000 rads over 24 hrs. After return to the earth 12 Nov., the rats were found to be more pathological and less active than after corresponding control experiments. The change in the hemopoietic and lymphoid organs was more sharply pronounced than in the Cosmos 605 experiments (31 Oct.—22 Nov. 1973). While experiment results were processed, research was continuing on methods of antiradiation protection by deflecting particles with an electric field. Czechoslovak and Romanian specialists cooperated with the U.S.S.R. on the Cosmos 690 project as part of the Intercosmos program, (gsfc Wkly SSR, 17-23, Oct 74; Pravda, FBIS-Sov, 3 Jan 75, Ul-^4)

Plans for an Arab communications satellite network were presented by Arab League engineer Salah ’Amir during a meeting with League Secretary General Mahmud Riyad in Cairo. The plans—prepared -with the assistance of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (unesco) and the International Communications Union—had been completed in 1972. The network would establish radio, TV, and news agency links among the Arab states to transmit standard educational, cultural, and development programs. Fifty ground stations would be established with the costs of each—between $500 000 and $1 000 000—defrayed by the country of its location. The costs of the satellites and launch facilities would be paid by member states. (Cairo MENA, FBis-Inter-Arab, 17 Jan 74, A6)

Development of a new generation of communications satellites—such as Westar 1 (launched 13 April), Ats 6 (Applications Technology Satellite launched 30 May), and three others scheduled for launch in 1974 and 1975—would bring the fifth revolution in human communications, Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in a New York Times article. The satellites would provide a “quantum jump in the capacity of Americans to talk to and see one another.” The most immediate effect would be to reduce cost of long-distance communications and increase number of words and pictures'exchanged. Overseas calls originating in the U.S. had jumped from about 10 million a year in 1965 to 60 million in 1973. Dr. Jastrow predicted that by 1982 the U.S. would originate 1 billion overseas calls and a call halfway around the world would cost the same as a call next door. Other consequences might be a world language and the ability of people to live where they pleased. With an inexpensive satellite-transmitted dial-up conversation by color TV, people would not have to live in cities; “every house can be transformed into an office, a theater, or a classroom by pressing a few buttons.” Long-term effects might knit mankind into a global society, enriched by freer exchange of ideas and reduced fear between nations. A unified global society, however, would be an organism of great collective power in which the individual would be restricted to one role. “The prospect is not pleasant. But the transformation . . . will take place slowly . . . and most of our descendants will be conditioned to accept their more restricted options.” (NYT, 9 June 74, 4:6)
ats-f Applications Technology Satellite, scheduled for a 30 May launch, was “a very unusual nasa satellite,” Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, said at an ats-f press briefing in Washington, D.C. It was an advanced satellite with a huge transmitting antenna and “the first step towards ... a satellite that can broadcast TV directly to your homes.” Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Caspar W. Weinberger said that hew would be using the satellite for career counseling, teacher training, education of medical students, health eduoation, and transmission of medical records to remote areas of Alaska, Appalachia, and the Rocky Mountains. The practical civilian application “justifies fully a continuance of . . . both the space program in its inner-space aspects as well as . . . bringing it down to earth and using it in our own daily lives.” President Henry Loomis of the Corp. for Public Broadcasting said that, for the “first time, we will have current TV programming available in Alaska.” TV videotapes now were sent to Alaska by mail and reaching the most remote 10% of the people cost as much as reaching the remaining 90%. ats-f would greatly reduce that cost. NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications Leonard Jaffe said that the ats-f was “a major step forward” in the amount of radio frequency power that a satellite could generate to earth and focus very precisely on a small area. Because of this capability, very small, simple receiving stations would be adequate. (Transcript)
President Nixon established the Committee on Energy. The Cabinet-level advisory body would coordinate development of energy policy within the Executive Branch. (PD, 17 June 74,607-8) 15 June-23 September: The Global Atmospheric Research Program’s Atlantic Tropical Experiment (gate) was conducted over a 51-million-sq-km area of tropical land and sea to collect data on the behavior of the tropical atmosphere and its ultimate effects on global weather. Sponsored by the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization, more than 4000 scientists, technicians, and support personnel from 72 countries—including the U.S., Brazil, France, East and West Germany, Mexico, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, and U.S.S.R.—used 38 ships, 65 instrumented buoys, 13 aircraft, 6 kinds of satellites, and nearly 1000 land stations to observe and record phenomena from the top of the atmosphere to 1500 m below the sea surface. Objectives of gate were to extend the time range and scope of weather predictions, develop means to assess pollution, determine feasibility of large-scale weather modification, and establish new bonds of international cooperation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration coordinated U.S. participation, which included NASA, Dept, of Defense, Dept, of State, Dept, of Transportation, National Academy of Sciences, National Science Foundation, and National Center for Atmospheric Research, as well as the private sector of the scientific community. Instrumented aircraft, including NASA’s Convair 990, flew at altitudes between 90 and 9150 m to probe the cores of tropical cloud clusters and investigate the intertropical convergence zone, ocean waves and surface temperatures, radiation, tropical disturbances and dust layers moving off the African continent, and day-night weather changes in the coastal areas. Ships from 10 countries, including NASA’s Vanguard tracking ship and eight other U.S. vessels, investigated tropical cumulus cloud clusters, uppermost layers of ocean affected by local atmospheric conditions, and the broad systems of ocean currents near the equator. Satellites-—including Sms 1, Ats 3, Noaa 2 and 3, Nimbus 5, and dmsp Defense Meteorological Satellites from the U.S. and polar orbiting Meteor-class satellites from the U.S.S.R.—furnished day and night information on cloudtop heights and temperatures, cloud liquid-water content, wind speed and direction, temperature and moisture in the atmosphere, and sea surface temperatures. Land stations provided surface and upper-air data; instrumented buoys collected data from the sea surface to 10-m altitude. Each nation contributing vehicles would process and validate the collected data. By March 1976 all data would be sent to two World Data Centers, operated by the U.S. and U.S.S.R., where they would become available to scientists, (noaa, gate News Press Kit, 9 May 74; gate Release NI 74-45; FBis-Poland, 25 June 74, G6; noaa Release 74-1541
