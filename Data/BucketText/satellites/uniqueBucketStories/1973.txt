A New York Times editorial criticized “boom-and-bust science”: Scholarship and research were “caught between the penny-pinching of economy-minded conservatives and the hostility of those, at the other end of the spectrum, who equate science expenditures with support of the military. A more realistic view of national needs should make it evident that none of the nation’s and the world’s critical problems—from environmental issues to the urgent need for food, energy and transportation—will be solved without the innovative contributions of trained minds. The continued boom-and-bust cycles in support of education and research constitute a costly waste of the nation’s human resources. Perhaps the President’s recent presentation of the National Medal of Science to eleven top scientists—the first such awards since 1970—represents a signal of Administration desire for a sounder approach.” (NYT, 10/15/73, 36) October 16:	The U.S.S.R. launched two Cosmos satellites from Plesetsk.

A Science article commented on President Nixon’s Oct. 3 speech announcing National Medal of Science winners [see Oct. 3] : “How serious Nixon is about achieving the objectives cited in his remarks will be indicated by future budgetary activities. In recent months, however, there has been plenty of evidence that the Administration wants to make changes not only in the substance of science policy, but also in the way that policy is made. The most obvious indicator was the shift of the science advisory apparatus from the White House to nsf. Underlying the change seems to have been not just a dissatisfaction with the science advisory machinery, but also with the basic relationship between the scientific community and its federal patrons which has prevailed since World War II.” It would be wise for the scientific community to examine carefully the new terms which President Nixon seems to he offering. “However, the recent invitation from the White House did, figuratively, seem to be directed to scientists and engineers in general.” (Walsh, Science, 10/ 26/73, 365-8) Octobkr 27: The U.S.S.R. launched Cosmos 603 from Plesetsk into orbit with a 356-km (221.2-mi) apogee, 204-km (126.8-mi) perigee, 90.0min period, and 72.8° inclination.

NASA held a Hq. press conference with French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau on the joint NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration project in which Cousteau and his oceanographic research ship Calypso had participated [see Feb. 8, 15, and 21]. Cousteau had gathered data on ocean temperature, color, and breeding areas which would be compared with data from satellites in the NASA Applications Satellite program and from noaa’s Environmental Satellite Service. Cousteau said the opportunity to contribute to the project had been “very thrilling, because we believe that one of the most urgent tasks is to monitor the earth’s resources and the ocean resources, and also to control—later on—directly from outer space, the degree of pollution of the surface of the ocean.” During the expedition in Antarctic waters Cousteau had received satellite photos from Nimbus 2 satellite (launched by NASA May 15, 1966), Essa 8 (launched Dec. 15, 1968), and Noaa 2 (launched Oct. 15, 1972) to help him navigate the dangerous Drake passage between Antarctica and Ushuaia, Argentina. They were “the most valuable tool we had to plan our trip.” (Transcript)

Newspaper editorials and columnists commented on the Aug. 17 Dept, of Defense announcement that the U.S.S.R. had flight-tested multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles (mirvs) . New York Times: “Since the Soviet mirv tests have been anticipated for so long, there is no justification for a panic reaction from Washington, or a further fattening of the strategic weapons budget. The latest Soviet tests increase the urgency of concluding a MIRV limitation accord, but they also add to the already overwhelming mutuality of interest in achieving it.” (NYT, 8/20/73, 20) Washington Post: “The potential of the mirv technology coupled with the Soviets’ giant missiles—especially given their present numerical advantage in certain key categories—could be menacing indeed.” It was “precisely this Soviet potential which argues for a serious, effective and non-wasteful approach to the circumstances in which we now find ourselves. This ... is no time to proceed with turkeys and lemons, or to box ourselves into investments in weapons systems whose cost is exceeded only by their irrelevance to such danger as we would be confronting a few years hence if the ‘worst case’ regarding Soviet armament came true.” Before the issue of phasing out the present U.S. arsenal in favor of less vulnerable sea- and air-based forces, “one reaches the more immediate question of how this Soviet development can or cannot be tamed within the context of the current phase of the arms negotiations.” (W Post, 8/20/73, 24) August 21:	The Air Force launched an unidentified satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base by a Titan IIIB-Agena booster into orbit with a 39 132-km (24 315.5-mi) apogee, 392-km (242.6-mi) perigee, 11-hr 41min period, and 63.3° inclination.
