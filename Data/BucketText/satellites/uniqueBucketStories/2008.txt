Engineers completed thermal vacuum testing of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) at the Northrop Grumman facility in Redondo Beach, California. LCROSS was a NASA mission to search for water ice in a permanently shadowed crater in the Moon’s polar region. The satellite successfully completed the tests, which simulated the temperature variations in space, from highs of 230°F (110°C) to lows of -40°F (-40°C). After completing all final checkout tests, Northrop Grumman planned to deliver LCROSS to NASA’s KSC for integration on the Atlas V, as a secondary payload to Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The LCROSS mission was part of the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program at NASA’s MSFC.(NASA, “Moon-Bound NASA Spacecraft Passes Major Preflight Tests,” news release 08-156, 24 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08156_LCROSS.html (accessed 21 April 2011).)
For the first time since its 27 April 2008 launch, ESA’s satellite GIOVE-B transmitted navigation signals. GIOVE-B, a test craft for the Galileo global navigation system, successfully transmitted the common GPS-Galileo signal in a specific optimized waveform known as multiplexed binary offset carrier (MBOC), thus demonstrating that the GPS and Galileo systems could operate compatibly. Compared to GPS, Galileo would provide deeper penetration for indoor navigation and a greater level of accuracy in environments where multipath and interference occur. ESA officials would analyze the quality of the signal to ensure that it conformed to the system’s design specification, that it did not interfere with services on adjacent frequency bands, and that the environment did not affect the signal.(ESA, “GIOVE-B Transmitting Its First Signals,” press release no. 26-2008, 7 May 2008, http://www.esa.int/ esaCP/Pr_26_2008_p_EN.html (accessed 29 March 2011).)
Israel’s state-owned Israel Space Industries (ISI) successfully launched a military reconnaissance satellite aboard an Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle from the Sriharikota test site in India at 03:45 (UT). The 300-kilogram (661-pound) satellite TechSAT, or Polaris, carried a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) developed by ISI’s subsidiary Elta Systems. The SAR had the capability of producing 1-meter (3-foot) resolution images at all times of day and in all weather conditions. News media reported that Israel’s Ministry of Defense, which had already assigned to the satellite a strategic-intelligence-gathering mission, would be the principal user of this technology—the first of its kind for Israel. The launch, repeatedly delayed because of weather and technical problems, marked the first satellite collaboration between Israel and India.(Barbara Opall-Rome, “India Launches Israeli Radar Satellite,” Space.com, 25 February 2008, http://www.space. com/news/080122-sn-israel-india.html (accessed 14 December 2010); Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 651.)
NASA’s Swift satellite spotted the most distant GRB that scientists had ever seen. Swift’s Burst Alert Telescope first sighted the exploding star at 1:47 a.m. (EDT); less than 2 minutes later, Swift’s X-ray Telescope began to observe the GRB. A team of astronomers from around the globe examined light from the fading GRB in seven wavelengths, to determine its distance from Earth. The explosion’s shift toward the less energetic red end of the electromagnetic spectrum— a phenomenon known as a redshift—indicated its remoteness. Named GRB 080913, the explosion had occurred 12.8 billion light-years away from Earth, in the constellation Eridanus. Occurring when the universe was less than 825 million years old, GRB 080913 was 70 million light-years farther away from Earth than the most distant previously known GRB.(NASA, “NASA’s Swift Catches Farthest-Ever Gamma-Ray Burst,” news release 08-239, 19 September 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/sep/HQ_08239_Swift_GRB_discovery.html (26 July 2011).)
ESA’s first ATV, known as Jules Verne, undocked from the ISS at 23:29 (CEST). The ATV, which had launched on 9 March 2008, had carried 6 tonnes (6.6 tons or 13,227.74 pounds) of supplies to the ISS, including clothing, food, oxygen, propellants, water, and other dry cargo. The US$1.9 billion craft had remained docked at the ISS for six months, serving as an extra room. While there, the ATV had boosted the ISS’s orbit four times to counter residual atmospheric drag. Additionally, on 27 August 2008, the ATV had performed an avoidance maneuver to take the ISS out of the path of debris from an old satellite. Before Jules Verne’s departure, ISS crew members had loaded it with 2.5 tonnes (2,500 kilograms or 2.76 tons) of trash. ESA had scheduled the ATV to enter a controlled destructive reentry of Earth’s atmosphere on 29 September 2008.(ESA, “ESA’s ATV Successfully Undocks from International Space Station,” news release 36-2008, 5 September 2008, http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_36_2008_p_EN.html (accessed 26 July 2011); ESA, “Successful Re-entry Marks Bright Future for ATV,” news release 41-2008, 29 September 2008, http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_41_2008_ p_EN.html (accessed 26 July 2011); Tariq Malik, “European Cargo Ship Departs Space Station,” Space.com, 6 September 2008, http://www.space.com/5810-european-cargo-ship-departs-space-station.html (accessed 29 July 2011).)
Researchers led by Vassilis Angelopoulos of the University of California−Los Angeles (UCLA), announced in the journal Science that their team had demonstrated that magnetic reconnection in Earth’s magnetotail produces substorms that cause the aurora borealis to brighten and to move. Magnetic reconnection is a common phenomenon in which stretched magnetic lines suddenly snap into a new shape. Angelopoulos’s team made the discovery using data from a 26 February 2008 substorm. NASA’s Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms mission (THERMIS) had collected the data. THERMIS tracked the beginnings of substorms, using five satellites and 20 ground observatories to make synchronized observations every four days. Scientists were interested in studying the origins of substorms because they often occur in conjunction with strong space storms, which can interfere with human activities, such as radio communication and GPS signals.(NASA, “NASA Satellites Discover What Powers Northern Lights,” news release 08-185, 24 July 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jul/HQ_08185_THEMIS.html (accessed 21 July 2011); see also Vassilis Angelopoulos et al., “Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset,” Science 321, no. 5891 (15 August 2008): 931−935.)
Virgin Galactic unveiled a unique new aircraft, the mothership for its commercial spacecraft, a very large composite plane named WhiteKnightTwo. Virgin Galactic would use WhiteKnightTwo to lift Virgin Galactic’s spacecraft, SpaceShipTwo, to approximately 48,000 feet (14,630.40 meters) above Earth. From that distance, the spacecraft could carry tourists to an altitude of 65 miles (104.61 kilometers). Virgin Galactic stated that WhiteKnightTwo also had other possible uses. Virgin Galactic could use the mothership to transport passengers from one destination on Earth to another, travelling at near orbital speeds. Furthermore, since the craft could provide short bursts of microgravity conditions, people would be able to use it to train for space travel. In addition, Virgin Galactic could use WhiteKnightTwo to launch satellites and uncrewed aerial vehicles and to carry large payloads.(Leonard David, “Virgin Galactic Unveils Space Liner Mothership,” Space.com, 28 July 2008, http://www.space. com/5665-virgin-galactic-unveils-space-liner-mothership.html (accessed 26 May 2011).)
