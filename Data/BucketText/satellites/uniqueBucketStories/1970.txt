Although Communist China officially had entered space age with April 24 launch of satellite, milch of the country’s industrial machinery was “product of an earlier age,” New York Times said. Workers at Shanghai factories had said they “used the equipment of the twenties to turn out products of the seventies.” While Communist China’s space success reflected “application of a more advanced technology,” even this was said to have been achieved “because the Chinese people adhered to the ‘principle of independence and selfreliance.’ ” (NYT, 5/3/70,18)

Science editorial commented on comsats: The communications satellites have a variety of applications. . . . One application that will probably be implemented fairly soon is aeronautical and ship communication. Radio works well on line of sight but is undependable at distances greater than 300 miles [483 km]. Many ships have been lost while radio operators were trying in vain to communicate their peril. Midocean aeronautical navigation represents another growing need which could also be filled. Satellite enthusiasts point to other potential uses. One of these is Picturephone, which now requires about 100 telephone circuits for a single two-way conversation. High-capacity; low-cost satellite circuits would help to make feasible large-scale use of this device. Perhaps more distant but of great consequence would be exploitation of future inexpensive communications for use in educational television. Constructive applications of satellites are now a reality, and extension of technological potentials will have profound and global consequences.” (Science, 11/20/70)

U.K. had 3, France 5, Canada 3, West Germany 1, Australia 1, and esro 3. (SD Union, 2/8/70) During January: Space/Aeronautics reviewed status of aerospace and aeronautical projects at commencement of 1970s. Commercial transport industry was “microcosm of the capitalistic system. The health of any constituent, sst or airbus or Stol, is on trial in a harshly profit-motivated atmosphere that says. .. ‘shape up or ship out.’ Nowhere is this test more evident than in the troubled, hesitant posture of the U.S. SST program.” With retrenchment to fixed-wing design “and a continual dropback in the urgency level of our SST effort,” sst’s competitive advantages were “being dissipated by an inexorable calendar.” Apollo 11 lunar landing had alleviated Congressional opposition to further expensive long-term space commitments. “Suddenly, it was practical to think of going ahead with an expanded lunar exploration program.” Space science and applications program had been marking time, “with most programs stretched out to match the diminished funding made smaller still by the nasty bite of inflation.” But “light is beginning to show at the end of the long, dark tunnel of fiscal retrenchment.” Success of satellite infrared spectrometer (sirs), “welcome and long overdue test of ATS-3” for coast-to-coast relay of TV programs, and climb in “Comsat’s ’69 operating profiles” above Si-million mark had led space science program steadily to shift “its dollar focus away from the earth.” Civil systems activity by aerospace community was only token. “Yet 1969 may prove to have been a landmark year for the industry’s relations with this strange and often self-contradictory market. New initiatives by the federal government indicate a growing awareness in Washington of what aerospace may be able to contribute to the solution of complex civil problems.” (S/A, 1/70, 27-69, 81-132)

With advent of SST, information on meteorological conditions at higher levels of stratosphere would be needed for routine civil-aviation operations, Frederick G. Finger and Raymond M. Mclnturff of ESSA’s Weather Bureau said in Science. Forecast system would be extended from 12-km (7.5-mi) to 20-km (12.4-mi) altitudes or higher. Forecasting techniques to support SST might be facilitated by exploiting similarities between stratosphere and troposphere weather. Much remained to be done on phenomenon forecasting. Wind effects should be smaller for SST than for subsonic aircraft but wind forecasts might be necessary during winter, when variations were high enough to effect economics of operation. Knowledge of temperature fields and of ozone distribution could prove valuable. Possible solar cosmic radiation hazards would be minimized by ground-based forecasting system and onboard detection equipment but sonic boom problem at ground level might be less tractable. Amplification and attenuation of boom by meteorological conditions could be predicted. World Weather Watch of U.N. and ESSA’s satellites and spacecraft with ability to depict continuous three-dimensional temperature distribution and wind pressure over entire globe would play major role in providing SST meteorological information, as would SST itself.

aiaa Earth Resources Conference to consider technical, economic, and political aspects of global satellite system was held in Annapolis, Md. In keynote address Under Secretary of State U. Alexis Johnson said surveying earth’s resources from space could change face of international relations. He warned nations must organize international survey program to avoid serious diplomatic problems when system became operational in few years. “We should start now to consider with other countries how best to capitalize and coordinate earth resource surveying systems as they come to serve the interests of many countries. People value what they pay for and they will not contribute to a U.S. program.” Problem of how to handle data gathered from country not participating or not wanting information known was major problem. Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.), Chairman of Subcommittee on NASA Oversight of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said NASA’s projected new program costs were “unrealistically low.” He predicted, “There will be pressure on Congress to reduce the space budget still further unless the future orientation of the program is based less on space spectaculars and more on the production of tangible benefits.” ERC and mit research teams reported that camera and sensor systems for survey satellites had shown in aircraft and balloon tests along northeastern coast of U S. that air and water pollution could be monitored effectively and traced to sources by satellites.

Their new ‘swing-wing’ bomber prototype could become operational, and their submarine-launched ballistic missile force is expanding rapidly.” U.S. continued to reduce bomber strength of Strategic Air Command. “We have phased out the B-58s, and severely cut back the FB-llls. At end FY-71, we will have fewer B-52s and 66 FB-llls. We hope to offset the reduced strength by increasing the capability of our bombers with the Short Range Attack Missile (sram) and the Subsonic Cruise Armed Decoy (scad) and providing for increased prelaunch survivability through satellite basing and improved warning.” In last five years, “we have cut our active interceptor strength by two-thirds and our radars by one-half. The Soviets during this period have maintained their Long Range Aviation forces at about 200 heavy bombers and over 700 medium bombers and tankers. ...” (Testimony) In testimony before Senate Armed Services Committee, L/G Otto J.	Glasser (usaf) said development of short-range attack missile (sram) would be completed in September, usaf would run 12 tests of advanced ballistic reentry system (abres), push studies of new midcourse surveillance system to warn of attacking missiles, operate four large-payload flight tests using Atlas E and F boosters in abres program, and continue advanced development “to apply new technology to the mid-course tracking and discrimination problem.” Satellite system looked “promising” but usaf was investigating alternate sensor/platform combinations “to assure that no promising concept is overlooked.” usaf advanced avionics program was pursuing electronically scanned, phased-array radar antenna for strike aircraft and completion of all-weather close-support weapon-delivery system.

Lord Ritchie-Calder wrote in Foreign Affairs: “Past civilizations are buried in the graveyards of their own mistakes, but as each died of its greed, its carelessness or its effeteness another took its place. That was because such civilizations took their character from a locality or region. Today ours is a global civilization; it is not bounded by the Tigris and the Euphrates nor even the Hellespont and the Indus; it is the whole world. Its planet has shrunk to a neighborhood round which a man-made satellite can patrol sixteen times a day, riding the gravitational fences of Man’s family estate. It is a community so interdependent that our mistakes are exaggerated on a world scale. ... Modern Man can outboast the Ancients, who in the arrogance of their material achievements built pyramids as the gravestones of their civilizations. We can blast our pyramids into space to orbit through all eternity round a planet which perished by our neglect.” (Foreign Affairs, 1/70,207-20)

Since the satellite went into its unusual orbit two weeks prior to the [Middle East] cease-fire, it should have been possible to obtain photos of Soviet missile deployment prior to the truce, if that is its intended function. If the U.S. has obtained such photos by satellite, this fact as well as the pictures themselves would be closely guarded. ...

(UPI, WPost, 1/14/70, C6) Nike-Apache launched at dusk was unsuccessful because 2nd stage failed to ignite. Nike-Apache launched at dawn carried sodium experiment that created reddish-orange cloud visible for hundreds of miles along East Coast. Nike-Cajun and four Nike-Apaches carried trimethylaluminum (tma) payloads that formed pale white clouds. Data were obtained by photographing continuously motions of trails from five ground-based camera sites. Similar tests had been conducted Feb. 13-14, 1969. In conjunction with vapor series two Nike-Apaches and one Nike-Cajun were launched at 6:47 am, 12:23 pm, and 12:55 pm EST Jan. 14, carrying acoustic grenade experiments to obtain correlative data on atmosphere between 48- and 121-km (30- and 75-mi) altitudes by detonating grenades and recording their sound arrivals on ground. Areas was launched at 1:27 pm est Jan. 14 to obtain additional meteorological data. (WS Release 70-1) Apogee motor was fired at 8:29 am EST Jan. 16 to place satellite in near-synchronous orbit of 35 900-km (22 300-mi) altitude over Atlantic and antenna was deployed. Full-time commercial service was scheduled to begin Feb. 1, with 955 circuits carrying telephone and telegraph traffic between 17 earth stations in Atlantic region. Satellite could also carry TV traffic at same time and had 1200-circuit capacity. Intelsat-III F-6 was fourth successful launch in Intelsat III series. Last successful mission, Intelsat-III F-4 (May 21-23, 1969), had been followed by Intelsat-III F-5 (July 25, 1969), which failed to reach planned orbit, (gsfc Dir Wkly Rpt; ComSatCorp Releases 701,70-4, 70-6; Proj Off)
