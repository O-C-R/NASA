A European Space Agency (ESA) Ariane 3 launch vehicle was successfully launched from Kourou Launch Center in French Guiana carrying two communications satellite payloads, including a U.S. satellite. The launching had been scheduled for December but was delayed for extra tests after abnormalities were detected in the oxygen and liquid hydrogen thirdstage engine. Twenty minutes after launch, the Ariane 3 released the French Telecom 1C and GTE's Spacenet III Geostar R01 communications satellites for autoboost into geostationary orbit, 22,554 miles above the Equator. The spacenet satellite was expected to begin its boost toward geostationary orbit at 87 degrees west longitude on Wednesday.

NASA and the Department of Commerce awarded the first U.S. Government contract for commercial launch transportation services to a private firm. The two agencies contracted General Dynamics Space Systems Division, San Diego, California, to provide expendable launch vehicle transportation services for the Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). This contract marked the first time a contractor assumed systems performance responsibility for overall program and subcontractor0*management, vehicle design, production, testing and vehicletopayload integration, mission integration, launch services, system effectiveness, overall launch vehicle performance, and mission In a related matter, NASA's Kennedy Space Center recently entered into an agreement with General Dynamics that allowed the company to use NASA Launch Complex 36 and associated facilities for commercial launch operations of the Atlas/Centaur rocket.

An ESA Ariane 3 launch vehicle carrying two U.S. communications satellites was launched from the Korou launch facility in French Guiana. The Ariane 3 was carrying the 1.3ton GSTAR 111 and 1.2ton SBS 5 telecommunications satellites, both designed for television, telephone, and digital data transmission. Upon reaching low Earth orbit, the GSTAR satellite failed to boost itself into its planned 23,000mile geosynchronous orbit.

NASA announced it would testthroughout the montha new deepspace communications system with its Voyager 2 spacecraft, in preparation for the Voyager 2 flyby of Neptune in August 1989. As part of the new system, NASA added the 27 telescopes from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) facility to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's deep space network (DSN). This action more than doubled DSN's ability to capture the Voyager signal, which became extremely faint as it approached the vicinity of Neptune. Under an agreement between NASA and the National Science Foundation, NRAO sponsors, engineers installed new receivers and microwave horns, tuned to the Voyager XBand radio frequency, on all the 82foot dish antennas at the0*VLA. Special signalprocessing and communication equipment was added so that the VLA would be linked by satellite to the DSN's Deep Space Communication's Complex at Goldstone, California.

An advanced Navy navigation satellite, NOVAII, was launched into polar orbit on a NASA Scout launch vehicle from Western Space and Missile Center (WSMC), California. This was the 111th flight of the 73foot long, fourstage, solid propellant Scout launch vehicles. (SSR 1988 052C; NASA Release 8875)
China successfully launched its first experimental weather satellite, the Wind and Cloud No. 1. The satellite was launched by a Long March 4 launch vehicle from the Taiyuan launch facility in northcentral China. (FBISCHI8890, Sep 16/88; SSR 1988 080AB; AP, Sep 7/88; W Post, Sep 8/88)
