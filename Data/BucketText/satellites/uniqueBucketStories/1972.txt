Cosmos satellites’ wide variety of functions were described in Trud by Soviet engineer T. Borisov.. Primary objectives of Cosmos program —which had included almost 500 spacecraft—were “profound and comprehensive scientific investigations of circumterrestrial space” and earth, improvement of space vehicles, and application of experiments “connected with the extensive use of space for national economic and cultural purposes. Very appreciable results have been achieved in . . . the historically short span of 10 years.” Cosmos satellites had studied circumterrestrial plasma and its interconnection with earth’s magnetic field, previously unknown dynamics of processes in upper atmosphere and space, and relationship between sun and earth. “Cosmos-261 and Cosmos-348 explored the plasma ocean. Cosmos-166, which spent a long time patrolling the sun, made a careful survey of the solar disc. Cosmos-92 and Cosmos-149 could be described as modern geophysical laboratories. The astronomers’ automatic laboratory Cosmos-215 had eight telescopes on board to observe hot stars in visible and ultraviolet rays. It also had an X-ray telescope and two photometers to record solar radiation dispersed by the earth’s upper atmosphere.” Series had also contributed to “the further improvement of space technology” and led to creation of first orbital station. “It was only after testing all the complex mechanical, electrical, and radio engineering systems and installations, and after two Cosmos satellite automatic dockings that the way was opened to Soyuz . . . and Salyut. The Cosmos satellites have tested many systems, units and assemblies of lunar and interplanetary automatic apparatuses. . . . the thermo regulating system assemblies, the solar batteries, means of communication, and many scientific instruments for the Luna, Venera, Zond, and Mars apparatuses were created on the basis of or having regard to experience gained in the operation of similar installations in Cosmos satellites.” (fbis-Sov, 3/30/72, LI)

Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial commented on Apollo program: Six lunar landings had marked “historic watershed in the annals of man.” They had been “boldest, most imaginative and technically complex achievements of man” and had “added a dimension to the human spirit that cannot be fully measured for decades.” Among Apollo’s most important benefits were: (1) “Development of new technology faster, and on a far broader front than is generally realized. The spearhead technology spawned ... is not just confined to aerospace but has spilled over into other broader areas such as medicine, communications and education.” (2) “Creation of a cooperative blend of engineering and scientific effort that appears to have begun bridging a divisive gulf and providing a pattern for more fruitful future work.” Apollo 17 “with its first scientist-astronaut crewmember, foreshadows the increasing opportunity for scientists to work in space as Skylab and the space shuttle provide sufficient capacity for non-flightcrew specialists.” (3) “Creation of a management capacity in both government and industry for marshaling vast resources to focus on a specific goal to achieve results within a limited time. Hopefully, these techniques can be applied to other complex problems facing modern society.” (Hotz, Av Wk, 12/11/72, 7) December 12:	Molniya II—4 communications satellite was launched by U.S.S.R. from Plesetsk into orbit with 39 300-km (24 420-mi) apogee, 470-km (292-mi) perigee, 11-hr 45-min period, and 65.3° inclination.

Analysis oif “exceptional” satellite picture of Alaskan topography obtained by image dissector camera system (idcs) aboard Nimbus 4 (launched April 8, 1970) was described by U.S. Geological Survey scientist Ernest H. Lathram in Science. Major structural features had been identified despite relatively low degree of ground resolution of image, which had been exposed at altitude of 1100 km (680 mi). Regional lines not yet recognized in surface mapping had been perceived. Synoptic view provided by image showed orthogonal fractures not heretofore apparent in regional maps of Alaska that might reflect “conjugate set of fractures within the crust which has exerted significant control over the geological history of the state.” Scientists had concluded increased resolution in other images from space platforms, like resolution of 60 to 200 m (200 to 650 ft) planned for Earth Resources Technology Satellite program TV cameras, “will permit the discernment of finer detail and a greater accuracy in identifying and locating geologic features.” (Science, 3/31/72, 1423-7)

Discovery by instruments aboard Uhuru (Explorer 42 Small Astronomy Satellite launched Dec. 12, 1970) of regular pulse rhythm in x-ray pulsar was reported by Washington Post. Pulsar discovered in constellation Hercules by Uhuru in November 1971 pulsed for 9 days; then stopped pulsing for 27 days, in repeated pattern. Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Frank D. Drake had said discovery was “every bit as bewildering” as discovery of pulsar itself. “There is no known reason why a star should disappear and then reappear at such regular and predictable times.” Possibilities advanced by astronomers included one that pulsar was orbiting another pulsar whose radio waves were unobservable by Uhuru and that second pulsar overwhelmed first for 27 out of 36 days. Second possibility was that Hercules pulsar was outermost of two stars circling third star in egg-shaped orbits and that eccentric orbits and eclipsing behavior of second orbiting star kept Hercules pulsar hidden from earth three fourths of time. Third and most likely possibility was that pulsar wobbled off orbiting path around its fellow star so that it cast beam into space, away from earth, for 27 out of 36 days.
