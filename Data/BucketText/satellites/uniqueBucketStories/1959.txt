DISCOVERER VI satellite orbited successfully, but reentry capsule not recovered.
EXPLORER VI, popularly called the �Paddlewhcel Satellite," launched by NASA Thor-Able 3, contained 14 experiments, and a photocell scanner which transmitted a crude picture of the earth�s surface and cloud cover from a distance of 17,000 miles. Placed in highly elliptical orbit (26,000 miles out, 150 miles in), It gave a broad samplo of readings, (See Appendix A.)
