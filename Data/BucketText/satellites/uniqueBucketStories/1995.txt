After the successful launch of a satellite called "Wind," NASA gave the manufacturer, Martin Marietta Astro Space, the go-ahead to build a second satellite called" Polar."  The purpose of both satellites is to measure the forces of solar wind. (Star-Ledger, Jan 6/95)
An international team of scientists have examined data from the Japanese/U.S. X-ray astronomical satellite �ASCA� which may confirm how cosmic rays achieve speeds near the speed of light. Enrico Fermi suggested a theory in 1949 in which charged particles are bounced between turbulent regions inside the shock front of a supernova explosion. Bouncing much like a ping pong ball between a table and a paddle as the paddle is brought closer to the table, a charged particle gains energies up to 100 trillion electron volts. The tell-tale clue to the discovery was the detection of two oppositely-located regions in the rapidly expanding remnant of the Supernova of 1006 AD. The ASCA satellite contains telescopes for simultaneously taking images and spectra of X-rays, allowing astronomers to distinguish between different types of X-ray emission from nearby regions of the same celestial object. ASCA was launched February 20, 1993. (NASA Release 95-208)
U.S. polar orbiting weather satellite programs are being combined to save money. Costs for the combined program will be split between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Defense Department. NASA will be in charge of developing the technology for the new systems. (AP, Aug 23/95)
NASA�s unmanned spacecraft Wind, patrolling interplanetary space 662,000 miles from Earth, detected a �giant magnetic cloud� on October 18. An updated �space weather alert� was issued to commercial satellite operators, electrical utilities and other organizations worldwide. The disturbance was speeding to Earth at over 2.1 million miles per hour. It produced a magnetic storm and auroral displays that persisted for two days. Future disturbances are anticipated as the 11-year sunspot cycle is expected to peak shortly after the year 2000. The Wind spacecraft was launched November 1, 1994.

A satellite payload designed and built by college students was launched onboard a NASA launch vehicle. Shortly after launch the SURFSat-1 was separated from the primary payload and moved into a polar orbit. When the project began in 1987, six Caltech students were chosen to begin the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURFSat). Each summer a new group of undergraduates took over. Through 1994, 61 students have participated. The satellite has two experiments: one tests how Earth�s atmosphere affects the new Ka-band being implemented on NASA�s Deep Space Network, and the other tests ground stations supporting NASA�s new Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry project. The latter will be used to communicate with a Japanese spacecraft that will make radio astronomy studies of quasars and other objects at the edge of the universe.

A Japanese-German attempt to put a space capsule into orbit for five days of experiments failed, sending it tumbling through the atmosphere where it broke up and burned over the Pacific after two or three orbits. The $60 million "Express" satellite was supposed to land in Australia's outback Saturday for retrieval. (H Chron, Jan 17/95; Reuters, Jan 16/95)
Industry analysis by the Virginia firm Teal Group showed that almost 1,000 satellites, mostly for communications, will be launched during the next ten years. Most of these satellites will belong to mobile communications multi-satellite systems such as Motorola's Iridium and Space Systems/Loral's Globalstar. The most common destination for these satellites will be Earth low orbit. (Defense Daily, Jan 10/95)
The HST has discovered ozone on Jupiter�s satellite Ganymede, making it one of the solar system�s rare moons that have atmospheres. Ganymede�s ozone is produced when it passes through charged particles trapped in Jupiter�s powerful magnetic field. (AvWk, Oct 16/95)
Conestoga rockets are expected to be launched from Wallops Island, Virginia. These 52 foot rockets could bring life back to one of the earliest launch sites in the country. The rockets are produced by EER to launch satellites for global communication and high-technology navigation. Today�s launch was postponed due to hydraulic failure in two engines.

The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) mission will be launched in October 1998. This mission was selected earlier in the year as part of an overall restructuring of the Explorer program. Beginning in 1958, the Explorer program provides Earth-orbiting satellites to conduct research in space physics and astrophysics. (NASA Release 95-206; Space News, Nov 27/95)
