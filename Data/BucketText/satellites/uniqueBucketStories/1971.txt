Uhuru (Explorer 42) Small Astronomy Satellite—launched Dec. 12, 1970—was adjudged successful by NASA. Satellite had completed full systematic scanning of galactic plane and substantially complete scan (95%) of celestial sphere. Experiment instrumentation was functioning in outstanding manner, exceeding many design objectives. Spacecraft control section performance—except for tape recorder and slight decrease in telemetry modulation, which had not affected data quality—was excellent. Acquired scientific data had touched on every aspect of observational x-ray astronomy and significant unexpected phenomena had been observed. Discovery of three new x-ray pulsars—■ Cygnus X—1, Centaurus X—3, and Lupus X-l—revealed class of pulsating x-ray source that differed in many respects from previously known x-ray pulsar in Crab Nebula, (nasa Proj Off)
Bell Aerospace Rendezvous articles described GSFC-devised positionlocation and aircraft communications experiment (place) to test feasibility of transoceanic air traffic control system that would use earth-orbit satellites. Experiment was designed following earlier mission analyses by erc. “Scheduled for 1973, the year-long experiment will determine the technical and operational feasibility of using communications satellites to give ground control centers precise and uninterrupted readings and control of air traffic over the North Atlantic 24 hours a day.” Experiment would employ two satellites—Ats 5 launched Aug. 12, 1969) and ats-f (to be launched in 1973)—and three ground stations, place would be able automatically to pinpoint to within one mile [1.6 km] actual positions of up to 250 aircraft, update information once a minute, and predict locations between updates. Operational place system could reduce flight-corridor widths to 48 km (30 mi) and aircraft spacings from 15- to 5-min intervals, permitting same corridors to accommodate 12 times as much traffic without affecting flight safety. In bad weather, place could simultaneously reroute every aircraft within flight corridor. Although place was geared only to North Atlantic air traffic, “it is the forerunner of what could become a worldwide satellite air traffic and surface control network.” (Rendezvous, Summer/Fall, 71, 9—11; Aerospace Technology, 2/26/68, 33)

New York Times commented on orbiting of second Communist Chinese satellite: It had provided “impressive evidence of the advance of Communist China in war-related technology. It hardly needs underlining that a rocket capable of orbiting a sputnik could also deliver a hydrogen bomb to a distant target on earlji.” It was evident that “Mao Tse-tung has been trying to insulate a small group of scientists and their activity in weapons development from the general turmoil of the cultural revolution as well as from the inadequate supply of practically everything in normal Chinese economic life. That effort has apparently been successful.” (NYT, 3/11/71, 38)
France’s Eole (CAS-1) Cooperative Applications Satellite was launched by NASA from Wallops Station at 2:39 pm edt. Four-stage Scout boosted spacecraft into orbit with 906.1-km (563.6-mi) apogee, 677.8-km (421.2-mi) perigee, 100.7-min period, and 50.2° inclination. Primary NASA objectives were to place spacecraft into appropriate earth orbit to obtain meteorological data from balloons and to analyze meteorological data acquired from constant-density surface balloons for study of characteristics and movements of air masses. Secondary NASA objective was to acquire technology of satellite range and range-rate system for locating free-moving balloons. The 85-kg (187-lb) satellite—developed by France’s Centre Nationale d’fitudes Spatiales (cnes) and named for mythical God of Winds— would collect information on wind, temperatures, and pressures from up to 500 instrumented balloons flying at 11 900-m (39 000-ft) altitude in Southern Hemisphere. Balloons, to be launched by cnes and Argentine personnel from three sites in Argentina, could be interrogated by Eole day and night, individually, in sequence, or in programmed group of up to 64 at a time. Eole’s meteorological objectives were to study circulation of atmosphere from tracks of balloons, provide basis for standard reference system of pressure and temperature to be used in World Weather Program, and learn more about local winds. Mission would prove feasibility of modified Doppler system plus range measurements to determine accurately location of each balloon and prove out superpressure balloon design and lightweight, frangible balloon-borne electronics. Eole was launched under May 27, 1966, Memorandum of Understanding between cnes and NASA with no exchange of funds, cnes designed, built, and tested spacecraft and balloons and would manage balloon launchings, spacecraft tracking, data acquisition, and data processing. NASA provided launch vehicle, prelaunch support, launch operations, and initial tracking and data acquisition. Data would be analyzed simultaneously by cnes and by Eole Data Interpretation Group comprising representatives of NASA, cnes, ncar, NOAA, and ucla. (nasa Proj Off; NASA; Release 71-144)
Discovery of cloud of hydrogen gas 80 billion km (50 billion mi) long and traveling through space at 210 000 km per hr (130 000 mph) in different direction and at 60° angle from solar system was reported in Washington Post. In interview Dr. Gary Thomas, head of Univ. of Colorado team of astronomers that discovered cloud, had said it would take cloud at least 50 yrs to pass by solar system and could take forever. “For all we know . . . it’s been there forever.” Cloud was discovered first by Ogo 5 in September 1969 and later confirmed by same satellite three times.

Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering, testified on dod space activities during authorization hearings before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: dod space funding program for FY 1972 called for $1552.6 million, slightly under the $1553.1 million of FY 1971. “The design and fabrication of a new set of satellites intended to replace the interim Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs) will be completed in 1971. These satellites, to be launched next month, have significantly higher power and greater bandwidth than their predecessors, and each is equipped with a versatile set of antennas capable of serving fixed and transportable users dispersed over large areas of the earth. Among these are steerable antennas which can be oriented to satisfy contingency needs in changing global situations. To exploit the potential of this new system, we will need better surface terminal equipment. Accordingly, we intend to continue the intensive development of new reliable terminals and modulation and antijamming equipment.” In FY 1972, dod expected “to start developing a satellite communications system that operates in the military ultra-high-frequency (uhf ) hand and is tailored to the characteristics of the mobile users. When deployed, this system should allow us to retire much of our hf radio equipment.” Use of navigational satellites “has the potential of attaining a continuous, highly accurate worldwide position-fixing system. That system could support many ground, sea, airborne and space applications.” In FY 1972, dod planned “to undertake system definition and design studies of the next-generation Defense Navigation Satellite System (dnss).” Under Doppler Geodetic Satellite Program coordinated by Defense Intelligence Agency, geodetic Doppler receivers would observe USN navigation and other Doppler-equipped satellites. Program would provide worldwide geodetic data. dod proposed “to continue a small effort in FY 1972 to develop propulsion technology for high-energy orbit-to-orbit stages that will be compatible with the shuttle system, with a view to future space maneuvering missions projected for the late 1970’s and early 1980’s.” (Transcript)
U.S.S.R. had again tested “hunter” satellites, designed to locate and destroy other satellites, George C. Wilson reported in the Washington Post. Cosmos 394 (launched Feb. 9) had entered circular orbit and had been intercepted by Cosmos 397 (launched Feb. 25), he said. Satellites’ inclination suggested launches were from Plesetsk rather than Tyuratum [ Baykonur] and “probably means that the Soviet Union considers its satellite inspection system in the operational rather than experimental category.” (WPost, 3/9/71, A3)

Communist China’s technological progress was described by Bernard T. Feld in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: “The inescapable conclusion that the Chinese had mastered the difficult technologies of U—235 separation and hydrogen bomb production was somehow sublimated in the conviction that they would be much slower in mastering intercontinental ballistic missile technology. This conviction, advanced in the teeth of evidence—after all, the Chinese invented the rocket— was reinforced by reports of widespread technological disruption in the Cultural Revolution, Their two successful launchings of space satellites, the last one weighing around 480 pounds [218 kg], in March 1971, should have disabused even the most skeptical or prejudiced. In any case, there are a sufficient number of recent eyewitness accounts by Westerners of Chinese scientific achievements in various fields to dispell any notions of Chinese technical inferiority,” {Bull of Atomic Scientists, 9/71)

Study of telemetry from unsuccessful Europa 2 European launch vehicle that failed on launch Nov. 5 had shown vehicle buckled at lst-end stage junction 2 min 30 sec after liftoff during excessive pitch-over maneuver, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. Vehicle’s structural limits were exceeded; 2nd stage nozzle pierced liquid oxygen tank atop 1st stage, causing it to explode; 2nd stage separated in tumbling flight and exploded 10 sec later; and 3rd stage, 4th stage perigee motor, and payload fell into South Atlantic about 490 km (305 mi) downrange. Failure had been attributed to loss of inertial-guidance-system signals between 1 min 45 sec and 1 min 47 sec after launch. Engines on 1st stage had driven Europa 2 below programmed trajectory because corrective signals had not been sent to stage’s autopilot. Exact cause of inertial-guidance-system breakdown had not been determined.

Challenge of educational satellite telecommunications was discussed in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists by Delbert E. Smith: While advances in comsat technology promised to revolutionize global communication, “it is not certain that educational uses of such a satellite system will develop concomitantly. They may, in fact, be lost in the speed with which our society utilizes the more spectacular and commercially viable facets of the medium.” Educational Satellite Center at Univ. of Wisconsin had been established to work toward “fuller understanding of the social, cultural, political and legal consequences of the inevitable massive transformations in global communication patterns which are imminent.” Objectives of EDSAT Center were: to provide focus for multidisciplinary research and training in educational and social applications and impact of comsats, to develop working models for application of satellite telecommunications systems to educational and social problems, to develop and maintain satellite transmission and reception capability for integration of hardware and software research, and to disseminate information on educational and social applications of space telecommunications.

Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences continued hearings on nasa FY 1972 authorization. Roy P. Jackson, nasa Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, testified that LeRC quiet engine program was proceeding on schedule: “Tests of full-scale fans for the engine have revealed much new information von the interrelationships among noise, aerodynamic performance, and structural integrity. The complete experimental engine will be operated in about 6 months. Results . . . indicate that we may expect to better the original noise abatement goals. Program results are given to industry on a continuing basis. . . . We can expect some of our improvements to be adopted by industry in new engine designs before completion of our program.” nasa—aec Space Nuclear Systems Office Manager Milton Klein said: “Reactor power sources will be required to provide power in amounts greater than a few kilowatts for many of the missions of the future. For unmanned military satellites, radiation hardening—mandatory for certain military missions—and low recurring costs for multiple missions are important advantages of small reactor systems. For unmanned NASA earth orbit missions, reactors become cost effective above a few kilowatts, a power range needed for such applications missions as communications satellites. In manned missions . . . overriding advantage of reactor systems is their ability to accommodate unforeseen large increases in power demand.” Advanced reactor systems “are needed for electric propulsion systems capable of high energy missions ... to the far planets.” Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition Gerald M. Truszynski reported that satellite network included “ten electronic ground stations . . . operated by NASA, which are supplemented by an optical tracking network operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. The electronic stations provide a worldwide system which . . . tracks each satellite, . . . determines the status of onboard systems, . . . commands the satellite’s functions, and . . . acquires stored or real-time data from the satellite. The optical stations, which include laser capabilities at selected sites, provide specialized services in precision orbital tracking.” (Transcript)

Workshop was sponsored by nasa, Dept, of Agriculture, noaa, U.S. Geological Survey, usn Naval Oceanographic Office, aid, and Dept, of State. Ambassador George H. W. Bush, U.S. Representative to U.N., in welcoming address called space technology a global tool and said, “for a global tool to be used productively and efficiently, there must be a climate of international cooperation.” Workshop and U.N. could “provide policy makers and program managers in developing countries with the basic information to enable them to consider seriously how this new technology may help them meet their needs.” Dr. William T. Pecora, Under Secretary of the Interior, said in keynote address that earth-surveying satellites were “must” for world’s welfare. “Whether or not our great population can avoid intolerable social problems of a crowded world and maintain the hoped-for living standards is a matter of conjecture, but our ability to survive will depend in large part on critical assessment of all the earth’s resources.” Leonard Jaffe, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications, described nasa Earth Resources Aircraft Program (erap) : “Instead of waiting for data acquired from spacecraft, users are presently obtaining multispectral data of Earth phenomena from sensors carried by NASA aircraft ... to evaluate the sensors and to develop a solid foundation for observational and interpretive techniques for earth-resources space missions.” erap included RB-57F, P-3A, and C-130B aircraft. “We shall shortly add two more high altitude (U-2) aircraft.” Lockheed C-130B was flying optical and infrared laboratory with 24-channel multispectral scanner to provide information on signatures used to separate, classify, and identify specific earth resources. “This is an expansion of the 12-channel scanner of the University of Michigan C-^47 aircraft which we also use for the same purposes. The P—3A or Electra is our radio-wave instrument development laboratory.” Radio antennas on underside of aircraft were used heavily for oceanographic and hydrological studies. Since remotely sensed data had to be verified with actual ground data, “complementary ground efforts are necessary during the research phase of the program.” In spacecraft program to begin in 1972, “erts satellites will be placed into a 920-kilometer [570-mi], sun-synchronous (near polar) orbit. This will permit the satellite, with its narrow-angle sensors, to observe the same spot on Earth once every 18 days. It also ensures that observations are made with a nearly constant solar-illumination angle required for developing identification signatures. The altitude permits narrow-angle sensors to be used to obtain virtually undistorted images.” (nasa Release 71—74; GE Challenge, Summer 1971; Transcript)

Big Bird also included infrared heat-sensing equipment that allowed it to “see” through ice and snow to locate Soviet underground weapons. Klass had reported heaviest concentration of long-range Soviet missiles in Siberia and behind Ural mountains in Central Asia. (Time, 8/30/71, 26)
Representatives of nine European Space Conference member countries and five Atlantic and Pacific area countries met at FAA Hq. to explore possibilities for unified preoperational program in aeronautical satellites over Pacific and Atlantic Ocean areas. At final meeting, group decided to establish International Collaboration Ad Hoc Group to make specific proposals for unified program to Second Aeronautical Satellite Meeting in Madrid Aug. 3. (faa Releases 71—91, 71—93)
Ats 3 applications technology satellite, which had temporarily stopped transmitting weather pictures because of locked-on antenna [see Aug. 24], was operating again, nasa announced. Although spacecraft was still not working properly, it was transmitting cloud-cover pictures of Western Hemisphere during the five per cent of the time when camera was aimed at earth, (nasa Release 71—171)
U.S.S.R. launched Cosmos 455 from Plesetsk into orbit with 487-km (302.6-mi) apogee, 271-km (168.4-mi) perigee, 92.1-min period, and 70.9° inclination. Satellite reentered April 9, 1972. (gsfc SSR, 11/30/71; 4/30/72; sbd, 11/23/71, 111)
Two usaf comsats launched Nov. 2 from etr by Titan IIIC as part of improved series of Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs) satellites were in operational modes as programmed. After insertion into synchronous orbit over Pacific, first satellite had failed to turn on its telemetry system. Second satellite had turned on telemetry, but telemetry was sporadic. Subsequent efforts of ground controllers were successful and both satellites responded to ground commands. (SBD, 11/11/71, 55)
U.S.-Canadian agreement on joint program to use satellites and aircraft in surveys of natural environment was announced by NASA. Objective was to advance remote sensing technology for monitoring air, water, land, forest, and crop conditions and for mapping ice movements, ocean currents, and geologic, hydrologic, vegetation, and soil phenomena. Canadian Dept, of Energy, Mines and Resources (emr) would receive data at ground station in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and data-handling facility at Ottawa directly from nasa’s erts satellites, scheduled for 1972 and 1973 launch. Canadian and U.S. test areas would be designated. Ground and aircraft data acquired and exchanged would be available to international community as soon as practicable. No funds would be exchanged between EMR and NASA. (nasa Release 71-95)
U.S.S.R. launched two satellites from Plesetsk. Cosmos 470 entered orbit with 257-km (159.7-mi) apogee, 190-km (118.1-mi) perigee, 88.9-min period, and 65.4° inclination. It reentered Jan. 6, 1972. Oreol, joint Soviet-French experiment in Arcade program to study upper atmosphere at high latitudes and determine nature of polar lights, entered orbit with 2477-km (1539.2-mi) apogee, 400-km (248.6mi) perigee, 114,6-min period, and 73.9° inclination. Satellite carried instruments to study spectrum of protrons and electrons, to measure integral intensity of protons, and to determine ionic composition of atmosphere, (gsfc SSR, 12/31/71; 1/31/72; Tass, fbis-Sov-71-249, 12/28/71, LI; Sov Aero, 1/17/72, 15)
