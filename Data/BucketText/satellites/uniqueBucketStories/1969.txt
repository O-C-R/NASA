NASA’s Explorer XXXVIII (launched July 4, 1968), orbiting at 3,640-mi altitude, had discovered earth, like Jupiter, sporadically emitted low-frequency radio signals, Radio Astronomy Explorer project scientist Dr. Robert G. Stone told 1969 spring meeting of U.S. National Committee of International Union of Radio Science in Washington, D.C. “In the radio frequency range below 10 megahertz, the Earth looks very much like Jupiter. This suggests that the same processes that account for the Jovian radio noise may also be active in the Earth’s magnetosphere.” Signals from both planets appeared sharply beamed or directed in narrow cone, were quite intense and increased in intensity rapidly when observed toward lower frequencies, and were impulsive, occurring in rapid but sporadic bursts. Explorer XXXVlll also had revealed sun was more active source of radio outbursts in lower frequencies than expected, providing unique means of studying sun’s outer atmosphere to 36-million-mi distance of Mercury orbit. “Such information,” Stone said, “could shed further light on mystery of Sun’s part in cause of low frequency radio storms on the Earth.” Explorer XXXVIIFs four 750-ft-long antennas had provided most comprehensive and detailed measurements of cosmic radio noise at low frequencies yet available. Information was providing first low-frequency maps of radio emissions in Milky Way galaxy, showing that most radio emissions originated in plane or disc of Milky Way. Satellite had remained stable since orbit despite repeated movement and had continued to operate successfully. (NASA Release 69—57; AP, B Sun, 4/22/69, A6; O’Toole, W Post, 4/22/69, Al)

NAS published NRC Div. of Engineering’s Useful Applications of Earth-Oriented Satellites, Report of the Central Review Committee of NRC Summer Study on Space Applications, prepared for NASA. Study concluded that space applications program was “too small by a factor of two or three.” Benefits from program were expected to be large, “certainly larger than the costs of achieving them.” However, “an extensive, coherent, and selective program” would be required to achieve benefits. Committee recommended that NASA give greater emphasis to earth-satellite programs with promise of beneficial applications, commit additional funds to expanded R&D and prototype operations for certain applications, and commit $200 million to $300 million yearly to space applications program. Manned space programs should be justified in their own right, not in terms of space applications; near-term benefits for mankind would be achieved “more effectively and economically with automated devices and vehicles.” Noting that in meteorology and communications “satellites have already entered solidly into the area of economic usefulness,” report recommended that NASA grant high priority to development of multichannel distribution system for public and private network TV; multichannel system for educational broadcasts in developing countries and for special interest groups such as physicians, lawyers, and educators; and North Atlantic satellite navigation system for traffic control of transoceanic aircraft and ships. Satellite earth-sensing was dependent on R&D in sensor signatures—form of information provided by instruments. Report recommended immediate pilot program for providing information in familiar and immediately usable form, exploration into use of side-looking radar, and start of 10- to 12-yr development plan for more sophisticated sensors.

Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, told House Committee on Science and Astronautics in testimony on NASA FY 1970 budget request: “We are moving toward a number of important milestones in the Space Applications Program, the most important of which is the Earth resources survey area, where we are requesting funds for the design and construction of a research satellite, Earth Resources Technology Satellite (erts). We think the ERTS Program will be a very valuable addition to mankind’s tools for handling the natural and cultural resources of the world.” FY 1970 ossa program required $559 million in new obligational authority. Although increased over FY 1969, program was well below FY 1963 through 1967. Increases were in planetary and space applications program, with planetary increases primarily due to costs in FY 1970 of program authorized in FY 1969. In addition, NASA was proposing Planetary Explorer program and dual planet mission to Venus and Mercury for 1973. Space applications increase was for experimental erts satellite and prototype of operational Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (sms). (Testimony)
Merger of U.S. and U.S.S.R. satellite systems into worldwide comsat link for all nations was proposed in report of Sept. 21—25 international conference at Talloires, France, released by sponsors Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Twentieth Century Fund. In Communicating by Satellite: An International Discussion, task force appointed to consider new rules and regulations for international satellite communications said: “Obstacles undoubtedly exist to achieving the goal of an integrated, global system, but technical compatibility between the two major satellite communications systems—Intelsat and Intersputnik (through the Soviet Orbita)—is not difficult to obtain. Their orbital systems are complementary; their frequency plans can be coordinated; a single ground station can operate in either system, and their transmitting and receiving equipment can be adapted for operation in both systems.” All nations should have access to global, integrated comsat system with “willingness and ability to accept certain technical and administrative requirements” only relevant consideration. No political conditions should be applied to membership. Voting rules should “take account of the special contributions” of countries like U.S. and U.S.S.R. “while recognizing the interests of virtually all nations in the basic rules of operation of the system.” No nation should be allowed to broadcast sound and TV into territory of other nations without their consent.

NASA announced it had issued 12 RFPs for definition and design of Earth Resources Technology Satellite system including study of ground data-processing system. Responses were due June 18. First of two planned spacecraft, erts—a was scheduled for late 1971 or early 1972 launch as r&d satellite to test new technology to verify effectiveness of- earth resources survey from space. ERTS—A sensors would obtain image data in regions of near and infrared spectrum. Satellite, weighing 1,000 lbs, would also carry experimental data-collection system for measurements of remote, unattended sites. It would be placed in sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit at 500-mi altitude to view entire earth in 100-mi-wide increments in less than three weeks for at least one year, (nasa Release, 69-73)

Canadian Isis I International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies (launched Jan. 30) was adjudged successful by NASA. Nine of ten experiments were operational; ion mass spectrometer had been turned off after one week of operation, when it developed high-voltage problems, and since had been used only for short periods to collect engineering data. Low-frequency receiver experiment had been providing indirect ion data, thus compensating partially for IMS loss. Onboard tape recorder was providing excellent topside ionograms of Antarctic area and other previously inaccessible areas. (NASA Proj Off)
INTELSAT conference ended March 21 had made it clear “that Intelsat, in its brief 5-year history, has been an extraordinary success,” wrote Robert J. Samuelson in Science. Its transoceanic satellites, transmitting telephone signals primarily, had tended to depress cost of communications by multiplying available channels and pressuring carriers to lower rates. Satellites had given “third world” nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, previously dependent upon “confused mixture of radio and cable channels,” chance to join advanced world’s communications system. Attendance of U.S.S.R. as conference observer was “sure sign” of INTELSAT success. Soviet decision to join Intelsat might hinge on organization’s decision about its future. Issue was Intelsat’s formal structure and problem was “determining how large a role the United States should play.” U.S. domination stemmed from its economic and technological power. U.S. firm, ComSatCorp, was made manager of Intelsat under 1964 agreement, to oversee satellite design, contract with NASA for launchings, and supervise operation in space. Month-long meeting had not resulted in accord on even draft agreement. Europeans wanted to replace ComSatCorp management with international secretariat to subcontract technical tasks to ComSatCorp and other organizations as they demonstrated genuine competence. U.S. approach was, Why “tamper with a successful formula?” Fundamental issue lay deeper. “Technological superiority . . . creates its own foreign policy problems. America’s Intelsat partners are pushing for a Space Age which—if not truly international—is at least more multinational.” (Science, 4/4/69, 56—7)
Cosmos CCLXX111 was launched by U.S.S.R. into orbit with 335-km (208.2-mi) apogee, 199-km (123.6-mi) perigee, 89.8-min period, and 65.4° inclination. Satellite reentered March 30. (gsfc SSR, 3/31/69)
ComSatCorp announced it had applied to fcc for permission to reduce rates for TV transmissions through Atlantic satellites by about 40% and to eliminate extra charge for color TV through these satellites. Reductions were possible because of availability of Intelsat 111 F—2 (launched Dec. 19, 1968) over Atlantic. (ComSatCorp Release)

Tass said spacecraft would conduct joint experiments with Soyuz IV. Spacecraft established radio contact, coordinated scientific programs, transmitted TV pictures to earth, photographed earth’s surface, and conducted midcourse maneuvers. On Jan, 16 the two spacecraft automatically approached to within 110 yds of each other and Soyuz IV was then steered manually until it docked with Soyuz V. Tass announcement said: “After the docking there was a mutual mechanical coupling of the ships, they were rigidly tightened up and their electrical circuits were connected. Thus, the world’s first experimental cosmic station with four compartments for the crew was assembled and began functioning as an artificial earth satellite.” Moscow TV viewers watched as Soyuz V crew members Khrunov and Yeliseyev put on special spacesuits with new regenerative life-support systems and went out into space through service compartment hatch. Cosmonauts remained in space for one hour, conducting observations and experiments, and then entered service compartment of other spacecraft, Soyuz IV, to join Shatalov, After 4 lirs 35 min of docked flight in low, nearly circular orbit, spacecraft were uncoupled and continued their flights separately.

l/g Ira C. Eaker (usaf, Ret.) criticized mol cancellation in Detroit News: Although 80% of U.S. space budget had been devoted to peaceful purposes in space, “it has been recognized generally that prudence dictated that we should ultimately possess the capability of intercepting, inspecting and, if need be, destroying hostile weapons in space. . . . Cancellation of the mol project concedes to the Russians control of space. After about 1972 the Russians will have the capability of overhauling and destroying our reconnaissance satellites, and they will also be capable of placing weapons in space which we can neither intercept, identify nor disarm.” (Detroit News, 6/30/69)
