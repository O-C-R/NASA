NASA launched RCA-G, third in a series of high-traffic capacity communications satellites, for RCA Americom from ESMC on a Delta at 6:52 p.m. EDT into a transfer orbit with 35,758-kilometer apogee, 176-kilometer perigee, 104-minute period, and 24° inclination, preparatory to assuming station over the equator at 72 °W. RCA-G would join four other communications satellites in orbit (RCA-C through RCA-F) to provide a five-satellite RCA network providing coverage to all 50 states. More than 4,000 ground stations had direct access to these communications satellites, which all carried 28 completely solid-state C-band amplifiers in a configuration that gave 24 operating channels for television, voice, and high-speed data transmission.

NASA launched Intelsat 5-F at 6:26 p.m. EDT from ESMC on an Atlas Centaur into a transfer orbit. This was the 100th launch for LeRC. The 4,400-pound Ford Aerospace-built communications satellite carried 12,000 voice and two color television channels and was the first to have a maritime communications link for ship-to-shore communications. (NASA Release 83-77; LeRC Release 83-25; NASA Dly Actv Rpt, May 20/83; D/SD, May 17/83, 95)	" NASA declared the May 19 launch of Intelsat 5-F successful, as the Atlas Centaur had put the satellite into the desired transfer orbit. After an apogee kick motor fired May 22 put it in near-geosynchronous orbit for initial positioning and preliminary tests, the Intelsat would be moved on station over the Atlantic Ocean.

The European Space Operations Center (ESOC), at the request of the International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT), completed a switching operation on board ESA’s operational Maritime European Communications Satellite Marecs-A that increased the satellite’s capacity from 30 simultaneous voice telephone channels to 46. ESOC completed the transfer in less than 10 minutes; thus, avoiding the need to transfer communications to the spare satellite and back again. The satellite provided the total of the Atlantic Ocean region shore-to-ship and ship-to-shore satellite communications. Marecs-A was providing to INMARSAT its full capacity, one in excess of the contractual requirement of 40 voice telephone channels. The increased capacity seemed to bode well for Marecs-A to fulfill its design lifetime of seven years. (ESA Release, Nov 28/83)
LeRC said that Dr. Henry G. Kosmahl, an electron physicist employed there, had developed an amplifying system that could double the number of channels on a communications satellite. The system, called a dynamic velocity taper, was a “relatively minor technical modification” of an existing device. Most nations had been seeking additional output from communications satellites for voice, picture, and data transmission. However, communications satellites could be spaced around the globe no closer than 20 part; otherwise, the signals from one would interfere with those adjoining. The number of possible communications satellites in orbit was therefore limited, and all available slots would be full by the year 2000. Kosmahl’s idea would make each communications satellite able to .handle more traffic without affecting quality of the signals or increasing the power supply. He had applied for a patent on the device, which would be owned by NASA but available to industry. (LeRC Release 83-62)
Japan launched a second operational communications satellite, Cs-2B (code-named Sakura 2B), at 8:20 p.m. GMT from Tanegashima Island toward a stationary orbit above northwestern New Guinea. This seventh satellite launched by Japan was only the second “for practical purposes”; the first was Sakura 2A launched in March as communications link between Japan’s mainland and outlying Pacific islands. Each communications satellite had capacity equal to 4,000 phone circuits, and the two were designed for use in a major emergency like an earthquake. (FBIS, Tokyo Kyodo in English, Aug 6/83)
Launched January 25, IRAS had already discovered up to 20 distant galaxies too small to see previously. Dr. James Houck of Cornell University, one of 18 astronomers on the three-nation IRAS science team, said at JPL that only 20 small galaxies outside the Milky Way were measured before IRAS went into orbit. “In 12 hours of operation with this satellite, we doubled that number.” In a single minute, the 22.4-inch IRAS telescope found out more about the Large Magellanic Cloud, galaxy closest to the Milky Way, than ever discovered by Earth telescopes. The IRAS telescope, cooled by liquid helium to 2.5° above absolute zero to offset any stray heat that might confuse its imaging, was so sensitive that it could detect an object with temperatures far below that of freezing on Earth. Optical telescopes, by contrast, could see only objects with temperatures hot enough to make them shine (above 10,000 °F). The telescope was built in the United States, the spacecraft in the Netherlands; Great Britain was tracking it. The biggest surprise, said Houck, was that the $80 million satellite was “working better than we had hoped,” seeing cooler objects in greater detail than astronomers thought possible. Over its 12-month lifetime, IRAS could survey 95% of the sky in the infrared, never attempted from the ground. Infrared lightwaves were longer than those in the visible spectrum but shorter than radiowaves. The projected lifetime would probably be extended by 50% because of the slow rate of helium use so far.

NASA launched RCA-F at 5:39 p.m. EDT from the Eastern Sipace and Missile Center (ESMC) on a Delta into a transfer orbit with 36,266-kilometer apogee, 169-kilometer perigee, 634.2-minute period, and 24° inclination, before reaching geosynchronous orbit at 139 °W where for 10 years it would provide commercial and official voice, digital, and video communications between Alaska and the continental United States. Called Satcom 1R in orbit, the 3-axis stabilized craft weighed nearly 600 kilograms (1,320 pounds) and carried 24 solid-state transponders. It would replace the first of RCA’s domestic communications satellites, RCA Satcom 1 launched December 12, 1975, which had served for seven years. Satcom 1R joined five previous RCA communications satellites to provide television, voice, and high-speed data transmission to all 50 states and Puerto Rico. More than 4,000 Earth stations had direct access to these spacecraft. (NASA MOR M-492-206-83-07 [prelaunch] Mar 31/83; NASA Release 83-44; SPX-354; NASA wkly SSR, Apr 14/83)
NASA said that it would have to revise the schedule for Challenger’s first launch because delays had pushed the date past the vernal equinox and would put the Shuttle’s communications satellite payload in Earth’s shadow for an undesirably long time. Liftoff would be reset for 1:30 p.m. EST, regardless of the date, shortening the launch window from 4 hours to 18 minutes, because of the need for daylight conditions at an emergencylanding runway in Dakar, Senegal. Spring would start March 20 at 11:39 p.m. EST. With the sun directly over the equator, the time in darkness between transferring the communications satellite from the Shuttle’s low Earth orbit to stationary orbit at 22,300 miles altitude would have resulted in too much heat loss. All five Columbia missions were launched in the morning, the earlier the better according to NASA, so that the crews had more daylight to work in. (NY Times, Mar 6/83, 38) PRECEDISMG PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED WTfNTinNAI tV RtANti' relay satellite (TDRS) to be carried on that flight. A storm February 28 with winds from 60 to 70 mph had carried “sand, salt, silica particles, and paint chips” into the room at the launch pad where the payload was kept and onto the satellite. NASA said earlier that the TDRS was not seriously damaged by “particulate matter” found on it; however, the contaminants were undergoing laboratory tests, and the sensitive Earth-scanner and tracking instruments were being closely examined. Launch would again be delayed, probably to April 7. Spokesman James Kukowski said that NASA could fly the 2'/2-ton satellite as is; try to clean it inside the Challenger cargo bay (where it was installed February 25); remove and clean it at the launch pad; return it to a KSC payload assembly building; or send it back to TRW’s plant in California. Delays were costing up to $3 million a day in overtime. (NY Times, Mar 8/83, C-8; Mar 11/83, A-14; Mar 19/83, 14; W Post, Mar 9/83, A-17; Mar 11/83, A-18; Mar 19/83, A-10)
NASA launched Galaxy 1, first of a series of three wholly owned Hughes communications satellites, at 7:08 p.m. EDT from ESMC on a Delta into a transfer orbit before stationing it at 135 °W to serve the cable television industry. Hughes had sold its 24 operating transponders on a noncommon-carrier basis to ensure purchasers a stable source of programming. NASA would launch the other Galaxies in September 1983 and June 1984.

The Nimbus 5 Earth-observation satellite would end operations as of April 1, said Dr. S.G. Tilford of NASA’s environmental observation division. Launched in 1972, Nimbus 5 would probably reenter after the year 2000. Its last on;bOard tape recorder stopped in November 1982. The U.S. Navy, the only user of its data, would get this information from Nimbus 7. (NASA Release 83-40)
