First launching of production Vanguard satellite vehicle (SLV-1) generally successful with exception of second-stage burnout which prevented achievement of satisfactory orbit During May: Four-stnge rocket launched a 9-pound inflatable sphere to 50-mlle altitude at NACA Wallops Island.
Second U.S.-IGY satelUte, VANGUARD I, launched Into orbit with life expectancy of perhaps a 1,000 years, a highly suecessful scientific satellite which proved that the earth Is slightly pear shaped. Operating on solar-powered batteries, lt was still transmitting after 3 years in orbit. (See Appendix A.)
President Elsenhower�s Christmas message beamed from PROJ-KCT SCORE satellite In orbit, the first video beamed In from space.
Pravda reported on Soviet satellite findings that Laika's heartbeat had taken three times as long as expected to return to normal. Weightlessness affecting the nerve centers was suggested as the cause. The Soviet report disclosed that the density and temperature of the atmosphere at a given altitude were not uniform, and that cosmic ray luteuslty was 40 percent greater at 400 miles than at 135 miles.
EXPLORER I, first U.S. earth satellite, launched by modified ABMA-JPL Jupiter-C, with US-IGV scientific experiment of James A. Van Allen, which discovered the radiation belt around the earth. (See Appendix A.)
Secretary of Defense Nell H. McElroy testified before the House Armed Services Committee: �Such long-range programs as the antimissile missile and the military satellite programs are In the research and exploratory development stages. They nre Important and must be pursued, but they must not distract us from the speedy development of our other missile systems. To handle them, I am establishing within the Department of Defense an Advanced Research Projects Agency, which will be responsible to tbe Secretary of Defense for tbe unified direction and management of the antimissile missile program and for outer space projects.�
Space program for the United States proposed by the U.S.-IGY Satellite Panel.	,
Wearing a Goodrich lightweight full-pressure suit, Lt. It. II. Tabor (USN) completed n 72-hour simulated flight in pressure chamber at NAS Norfolk, In which he was subjected to altitude conditions as hi^li as 139,000 feet. September 17:	Joint NASA-ARPA Manned Satellite Panel established to make final recommendation for manned spnee flight program.
Scientific findings from the two Explorer satellites disclosed an unexpected band of higb-lntcuslty radiation extending from 000 miles above earth to possibly an 8,000-mlle altitude. The radiation wus described by Dr. James A. Van Allen as �1,000 times as intense as could be attributed to cosmic rays.�
DOD announced details of Project Discoverer, series of polar orbiting satellites.
Production Vanguard satellite (SI.V-2) failed to orbit due to failure of second stage, but demonstrated structural integrity of tankage which with-' stood pressure exceeding design values. successfully completed first military launch of a Snark Intercontinental missile at Cape Canaveral.
President transferred tbe functions and facilities of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif., from the Army to NASA. JPL built, designed, and tested upper stages, payloads, and tracking systems for the first 1GY Explorer satellites.
American Rocket Society and the Recket and Satellite Research Panel issued a summary of their proposals for a National Space Establishment. Preferably independent of the Department of Defense, but in any event not under one of tbe military services, this establishment would be responsible for the "broad cultural, scientific, and commercial objectives�� of outer space development.
Third U.S.-IGY Satellite, EXPLORER III, a Joint ABMA-JPL project, successfully launched by Army Juno II, yielded valuable data on radiation belt, mlcromoteorite Impacts, and temperature before returning to earth on June 27.
NASA�with the Army as executive agent�attempted to launch a 12-foot-dlameter Inflatable satellite of mlcro-thln plastic covered with aluminum foil known as BEACON. Launched from AMR by a Juno I�a modified Redstone, the payload prematurely separated prior to booster burnout.
EXPLORER IV, fourth U.S.-IGY satellite, successfully launched by Army Jupitcr-C. (See Appeudlx A.)
Experimental tests for launching satellites via rocket fired from fighter aircraft conducted by Navy Project Pilot.
In his budget message to Congress, President Elsenhower stated: �Funds are provided for an expanded research and development effort on military satellites and other outer space vehicles and on antlnilssile-mlsslle systems, to be carried out directly under the Secretary of Defense.� The budget for fiscal year 1959 showed that $340 million In new obliga-tlonal authority was being asked for the Advanced Research Projects Agency. No new authorizations were sought for the International Geophysical Year, but estimated obligations for earth satellite exploration of the upper atmosphere under this program were (8,139,834 for fiscal year 1958 aud $21 million for fiscal year 1059.
The third of the Argus small A-bomb detonations beyond tbe atmosphere was conducted over tbe South Atlantic. Instruments of EXPLORER IV satellite recorded and reported to ground stations resultant electron densities, subsequently reported by James Van Allen.
James n. Doolittle, Chairman of the NACA, testified before Senate Committee on Appropriations that �four years ago, about 10 percent of our activities were associated with space: two years ago, about 20 percent; and in 1959 we will be devoting almost half of our time on missiles, antimissiles, and satellites and other spuce objectives."
New voice and teletype messages were received and rebroadcast on command by PROJECT SCORE satellite, and a series of experiments were continued in subsequent days.
