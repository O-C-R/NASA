NASA began a 110-hour countdown to the first of an unprecedented series of US missions to the Russian Space Station Mir. Launch of Discovery and its crew of six--including the first woman shuttle pilot and a famed cosmonaut--was set for February 2. The eight-day flight was to include a spacewalk by two astronauts, deployment and retrieval of an astronomy satellite, and science experiments in a commercial space laboratory. The primary goal of the mission was to be the rendezvous with Mir. (Reuters, Jan 29/95; APn, Jan 29/95; H Chron, Jan 31/95; H Post, Jan 31/95; H Chron, Jan 29/95)
After the successful launch of a satellite called "Wind," NASA gave the manufacturer, Martin Marietta Astro Space, the go-ahead to build a second satellite called" Polar."  The purpose of both satellites is to measure the forces of solar wind. (Star-Ledger, Jan 6/95)
An international team of scientists have examined data from the Japanese/U.S. X-ray astronomical satellite �ASCA� which may confirm how cosmic rays achieve speeds near the speed of light. Enrico Fermi suggested a theory in 1949 in which charged particles are bounced between turbulent regions inside the shock front of a supernova explosion. Bouncing much like a ping pong ball between a table and a paddle as the paddle is brought closer to the table, a charged particle gains energies up to 100 trillion electron volts. The tell-tale clue to the discovery was the detection of two oppositely-located regions in the rapidly expanding remnant of the Supernova of 1006 AD. The ASCA satellite contains telescopes for simultaneously taking images and spectra of X-rays, allowing astronomers to distinguish between different types of X-ray emission from nearby regions of the same celestial object. ASCA was launched February 20, 1993. (NASA Release 95-208)

NASA reported that three years of data collection from its Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) confirmed that Clorofluorocarbons (CFCs) cause ozone loss.  The satellite detected CFCs and hydrogen fluoride, a product of the chemical breakdown of CFCs, in the stratosphere. (AvWk, Jan 2/95; The Grand Rapids Press, Jan 2/95)A General Accounting Office report called NASA's plans to expand and fund the scientific research needed to support a manned space facility unrealistic. The report indicated that NASA's projected $18 billion cost for Space Station Freedom was far too low. The chief congressional critic of the space station, Sen. William Cohen, estimated a $71 billion price tag. (AvWk, Jan 2/95; The Grand Rapids Press, Jan 2/95)
NASA�s unmanned spacecraft Wind, patrolling interplanetary space 662,000 miles from Earth, detected a �giant magnetic cloud� on October 18. An updated �space weather alert� was issued to commercial satellite operators, electrical utilities and other organizations worldwide. The disturbance was speeding to Earth at over 2.1 million miles per hour. It produced a magnetic storm and auroral displays that persisted for two days. Future disturbances are anticipated as the 11-year sunspot cycle is expected to peak shortly after the year 2000. The Wind spacecraft was launched November 1, 1994.

NASA scientists expressed concern about space trash from spent satellites and burned out rocket boosters that pose a hazard to functioning satellites and space shuttles. Instead of attempting to collect such debris, NASA has been concentrating on preventing its further buildup by programming satellites and boosters to spiral into the atmosphere and burn up harmlessly. In the future, however, NASA may take a closer look at the possibility of retrieving space debris. At that point, the research of Kumar Ramohalli, formerly of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was attempting to develop a debris retrieving satellite, should be useful. (CSM, Jan 9/95)
A satellite payload designed and built by college students was launched onboard a NASA launch vehicle. Shortly after launch the SURFSat-1 was separated from the primary payload and moved into a polar orbit. When the project began in 1987, six Caltech students were chosen to begin the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURFSat). Each summer a new group of undergraduates took over. Through 1994, 61 students have participated. The satellite has two experiments: one tests how Earth�s atmosphere affects the new Ka-band being implemented on NASA�s Deep Space Network, and the other tests ground stations supporting NASA�s new Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry project. The latter will be used to communicate with a Japanese spacecraft that will make radio astronomy studies of quasars and other objects at the edge of the universe.

Atmospheric scientists presented some 40 papers or abstracts at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Tucson, Arizona, on the topic of newly-discovered discharges of lightning in Earth's upper atmosphere. The upper-atmospheric lightning materializes above thunderheads and shoots upward, not downward, in bolts and flickers that soar as high as 60 miles above the surface of the Earth. Satellites have detected gamma ray bursts emanating from thunderheads, whereas red flashes have been linked to powerful burst of radio waves. NASA planned to fly a jet loaded with cameras and instruments across the thunderstorm belt of South America in February to begin serious study of upper atmospheric lightning.

El Ni�o is stronger this year compared to the winter of 1992-93, according to NASA scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The TOPEX/Poseidon ocean observing satellite, launched on August 10, 1992, is part of a joint program of NASA and the French space agency. The satellite uses a radar altimeter to measure sea-surface height with an accuracy of better than 2 inches. Sea-surface elevation is related to the heat in the upper ocean, which is important for long-range weather forecasting.

NASA announced the crew members for the Shuttle Columbia STS-75 mission in early 1996. This flight was to be the second of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) and also marked the third devoted to orbital investigations using the US Microgravity Payload.
Industry analysis by the Virginia firm Teal Group showed that almost 1,000 satellites, mostly for communications, will be launched during the next ten years. Most of these satellites will belong to mobile communications multi-satellite systems such as Motorola's Iridium and Space Systems/Loral's Globalstar. The most common destination for these satellites will be Earth low orbit. (Defense Daily, Jan 10/95)
The Hubble Space Telescope serves as an interplanetary weather satellite for Mars and Venus. It shows that the Martian climate has changed since Viking visited Mars in the mid-1970s. The planet is now cooler, clearer, and drier. Venus continues to recover from an intense shower of sulfuric �acid rain� triggered by a suspected volcanic eruption in the late 1970s. Such knowledge of weather is critical to the planning of future missions to these planets. They also make natural laboratories for testing computer models that will lead to a general theory of the behavior of planetary atmospheres. The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). (NASA Release 95-31; Fla Today, May 14/95; AvWk, Mar 27/95; Science, Mar 31/95)
Data from NASA�s Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite indicate that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are responsible for the destruction of Earth�s protective stratospheric ozone layer.

Radioactive debris leaking from a large group of orbiting Russian nuclear reactors make up the puzzling clouds of junk orbiting Earth. This is the conclusion of a team of scientific sleuths who have been sifting clues for five years. The clouds, which seem destined to grow, are threatening to wreak havoc in the most crowded orbit in the heavens, roughly 600 miles up. In all, 33 nuclear-powered radar satellites that spied on the movements of Western warships were launched into orbits about 150 miles above the Earth. Afterward, as a safety precaution, Moscow boosted the old reactors into parking orbits roughly 600 miles up. Published designs of the Russian space reactors show they were filled with sodium-potassium coolant. Liquid droplets moving at kilometers a second are just as dangerous to a spacecraft as a solid object. While the drops pose no radioactive health danger to humans, they will force engineers to add more shielding to help protect new spacecraft. (NY Times, Feb 26/95)
The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) mission will be launched in October 1998. This mission was selected earlier in the year as part of an overall restructuring of the Explorer program.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) shows that radio galaxies(which existed when the universe was half its present age(are surprisingly varied and intricate structures that are even more complex than previously thought. A team of astronomers at Cambridge University, England, is analyzing 28 radio galaxies that have been imaged by HST in visible light, by the Very Large Array Radio Interferometer, and by the UK Infrared Telescope. They propose that the remarkable structures seen in the Hubble images are different manifestations of activity associated with radio galaxies. The new details may be a combination of light from massive star forming regions, small satellite dwarf galaxies, and bow shocks caused by jets of hot gas blasted out of the galaxy�s core by a suspected black hole. The period of strong radio emissions is quite short relative to the total lifetime of a galaxy. (NASA Release 95-133)
