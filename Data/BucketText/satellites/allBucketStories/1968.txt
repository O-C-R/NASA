NASA Administrator James E. Webb, discussing implications of FY 1969 budget reductions at AAS Symposium in Denver, Colo., said he did not find public support for space program declining. Rather, “many people who in the years following 1961 ascribed to the space program a separate, special, top priority status are now realizing, as the national leadership in the space program has understood all along, that the space program must be regarded as only one of a number of essential activities of high priority to which the country must devote substantial resources. . . . The investments made in NASA may well add greatly to the value of investments we will have to make in these other fields.” NASA was “very much in business, and it will stay in business. We are accepting the challenge of the time and will continue a hard-hitting, technically sound program aimed at the most important objectives of the future.” But he described cutbacks as well as elements of strength. “We are doing all we can to avoid terminating completely such important activities as the unmanned planetary exploratory program, but it is not likely that we will be able to proceed with the Titan/Mars 1973 missions.” Saturn I Workshop would be delayed and, “for a number of years to come, missions to use the manned space flight capabilities developed in the Apollo program will be very limited.” Reductions to a budget already “sharply reduced will have many very serious effects on the U.S. position in aeronautics and space. They are only the most recent in a series of cutbacks and, in effect, constitute something like final ratification of a decision . . . that the United States will not, at this time, take the steps necessary to continue the advances of the recent years.” Outlining NASA’s program, Webb said two flyby missions to Mars in 1969 were largely paid for. “Even at our reduced levels, I believe we can follow the 1969 missions with two orbiter missions in 1971, but will probably have to postpone for another year the start of work on the two Titan-launched orbiter and lander missions which we had hoped to fly in 1973.” The 1969 missions “were initiated three or more years ago. We are approaching the end of our approved flight programs. The number of new projects started each year has sharply dwindled since 1966 and we will soon see years go by when we will have very few flights. We may see a gap of 2 years in our manned flight program after the landing on the moon, and a second gap, equally long, after the Saturn I Workshop. “Perhaps the most fundamental decisions ahead lie in the field of large launch vehicles. Can we gap the production of Saturn V or will we have to terminate it?” Question required reexamination of uses of Titan III and of possible development of new, less costly launch vehicles. “Especially important” in this period was continuation of broad program of advanced research for future national needs, including broad university program. (Text) Sen. Gordon Allott (R-Colo.) told aas Symposium: “. . . in the thirty minutes I spend talking about the space program this morning four Tiros satellites . . . will have monitored 10 cloud covers above 40 million square miles of the earth’s surface. . . . During this same period, the Goddard Space Flight Center . . . will have received 340 minutes of data from 37 active satellites; and the NASA communications network around the globe will have sent and received over 750 messages dealing with information obtained from these satellites. . . . “Already the beneficial changes wrought by man’s incredible inventive genius have made their mark. When NASA launched Early Bird for Comsat three years ago, for example, it boosted the capacity of the transatlantic telephone system by 50%. The AIAA has already estimated that this new industry will be grossing $200 million by 1975. . . . “Obviously, this is not all. Too often, it seems, those interested in giving an accounting of the $30 billion invested in the space program stop once they have demonstrated technological spin-off or . . . unmanned communication and weather satellites. The crowning achievement of the space program has really been what man himself, in space, has accomplished during this past decade. For man has ventured into the hostile, mysterious world of space.” (CR, 7/18/68, S8901—3) Martin Marietta Corp. planetary scientist Allan R. Barger, who was doing theoretical work on balloon-borne Venus probe, told AAS that U.S.S.R. data released after Oct. 18, 1967, Venus probe was incorrect. Soviet report had set planet’s surface temperature at about 520° F and surface pressure at about 18 times that on earth. Barger said his conclusions, based on analysis of Soviet report and on data gathered by NASAS’s Mariner V space probe as it flew by Venus’ upper atmosphere, set planet’s surface temperature at about 890° F and pressure at 100 or more times that on earth.

Washington Post article by George C. Wilson logged significant changes in U.S.S.R. space program: Cosmos CCVIII and Cosmos CCXXVIII, launched March 21 and June 21, had been first Soviet “spy” satellites to stay up for 12 days instead of usual 7 or 8. U.S. space experts had said they would have to watch pattern of future satellites before concluding whether purpose of longer-lived satellites was peaceful. Launches had been logged without comment in GSFC Satellite Situation Report but West had evidence that U.S.S.R. had recovered photographs taken by them. U.S. analysts also had noted overlapping by U.S.S.R. of reconnaissance flights, possibly to ensure backup if one failed. Cosmos CCXXXIV marked 100th Soviet reconnaissance launch July 30. Cosmos CCXXXI had been launched July 10 at time appropriate for photographing French nuclear tests in Pacific near Tahiti. (W Post, 8/6/68,2)
President Johnson, in letter transmitting to Congress Fifth Annual Report on Communications Satellite Act of 1962, said: “[Report] reflects . . . steady progress toward the ultimate goal of providing mankind with new capabilities for worldwide communication. In the brief span of five years, satellite technology has grown dynamically. The possibilities envisioned in 1962 have been greatly exceeded.” Communications, he said, must provide “ ‘network for knowledge’ so that all peoples can share the scientific, educational, and cultural advances of this planet. . . . “Failure to reach these goals can only contribute to apathy, ignorance, poverty and despair in a very large part of the world. Success in our telecommunications policies can be a critical link in our search for the understanding and tolerance from which peace springs. Communication by satellite is a tool—one of the most promising which mankind has had thus far—to attain this end.” (Text; AP, W Star, 4/3/68, A7; PD, 4/8/68, 637)

NASA 10th Anniversary: National Space Club presented special award to President Johnson at White House citing his legislative and executive leadership of national space program. At Space Club dinner in Washington, D.C., Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D-N. Mex.) and Rep. George P. Miller (D-Calif.) presented retiring NASA Administrator James E. Webb award for his outstanding contributions to national space effort. In telegram tribute to Webb, President Johnson said, “The Nation is in his debt. He will be deeply missed but gratefully remembered as his dreams continue to become reality in the years ahead.” Telegram from Vice President Hubert Humphrey said, “The span of achievement which measures a decade of space progress is one which should be a source of pride to all of us. Now a new decade beckons, with new challenges, and new opportunities. And, such is the nature of the space age that we dare not become complacent about our rate of progress or the scope of our past accomplishments. It is unthinkable that we would allow ourselves to be surpassed in technology by any other nation. I have never questioned that space endeavors have contributed significantly to the strengthening and enrichment of our whole society, through a teamwork approach by private industry, our universities, and the Federal Government. By means of this program we have vitalized our economy, developed improved methods of management, stimulated our educational system, produced new goods and services, added to our store of scientific knowledge, and buttressed our national security.” Telegram from Republican Presidential candidate Richard M. Nixon said, “The space program must continue to be one of our national imperatives, and it must be supported at a level assuring efficient and steady progress.” Anniversary ceremonies also included open house and annual awards presentation at msfc Sept. 28—29. (nsc Newsletter; Texts; Marshall Star, 9/25/68,4) In anniversary statement issued by White House President Johnson said: “. . . not all of nasa’s accomplishments have been out of this world. Satellites have given us a new look at the world’s weather. . . . They have given us intercontinental television broadcasts, and broken down the technical barriers to worldwide communications. NASA has brought us advances in medical science, education, mapmaking, geology, transportation, and a host of other areas that promise a better life for us here on Earth. Its intensive research and development efforts have given us new materials, products and processes; raised our standards of reliability and advanced managerial techniques. These advances, together with the useful facilities it has built, will be lasting national assets long after the Moon landing is ancient history. . . . “In the years ahead—as in the past decade—our foremost motive is to make men wiser and life on earth more meaningful.

Third anniversary of launch of 85-lb (Early Bird), world’s first commercial comsat, owned by intelsat and managed by ComSatCorp. Originally designed as experimental-operational satellite with 18-mo life expectancy, comsat launched by NASA into 22,300-mi-altitude synchronous orbit over Atlantic, was still providing service between North America and Europe with 100% reliability. Intelsat I had received and transmitted more than 200 hr of TV and thousands of telephone calls, data and record messages, and other general communications without satellite service outage. TV use of Intelsat I increased from 31 programs consuming 31 hr leased time in 1965 to 160 programs and 125 hr in 1967. Highlights of TV broadcasts included live coverage of Atlantic splashdowns of Gemini spacecraft, sports events, public affairs, and news programs. (ComSatCorp Release 68—16)
nasa Associate Administrator, Dr. Homer E. Newell, summarized Earth Resources Survey program at Fifth Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment at Univ. of Michigan’s Institute of Science and Technology in Ann Arbor. Prospects in field were promising. Greatest use of satellites for earth survey to date was for meteorological data, including global cloud-cover photos, cloud motion, and ocean temperatures, but U.S. still lacked “much of the data essential for worldwide long-range weather forecasting,” such as data on three-dimensional fields of density, wind velocity, temperature, and water vapor within the atmosphere. Major contributions expected from research in other fields included: completion of geodetic programs which would permit determination of relative positions of any two points on earth with improved accuracy; monitoring of sea surface state, evaluation of marine biological resources, and surface observations of conditions of interest to oceanographers; and improved identification of spectral signature of various species for agriculture, forestry, and geology.

NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, Dr. John E. Naugle, described OSSA programs before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Three-year budget history of Space Applications program was one of very few in OSSA “showing a steady rise” and increase for FY 1969 was primarily due to increase in Earth Resources Survey Program. “Together with user agencies—the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and Navy—we are studying the feasibility of applying space technology and techniques to such Earth resources disciplines as agriculture and forestry resources; hydrology and water resources; geography, cartography, and cultural resources; and oceanography and marine resources. Data are now being obtained by flying with electronic and electro-optical sensors over geographical areas ... to permit correlation of remote sensor data with actual conditions. ... To complement the acquisition of sample data in preparing for future systems, we intend to initiate a definition and economic benefit study in Fiscal Year 1969 of an automated spacecraft system called Earth Resources Technology Satellite.” (Testimony)

Explorer XXXIX (Air Density balloon) and Explorer XL (Injun V) were successfully launched by NASA from WTR by single four-stage Scout booster. Primary mission objective was to place spacecraft in near polar orbits to extend studies of atmospheric density, geomagnetically trapped particles, and down-flux of these particles into atmosphere. Expected lifetimes were one year each. Explorer XXXIX entered orbit with 1,548-mi (2,492.3-km) apogee, 425-mi (683-km) perigee, 117.9-min period, and 80.6° inclination. The 20.5-lb, 12-ft-dia inflatable sphere was covered with aluminum foil to reflect sunlight and radio beacons and was coated with painted white spots for temperature control. It would extend measurements of latitudinal, seasonal, and solar cycle variations in upper air density and compare previous satellite measurements for further insight into sources of atmospheric heating. Explorer XL, 29-in-high, 30-in-dia, 153.1-lb hexagon, entered orbit with 1,573-mi	(2,530-km) apogee, 424-mi	(677-km) perigee, 118.3-min period, and 80.6° inclination. Satellite’s primary purpose was to measure directly down-flux of charged particles into atmosphere; study geomagnetically trapped charged particles, emphasizing spectra, spatial distribution, and time variations; and correlate VLF radio emissions and measurements of low-energy positive electrons with more energetic particle measurements. Mission was second NASA launch of two spacecraft by one Scout booster. First dual launch successfully injected Explorer XXIV (Air Density balloon) and Explorer XXV (Injun IV) into orbit Nov. 21, 1964.

NASA’s Pioneer IX (Pioneer D), fourth in series of five spacecraft designed to provide continuing measurements over solar cycle at widely separated points in interplanetary space, was successfully launched from ETR by Thrust-Augmented Improved Thor-Delta (DSV-3E) booster into orbit around sun. Orbital parameters: aphelion, 0.99 astronomical unit (au), or 92.04 million mi (148.10 million km) ; perihelion, 0.75 au, or 69.71 million mi (112.19 million km); period, 297.55 days; and inclination 0.09°. Test and Training Satellite Tetr II (tetr—b) carried pickaback on 2nd stage, was successfully ejected after 3rd-stage burnout and entered orbit around earth with 582.3-mi (937-km) apogee, 231.3-mi (373-km) perigee, 97.9-min period, and 32.8° inclination. S-band transponder was operating properly. Tetr 11 was follow-on Tetr 1 (formerly designated Tts 1; launched pickaback on Pioneer VIII Dec. 13, 1967), which was highly successful in testing Apollo communications network. Primary mission objective of 147-lb, drum-shaped Pioneer IX was to collect scientific data on electromagnetic and plasma properties of interplanetary medium for period covering six or more passages of solar activity centers. As secondary mission, Pioneer IX would: (1) acquire data when highly significant solar event occurred; (2) refine primary 'determinations of earth and moon masses, the astronomical unit, and osculating elements of earth’s orbit; (3) provide synoptic study of solar-interplanetary relations; and (4) provide target for checkout of Manned Space Flight Network equipment and training of operations personnel by launching Test and Training Satellite as secondary payload. Pioneer IX separation, boom deployment, and first solar orientation occurred as planned and all eight experiments were operating properly and returning good data. Pioneer VI (launched Dec. 16, 1965), Pioneer VII (launched Aug. 17, 1966), and Pioneer VIII (launched Dec. 16, 1967) were all successful and were continuing to transmit excellent data.

In Washington Post, columnist Joseph Kraft said post-Apollo programs had been sharply cut in Congress and space spending had been compared unfavorably with money for pressing internal needs. “In this situation, it makes sense for this country to disengage while it is ahead. There is no need for the United States to race Russia to every new milestone in space. On the contrary, what the United States wants is a program closely connected to explicit American requirements—a program of exploration for its own sake, not for the sake of beating the Russians. In that way, this country can continue to develop a capability in space, without having to respond in a panic to the ups and downs that are necessary part of the space business.” (W Post, 12/26/68) Outgoing Presidential Science Adviser, Dr. Donald F. Hornig, recommended reexamination of concept of Federal Dept, of Science since science “has now assumed such importance to the nation that its position would be stronger if it had a voice in the Cabinet.” He advocated annual report on state of science similar to annual economic report and said Office of Science and Technology “could eventually evolve in an office of planning and analysis, looking broadly at national problems with some scientific or technological component, but extending well beyond the purely technical areas.” Under questioning, Dr. Hornig said he agreed with Dr. J. Herbert Hollomon, President of Univ. of Oklahoma and former Assistant Secretary of Commerce, that Federal Dept, of Science, with NSF as its core, might encompass oceanographic agencies, high-energy-physics research currently funded by AEC, ESSA, Bureaus of Census and Labor Statistics, geophysics branches of Geological Survey, and some NIH programs. Dr. Hollomon also suggested NASA be added when it could be included “without having it become the tail that wags the dog.” Dr. Hornig insisted no massive “science agency” should be created to usurp supervision of Nation’s science effort. Bacteria might have caused gastrointestinal upset suffered by astronaut Frank Borman on Apollo 8 mission, Dr. Rudolf H. T. Mattoni, head of Biological Systems Div. of Nuclear Utility Services, Hawthorne, Calif., told meeting. Effects of weightlessness on bacteria on Biosatellite II flight (Sept. 7—9, 1967) suggested that lack of gravity might have allowed common, normally benign, intestinal bacteria to cause illness like Borman’s. Drs. Bouilin Browning of St. Thomas Univ. and Irwin Oster of Bowling Green State Univ. reported first experimental evidence that weightlessness can cause chromosomal damage of genetic significance, based on sperm cells flown 45 hr aboard Biosatellite. Cornell Univ. map expert, Prof. Arthur J. McNair, said sophisticated photographic mapping by satellites at 140-mi altitude would provide faster, cheaper, broader, and more detailed coverage than now possible by airplane mapping. Single map-making satellite photo, he said, would be equivalent to 1,000 photos taken by aircraft. U.S. could be fully mapped in one year from photos from satellite in near-polar orbit for four weeks. Another 11 mo would be needed for data processing. Dr. Robert H. Hardie of Vanderbilt Univ. said planet Pluto had appeared to be dimming for past 10 yr. It was moving in 248-yr orbital period to point where it reflected little sunlight and its surface temperature had dropped two degrees. He speculated that planet froze into mass of stone and solid nitrogen as temperatures reached —250° C when facing away from the sun. When bathed in sunlight, planet warmed to —200° C and formed reflecting puddles which astronomers saw as variations in light intensity.

Each side has different examples of its achievements. But in the 10 to 11 years since Sputnik I . . . when we didn’t even have a space committee in the Congress, when we were talking about the basketball up there in the air, when we have weathered the storms that have brewed—everyone who wanted to cut anything, the first thing they wanted to cut was the space program —when we have seen the editorial professors inform us that there was really no value in doing all of this anyway, it gives me great pleasure now to see the thrill that even they are getting out of it.” President described anxiety about complex mission and said he had repeatedly asked himself whether U.S. was ready, whether date selected was best one, whether every possible precaution had been taken, and whether every man had performed his requirements. “About all you can do ... is to pick men that you have confidence in, that you trust, give them the support they need, and then hold on.” Remembering he had “recommended this goal for this decade” to President Kennedy, he said: “There have been many pitfalls every step of the way. I don’t know how many folks have just wanted to abandon it, clip it, cut it, take the money for the cities or the war or just anything else. Space has been a whipping boy. “So when you see the day approaching when visions, and dreams, and what we said to the Congress when we created the Space Administration back in 1958 are becoming reality, you naturally are hopeful.” Later, in telephone message to Apollo 8 astronauts, President congratulated crew and said: “You have made us very proud to be alive at this particular moment in history. You have made us feel akin to those Europeans nearly five centuries ago who heard stories of the New World for the first time. . . . My thoughts this morning went back to more than 10 years ago . . . when we saw Sputnik racing through the skies, and we realized that America had a big job ahead of it. “It gave me so much pleasure to know that you men have done a large part of that job.” {PD, 12/30/68, 1744-50)
Univ. of Wisconsin meteorologist Verner E. Suomi said weather satellite research could reduce critical hours needed to identify tornado-producing cloud systems and warn public of threat. Photos from Ats III had shown it was possible to observe rapid expansion at top of tornado-producing clouds, while radar and ground observation tended to show only their “stems.” With adequate facilities, Suomi saw possibility of satellite tornado forecasts presented directly to the public via television.

USAF attempt to launch record 12 satellites from Vandenberg AFB with single Atlas-Burner II booster failed when heat shield apparently did not separate as planned. Telemetry during launch indicated Atlas and Burner II stages performed as scheduled, but confirmation of heat shield separation was not received. USAF was still investigating launch attempt. Upper stage had been designed to eject small satellites to measure size and shape of earth, provide targets for radar experiments, and test atmospheric drag in near space. {W Post, 8/18/68; Boeing Release S—9805)

nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, Dr. John E. Naugle, presented nasa’s bioscience programs to House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Space Science and Applications Subcommittee. Biosatellite flights D and F, 30-day earth-orbiting missions to study effects of space environment on living organisms, were scheduled for second and fourth quarters of 1969 and 21-day flights C and E for 1970 and 1971. Flights would test reactions of central nervous system, cardiovascular system, metabolism, performance, and behavior of pigtailed monkey. Gas management system for two-gas atmosphere would be flown for first time in U.S. satellite. (Testimony)
In Washington Post, Thomas O’Toole said Howard R. Hughes organization’s holding company, Hughes Nevada Operations, had requested public disclosure of alleged dod study by Harvard Univ.’s Dr. George Kistiakowsky and mit’s Dr. Jerome Wiesner and James Killian. Company claimed Special Report on Underground Testing concluded there was no reason for continued underground atomic tests, dod spokesman denied existence of study, while Science Adviser to President Johnson, Dr. Donald F. Hornig, said only that he had met with top physicists in November to discuss safety of underground testing. “We may make a public report on it. The subject seems to be of enough importance to warrant a public airing.” (W Post, 12/6/68, 87) Primary mission objective was to demonstrate flight operation to support two experiments provided by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Univ. of Wisconsin for at least 30 days. Secondary objective was to obtain scientific data over a range of star magnitudes and wavelengths for at least 50 hr. Experiments would observe interstellar dust and extremely young hot stars in UV portion of spectrum not visible to human eye or earth-based observatories. Satellite would be able to collect six hours of UV data per day—twice as much as had been obtained in 15 yr from 40 sounding rocket launches. Through its complex ground-command spacecraft-attitude system Oao II would be aimed at individual objects in space with precision never before attained by an orbiting satellite. Information from experiments would be radioed to earth as digital data for analysis by experimenters. By Dec. 10 all spacecraft equipment bad been turned on and operated satisfactorily: satellite had been placed in its sunbathing mode with its solar panels oriented toward sun; its six star trackers had been activated; three of the trackers had been locked on to preplanned guide stars; and satellite had established three-axis stabilization. Smithsonian experiment initial power had been turned on. Wisconsin Experiment Package would be turned on Dec. 11. Oao II was second in series of four spacecraft in NASA’s OAO program to obtain precise astronomical observations of celestial objects above earth’s atmosphere. Oao I had been launched into almost perfect orbit April 8, 1966, but had failed because of power supply system malfunction and probable high voltage arcing in star tracker. OAO program was managed by GSFC under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 68—186K; ksc Release KSC-68; upi, W Star, 12/8/68, A5; O’Toole, W Post, 12/8/68; AP, W Star, 12/9/68, A6; SBD, 12/10/68, 172; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 12/12/68, A5)

Study of Northern Lights, auroras, and polar cap airglow by coordinated use of aircraft flights from Churchill Research Range, sounding rocket launches, satellite overpasses, and ground observations was begun by. nasa. During two extended periods (Jan. 18—Feb. 8 and Feb. 21—March 12) NASA airborne laboratory, Convair 990 jet aircraft, would fly over Churchill area and beyond, from Alaska to Greenland. Three flights would be coordinated with sounding rocket launches from Churchill; many flights would be coordinated with passes of Ogo IV, containing 12 experiments for studying auroral and polar cap phenomena. Aircraft would carry spectrometers, photometers, wide-angle cameras, radio frequency receivers, and magnetometer to study magnetic field activity and time and space variations of auroras and polar gap airglow.

Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), Chairman of Senate Nuclear Safeguards Committee, in Senate review of implementation of limited nuclear test-ban treaty safeguards reported possibility of black-out of communications, radar, and missile systems by electromagnetic pulse (emp) emitted by nuclear explosion. If absorbed in electronic equipment, this surge of electricity could blow fuses or disrupt electronic components. Scientists had warned of insufficient data on emp and its possible effects on intercontinental and other missile systems. U.S. would spend third more on underground nuclear testing in 1968 than in 1967. Five-year-old treaty, Sen. Jackson said, was being observed.

U.S.S.R.’s Zond V could be precursor to next step in flying complex unmanned missions to Venus or Mars as well as to carrying men to moon, rand Corp. Scientist Merton E. Davies and Cal Tech scientist Bruce C. Murray wrote in Science. Soviet descriptions of Zond V suggested U.S.S.R. might plan to send pair of spacecraft to Mars in late February or early March. One might land on Mars and cast off satellite to orbit it and relay signals to earth; other might fly by Mars and return to earth with film of Mars surface. Speculations were based on Pravda and Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) articles by Soviet Prof. A. Dmitriyev, which said “information from space” must be delivered “directly to the scientists’ laboratory” free of “encumbrances and distortions of radioed signals.” He said Zond V had successfully completed assignment of developing means and methods for returning space devices. Also, U.S.S.R. had previously sent pair of spacecraft on planetary mission and might repeat mission to take advantage of favorable Mars or Venus positions for flyby or landing attempts.

At international symposium in Washington, D.C., sponsored by NAS and GSFC, Univ. of California scientist Dr. W. Ian Axford explained new phenomenon, “polar wind,” which was constantly blowing away small portions of earth’s atmosphere and losing them in space. In polar regions, earth’s magnetic lines of force plunged almost straight down, leaving considerable area “accessible to space. Charged particles moving rapidly could escape local entrapment by planet’s field. U.S satellites had observed such particles rising toward space at supersonic speeds. They climbed vertical magnetic force lines and wound up in long tail which protruded from earth on side away from sun (distortion of earth’s magnetic field by solar wind of charged particles flowing continuously from sun). Univ. of California scientist Peter M. Banks was credited with deducing existence of polar wind. (W News, 9/18/68, 18)

NASA’s 860-lb Ats IV (ats—d) (Applications Technology Satellite) was launched from etr by Atlas-Centaur booster on mission to evaluate gravity-gradient system for spacecraft stabilization in synchronous orbit and to obtain data on experiments during first 30 days in orbit. Centaur ignited, successfully injecting spacecraft into elliptical parking orbit with 475.8-mi (765.7-km) apogee, 115.4-mi (175.7-km) perigee, and 29.1° inclination. Centaur engines, which were to have reignited to inject spacecraft into 22,300-mi-altitude synchronous equatorial orbit west of South America, failed to ignite. Since programmer did not receive accelerometer burn indication, it did not issue command to separate and spacecraft and Centaur stage remained joined, tumbling uncontrollably, in parking orbit. Three attempts to fire apogee kick motor were unsuccessful because firing was inhibited by separation switches. Efforts would be made to operate all experiments possible, but information beyond proof of operation was not expected. Although exact rate and direction of tumble had not been determined, preliminary assessment indicated rate was too high for successful boom deployment. Ats IV was fourth in series of seven satellites designed to improve spacecraft technology, develop long-life control systems, advance spacecraft communications, and improve long-range weather predictions. First spacecraft to be placed in earth orbit by Centaur booster, Ats IV was 56 in in dia, 72 in long, and would have been 251 ft across with gravity-gradient rods fully deployed. Spacecraft carried four applications technology experiments—gravity-gradient stabilization system, day-night Image Orthicon Camera (ioc), microwave communications experiment, and ion engine—and no science experiments. Ats I (launched Dec. 6, 1966) had exceeded its test objectives and was still operating satisfactorily. Ats II (launched April 5, 1967), though judged a failure because of eccentric orbit, had transmitted some useful data.

U.S.S.R. was expected to make more successful launches than U.S. during 1968 for first time since 1957, with both nations emphasizing military goals, Howard Benedict of Associated Press wrote. In 1957,	U.S.S.R. had launched two Sputniks, U.S. had launched none. In 1958,	U.S. had launched five to U.S.S.R.’s one; thereafter, U.S. had maintained substantial edge, building to 73-46 margin in 1966. In 1967, U.S. had led by only one launch, 67—66. Through 1967, U.S. had had 400 successful launches, with 532 payloads orbited. U.S.S.R. had had 240 launches with 289 payloads. In 1968 to date, U.S.S.R. had successfully launched 40 rockets with 40 payloads; U.S. had launched 22 rockets with 31 payloads, 23 fewer than in 1967, while U.S.S.R. launches had increased by five. Reasons for decline in U.S. launch rate were NASA budget cuts and improved instrumentation and data recovery in military launches (60% of U.S. firings). U.S. military payloads in 1968 numbered 22 to U.S.S.R.’s 24 out of total 40. Tracking experts had reported 16 of 1968 U.S.S.R. satellites on reconnaissance assignments, with 13 reentering after 8-day orbit, two after 12 days and one still aloft. Sole U.S.S.R. Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (fobs) test, Cosmos CCXVIII, had been launched and returned to earth in less than one orbit April 25. Drop from nine fobs tests in 1967 indicated U.S.S.R. might have perfected at least first stage in FOBS development. Neither U.S. nor U.S.S.R. had launched men into space in 1968 but experts listed Cosmos CCXII and CCXIII launchings April 15 as forerunners of manned lunar mission. In 1968, U.S.S.R. had launched nine scientific satellites, three for navigation, and two each for communications, weather, and deep space probes. U.S. had made two unmanned Apollo rocket and spacecraft tests, five scientific payloads, and one moon shot. (Huntsville Times, 8/5/68)

Dr. Gardiner L. Tucker, Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering (Electronics & Information Systems), told Military Operations Subcommittee of House Committee on Government Operations dod would proceed with new phase of Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs), procuring more than three advanced synchronous satellites and developing over six new ground terminals. Funding of satellites, which would use very narrow-beam steerable antennas illuminating 1,000- to 2,000-mi-dia area of earth, would start in FY 1969. dscs satellites would be comparable to Intelsat IV series under consideration for commercial service. New dod phase represented technological advance over advanced dscs considered in 1967 but was less ambitious in cost and size, with cost range of $100—200 million, contrasted with earlier $500 million. Current system had 25 satellites in orbit and operational, each equipped with switch to turn it off after six years in orbit. Number of terminals had grown from original two in field and seven transportable to worldwide operational system with terminals near Washington, D.C., and in New Jersey, Colorado, California, Hawaii, Guam, Australia, Korea, Okinawa, Philippines, South Vietnam, Thailand, Ethiopia, and Western Germany, plus six shipboard terminals. Cooperative programs with Allies in satellite communications included procurement of two synchronous Skynet satellites for U.K. as part of Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program (idcsp) with first launch scheduled for mid-1969. Joint efforts were under way to ensure operability of U.S. and U.K. satellites and terminals, and work was under way to procure two Skynet satellites for NATO under program similar to that of U.K. First launch was planned for late 1969, with U.S. controlling satellite. U.S. had signed Memorandum of Understanding with six NATO countries establishing joint testing program utilizing Les V experimental satellite, launched July 1, 1967.

New York Times reported interview in which General Electric Co. engineers described arms (Application of Remote Manipulators in Space), concept being pursued under $68,000 NASA contract to study feasibility of orbiting robots to refuel, resupply, and repair crippled spacecraft on signals from earth. They could be in operation by mid-1970s and, if successful, could extend useful lifetimes of communications and weather satellites and, possibly, could inspect or disable hostile spacecraft. One plan was to launch 600-lb robot attached to 1,000-lb tender or “home base” satellite. With repair kit orbited on distress signal from regular satellite, robot would rendezvous and repair disabled satellite directed by a ground controller by radio signals transmitted via the tender. After each repair robot would return to tender. Engineers estimated robot could remain in orbit four to five years and would have paid for itself after 12 repairs. (Wilford, NYT, 8/13/68, 4)

Soviet scientists reported that automatic docking of Cosmos CCXII and CCXIII April 15 had occurred only 47 min after pursuit vessel was launched. Cosmos CCXII (launched April 14) was orbiting earth at 225.3-km (140-mi) altitude and 17,500 mph when Cosmos CCXIII entered orbit three miles from it. According to Tass, satellites repeatedly changed their orbits, reoriented, maneuvered in space, and conducted various scientific experiments during four days in orbit. Soviet scientists had reportedly developed three launch systems for spacecraft intended for automatic docking in orbit: (1) simultaneous side-by-side launch with docking maneuvers beginning immediately after spacecraft separated from launch vehicles; (2) separate launches from same or different sites with second spacecraft launched as close as possible to first spacecraft in orbit as it passed over launch site [method used for April 15 docking] ; and (3) separate launches of spacecraft into same plane, but with distances between them great enough to require several orbital corrections and maneuvers to close gap.

NASA launched meteorological satellite Essa VII for Environmental Science Services Administration. Satellite relayed photo of tropical storm Shirley Aug. 19. in sun-synchronous orbit with local equator crossing time between 2:35 pm and 2:55 pm so that daily Advanced Vidicon Camera System {Avcs) pictures of entire globe could be obtained regularly and dependably. Satellite achieved nearly polar, sun-synchronous, circular orbit with 918-mi (1,477.9-km) apogee, 895-mi (1,440-km) perigee, 114.9-min period, and 101.7° inclination. Drift of only 0.002° per day out of sun-synchronous orbit meant it would take perhaps 15 yr to change equator crossing time by 1 hr and added considerably to expected useful lifetime. An advanced version of cartwheel configuration, 325-lb cylindrical Essa VII carried two avcs cameras for global weather coverage. Photos would be stored onboard satellite on magnetic tape until readout by essa’s Command and Data Acquisition (cda) stations at Fairbanks, Alaska, and Wallops Island, Va. During first 42 orbits, spacecraft underwent orientation maneuver to place it in wheel mode and spin rate was adjusted. By Aug. 23 all spacecraft systems bad been successfully programmed and excellent pictures had been read out directly, as well as sequences stored for remote readout. ESSA financed and managed TOS system and would operate spacecraft after NASA completed checkout later in month. GSFC was responsible for procurement, launch, and initial checkout of spacecraft in orbit. Essa I was launched Feb. 3, 1966; Essa II, Feb. 28, 1966; Essa III, Oct. 2, 1966; Essa IV, Jan. 26, 1967; Essa V, April 20, 1967; and Essa VI, Nov. 10, 1967. Essa VII was 17th Tiros satellite launched successfully since Tiros I, first weather satellite, April 1, 1960. All from Tiros III on had equaled or exceeded designed operation lifetimes. Millionth weather satellite photo had been received May 27, 1968. (nasa Proj Off; essa Release ES 68-48)

At NASA Pasadena (Calif.) Office third annual awards ceremony, Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA’s Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, said: “During the next few years . . . our efforts in astronomical observations, in space applications and in planetary exploration, should receive priority. ... In astronomy, perhaps more than in any other scientific discipline, major progress has been achieved when a new observing technique is used. In the next several years we will provide our astronomers with such new observational tools—telescopes and detectors in space above the absorbing and obscuring effect of the earth’s atmosphere. ... we envision a complementary program using both manned and automated observational platforms leading to permanent observatories in space in the next 10 to 15 years. On the other hand, OAO, oso, and the small astronomy satellite will carry the burden of automated observation, while the Apollo Telescope Mount provides us with early experience in the contribution man can make in astronomy. Before very many years, it should be possible for us to move into astra-type systems in which we combine the best of both techniques, i.e., long-term automated instruments in orbit of a cost and complexity which justify their being serviced and maintained by man. . . . “Although . . . post Apollo plans are much more modest than previously announced, even at these reduced levels, it should be possible to carry out some important near-earth and extended lunar missions following the Apollo landings. However, there remains no clear picture as to the future of manned space flight beyond the use of the launch vehicles and rockets left over from Apollo. The resolution of the future goals of manned space flight must await the . . . next administration.” (Text)

President Johnson sent message to Apollo 7 crew: “Everything in the Presidential office came to a halt as Foreign Minister Debre of France and I watched with mounting excitement the magnificent launch of the Saturn. . . .” Message was relayed from Air Force I as President flew from Washington to visit former President Harry S. Truman. On second day Schirra told ground controllers crew was too busy to set up portable camera for live TV coverage because of minor but time-consuming difficulties. Astronauts had to pump waste water manually from spacecraft, Schirra and Eisele had trouble with their biomedical harnesses, Schirra had head cold symptoms, spacecraft evaporator system required maintenance, and hatch windows blurred and were bordered by mysterious “small hairs like fuzz.” Crew fired sps engine for 10 sec and 8 sec to set up rendezvous and maneuvered csm to within 70 ft of tumbling spent 2nd stage, simulating techniques to be used on future flights if LM were to become disabled in lunar orbit. Crew took close-up photos of lm adapter attached to 2nd stage. S—IVB reentered earth’s atmosphere Oct. 18 and splashed into Indian Ocean. On third day crew, which had already accomplished half its objectives, photographed clouds and earth and continued checking out spacecraft systems. Power failure in spacecraft’s Ac electrical system was quickly restored, but overloading prompted officials to reschedule third SPS burn 20 hr sooner than planned. Burn positioned and sized ellipse for CM reaction control system deorbit in case of emergency and set up auxiliary gaging system test. Astronauts, all with head colds, appeared on national TV for 7 min for first time live from space. Crew displayed hand-printed signs bearing greetings from “the lovely Apollo room high atop everything.” Second live telecast for 11 min Oct. 15 showed closeups of spacecraft interior and astronauts so clear that observers could read astronauts’ lips. Third TV appearance Oct. 16, which included nine-minute tour of spacecraft, won astronauts honorary membership in American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Later, crew successfully fired sps engine for fourth burn, demonstrating 20,500-lb-thrust engine’s minimum impulse capability. As spacecraft passed over Hurricane Gladys in Gulf of Mexico, astronauts photographed storm and relayed data to Weather Bureau hurricane center. They also took pictures of “long plume” of air pollution. Crew continued spacecraft checkout, guidance and navigation procedures, and TV operations on seventh day, but fourth telecast was smudgy. Successful 67-sec fifth SPS burn—longest to date—was performed out of plane to test auxiliary gaging system and readjust ellipse for lifetime and CM reaction control system deorbit. On ninth day astronauts showed viewers exceptionally sharp pictures of main control panels in fifth TV broadcast and performed close-order drill to demonstrate movement in weightless environment. Sixth SPS burn, essentially duplicate of fourth minimum impulse test burn, was successfully conducted. Seventh burn, on following day, adjusted time phasing for backup sm reaction-control-system deorbit burns. At 259:39 get astronauts fired sps engine for eighth time, to deorbit csm for reentry, cm/sm separation, parachute deployment, and other reentry events were nominal, and spacecraft splashed down in Atlantic eight miles north of recovery ship U.S.S. Essex at 7:11 am edt Oct. 22 after completing 163 revolutions. Crew was picked up by helicopter and flown to recovery ship within one hour after splashdown. All primary Apollo 7 mission objectives were achieved, as well as every detailed test objective and three not originally planned. Crew comfort and safety were enhanced by change in cabin atmosphere to 100% oxygen in flight, hot meals, and relatively complete freedom of motion in spacecraft. Engineering accomplishments included live TV from space and drinking water produced as by-product of fuel cells. NASA’s Ats III applications technology satellite relayed TV pictures to Europe. Service module sps main engine, largest thrust engine to be manually thrust-vector controlled, proved itself by accomplishing longest and shortest manned SPS burns, and largest number of inflight restarts. Manual tracking, navigation, and control achievements included full optical rendezvous, daylight platform realignment, optical platform alignments, pilot control of launch vehicle attitude, and orbital determination by sextant tracking of another vehicle. Mission also accomplished first digital-autopilot.controlled engine burn and first manned S-band communications. All launch vehicle systems performed satisfactorily; spacecraft systems functioned with some minor anomalies, countered by backup subsystem, change in procedures, isolation, or careful monitoring so that no loss of systems support resulted. Apollo 7 spacecraft had been redesigned for safety. Original two-piece side hatch had been replaced by a quick-opening, one-piece hatch. Flammability within cm had been reduced by extensive materials substitution, and systems redundancy had been expanded to reduce single failure points. Saturn IB launch vehicle carried less telemetry and instrumentation equipment, to lower weight and increase payload capability. New propellant lines to augmented spark igniter had been installed in J—2 engine to prevent failure which had occurred on Apollo 6. Earlier unmanned Apollo flights had yielded all spacecraft information possible without crew on board. Apollo 4 (launched Nov. 9, 1967) and Apollo 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1968) had both been highly successful, completing inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware. Apollo 6 (launched April 4), despite launch vehicle problems, had attained four of five primary objectives and had been recovered in excellent condition.

ComSatCorp in fourth annual report announced 1967 net income of $4.6 million. Highlights in 1967 included successful launch of three satellites (in four attempts) into synchronous orbit to extend full-time service to Pacific and expand capability in Atlantic, beginning of construction on three U.S, ground stations, completion of new ground stations by Italy and Spain, and increase in INTELSAT membership to 61 with addition of Uganda in January. (Text; ComSatCorp Release 68—11) *	Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., in statement before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, described dod activities in space and aeronautics. “Military launches,” he stated, “were intended to implement in part the functions of navigation, communication, nuclear detection, space defense, and meteorology, or to furnish scientific and/or development support.” NASA’s work, he said, had contributed “heavily” to science and technology base for DOD effort. In MOL activities “considerable progress” had been made; feasibility of the MOL system was affirmed, technical risks were assessed in some detail, and full scale development was initiated.” He described coordinated dod—NASA range and network efforts and other cooperative programs in which DOD made its resources available to nasa on reimbursable basis.

NASA, NAS, and NRC would be “taking a long close look” at applied satellites capable of producing concrete benefits to mankind, James J. Haggerty, Jr., wrote in Journal of the Armed Forces. Study, recommended in nas report released Feb. 8, would focus on economic aspects. Among new areas of application proposed were: forestry-agriculture satellite to survey and identify vegetation resources through standard and infrared photography; oceanographic satellite to predict fish locations, isolate plankton areas, and improve ship routing and weather detection through use of sensors; hydrological satellite to aid in management of water resources and to facilitate weather forecasting; and geological satellite to extend process of using airborne sensors to detect minerals, oil, and gas. Group also would study economic benefits of advances in existing applied spacecraft, such as “advanced weathersat” to interrogate high-altitude weather balloons and broadcast satellite to promote “extremely broad program of education and culture.” NAS report had set dollar values on benefits: savings of $8 billion annually in agriculture and construction alone from two-week weather forecasting; $5 million in management of municipal water supplies; and “hundreds of millions” in potential saving to shipping, fishing, and coastal engineering industries, but satellites would have to be developed at “considerable investment.” (Haggerty, J/AF, 5/18/68, 9, 19)
jpl scientists Paul M. Muller and William L. Sjogren, using tracking data from Lunar Orbiter V, had discovered mass concentrations of dense material beneath moon’s surface, centered below all five circular seas on moon’s near face. They had caused acceleration in speed of Lunar Orbiter V spacecraft, while irregular seas had only small effects on satellite’s orbital velocity. Source and nature of concentrations were not known, but their presence under circular seas indicated relationship to these seas. Further analysis was expected to yield more positive information on size and depth of masses, which might aid Apollo navigation and shed light on moon’s origin and evolution.

Four navsats (satellites resembling comsats) in synchronous equatorial orbit could control entire air traffic of U.S. and 18 could handle entire world’s air traffic, according to trw Systems Div., which demonstrated system during Air Force Assn, meeting in Washington, D.C. Satellites would serve as reference points for aircraft in flight, ships at sea, or mechanized ground equipment and could locate user’s longitude and latitude to accuracy within 60 ft and his altitude to within 120 ft. They would operate like comsats but, instead of relaying messages from point to point, would beam signals to aircraft. By taking bearings on any two satellites, computerized unit in aircraft could pinpoint aircraft’s location by radio. Militarily, system could lead to accurate allweather bombing capability and armored column movements in poor terrain or weather, or help infantrymen in the field. For civilian air traffic control, it could overlap existing equipment and eventually phase it out.

President Johnson submitted $186.1-billion FY 1969 budget request to Congress, including $6.76-billion total space budget. Of this sum, NASA would receive $4.37 billion, smallest amount since 1963; dod space efforts, $2,216 billion; AEC space applications, $143 million; and ESSA satellite system, $30.6 million.	: NASA FY 1969 budget, $218 million less than for FY 1968, provided for $3,677 billion to be spent for R&D (down $233 million from FY 1968	and $557 million from FY 1967); $45 million for construction of facilities; and $648 million for administrative operations. Project Apollo would be kept on schedule, development of NERVA I would be continued, and launch plans would be made for two pioneer flights toward Jupiter and one Sunblazer probe. Research on Earth Resources Observation Satellite would continue, but development would be postponed, ogo program would be phased out after OGO—f. NASA’s $2.5-billion Voyager program would be replaced with a $500-million, four-mission Mars orbiter project. Although NASA’s $2.039-billion Apollo budget request accounted for 47% of total NASA budget, amount for Apollo was $517 million less than for FY 1968, reflecting declining expenditures as program neared its completion. Requested $439.6 million for Apollo Applications (aa) program was less than half of amount originally sought and necessitated cancellation of planned 14-day AAP—1A flight. Some $76.9 million—a $10.1-million increase over FY 1968—was allotted for NASA’s aeronautics program, with most of increase attributed to additional supporting research in subsonic aircraft technology. XB—70 and X—15 research programs would be phased out by December 1968. Space science and applications were allotted $538.2 million, with 18 major NASA launches and 13 non-NASA launches scheduled for 1968. Major portions of DOD space budget would be spent on mol—$600 million, compared with $431 million requested for FY 1968., Some $60.4 million was allocated for defense and tactical satellite communications programs, and $10.5 million for Vela nuclear test detection satellite program. AEC space budget—$11 million higher than for FY 1968—included $72 million for Project Rover, with $39 million for nerva system.

U.S. News & World Report said story of how U.S. had been steadily stripping away “some of the most valuable military secrets of Soviet Russia for the past five years” was being revealed in bits and pieces. At heart of story were spy satellites orbiting earth. Powerful spaceborne cameras could photograph in detail objects less than one foot in diameter from 150-mi altitude. “Ultramodern” radar circling in outer space now penetrated cloud covers and forest vegetation to reveal hidden missile sites, tanks, and even troops. Infrared sensors could detect submarines and missile launching. Electronic sensors could monitor atomic explosions and pick up telephone messages from deep within U.S.S.R. or Communist China. President Johnson had said spy satellites alone made U.S. space investment worthwhile. USAF had, to date, launched more than 200 classified payloads. At least one intelligence satellite was always ready for orbit. Most stayed operational for 1 to 25 days. Even more useful, Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) was yet to come. U.S.S.R. was particularly concerned about its intelligence implications. “The Russians are starting now to understand that one of their centuries-old weapons against the rest of the world—their secrecy—is rapidly being removed.” (VS News, 9/9/68, 2)
Barron’s editorial criticized concentration of space funding on manned lunar program rather than on military: “Congress in its wisdom already has curtailed funds for manned flights after the lunar landing— the so-called Apollo Applications Program—and it could usefully wield an even sharper axe. The money might far better go toward the military exploitation of space, which, for the past seven years, has suffered from dangerous neglect. Thus, out of the vast sums spent on space, at most one dollar in six has had a ^military bearing. In turn, with the possible exception of the Manned Orbital Laboratory . . . nearly every cent of the so-called military budget has gone for hardware with a passive or defensive aim, notably satellites for reconnaissance, communications, navigation and weather forecasting. In striking contrast, the Soviet Union has developed and tested ... a weapon aptly known as Scrag, which can hurl a guided missile carrying a nuclear payload of 15 megatons or more into a partial orbit (hence, fractional) round the earth. To anyone in his right mind, FOBS constitutes a gross violation of the outer space treaty, which prohibits the placing of nuclear warheads in orbit. However, according to the confused legal eagles in the State Department and Pentagon (if not to some future hapless populace which finds itself on ground zero), anything less than a full orbit goes. ... In the interest of survival, here is one balance the U.S must move swiftly to redress. . . . The first duty of government is to protect its people. Neither the Kennedy nor the Johnson Administration has honored that trust.” (Barron’s, 10/14/68, 15)
Opening session of 3rd Eurospace U.S.-European Conference at Munich discussed disparity between U.S. and European space funding. Total spent on Western European space research in 1967 was $300 million, 0.005% of gross national product of cooperating countries; NASA budget was 14 times that amount. West German Minister for Scientific Research, Dr. Gerhard Stoltenberg, proposed merger of ELDO and ESRO, 10% increase in total funding, and possible cooperation with U.S. in developing launch vehicle lor use after 1975. International Space Research Committee Vice President Richard W. Porter urged increased cooperation with NASA, which already had concluded bilateral agreements with several countries for scientific satellite launchings, eight of which had proved successful thus far. Some 42 countries were working with U.S. on meteorological satellite programs; 11 were cooperating oil communications projects. There were 20 tracking stations in 11 countries cooperating in U.S. launching projects and 395 foreign technicians, engineers, and scientists had worked in U.S. space centers. European industrial sources expressed hope system could be evolved for joint U.S.-European work on projects. (InteraviaAirLetter, 6/19/68, 1)

Tenth anniversary of first U.S. satellite, Explorer /, launched by abma—jpl team with Jupiter C booster. In defiance of original prediction of three-year lifespan, 30.8-lb stovepipe-shaped spacecraft had traveled 1 y2 billion miles and was expected to continue orbiting through 1968, though silent. Explorer /, currently in orbit with 771mi (1,241-km) apogee, 215-mi (346-km) perigee, and 100-min period, had stopped transmitting data May 23, 1958, after supplying data on cosmic rays, micrometeoroids, and temperature and discovering one of earth’s radiation belts later named after Dr. James A. Van Allen, designer of satellite’s radiation-detection experiment. At National Press Club Ceremony in Washington, D.C., commemorating anniversary, Dr. William H. Pickering, jpl Director, reviewed

Global military expenditures ranked first in world public expenditures. They had risen from $132 billion to 1964 to $138 billion in 1965, $159 billion in 1966, and estimated $182 billion in 1967—record high level. Preliminary data, said U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Report, World Military Expenditures 1966—67, said current military spending exceeded by 40% world’s expenditures on education by all levels of government and was more than three times worldwide public health expenditure. (Text; Shackford, W Post, 1/24/69, A21) During 1968: In 1968 U.S. orbited 64 spacecraft and U.S.S.R., 74. U.S. total included 43 launched by DOD. NASA’s 21 included satellite orbited as secondary payload. Highlight of NASA’s 10th anniversary year was success in carefully planned series of Apollo missions—including first two manned flights in Apollo lunar landing program. Unmanned Apollo 5 and Apollo 6 completed inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware. First manned mission, Apollo 7, carried three astronauts around earth for 11 days, verifying spacecraft operation before splashing down precisely on target. Mission included live TV transmission from space, largest number of inflight restarts of sps to date, and new record of 781 manhours in space. Apollo program climaxed Dec. 21—27 with highly successful six-day Apollo 8 mission on which three-man crew demonstrated operation of spacecraft systems in lunar environment while world watched live TV coverage via satellite. Spacecraft orbited moon 10 times, providing man with his first trip out of earth’s gravitational field and first look at moon’s far side and proving capability of crew, spacecraft, and support and control systems to operate out to lunar distances and return through earth’s atmosphere at lunar-return velocity. Unmanned Surveyor VII, NASA’s first launch in 1968 and last spacecraft in Surveyor series, softlanded on moon, conducted on-site analyses of lunar soil, and took part in laser-detection communications experiment. Applications satellites launched included Intelsat—III F—2 comsat for ComSatCorp and Essa VII and VIII meteorological satellites for essa. Scientific achievements included orbiting of NASA’s Ogo V, Aao II, Explorer XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XL satellites and Naval Research Laboratory’s Explorer XXXVII. Oao II—heaviest and most complicated U.S. automated spacecraft ever launched—took first UV photos of stars, returning previously unobtainable data. Explorer XXXVI was successfully used by gsfc as target in first daylight operational laser tracking. Pioneer IX, launched into solar orbit, carried Tetr II pickaback and ejected it into earth orbit where it served as tracking target for nasa’s Manned Space Flight Network. Some 157 meteorological sounding rockets and 100 scientific sounding rockets were launched, and RAM C—II spacecraft was launched on suborbital mission to obtain data on radio attenuation during reentry. X—15 rocket research aircraft made 13 flights, ending its flight program with 199 missions, including 154 at mach 4 or greater, 109 at mach 5 or above, and 4 at greater than mach 6. NASA—usaf flight research continued with 13 flights of XB—70 supersonic aircraft, usaf’s C—5A, world’s largest military cargo aircraft, made its maiden flight and three of the aircraft completed 31 flights for 88-hr total flying time. Design of sst was reevaluated and program was delayed until new fixed-wing design was selected, with prototype construction expected to begin in 1969. nasa’s HL—10 lifting-body vehicle completed 12 successful glide flights and first powered flight. dod space program included orbiting of 8 IDCSP comsats, 1 Lincoln Experimental Satellite, 5 Orbiting Vehicle research satellites, and 2 environmental research satellites; static test-firings of Titan III—M 1st stage; and near completion of mol launch complex at Vandenberg AFB. In joint NASA—aec effort, propulsion technology highlights included power tests of Phoebus 2A nuclear reactor, first tests of cold-flow test engine in flight configuration in new test stand, and first test-firings of Pewee 1 fuel element test-bed reactor. U.S.S.R. launched 74 payloads, including 64 Cosmos satellites, 1 Luna, 1 Proton, 3 Zond, and 2 Soyuz spacecraft, and 3 Molniya I comsats. Manned Soyuz III rendezvoused but did not dock with unmanned Soyuz II launched one day earlier. Unmanned Zond V and VI completed circumlunar flights and were recovered. Zond IV circled moon and apparently crashlanded. U.S.S.R.’s Tu-144 delta-wing supersonic transport successfully made 38-min maiden flight.

NASA’s Oso IV spacecraft (launched Oct. 18, 1967) had obtained valuable new data on three-dimensional structure of sun’s atmosphere, Leo Goldberg, Robert W. Noyes, William H. Parkinson, Edmond M. Reeves, and George L. Withbroe of Harvard College Observatory’s Solar Satellite Project reported in Science. During five weeks of experiment operation—before electronic failure of instrument detection system—more than 100 solar flares were recorded. More than 4,000 UV images in 52 different wavelengths over wide range of temperatures and heights in solar atmosphere were obtained. Most of emission lines represented had not been observed before with spatial resolution on solar disk. New instrument was being prepared for flight on OSO—G in 1969, to have twice spatial resolution and 10 times time resolution of instrument on Oso IV. (Science, 10/4/68, 95—9)

Strong arguments in favor of Europe’s making comsats “focal point” of space activity were presented in Spaceflight by spacewriter Arthur C. Clarke, former chairman of British Interplanetary Society. “Reliable domestic radio services are not available over most of the world. Long distance services are of poor quality . . . [and] by 1970, there will be 130 million vhf sets in the world, many of which could pick up direct radio broadcasts from satellites.” U.K., he said, “certainly cannot do everything in space. But what we should not tolerate is the apparently invincible ignorance of those who think that nothing in space is worth doing. . . . Our space achievements will be our greatest legacy to the future. Indeed they will create that future. They will make it possible to have a future.” (Clarke, SF, 3/68, 78-84)

Recorded aircraft highjackings had totaled 14 in past year, with 13 U.S. airliners over southern U.S. forced to land in Cuba, Andrew Wilson of London Observer reported. (IP Post, 8/14/68, A3) August 14^-27: At U.N. Conference on Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space held in Vienna and attended by 500 delegates from 74 nations, Soviet Premier Alexey N. Kosygin announced U.S.S.R. and “other Socialist countries” would establish comsat network “Intersputnik” to compete with Intelsat. Draft agreement had been submitted in New York to U.N. Secretary-General U Thant by U.S.S.R., Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Mongolia, and Cuba. Vladimir Minashin, head of comsat div. of Soviet Ministry of Communications, said Intersputnik satellite would have same synchronous orbit used by the four U.S.-provided Intelsat satellites. U.S. Dept, spokesman said U.S. had no need to join U.S.S.R.-sponsored system; Intelsat, with 62 member nations, was already operating successfully, handling 95% of total international telecommunications traffic. U.S. was not opposed to Soviet proposal for political reasons, but on grounds there would be economic problems in creation of two worldwide comsat systems.

Mueller, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, at Vienna conference discussed three results of U.S. manned space flight program to illustrate contributions to space exploration. Program had proved man could live in space and man could do useful work in space and it had created technology to make these possible. In first category, nasa, nas—nrc Space Science Board, nsf, arpa, dod groups, universities, and others had conquered problems of weightlessness in space, heavy acceleration and deceleration forces, air supply and pressure required for breathing in space, psychological problems presented by isolation, and problem of radiation. Successful termination of Mercury and Gemini programs had proved man capable of existing in space. His capability to do useful work in space had been proved by successful rendezvous and docking of spacecraft, by space photography, and by extravehicular activity. Pervasiveness of space technology had been demonstrated by range and variety of thousands of products, including Saturn V launch vehicle, world’s largest flight vehicle, and integrated circuit, one of world’s smallest manufactured items. Dr. Mueller said: “Our civilization has been built upon our accumulated knowledge of the natural laws of our environment. All of our inventions have been the result of the application of these natural laws. Advances in our civilization have always followed after discovery of some one of the missing links in our chain of knowledge. ... We know that many of the missing links . . . will he supplied ... as we move man with his accumulation of experience and his sophisticated equipment for exploration, into a new laboratory . . . the laboratory of the moon and outward to our solar system. ... If all of us, from all nations, are sufficiently creative, abundantly inventive, and freely adaptive, we have it within our power to improve the lives of every man, woman, and child.” (Text) U.S.S.R. Cosmonaut Aleksey A. Leonov at Vienna conference proposed Aug. 15 that Ocean of Storms, prominent feature of lunar landscape, be renamed Ocean of Gagarin in honor of Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri A. Gargarin, who made first manned earth orbit April 12, 1961. Leonov, who took man’s first walk in space in 1965, read Gagarin paper which emphasized similarity between experience of Soviet astronauts and that of crews of deep-sea exploratory craft. He said all actions taken in Soviet space vehicles were tried first in underwater craft. Large Soviet exhibit at conference showed full-scale model of original Soviet spacecraft and listed Soviet space firsts. U.S. exhibit, small because of cut in nasa funds, depicted benefits space exploration would produce for developing countries. (Hamilton, NYT, 8/16/68) J. L. Blondstein of British National Industrial Space Committee told group meeting at conference Aug. 20 that production of U.S. military satellites capable of direct TV broadcasts to military units was “imminent.” He said U.S. had spent between $80 million and $100 million on development but denied information was being withheld for military security reasons. DOD spokesman in Washington had said he knew of no plans for direct TV broadcasts by military satellites. (Hamilton, NYT, 8/21/68, 3) W. T. Pecora, Director, U.S. Geological Survey, said Aug. 23 that worldwide volcano and earthquake monitoring network might be provided within a few years by space satellites carrying cameras and sensing devices to give up to one hour advance notice of strong earth shocks.

NASA has attempted production of the Saturn IB and Saturn V at the rate of two each per year. Frankly, this rate is too low to maintain the progress and momentum so painstakingly acquired in the space program over the past decade. “The dismantling of the high competence built up over the years at jpl and [msfc] has already begun. Both organizations are already losing valuable, highly trained people because of the insecurity and the lack of challenging work for them to do.

NASA Acting Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, announced at NASA Hq. news briefing that Apollo 8—carrying commander Frank Borman, cm pilot James A. Lovell, Jr., and lm pilot William A. Anders—would be launched from etr Dec. 21 on open-ended lunar orbital mission of at least six days. Spacecraft would circle moon 10 times at 70-mi altitude before returning to earth. Dr. Paine explained: “After a careful and thorough examination of all of the systems and risks involved, we have concluded that we are now ready to fly the most advanced mission for our Apollo 8 launch in December, the orbit around the moon.. . . “We have reached this conclusion after a long series of intensive investigations of the status of our program, the flight hardware, ground support equipment, status of our training.” l/g Samuel C. Phillips, Apollo Program Director, cited two categories of new risks with a lunar orbital mission: “In the one . . . the spacecraft propulsion system must operate properly in order to propel the spacecraft back out of lunar orbit and on its way back to earth. And the other category of risks are those that are inherent in being some three days away from the earth as opposed to . . . between a half an hour and three hours which the crew is away from the earth in a low earth orbital mission.” Although increased reliance would have to be placed on dependability of life support and electric power systems and mission would have to take on additional risks, Gen. Phillips said, “The progression of risk between the Apollo 7 mission which we have flown and the Apollo 8 mission which we have designed is a normal progression of risks in a logically stepped development, flight test program.” (Transcript; NASA Release 68—199; Schmeck, NYT, 11/13/68, 1; O’Toole, W Post, 11/13/68, 1; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 11/13/68, 1) Engineer Michael O’Hagan, manager of space and military systems in government contracts dept, of U.K.’s Standard Telephone & Cables Co., told Conservative Party seminar in London U.S. was “actually buying land with mineral rights” in other countries after using satellites to discover its location.

Space Activities and the National Well-Being” were discussed in speech before Detroit’s Economic Club by Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight. “It is a measure of how far we have come in space in 10 years,” he said, “to consider that, with the flight of the Apollo-Saturn V last November, and the flight of the lunar module on January 22, we have now successfully flight-tested and proven every piece of the Apollo-Saturn space vehicle, the vehicle the United States will use . . . for the exploration of space for years to come.” He warned that while U.S. was decreasing its rate of investment in space activities, “Soviets are spending 50 per cent more in terms of real purchasing power than we are. In percentage of gross national product, they are spending 2 or 3 times as much as we are.” He noted that “when we launched our first satellite, Explorer I, the cost was several millions of dollars per pound of payload to get it up in orbit. With the Saturn V, we are now able to put payloads into orbit for only about $500 per pound. Considering that reduction from millions of dollars per pound to hundreds of dollars per pound in orbit over a period of only 10 years, one can foresee reducing the cost to $50 per pound or even $5 per pound for getting into and out of orbit.” Saturn V development should move U.S. ahead during next year, but U.S.S.R. would soon surpass U.S. “as the full impact of the resources they are putting into their space program at this time becomes evident. And I would expect that by 1971 or 1972 we will be significantly behind them in terms of all of the aspects that we now know will be characteristic of space flight.” (Text)
U.S. patent No. 3,380,687 was granted to Edwin H. Wrench, staff scientist at Convair Div., General Dynamics Corp., and five associates for satellite dispenser designed to release cluster of satellites into orbit. Launched by rocket-powered booster and propelled by its own engine after separation, dispenser would release satellites one at a time upon radio commands from ground.

NASA doubled resolution capability of Explorer XXXVIII to map radio sources in space by extending each of satellite’s four antennas to 600 ft by ground command. Antennas, which could be extended to 750-ft maximum, had been initially deployed to 455 ft each July 22. Satellite, launched July 4, had monitored solar radio emissions, variety of emissions across Milky Way, radio emissions apparently related to earth’s magnetosphere, and possible emission from earth’s radiation belt, (nasa Release 68—162; AP, W Star, 9/25/68, A5)
NASA’s six-week 1968 Airborne Aurora Expedition had accomplished most intensive studies ever made of northern lights and had proved dramatically value of high-altitude observatory jet transport aircraft to “stop time” near poles [see Jan. 18]. Expedition, based at Fort Churchill, Canada, with cooperation of National Research Council of Canada and managed and directed by arc’s Louis C. Haughney, had ended in mid-March. Convair 990 jet transport, carrying 13 experiments, followed underneath auroras at 550 mph, making frequent trips to north magnetic pole, north of Greenland; took 40,000 auroral photos; and recorded instrument readings on 180,000 ft of magnetic tape. Jet aircraft canceled out speed of earth’s rotation by flying against it and holding constant position on night side of earth opposite sun at latitudes above 60° north. Aircraft on three occasions crossed same spot on arctic north pole end of earth’s magnetic field as did NASA’s Ogo IV satellite at south pole end, in 400-mi-altitude orbit over Antarctica. Measuring instruments on both satellite and aircraft were nearly identical. In another aircraft-satellite combination, on six passes aircraft measured group of auroras from below at 40,000-ft altitude while Ogo IV measured same group from above, (nasa Release 68—45; arc Release 68—8)

ComSatCorp had notified fcc of its intention to award $270,000 fixed-price contract to Hughes Aircraft Co. for installation, operation, and maintenance of transportable earth station in California to transmit, via Intelsat II satellite, TV coverage of Mexican Olympics to Pacific area in October. (ComSatCorp Release 68—45) During August: In Astronautics & Aeronautics editorial AIAA President Floyd L. Thompson heralded U.N. Conference on Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in Vienna, August 14-27. Against background of new developments in arms control, it would emphasize practical benefits of space exploration, especially as to how they could aid developing nations. “This action by the UN points up the continuing concern of many about the need for cooperation among nations in the exploration of space. It recognizes that space represents an important element of national power, a force for growth, particularly in advanced technology and education.” (A&A, 8/68, 17)
Telescope at Univ. of Arizona’s Planetary Laboratory photographed Lunar Orbiter V as it appeared beyond left limb of moon’s face. Scientists believed experiment to be first success in sending observable light signals from moon’s vicinity to earth. Some 80 photos were made through 61-in telescope by team of three astronomers under Laboratory’s Director, Dr. Gerard Kuiper, in experiment conducted for NASA and spacecraft’s designer and builder, Boeing Co. Satellite was visible on 52 photos. Boeing engineers oriented Lunar Orbiter V so its shiny panels reflected sunlight toward earth. Astronomers reduced stray light near very bright moon to prevent multiple reflections within telescope from reaching photographic plates. Dr. Kuiper explained that spacecraft resembled 12th-magnitude star in brilliance. These reference data, used with radar tracking data, would enable scientists to locate more precisely center of mass of moon with respect to its visible limb. Lunar Orbiter V was crashed on the moon Jan. 31. (nasa Release 68-34; NYT, 2/20/68,19)

Payoff from space investment (in satellite applications in extended weather forecasting, reduced cost, and extended range for telecommunications) was discussed in Space/Aeronautics. Government policy on future satellite applications would depend on four “key study efforts”: (1) study by Presidential Task Force on Communications Policy on status of INTELSAT and its role in global and foreign domestic comsat systems; (2) study by NAS on potential of applications satellites and “an effective cost/benefit strategy”; (3) recommendation by President’s Commission and Council on Marine Sciences for consolidation of Federal efforts in marine engineering and oceanography, and creation of policy framework hospitable to applications satellites; and (4) European organization of firms’ formulation of arguments advocating four regional systems rather than one global network.

Astronautics & Aeronautics published letter from J. Gordon Vaeth of essa’s National Environmental Satellite Center: With emphasis of space technology on applications and practical benefits, it was “curious that . . . little is apparently being said or done about using communications satellites to ‘carry’ the mail over intercontinental distances.” Facsimile techniques were available for scanning and electronic transmission of letter mail by geostationary spacecraft. “In-depth professional consideration of this satellite application is overdue” [A&A, 9/68, 17—20)
