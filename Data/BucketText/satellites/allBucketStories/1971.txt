France’s Eole (CAS-1) Cooperative Applications Satellite was launched by NASA from Wallops Station at 2:39 pm edt. Four-stage Scout boosted spacecraft into orbit with 906.1-km (563.6-mi) apogee, 677.8-km (421.2-mi) perigee, 100.7-min period, and 50.2° inclination. Primary NASA objectives were to place spacecraft into appropriate earth orbit to obtain meteorological data from balloons and to analyze meteorological data acquired from constant-density surface balloons for study of characteristics and movements of air masses. Secondary NASA objective was to acquire technology of satellite range and range-rate system for locating free-moving balloons. The 85-kg (187-lb) satellite—developed by France’s Centre Nationale d’fitudes Spatiales (cnes) and named for mythical God of Winds— would collect information on wind, temperatures, and pressures from up to 500 instrumented balloons flying at 11 900-m (39 000-ft) altitude in Southern Hemisphere. Balloons, to be launched by cnes and Argentine personnel from three sites in Argentina, could be interrogated by Eole day and night, individually, in sequence, or in programmed group of up to 64 at a time. Eole’s meteorological objectives were to study circulation of atmosphere from tracks of balloons, provide basis for standard reference system of pressure and temperature to be used in World Weather Program, and learn more about local winds. Mission would prove feasibility of modified Doppler system plus range measurements to determine accurately location of each balloon and prove out superpressure balloon design and lightweight, frangible balloon-borne electronics. Eole was launched under May 27, 1966, Memorandum of Understanding between cnes and NASA with no exchange of funds, cnes designed, built, and tested spacecraft and balloons and would manage balloon launchings, spacecraft tracking, data acquisition, and data processing. NASA provided launch vehicle, prelaunch support, launch operations, and initial tracking and data acquisition. Data would be analyzed simultaneously by cnes and by Eole Data Interpretation Group comprising representatives of NASA, cnes, ncar, NOAA, and ucla. (nasa Proj Off; NASA; Release 71-144)
New York Times editorials commented on recent astronomical events— Nov. 26 Mariner 9 photographing of Martian satellite Deimos and Oct. 7 report by astronomer Dr. Hannes O. Alfven of discovery of asteroid Toro. Deimos’ photo was “only the latest of Mariner 9’s unique accomplishments. This is the first man-made artificial satellite of another major planet in the solar system and it has already journeyed more than a million miles around Mars.” Barring Mariner 9 malfunction, “lifting of the dust storm in the days ahead should permit even greater revelations of the nature of this planet that has been a mystery to man throughout the ages.” Evidence suggested asteroid Toro might crash into earth after 200 yrs, Times said. “Any such collision could do great damage. It may not be too early for space scientists to begin thinking about ways of nudging Toro out of a collision course with earth when, as and if the need arises. If men can send space ships across hundreds of millions of miles to Venus and Mars, it should be no great feat to visit Toro— a mere nine million miles [14 million kilometers] away at present closest approach—by way of performing whatever celestial engineering is required to prevent a mammoth cosmic traffic accident.” {NYT, 11/27/71, 30)

Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, testified in FY 1972 authorization hearings before House Committee on Science and Astronautics: “. . . true boundaries of our ecological system have not been determined, but they certainly extend to the known dimensions of the universe. The forces and laws which affect the most distant star are directly relevant to the problems of energy generation and control on Earth. Mankind is just beginning to grasp the fact that all natural systems are intimately related and interdependent” and man must learn “to manage wisely what he can, and to live in equilibrium with what is beyond his control. It is to these ends . . . that we have structured the nation’s continuing space activities in science and applications.” Most significant new astronomy program element was heao, “designed to unlock some of the most profound and puzzling secrets of modern physics.” There was evidence that in pulsars and quasars “a whole new regime of power generation exists and operates at levels that cannot be explained by modem nuclear physics.” Understanding these energy processes might lead to harnessing of powers “heretofore unimaginable.” Both planetary and lunar exploration should provide clues to earth’s past and future, to factors that caused long-period environmental changes and how to control them. Earth observations program also was addressed to fundamental problems of environmental and ecological management. Satellites could see, record, and transmit information on causes and effects in global air-ocean-earth interactions. Trend in U.S. space science and applications had been decreasing budget and launch rates; ossa had had to “cut back ongoing projects, dispense with backup payloads, stretch launch schedules and mission intervals, and defer promising new projects,” but had “preserved a steady momentum and a balanced program thrust wherever possible.” High level of productivity in science, exploration, and applications had been possible “because of the background in technology, in engineering, in conceptual thinking that was built up earlier.” But many valuable and important missions had been deferred into future, “a future we expect will permit us to revolutionize the way space is explored and used.” Key feature of this revolution would he reusable space shuttle “that makes access to space for man and machines an economical, routine excursion rather than the difficult task it presents now.” (Transcript)

nasa published Mariner-Venus 1967, Final Project Report (nasa SP—190). In foreword, Project Manager Glenn A. Reiff said Mariner 5 (launched June 14, 1967, toward Oct. 19, 1967, flyby of planet Venus), apart from significant contributions to knowledge of deep space, had achieved secondary objective, “to gain engineering experience by converting a spare Mariner-Mars 1964 spacecraft into one that could be flown to Venus,” with substantial savings. Cost of mission had been 10% less than anticipated. (Text) During 1971: U.S. orbited 51 spacecraft in 29 launches—including Apollo 14 and 15 csms Kitty Hawk and Endeavor with lms Antares and Falcon and their S—IVB stages intentionally crashed onto moon. U.S.S.R. orbited 97 payloads in 83 launches; Japan, 2; U.K., 1; France, 1; Italy, 2 (1 for U.S. on U.S. booster); and Communist China, 1. U.S. total included 33 orbited by DOD in 17 launches and 19 by NASA in 13 launches. NASA’s total included 1 launched for USAF on behalf of NATO, 1 for France, and 1 for U.K. NASA’s manned space flight program continued with launches of Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 manned lunar landing missions. Mobile equipment transporter, used for first time on Apollo 14 to carry equipment and samples, allowed astronauts to explore 3.5 km (2.2 mi) of lunar surface and collect 43 kg (94.8 lbs) of samples. On Apollo 15, astronauts traveled 28 km (17.4 mi) over lunar surface on four-wheeled, battery-powered lunar roving vehicle (lrv) Rover and collected 77 kg (170 lbs) of lunar samples, including one white anorthosite rock about 4 billion yrs old. Unmanned program was highlighted by Mariner 9 Mars probe, which traveled 400 million km (248 million mi) to Mars and began transmitting photos of major Mars dust storm and, later, of details of Martian surface and moons Deimos and Phobos. Mariner 8 launch vehicle malfunctioned at launch. Oso 7 Orbiting Solar Observatory—rescued from initially incorrect orbit by ground command—made first x-ray observations of beginning solar flare and revealed that sun had “polar caps.” Other unmanned missions included lntelsat-IV F-2 and Intelsat-IV F—3 for ComSatCorp and Explorer 43, Explorer 44, and Explorer 45 (the last launched for NASA by Italy). Launched as secondary payloads were Subsatellite on Apollo 15 and Tetr 3 on Oso 7. All elements of Skylab flight system reached final manufacturing and checkout in preparation for 1973 launch and intensive engineering studies on Space Shuttle were conducted throughout year. In joint NASA—usaf lifting-body program, M2—F3 and X—24A lifting bodies made 17 flights, including first supersonic flight by M2-F3. X-24A reached 1687 km per hr (1048 mph) before completing program and beginning modification for new flight program as X—24B. In aeronautics NASA TF-8A jet aircraft with supercritical wing - made 27 successful flights. USN F-14 fighter aircraft successfully demonstrated first automatically programmable variable sweep wing. USA CH—54B helicopter set new world altitude record of 5120 m (16 798 ft) while carrying 10 000-kg (22 000-lb) payload. New v/stol Wind Tunnel at LaRC became operational, providing greatly improved testing capability for scaled models. GE quiet experimental engine successfully completed initial tests in NASA program to reduce jet engine noise, and NASA let competitive design contracts for development of quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (questol) transport U.S.-U.S.S.R. Space Activity, 1957-1971 Successful Launches to Earth Orbit or Beyond aircraft, sst program ended, with Congress voting to terminate program. In sounding rocket program, 126 successful flights were made to study atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomagnetic storms, meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations and to make astronomical observations in x-ray, uv, and radio regions of electromagnetic spectrum. DOD’s 33 payloads included orbiting of 2 Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs-2) military comsats, 2 ov—i scientific satellites, and Cannonball 2 and Mmketball. U.S.S.R.’s 83 launches set an all-time record in number of flights.

Apollo manned missions swelled storehouse of lunar information. Unmanned astronomical missions gathered unique data, including new clues to Martian atmosphere. NASA-developed inventions saw increased use beyond space exploration—in environmental sciences, communications, medicine, industry, and agriculture. U.S.—U.S.S.R. space meetings set stage for future joint space missions. And balanced program of space and ^aeronautics, despite low funding level, continued to raise U.S. prestige as aerospace pioneer while it worked to improve man’s future. Some observers, however, warned of higher rate of technological advances abroad than in U.S. and of ever-growing U.S.S.R. space program and technological capability. Soviet expenditures on space were estimated at level about double U.S. peak expenditure of l°/o of GNP when combined nasa-dod space program was at highest level and four times present level. Dr. James C. Fletcher was nominated new nasa Administrator by President Nixon. President of Univ. of Utah and former aerospace executive, Dr. Fletcher took office April 27. He succeeded NASA’s third Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, who had resigned Sept. 15, 1970, to return to industry. Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, had served as Acting NASA Administrator in the interim. Operating at lowest budget level since 1962, nasa in 1971 continued phase-out of Apollo program with successful completion of Apollo 14 and 15. Man’s fourth landing on moon, in Apollo 15 mission, proved to many that man had an effective scientific role in space. At year’s end, Apollo 16 had been scheduled for March 1972, with Apollo 17 to complete program later in year. Reduced funding forced additional reduction of personnel as well as program cutbacks, stretching out remaining Apollo missions, delaying first Skylab flight, and slowing studies of space shuttle, nerva nuclear rocket engine program was reduced to holding action. Bioscience funding was eliminated. Aerospace employment in industry throughout nation also fell, reflecting cuts in DOD spending as well as in NASA’s. During year, however, Skylab hardware manufacture neared completion and space shuttle work continued. Shuttle preliminary design contracts were extended so that nasa could examine alternative configurations, contingent on Administration approval of shuttle development. In erts program, aircraft tested remote sensing devices for gathering earth resources data and first satellite for global monitoring of resources was scheduled for 1972. During 1971, instrumented aircraft measured air pollution, investigated corn blight infestation, and sought hidden natural resources. Pioneer-F spacecraft for planned 1972 launch and December 1973 Jupiter flyby went into final manufacturer’s tests. Increased emphasis on aeronautics included research into aircraft noise reduction, increased air transport efficiency with use of supercritical wing, and STOL aircraft for transportation. To emphasize practical goals of space science, NASA established new Office of Applications, increased technology utilization budget from $1 million to $5 million, and issued request for proposals for additional uses of space-developed technology to solve problems of society. Among NASA projects were nsf contract to investigate use of solar cells to electrify homes and buildings and hud contract to study application of space technology to sewage recycling. Joint nasa-dot study resulted in recommendations for civil aviation R&d policy (card). Research achievements at NASA centers included ARC discovery of amino acids—building blocks of life—in second meteorite. Discovery strengthened case for chemical evolution of life elsewhere in universe. NASA FY 1972 appropriation of $3,298 billion was $27 million more than requested $3,271 billion and $29 million above FY 1971 appropriation of $3,269 billion—halting downward trend but far below 1965 peak of $5,250 billion.

U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 satellites were “successfully continuing the scientific exploration of Mars and the space near the planet in substantially different orbits,” Tass announced. To date, 153 radio communication sessions had been held with Mars 2 and 159, with Mars 3 fbis-Sov-71-241 )
KSC launch complex where Apollo 15 spacecraft and Saturn V booster stood ready for liftoff had been struck by lightning 11 times during past six weeks, Washington Post reported. First strike, June 14, had been equivalent to 98 000 amps—almost three times as powerful as average lightning strike and two thirds as strong as biggest lightning strike ever recorded in Florida. Two more strikes had followed within 15 min of each other and a 31 000-amp strike had hit launch pad one day later. On July 20 five separate lightning bolts with total amperage July 26-August 7: ApoJlo 15 carried three astronauts on the fourth successful lunar landing mission, returning them with 77 kilograms {170 pounds) of samples after 66 hours 55 minutes on. the moon’s surface.

Ninth strike of 22000 amps had occurred June 25, and last—weakest to date at 6600 amps— had occurred July 19, Neither spacecraft nor launch vehicle had been damaged. Apollo 15 was first spacecraft to have even a near miss from lightning strikes while being prepared for launch. [W Post, 7/25/71, A16) July 26—August 7: nasa’b Apollo J5 (AS—510) carried three-man crew on fourth successful lunar landing mission. LM-10 Falcon landed on moon’s Hadley-Apennine region and two astronauts conducted experiments, rode first manned lunar roving vehicle (lrv) on moon, and explored lunar surface. After 66 hrs 55 min on surface, Falcon rejoined orbiting CSM-112 Endeavor and astronauts transfered for safe return to earth with lunar samples, Spacecraft and S-1VB combination entered parking orbit with 171.4-km (106.5-mi) apogee and 169.4-km (105.3-mi) perigee. Translunar injection (tu) was achieved at 2:56 get and csm separated from lm/S-IVB/iu at 3:22 get. Docking of csm with lm at 3:34 get was shown clearly by onboard color TV. S-IVB aps burns were conducted at 5:48 get and 10:00 get to send stage toward moon. Separated S-IVB/iU impacted lunar surface at 79:25 get (4:59 pm edt July 29) at 1° south latitude and 11.9° west longitude, 188 km (117 mi) northeast of Apollo 14 landing site and 355 km (221 mi) northeast of Apollo .12 landing site. Impact was detected by Apollo 14 seismometer 37 sec after impact and by Apollo 12 seismometer 55 sec after impact. . First midcourse correction (MCC-1) was canceled because spacecraft trajectory was near nominal. Shortly after csm-lm docking, telemetry data indicated electrical short in service propulsion system (sps). Troubleshooting isolated problem and MCC—2 at 28:41 get used sps bank A to analyze apparent intermittent short. Data indicated bank A could be safely operated manually. Modified procedures were developed for using bank B alone for remaining midcourse corrections except lunar orbit and transearth insertions, which would be dual bank burns. Scott and Irwin entered lm at 33:56 get, 50 min earlier than planned, to check out LM communications and other systems. TV pictures of csm and lm interiors were shown between 34:55 and 35:46 get. During checkout crew discovered range/range-rate exterior glass cover had broken, removing helium barrier. Crew began lm housekeeping V/2 hrs earlier than scheduled and vacuumed broken glass. At 61:13 Get, during preparations for water chlorination, water leak developed in cm chlorination septum gland but was stopped by crew, following repair instructions from ground, and water was absorbed with towels. Door of scientific instrument module (sim) was jettisoned at 74:06 get. July 29—August 4: Apollo 15 entered lunar orbit with 314.8-km (195.6-mi) apolune and 107.5-km (66.8-mi) perilune after LOI burn at 78:32 get (4:06 pm edt July 29). “This is really profound . . . it’s fantastic,” Scott said of view from moon. Apennine Mountains looked unreal. “They stand out in tremendous relief. They appear to be smooth or rounded. But they are cratered and in many places rough in texture. We don’t see any jagged peaks. They don’t look like . . . any other mountains we’ve seen on earth.” csm-lm undocking and separation maneuver was initiated during 12th lunar revolution, on far side of moon at 100:14 get, but spacecraft did not undock. Worden entered tunnel to inspect csm—LM umbilical and found plug was loose. After he reconnected plug and adjusted spacecraft attitude, undocking and separation were achieved at 100:39 get—about 25 min later than planned. lm Falcon touched down in moon’s Hadley-Apennine region near Salyut Crater at 104:42 get (6:16 pm edt July 30) about 600 m (656 yds) north-northwest of planned target. “OK Houston,” Scott said after touchdown, “the Falcon is on the plain at Hadley.” He said LM’s engine had stirred up so much dust that landing site had been completely obscured from 15-m (50-ft) altitude to touchdown: “We flew ifr from then on down.”	> Stand-up extravehicular activity (seva) to observe and photograph landing site and surrounding area began after cabin depressurization at 106:43 get. Scott put his head out of upper hatch and described and photographed area for 33 min. Scott said he could describe site July 29-August 4; Apollo IS entered lunar orbit July 29 and the lm Falcon touched down in the moon’s Hadley-Apennine region July SO for three eva periods of exploration. The lunar room# vehicle Rover, deployed during the first EVA July 31, was photographed by Astronaut James B. Irwin near Hadley RiUe (right center above), with the Hadley Delta in the background and St. George Crater partially visible at the upper right edge. Astronaut David R. Scott was working at the Rover. In the photo at right Irwin scooped a trench, with Mount Hadley in the background. A gnomon indicated the local vertical and the sun angle. Meanwhile CM pilot Alfred M. Worden, orbiting Hie moon in Endeavor, completed lunar and astronomic photography. for hours. Area was covered with craters, but strewn with very few large boulders; it was hilly, hut not rocky or rugged. First EVA began July 31 at 9:04 am EDT. Scott climbed down ladder, deployed mesa containing camera which recorded his descent, and stepped on lunar surface. Irwin followed and, while Scott removed TV camera from mesa and deployed it on tripod, Irwin collected contingency sample. Crew had difficulty deploying lev Rover; during checkout they found that front steering mechanism was inoperative and that there were no readouts on lev battery No. 2 amp-volt meter. Battery was found to be operating satisfactorily and decision was made to perform EVA-1 without LEV front-wheel steering. Crew mounted LEV and proceeded on EVA-1 traverse at 121:45 CET. Crew described EVA as “exploration at its greatest," and repeatedly used words “fantastic,” “breathtaking,” and “spectacular” to describe features as they rode Lrv at about eight km per hr {five mph). Scott said Rover handled quite well: “It negotiates small craters quite well, although there is a lot of roll. The steering is quite responsive . . . and 1 can maneuver pretty well. . . . There is no accumulation of dirt in the wire wheels.” Stops at stations where crew collected lunar samples and took photos were broadcast on TV with excellent transmission. At end of traverse alsef was deployed. Scott and Irwin reentered LM after 6 hrs 33 min exploring surface, 28 min sooner than planned because Scott used up more oxygen than anticipated.	' After resting inside LM, recharging and repairing portable life support system (plss), and reviewing plans for second EVA, astronauts left LM at 142:15 get (7:49 am Edt Aug. 1). Lrv was powered up, circuit breakers were cycled, and lrv front steering was found to be completely operational. EVA—2 traverse included stops at Spur Crater, Dune Crater, Hadley Plains, and area between Spur and Window craters. Numerous samples and photos were obtained and TV transmission was good. Crew completed heat Sow experiment initiated during EVA—1, collected core sample, and deployed U.S. flag. After stowing sample container and him in LM, astronauts reentered LM at 149:27 GET, after 7 hrs 12 min on surface during EVA-2. Third eva began at 163:18 get (4:52 am edt Aug. 2), 1 hr 45 min later than planned because of cumulative changes in surface activities timeline. Late start and requirement to protect nominal liftoff time required shortening EVA. Alternate EVA plan was devised with traverse west from lm to Hadley Rifle. Astronauts traveled to Scarp Crater, “The Terrace” near Rim Crater, and Rim Crater, collecting samples and photographing lunar surface features. Scott tripped over a rock July 29-August 4: The command and service modules were photographed in lunar orbit from the lunar module, giving a view of the scientific instrument module (sim) bay, housing cameras and sensors to record data from the moon’s surface and atmosphere. and fell, but experienced no difficulty in getting up. Astronauts retrieved drill-core-stern sections and samples near ALSEP, returned to LM, off-loaded LRV and stationed it for TV coverage of lm liftoff, and reentered lm at 168:08 get, after 4 hrs 50 min—bringing total EVA time to 18 hrs 35 min. While lm was on moon Worden, orbiting moon in Endeavor, completed lunar and astronomic photography and prepared for rendezvous. His observations included discovery of fields of cinder cones made by volcanic eruptions, delineation of landslide or rock glacier on northwest rim of crater on lunar farside, interpretation of ray-excluded 2one around crater P roc ulus as result of fault system, and discovery of layers on interior walls of several craters, suggesting volcanic collapse craters of calderas in maria. Scott and Irwin depressurized LM, discarded excess equipment, repressurized LM, and lifted off lunar surface with 77 kg (170 lbs) of lunar samples at 171:34' get (1:11 pm edt Aug. 2)—66 hrs 55 min after landing on moon. Liftoff, accompanied by usaf anthem “Off We Go Into The Wild Blue Yonder” taped and broadcast by astronauts from LM, was photographed in color by camera on LRV left on moon and was seen by millions of TV viewers. Spacecraft docked successfully at 173:36 GET, as TV viewers watched. Scott and Irwin transferred from LM to csm with samples, equipment, and film, csm-lm separation and LM jettison were delayed one revolution to verify that CSM and LM hatches were completely sealed, LM ascent stage was jettisoned and intentionally crashed onto lunar surface at 26° 22' north latitude and 15' east longitude at 181:30 get, 93 km (59 mi) west of Apollo 15 alsep site. Impact was recorded by Apollo 12, Apollo 14, and Apollo 15 seismometers. Orbit-shaping maneuver was performed during 73rd lunar revolution in preparation for subsatellite launch. Scientific subsatellite was launched at 222:39 get (4:13 pm edt Aug. 4) into lunar orbit with 141.3-km (87.8-mi) apolune and 102.0-km (63.4-mi) perilune. Hexagonal, 36-kg (80-lb) satellite 79 cm (31 in) long and 36 cm (14 in) in diameter carried three experiments and was housed in SIM bay with seven other new experiments. Satellite extended three l^-m (5-ft) booms, one with magnetometer to measure interplanetary and earth magnetic fields near moon and two for stabilization. Satellite also carried charged-particle sensors and equipment to detect variations in lunar gravity caused by mascons. Transearth injection maneuver at 223:49 get put CSM on trajectory for home after 85 hrs 18 min (74 revolutions) in lunar orbit. cm Endeavour separated from sm at 294:44 get. Drogue and main parachutes deployed but one of three main parachutes partially closed during descent, causing harder landing than expected. CM splashed down in mid-Pacific about 10.1 km (5.5 nm) from recovery ship U.S.S. Okinawa at 295:12 get (4:47 pm edt Aug. 7)-—12 days 7 hrs 12 min after liftoff. Astronauts, wearing fresh flight suits, were carried by helicopter to biomed area* on recovery ship for post-flight examinations. After being declared in very good shape, astronauts were flown on following day to Hickam afb, Hawaii, and to Ellington afb, Tex. CM was retrieved and placed on board recovery ship. Lunar samples, data, and equipment were flown to Ellington afb, and cm was off-loaded at San Diego. Mission achieved primary Apollo 15 objectives: to make seleno-logical survey and sampling of materials in preselected area of Hadley-Apennine region; emplace and activate surface experiments; evaluate capability of Apollo equipment to provide extended lunar surface stay time, increased eva operations, and surface mobility; and conduct inflight experiments and photographic tasks from lunar orbit. Launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performance were near nominal except for intermittent short circuit in Delta V thrust switch A, CSM—LM failure to undock properly, and increase in CM tunnel pressure preceding lm jettison. Flight crew performance was excellent. Accomplishments included first use of Lrv, lunar surface navigation device, direct lunar communications without lm relay, and ground-controlled remotely operated TV camera on moon; largest payload in earth orbit (140 310 kg; 309 330 lbs) and largest payload in lunar orbit (33 803 kg; 74 522 lbs); longest lunar surface stay time, lunar surface eva, distance traversed on lunar surface (28 km; 17.4 mi), and lunar orbit time (74 orbits); first subsatellite launched in lunar orbit; and largest amount of lunar samples brought to earth. Apollo 15 was 12th Apollo mission to date, 9th manned Apollo mission, and 4th successful lunar landing mission. Apollo 14 mission had been conducted Jan. 31—Feb. 3. Apollo program was directed by OMSf; msc was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, MSFC for Saturn V launch vehicle, and Ksc for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by CSFC under overall direction of otda.

Time magazine reviewed Secret Sentries in Space by Philip J. Klass. “No one else has written in comparable detail about spy satellites,” Time said. Klass had described latest U.S. SAMOS (satellite and missile observations system). “Big Bird” was 10 900-kg (12-ton) spacecraft capable of operating in orbit for several months. It could transmit high-quality pictures by radio and eject capsules of exposed film, which then dropped by parachute. Big Bird also included infrared heat-sensing equipment that allowed it to “see” through ice and snow to locate Soviet underground weapons. Klass had reported heaviest concentration of long-range Soviet missiles in Siberia and behind Ural mountains in Central Asia. (Time, 8/30/71, 26)
Two usaf comsats launched Nov. 2 from etr by Titan IIIC as part of improved series of Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs) satellites were in operational modes as programmed. After insertion into synchronous orbit over Pacific, first satellite had failed to turn on its telemetry system. Second satellite had turned on telemetry, but telemetry was sporadic. Subsequent efforts of ground controllers were successful and both satellites responded to ground commands. (SBD, 11/11/71, 55)

Chinese Communists were building missile tracking ship that could be used in Pacific for tracking and analyzing test-firing of icbms capable of application against European portion of U.S.S.R. and U.S., Christian Science Monitor reported. Monitor s sources in Washington, D.C., had said ship could be used to spy on U.S. and Soviet missile work and to expand Chinese satellite program into wider areas. (Ashworth, CSM, 12/23/71, 1)
Locked-on antenna control system on NASA’s Ats 3 applications technology satellite (launched Nov. 5, 1967) had caused satellite to stop transmitting data temporarily, NASA announced. Officials believed antenna, on top and north side of spacecraft, had overheated and stopped spinning when sun was north of equator during summer. Antenna had operated sporadically during July and August, but officials said malfunctioning was consistent with similar past problems and antenna would recover as sun moved south.

nasa launched two Areas sounding rockets. Boosted Areas I, launched from Churchill Research Range, carried Univ. of Houston experiment to 64.9-km (40.3-mi) to measure low-altitude x-ray spectrum and electron flux above 30 500 m (100 000 ft). Rocket and instruments functioned satisfactorily. Data would be correlated with high-altitude data from Black Brant launched 30 sec earlier by Canadian National Research Council. Areas launched from Barking Sands, Kauai, Hawaii, carried GSFC experiment to 58.6-km (36.4-mi) altitude to obtain ozone measurements in conjunction with overpass of Nimbus IV satellite. Rocket and instruments functioned satisfactorily. Launch was second in series of two; first had been launched Feb. 24. (nasa Rpts srl)
Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, testified on aerospace unemployment before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1972 authorization hearings: From number of studies of unemployment of scientists and engineers, estimated 30 000 to 40 000 were out of work at end of 1970. “The majority of these came from aerospace-related industries. Projections indicate that this number could more than double by June 1972, which means that as many as 30 percent of the Nation’s aerospace scientists and engineers will be unemployed. The effect of this national trend—in terms of an individual scientist or engineer being reemployed—is magnified by the concentration of this unemployment, geographically and by training and experience. . . . This not only causes great personal hardship but . . . represents the loss of a tremendous national resource.” NASA-sponsored survey by Battelle Memorial Institute of persons laid off by group of nasa contractors from June 1968 to September 1970 had made preliminary findings: only 31% had found permanent jobs, 32% had found temporary jobs, 32% were still unemployed, and 5% had left work-force. Average person was unemployed 31 weeks. Of those who had found permanent jobs, only 18% returned to aerospace. Of those permanently employed outside of aerospace, only 12% reported having positions highly related to aerospace skills and 50% reported new positions unrelated to aerospace. Unemployment rate of those over 50 was 48%. Of those who had found permanent work outside, 31% said they would not return to aerospace if given opportunity; 16% said they would. Preliminary results of survey indicated “we are losing much of the aerospace capability that is an indispensable ingredient of our long term economic strength and national security.” In closing, Dr. Low made point that there was “no either/or choice between technological advances and social advances. Without technology, we cannot maintain the capability to deal effectively with any national problem.” Dr. Low was questioned on his testimony that U.S.S.R. was spending more on R&D than U.S. was spending in total science and technology area. He answered that Soviet space program, with apparent Soviet policy of steadily increasing r&d investment, would soon match and then surpass U.S. program in size and accomplishment. “For this comparison, I am dealing with the combined civil and military space programs of both nations; to try to differentiate between civil and military activities of the U.S.S.R. would be speculative at best. The most difficult comparison to try to make between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. economies or programs is in terms of absolute costs: each national economy is geared and motivated to produce a different, nonparallel mix of goods and services.” (CR, 7/31/71, E8611—2) Dale D. Myers, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, discussed future of Apollo program: “We can now move with confidence to the final phase. ... In these last missions, we will expand the capability of the system very dramatically. Design changes in the spacecraft and supporting equipment will allow the two astronauts in the lunar module to remain on the moon up to 67 hours, as compared with 34 hours on Apollo 14. The scientific payload landed on the moon will be doubled to above 1200 lbs [544 kg]. Changes in the command and service modules will permit up to 10 days total flight time and major increases in orbital scientific activities. During the Apollo 15 and 16 missions small subsatellites will be placed in lunar orbit and will continue to make scientific measurements long after the astronauts return to earth.” In Skylab program, “three separate three-man Skylab flight crews will be selected during the coming year. Scientist astronauts will be included. . . . They plan to perform about 50 experiments in various disciplines. Twenty of these are in the life sciences, to determine how human beings adjust and perform under the conditions of prolonged space flight, up to 2 months’ duration. “They will also operate the Skylab Earth Resources Experiment Package in the second space flight phase of NASA’s earth resources program. These observations will be in conjunction with [and] complementary to those [of] the automated earth resources test technology erts, to be launched in 1972.” FY 1972 request for space shuttle of $100 million would provide for broad spectrum of studies, including analysis of new alloys and promising external materials for thermal protection; test demonstrations of design concepts for structures; wind-tunnel tests to define aerodynamic heating, launch aerodynamics, etc.; design of long-leadtime hardware, subsystems, and test devices; initiation of scaled model for flight tests; dynamics testing; electronic-data-bus-system demonstration testing; and integration of upgraded fuel-cell electrical power subsystem with other components for proof-of-concept testing. (Transcript) Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, testified on dod applications of space transportation system and dod-nasa teamwork on space shuttle: “Present dod satellite communications program consists of two major systems: The long distance point to point or strategic system and the local-area multiple-user or tactical system. . . . We are pursuing a new system called Defense Satellite Communications System, Phase II, which can provide many voice channels to selected limited areas of the earth. These present and proposed systems give us the flexibility for voice and teletype communications from our forces overseas and allow rapid transmission of photographic images from operational theaters to the United States.” In conjunction with NASA studies, usaf was analyzing defense applications of space shuttle to provide better insight into utility of concept for dod. usaf was providing NASA with data to help ensure that configuration was of maximum utility to dod. nasa and usaf had worked jointly on engine development. Air Force “has supported advanced development efforts on liquid rocket engines in the past, and more recently concluded a hydrogen/oxygen high performance engine demonstration program.” Engine, XLR-129, had “provided the basis for selection of the reusable high pressure rocket engine concept for the shuttle. It also provided design data for a 250 000-pound [1100-kilonewton] thrust engine which supports the current shuttle engine design concepts.” In operational testing area, “usaf and NASA recently conducted unpowered approach and landing demonstrations with F—Ills and B-52s. . . . These demonstrations investigated terminal area energy management for maneuvering reentry vehicles and have a relationship to the Space Shuttle operational concepts.” (Transcript)

Bell Aerospace Rendezvous articles described GSFC-devised positionlocation and aircraft communications experiment (place) to test feasibility of transoceanic air traffic control system that would use earth-orbit satellites. Experiment was designed following earlier mission analyses by erc. “Scheduled for 1973, the year-long experiment will determine the technical and operational feasibility of using communications satellites to give ground control centers precise and uninterrupted readings and control of air traffic over the North Atlantic 24 hours a day.” Experiment would employ two satellites—Ats 5 launched Aug. 12, 1969) and ats-f (to be launched in 1973)—and three ground stations, place would be able automatically to pinpoint to within one mile [1.6 km] actual positions of up to 250 aircraft, update information once a minute, and predict locations between updates. Operational place system could reduce flight-corridor widths to 48 km (30 mi) and aircraft spacings from 15- to 5-min intervals, permitting same corridors to accommodate 12 times as much traffic without affecting flight safety. In bad weather, place could simultaneously reroute every aircraft within flight corridor. Although place was geared only to North Atlantic air traffic, “it is the forerunner of what could become a worldwide satellite air traffic and surface control network.” (Rendezvous, Summer/Fall, 71, 9—11; Aerospace Technology, 2/26/68, 33)
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey (D-Minn.)—who had been Vice President under President Johnson-—addressed Space Seminar of Hugh O’Brian Youth Foundation at KSC: “One of the reasons that I have been active in the Space Program is because I believe that this program did something for all of the things I thought were important in life.” Space program was “pioneer in beginning to make the discovery in environmental control.” It had proved men could live in pure environment and “that there’s a relationship between the living space that we have and the number of people that can be there . . . [and] that you can have clean water and clean air. And it’s proven to us that you can work together.” Space program had helped produce computer and had developed satellite monitoring system. Possibly “one of the greatest efforts for world peace has come right out of the science and technology of space research.” Sen. Humphrey recalled his role as negotiator of Nuclear Test Ban Treaty: “I went to Moscow when it was signed. I have the pen that President Kennedy used to sign the treaty ... he said, ‘I give you this pen, Hubert, because it’s your treaty.’ ” He had been in Moscow when Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong made first moon walk. “I was in the offices of Pravda and Izvestia . . . and a dispatch came through from Reuters . . . noting that the launch had been successful, and I had said to the editors of Pravda, ‘Why don’t you run this as a headline?’ There was nothing in their paper that indicated that our launch had taken place. And when I went to Izvestia the same afternoon I said ‘Look, the launch has taken place and I see nothing in your headlines in your papers.’ I am happy to tell you that they were somewhat embarrassed and the next morning, at the National Hotel, under my door was a copy of Pravda and Izvestia with front page stories saying that there had been a successful launch.” When Neil Armstrong “touched down that Sunday night . . . the only information that I was able to get was out of the Voice of America through the United States Embassy because the Russians had blacked out.” (CR, 6/18/71, H5484-7)
French cnes satellite control station at Bretigny, France, inadvertently transmitted destruct command to balloons being tracked by Eole satellite (launched Aug. 16), causing 70 of 135 flying balloons to be cut down. Although error was not expected to degrade planned scientific accomplishments of mission significantly, it would delay beginning of scientific experiment by 7 to 10 days, cnes instituted new training procedures to Eole control station personnel on transmitting commands to satellite and designed system which would alarm when certain critical commands—such as balloon destruct, gravity gradient retraction, and activation of magnetic hysteris rods—were to be placed into Eole.

White House announced President Nixon’s approval of U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreements negotiated at salt to reduce risk of outbreak of nuclear war and to improve and modernize Washington-Moscow direct communications link. Both nations would guard against accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons, arrange for rapid communication should danger of nuclear war arise, and notify each other in advance of certain planned missile launches. Two satellite circuits would be established, one by each nation, as well as multiple terminals to increase reliability of link. U.S.S.R. would provide circuit through its own satellite system and U.S. would arrange for channel through intelsat system. Agreements were to be signed in Washington Sept. 30. (PD, 9/27/71, 1318-9)

NASA released Jan. 28 briefing on FY 1972 budget request, in which Dr. George M. Low, NASA Acting Administrator, said: “For the past several years we have reported ... a further decrease in budget authority. This year we can report a clear halt in this trend: the budget authority for FY 1972 is at the same level as the funds appropriated for FY 1971. The exact figure for FY 1972 is $3,271 billion. NASA would complete Apollo program with four previously planned missions but would delay Apollo 17 five months to ensure that mission carried experiments originally scheduled for canceled Apollo 18 and 19. Skylab missions would be delayed about four months, to follow as soon as practical after last Apollo flight. Plans for unmanned planetary exploration included two Mars orbiters in 1971, Jupiter flybys in 1972 and 1973, launch in 1973 for Venus-Mercury flyby in 1974, and two Viking launches in 1975 to land on Mars in 1976. Dr. Low said NASA had asked for $190 million for space shuttle in FY 1972. “We have included in our budget $100 million. This reduction means essentially that we will move out with the engine development exactly as we had planned; that we are still in a position to make a decision after we have completed the studies on the air frame development, whether to continue with additional design or whether to proceed with the development of the air frames.” Near-earth science programs included Orbiting Solar Observatories in 1971, 1973, 1974, and 1975 and last orbiting Astronomical Observatory in 1972. Space applications program would progress as planned, including two erts, two Nimbus experimental weather satellites, two Synchronous Weather Satellites, and two advanced communications experiments with ATS—F and ATS—G. New FY 1972 projects would include start of work on High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) and program for exploration of outer planets. “To do this we will develop a versatile new spacecraft, and we will plan Grand Tour missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-1977; and to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, in 1979.” NASA also would study mission to orbit Jupiter as alternative to first Grand Tour. Major new initiative in aeronautics in FY 1972 would be development of experimental stol aircraft. Downward trend in aerospace industry employment on NASA programs would be halted during FY 1972. “Although aerospace jobs will continue to decline in FY 1971, we expect employment to start increasing by the middle of FY 1972, with the end-of-year level being about equal to that at the beginning of the year.” NASA would reduce civil service work force by 1500 positions by end of FY 1972, bringing total decrease to 6800 since July 1967. Work on NERVA nuclear rocket engine would be limited to “essentially long-lead time items,” preserving ability “to move forward . . . when the need arises,” without large expenditures in FY 1972. Program included “no plans at this time for a manned Mars landing mission.” (Transcript)
U.S.S.R. launched Cosmos 390 from Baykonur into orbit with 270-km (167.8-mi) apogee, 202-km (125.5-mi) perigee, 89.2-min period, and 65.0° inclination. Satellite reentered Jan. 25. (gsfc SSR, 1/31/71; SBD, 1/13/71, 40)
London Sunday Express reported U.S.S.R. was building launching sites for intercontinental hydrogen bomb missiles at unprecedented speed in rocky areas. Paper said more them 60 silos had been photographed by spy satellites in recent months. U.K. Defence Ministry had said article was speculative, Reuters reported. (NYT, 1/11/71, 48) During October: nas published Plans for U.S. Participation in the GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment and Plan for U.S. Data Management in the Global Atmospheric Research Program. Reports of panels of ncr’s U.S. Committee for the Global Atmospheric Research Program called for increased preparation for major tropical observation experiment in Atlantic in summer 1974. Ad Hoc Tropical Task Group said experiment would require geostationary satellite “having both day and night imaging capability,” closely spaced array of ships with calibrated radar, upper-air wind-measuring systems, and from 10 to 12 aircraft. Garp Data Management Panel recommended international data management for project, with fulltime professionals appointed by U.S. and foreign atmospheric agencies. (Texts)
Lovell Lawrence, Jr., chief research engineer for Chrysler Corp. since 1964, died at age 55. Lawrence had been President of American Rocket Society, recipient of 1950 Goddard Memorial Lecture Award, President of Reaction Motors, Inc., and key figure in development of of USA Redstone ballistic missile. (NYT, 1/25/71, 39) Apogee kick motor was fired at 10:44 pm est, Jan. 26, about 11 hrs earlier than planned because of slight temperature fluctuations in apogee motor shaft. Intelsat-IV F—2 entered orbit with 36 410.4 km (22 624.4 mi) apogee, 35 740.0 km (22 207.8 mi) perigee, 1450-min period, and 0.59° inclination. Satellite would drift from position at 124° east longitude over Pacific to permanent station over Atlantic at 25.5° west longitude by about March 19. Intelsat-IV F—2 was first in Intelsat IV series of advanced comsats. Satellite—largest commercial comsat launched—was 5.4 m (17.6 ft) high with 237.5-cm (93.5-in) diameter and weighed 1397 kg (3080 lbs) at launch. It had 12 transponders, providing 12 TV channels and 3000-9000 telephone circuits, and was capable of multiple-access and simultaneous transmissions. Expected lifetime was seven years— two years more than Intelsat III comsats and over five years more than Intelsat /. (nasa Proj Off; ComSatCorp Release 71—4; Com-SatCorp pio)
Office of Management and Budget had released $98.1 million in FY 1972 funds voted for science education and institutional support, while impounding $30 million, Aviation Week & Space Technology noted. “The 25% holdback of funding at the basic science level is considered by some in Congress as highly destructive because it will tend to reduce the number of future scientists.” It was viewed as “direct contradiction of the pro-science policy they have been led to anticipate.” (Av Wk, 9/20/71, 15) Apollo 15 Astronaut David R. Scott told opening session that analysis of 2.7-m (9-ft) Apollo 15 lunar core sample had disclosed 58 distinct layers that represented 58 “chapters in the history of the sun.” Number of “pages in each chapter” awaited further analysis. Later Scott said in interview that Dr. Liaquat Husain, State Univ. of New York at Stony Brook scientist who had analyzed Apollo 15 “Genesis” rock, was concerned that alteration of rock by shock when it impacted with site at which it was found might have partly invalidated determination of rock’s age at 4.15 billion yrs. arc engineer John C. Arvesen described development of method for monitoring biological productivity from air by detecting signs of chlorophyll. Monitoring device, when tested over California lakes and offshore areas, had produced results that conformed closely to readings obtained by arduous direct sampling of waters. Ultimate goal was to develop satellite-borne system that could monitor global productivity of oceans. Dr. Charles A. Berry, nasa Director of Life Sciences, said newly completed studies of medical data from Apollo 14 had shown radiation exposure to crew that was more than twice that of previous Apollo missions. Primary reason for higher exposure was passage of Apollo 14 spacecraft close to Van Allen radiation belts. Dr. Berry said radiation dose was “of no hazard or biological significance.” Soviet scientists said later that cosmonauts carried special antiradiation drug on all space flights but had never used it. Dr. Berry said Apollo 14 Astronaut Stuart A. Roosa had lost 27% of fluid within his body cells during mission. His total body water had dropped 18% and red cells in his bloodstream had decreased 9%. Losses had been far less for other Apollo 14 astronauts and no such dramatic losses had been recorded for Apollo 15 astronauts, indicating that individual responses to space varied widely. Heavy loss of “exchangeable” potassium had been noted in astronauts during extended missions. On Apollo 15, loss had been as great as 15%. Potassium was deemed exchangeable because it could move readily in and out of tissues and thus could be purged from body. E. G. Johnson, Equipment and Facilities Branch Chief in NASA Space Nuclear Systems Office, described program for development of teleoperator systems in which remote-controlled devices could perform tasks in situations dangerous to health or safety of humans. In space, teleoperator could enter high radiation environment of space station’s nuclear power plant to change fuel elements or make repairs. Johnson said optical or radioastronomy observatory on moon’s far side could be run for 40 to 50 yrs using computer-controlled teleoperators whose control could be assumed from earth when necessary. Fourth International Orbital Laboratory Symposium was held during iaf congress. Sessions discussed earth resources technology and scientific research objectives and needs of developing countries in regard to earth resources research. iaa Fifth History of Astronautics Symposium on Sept. 23 was chaired by JPL Historian R. Cargill Hall. Soviet Cochairman V. N. Sokolsky did not attend for unexplained reason.

(Shabecoff, NYT, 5/25/71) May 24r-26: Eleventh European Space Symposium was held in West Berlin, Germany, to discuss applications satellites. In welcoming address Dr. Manfred Bodenschatz of German Society for Aviation and Astronautics (dglr) said: “We have passed through the infancy period of space flight and realized the untold possibilities of utilization. . . . It is only to be regretted that the general public has not apparently fully realized this and one does . . . begin to note a certain indifference to space flight accompanied by the feeling that the major space powers will be doing it for us anyway.” Purpose of symposium was “to demonstrate clearly that a whole range of . . . fields of application already exists and must be enlarged upon, and that European space technology, science, and industry can and must render its own important contribution here if it does not want to be left hopelessly behind.” (SF, 10/71, 393-4)
nas released Priorities for Space Research, 1971—1980. Report of study group of nas-nrc Space Science Board recommended priorities for nasa ossa programs at three funding levels for space missions in 1970s. Study was made at NASA’s request. Highest priorities were recommended for probes of Venus and Jupiter beginning in 1975; completion of three remaining Apollo manned lunar missions and unmanned landers and rovers for lunar and planetary studies; series of heao satellites for x-ray, gamma-ray, and cosmic-ray exploration; Small Astronomy Satellites (sas) ; increased astronomy rockets, balloons, and aircraft; development of mirror for Large Space Telescope (lst) ; continued study of earth-orbiting gyroscope and esro sunorbiting satellite for studies of gravitational physics in mid-1970’s; pair of satellites to study interaction between earth’s magnetosphere and solar wind and doubling of funds for solar-terrestrial physics; three satellite programs and increased data analysis for meteorology and earth resources surveys; and ground-based research to support Viking softlander and future exobiology missions. Report recommended next larger level of NASA funding provide for 1.5-m (60-in) space telescope, oso, and additional Atmospheric Explorers and Earth Resources Satellites. Grand Tour of planets between 1975 and 1980 was recommended only if nasa’s budget was increased still further. (nashvrc-nae News, 3/9/71)

Recent Soviet launches “indicate continued progress toward a system for inspecting and possibly destroying American satellites,” George C. Wilson reported in the Washington Post. Cosmos 400, target satellite launched March 19, was hunted by Cosmos 404, launched April 4, which “went through a series of maneuvers under propulsion supplied by the giant SS-9 rocket. . . . The Soviet Union has conducted such space marksmanship tests before . . . But this time the test showed more sophistication ... as the hunter satellite stayed in phase with the target for a longer period of time than on previous shots.” (W Post, 4/30/71, Al)

U.S.S.R. launched Mars 2 probe toward Mars from Baykonur at 9:23 pm local time (12:23 pm edt). At 10:59 pm Baykonur time (1:59 pm edt) spacecraft was injected into flight trajectory for Mars from “artificial earth satellite” in terrestrial orbit, according to Tass. Instruments were said to be working normally and flight was said to be close to calculated course. Primary objective of six-month, 470-million-km (292-million-mi) mission, Tass said, was to conduct complex research of Mars and its atmosphere and study characteristics of solar plasma, cosmic rays, and radiation along Mars route. Satellite was scheduled to reach Mars vicinity in November, when planet was 129 million km (80 million mi) from earth. Mars 2 was said to weigh 4650 kg (10 250 lbs)—almost five times weight of 1000-kg (2200-lb) Mariner-I scheduled for launch by nasa toward end of May. Size of Mars 2 had led U.S. space experts to predict that it might attempt Mars orbit. Mars 1, launched Nov. 1, 1962, had failed when radio contact was lost 106 million km (66 million mi) from earth. Zond 2, launched Nov. 30, 1964, had also ended in communication failure, (gsfc SSR, 5/31/71; SBD, 5/21/71, 112; Shabad, NYT, 5/20/71, 1; fbis-Sov-98-71, 5/20/71, LI; A&A, 1962; 1963; 1964)

(nasa Rpt SRl) arc team of scientists headed by Dr. Charles P. Sonett announced that first measurements of moon’s interior indicated moon had basaltlike mantle 338 km (210 mi) deep surrounding “cool core of primordial olivine-like rock.” Measurements suggested moon’s outer layer was melted during first billion years of its 4.5-billion-yr history. Measurements had been made with arc magnetometer placed on moon by Apollo 12 astronauts and also made by Explorer 35 moon-orbiting satellite launched July 19, 1967. (arc Release 71—2) Cornell Univ. astrophysicist Dr. Thomas Gold said stratifications found in Apollo 12 lunar surface samples were caused by earth in same process that made near side of moon different from far side. Moon passed behind earth with face turned earthward for four days during regular monthly cycle and was bombarded by high-energy electrons in earth’s magnetic field. Dr. Gold said he and coworkers had reproduced lunar surface markings inside vacuum chamber by bombarding finely ground earth material and small amounts of lunar soil with high-energy electrons up to 800 ev. Dr. Gold’s theory of “electrostatic motion” was disputed at meeting by Univ. of California physicist Dr. Harold C. Urey. (Lannan, W Star, 1/12/71, Al) NASA announced plan to continue lunar exploration with unmanned robots after last Apollo manned lunar landing in 1972. Plan would cost minimum $1 billion. Robot vehicles would travel 965 km (600 mi) across lunar surface and return to earth with samples or would rendezvous with other robot spacecraft that could return samples to earth. NASA spokesman said, “We sincerely hope that collaboration with the Russians takes place in space. A common program to explore the moon with instrumented spacecraft remotely controlled from earth might be the best way to help that collaboration take place.” (O’Toole, W Post, 1/14/71, Al)	_	_ Dr. Gerald R. Taylor, msc scientist, described laboratory experiment in which three highly resistant strains of bacteria were killed within 10 hrs of contact with one core sample from a number of centimeters below surface of moon’s Sea of Tranquility. Micro-organisms in protein soup had been exposed to lunar soil. Dr. Narenda Bhandari of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay, India, reported that analysis of cosmic ray tracks on moon had provided “conclusive proof” of existence in lunar soil of fossils from chemical elements far heavier than any previously discovered in nature or in laboratory. If verified, discovery would greatly extend periodic table of elements. (Wilford, NYT, 1/14/71, 9) Dr. P. Buford Price of Univ. of California at Berkeley, said during interview that Apollo 12 lunar samples might contain first real evidence of “magnetic monopoles,” basic force units that were to magnetism what electrons were to electricity. If their existence could be confirmed, it would mean rewriting books on magnetism and electrodynamics. Dr. Price’s group of scientists appeared to have found two fossil tracks of nuclear type of particles which, theoretically, could have been made by monopoles in two lunar cysts. (Lannan, W Star, 1/14/71, A3) Dr. Aleksander P. Vinogradov, Soviet academician and Director of Vernadsky Institute for Analytical Chemistry in Moscow, told conference U.S.S.R. would continue to explore moon with unmanned spacecraft and would attempt bolder missions in future. He believed U.S.S.R. would exchange lunar samples with U.S. beginning with samples of Sea of Fertility returned by Soviet Luna 16. He said main task for Lunokhod 1, Soviet moonwalker still on moon, was to determine how eight-wheeled vehicle could best move about moon and how it could best be used in future. “We discovered that the moonwalker can move in very large angles and can go down into craters at angles of 20 degrees. The mechanical qualities of this car are very good.” Dr. Vinogradov said Lunokhod 1 carried instrument to analyze soil, but device had not done so thus far. He described Luna l6 samples as bearing no evidence of water or life on moon. Drill used to dig samples had been stopped at 330 mm (13 in) below lunar surface because it hit rock. “We were afraid to send it any deeper.” Dr. Vinogradov described Sea of Fertility as “blackish powder” sprinkled with “cosmic beads.” Luna 16 sample was similar to soil brought back by Apollo 12 from Ocean of Storms and not very different from samples returned by Apollo 11 from Sea of Tranquility. Age of Sea of Fertility had been calculated at 4.6 billion yrs, older than some rocks returned by Apollo missions. (O’Toole, W Post, 1/15/71, Al) Dr. Paul W. Gast, chief of msc Earth and Lunar Sciences Div., reported discovery by msc scientists of “exotic components” in lunar soil believed to be fragments from primitive crust that covered moon 4.5	billion yrs ago. Fragments differed from other Apollo lunar samples and were thought to be pieces of crustal bedrock scattered by impact of meteorites pounding more ancient lunar highlands. Discovery, through chemical analysis, supported theory that moon once had hot, molten surface and that crust had hardened as it began cooling off. Discovery also helped explain why lunar soil was mostly one billion years older than lunar rocks. Dr. John A. Wood of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory described norite found in chemical analysis of five soil samples. Norite was lighter in color than most Apollo samples and did not appear to be chemically native to landing sites. Most norite represented “nearsurface material in an ancient lunar crust.” Coarser grained relative of norite might have come from “somewhat deeper in the moon— perhaps several miles.” If discovery proved true, samples would go back in age to beginnings of solar system. Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg—Cal Tech physicist who had dated Apollo 12 Sample 13, oldest rock yet found, at 4.5 billion yrs (other Apollo 12 rocks were about 3.4 billion yrs old)—said Sample 13’s oldest parts were granite that crystallized early in lunar history and could fie some of original crustal material and some of “magic component” that accounted for difference in ages of lunar rocks and soil. Dr. Wasserburg believed that fact there was always some missing ingredients in lunar soil meant soil contained debris from granites and other materials originating elsewhere on moon. Dr. Gary V. Latham, Apollo program chief seismic investigator, reported Apollo 12 seismometer was recording weak but frequent moon-quakes along rilles near landing site. He suggested rilles might be “fault zones,” where slight movements in lunar surface were occurring. (Wilford, NYT, 1/17/71, 4:7; Gast, msc)

Permanent charter for intelsat was signed by 54 nations—51 of whom were members of 80-member interim intelsat consortium—during State Dept, ceremonies. Signatures of three more original members were required for two-thirds majority necessary to inaugurate new agreement providing for gradual relaxation of U.S. control. Under permanent charter intelsat Assembly of Parties, prime organ of multitiered organization, would meet biennially and take decisions with one vote for each nation. Annual Meeting of Signatories would decide on financial, operational, and technical aspects of programs with one vote for each member, intelsat Board of Directors would meet at least four times a year to vote on design, development, construction, establishment, operation, and maintenance of space segment. No single Board member could cast more than 40% of total vote; decisions would be taken by two-thirds majority; and nonveto provisions had been written into charter. U.S. had agreed to relinquish unilateral veto power it had under interim arrangements. Permanent charter created new executive organ to assist Board of Governors, headed first by Secretary General and later by Director General. ComSatCorp would continue to provide technical and operational management of intelsat space segment under six-year contract. Net investment ceiling of U.S. $5 million was established with discretion in Board of Governors to increase ceiling by 10%.

NASA Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition Gerald M.	Truszynski testified on FY 1972 budget request during House Committee on Science and Astronautics authorization hearings. During 1970 otda supported some 50 ongoing scientific, applications, planetary, and lunar experiment missions as well as some 14 new flight projects launched in year by NASA and DOD. During Apollo 13 mission, with safe return after inflight explosion, MSFN “demonstrated that it is, in fact, the astronauts’ life-line to earth.” Valuable clues to origin of explosion were found in analysis of recorded telemetry data, msfn was still supporting experiments left on moon by Apollo 12 and 14 missions. After FY 1972’s Apollo 15 and 16 missions, network would be continuously monitoring 16 alsep experiments. Satellite network provided tracking and data acquisition for average monthly workload of some 40 earth-orbital satellites, including NASA’s scientific and applications satellites and projects of other Government agencies and foreign countries. dsn supported Mariner 6 and 7 probes in extended mission phase and Apollo 13, as well as four ongoing Pioneer missions (6 through 9). Data acquired by Goldstone antenna on effect of solar gravitation on Mariner spacecraft signals had verified Einstein theory of delay of 200 microseconds in return of signals from gravitational field of sun. Construction continued on second 64-m (210-ft) antenna at Tidbinbilla, Australia, and ground was broken for third near Madrid, Spain. (Transcript)

Astronauts could map 60% of lunar surface and place Nimbus weather satellite in lunar orbit to complete photography of entire moon in one year. (Hill, H Chron, 11/29/71)
New York Times editorial commented on nasa under new Administrator, Dr. James C. Fletcher: “The task of reversing nasa’s downhill course will not be easy, but there are grounds for believing that this period of doldrums can be overcome. It will help ... if the agency’s efforts in respect to Mariner 9 and Apollo 15 succeed as planned.” Two forces at work suggested “nasa may yet recapture some of the public support and interest which evaporated after its first spectacular Apollo flights to the moon’s surface. One is the capability of satellites to survey the earth with an efficiency never before known. . . . Beyond this there is the promising possibility of use of space research as a means of encouraging international cooperation. . . . over the next decade nasa may make its most important contribution as an instrument for demonstrating that men and women from many nations and many ideologies can work together for the benefit of all the earth.” (NYT, 5/21/71, 23)
U.S.S.R. was “showing signs of an accelerated effort” in space “stretching far beyond the implications of last month’s start on an orbiting space station,” Aviation Week & Space Technology said. “Latest analysis of orbital changes achieved by Cosmos 382, launched by a Proton booster . . . last fall . . . shows that the large unmanned satellite was moved once at an acceleration corresponding precisely to that required for lunar orbit insertion and once at exactly the velocity change needed for trans-earth injection.” (Av Wk, 5/3/71, 13)
Communist China’s technological progress was described by Bernard T. Feld in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: “The inescapable conclusion that the Chinese had mastered the difficult technologies of U—235 separation and hydrogen bomb production was somehow sublimated in the conviction that they would be much slower in mastering intercontinental ballistic missile technology. This conviction, advanced in the teeth of evidence—after all, the Chinese invented the rocket— was reinforced by reports of widespread technological disruption in the Cultural Revolution, Their two successful launchings of space satellites, the last one weighing around 480 pounds [218 kg], in March 1971, should have disabused even the most skeptical or prejudiced. In any case, there are a sufficient number of recent eyewitness accounts by Westerners of Chinese scientific achievements in various fields to dispell any notions of Chinese technical inferiority,” {Bull of Atomic Scientists, 9/71)
Launching of eight Soviet Cosmos satellites, Mars 2, and Mariner 9 had raised number of man-made objects in space to 2378, Reuters reported. Of total, little more them one fifth were satellites or payloads; remainder was space junk.

Study of telemetry from unsuccessful Europa 2 European launch vehicle that failed on launch Nov. 5 had shown vehicle buckled at lst-end stage junction 2 min 30 sec after liftoff during excessive pitch-over maneuver, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. Vehicle’s structural limits were exceeded; 2nd stage nozzle pierced liquid oxygen tank atop 1st stage, causing it to explode; 2nd stage separated in tumbling flight and exploded 10 sec later; and 3rd stage, 4th stage perigee motor, and payload fell into South Atlantic about 490 km (305 mi) downrange. Failure had been attributed to loss of inertial-guidance-system signals between 1 min 45 sec and 1 min 47 sec after launch. Engines on 1st stage had driven Europa 2 below programmed trajectory because corrective signals had not been sent to stage’s autopilot. Exact cause of inertial-guidance-system breakdown had not been determined. If cause could not be established before Dec. 15, launch of 12th satellite in Europa 1-2 development series—scheduled for April 13, 1972—would have to be delayed. (Av Wk, 11/22/71, 19)

New York Times commented on orbiting of second Communist Chinese satellite: It had provided “impressive evidence of the advance of Communist China in war-related technology. It hardly needs underlining that a rocket capable of orbiting a sputnik could also deliver a hydrogen bomb to a distant target on earlji.” It was evident that “Mao Tse-tung has been trying to insulate a small group of scientists and their activity in weapons development from the general turmoil of the cultural revolution as well as from the inadequate supply of practically everything in normal Chinese economic life. That effort has apparently been successful.” (NYT, 3/11/71, 38)

It had orbited earth more than 50 000 times and traveled more than 2.4 billion km (1.5 billion mi), (aec Release 0-103; A&A, 1961)
Aerobee 170 sounding rocket was launched by NASA from wsmr carrying gsfc stellar spectra experiment. Mission was unsuccessful. (SR list) October 28: U.K. successfully launched 66-kg (145-lb) Prospero (X-3), its first technology satellite, from Woomera Test Range, Australia, on Black Arrow booster. U.K. thus became sixth nation to launch its own satellite with its own launch vehicle. Prospero entered orbit with 1540-km (956.9-mi) apogee, 552-km (343-mi) perigee, 106.4-min period, and 82° inclination. Satellite, developed for $28.8 million in six years, carried experiments to test satellite technology. Prospero was first and last U.K. satellite scheduled for launch on U.K. booster. X—4, scheduled for launch in early 1974, would be launched by NASA Scout booster. (gsfc SSR, 10/31/71; SBD, 11/2/71, 14; Owen, KC Times, 11/26/71)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, reviewed nasa program before 25th annual conference of aiaa Board of Governors in Williamsburg, Va.: “This country needs space programs that move out vigorously to create new technology. A space effort that limps along on yesterday’s knowhow will not do much for the country. A slow program may cost less, but be worth nothing in terms of meeting the country’s needs. And a slow program—or no program—is all we are going to have without the strong support of the public. ... We should invent and fly more self-supporting satellites. We are seeking and getting valuable scientific knowledge from space we could not get in any other way . . . about the Earth and its atmosphere, the sun and the planets, and the universe. And about man himself.” National security was at stake. “It would not be safe for the United States, with its great responsibilities for world peace, to lag behind any other country in space technology. This is an axiom we did not quibble about in the ’60s and should not quibble about in the ’70s.” Space program had proved “excellent hotbed for forcing new technology, which in turn raises our national productivity and prosperity and increases our ability to solve pressing social problems of today’s urban society.” Finally, space exploration was needed as inspiration for modern man. “I think we are inspired, and our children are inspired, to be living in an age when man first moved out into space and began the exploration of our solar system. I think we should be ashamed of ourselves, as a society, if we withdrew from space exploration now after such an auspicious beginning.” (Text)
National Geographic Society was quoted in Chicago Tribune as saying, Phobos, Martian satellite, was darkest body yet observed in solar system, “possibly because meteoroids had scoured it clean of reflecting dust.” (C Trib, 11/5/71)
Failure Review Board appointed to study malfunction of Delta 85 and Delta 86 launch vehicles had completed report, nasa announced. Failure of Delta 86, which had failed to orbit itos-b Oct. 21, had apparently been caused by leak in oxidizer system’s vent valve, which caused 2nd stage to move from correct attitude. To compensate for disturbance, attitude thrusters using stored nitrogen gas fired continuously to keep rocket properly oriented, depleting nitrogen gas and causing rocket to tumble and erashland after reignition. Apparent cause of Delta 85 malfunction while orbiting Oso 7 Sept. 29 had been nitrogen gas leak in 2nd-stage hydraulic reservoir system. Although control of spacecraft had been lost before spacecraft separation, satellite had entered slightly elliptical orbit and had accomplished its mission objectives, (nasa Release 71-253)
Peking Radio announced that Communist China’s second satellite, launched March 3, was transmitting scientific data in “whistles, pips, bleeps, and blurrs.” Announcement broke two-week silence on launching of satellite. New China News Agency said satellite weighed 220.5	kg (486 lbs) and was in elliptical orbit. (Reuters, W Post, 3/17/71, A12)
Defeat of sst program and “widespread public antipathy toward technology” had “encouraged the political liberals to intensify their attack on defense spending and press for a larger welfare budget,” Robert Hotz said in Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial. “The Air Force B—1 supersonic bomber program will inherit all the supersonic transport’s onus since it has basically the same flight characteristics.” (Av Wk, 5/3/71, 9) systems. Workshop was sponsored by nasa, Dept, of Agriculture, noaa, U.S. Geological Survey, usn Naval Oceanographic Office, aid, and Dept, of State. Ambassador George H. W. Bush, U.S. Representative to U.N., in welcoming address called space technology a global tool and said, “for a global tool to be used productively and efficiently, there must be a climate of international cooperation.” Workshop and U.N. could “provide policy makers and program managers in developing countries with the basic information to enable them to consider seriously how this new technology may help them meet their needs.” Dr. William T. Pecora, Under Secretary of the Interior, said in keynote address that earth-surveying satellites were “must” for world’s welfare. “Whether or not our great population can avoid intolerable social problems of a crowded world and maintain the hoped-for living standards is a matter of conjecture, but our ability to survive will depend in large part on critical assessment of all the earth’s resources.” Leonard Jaffe, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications, described nasa Earth Resources Aircraft Program (erap) : “Instead of waiting for data acquired from spacecraft, users are presently obtaining multispectral data of Earth phenomena from sensors carried by NASA aircraft ... to evaluate the sensors and to develop a solid foundation for observational and interpretive techniques for earth-resources space missions.” erap included RB-57F, P-3A, and C-130B aircraft. “We shall shortly add two more high altitude (U-2) aircraft.” Lockheed C-130B was flying optical and infrared laboratory with 24-channel multispectral scanner to provide information on signatures used to separate, classify, and identify specific earth resources. “This is an expansion of the 12-channel scanner of the University of Michigan C-^47 aircraft which we also use for the same purposes. The P—3A or Electra is our radio-wave instrument development laboratory.” Radio antennas on underside of aircraft were used heavily for oceanographic and hydrological studies. Since remotely sensed data had to be verified with actual ground data, “complementary ground efforts are necessary during the research phase of the program.” In spacecraft program to begin in 1972, “erts satellites will be placed into a 920-kilometer [570-mi], sun-synchronous (near polar) orbit. This will permit the satellite, with its narrow-angle sensors, to observe the same spot on Earth once every 18 days. It also ensures that observations are made with a nearly constant solar-illumination angle required for developing identification signatures. The altitude permits narrow-angle sensors to be used to obtain virtually undistorted images.” (nasa Release 71—74; GE Challenge, Summer 1971; Transcript)

Uhuru (Explorer 42) Small Astronomy Satellite—launched Dec. 12, 1970—was adjudged successful by NASA. Satellite had completed full systematic scanning of galactic plane and substantially complete scan (95%) of celestial sphere. Experiment instrumentation was functioning in outstanding manner, exceeding many design objectives. Spacecraft control section performance—except for tape recorder and slight decrease in telemetry modulation, which had not affected data quality—was excellent. Acquired scientific data had touched on every aspect of observational x-ray astronomy and significant unexpected phenomena had been observed. Discovery of three new x-ray pulsars—■ Cygnus X—1, Centaurus X—3, and Lupus X-l—revealed class of pulsating x-ray source that differed in many respects from previously known x-ray pulsar in Crab Nebula, (nasa Proj Off)
President Nixon transmitted to Congress World Weather Program, Plan for Fiscal Year 1972. Report described significant activities of program and planned participation of Federal agencies. In message of transmission President said: “Satellite technology is being used with increasing effectiveness to gather global information for earlier, more accurate predictions and warnings of hazardous weather. New stations are being established for long-term measurement of atmospheric change. Computers have been programmed to determine the effect of pollution upon the atmosphere. A major international experiment in the Atlantic Ocean is being prepared under the Global Atmospheric Research Program. During the past year many nations, including the United States, have indicated their support of this tropical experiment and have made tentative commitments to provide ships, aircraft, satellites, and other observing facilities. Linked with an increased computer capability to assess and integrate results, this experiment should be an important step toward attaining a true understanding of the global atmosphere.” (PD, 4/19/71, 630)

U.S. patent No. 3 608 844, for self-deploying arm to serve as spacecraft boom or antenna, was granted to GSFC engineers William T. Tumulty, Jr., and Wayne P. Sours. Called Minimech, device could also retrieve objects from burning building, serve as escape chute, or erect itself as instant tent pole or instant plumbing. It could be made from various materials depending on purpose. (NYT, 10/2/71; Pat Off pio) Tetr 3 (tetr-d) Test and Training Satellite, carried pickaback on Delta 2nd stage, was ejected into orbit with 571-km (354.8-mi) apogee, 391-km (243-mi) perigee, 94.3-min period, and 33.0° inclination. Primary objective of 45-lb (20.4-kg) secondary payload was to test Manned Space Flight Network and train msfn personnel. Second-stage anomaly of launch vehicle separated spacecraft at pitch angle outside normal sun acquisition limits. For eight hours following orbital insertion, ground controllers manually commanded spacecraft to despin. Pitch angle was then changed to place it within automatic acquisition range. Sail section was commanded to acquisition mode and sail acquired and locked onto sun at approximately 2:00 pin edt. Batteries were then charged. Orbit would permit observations for more than a year. Oso 7, improved over earlier osos, provided for increase in experiment size and weight and power and extended capability in pointed mode, including stability and pointing during night portion of orbit. It was spin-stabilized; weighed 636 kg (1403 lbs); carried six scientific experiments; and had two main sections—wheel (lower), which carried nondirectional scanning experiments and basic support equipment, and sail (upper), which carried pointed experiments. Experiments, designed to continue and extend work of preceding oso spacecraft, were provided by gsfc, nrl, mit, Univ. of New Hampshire, and Univ. of California (San Diego). Oso 7 was 8th in series of 11 OSO spacecraft designed to provide direct observations of sun during most of 11-yr solar cycle. Oso 1 (launched March 7, 1962) and Oso 2 (launched Feb. 3, 1965) had passed their six-month lifetimes and together provided more than 8600 hours of scientific information, oso-c (launched Aug. 25, 1968) had failed to reach orbit when booster malfunctioned. Oso 3 (launched Mar. 8, 1967) and Oso 4 (launched Oct. 18, 1967) transmitted on command only. Oso 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1969) had both tape recorders and seven of eight experiments operating satisfactorily after six months in orbit. Oso 6 (launched Aug. 9, 1969) was relaying information from all seven experiments. OSO program was managed by gsfc under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 71-163; Spacetvam, 10/5/71)

By 10 pm Moscow time (3 pm edt), Mars 2 was 2 495 000 km (1 550 000 mi) from earth and Mars 3 was 44 000 km (27 000 mi), Tass reported. Each satellite weighed 4650 kg (10 250 lbs) and had as prime mission objective complex research of Mars and its atmosphere. Tass said that Mars 3 carried instrumentation for exploration of Mars and neighboring space, for investigating solar radio emission in one-meter wave band in experiment developed and manufactured by French specialists in French-Soviet cooperative program, and for measuring characteristics of solar plasma and cosmic rays, (fbis—Sov— 71-104, 6/1/71, LI; SBD, 6/2/71, 69; Shabad, NYT, 5/29/71, 1)
International aspects of U.S. space program were discussed by Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, in luncheon speech before National Space Club in Washington, D.C.: Cooperation with Western nations in past decade had included 70 countries, 250 specific agreements, and more than 24 joint satellite projects at run-out cost in excess of $400 million. More than 50% of total had been funded by other nations. In 1970s, “opportunities exist for cooperation on a significantly larger scale.” U.S. wished “to build a foundation for important benefit- and cost-sharing in the major space programs of the future.” Canada, Japan, and Australia—“countries having the most obvious potential for post-Apollo work-sharing”—had been given “every chance to become fully acquainted with our plans and studies” to enable them to decide whether they wished to commit their own resources. European Space Conference had put several million dollars into studies of post-Apollo program possibilities and some member countries had invested still larger amounts. British, French, and West German firms were working with NASA prime contractors on space shuttle design studies. Europe would have to choose between significant participation in shuttle funding and funding independent European rocket program. Decision would be necessary “even if Europe funds only 10 per cent of the shuttle’s price tab.” U.S. had said it would “sell launch services for projects consistent with peaceful purposes and existing international agreements . . . [and] that general technical access to the entire program would be available, but that technology at the level of commercial know-how would be transferred in either direction only where one side required it to complete its commitments to the other.” Since Europe was talking of only 10% share of shuttle program, “we said that we would retain decision-making responsibility except where European costs were directly affected, in which case decisions would be joint.” In U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space, “it is particularly important that we give clear recognition to both . . . competition and cooperation.” U.S. was competing with U.S.S.R. “because accomplishments in space represent a measure of the state of our technology; and in today’s world, the level of our technology is of first importance, strategically, economically, and politically.” U.S. was cooperating with U.S.S.R. “because we both live in a vast universe that must be explored, where important new knowledge is to be gained, for the benefit of all men, everywhere.” While U.S. retained demonstrated lead over U.S.S.R., “it will not be an enduring lead without major new initiatives on our part— initiatives like the space shuttle and the exploration of the outer planets. . . .” In Jan. 18—21 Moscow talks with Soviet Academy of Sciences, “we specifically agreed, initially, to exchange three grams [0.11 oz] of sample obtained from Luna 16, for three grams each from Apollo 11 and 12. These relatively small amounts are sufficient for detailed scientific examination of a comparative nature.” Additional meetings on compatible docking arrangements had not been held because “docking discussions are well underway, and the planned exchange of information is taking place.” On visit to Soviet cosmonaut training area at Star City, “we were welcomed by Cosmonauts Beregovoy, Nikolayev, Leonov, Shatalov, and Valentina Tereshkova. We were shown the Soyuz mission trainer, and were invited to attempt to dock two Soyuz spacecraft in their docking trainer. While there, I also presented a plaque in memory of Yuri Gagarin [first man in space] from the U.S. astronauts.” (Text) • President Nixon announced appointments of members of President’s Science Advisory Committee for terms expiring Dec. 31, 1974: Dr. Lee A.

Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences continued hearings on nasa FY 1972 authorization. Roy P. Jackson, nasa Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, testified that LeRC quiet engine program was proceeding on schedule: “Tests of full-scale fans for the engine have revealed much new information von the interrelationships among noise, aerodynamic performance, and structural integrity. The complete experimental engine will be operated in about 6 months. Results . . . indicate that we may expect to better the original noise abatement goals. Program results are given to industry on a continuing basis. . . . We can expect some of our improvements to be adopted by industry in new engine designs before completion of our program.” nasa—aec Space Nuclear Systems Office Manager Milton Klein said: “Reactor power sources will be required to provide power in amounts greater than a few kilowatts for many of the missions of the future. For unmanned military satellites, radiation hardening—mandatory for certain military missions—and low recurring costs for multiple missions are important advantages of small reactor systems. For unmanned NASA earth orbit missions, reactors become cost effective above a few kilowatts, a power range needed for such applications missions as communications satellites. In manned missions . . . overriding advantage of reactor systems is their ability to accommodate unforeseen large increases in power demand.” Advanced reactor systems “are needed for electric propulsion systems capable of high energy missions ... to the far planets.” Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition Gerald M. Truszynski reported that satellite network included “ten electronic ground stations . . . operated by NASA, which are supplemented by an optical tracking network operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. The electronic stations provide a worldwide system which . . . tracks each satellite, . . . determines the status of onboard systems, . . . commands the satellite’s functions, and . . . acquires stored or real-time data from the satellite. The optical stations, which include laser capabilities at selected sites, provide specialized services in precision orbital tracking.” (Transcript)
itos-b Improved Tiros Operational Satellite failed to reach orbit after 4:32 am pdt launch by nasa for noaa from WTR on two-stage long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta (DSV—N—6) booster. Satellite, weighing 306 kg (675 lbs), had been intended for sun-synchronous orbit to make regular, dependable, day and night cloud-cover observations by both direct readout and onboard storage. Flight appeared normal through Delta first burn. At start of last period (approximately one hour coast), pitch and yaw altitude-control jets began pulsating to counteract unknown force tending to tumble vehicle. Pitch and yaw jets were able to maintain vehicle in proper altitude until gas was expended. At that time, unknown force caused vehicle to tumble. Planned vehicle functions remaining, including second Delta burn and spacecraft separation, occurred approximately on time. Planned circular orbit was not achieved and spacecraft and Delta 2nd stage impacted above Arctic Circle. Review board was being formed to investigate Delta 2nd-stage failure. ITOS-B was second Tiros spacecraft funded by NOAA and third spacecraft in ITOS series. First, Itos 1 (Tiros-M), had been launched Jan. 23, 1970. Second, Noaa 1 (itos-a), was launched Dec. 11, 1970, and ceased operations Aug. 19, 1971. Office of Space Science and Applications had overall responsibility for mission, with Earth Observations Program Office managing project for Headquarters.

U.S.S.R. had again tested “hunter” satellites, designed to locate and destroy other satellites, George C. Wilson reported in the Washington Post. Cosmos 394 (launched Feb. 9) had entered circular orbit and had been intercepted by Cosmos 397 (launched Feb. 25), he said. Satellites’ inclination suggested launches were from Plesetsk rather than Tyuratum [ Baykonur] and “probably means that the Soviet Union considers its satellite inspection system in the operational rather than experimental category.” (WPost, 3/9/71, A3)
perigee, 469-min period, and 3.57° inclination. Primary objective was to measure characteristics and formation of earth’s ring current and development of main-phase magnetic storms; relation between magnetic storms, aurora, and acceleration of particles within inner magnetosphere; and relative importance of various diffusion mechanisms in populating radiation zones at 4- to 5-earth-radii elliptical equatorial orbit. By Nov. 29 all satellite household functions were nominal but spacecraft was coning at higher angle than planned, which would make data reduction slightly more difficult. Attempts were being made to reduce coning angle. Five experiments had been turned on and were operating satisfactorily. One experiment, charged particle detector, remained to be turned on.

Benefits of U.S.—U.S.S.R. cooperation in space under agreements signed by NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences in October 1970 and January 1971 were described by Arnold W. Frutkin, nasa Assistant Administrator for International Affairs, during testimony before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on International Cooperation in Science and Space: “If a cautious optimism proves justified, we can expect definite benefits. Each side will gain access to lunar materials from sites additional to those it had explored on its own. We will nearly double the coverage of our operational meteorological satellites. We shall have created a global network for sounding rocket observations of basic importance to world meteorological research. We shall have demonstrated a mutual participation in earth resources survey work. We can greatly expand our knowledge of the behavior of man in flight through data on Soviet missions in addition to our own. We shall make it possible to avoid any undesirable duplication of scientific work in space, to plan complementary missions, and to verify anomalous results—all helping us to develop opportunities for more rational and economic conduct of space science and exploration.” Successful performance of rendezvous and docking agreement “will give us greater flexibility in space emergencies and for joint activities in space which could go a long way toward reducing international tensions and demonstrating common human interest.” (Testimony)

Tenth anniversary of U.S.S.R.’s Vostok 1, first manned space flight, piloted by Cosmonaut Yuri A. Gagarin. Anniversary was celebrated in Moscow with 6000 guests attending memorial meeting in Kremlin’s Palace of Congresses and with Soviet newspapers filled with articles commemorating Sight. At Moscow ceremony Mstislav V. Keldysh, President of Soviet Academy of Sciences, said U.S.S.R. was looking forward to time “when man will make interplanetary flights. Tremendous potentialities in the study of the earth’s natural satellite were uncovered by the flights of American astronauts to the moon and the development in our own country of new types of automatic lunar stations.” Successful operation of U.S.S.R.’s Lunokhod 1 lunar rover represented start of new era envisioned by Soviet scientists, Keldysh said. U.S.S.R. would emphasize unmanned flights with particular stress on long-term orbiting space stations. Cosmonaut Andrian G. Nikolayev told meeting U.S.S.R.’s 1971-1975 economic plans called for 1‘fundamental development of scientific research, with a significant role foT lunar and solar investigation.”

Sonic booms from usaf jets had smashed prehistoric ruins and caused disintegration of cliff faces at Yellowstone and Teton National Parks, Director of National Park Service George B. Hartzog said in testimony before House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Department of the Interior and Related Agencies. He believed jets originated in California but had received no meaningful response from correspondence with usaf. (Testimony) Dr. Frederick Seitz, former nas President, paid tribute to Dr. Dryden at opening session: “I am particularly pleased that these remarks can be made . . . following several successful lunar manned missions. In a sense, Dr. Dryden’s professional life was directed as by fate to the scientific and technological watershed represented by a successful Apollo program. Today we stand beyond that watershed and are privileged to inspect new vistas.” Dr. Dryden had become “perhaps the centred figure” in U.S. transition to space age following 1957 launch by U.S.S.R. of first successful Sputnik. He had helped prepare legislation to establish NASA. “In this process, he . . . drew upon his creative genius in helping to devise an administrative and operational instrument which would make flexible use of the existing and potential resources of our country and at the same time, focus, in a relentlessly systematic way, upon well-defined missions. Many individuals have contributed to the success of our space program, but none have been more crucial than Hugh Dryden working at his broadest as the scientist, the administrator, and the visionary.” Dr. Seitz estimated Dryden Memorial Fund contribution to auditorium’s construction represented nearly 40% of total cost. Following Dr. Seitz’ remarks, bust of Dr. Dryden presented to NAS by National Space Club was unveiled. At business session, nas announced decision to increase membership to include leaders in medical, social, and behavioral research. Limit of 50 new members elected annually would be raised to 75 in 1972 and 100 .in 1973. Thereafter limit would be reduced over several years to 60. (nas-nrc-nae News Rpt, 3/71, 1; Text; NASA Special Ann; Program; Schmeck, NYT, 4/28/71, 3:32) Dr. Gary V. Latham, chief Apollo program seismologist, said most quakes shaking two Apollo seismometers left on moon appeared to be coming from one place that could be 644 km (400 mi) below lunar surface. Dr. Latham guessed quakes were result of molten rock being moved about under moon by tidal forces on earth. Larger quakes were too deep to be caused by escaping gas, which led to his theory that sublunar volcano caused quakes. He was unable to pinpoint quake source, except that they emanated from somewhere along 1290-km (800-mi) line between seismometers left on moon by Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 astronauts. (O’Toole, W Post, 4/27/71, A3) Discovery by Uhuru (Explorer 42) Small Astronomy Satellite (launched Dec. 12, 1970) of slowdown in spin rate of x-ray star Centaurus X—3 in Milky Way Galaxy was reported by Dr. Riccardo Giacconi and Dr. Wallace Tucker of American Science and Engineering, Inc. Change, deduced April 12 from star’s pulsation’s, was caused, scientists thought, by some violent event, such as vast in-fall of material onto star. (Sullivan, AIT, 4/29/71, 52) Possible first interception of solar neutrinos—“ghost” particles that sped earthward from sun’s core—was described by Dr. Raymond Davis, Jr., of Brookhaven’s National Laboratory. Using tank containing cleaning fluid 1.6 km (1 mi) underground in gold mine in South Dakota, Dr. Davis was detecting average of one solar neutrino every third day. Detection was difficult because neutrinos had no electric charge and floated freely through atom unless they hit its nucleus squarely. If Dr. Davis’ observations were confirmed, they would contribute to understanding of how sun produced energy. Neutrinos were thought to be largely produced by reactions that began with fusion of two hydrogen nuclei (protons). (Sullivan, NYT, 4/30/71, 3:23) Dr. V. Paul Kenney of Notre Dame Univ. told press briefing that “every 20 years or so we get a 1000 fold increase in the energy of onr accelerators and each time we enter a new era of physics.” (Lannan, W Star, 4/30/71, Aid)

Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering, testified on dod space activities during authorization hearings before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: dod space funding program for FY 1972 called for $1552.6 million, slightly under the $1553.1 million of FY 1971. “The design and fabrication of a new set of satellites intended to replace the interim Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs) will be completed in 1971. These satellites, to be launched next month, have significantly higher power and greater bandwidth than their predecessors, and each is equipped with a versatile set of antennas capable of serving fixed and transportable users dispersed over large areas of the earth. Among these are steerable antennas which can be oriented to satisfy contingency needs in changing global situations. To exploit the potential of this new system, we will need better surface terminal equipment. Accordingly, we intend to continue the intensive development of new reliable terminals and modulation and antijamming equipment.” In FY 1972, dod expected “to start developing a satellite communications system that operates in the military ultra-high-frequency (uhf ) hand and is tailored to the characteristics of the mobile users. When deployed, this system should allow us to retire much of our hf radio equipment.” Use of navigational satellites “has the potential of attaining a continuous, highly accurate worldwide position-fixing system. That system could support many ground, sea, airborne and space applications.” In FY 1972, dod planned “to undertake system definition and design studies of the next-generation Defense Navigation Satellite System (dnss).” Under Doppler Geodetic Satellite Program coordinated by Defense Intelligence Agency, geodetic Doppler receivers would observe USN navigation and other Doppler-equipped satellites. Program would provide worldwide geodetic data. dod proposed “to continue a small effort in FY 1972 to develop propulsion technology for high-energy orbit-to-orbit stages that will be compatible with the shuttle system, with a view to future space maneuvering missions projected for the late 1970’s and early 1980’s.” (Transcript)
