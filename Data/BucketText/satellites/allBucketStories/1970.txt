Although Communist China officially had entered space age with April 24 launch of satellite, milch of the country’s industrial machinery was “product of an earlier age,” New York Times said. Workers at Shanghai factories had said they “used the equipment of the twenties to turn out products of the seventies.” While Communist China’s space success reflected “application of a more advanced technology,” even this was said to have been achieved “because the Chinese people adhered to the ‘principle of independence and selfreliance.’ ” (NYT, 5/3/70,18)

Christian Science Monitor editorial: “China’s successful orbiting of her first satellite is further proof of her continuing effort in space and rocketry—even if her entering of the space age comes nearly 13 years after Sputnik I. It is proof, too, that even if China still lacks industrial brawn and remains basically an underdeveloped country, she is not lacking in scientific and technical brilliance. What she has achieved is all the more remarkable because—as the Chinese themselves report it—the Soviet Union reneged in 1959 on its 1957 agreement to help China with ‘new technology for nuclear defense.’ Thus what China has done has been done on her own—and by her scientists and technologists in spite of the self-inflicted torment of Chairman Mao’s cultural revolution.” (CSM, 4/29/70)

NASA’s oao-b Orbiting Astronomical Observatory failed to reach orbit after launch from etr by Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle at 5:40 pm est, apparently because nose-fairing failed to separate from vehicle. Additional weight of nose fairing prevented Centaur from reaching necessary orbital velocity and satellite impacted shortly after completion of Centaur burn. Failure investigation board would be established by LaRC. Primary objective of OAO-B was to obtain moderate resolution spectrophotometric data in uv bands between 1100 and 4000 A to investigate photometry of peculiar stars, law of interstellar reddening, magnitude and intensity of Lyman-alpha red shift for nearby galaxies, spectra of emission and reflection nebulas, and spectral energy distribution of normal stars, galaxies, and intergalactic media. OAO-B at 2123 kg (4680 lbs) was largest U.S. satellite to date and carried world’s largest telescope—914-mm (36-in) Goddard experiment package—which could make detailed measurements and observations previously unobtainable in space astronomy, oao-b was third in series of four observatories planned by NASA. Oao II, launched Dec. 7,1968, was still operating satisfactorily, (nasa Release 70-174; nasa Proj Off)
Science editorial commented on comsats: The communications satellites have a variety of applications. . . . One application that will probably be implemented fairly soon is aeronautical and ship communication. Radio works well on line of sight but is undependable at distances greater than 300 miles [483 km]. Many ships have been lost while radio operators were trying in vain to communicate their peril. Midocean aeronautical navigation represents another growing need which could also be filled. Satellite enthusiasts point to other potential uses. One of these is Picturephone, which now requires about 100 telephone circuits for a single two-way conversation. High-capacity; low-cost satellite circuits would help to make feasible large-scale use of this device. Perhaps more distant but of great consequence would be exploitation of future inexpensive communications for use in educational television. Constructive applications of satellites are now a reality, and extension of technological potentials will have profound and global consequences.” (Science, 11/20/70)

AP quoted Soviet geophysicist Sergey Timofeyev as saying Europe had entered period of colder summers and winters because moon was closer to earth than usual. Situation created “atmosphere tide” that disturbed normal movements of warm and cool air. (NYT, 5/20/ 70) Among 32 NASA officials and scientists attending meeting were Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator; Gerald M. Truszynski, Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition; and Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong. Armstrong received tumultuous welcome from predominantly Russian audience, AP reported. During question-and-answer period before his report, Armstrong said that when he viewed earth from moon, “I thought it was impossible that a little island like that in the sky could have so many problems on it.” He had found it “more pleasant on the moon than on earth as far as gravity is concerned.” In report on experiences on moon, Armstrong said, “Since the sky is black the impression is somewhat like being on a sandy athletic field at night that is very well illuminated with flood lights.” Further improvement in mobility of pressure garments would improve ability of astronauts to carry out lunar experiments. At later session when Armstrong attended as observer, guards had difficulty restraining cheers of audience, which included 800 Soviet delegates and 420 representatives of 30 countries. AP said it was “dramatic and unusual” tribute to foreign visitors in U.S.S.R. Dr. Leonard D. Jaffe, JPL scientist, reported to COSPAR meeting on study and comparison of 60 Surveyor photos taken in April 1967 and 20 Apollo 12 photos that showed moon’s extreme stillness. Photos indicated only one small pebble had moved during 31 mos at Surveyor III site. Rate of meteoroid impact or surface movement was low in area of Ocean of Storms where Apollo 12 and Surveyor III had landed. Camera and several portions of Surveyor spacecraft had coating of One dust stirred from lunar surface as Apollo 12 LM descended nearby. Only other change observed in Surveyor was that its white paint had turned to tan, “partly due to deposition of material on the spacecraft.” nas-nrc submitted United States Space Science Program, comprehensive summary of scientific research in space science in U.S. during 1969: “Popular interest in the space program, which reached a high point with the first successful lunar landing, has diminished somewhat. Furthermore, a reassessment of national priorities has resulted in reduced financial support for space research and technology during the past year, and the support will probably be even more limited this year and next. It is our intention, despite these limitations, to try to maintain a reasonably balanced program, with continuing effort in all areas of space research in which we are currently engaged and to support mutually advantageous international cooperation in space research wherever possible.” (Text) Soviet academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov told meeting U.S.S.R. would launch two French sret earth resources satellites as part of 1966 French-Soviet agreement on scientific cooperation. French Roseau (Radio Observation par Satellite Excentrique a Automatisme Unique) program, with multisatellite payload to be launched in 1971-1972, had been postponed because of budgetary restrictions and sret (Satellite de Recherches et d’Environment Technique) had been retained. Joint French-Soviet space program also included plans for emplacement of French laser reflector on lunar surface by Soviet Luna spacecraft; stero, launching of French experiments for measurement of solar radio emission; and arcade, study of solar energy particles with French and Soviet equipment on board Soviet spacecraft.

Aerospace Defense Command reported that U.S. had 290 satellites in orbit around earth at end of January, with 18 deep-space probes still active. U.S.S.R. had 75 satellites and 14 deep-space probes. U.K. had 3, France 5, Canada 3, West Germany 1, Australia 1, and esro 3. (SD Union, 2/8/70) During January: Space/Aeronautics reviewed status of aerospace and aeronautical projects at commencement of 1970s. Commercial transport industry was “microcosm of the capitalistic system. The health of any constituent, sst or airbus or Stol, is on trial in a harshly profit-motivated atmosphere that says. .. ‘shape up or ship out.’ Nowhere is this test more evident than in the troubled, hesitant posture of the U.S. SST program.” With retrenchment to fixed-wing design “and a continual dropback in the urgency level of our SST effort,” sst’s competitive advantages were “being dissipated by an inexorable calendar.” Apollo 11 lunar landing had alleviated Congressional opposition to further expensive long-term space commitments. “Suddenly, it was practical to think of going ahead with an expanded lunar exploration program.” Space science and applications program had been marking time, “with most programs stretched out to match the diminished funding made smaller still by the nasty bite of inflation.” But “light is beginning to show at the end of the long, dark tunnel of fiscal retrenchment.” Success of satellite infrared spectrometer (sirs), “welcome and long overdue test of ATS-3” for coast-to-coast relay of TV programs, and climb in “Comsat’s ’69 operating profiles” above Si-million mark had led space science program steadily to shift “its dollar focus away from the earth.” Civil systems activity by aerospace community was only token. “Yet 1969 may prove to have been a landmark year for the industry’s relations with this strange and often self-contradictory market. New initiatives by the federal government indicate a growing awareness in Washington of what aerospace may be able to contribute to the solution of complex civil problems.” (S/A, 1/70, 27-69, 81-132)

Nimbus IV (Nimbus-D) meteorological satellite was successfully launched by NASA from wtr by long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor (THORAD)-Agena D booster. Launch was 400th for USAF’S Thor booster. Satellite entered orbit with 1098.0-km (682.4-mi) apogee, 1087.2-km (675.7-mi) perigee, 107.1-min period, and 99.9° inclination. USA’s Topo I first in new series of topographic satellites to be used with equipment modified from USA’s SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) program, was carried as secondary payload on Agena D 2nd stage. Topo I was ejected into orbit with 1092-km (678.5-mi) apogee, 1085-km (674.2-mi) perigee, 107-min period, and 99.8° inclination, where it would investigate new technique for accurate, real-time determination of positions on earth’s surface. Primary objectives for Nimbus IV were to acquire sufficient number of global samples of atmospheric radiation measurements for comparing vertical-temperature, water-vapor, and ozone profiles and to provide basis for comparing merits of at least three of five spectrometric experiments on board. As secondary objectives spacecraft would demonstrate feasibility of determining wind-velocity fields by tracking multiple balloons and demonstrate satisfactory operation of advanced modular three-axis attitude-control system for six months. Nimbus IV carried nine meteorological experiments: three new (backscatter uv spectrometer, filter wedge spectrometer, and selective chopper radiometer) and six carried on previous Nimbus missions (infrared interferometer spectrometer; satellite infrared spectrometer; interrogation, recording, and location system; temperature and humidity infrared radiometer; image-dissector camera system; and monitor of uv solar energy). Spacecraft’s new attitude-control system stabilized Nimbus IV constantly pointing toward earth within 1° accuracy and permitted initial acquisition and reacquisition of earth from any attitude. Butterfly-shaped, 675.2-kg (1488.6-lb) Nimbus IV was fifth in series of seven spacecraft designed to explore and collect data for understanding nature and development of atmosphere and for reduction of economic impact of adverse weather on all nations. Nimbus III had been launched April 14, 1969. (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 70-47; AFSC Release 104.70; GSFC SSR, 4/30/70)

Dr. Donald J. Williams, Director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Disturbances Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., revealed plans to study space weather by squirting small blobs of electrically charged gas out of earth-orbiting satellite. He told 1970 Meeting of Interagency Conference on Weather Modification at Virginia Beach, Va., noaa would fly simple experiment on small geophysical monitoring satellite. “When activated 22 300 miles [35 900 km] above the nighttime earth, the device will trigger a self-quenching flow of electrons into the upper atmosphere. Our proposed experiment in modifying space weather requires interacting with our environment in a scientifically significant yet totally non-destructive way.” If initial release of plasma from satellite caused artificial aurora scientists would “be able to deduce the exact shape of the magnetic field line that passes through the satellite’s position. In addition, the. . .experiment should provide information on diffusion of plasma along field lines, diffusion across field lines, and electric fields deep in the magnetosphere.” Naturally occurring electron-precipitation events were accompanied by many terrestrial effects, including auroral displays, radiopropagation disturbances, and intense, short-lived fluctuations of earth’s magnetic field. If noaa experiment enhanced precipitation from magnetosphere into ionosphere scientists “would then be more certain of the natural processes that cause storms and should be able to improve our predictions of radar clutter and the quality of polar radio communications in future, naturally occurring storms. Once we know more about the magnetosphere, the triggering mechanism of electron precipitation events and their enhancement into geomagnetic storms, we can then consider ways to modify or control such storms when they occur naturally. Thus, the small noaa experiment riding piggyback on a geophysical satellite may be our first step toward ultimate control of our space environment.” (noaa Release 70-85-285)

With advent of SST, information on meteorological conditions at higher levels of stratosphere would be needed for routine civil-aviation operations, Frederick G. Finger and Raymond M. Mclnturff of ESSA’s Weather Bureau said in Science. Forecast system would be extended from 12-km (7.5-mi) to 20-km (12.4-mi) altitudes or higher. Forecasting techniques to support SST might be facilitated by exploiting similarities between stratosphere and troposphere weather. Much remained to be done on phenomenon forecasting. Wind effects should be smaller for SST than for subsonic aircraft but wind forecasts might be necessary during winter, when variations were high enough to effect economics of operation. Knowledge of temperature fields and of ozone distribution could prove valuable. Possible solar cosmic radiation hazards would be minimized by ground-based forecasting system and onboard detection equipment but sonic boom problem at ground level might be less tractable. Amplification and attenuation of boom by meteorological conditions could be predicted. World Weather Watch of U.N. and ESSA’s satellites and spacecraft with ability to depict continuous three-dimensional temperature distribution and wind pressure over entire globe would play major role in providing SST meteorological information, as would SST itself.

(AP, W Star, 6/8/70, B9) Reusability requirement might be most difficult of all. “One can speculate that if we can do it in aircraft engines, why not rocket engines? But we are talking about heat fluxes and turbomachinery characteristics in the shuttle engine that extend well beyond those experienced in the engines of the [Boeing] 707, 747, or even the military high performance aircraft. It is yet to be shown if we can fly 100 missions (or even 10 or 20) with this high performance engine, and achieve the confidence and maintainability which the airline operations have in hand. .. .reusability adds a new dimension to rocket engine development.” (Text) Prof. Yu.

Khodarev, Deputy Director of Institute for Space Research of Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Valery Yevdokimov, head of Academy’s data processing dept., called for studies of what U.S. and U.S.S.R. could do to establish and operate scientific base on moon. Prof. Khodarev said: “We would like to see concrete lists from American scientists of instruments that we could place on the moon for research. Then we can explore further avenues for cooperation in space. We can’t decide how to transport things there until we first decide what we want to take.” There was general acceptance of U.S.S.R. space efforts among Soviet people “but people are looking for a direct payoff—they want something for their money.” Khodarev said U.S. and U.S.S.R. could “cooperate in a Martian program as well as in intense investigations on the moon.” He suggested area for primary investigation from lunar station would have to be decided. “Do we want to look at the moon, or do we want to look into the cosmos from the surface?” During panel discussion Robert L. Lohman of NASA’s Space Station Task Force invited Prof. Khodarev to attend NASA meeting on advanced space programs at ARC later in year.

A.M. Woll of Bureau of Indian Affairs said Indians looked to NASA for help in management of their natural resources. He described project in which geologists had located possible water or mineral source by examining feature 6.4 km (4 mi) in diameter on photo taken by Apollo 9 astronauts to assist Indians at San Carlos Reservation in eastern Arizona to plan water and mineral resources. Photo had shown strange circular formation. Indians also hoped to locate minerals from photos taken from NASA aircraft. nrl scientist N.W. Guinard described use of radar to detect and map oil spills. Tests could be accurate in seas experiencing high winds in which photos would not show oil traces. Radar also was more effective than photography at higher altitudes and could be used in all weather. During meeting LaRC scientists proposed that Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Water Quality Administration, and NASA combine forces in technological assault on pollution in James River in Virginia. Wallops officials described plans for regional workshop in March with Smithsonian Institution and states of Maryland and Virginia to discuss need for regionalized environmental information system.

Intelsat-III F-7 was launched by NASA for ComSatCorp on behalf of International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT). Satellite, launched from etr by three-stage, long-tank Thor-Delta booster, did not reach predicted transfer orbit because bboster underperformed. Engineers fired onboard hydrazine thrusters to push satellite into desired synchronous orbit with 35 772.9km (22 233.0-mi) apogee and 35737.7-km (2221 l.l.-mi) perigee at 19° west longitude over Atlantic. Remaining fuel was expected to maintain satellite in orbit over Atlantic for five years. Full-time commercial service was scheduled to begin May 8. Intelsat-III F-7 was fifth successful launch in Intelsat III series. Last successful mission, Intelsat-IIIF-6, had been launched Jan. 14. (ComSatCorp Release 70-26; NASA Proj Off)
At NASA Hq. industry briefing on space program for 1970s and beyond, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, said: “I think that when we talk about reducing the overall aerospace program by 12 percent, we have to look at the other side of the point too.. .we will still be spending $3.3 billion in the 71 budget, and I think by any possible measure that puts the space program very, very high in the nation’s priorities.” Major reduction would be in manned spaceflight “from a little over $2 billion in FY 70 to $1,474,000,000 in 71.” With “the manned lunar landing behind us, with almost all the initial buy of 15 vehicles now completed, we are able to take a major reduction in the Apollo account as that program reaches a logical termination. We had hoped to continue the Saturn V at limited production of several a year. The decision was made under these austere conditions that we would terminate that production and take the savings.” Peak NASA expenditure of $6 billion in 1965 included outlay for buildup of total NASA base. Fact “that we are now down between the three and four billion mark by no means means that we will be operating at a substantially lower space activity than we had at the peak. It reflects more the fact that the base is now completed; we can put a much higher percentage of our expenditures into program.” However, FY 1971 budget would delay Apollo Applications flight until end of 1972; stretch Apollo lunar flights to two a year, with Apollo 16 occurring before aa program launch in 1972-1973 and Apollo 17 and 18 after aa program missions; delay ATS-F and ats-G by one year, and Viking-Mars lander from 1973 to 1975; and reduce NASA operational base by shutting down erc and possibly mothballing Mississippi Test Facility. Dr. Paine said NASA aeronautics effort would increase. “We feel that much of the work that will be going forward in the shuttle program will probably have some spin-off into the aeronautics area.” Emphasis would be placed on v/STOL and quiet engines. Orbiting Solar Observatory launch recommended by Space Task Group for 1975 would be delayed to 1976. Interplanetary Monitoring Probes originally scheduled for 1971 and 1972 would be launched in 1972 and 1973 and ISIS would be moved from 1970 and 1972 to 1971 and 1973. Synchronous Meteorological Satellites each would slip one year, to 1972 and 1973, and Applications Technology Satellites, one year, to 1973 and 1975. lunar roving vehicle would be carried on Apollo 16,17, 18, and 19. Decision on whether to fund two or three space shuttle definition studies would be made after proposals were received. In space station area experimental requirements would be emphasized. Two Phase-B definition studies were under way. Summer study of utilization of space stations would be international conference “with, we hope, strong participation from the European space research organization.” nerva studies would continue. Dale D. Myers, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, told conference that “with the technology we already have in hand” antipollution program could be initiated “to produce a space reflector—maybe it will have to be a mile [1.6 km] in diameter—that can direct the sun’s energy to create holes over our cities which would act as chimneys to evacuate smog.” (Transcript)

Washington Sunday Star editorial commented on SST: “What the SST adds up to is a large question mark, a gamble with public funds and the environment that comes at time of crisis in both areas. We should improve the odds for survival by pulling out of the SST race until the facts—not the suppositions—are in. We should gamble not on a questionable investment, but on the ability of our economy and our prestige to withstand the impact of losing one part of one industry’s market if the Concorde lives up to its sponsors’ expectations. The ssTprogram should be shelved.” (W Star, 10/4/70, Bl) Soviet scientist Dr. K. Y. Kondratyev described October 1969 experiment in which Soyuz VI and VII spacecraft had been observed simultaneously from on>. aircraft at 7900-m (26 000-ft) altitude, from one at much lower altitude, and from ground, to determine atmospheric distortion of observations of earth surface from space. Additional observations from Soyuz IX in June 1970 and automated measurements from unmanned Cosmos CCXLIII launched Sept. 23, 1968, had combined to show fully equipped space station could clearly identify forms and densities of vegetation; chart geologic formations in inaccessible regions; identify soil suitable for agriculture; trace origin of fungus blights; sight outbreaks of blight and pinpoint forest fires; chart ground temperatures, identifying trends in volcanic activity and mountain building; detect erosion patterns invisible from ground; record seasonal flow patterns in watershed; monitor spread of pollutants; monitor seas for fish movement and evidence of pollution; and transmit photos indicating safe shipping lanes in Arctic ice pack areas. Dr. Kondratyev said orbital space station could be developed within next 5 to 10 yrs and be equipped with sensor system to scan earth at wide range of wavelengths for remote sensing of environment. (Congress Bulletin, 10/6/70,1; NYT, 10/6/70, 21; nasapao) Dr. Charles A. Berry, msc Director of Medical Operations, and Prof. Oleg G. Gazenko, Director of Soviet Institute of Biomedical Problems, said selection of crews for longer space missions would require special personality testing to identify persons of more dominant type for assignment of roles compatible with that trait. Dr. Berry said he thought use of multinational flight crews was good idea but chances for Orbiting International Laboratory (oil) in near future seemed slim because of problems of language, attitudes, and prejudices such as food preferences. “We can’t have a restaurant with a very large menu.” In interview, Dr. Berry and Prof. Gazenko discussed flashes of light experienced by astronauts in space with eyes closed or in darkened spacecraft. Dr. Berry believed flashes might be produced by heavy cosmic ray particles—atomic nuclei of intermediate weight—that produced ionization in eye retina, affected nervous system, or caused light flashes within eye fluid. Dr. Gazenko said heavy cosmic rays were insufficiently frequent to account for flashes. Soviet cosmonauts had not experienced phenomenon. (Sullivan, NYT, 10/12/70, 19) Cosmonauts Andrian G. Nikolayev and Vitaly I. Sevastyanov said muscles of Soyuz IX crew were so atrophied after June 2-19 mission that they stood up with difficulty and walked with peculiar stamping steps. On landing they were so weak that ground crew had to assist them from hatch. Sensation of heaviness lasted 10 to 11 days. Crew had performed antiatrophy exercises during mission but more intensive exercise program might be needed for flights to other planets, with simulation of gravity included. Cosmonauts felt effects of weightlessness were not dangerous unless experienced for more than one month. Soyuz IX cosmonauts displayed photos of June 2 launch and colored films taken inside spacecraft during 18-day orbit. Nikolayev said cosmonauts had slept with head down before launch, to become accustomed to rush of blood to head that had bothered previous cosmonauts and astronauts on early part of flights. Soyuz spacecraft had three sections: orbital module in which cosmonauts slept, exercised, and played chess; central module with three windows and couches for use in liftoff and reentry; and third module containing service equipment. Both orbital and service modules were jettisoned before reentry. (Sullivan, NYT, 10/10/70) Indian government scientists H. G. S. Murthy, E. V. Chirnis, and K. S. Karnik urged U.S. and U.S.S.R. to share economic benefits of space exploration with developing nations. “International cooperation in global planning of assistance for the operation of meteorological communications and navigation satellites will go a long way in helping developing countries. National space programs in developing countries are not a luxury, but a necessity.” (Benedict, AP, Huntsville Times, 10/7/70) Third International Symposium on Space Rescue was held as part of iaf congress. Cochairman P. A. Campbell said letter from Soviet Academy of Sciences had nominated for first time four Soviet engineers to serve on IAF’s 11-nation committee studying space rescue. Later AP quoted iaf Congress sources as saying Soviet engineers might meet with U.S. experts at MSC in November. Herbert Schaefer and Dr. Jack W. Wild of nasa Advanced Manned Missions program said space rescue vehicles would have to be versatile, with several payloads kept at hand to deal with variety of emergencies. Standardized docking system would be needed on all future manned spacecraft to permit rescue by any nation. NASA Assistant Safety Director Philip H. Bolger said, “The rescue of stranded astronauts is a concern recognized by all nations and therefore provides a common base for establishing international cooperation.” It was too late to develop rescue system for four remaining Apollo flights, but reliability of Apollo spacecraft was being improved. Bolger said Skylab three-man space station scheduled for 1972 launch might have double protection—spacecraft that could be separated and returned to earth and standby rescue rocket at ksc. (AP, W Star, 10/8/70, A4; Sullivan, NYT, 10/8/70,4) LeRoy E. Day, Manager of NASA Space Shuttle Task Group, described system characteristics of space shuttle: “It should be a fully reusable two-stage vertical take-off and horizontal landing space vehicle” that could transport 11 340 kg (25 000 lbs) to the design reference orbit of 500 km (310 mi) at 55° orbital inclination. Shuttle “must have a large internal cargo bay which will give it the capability of carrying a variety of manned and unmanned payloads to low earth orbit. The large internal payload compartment will allow the shuttle to deliver to low earth orbit both a satellite and a high energy stage for a synchronus orbit or a planetary mission. We expect the gross jift-olf weight. . .to be approximately 1.6 million kilograms [3.5 million lbs] fully fueled and with the payload on-board.” Rocket engines would be one of most critical subsystems “For both the booster and the orbiter we will use high pressure hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines which can be throttled to keep the acceleration during ascent to less than 3 g’s.” (Text) Dr. George E. Mueller, General Dynamics Corp. Vice President and former NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said U.S. space shuttle could be “golden transport” to carry passengers between any two cities on earth in an hour in 1980s. Shuttle could be converted easily to transport flying to 130-km (80-mi) altitude and plunging back to target city at approximately 18 500 km per hr (11 500 mph). Rocket-boosted aircraft would take off vertically, eliminating noise problem. Other nations might purchase U.S. shuttle for $50 million.

Results of Apollo 12 experiment to measure permanent and induced magnetic fields on lunar surface with magnetometer deployed on eastern edge of Ocean of Storms during EVA were reported in Science by ARC scientists Palmer Dyal, Curtis W. Parkin, and Charles P. Sonett. Magnetometer had measured steady magnetic field of 36±5 gammas on lunar surface. Surface gradient measurements and data from lunar orbiting satellite Explorer XXXV (launched July 19, 1967) indicated field was localized rather than global. Data suggested source of field was large magnetized body that had acquired field during epoch in which inducing field was much stronger than any now on moon. (Science, 8/21/70, 762-4)

ComSatCorp sent annual report to shareholders on 1969 activities. Financial report had been released Feb. 20. In letter to shareholders ComSatCorp President Joseph V. Charyk and Chairman James McCormack said: “Outstanding progress has been made in the establishment of the global communications satellite system. . .a goal toward which comsat and the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (Intelsat) have worked since inception. This basic goal was achieved when a satellite was placed over the Indian Ocean in the summer of 1969. ... In addition, the pace of earth station development by national entities in many countries has been significant. Investment worldwide of about $200 million in earth stations and more than $100 million in satellites reflects a widespread confidence in the present and future benefits of satellite communications.” Highlights of 1969 included achievement of major intelsat goal, global coverage by comsat; full commerical operation of 22 new antennas in 18 countries; start of construction on Intelsat IV series satellites and selection of Atlas-Centaur as series launch vehicle; completion of ComSat Laboratories, major r&d facility; and reaffirmation by ComSatCorp of its readiness to finance, establish, and operate domestic comsat system.

Ailing aerospace industry” was described by Leroy F. Aarons in Washington Post: Since early 1968, aerospace employment in California had dropped from high of 616 000 to 525 000 in March 1969. “Roughly 30 percent of these were professional and technical personnel.” North American Rockwell Corp. had accounted for “nearly a third of the layoffs.” Since December 1969, NR had cut Los Angeles Div. to “skeleton force of 4660, half of whom took pay cuts.” Spokesman for State Unemployment Office in Van Nuys, Calif., had said desperation had driven out-of-work professionals into variety of positions at pay cuts of 50% to 60%. Aerospace engineering association official had explained that base technology had been developed. “We don’t need propulsion groups of thousands of people to figure out how to make a missile fly any longer. Maybe we need 100 to come up with amodification.” (WPost, 5/18/70, Al) Daniel Z. Henkin, Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs), disclosed in speech the existence of second “Chinese object” orbiting earth about 3200 km (2000 mi) ahead of active satellite launched by Communist Chinese April 24. He said dod believed “that this is part of the final stage of the missile which orbited the satellite.” Significance of launch was “that the Communist Chinese have the capability to put in orbit a considerable payload,” which confirmed technological progress; “prudence requires that we continue to credit them with a near term capability to fire their first icbm.” (faa Release 70-48; Text)

Eggers, Jr., NASA Assistant Administrator for Policy; Richard H. Petersen, Senior Research Scientist in arc Mission Analysis Div.; and Nathaniel B. Cohen, special assistant in NASA policy research program. Because of long-life requirements of its structure, it was unlikely that hypersonic transport would be developed until operational experience was available on some other hypersonic aircraft. Therefore, hypersonic transport would benefit not only from technology developed for space-shuttle vehicle, but very probably from experience gained during shuttle operation. Operating experience with high-temperature structures would help immensely in developing longer life structures for hypersonic transport and gain considerable new knowledge of hypersonic aerodynamics. In contrast to situation in aerodynamics and structures, technology program being planned by NASA to support development of rocket propulsion for shuttle would not contribute significantly to hypersonic airbreathing-propulsion-system technology. Current generalized scramjet research program had amply demonstrated feasibility of such engines. Developing airbreathing propulsion for either hypersonic transport or secondgeneration airbreathing 1st stage for space shuttle would require applied program focused specifically on scramjet.

Press editorials commented on President Nixon’s statement on Nation’s space program. New York Times: “If the President’s program is fulfilled pn schedule, the economics of space activity—both its costs and its dividends for nonscientists here on earth—will be revolutionized. The reconnaissance activities of earth resources satellites have enormous potentials for aiding agriculture, forestry, the search for new minerals, and the exploitation of the seas. The prospect of communications satellites that can broadcast radio and television programs directly to homes everywhere offers exciting new perspectives for further unifying all peoples, while simultaneously raising delicate political problems. . . . When it becomes available, the reusable space shuttle will. . .facilitate construction of a permanent manned orbiting space station that will open up new areas of scientific and economic activity in the near neighborhood of earth.” (NYT, 3/9/70) Washington Evening Star: “The 1970’s promise to be an exciting decade in space, not just a comedown from the exhilaration of the initial moon landings. The next 10 years will be even more satisfying if another of the President’s goals—increased international cooperation in space—is realized. To that end, Soviet space scientists have been told about the U.S. plans. The Russian leaders would do well to consider the economies and other benefits that could come from pooling skills and resources as man reaches farther and farther beyond his planet.” (W Star, 3/9/70) Washington Post: “It was appropriate that President Nixon should announce his proposed plans for exploration in space on the last day in this century when a total eclipse of the sun was visible in the United States. Opportunities to make strides in learning about our universe do not come often and must be seized when they arrive. The scientists. . .did the best that could be done in Saturday’s brief moment of darkness to learn more about the forces in the sun that dominate our solar system. And the President seems to have done about the best that can be done with the resources now available to keep our space program on the right track. “The emphasis the Administration is giving to unmanned flight activities—the commitments to launch vehicles in 1977 and 1979 for grand tours of our outermost planets are the most exciting—will test the willingness of the nation to spend huge sums on basic research. The future programs of NASA, at least for the next decade, will have little of the appeal that seized the public during the race to land men on the moon first. And the worth of these programs, in terms of knowledge they may yield about the solar system and the usefulness of that knowledge, is difficult to appreciate fully. The test in the future will be whether we are willing to pay for these probes for knowledge without the exhilarating experience of watching the first man step onto the moon’s surface, and of beating the Russians.” (W Post, 3/9/70)

President Nixon sent to Congress Annual Report on Activities and Accomplishments under the Communications Satellite Act of 1962. He said: “Communications between Earth and the Moon, while certainly the most dramatic use, is only one of many ways in which satellite communications can now be employed. The Intelsat Consortium of more than 70 nations has been highly successful in bringing the benefits of communications satellite technology to the people of many nations. This report reflects the steady progress being made toward an improved global communications network. Already we see major improvements in international telecommunications capabilities—improvements that will ultimately benefit all of the world’s people.” Report said 1969 “saw the largest annual increase in the number of operational earth stations in the history of INTELSAT.” At year’s end, 41 earth station antennas were in operation in 24 countries. “Nine other stations or additional antennas are expected to be in service within the first six months of 1970.” (PD, 3/2/70, 275; H Doc 91-264)

Uhuru (Explorer XL]I) Small Astronomy Satellite was (aimdied into an equatorial orbit by Italy Iron the San Marco launch platform off the coast of Kenya, East Africa, on Kenya’s Independence Day. “Lfhuru" was the Swahili word for “freedom." Boosted by a four-stage Scout vehicle to map x-ray sources both within and beyond the Milky Way Galaxy, the satellite was the first launched for the United States by another country. At left Mrs. Marjorie Townsend, project manager, discussed satellite performance with a colleague during p re flight tests at Goddard Space Flight Center. During first day of operation Uhuru was expected to collect more data than had been obtained with sounding rockets in past eight years. Satellite’s Jong observing time, rather than the few minutes for sounding rockets, would permit observation of x-ray sources from 30 to 50 times fainter than those observed thus far, probably increasing number of observed x-ray sources from 540 to several hundred. Uhuru was first in series of three explorers in Small Astronomy Satellite program to survey sky above earth’s atmosphere and identify x-ray, gamma-ray, UV, and infrared sources. It was first U.S. satellite launched by another country.

Aldrin, Jr.; Apollo 12 Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Richard F. Gordon, and Alan L. Bean; and Apollo 13 Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., John L. Swigert, Jr., and Fred W. Haise, Jr. Vice President said award ceremony was “perhaps the most significant since NASA was founded. Those individuals we honor have accomplished goals that required over a decade of vision, hard work, determination and courage by thousands in the NASA, industry, and university research and development team. ... NASA has had an outstanding beginning, successfully meeting its challenging mission and goals.... Though some reordering of national priorities and some fiscal constraints will not permit us to do all the things we would like to do in the immediate future, the future still holds many challenges and wonderful opportunities.... I am proud of you, the President is proud of you. We salute you.” Dr. Low said NASA could look forward to new achievements in program designed “to maintain that hard-earned lead, but one that also recognizes the many other problems that we as a nation must face. Today,we are moving forward on all...fronts—we have accepted the challenge of the future—a challenge in aeronautics, a challenge in science, a challenge in applications, and above all, a challenge in the exploration of the unknown.” Presidential Medal of Freedom was presented to Apollo 11 and Apollo 13 astronauts and to Apollo 13 Mission Operations Team.

NASA Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition Gerald M. Truszynski testified before House Committee: Tracking networks had supported 101 manned and unmanned missions in addition to Apollo 11 in 1969. Meeting basic requirements of flight projects when budget was at “minimum level” had required significant reductions in overall network capability. Planned improvements had been deferred in FY 1969 for second year and, for first time, sustaining equipment items had been deferred. FY 1971 request of $299.3 million—$298.0 million for R&D and $1.3 million for construction—included MSFN equipment to support Apollo Applications program while continuing alsep support. Satellite Network reductions in FY 1969 had terminated or greatly reduced support of several in-orbit spacecraft still capable of transmitting valuable scientific data. Remaining workload of some 45 satellites! continued to require around-the-clock bperationsjatimostlnet-work stations. Many satellites already aloft would require support in FY 1971, as would 10 new spacecraft scheduled for launch. FY 1971 equipment replacement program was critical. Network could support only portion of spacecraft passes and reliability was essential. Continued support from dsn overseas facilities would be needed to support four on-going Pioneer missions and Mariner VI and VII. Major increase in workload in late FY 1971 with launch of dual Mariner ’71 mission would require substantial preparatory engineering effort, as would multimission capability for future programs of Pioneer F and G, Mariner/Mercury ’73, and Helios.

Kenneth W. Gatland, Vice President of British Interplanetary Society, told press in London that U.S.S.R. had been testing satellite designed to destroy U.S. military satellites. Claim, he said, was substantiated by studies from Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnbor-ough. Cosmos CCCLXXIII (launched Oct. 20) had been a target; Cosmos CCCLXXIV (launched Oct. 23) had been orbited to same altitude as Cosmos CCCLXXIII and then exploded, apparently on ground command. Six large fragments had been identified. Gatland said objective could have been to destroy Cosmos CCCLXXIII with the fragments or to use radiation from a nuclear explosion to make it inoperable. Cosmos CCCLXXVflaunched Oct. 30) had been test of same system. (AP, B Sun, 11/3/70, A2; W Star, 11/3/70)

Lawrence Lessing said in Fortune that satellites were “only hope in sight” for comprehensive air traffic control: “Growing congestion and delays are seriously impairing U.S. and international airline operations, and air-traffic control is at the nerve center of the congestive problem. For nearly a decade leading scientists have urged the development of an advanced space-satellite system for navigation and traffic control. Indeed, such a system is the only hope in sight if air traffic is to grow to its full potential through the rest of this century. Only now, under the pressure of events, is this proposal reaching a critical point of decision.” (Fortune, 8/70, 11586) .

Complex space tug NASA was planning as part of integrated space transportation system was described in Washington Evening Starby John Lannan. Tug would be assembled like “astronaut’s erector set.” It would consist of propulsion, living, cargo, and electronic control modules and could be “put together or broken down to meet any immediate need.” Tug would be used to land men on moon for long-term stays, to push and pull large pieces of space hardware to assemble them into space stations or interplanetary vehicles, and for astronaut rescue. Tug, launched into orbit aboard shuttle, would never return to earth. It was designed for 3-yr, 10-mission lifetime and would be chemically re-refueled with oxygen and hydrogen replenished by tanker shuttle. NASA expected tug to deliver 27 20031 750 kg (60 000-70 000 lbs) of gear to lunar surface during 28-day lunar surface mission. NASA wanted vehicle to be capable of 90° orbit change and of servicing geosynchronous satellites at 35 900-km (22 300-mi) altitude. (W Star, 9/19/870, Al)

Library of Congress Legislative Reference Service published United States and Soviet Progress in Space: How do the Nations Compare? Report by Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of Science Policy Div., summarized 12-yr efforts of major space powers. U.S. expected to have spent by June 30, 1970, just over $56 billion on combined military and civilian space programs in which some half million persons had been employed. It was likely U.S.S.R. had “committed a similar amount of resources.” U.S. space employment had peaked; Soviet had not, “as judged by their rising number of launchings.” There was no evidence that total Soviet aerospace industry was as fully equipped as U.S., but missiles of differing design philosophies seen in Moscow parades suggested “more than one design and development team for space work just as in Soviet aviation.” Each country seemed adequately equipped with launch pads. U.S.S.R. claimed nationwide tracking system but relied on ships to fill gaps. U.S.S.R. was still using icbm with 1400-kg (3000-lb) thrust and improved staging to boost 4700-kg (10 400-lb) Vostok and 6600-kg (14 500-lb) Soyuz. Proton launch vehicle had carried 16 800 kg (37 000 lbs) to earth orbit and might have potential to lift 27 200 kg (60 000 lbs) with circumlunar capacity of 6000 kg (14 500 lbs). “We have not yet seen the very large Soviet vehicle confidently predicted by NASA officials the last three years. Lesser Soviet launch vehicles account for unmanned programs.” There was no sign of Soviet breakthrough in fuels “but their engines are run at relatively high pressure, increasing efficiency.” There was no sign that solid-fuel rockets had been used by U.S.S.R. for space purposes and question of Soviet development of nuclear rocket was “highly speculative.” Soviet work on electric rockets had reached only “early proof-of-principle” stage. U.S. Saturn V was “clearly the best operational weight lifter in the world.” Odds were “overwhelming” that Vladimir Komarov had been only Soviet Cosmonaut killed in space so far. “This is because the Russians have followed a conservative approach to manned flight with heavy vehicles allowing much redundancy in equipment.” There seemed to be “little difference between the Soviet and U.S. space programs as to general purpose and direction.” About three fifths of U.S. flights were conducted for dod; similar heavy military emphasis existed in U.S.S.R. “Soviet Union has a large and regular program of military support flights including use of satellites for photographic observation, electronic listening, weather reporting, communications relaying, and ship navigation.” U.S. did not have fob program, “because it does not regard them as necessary or desirable. The Russians obviously do, for reasons not wholly clear.” While assessment could not be conclusive, “suspicion remains that a capability to inspect and destroy satellites has been created” by U.S.S.R. In space applications, U.S. “has held a clear lead from the earlier days of the space program, and this experience has permitted us to move ahead to more advanced systems while the Soviet Union was still working hard to catch up.” U.S.S.R. had made greater effort in number of lunar and planetary flights, “but so far has not gained as good results as we have from a more modest program.” Some 14% of Soviet flights had been in escape mission category and 8% of U.S. flights. Reasonable assumption was “that manned flights by the Russians to the Moon will come as soon as they solve their present problems of unreliability of hardware.” Question of U.S. and U.S.S.R. going to moon together “has been asked more in rhetorical sense than as a concrete offer by either side.” No assessment of prospects could be made “without forecasting the future political climate which is beyond our present capabilities.” (Text)

Total NASA new obligational authority (noa) requested, $3,333 billion, was $404.9 million less than FY 1970 noa of $3,737 billion. NASA expenditures were budgeted to decline $486.4 million, from FY 1970 level of $3,889 billion to $3,403 billion. Reductions placed proposed NASA FY 1971 funding at lowest level since 1962. Of budget request, $2,606 billion would go for r&d, $34.6 million for construction of facilities, and $692.3 million for research and program management. Apollo funding decrease of $729.6 million, to $956.50 million in FY 1971, reflecting successful completion of manned lunar landing goal, would be partially offset by increase to $515.2 million for manned space flight operations. The $515.2 million would include $364.3 million for Apollo Applications, $110 million for space shuttie and station, and $40.9 million for operations. Advanced missions would receive $2.5 million, same as in FY 1970, to bring total for manned space flight to $1,474 billion, down $557.5 million from FY Funding for space science and applications programs would increase $45.9 million, from $519.7 million in FY 1970 to $565.7 million. Increases would go to physics and astronomy program, for airborne research ($3 million), s<Jlar observatories ($16.1 million), and Explorer satellites ($25.6 million). Funding for Pioneer program of planetary exploration would increase from $20 million in FY 1970 to $32.9 million. Funding for biosatellites would decrease from $6 million in FY 1970 to $1.5 million. Earth resources survey would receive more than 50% increase in funding, from $26 million to $52.5 million, with $41.5 million allocated for Earth Resources Technology Satellite. New projects funded were navigation and traffic control studies (with dot), $3 million, and Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp) study, $1 million. Total for advanced research and technology programs would be reduced from $272 million in FY 1970 to $264 million, nerva rocket funding would increase from $27 million to $32 million. Increases also were proposed for v/stol aircraft technology ($15 million in FY 1971, from $9.5 million in FY 1970), subsonic aircraft technology ($11.9 million, from $9.4 million in FY 1970), and supersonic aircraft technology ($21.9 million, from $18.9 million in FY 1970), within total $185.5 million requested for aeronautics. Sustaining university program was being phased out, with no funds requested for FY 1971. dod space funding, down $82 million, reflected cancellation of mol program. FY 1971 funding would support satellite development, portions of missile development, and range operations. AEC’s requested $99 million reflected slight decreases for development of nerva rocket and space nuclear electric power sources for space applications. Funds for Depts. of Interior and Agriculture would support participation in erts project.

Conclusion of gao report “seems to rest on the single detail that Fairchild’s proposal was submitted one week earlier than ours. .. .both parties had the opportunity to inform NASA when they could submit their proposal and both parties responded accordingly. The Fairchild implication that this difference in time could have been used unfairly by General Electric by our learning our competitor’s price and changing ours is a shocking allegation. No such ‘leak’ occurred, and the gao report specifically states that there is no evidence to support that allegation.” Fink said facts were “that both parties competed hard for this important space program which has the potential of contributing greatly to our well being in this country and in several foreign countries where this communications satellite will be used.” (Text)

Noaa I (ITOS-A) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorological satellite was successfully launched by NASA from wtr at 3:35 am pst by two-stage, long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta (DSV-3N-6) booster. Orbital parameters: apogee, 1472.2 km (914.8 mi); perigee, 1422.6 km (884 mi); period, 114.8 min; and inclination, 102°. Primary objective was to place 306-kg (675-lb) spacecraft in sun-synchronous orbit with local equator-crossing time between 3:00 and 3:20 pm and conduct in-orbit engineering evaluation so that daytime and nighttime cloud-cover observations could be obtained regularly and dependably by both direct readout and onboard storage. Equipment included two avcs, two apt camera systems, and two scanning radiometers to measure surface temperature in cloud-free areas and provide cloud-cover data in visible and infrared channels. As secondary objective launch vehicle carried 2.3-kg (5-lb) Cepe Cylindrical Electrostatic Probe Experiment permanently attached to Delta 2nd stage, to provide information on electron density and temperature and on ion current during first two orbits. Cepe entered orbit with 1475.1-km (916.6-mi) apogee, 1425.4-km (885.7-mi) perigee, 114.9-min period, and 101.9° inclination.

Philadelphia Inquirer editorial commented on Communist Chinese satellite: “To assume that the Red Chinese will refrain from placing hydrogen warheads in orbiting satellites, capable of being released by remote control on signal from Peking, is to engage in the most dangerous kind of head-in-the-sand complacency.” (PInq, 4/17/70)
In NASA-sponsored solar eclipse project scientists used spacecraft in deep space, earth-orbiting satellites, instruments on ground, and sounding rockets to make intense study, concentrating on eclipse’s effect on earth’s atmosphere and ionosphere. In-space observations were conducted with four NASA spacecraft and three U.S.-Canada satellites. Radio signals from Mariner VI on far side of sun were measured to determine how eclipse affected signals and to study changes in charged particles in earth’s atmosphere. Oso V and Oso VI, in earth orbit, pointed instruments at sun to gather data on sun and solar atmosphere, and Ats III photographed earth and its cloud-cover to show path of eclipse across northern hemisphere. American-Canadian satellites Alouette I, Alouette II, and Isis I investigated eclipse-caused changes in ionosphere. Ground observations were conducted by observers from three universities and four NASA centers at sites in Virginia and Mexico. At site near Sandbridge, Va., Univ. of Michigan team photographed solar corona and LaRC experimenter photographed solar flash spectrum that was too weak to be seen when sun was not obscured. LaRC, GSFC, and sao scientists used four Super Schmidt Meteor Cameras at Wallops Island, Eastville, and Sandbridge, Va., to photograph faint comets believed to be near sun. At LaRC, Univ. of Colorado scientists used optical assembly for two Wallaston prisms on LaRC’s 241-mm (9.5-in) Cassegrain telescope to investigate difference between color of tangentially and radially polarized radiation from solar K-corona. arc scientists photographed full intermediate-scale coronal structure, using special radial transmission filter in front of LaRC telescope’s prime focus. In Mexico LaRC scientists used NASA’s mobile Satellite Photometric Observatory in path of totality at Miahuatlan to determine intensity of coronal radiation to 1% accuracy. Simultaneous wideband monitor measurements of intensity and polarization of coronal radiation were made out to 3.2 million km (2 million mi) from sun to determine for first time fine structure of coronal electron density and temperature. Team of MSC and Univ. of Houston scientists made variety of observations near Miahuatlan in attempt to separate F- and K-coronas, determine structure of coronas, and study interplanetary dust and particles by measuring coronal intensity and radiation, recording flash chromosphere spectrum, and using photographic and photoelectric techniques to study shadow bands. Data from satellite and ground observations would be compared

aiaa Earth Resources Conference to consider technical, economic, and political aspects of global satellite system was held in Annapolis, Md. In keynote address Under Secretary of State U. Alexis Johnson said surveying earth’s resources from space could change face of international relations. He warned nations must organize international survey program to avoid serious diplomatic problems when system became operational in few years. “We should start now to consider with other countries how best to capitalize and coordinate earth resource surveying systems as they come to serve the interests of many countries. People value what they pay for and they will not contribute to a U.S. program.” Problem of how to handle data gathered from country not participating or not wanting information known was major problem. Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.), Chairman of Subcommittee on NASA Oversight of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said NASA’s projected new program costs were “unrealistically low.” He predicted, “There will be pressure on Congress to reduce the space budget still further unless the future orientation of the program is based less on space spectaculars and more on the production of tangible benefits.” ERC and mit research teams reported that camera and sensor systems for survey satellites had shown in aircraft and balloon tests along northeastern coast of U S. that air and water pollution could be monitored effectively and traced to sources by satellites.

essa announced two-year program to complete U.S.-Canadian satellite triangulation program—highly accurate geodetic-survey network with stations 1000 to 1300 km (600 to 800 mi) apart linking Canada with Alaska and lower 48 states. Program had been initiated in 1964 with Echo I and II balloon satellites and suspended when June 23, 1966, launch of Pageos I signaled start of worldwide program in which simultaneous observations from 41 portable camera stations would be used to construct three-dimensional geodetic reference system. System would measure distance between two surface points on earth 4800 km (3000 mi) apart with 9.8-m (32-ft) accuracy. Pageos /would be photographed from U.S. and Canadian sites in new program to enable land surveyors and engineers to start their surveys from geodetic control points with greater accuracy. Completion of North American network could give measurements with accuracy of 1:1 000000, comparable to error of 305 mm (12 in) in approximately 322 km (200 mi). (ESSA Release 70-46)

Gen. John D. Ryan, usaf Chief of Staff, presented usaf FY 1971 budget request to House Committee on Armed Services: U.S.S.R.’s operational icbm force outnumbered that of U.S. and, “by mid-1971, will probably exceed ours by several hundred launchers.’’ Soviets had technology to develop hard-target MIRV and “Fractional Orbit Bombardment (fobs) or depressed trajectory icbm (dicbm) may already be operational. Their new ‘swing-wing’ bomber prototype could become operational, and their submarine-launched ballistic missile force is expanding rapidly.” U.S. continued to reduce bomber strength of Strategic Air Command. “We have phased out the B-58s, and severely cut back the FB-llls. At end FY-71, we will have fewer B-52s and 66 FB-llls. We hope to offset the reduced strength by increasing the capability of our bombers with the Short Range Attack Missile (sram) and the Subsonic Cruise Armed Decoy (scad) and providing for increased prelaunch survivability through satellite basing and improved warning.” In last five years, “we have cut our active interceptor strength by two-thirds and our radars by one-half. The Soviets during this period have maintained their Long Range Aviation forces at about 200 heavy bombers and over 700 medium bombers and tankers. ...” (Testimony) In testimony before Senate Armed Services Committee, L/G Otto J.

J. W. Chamberlain, Associate Director for Planetary Sciences at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Ariz., reviewed cosmological theory for systematical exploration of outer planets in Astronautics & Aeronautics. Jovian planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune— had high intrinsic interest because their characteristics were similar to one another’s but “vastly different” from those of terrestrial planets. Atmospheric distinctions which did exist among Jovian planets had probably “arisen from relatively minor differences in the prevailing conditions at the times of their birth.” Major planets constituted “completely different kind of object.” Nearest and biggest—Jupiter—had over 1000 times earth’s volume and 300 times earth’s mass for mean density of only 1.3 times that of water. It was “guardian (if not the parent) of a large family of at least 12 satellites, two of which are as large as a small planet. It has a daily rotation period of only 10 hr; and its atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, the most abundant elements in the Sun (and the universe itself. ..).” Neptune was “most distant of the giants” and Pluto was “nonconformist of the solar system” whose orbit “is far from circular, the solar distance ranging between about 30 and 50 A.U. [30 and 50 times distance from earth to sun] during its 248-year revolution, at a 17-deg inclination to the ecliptic.” Many astronomers suspected larger differences between terrestrial and major planets held clues to formation of solar system.

Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, said at NASA Hq. news conference on future plans he was directing portions of space program to bring operations in line with FY 1971 budget. “We recognize the many important needs and urgent problems we face here on earth. America’s space achievements in the 1960’s have rightly raised hopes that this country and all mankind can do more to overcome pressing problems of society. The space program should inspire bolder solutions and suggest new approaches. It has already provided many direct and indirect benefits and is creating new wealth and capabilities.” Strong space program continued as one of Nation’s major priorities. “However, we recognize that under current fiscal restraints NASA must find new ways to stretch out current programs and reduce our present operational base.” NASA would “press forward in 1971 at a reduced level, but in the right direction with the basic ingredients we need for major achievements in the 1970s and beyond. .. .we will not dissipate the strong teams that sent men to explore the moon and automated spacecraft to observe the planets.” NASA would suspend Saturn V production indefinitely after Saturn V 515 completion, stretch Apollo lunar missions to six-month launch intervals, defer lunar expeditions during aap space station flights in 1972, and postpone Viking/Mars 1973 unmanned lander launch to next Mars opportunity in 1975. Number of employees in nasa program was expected to decline from 190 000 at end of FY 1970 to 140 000 at close of FY 1971. Positive aspects of space program for 1970s included Apollo missions through Apollo 19, use of one Saturn V to launch first experimental aap space station into earth orbit in 1972, Mars orbit by two unmanned spacecraft in 1971, launch of first Jupiter probe in 1972, launch of spacecraft past Venus to Mercury in 1973, and continuation of scientific satellite launches. Design of reusable space shuttle would be started and first experimental space station would be launched, as planned, in 1972. FY 1971 budget would permit proceeding with design of advanced space station as permanent base in earth orbit, continued work on nasa-aec nerva project, practical earth applications of space technology, and advances in applications of space technology in fields such as meteorology and communications. Although “austere,” space program for 1971 was “forward looking” and contained “basic ingredients needed for an effective space program in the 1970s.” It would “extend our space capabilities, expand our scientific knowledge, and make available new applications of benefit to people here on earth.” In response to question, Dr. Paine said he foresaw no shutdown of ksc and had no plans for closing other centers. Intended actions “represent a decision to proceed through the year 1971 and see what our studies turn up. I think it is important to realize these are very advanced, perhaps, and we have a lot to learn about the technological feasibility, the cost, schedules—and I wouldn’t want to say we now have a complete free road into the future. We don’t.” Asked if he thought NASA was close to point where “team started falling to pieces,” Dr. Paine said that “you can carry out space programs for the United States at a large number of different levels. I think the level we have now is a level we can take great pride in and I think the country in the 1970’s will be very proud of the achievements NASA will turn in.” (Transcript)
European space accomplishments were reviewed in Science Journal: ESRO was evolving as center for scientific and applications satellites and was interested in developing satellites for meteorology, navigation, and air traffic control. Less successful had been European efforts to obtain independence in satellite launching through eldo. U.S. had introduced new element into European deliberations by inviting collaboration in post-Apollo program. “So far the U.S. State Department has ruled against the purchase of American launch vehicles for European commercial ventures, such as the regional communications satellite. This could be changed by cooperation in the post-Apollo programme. Europe could reserve the right to buy boosters for any non-military application.” Cost might be problem since “second league nations together spend approximately $300 million a year on space—an order of magnitude less than the United States and probably the Soviet Union.” (Gatland, Science Journal, 7/70,77-80)

Lord Ritchie-Calder wrote in Foreign Affairs: “Past civilizations are buried in the graveyards of their own mistakes, but as each died of its greed, its carelessness or its effeteness another took its place. That was because such civilizations took their character from a locality or region. Today ours is a global civilization; it is not bounded by the Tigris and the Euphrates nor even the Hellespont and the Indus; it is the whole world. Its planet has shrunk to a neighborhood round which a man-made satellite can patrol sixteen times a day, riding the gravitational fences of Man’s family estate. It is a community so interdependent that our mistakes are exaggerated on a world scale. ... Modern Man can outboast the Ancients, who in the arrogance of their material achievements built pyramids as the gravestones of their civilizations. We can blast our pyramids into space to orbit through all eternity round a planet which perished by our neglect.” (Foreign Affairs, 1/70,207-20)

First would be an unmanned flight boosted by two-stage Saturn V—only first and second stage, with third stage replaced by orbital workshop, now called Skylab. “It will be this country’s first orbital space station. Attached to this Skylab is an airlock module, and a multiple docking adapter, to which arriving command and service modules can dock for crew exchange. And ajso attached to it is the ATM.. .a manned solar observatory that will be serviced by the people living in the Skylab. One day after this Skylab has been launched into orbit and has deployed its solar panels, both on the ATM and the Skylab itself, it will be visited by a Saturn IB-launched command and service module, bringing the first crew complement of three. The command module will dock to the multiple docking adapter, the crew will slip through the docking adapter and the airlock, into the workshop. . . . And the men will stay up there for 28 days.” Crew would then “crawl back into their command module, detach.. .use the service module to deboost themselves, and the command module will reenter the ocean and make a normal Apollo landing. “About three months after the first flight, another flight will go up, and this time the crew stay.. .will be extended to 56 days. ... And finally, there will be a third revisit, again of 56 days, after which the third crew will descend. The Skylab will then go into storage and can potentially be reactivated any time thereafter if more revisits are planned.” Even without budget restraints, it would be “something like 1977 before we could have a [space] shuttle flying.” NASA was “in continuous touch with the Air Force” in space shuttle and space station field. “The armed forces. . .have the duty to look into everything that may have a defense aspect; and so it is entirely proper that they want to understand the ramifications of space.” (Transcript)

NASA launched Itos 1 Improved Tiros Operational Satellite into orbit to photograph the earth day and night and flight-qualify the spacecraft for use in the National Operational Meteorological Satellite System. Itos I would take night infrared pictures and transmit cloud-fop and surface temperatures. TV photos could be received by automatic picture transmission system stations. "Super-six" version of two-stage, long-tank Thor-Delta launch vehicle (at right)—thrust augmented for the first time by six soiid-fuel strap-on Castor rockets instead of. three—made its debut to orbit the spacecraft weighing more than twice as much as previous ros satellites. Before the launch, above, the spacecraft was photographed as it was prepared for mating to the Defta-N at the Western Test Range. Oscar V was launched pickaback for use by amateur radio operators at Melbourne University, Australia. Itos I was first in new series of operational meteorological satellites to be launched in joint NASA-ESSA program to replace tos satellites operating in National Operational Meteorological Satellite System. Itos I weighed 306 kg (675 lbs)—more than twice as much as previous TOS satellites—and carried both automatic picture transmission (apt) and advanced vidicon camera system (avcs) cameras, previously carried on separate missions. Satellite was boxshaped with three-panel solar array and had new “stabilite” three-axis stabilization system. Onboard experiments included two redundant avcs cameras for stored global cloud-cover data for remote readout; two redundant apt cameras for local readout of global cloud-cover data; redundant scanning radiometers for global cloud-cover data for remote and local readout, both day and night; flat-plate radiometer for data on global heat balance; and solar proton monitor for routine observation of solar flares. Spacecraft would more than double daily weather coverage possible from ESSA satellites already in orbit and give more effective coverage at less expense for longer time. Nighttime photo capability would provide cloud-cover photos night and day every 12 hrs; essa series provided one picture per day. Itos I was 19th spacecraft to be launched in nomss. First, Tiros I, had been launched April 1, 1960; last, Essa IX, had been launched Feb. 26, 1969. Itos I was funded by NASA except for meteorological sensors; ksc was responsible for launch operations and GSFC was responsible for Delta booster. Future itos spacecraft would be funded by essa and would be turned over to essa by NASA after postlaunch checkout. (NASA Proj Off ; NASA Release 70-2)

Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, addressed American Newspaper Publishers Assn, in New York: “Our mental concepts and life habits are Earth-oriented. The ability to go the Moon or Mars is regarded as something less than important, and this is only natural. But I am firmly convinced that the space program will prove to be one of the most important, creative, and beneficial to mankind ever undertaken by the United States. ... I think we must clearly establish in this new decade our goals and objectives as an agency first, and then define the hardware needed only after we know exactly where we are headed.” Hardware “on hand or that would be fine to develop” should not “tell us where we’re going.” (Text) U.S. detection in 1950s of Soviet radar three times size of football field was described before Association by Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., dod Director of Defense Research and Engineering: “It was so big that when we first found out about it we were hesitant even to identify it as a radar. Much later we learned that it was far too powerful for most of the applications we could imagine. Assuming it was a radar, many argued that it made sense only as part of a detection, tracking and control network for satellites. The non-radar proponents even tried to make it into such things as a space communications system. The location of the first such radar argued that. . .this equipment probably would form part of an abm system.” (Text)

Progress of Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp) was described in Astronautics & Aeronautics by essa scientist David S. Johnson. NASA’s Itos I, launched Jan. 23, was in sun-synchronous orbit. Operational sounding capability would be added to system in 1972.	Third-generation operational satellite was planned for 1975 launch. Synchronous Meteorological Satellite scheduled for 1972 launch would be operational prototype of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite that would complement Itos I. Initially, U.S. would keep one geostationary spacecraft operating continuously. It was hoped second would be launched before first garp global experiment scheduled for one-year period about 1976. France and Japan were considering synchronous satellites for first garp global experiment, esro and U.K. might build polar-orbit meteorological satellites for experiment. U.S.S.R. was operating meteorological satellites in quasi-polar orbit and was developing sounding instruments. Space-based observing system apparently would furnish major portion of data for garp global experiment, by which time “U.S. operational meteorological satellite system will approach the coverage needed, except for the four synchronous satellites. Promising signs of significant contributions towards these have come from other countries.” (A&A, 10/70, 28-32)

ComSatCorp had been “bouncing from one controversy to another” since its 1962 inception, Robert J. Samuelson said in Washington Post. “Last week it was the International Telephone and Telegraph World Communications, Inc., that asked the FCC to scrub the satellite launch. ITT argued that the Commission was favoring satellite communications over underseas cable systems. . .. Others share iTT’s irritation. The remaining communications carriers with cable interests. . .are similarly unhappy with their new satellite competitor.” ComSatCorp stock holders were displeased that company had yet to pay dividend. “Even foreign countries, which have benefited by Comsat’s experience in establishing an international satellite network now resent Comsat’s dominant position in that system.” But international satellite traffic had been growing at annual rate of 20%. With initial investment nearly completed, ComSatCorp’s operating revenues were rising rapidly. (WPost, 4/26/70, L3)

In international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched U.K.’s Skynet B military comsat for dod, Nato I military comsat for NATO, and Oscar V radio propagation satellite for U.S. and Australian amateur radio operators. Italian crew, trained by NASA, launched NASA’s Uhuru on NASA launch vehicle. U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreement was reached on procedure for joint efforts to design compatible rendezvous and docking systems for manned spacecraft. Since European Space Conference had indicated that major participation in U.S. space transportation program would probably mean end to Europa III launcher program funding, esc was assured U.S. would continue to make reimbursable launch services available for European payloads for peaceful purposes. Such participation was understood to mean at least 10% of developmental costs of space transportation system, or about $1 billion. During year NASA held briefings for U.N. Outer Space Committee and invited u.n. and specialized agencies to participate in International Workshop on Earth Resources Survey System in 1971. Discussions were held with Brazil, Canada, and Mexico on agreements to extend cooperation in earth resources area; experimenters from 28 countries signified intention to submit proposals to analyze data acquired by erts. Joint working group meetings were held in India and U.S. on satellite instructional TV experiment for ats-f. nasa and aid began 18-mo experimental project with Korea in application of aerospace technology to Korean economic problems.

Ofo Orbiting Frog Otolith and secondary payload, RM Radiation/Meteoroid satellite, were successfully launched by NASA from Wallops Station at 1:00 am est by four-stage Scout booster. Two spacecraft separated 9 min after launch and entered orbit with 528-km (328-mi) apogee, 299.7-km (186.4-mi) perigee, 92.8-min period, and 37.4° inclination. Countdown had been aborted five times since original August launch date because of bad weather, instrument malfunctions, and death of frogs. Primary objective of 132.5-kg (292-lb) Ofo was to obtain information on functioning and adaptability in weightlessness of vestibule, portion of inner ear which controlled balance, by studying two male bullfrogs (Rana castebianca) on board. Through microelectrodes surgically implanted in vestibular nerves leading from sensor cells in frogs’ otholiths, scientists would be able to study for the first time electrical response of otolith sensors under weightlessness and simulated gravity provided by centrifuge for at least three days. Frogs had been chosen for flight because their inner ear mechanism functioned similarly to man’s and because they were small and amphibious. Onboard spacecraft they were submerged in water with oxygen composition controlled by instruments. After several hours in orbit frogs were in good condition and spacecraft was transmitting data satisfactorily.	' Primary objective of 21-kg(46-lb) RMsatellite was to demonstrate feasibility and accuracy of advanced radiation dosimeter concept in space and to verify, in flight, operation of instruments to be used on long-duration flights to study meteoroids for at least three months.

Oran W. Nicks, NASA Acting Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, testified before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during NASA FY 1971 authorization hearings: Jet aircraft noise-reduction goals of NASA’s acoustically treated nacelle program had been achieved. McDonnell Douglas design modifying nacelles of DC-8 had reduced noise by 10.5 epndb with estimated 4.2% direct-operating-cost increase. Boeing design for 707 aircraft had reduced noise by 15.5 epndb with estimated 9.2% direct-operating-cost increase. Long-range approach to reducing jet transport noise was under way in quiet engine program, with quietness as design requirement for first time in aviation history. Quiet engine incorporating high bypass ratio, low-noise fan design, and sound attenuating ducts would be built by General Electric Co. Three lifting-body vehicles—USAF X-24A, NASA M2-F3, and NASA HL-10—were investigating low-speed flight problems to be encountered by space shuttle orbiter and booster in future and providing information on subsonic and transonic flying qualities. In human factors program, NASA was preparing life support systems for extended space missions. “Continuous testing of candidate sub-systems integrated into functional life support systems has been accomplished for up to 60 days. The space vehicle simulation.cham-bers employed. . .have accommodated four-man teams. A 90-day test with the four-man simulator will be conducted this year.” Test would include onboard oxygen recovery system with water electrolysis unit—major component in subsystem for oxygen recovery from carbon dioxide.

Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, aec Chairman, addressed Fourteenth General IAEA Conference in Vienna: “The industrial and technological advances being made in the world are creating increasing demands for electric power that is cheap, abundant, safe, reliable and clean. In my country, the estimated total electrical generating capacity for 1970 is about 300 000 megawatts. I believe that a realistic estimate of the projected growth of our electrical generating capacity by the year 2000 is about 2 100 000 megawatts, which will require adding the equivalent of a total of 1 800 power plants of 1000 megawatts capacity each.” On global scale, “some 5000 new electric generating plants of 1000 megawatts capacity each would be needed over the next 30 years.” (Text) Predominant theme of conference, was that reusable shuttles would substantially lessen cost of practical uses of space. There was little talk of manned space stations or exploration of other planets. Discussions centered on use of satellites for communications, air traffic control, and weather forecasting. European public had become “cool to manned space flight,” New York Times said. ESRO head, Dr. Herman Bondi, said at conference, “We have grown up with the impression that everything in space is devilishly expensive.” Belgian aerospace executive Maurice Desirant said European efforts at joint space programs had been handicapped by pressures to perform national feats. Now, however, European countries had become “more and more aware of the dangers.” They had seen money wasted on duplicated efforts which had achieved limited results. Lefevre said that, to be effective, European contribution to major space effort must be under leadership strong enough to override any differences arising from “divergent technical points of view, reasons of industrial competition, economic whims for national politics or finances.” NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers outlined shuttle plans. Payload of 22 680 kg (50 0OO lb) had been halved. (Sullivan, NYT, 9/23-24/70; NYT, 9/26/70, 11) September 23: Roy P.

Frutkin, NASA Assistant Administrator for International Affairs, described Brazilian proposal for educational broadcast experiment using NASA ATS-F or ATS-G satellite to House Committee on Foreign Affairs’ Subcommittee on National Security Policy and Scientific Development: “The project is intended ... as the development prototype of a system that will broadcast television and radio instructional material to the entire country through a government-owned geostationary satellite. The experiment itself contemplates TV and radio broadcasting into some 500 schools in the Rio Grande de Norte region. It would test the use of satellites for central broadcasting using a balance of TV and radio, to upgrade teacher quality, permit the use of local monitors with less training, and so facilitate rapid expansion of the educational system.” Proposal was undergoing revision before final technical evaluation by NASA.

George Washington Univ. published International Aspects of Earth Resources Survey Satellite Programs by John Hanessian, Jr., reprint of article published in Journal of the British Interplanetary Society: International participation in experimental earth resources survey satellite program was possible in several forms, each both advantageous and disadvantageous for U.S. and participating country. “The technical constraints and realistic expectations need to be carefully considered in any feasibility evaluation that may be carried out....” Technical assistance from industrialized countries or regional or international multilateral agencies would be necessary for developing countries. “It is also quite possible that private industry could play a leading role in such efforts.” Potential participation of U.S.S.R. “must be viewed not only with the optimism engendered by recent statements, but also by reflection on the experience of a decade of space history.” Survey satellite concept “could provide an ideal opportunity for the technologically advanced nations of the world to converge their interests with the aspirations of the many developing countries in their effort to build a just, peaceful, and economically progressive world community.” (Text)

American and British space experts believe that the Soviet Union has built and successfully tested a satellite capable of intercepting and destroying other orbiting spacecraft,” Richard D. Lyons reported in New York Times. Tracking data and intelligence reports suggested that U.S.S.R.’s Cosmos CCXLVIII(launched Oct. 19, 1968) had homed in on Cosmos CCXLIX (launched Oct. 20, 1968) and Cosmos CCLII (launched Nov. 1, 1968) and destroyed them. Air Force Aerospace Defense Command radar had monitored launches and orbits and later detected about 25 pieces of the two spacecraft, indicating explosions had occurred while they were near Cosmos CCXLVIII. usaf plans for orbital attack system code-named Saint (satellite inspection and interception satellite) prepared 11 yrs ago had been shelved, but were apparently being revived under new code name, Lyons said.

Analysis of photo of Phobos, largest of two Martian moons, taken 138 000 km (86 000 mi) from Mars by Mariner VII was discussed in Science by New Mexico State Univ. astronomer and Mariner project scientist Bradford A. Smith, jpl photo-enhancement techniques had indicated Phobos was nonspherical and was larger and had darker surface than previously thought. Satellite’s limb profile measured 18 by 22 km (11.2 by 13.7 mi) and was elongated along orbital plane. Phobos had average visual geometric albedo of 0.065, lower than that known for any other body in solar system. It seemed probable Phobos had not formed by accretion around primordial Mars, but was captured at some later time. (Science, 5/15/70, 828-30; NASA Release 70-66)

International reaction to first Chinese satellite launch: In U.S.S.R. Pravda devoted 10 words on inside page to report of launch. Washington Post said it was “continuation of a war of words”; Chinese had barely mentioned Soviet space activities since nations became enemies. Romania congratulated Chinese for “fresh successes in the field of scientific investigation of outer space.” Albania also hailed achievement. U.K. Minister of Technology Anthony Wedgwood Benn sent message to Chinese government congratulating engineers and space workers on launch. West Germany’s Bochum Observatory called event greater technological feat than 1957 launch of Soviet Sputnik I. North Vietnam news agency said launching “brings out the supremacy of socialism and contributes to the development of science and technology in the interests of progressive mankind.” Pakistan President Yahya Khan in message to Chinese Premier Chou En-lai called launch “great step forward,” demonstrating progress of China’s technology. He said feat “by our friendly neighbor has been received by us with a feeling of admiration.” Japanese officials said if China had developed guidance system for satellite launching, it soon would be able to fire intercontinental missiles with high precision.

NASA announced selection of 15 investigators and experiments for Atmosphere Explorer (ae) flights C, D, and E scheduled for launch in 1973, 1974, and 1975. Spacecraft would investigate atmosphere at altitudes between 120 and 150 km (75 and 95 mi). Region had not been investigated by satellites because air drag slowed satellites’ Eeriods and caused premature reentry. New ae spacecraft would ave onboard hydrazine propulsion systems that would overcome air drag and permit automated variable orbits. (NASA Release 70-29)
Sovetsky Voin in Moscow published article on conquering universe, by Soviet Academician Boris N. Petrov: “During the next few years’ studies of circumterrestrial space, the upper atmosphere and earth from space will undoubtedly develop further with the use of satellites with automatic instrumentation, periodically launched manned spaceships and large orbiting scientific stations operating for long periods and having a replaceable crew, as well as by sounding the atmosphere with geophysical rockets.” (jprs, 50505, 5/13/70, 53-4)
Air Force and Space Digest editorial by John L. Frisbee advocated “show and tell” method of alerting U.S. public to Soviet nuclear threat: “Today’s public skepticism about the realities of Soviet nuclear power, and its intended uses, is somewhat reminiscent of the skepticism that existed in the fall of 1962, concerning allegations of Soviet missile-site construction in Cuba. That earlier skepticism disappeared when photos of the Cuban missile sites, taken from high-flying U-2 aircraft, were made public.” One way to awaken U.S. public to current Soviet threat “might be to release some of the satellite photography on which US analysis of the threat is based.” (AF/SD, 8/70,8)
AT&T had urged FCC to adopt overseas communications policy that would permit building of 10 additional undersea cables by end of 1979, Wall Street Journal reported. Company had told FCC it did not object to fcc approval of pending applications for four additional satellites beyond four new ones already approved for launching, but asked that fcc also approve new cable projects “to avoid a serious imbalance between cable and satellite facilities in the future.” {WSJ, 8/21/70)
USNS Vanguard, seagoing tracking station of NASA Manned Space Flight Network, joined OSSA-GSFC-Wallops Station mapping expedition to measure cavity in ocean surface over deepest spot in Atlantic —five-mile-deep Puerto Rico Trench. Vanguard would sail across cavity making precise navigation and gravity measurements while its radar tracked NASA’s Geos II satellite orbiting overhead. Underwater transponders would provide local geodetic control point for referencing ship’s position in support of onboard navigation system. Purpose of mission was to provide calibration standard for altimeter planned for use aboard geos satellite scheduled for 1972 launch. (NASA Release 70-108)

Workshop would survey data already acquired and methods of collecting, processing, and analyzing earth resources data. Potential action for countries initiating earth resources programs would be discussed, including costs and opportunities for international cooperation and assistance. (NASA Release 70-215)
Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, reported on international cooperation in NASA programs before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: NASA had established “sound base of extensive and successful cooperation” with over 70 countries in 1960s, entered into almost 250 agreements for international space projects, orbited foreign satellites and flown foreign experiments on U.S. spacecraft, participated in more than 500 cooperative scientific rocket soundings from sites throughout world, involved more than 50 foreign scientists in analysis of lunar samples, and provided for direct daily reception by some 50 countries of data from weather satellites. “Third” countries together spent “roughly $300 million a year on space.” “On the aeronautics side of NASA’s responsibilities, cooperative projects with Canadian, French, German, and British agencies are contributing importantly to the development and testing of a variety of v/stol aircraft configurations.” In experimental meteorological satellite and balloon program, Project Eole, NASA would launch French satellite to track several hundred balloons to derive global circulation of winds. Cooperative earth resources survey projects had been undertaken with Brazil and Mexico to acquaint foreign scientists and policy makers with potential of remote sensing. NASA had added earth resources disciplines to international graduate fellowship program and planned international workshop in 1971. NASA was providing technical assistance to India in aircraft survey of coconut palm blight in Kerala State so that its spread could be controlled. Agency was considering proposal to launch French synchronous meteorological satellite as joint contribution to Global Atmospheric Research Program and had met informally with ESRO and European aviation officials to consider mission requirements for possible preoperational air-traffic-control satellite system for North Atlantic. Dr. Paine had written new letters to Soviet Academy of Sciences President Mstislav V. Keldysh and to Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov “inviting new initiatives in space cooperation.” Keldysh had accepted suggestion for meeting, but had deferred further discussion for “three or four months” from Dec. 12, 1969. Keldysh had declined invitation of Soviet proposals for experiments on NASA planetary probes, “advocating instead a relationship in which NASA and the Soviet Academy would coordinate ‘planetary goals’ and ‘exchange results’ of unmanned planetary investigations.” (Testimony)
