usaf communications and navigation satellite programs were outlined by l/g John W. O’Neill, Vice Commander of afsc, in TRW Space Log. afsc was testing new uhf communication terminal in conjunction with Tacsat I tactical comsat and had tested uhf shipboard, jeep, van-mounted, and team-pack terminals as receivers for satellite communications. Second-generation defense comsats would have earth coverage antennas and also steerable narrow-beam antennas to direct energy to two “spotlighted” areas on earth’s surface, permitting use of small terminals instead of large ground stations. Proposed navigation satellite system would consist of bigh-altitude satellites transmitting navigation signals with worldwide coverage, ground stations to track and command satellites, and user receiving equipment. Navsat would provide all four armed services with common grid for mobile operations and could be used by aircraft, ships, submarines, and foot soldiers. Potential for aircraft carrier operations was being studied. Computer revolution would provide new data processing equipment “with infinite potential for influencing satellite design and function” in future. “We are pressing hard for progress in laser technology, which appears to have excellent potential for communication applications. We are also pushing the development of new sources of power in space in which a breakaway from our heavy reliance upon the solar cell could make future satellite development a whole new game.” (TRW Space Log, Summer/Fall 69, 3—17)
Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe announced award of $279,032 contract to Control Data Corp. Melville Space and Defense Systems Div. for 22-mo study of pilot warning instrument (pwi) systems that would improve pilots’ ability to detect other aircraft in flight, (faa Release 69—126) 160.7-mi (258.6-km) perigee, 655.3-min period, and 27.6° inclination. Primary NASA objective was to place spacecraft into synchronous transfer orbit accurate enough for apogee motor to place spacecraft into synchronous equatorial orbit. On Nov. 23 apogee motor was fired and spacecraft entered circular orbit with 22,216.5-mi (35,746.4-km) apogee, 21,558.3-mi (34,687.3-km) perigee, 1,431-min period, 2.44° inclination, and 1.3° per day eastward orbital drift. Drift rate was increased to 8° per day to ensure arrival on station over Indian Ocean by Dec. 30. All systems except primary communications system had been turned on and were operating satisfactorily. Skynet A was first of two U.K. military comsats scheduled to be launched over Indian Ocean under dod—u.k. agreement, usaf managed project for dod and would reimburse NASA for launch services. U.K. would reimburse usaf. Skynet B would be launched in May 1970. Spacecraft consisted of two concentric cylinders containing apogee motor, solar cells, despun antenna, high-pressure hydrazine stabilization system, and redundant x-band communications system. It was 32 in high, 54 in in dia, and had five-year lifetime. Initial operation of spacecraft telemetry and command functions were performed from usaf satellite control facility. Control of orbital operations would be transferred to U.K. telemetry command facility after spacecraft reached station, (nasa Proj Off; SBD, 11/26/69, 114)
NASA’s Explorer XXXVIII (launched July 4, 1968), orbiting at 3,640-mi altitude, had discovered earth, like Jupiter, sporadically emitted low-frequency radio signals, Radio Astronomy Explorer project scientist Dr. Robert G. Stone told 1969 spring meeting of U.S. National Committee of International Union of Radio Science in Washington, D.C. “In the radio frequency range below 10 megahertz, the Earth looks very much like Jupiter. This suggests that the same processes that account for the Jovian radio noise may also be active in the Earth’s magnetosphere.” Signals from both planets appeared sharply beamed or directed in narrow cone, were quite intense and increased in intensity rapidly when observed toward lower frequencies, and were impulsive, occurring in rapid but sporadic bursts. Explorer XXXVlll also had revealed sun was more active source of radio outbursts in lower frequencies than expected, providing unique means of studying sun’s outer atmosphere to 36-million-mi distance of Mercury orbit. “Such information,” Stone said, “could shed further light on mystery of Sun’s part in cause of low frequency radio storms on the Earth.” Explorer XXXVIIFs four 750-ft-long antennas had provided most comprehensive and detailed measurements of cosmic radio noise at low frequencies yet available. Information was providing first low-frequency maps of radio emissions in Milky Way galaxy, showing that most radio emissions originated in plane or disc of Milky Way. Satellite had remained stable since orbit despite repeated movement and had continued to operate successfully. (NASA Release 69—57; AP, B Sun, 4/22/69, A6; O’Toole, W Post, 4/22/69, Al)

Intelsat conference of 67 countries and observers from Communist bloc and underdeveloped nations ended at State Dept, without agreement on method of sharing control over international satellite communications. Committee of Intelsat members was appointed to work through summer on alternate drafts of final agreement to be presented to conference in November. Leonard H. Marks, American chairman of conference, had announced his resignation and would return to private law practice in Washington, D.C. (Lydon, NYT, 3/23/69, 31; Rpt of US Del)
Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard announced cancellation by dod of Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) program because of “continuing urgency of reducing Federal defense spending” and “advances in automated techniques for unmanned satellite systems.” Cancellation would save “several hundred million” of $525 million proposed for MOL in FY 1970 budget authorization. Remainder would be needed for termination costs and USAF unmanned space programs. Cancellation also would save $1.5 billion in FY 1970 through 1974. Since 1965 initiation of mol program, dod had accumulated much experience in unmanned satellite systems and “profited from both manned and unmanned space exploration of NASA” for “the many, advanced technologies in the mol effort.” Some mol technology and hardware would be used in other DOD unmanned space programs and dod was exploring with NASA “the usefulness of some mol developments to NASA programs.” (dod Release 491—69)

In American Scholar architect R. Buckminster Fuller said: “It seems eminently clear that we not only must put our space programs on highest priority of attention and resource investment but that all humanity must be accredited and financed to enter into a new re-educational system that is geared to develop our most prominent awareness, that we indeed are in space and that all of our concern is with the fact that our space-vehicle Earth and its life-energy-giving Sun, and the tide-pumping Moon can provide ample sustenance and power for all humanity’s needs to be derived from our direct energy income without further robbing our fossil fuels energy savings account. In reality, the Sun, the Earth and the Moon are nothing else than a most fantastically well-designed and space-programmed team of vehicles. All of us are, always have been, and so long as we exist, always will be—nothing else but—astronauts. Let’s pull our heads out of the brain benumbing, mind frustrating, misinformedly conditioned reflexes. If it is going to be ‘All ashore who’s going ashore,’ once more intent to return to nonspace down here ON earth, humanity is doomed.” (American Scholar, Winter 1969-70, 27-47) During 1969: In 1969—the year man first set foot on another celestial body —U.S. orbited 54 spacecraft and U.S.S.R., 70. U.S. total included 31 orbited by DOD. NASA’s 23 included 2 satellites orbited for dod as secondary payloads. Highlight of 1969 was achievement of major goal in NASA’s Apollo program—to land man on the moon and return him safely to earth. Lunar landing system completed final phases of test and demonstration when Apollo 9 demonstrated operation of LM in earth orbit and Apollo 10 demonstrated operation of complete Apollo spacecraft in lunar orbit, with LM making two passes within 47,000 ft of lunar surface. Apollo program climaxed with Apollo 11, July 16—24, when LM Eagle landed on moon and Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. —first men on the moon—performed tasks on lunar surface, redocked with csm in lunar orbit, and returned safely to earth with lunar samples. Apollo 12 successfully accomplished second manned lunar landing with pinpoint accuracy, touching down close to Surveyor 111, which had landed on moon April 19, 1967. Crew set up first alsep on lunar surface and returned safely to earth with lunar samples and parts of Surveyor III. Unmanned Mariner VI and Mariner VII passed within 2,000 mi of Mars, transmitting more than 200 times more data about Mars than were obtained by Mariner IV in 1964. Spacecraft measured chemical composition and temperature of atmosphere and surface and took 198 high-quality pictures, providing new insight into Mars surface characteristics. Other scientific achievements included orbiting of Oso V, Oso VI, Ogo VI, and Explorer XL1. Applications satellites included Intelsat-Ill F—3, Intelsat-III F—4, and Intelsat-III F—5 for ComSat-Corp; Essa IX meteorological satellite for essa; Nimbus III; and Ats V. Biosatellite 111 provided significant biological data on instrumented monkey on board, but mission was terminated early after monkey’s physiological condition deteriorated, and monkey died shortly after recovery. Pioneer E, scheduled to enter solar orbit, and its secondary payload tetr—c were destroyed shortly after launch when Delta booster malfunctioned. Some 189 meteorological sounding rockets, 85 scientific sounding rockets, and 60 high-altitude balloons were launched. NASA—usaf XB—70 and X—15 programs were concluded and new joint program was initiated to continue aeronautical R&d, using YF—12 supersonic aircraft. First operational C—5A, military cargo transport and world’s largest aircraft, was delivered to usaf and by November seven C—5As had accumulated 1,320 hrs flying time. Aeronautical R&d continued to improve quality and quantity of options available in aircraft technology, and aircraft industry made first flights of several wide-bodied jumbo jet transports for civil use, including Boeing 747. New SST design with delta wing was approved by faa and prototype construction was recommended by President Nixon. NASA’s HL—10 lifting-body vehicle completed 3 successful glide flights and 15 powered flights included first supersonic flight at mach 1.1 and 54,000-ft altitude, usaf’s X—24A lifting-body vehicle completed 7 flights. dod space program included orbiting of 2 Vela nuclear-detection satellites, 7 Orbiting Vehicle research satellites, Tacsat I tactical comsat, Egrs XIII (Secor XIII) geodetic satellite (launched by NASA), and U.K.’s Skynet A comsat (launched by NASA). Titan HIM development was terminated and usaf’s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) program was canceled because of budget cutbacks. NASA and aec completed ground tests of xe experimental rocket engine with 28 successful startups and 2.8 hrs of operation, including 3.5	min at full thrust, and validated test stand No. 1 in Jackass Flats, Nev. SNAP—27 generator was used as electrical power source for Apollo 12 experiments left on moon and SNAP—19 was auxiliary power system for Nimbus III. SNAP—29 program was terminated. New liquid-propellant rocket engine was developed and new triprapellant system produced record performance for chemically powered engines. U.S.S.R.’s 70 payloads included 55 Cosmos satellites and 2 Intercosmos, 2 Meteor, 1 Luna, 1 Zond, 5 Soyuz, and 2 Venus spacecraft, and 2 Molniya I comsats. Manned Soyuz IV docked with manned Soyuz V and two cosmonauts transferred from Soyuz V to Soyuz IV before returning to earth. Manned Soyuz VI, VII, and VIII, launched on three successive days, rendezvoused in orbit and performed experiments including photography, communications, and welding. Luna XV, apparent unmanned challenger to NASA’s Apollo 11 for first lunar landing and return, crashed onto lunar surface in July. U.S.S.R.’s Tu-144 delta-wing supersonic transport successfully reached speeds up to 900 mph and was demonstrated publicly in 90-min test flight.

Tenth anniversary of DOD’s 1,450-lb Discoverer I satellite successfully launched into polar orbit by Thor-Agena booster. Tracking acquisition was hampered by stabilization difficulties and satellite reentered in early March 1959. Agena launch vehicle—most widely used booster in U.S.—had completed more than 250 successful flights in dod and NASA operations since its first mission Feb. 28,1958, and had carried first spacecraft to achieve circular orbit, first to be controlled in orbit by ground command, and first propelled from one orbit to another. It had been continually updated and used as versatile, multipurpose vehicle. (A&A 1915—60; Space Propulsion, 2/28/69, 199)

Expected decline followed increased operating expenses from expansion of satellite and earth station system. (ComSatCorp Release 69-18)
ComSatCorp announced broadcasters had booked 40 hrs of satellite time for TV coverage of President Nixon’s European trip Feb. 23—March 3. More than 17 hrs had been requested from abroad to date for coverage of Apollo 9 Feb. 28—March 3. (ComSatCorp Release 69-8; W Star, 2/16/69, C6)
Oao II (launched Dec. 7, 1968) completed 30 days of flight operation and was adjudged successful by NASA. Experiments had obtained 65 hrs of scientific data over range of eight magnitudes and 4,200 A—1,100 A wavelengths. Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory celescope experiment made 18 mappings and Univ. of Wisconsin experiment made detailed observations of 100 stars. Some 40,000 separate commands had been sent to Oao II and more than 4 million pieces of information had been collected, with 20 times more uv information from stars in 30 days than in 15 yrs of sounding rocket launchings. Satellite’s 11 telescopes were studying extremely young, hot stars which emitted most of their energy in uv portion of spectrum, not visible to ground observatories because of earth’s atmosphere, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 69—7)
ComSatCorp President Joseph V. Charyk told Annual Meeting of Shareholders in Washington, D.C., key goal of establishing global comsat system was “within immediate view.” When Early Bird [Intelsat /] “was launched just four years ago, there were only a handful of experimental stations in Europe and the United States. Today, there are 25 earth stations operating in 15 different countries of the world, with many more nearing completion. It is expected that a total of 43 stations will be in service by the end of this year and that 26 different countries will have direct access to all forms of high quality communications that the global system of satellites makes economically available to them.” By 1972 “there will be more than 70 stations operating in nearly 40 countries of the world, thereby making this high quality means of communications available directly to practically every nation on earth.” At end of first quarter of 1969 1,209 full-time circuits were being leased, up from 777 at end of 1967. Leased voice and record tariffs published by international carriers represented 40% reduction in Atlantic and Pacific areas since advent of comsats. Transmission of TV via satellite increased from 225 hrs in 1967 to 666 hrs in 1968, with 40% reduction in TV rates. (Text)
dod’s Tacsat 1 Tactical Communications Satellite was successfully launched from ETR at 4:09 pm est by Titan IIIC booster into synchronous equatorial orbit over Pacific.

Space program could provide tools and knowledge to help eliminate air pollution, NASC Executive Secretary William A. Anders, former Apollo 8 astronaut, said in speech before Governors’ Conference on California’s Changing Environment in Los Angeles. With remote sensors in aircraft “pilot can quickly and accurately map pollution levels over a wide area and range of altitudes.” Pollution map of entire U.S. could be generated each day. “Thus, aircraft and satellites with these remote sensors offer the unique advantage of being able to view large areas through new eyeballs very quickly and selectively. Further, by computer, the data can be reduced to formats that can be quickly and easily understood.” Aircraft and satellite surveys would provide “data which supplement surface techniques and which, in some cases, can’t be gathered in any other way.” Rather than fantastically expensive, satellite measurements could “be competitive with surface systems.” (Text)

In the photo the spacecraft teas prepared for launch on a four-stage Scout booster from the Western Test Range. jpl:	, the cities may benefit more from what’s happening right here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory than they do from what’s happening in some community action agency. Now, I’m not downgrading the need to work closely with people . . . but I think it would be a desperate mistake ... to adopt an attitude that we do not challenge the unknown, we do not move forward simply because we can’t predict what we’re going to find.” Columbus “didn’t find what he went for but he found something even better. Maybe that applies to the situation with regard to the ultimate goal . . . about landing a man on Mars. . . . we may do something a lot better.” In reply to question, he said: “We will never reach a point where we’ll have enough money for . . . the problems of the cities and of the population. . . . we could spend every resource we have and forego any scientific exploration and forget the need to research and develop new techniques. ... I suppose you come down to the final determination that you’ve got to put some of your effort in the future and not all of it in the present. And I don’t think the lack of a focus in the space program would be a benefit at all to the future of the cities and the problems you mention.” (Transcript)

Fewer launches will be required to keep the system in operation. The design allows for growth and the capacity to accommodate a variety of instruments to meet new and developing needs.” System would contain high-resolution infrared radiometer for “nighttime observations approaching daytime pictures in resolution and quality” thus providing 24-hr weather satellite coverage. “This step will enable us to meet fully the first national program objective—providing twice-daily observations of the entire earth, both by stored and direct readout systems, day and night.” (Text) Fifty years of transatlantic flight—from usn NC—4 flying boat’s Lisbon arrival May 27, 1919, to June 3, 1969, maiden Atlantic crossing of Boeing 747—was traced in paper by Dr. Richard K.

During “the Heroic Years on the North Atlantic between 27 May 1919 and 27 May 1939, there were 175 flights across the Atlantic; 142 were by airplanes, 33 by airships. ... It is confidently believed that all the persons who flew the Atlantic by airplane during that period could be accommodated aboard a 747, perhaps with some seats to spare. However, at least three more 747s would be required to lift those persons who flew by airship during 1919—1937!” (Text) msc Flight Operations Director Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., said Apollo program might be extended to 1973 to allow NASA to fly three space station training missions in 1972. “It’s going to be some time before we settle it. But it’s going to be difficult to handle both Apollo and Apollo Applications from an operational point of view as well as a people point of view in 1972.” Revised launch schedule set Apollo 19 landing back to November 1972 and Apollo 20 to May 1973. Between Apollo 18 launch Feb. 11, 1972, and Apollo 19 were three orbital flights preparatory for establishment of first U.S. permanent space station in 1975. These flights could come just after Apollo 18, in May 1972 and in September 1972. Further reason for Apollo landings delay was possibility they would be made in remote lunar areas like crater Tycho, almost 1,000 mi below moon’s equator and rated among top-priority landing sites. (O’Toole, W Post, 10/23/69, A21) Dr. Arthur D. Code, Univ. of Wisconsin astronomer, reported discovery that relatively young stars in constellations Orion and Scorpius were generating heats of 45,000°F—5,000° hotter than had been thought. Finding, from data obtained by NASA’s Oao II satellite (launched Dec. 7, 1968), suggested young stars might be more massive and maturing faster than originally believed and supported theories of thermonuclear processes in stars’ interiors that generated such heats. Oao II data also showed younger stars had more complex chemical composition than stars formed near universe’s beginning. They contained fairly large amounts of carbon, silicon, magnesium, and heavier elements, as well as predominant hydrogen and helium. Other Oao II data indicated particles in interstellar space were variety of complex matter, much of which might be debris ejected from stars. (Wilford, NYT, 10/21/69, C19) msc Director of Engineering Development Maxime A. Faget outlined concept of space vehicle with two reusable stages—booster rocket and orbiter craft—both with fixed wings, long fuselages, and rear rocket engines. Vehicle would be 225 ft high and weigh 2.5 million lbs at launch. Orbiter vehicle, capable of carrying 25,000 lbs of cargo and passengers, would be attached pickaback to booster stage’s upper half. Booster, burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, would elevate orbiter to fringe of space, separate, drop away, and cruise to landing like jet airliner. Booster probably would be piloted by two astronauts. Orbiter would ignite rocket engine to continue upward to space station orbiting at 300-mi altitude. After link-up with space station, transfer of cargo or 12 passengers, and pickup of new load, orbiter would be steered by pilot into atmosphere and controlled glide to landing on 10,000-ft runways used by aircraft. Key to reentry would be orbiter’s “angle of attack” when hitting atmosphere. Faget proposed 60° angle with nose up, so flattened bottom would catch airflow to slow descent. Small jet engines would be fired to help control final descent phases of both orbiter and booster. Outer surface of vehicles would be made of metal alloys that could sustain temperatures to 2,700°F. (Wilford, NYT, 10/24/69, 43) Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, discussed dod space activities: “In communications, meteorology and surveillance . . . we are actively pursuing increased capability. . . . Tactical communications using satellite relays are presently being intensely tested and show great promise in improving control of field units and increasing . . . cooperation between land, sea and air forces. In surveillance, our efforts have produced results. Of first importance is a new satellite early warning system that will do a great deal to further insure our ability to deter nuclear attack.” Savings in space travel costs “must be linked to the recovery and reuse of space vehicles. . . . Since major improvement in our ability to use space environment would be of direct assistance to both NASA and the military, we are jointly planning our research and development towards this objective.” (Text) Major aiaa awards presented included Louis W. Hill Space Transportation Award to George M. Low, former Manager of Apollo Spacecraft Program at msc, currently on special assignment to msc Director, for “his leadership role in bringing the Apollo Program to fulfillment, and to the thousands of engineers who dedicated their careers, without public recognition, to the conquest of space.” Daniel Guggenheim Medal for 1969 was presented to retired arc Director H. Julian Allen for “personal contributions to outstanding research and development leading to vastly improved re-entry bodies, missiles, satellites, and spacecraft, and for leadership in directing and inspiring a large group of research men at Ames Laboratory.” Lawrence Sperry Award was given Edgar C. Lineberry, Jr., Chief of Orbital Mission Analysis Branch, msc, for “significant advancement in the field of rendezvous mechanics through his development of the space maneuver logic and associated control techniques, and his formulation of the mission plans which contributed decisively to the success of all rendezvous operations conducted during United States manned space flights.” De Florez Training Award was given to Gifford Bull, Principal Engineer and Engineering Pilot at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, for “establishing the use of variable stability airplanes as flight dynamics training vehicles for engineering test pilots.” New aiaa Award for Spacecraft Design was awarded Otto E. Bartoe, Jr., Vice President, Aerospace Div., Ball Brothers Research Corp., for “concept and preliminary design of the Orbiting Solar Observatory spacecraft configuration and control systems, the first embodiment of the spin-despin design.” Aerospace Communications Award was awarded Dr. Eberhardt Rechtin, Director of DOD Advanced Research Projects Agency and former JPL Assistant Director for Tracking and Data Acquisition, for “development of phase lock systems for space communications, guidance and control, and for contributions to the design, development and operation of NASA’s Deep Space Network.” (msc Release; aiaa Releases; aiaa Booster, 10/20/69) Honored as new Honorary Fellows at Honors and Award Banquet Oct. 23 were Dr. Robert C.

NASA’s 148-lb drum-shaped Pioneer E failed on 5:29 pm edt launch from etr by Thrust-Augmented Improved Thor-Delta (DSV— 3L) booster. Satellite had been intended for solar orbit to collect scientific data on electromagnetic and plasma properties of interplanetary medium near earth’s orbital path during six or more passages of solar activity centers. Jettison of three strap-on solid-propellant rockets, lst-stage Thor engine cutoff, and 2nd-stage ignition occurred as planned but vehicle began gyrating, veered off course, and was destroyed by Range Safety Officer at 8 min 2 secs get. Pioneer E and tetr c test and training satellite, carried as secondary payload to test Apollo communications network, splashed into Atlantic about 300 mi southeast of Barbados. Preliminary analysis of data indicated loss of hydraulic pressure during lst-stage burn had permitted engine nozzle to develop uncontrolled gim-baling and vehicle gyrations. Investigation would be conducted to determine exact cause and action to prevent recurrence. Pioneer E was last in series of five spacecraft designed to provide continuing measurements over the solar cycle at widely separated points in interplanetary space. Pioneer VI (launched Dec. 16, 1965), Pioneer VII (launched Aug. 17, 1966), Pioneer VIII (launched Dec. 16, 1967), and Pioneer IX (launched Nov. 8, 1968) had received 25,000	commands from ground and were still producing useful data from widely scattered positions in heliocentric orbits. Most recent Pioneer missions had provided new information on functions of magnetosphere, additional data on finding that diffuse solar plasma regions appeared to have attraction of their own, measurements of cosmic dust populations, data on changes in electrical and magnetic characteristics of solar corona, and targets for precision radar tracking which led to establishment of reliable value for earth-moon-mass ratio and sun-earth-mass ratio. Pioneer program was managed by arc under OSSA direction. (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 69—116; SBD, 8/29/69, 213)

ComSatCorp submitted Report to the President and the Congress for the Calendar Year 1968. Highlights included completion of three new ground stations in U.S. and seven in foreign countries, successful launch and operation of Intelsat-III F-2 (Dec. 18, 1968), increase in intelsat membership to 63 nations, award of $72-million contract to Hughes Aircraft Co. for four Intelsat IV satellites, and phasing out of regular service of Intelsat I (Early Bird) after 42 mos of commercial service with 100% reliability. In 1968 ComSatCorp realized net income of $6,841,000 (68 cents per share), 47% increase over $4,638,000 ( 46 cents per share) earned in 1967. Revenues for 1968 totaled $30,495,000; they were $18,464,000 in 1967. Utilization of comsat system continued to increase, with ComSatCorp leasing 941 full-time circuits at end of 1968, up from 717 at end of 1967 and 73 at end of 1966. Demand for TV coverage of world news events increased, with 666 hrs of TV transmitted via satellite during 1968—nearly three times as many hours as in 1967. (Text; Annual Rpt to Shareholders)
German space program was described in International Science Notes published by Dept, of State. For 1969, German space budget was $88 million, with $51 million for national program and remainder for international programs. Amount was approximately 16.5% of total Science Ministry budget. During 1969 to 1973, program would be directed to extraterrestrial research, development of scientific and applications satellite technology (communications, TV, navigation, and meteorology) , and development of launcher technology in cooperation with other European countries. Plans included two German Azur research satellites to measure earth radiation belt and density composition of higher atmosphere, both to be launched by United States rockets; development of two solar probes (Helios) in cooperation with NASA; research comsat (Symphonie) to be developed with France; and participation in ESRO research programs and in development of eldo launcher.

NASA’s Oao II orbiting astronomical observatory (launched Dec. 7, 1968) refused to accept commands from NASA’s Santiago, Chile, tracking station. Satellite began tumbling out of control and its solar cells were unable to receive energy from sun to charge its batteries. While project officials tried to determine exact nature of anomaly, satellite recovered, accepting command from Australian station within few hours of battery depletion. Oao II was placed in sunbathing mode while batteries recharged. (Memo, NASA Asst Director for Projects; nasa Release 69—55)

Wearing 23-lb instrumentation around neck, elk was expected to migrate from point in Wyoming to national elk refuge south of Yellowstone Park at Jackson Hole, Wyo.—100-mi distance. (Teltsch, NYT, 10/5/69, 16) Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, gave Invited Lecture Oct. 6 on Apollo program, space benefits, Apollo Applications program, and lunar exploration. Apollo Applications program would “study the earth through the use of a six lens multispectral camera installation. On Apollo 9 some of the rudimentary work was done using four lenses. 50% more kinds of information will be brought back by the crews of Apollo Applications. Because almost everything on earth has a different reflective quality, as distinctive as a signature or a fingerprint, results from this photographic exploration can be expected to yield rich rewards. Many of the earth sciences look to this kind of information for answers to previously unanswerable questions. Hydrologists are interested in discovering not only the depth, but also the temperature of the waters of the world, and these conditions can be ascertained from space. Warm water attracts certain species of fish, so fishermen are also interested in these experiments. “Agronomists believe that soil chemistry will reveal itself on a large scale in certain kinds of filtered photography. Agriculturists know that different crops, at different stages of their development and in different states of health, reflect distinctive amounts of light. They hope, using the photographs we will take, to get some measure of the world’s crop, as well as some knowledge of its condition. Geologists, who have found clues to mineral deposits in the Gemini and Apollo pictures, look to this more sophisticated photography for additional information, and for distinctions which will eventually permit certain kinds of prospecting from space. Cartographers and Geodesists are interested in everything from urban sprawl to continental drift.” Sun would be prime target for exploration in Apollo Applications program, with experiments conducted by astronaut-astronomers using Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) in orbit. “For the first time we will have a massive set of instruments with high resolution for looking in some depth and detail at the activities of the sun from beyond the veil of the earth’s atmosphere.” Program would consist of three missions into near-earth space, one of 28 days and two of 56 days each. First step would be establishment of Saturn V workshop in orbit, planned for March 1972 launch, followed by launches of solar panels, ATM, and crew of three for 28-day stay. Second manned mission was scheduled for launch about three months after first, with third to follow one month after return of second crew. (Text)

nas published Plan for U.S. Participation in the Global Atmospheric Research Program. It recommended five-year effort including Pacific test of global weather observing system and large-scale atmospheric study in 1973, series of small regional studies beginning in 1969 or 1970, and experiments to improve numerical models of atmosphere for computer forecasting, with continued development of computer 100 times faster than currently available. Total effort would require 10 yrs, with plans for second portion to be based on information gained during first 5 yrs. Report, prepared by nrc committee, said developments in computers and satellites had made it possible “to advance toward the goal of accurate two-week forecasts and, eventually, toward intelligent modification of the weather.” Use of satellites such as Nimbus III, launched April 14, and expansion of other observing systems made it technically and economically possible to provide adequate global observations for long-range forecasts. Recommended test of global observing system would require 2 satellites with advanced instrumentation, nearly 1,000 balloons, and 135 instrumented buoys. Simultaneous cloud-cluster study would require 12 additional aircraft, several ground stations, and computer facility. Participating Government agencies would be responsible for determining program costs. (Text; NRC Release)

Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space had recommended new hj.N. initiatives to promote access to applications of space technology By small and nonspace powers, Richard S. Kahn said in Newsweek. Recommendations included appointment of U.N. official to serve as contact point for member states; panel meetings for promoting collaboration; U.N. assistance for survey missions, panel meetings, and fellowships; investigation of use of earth resource satellites; and dissemination of information on opportunities for education and training in space-related fields. Points of debate between large and small powers were on whether new technical assistance was required or whether existing machinery was sufficient. NASA Assistant Administrator for International Affairs Arnold W. Frutkin, as U.S. Representative on subcommittee, had observed that the “only two applications of space technology substantially available today are in . . . meteorology and communications, in both of which U.N. agencies are active.” (Newsweek, 5/26/69, 57—61)
nasc Executive Secretary William A. Anders, Apollo 8 astronaut, told Western Conference of Young Presidents’ Organization in Phoenix, Ariz., that U.S. lost $13 billion each year in agricultural production from insects, disease, and fire. Use of satellite sensors could improve surveys of agricultural and forest resources, aid mineral and petroleum prospecting, obtain better inventory of earth’s water sources, detect natural and man-made geography changes, sense ocean currents and temperatures to aid fishing industry and improve routing of commercial shipping, and study effects of environmental and water pollution. While NASA space expenditures were averaging about $4.5 billion annually— about 2/3 of 1% of GNP—nearly $4 billion was spent in U.S. for nondurable toys and sport supplies, $4.7 billion for foreign travel, and over $6.5 billion in amusements. Anders urged international harmony through space. “We travel through space on a small planet. The Earth looked so tiny in the heavens that there were times during the Apollo 8 mission when I had trouble finding it. If you can imagine yourself in a darkened room with only one clearly visible object, a small blue-green sphere about the size of a Christmas tree ornament, then you can begin to grasp what the Earth looks like from space. I think all of us subconsciously think the Earth is fiat or at least almost infinite. Let me assure you that, rather than a massive giant, it should be thought of more as the fragile Christmas tree ball which we should handle with considerable care. . . . From space, the earth is indivisible. There are no flags, no national boundaries. Let us on Earth then use the Communications Revolution to break down the barriers which separate us, so that all of Earth’s people will be truly brothers.” (CR, 10/6/69, E8190—2; nasc pio) *.

aiaa submitted to President Nixon’s Science Advisory Committee The Post-Apollo Space Program: An AIAA View. While “remarkable progress of the Apollo-Saturn lunar program has erased almost all doubt about man’s ability to travel in space and return safely,” program’s magnitude had overshadowed “very solid accomplishments” of unmanned satellites. It was based largely on technology available at its inception; neglected “growing accumulation of feasible, but undeveloped technology” in space vehicle design that could affect space transportation costs; and failed to specify goals beyond manned lunar landing. Report rejected single national space objective for next decade. It recommended programs to determine man’s usefulness in space over prolonged periods and to reduce cost of manned operations and urged Government to give high priority to multifaceted applications satellite program. It urged planning and funding for communications data relay, meteorology data, earth resources data, and navigational aids satellite programs and “well-integrated inter-agency plan to develop data-management subsystems.” aiaa considered Apollo Applications program and MOL of “substantially greater importance” than last four or five lunar landing missions and encouraged “their timely continuance.” It urged designs proceed for extensions of capability in aa and mol orbital hardware to permit continuation of manned orbital program after 1973, supported retention of at least one crew-carrying vehicle with increased capability for 1973—1975; encouraged early steps to commit to flight demonstration partially reusable low-cost space transportation system for 1974-1976; encouraged accelerated study of space station hardware to succeed aa program and MOL; and encouraged early steps toward commonality of NASA and DOD subsystems. It considered “commitment to an entirely new station” was “less urgent than commitment to a new logistics system.” aiaa recommended continued Apollo lunar program through at least two or three missions and then evaluation, as well as immediate beginning of “vigorous study and controlled funding” of advanced subsystems for 1973—1975 to permit continuation if early success provided support for extension. It recommended manned planetary exploration commitments await evaluation of current programs. Search for extraterrestrial life was “perhaps the most exciting and spectacular of all space-science program objectives” and might well serve as one of “central themes for set of balanced space goals for the 1970s.” ( a&a, 6/69, 39-46)

Pattern tied in, he said, with psychologists’ beliefs that only and eldest children tended to achieve more in life because they were disciplined more and trained and treated better by parents. Astronauts also were athletic, showed academic excellence, and had intense love of flying, O’Toole said. (W Post, 3/2/69) Primary objectives were to demonstrate crew, space vehicle, and mission support facilities performance during manned Saturn V mission with CSM and LM; demonstrate LM and crew performance, demonstrate performance of nominal and selected backup lunar orbit rendezvous (lor) mission activities; and assess CSm/lm consumables. Multispectral photography experiment was carried for first time to provide photos of earth resources using several different film-filter combinations. Launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft, carrying Astronauts James A. McDivitt (commander), David R. Scott (cm pilot), and Russell L. Schweickart (lm pilot), entered initial orbit with 119.5-mi (192.3-km) apogee and 117.6-rai (189,3-km) perigee. After post-insertion checkout csm, code-named “Gumdrop,” separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S—IVB) and lm, code-named “Spider.” Crew successfully transposed csm and docked with lm, and docked spacecraft was separated from 3rd stage with rcs burn. Two S—IVB burns placed stage on earth-escape trajectory. Crew conducted first docked SPS burn. On second day crew tracked landmarks, conducted pitch and yaw roll maneuvers, and increased apogee by firing sps engine three times. On third day, McDivitt and Schweickart entered lm through docking tunnel, evaluated lm systems, transmitted first telecast, and conducted first manned firing of lm descent propulsion system (dps). They then returned to csm and conducted fifth sps burn to circularize orbit. McDivitt and Schweickart reentered lm on fourth day and transmitted second telecast. Schweickart, recovered from earlier nausea, spent 37 min outside spacecraft, walking between lm and csm hatches, maneuvering on handrails, and standing in “golden slipper” foot restraints. He commented on sun’s brightness, photographed spacecraft and earth, and described rain squalls over ksc before he and McDivitt returned to csm. Scott opened cm hatch and retrieved thermal samples from csm exterior. McDivitt and Schweickart reentered lm on fifth day to perform csm—lm rendezvous. Scott separated csm from lm and fired csm reaction control system thrusters to place spacecraft about 3.4 mi (5.5 km) apart, lm dps was ignited twice to set up rendezvous, lm descent stage was jettisoned and LM ascent propulsion system (aps) was fired to set up conditions for circularization. Although problems were encountered with crewman optical alignment sight (coas) because of extremely bright reflections, radar and optical sightings backed up by earth tracking enabled spacecraft to dock successfully after being up to 114 mi (183.5 km) apart during 6%-hr separation. After McDivitt and Schweickart returned to csm, crew jettisoned lm ascent stage and maneuvered to safe distance while stage burned to propellant depletion and entered orbit with 4,309-mi (6,934.5-km) apogee and 142.2-mi (228.8-km) perigee. By end of fifth day 97% of Apollo 9 objectives had been successfully accomplished. On sixth through ninth days crew conducted sixth and seventh SPS burns to alter apogee, tracked NASA’s Pegasus III meteoroid detection satellite (launched July 30, 1965), took multispectral photos of earth, tracked landmarks, exercised spacecraft systems, and prepared for reentry. Final sps burn for deorbit on 10th day was delayed one revolution because of unfavorable weather in planned landing area, cm—sm separation, parachute deployment, and other reentry events were nominal; spacecraft reentered during 152nd revolution and splashed down in Atlantic 180 mi east of Bahamas at 12:53 pm est March 13, 241 hrs 53 secs after launch, within sight of recovery ship U.S.S. Guadalcanal. Crew was picked up by helicopter and flown to recovery ship within one hour after splashdown. Astronauts were welcomed by Guadalcanal crew and received congratulatory telegram message from President Nixon which said: “The epic flight of Apollo Nine will be recorded in history as ten days that thrilled the world. You have by your courage and your skill helped to shape the future of man in space. The three of you and the great team which enabled you to complete your successful mission have shown the world that the spirit of man and his technological genius are eager to begin an age of adventure, an age which will benefit all the people on this good earth.” All primary Apollo 9 objectives were achieved and anomalies were not serious enough to alter mission operations or flight plan significantly. First manned flight of lm qualified last major component for lunar landing mission. Apollo 9 was sixth Apollo mission to date and third manned Apollo mission. Earlier unmanned Apollo flights had yielded all spacecraft information possible without crew on board. Apollo 4 (launched Nov. 9, 1967) and Apollo 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1968) had both been highly successful, completing inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware. Apollo 6 (launched April 4, 1968), despite launch vehicle problems, had attained four of five primary objectives with spacecraft recovered in excellent condition. First manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7 (Oct. 11—22, 1968), had achieved all primary objectives and verified operation of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. Second manned mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21—27, 1968), proved capability of Apollo hardware and systems to operate out to lunar distances and return through earth’s atmosphere. Apollo program was directed by nasa Office of Manned Space Flight; msc was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, MSFC for Saturn V launch vehicle, and ksc for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by gsfc under overall direction of NASA Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Releases 69-29, 69-33; PD, 3/17/69, 400)
msfc announced award of $1,311,702 contract to LTV Aerospace Corp. for construction of temperature control devices for Apollo Telescope Mount, or manned solar observatory. msfc also had issued bid requests on 5 control relay packages, 4 horizon sensor scanner systems, 11 solar sensors (4 for attitude control system and 7 for solar panel control system), and 5 computer component control packages for guidance, control, and power systems for Saturn I Workshop, scheduled to be flown in 1971—72 in Apollo Applications Program, (msfc Releases 69—6, 69—8) Soyuz V, carrying Cosmonauts Yevegeny Khrunov, Boris Volynov, and Aleksey Yeliseyev, was launched Jan. 15 into orbit with 212-km (131.7-mi) apogee, 196-km (121.8-mi) perigee, 88.6-min period, and 51.7° inclination. Tass said spacecraft would conduct joint experiments with Soyuz IV. Spacecraft established radio contact, coordinated scientific programs, transmitted TV pictures to earth, photographed earth’s surface, and conducted midcourse maneuvers. On Jan, 16 the two spacecraft automatically approached to within 110 yds of each other and Soyuz IV was then steered manually until it docked with Soyuz V. Tass announcement said: “After the docking there was a mutual mechanical coupling of the ships, they were rigidly tightened up and their electrical circuits were connected. Thus, the world’s first experimental cosmic station with four compartments for the crew was assembled and began functioning as an artificial earth satellite.” Moscow TV viewers watched as Soyuz V crew members Khrunov and Yeliseyev put on special spacesuits with new regenerative life-support systems and went out into space through service compartment hatch. Cosmonauts remained in space for one hour, conducting observations and experiments, and then entered service compartment of other spacecraft, Soyuz IV, to join Shatalov, After 4 lirs 35 min of docked flight in low, nearly circular orbit, spacecraft were uncoupled and continued their flights separately. Soyuz IV, with three-man crew, landed Jan. 17 and Soyuz V, Jan. 18, (upi, W Star, 1/14—19/69; Shub, W Post, 1/15—19/69; Winters, B Sun, 1/15—18/69; Moscow News, 1/25—2/1/69, 3; 2/1—8/69, Supplement; gsfc SSR, 1/15/69; 1/31/69)

Dept, of Commerce, dod, Dept, of Interior, DOT, AEC, NASA, and nsf released News from BOMEX, report of Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment to be conducted in May, June, and July in cooperation with government of Barbados. Scientific study of joint behavior and interactions of atmosphere-ocean system in subtropical and tropical waters was part of Federal Air-Sea Interaction Research Program and major U.S. contribution to Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp). bomex would study continuous exchange of energy, momentum, gases, particulates, and electrical charges at air-sea interface and study ways in which energy and other properties were transported from area by atmosphere and ocean. NASA would test concepts of satellite sensors for weather and oceanographic observations. Its experimental weather and communications satellites (Ats III, Nimbus III, and essa satellites) and devices being developed under Earth Resources Survey Satellite program would be directly engaged in bomex. Photos taken by Apollo 9 astronauts with hand-held Hasselblad camera of 900 sq mi of equatorial Atlantic Ocean off Barbados would be used in project. (Text; NASA News; Science, 3/28/69, 1435-6)
NASA’s Nimbus 111 (Nimbus-B2) meteorological satellite was successfully launched from WTR by Long-Tank, Thrust-Augmented Thor (Thorad)-Agena D booster after three-day postponement because of fuel leak. Satellite entered orbit with 703-mi (1,131.1-km) apogee, 662.2-mi (1,065.5-km) perigee, 107.3-min period, and 80.1° inclination. Nimbus 111 carried usa’s Egrs XIII (also called Secor XIII) Sequential Collation of Range satellite as secondary payload on Agena 2nd stage and injected it into orbit with 704-mi (1,132.7-km) apogee, 667-mi (1,073.2-km) perigee, 107.3-min period, and 99.9° inclination. Primary objectives were to inject Nimbus 111 into orbit and demonstrate satisfactory operation of active, three-axis, earth-oriented spacecraft for at least three months and to acquire representative global samples of infrared spectra for vertical temperature profiles of atmosphere. As secondary objectives spacecraft would make global maps of radiative energy balance of earth atmosphere and cloud cover over at least one seasonal cycle; demonstrate feasibility of surface pressure and tropospheric wind measurements by infrared interferometer spectrometer system and temperature profile determination by infrared spectrometry; make global maps of earth and day-and-night cloud cover for three months from image-dissector camera system and high-resolution infrared radiometer; and demonstrate SNAP—19 system as auxiliary power system for three months. Spacecraft carried seven meteorological experiments—most ever carried on U.S. meteorological satellite—and was first capable of measuring emitted infrared energy that would permit inference of atmospheric profile on global basis. Interrogation, recording, and location system (1RLS) would pinpoint position of special electronic platforms on fixed land sites and moving objects such as buoys, balloons, aircraft, and elk in Yellowstone National Park. Butterfly-shaped 1,269-lb Nimbus III was fourth in series of seven spacecraft designed to develop significantly improved meteorological satellite, prove applicability of instrumentation, and fulfill special data requirements of atmospheric sciences research community. It was replacement for Nimbus B, which failed to enter orbit May 18, 1968, when launch vehicle malfunctioned. Nimbus I (launched Aug. 28, 1964) had operated for one month before solar-array drive system malfunctioned. Nimbus II (launched May 15, 1966) had exceeded six-month lifetime, operating successfully until Jan. 18, 1969. Nimbus program was managed by gsfc under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 69—50)
President Johnson sent $195.3-billion FY 1970 budget request to Congress, including total space budget of $5,946 billion. Of this sum, NASA would receive $3,599 billion (plus $7.89 million for aircraft technology and $117 million in unobligated funds from prior years to be applied to 1970 program); dod would receive $2,219 billion; aec, $105 million; essa, $10 million; nsf, $4 million; Dept, of Interior, $6 million; and Dept, of Agriculture, $4 million. Total NASA FY 1970 budget request of $3,878 billion was below $4 billion for first time since FY 1963 request. Expenditures were budgeted to decline nearly $300 million from FY 1969 level of $4,250 billion, to $3,950 billion. Of budget request, $3,168 billion would go for r&d, $58.2 million for construction of facilities, and $650.9 million for program management. Slightly more than 50% of total FY 1970 authority—$2,008 billion—would be in manned space flight, including Saturn IB Workshop and Apollo Telescope Mount. Space science and applications were allotted $558.8 million; advanced research and technology, $290.4 million. Larger proportion of NASA funds would go to research than to development in FY 1970 as Apollo costs declined. Increases would go to Apollo Applications (total $308.8 million in FY 1970), 1971 Mariner-Mars flight ($45.4 million), Viking project ($40 million), 1973 Mariner-Mercury ($3 million), Planetary Explorers ($8 million), Applications Technology Satellites ($44.2 million), and Earth Resources Survey program ($25.1 million). Aeronautical vehicle technology program, up from $74.9 million to $78.9 million, included $21.78 million for advanced research, $500,000 for general aviation, $11.25 million for v/stol, $16.19 million for subsonic aircraft, $20.9 million for supersonic aircraft, and $8.28 million for hypersonic aircraft. DOD space funding would include satellite development, certain portions of missile development and operating costs, mol (increased to $576 million), Titan III booster, and supporting R&D. In addition, aircraft r&d funds of $1.4 billion would include $500 million for new usn F—14A fighter to replace F—11 IB, $1 billion for series of advanced jet aircraft, $75 million for long-range bomber to succeed B—52, and funds for usaf F—15 fighter and usn vsx antisubmarine aircraft. aec space funding included amounts for nuclear rocket, propulsion technology and nuclear power sources for space applications, including production of isotopic fuels and aerospace safety. ESSA funds would support Earth Resources Technology Satellite (erts) program research. nsf’s total request was up from $400 million in FY 1969 to $497 million. Of this amount, its $4-million space funds were for research in astronomy using rockets and satellite-borne observation instruments. Dept, of Interior would conduct experiments with data from erts spacecraft. faa’s r&d budget would increase from $49 million in FY 1969 to $59 million in FY 1970. Principal increases were for research on air traffic control and noise abatement. President Johnson requested no additional funds for sst program, (nasa Release, 1/15/69; bob Special Analysis Q; Dale, NYT, 1/16/69, 1; Schmeck, NYT, 1/16/69, 24; Lindsey, NYT, 1/16/69, 81; W Post, 1/16/69, A12)
Press in U.S. and around the world underscored Apollo IPs landing on moon and man’s first steps on another planet. St. Louis Post-Dispatch: “There is no doubt that the United States should continue to support a substantial spacefaring program. Anything else would be a denial of the scientific spirit of the century and the qualities that have made America what it is. But its scope should be measured by findings and probabilities—and one other factor. Future spacefaring ought to be a co-operative effort of all nations able to participate, with the benefits to be shared by all.” (St. Louis P—D, 7/20/69) Washington Sunday Star: “A creature that can stand where Armstrong and Aldrin stand tonight—that can, in the future, move among the spheres and literally explore new worlds ... is unlikely to give up on the hard task of perfecting himself and his life in his natural environment on earth. The God who brought him thus far from a blob of squirming protoplasm ... is unlikely ... to let man blow it all now. Here . . . must be the answer to the national debate as to whether we go ahead in space, or whether we tend to our knitting at home. We are bound to do both. . . . The progressive expansion of the physical and spiritual domain of man inevitably will intensify our determination and ability, in concert with other nations, to build a home world where hunger, fear and violence no longer have a place.” (W Star, 7/20/69, Gl) William Hines in Washington Sunday Star: “One cannot question the majesty of conception or magnitude of effort that made Apollo 11 possible.” But one could ask, “Is this trip really necessary?” One saw in Apollo “that fundamental failing called hubris, which got so many protagonists into hot water in the old Greek mythology. Hubris in English is usually taken to mean prideful arrogance; in ancient Greek the word meant simple insolence. The Apollo enthusiast rejects the concept of hubris; he says we go to the moon not because we are arrogant, but because we are driven, and thereby implicitly rejects the concept of free will and substitutes sappiness for sassiness. The majority asks, ‘But if we didn’t go, what?’ and the minority responds, ‘If we didn’t go, so what?’” (W Star, 7/20/69, G2) Humorist Art Buchwald in Washington Post: “Sometimes one gets the feeling that the right hand germs in the Government don’t know what the left hand germs are doing. This was brought home to me . . . when I read about the millions of dollars that were being spent to see that the astronauts did not bring back a single germ from the moon. Unfortunately, across the page from that story was another that the Army was going ahead with open air testing of nerve gases and germ warfare.” (W Post, 7/20/69, B6) Los Angeles Herald-Examiner: “America’s moon program has benefited all mankind. It has brought better color television, water purification at less cost, new paints and plastics, improved weather forecasting, medicine, respirators, walkers for the handicapped, laser surgery, world-wide communications, new transportation systems, earthquake prediction system and solar power. . . . The Mars goal should bring benefits to all mankind even greater than the tremendous contributions of the moon program.” (LA Her-Exam, 7/20/69) Baltimore Sun: “. . . it is still almost incredible that in the afternoon of a Sunday on earth two humans found themselves within a vehicle resting on the surface of the moon. Nothing could quite prepare one’s mind for that, or for the subsequent moment of climax, the actual setting of a human foot on the substance of our barren satellite. One of the mysteries that had engaged the infinitely inquisitive mind of man is now made tangible. Others remain beyond our planet and upon it.” (B Sun, 7/21/69, A16) Chicago Daily News: “These have been moments to savor—moments in which uncounted millions have shared the immediacy of a turning point in history. This time there was no lapse of weeks or months, waiting for the event to be confirmed. We were all there, bound together by the miracle of communication that intertwined all the other miracles of technology that marked man’s first step on a celestial body.” (C Daily News, 7/21/69) Milwaukee Journal: “Superlatives pale before the magnificence of the achievement. . . . but how many years before the astounding performance of Armstrong and Aldrin will seem as primitive as the pioneering work of the Wright brothers?” (MJ, 7/21/69, 14) Cleveland Plain Dealer: “Man’s store of scientific knowledge will be vastly enriched by the landing on the moon. In no other single event in history has there been greater opportunity to unlock the mysteries of the universe.” (Plain Dealer, 7/21/69) London Daily Sketch: “America’s moon triumph offers this old world’s bickering and jealous people a parable of hope.” (B Sun, 7/22/69, Al) Montreal Star: “The deepest hope for a world starved for some form of symbolism, of an attempt at harmony in place of selfishness and narrow nationalism, came from the astronauts,” CFOX Radio, Montreal, broadcast. “Eliminate war? Yes! Eliminate poverty? Yes! But the exploration of space will help us, not impede us, in reaching these goals.” (Am Consul, Montreal) Arbetet, Malmo, Sweden (principal organ of Social Democratic Party): “No Soviet politician has ever before used such conciliatory tones toward the U.S.A. as did Foreign Minister Gromyko recently in his speech before the Supreme Soviet. . . . This Russian position seems generally to be based on fears of a confrontation with China. . . . One of the side effects can be increased Russian interest in broader scientific cooperation in space research. Nothing else could be better designed for global cooperation, since nothing else gives us clearer testimony that we live in one world.” (Am Embassy, Stockholm)

NASA released transcript of Jan. 14 briefing on NASA FY 1970 budget at which Dr. Thomas O. Paine, nasa Acting Administrator, said $3,878-billion budget approved by President Johnson had been developed “to maintain an austere but balanced NASA aeronautics and space program aimed at major program goals of high national priority.” Goals were continuing advances in space applications, including initiation of experimental earth resources technology satellites and slightly decelerated research on space environment; achieving manned lunar landing and additional Apollo moon missions, with limited provision for studies—not for development—of equipment to achieve longer lunar stay-times and mobility for future exploration; proceeding with Saturn I Workshop and Apollo Telescope Mount; proceeding with Viking Project to land instruments on Mars in 1973; initiating in FY 1970 Mariner flyby in 1973 of Venus and Mercury; producing family of small planetary Explorers for orbiting Mars and Venus; making preliminary observations of Jupiter with previously approved Pioneer spacecraft; continuing work on unmanned orbiting astronomical observatories; continuing advanced aerospace technology work at about current levels; emphasizing noise reduction, with construction of special noise research laboratory; developing full potential of civil and military aeronautics; and undertaking NERVA project for development of flight-weight nuclear engine. Dr. Paine noted FY 1970 budget, as approved by President Johnson, “would halt a four-year downward trend in NASA budget.” It was “austere and does not make full use of the aerospace capabilities that the nation has developed. . . .” But it permitted “a balanced program of useful work in critical areas.” Budget left “the major new program decisions, especially in the manned flight area, for the next Administration,” and was “ ‘holding budget’ that provides for progress, but defers critical program and funding decisions to the new Administration.” (Transcript)

Subcommittee on NASA Oversight submitted to House Committee on Science and Astronautics report Engineering Management of Design and Construction of Facilities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Report concluded that closer economic scrutiny of design and construction management at NASA executive level could “yield dividends in more efficient management and lower costs at the field centers.” Organization of Office of Facilities was “progressive step.” Cost accounting of administrative expenditures needed to be improved and engineering management costs should be clearly identified for all projects at all centers. (Text) Because of anomaly which required excessive fuel to maintain stable spin condition, apogee-kick motor was fired on first apogee instead of second and spacecraft had to be biased so it would drift from position over India to intended station over area west of Ecuador. Maneuver successfully placed Ats V into near-synchronous orbit with 22,927-mi (36,889.5-km) apogee, 22,221-mi (35,753.6-km) perigee, 1,464.0-min period, 2.7° inclination, and 6.9° per day westward drift. Active nutation control was overpowered by unidentified force that caused spacecraft to go into flat spin, preventing ejection of motor case without possibility of damage to spacecraft. Controllers were investigating alternatives—stopping spacecraft spin, restoring spacecraft to normal spin mode, or minimizing ejection hazard—which could be executed Aug. 25 when spacecraft became visible to Rosman, N.C., ground station. Spacecraft was not in danger thermally or electronically and was expected to become stable and operational after successful ejection of kick motor. Ats V was fifth in series of seven ATS satellites designed to investigate and flight-test technological developments common to number of satellite applications and useful to satellites operating in stationary orbits, conduct carefully instrumented gravity-gradient experiments for basic design information, and flight-test experiments peculiar to orbits of various missions. Ats I (launched Dec. 6, 1966) had exceeded test objectives and was still operating satisfactorily. Ats II (launched April 5, 1967), though judged a failure because of eccentric orbit, had transmitted some useful data before being turned off Oct. 23, 1967. Ats III (launched Nov. 5, 1967) had operated successfully and transmitted color photos of earth. Ats IV (launched Aug. 10, 1968) had remained in parking orbit when Centaur failed to complete second burn and had reentered Oct. 17, 1968. ats program was managed by gsfc under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off)

Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force and former NASA Associate and Deputy Administrator, delivered 1969 Minta Martin Lecture at MIT as 1968—69 Jerome Hunsaker Professor of Aeronau-• tical Engineering. Describing origins and development of U.S. space program as well as decision-making and implementation in commitment to manned lunar landing, paper would be presented also at Univ. of Maryland March 20 and at LeRC April 24. Citing need for set of national goals, Dr. Seamans defined national agenda for allocation of R&D that might be acceptable to man in street: understanding, forecasting, and controlling environment; supplying basic resources of food, fuel, minerals, and water; improving quality of life; improving transportation; improving communications; encouraging economic growth; and assisting international development and providing national security. Space program contributed to all categories. Studies of sun’s transmissions, of Mars and Venus atmospheres, of moon’s origin, and of earth itself contributed to understanding of environment for practical use of man. Space R&D might aid search for alternative basic resources; it could establish facilities for detecting available resources and speed communications to meet problems. Biological and medical investigations in space program held greatest promise in study of reactions of biological specimens, animals, and man. Impact on education had been cited by some as greatest value of space exploration. Program had required in-depth investigation of waste management, fire prevention, materials development, and microminiaturization. Space technology influenced new vehicles being tested for transportation—hydrofoil ships, surface-effect and air-cushion vehicles, high-speed trains, electric cars, vtol and v/stol aircraft, jumbo subsonic aircraft, and supersonic aircraft. Communications satellites, already in commercial use, ultimately could broadcast directly to home receivers. In international cooperation, NASA was working with 64 nations in space activity. Returns from NASA’s scientific satellites and communications satellites, development of manned space flight capability, and tracking facilities contributed to national defense. (Text)
New York Times editorial commented on Apollo 12: “It is almost incredible that such giant strides could have been made in the few months that separated Apollo 12 from Apollo 11.” Navigational capabilities available to Neil Armstrong last July were “so inexact that for days or weeks after his landing there was no certainty even as to just where Eagle had touched down. Intrepid, on the contrary, landed within a few hundred feet of Surveyor 3, the prime target of its crew’s planned collection activities. It will take months, perhaps years, to harvest the full scientific gains from Apollo 12. Already, however, it is evident that mankind is still at the stage where the more it learns about the moon, the more mysterious and puzzling that natural satellite appears to be.” (NYT, 11/23/69, 12)
Canadian Isis I (isis—a) International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies was successfully launched by NASA from wtr by three-stage Thrust-Augmented Improved Thor-Delta (DSV—3E) booster. Satellite entered orbit with 2,188.5-mi	(3,522-km) apogee, 356.7-mi (574-km) perigee, 128.3-min period, and 88.4° inclination. Primary NASA objectives were to place Isis I into elliptical earth orbit that would permit study of topside of ionosphere above electron peak of F region and to extend cooperative Canadian-U.S. program of ionospheric studies initiated by Alouette I (launched Sept. 28, 1962) by combining sounder data with correlative direct measurements for time sufficient to cover latitudinal and diurnal variations during high solar activity. Third in series of five satellites to improve understanding of ionospheric physics, Isis I weighed 520 lbs and carried six Canadian and four American experiments. First launch in series (isis x project, Nov. 28, 1965) orbited Canada’s Alouette II and U.S. Explorer XXXI. isis program was joint undertaking of NASA and Canadian Defence Research Board (drb) under December 1963 Memorandum of Understanding. drb was responsible for spacecraft design, fabrication, electrical testing, experiment integration, and satellite control. NASA provided launch vehicles, launch facilities. (NASA Proj Off; nasa Releases 69—14, 69—22)

Cancellation of mol program had left usaf with $1 billion in space hardware and 14 highly trained astronauts, Ralph Dighton of Associated Press wrote. Most of $1 billion already spent on program had been for undisclosed number of Titan HIM boosters and satellites built or on order, usaf had said launch facilities would be finished on schedule in September because they would have to be paid for anyway. They could be used for unmanned spacecraft. The $1.3-million mol administration building at Vandenberg afb, Calif., and $1.6-million medical and training structure could be adapted for office space, mol astronauts had been offered to NASA but no decision had yet been reached. Aerospace workers in seven firms had been hit by mol cancellation, with McDonnell Douglas Corp. most affected. It had 7,200 employees on project. (AP, W Star, 6/21/69, A5)
NASA announced selection of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and North American Rockwell Corp.’s Space Div. to conduct parallel $2.9-million, 11-mo design and planning studies of 12-man earth orbital space station which could be developed by 1975 and have 10-yr lifetime. Companies would also include conceptual design of 50-man space base composed of specialized modules assembled in low earth orbit in late 1970s and early 1980s to serve as centralized scientific and technical facility in orbit. Aerojet-General Corp., General Electric Co., and Hughes Aircraft Co. had been selected for final competitive negotiation of contract to develop advanced optical communications experiment. Companies would compete for one $5-million contract to develop wideband laser communications system to be placed on board Applications Technology Satellite ATS—F, scheduled for launch in 1972, for communications between satellite and transportable ground station.

Discovery of x-ray “star” between constellations Centaurus and Lupus from data relayed during July by two Vela nuclear detection satellites launched May 23 had been announced by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory astronomers, New York Times reported. Dr. J. P. Conner, Dr. W. D. Evans, and R. D. Helian said object had twice the intensity of most brilliant x-ray sources previously known-—in constellation Scor-pius—and had not yet been identified in wavelengths observable by human eye. No obvious source of x-ray emissions had been identified, such as stars, stellar explosions, or pulsars. (Sullivan, NYT, 8/14/69,
End of era in satellite watching would come with discontinuation in June 1970 of Smithsonian Institution’s optical tracking program, John Lannan said in Washington Evening Star. NASA already was terminating 10-yr support of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s efforts at Cambridge, Mass. Optical tracking had cost $4 million annually since 1958, first through nsf, then NASA. Program had led to nationwide “Dial-A-Satellite” telephone net by which tape-recorded messages told callers where satellites could be seen in sky. Service had become “Dial-A-Phenomenon” to note ecological, geophysical, and astronomical events, since decay of only visible satellites, Echo 1 and Echo II. Smithsonian Observatory had watched satellites with worldwide battery of Baker-Nunn cameras, which had been phased out except for observing maneuvers in major space flights. Observatory’s geodetic program was being expanded, with two lasers operational, one on Mount -Hopkins, Ariz., the other in Athens, Greece, but financial support had been halved for current fiscal year and would be cut to $1.3 million in 1971.

Science magazine published letter from Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.), Chairman of Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, clarifying his views on cost effectiveness evaluation of Earth Resources Satellite system. He reiterated opinion he stated in Dec. 1968 Earth Resources Satellite System report: “Precise determination of cost effectiveness at this early stage ... is not possible. . . . The magnitude of the economic benefits simply cannot be calculated in the absence of the type of data which the system is designed to produce.” Conclusions of studies already completed had constituted “strong evidence that precision was not possible. Yet, I am reassured by the fact that all such studies . . . have concluded that the potential economic benefits will exceed the costs of such a system by a substantial margin and some predict that benefits will someday .be measured in billions of dollars annually. It is my personal conviction that an operational ers system will ultimately prove highly cost-effective.” Karth said he considered it “nasa’s responsibility to experiment with new space systems that appear to have potential, and to conduct the necessary research and development which will lead to a firm foundation for a subsequent determination as to whether operational systems should be built. In this context, I believe cost effectiveness is not an appropriate standard to apply in advance to NASA’s experimental work, though it is certainly applicable when the time comes to decide whether to go forward with an operational system.” (Science, 5/30/69, 1009)
Project research method of supporting principal investigators’ research within universities accounted for about 70% of NASA funds obligated to universities and was serving NASA and schools well, Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said in speech at Ohio State Univ. More than 10% of project research support funds had been invested in equipment in university laboratories for continuing education and research. “More than 90% of balloon borne experiments, more than 40% of sounding rocket experiments, and more than 50% of satellite experiments flown On NASA vehicles had principal investigators or co-investigators in our universities. A large share of the significant discoveries in space science were made in university originated experiments.” NASA “supports about 13,000 project oriented research grants and contracts in universities . . . [and] 32 universities in 21 states are now working with NASA on various aspects of the earth resources satellite program.” (Text)

New York Times editorial: “Apollo 12 must not be taken for granted. It is another extremely important step in man’s exploration of earth’s natural satellite, a venture accompanied by great risk yet promising large rewards in additional knowledge. The mere fact that the Apollo 12 astronauts are scheduled to spend almost three times as long walking on the moon as their predecessors and to bring back to earth part of Surveyor 3—which landed in 1967—emphasizes how much more complex and ambitious this mission is.” Second moon landing might seem less glamorous than first, “but it requires great bravery and skill from all involved, and, if successful, could move lunar science ahead substantially.” (NYT, 11/9/69, 14)

Boreas (Esro IB) satellite—designed, developed, and constructed by European Space Research. Organization—was successfully launched by NASA from wtr by Scout booster. Orbital parameters: apogee, 237.4 mi (382 km); perigee, 180.8 mi (291 km); period, 91.3 min; and inclination, 85.1°. Primary NASA mission objectives were to place Boreas into planned orbit and provide tracking and telemetry support. Boreas was backup for and identical to Aurorae (Esro I A) successfully launched by NASA Oct. 3, 1968. It carried eight experiments to study aurora borealis (Northern Lights) and related phenomena of polar ionosphere, representing six organizations from U.K., Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Boreas was third successful esro satellite launched by NASA. First success, Iris I (Esro 1IB), had been launched by NASA May 16, 1968, to replace esro iia, which had failed to enter orbit May 29, 1967. esro was responsible for experiment instrumentation, delivery of spacecraft to launch site, equipment and personnel necessary to mate spacecraft to launch vehicle, and spacecraft testing.

l/g Ira C. Eaker (usaf, Ret.) criticized mol cancellation in Detroit News: Although 80% of U.S. space budget had been devoted to peaceful purposes in space, “it has been recognized generally that prudence dictated that we should ultimately possess the capability of intercepting, inspecting and, if need be, destroying hostile weapons in space. . . . Cancellation of the mol project concedes to the Russians control of space. After about 1972 the Russians will have the capability of overhauling and destroying our reconnaissance satellites, and they will also be capable of placing weapons in space which we can neither intercept, identify nor disarm.” (Detroit News, 6/30/69)

In Science, Walter Orr Roberts, President of University Corp. for Atmospheric Research, wrote: “Manned exploration of the moon will provide answers to age-long speculation about its nature. Perhaps even more important than what we find will be the fact that we have done it. The event will mark the successful attainment of a goal that demanded technological attainments of unprecedented complexity and difficulty. Our sights were set upon this goal nearly a decade ago by President Kennedy. I was, I confess, one who feared he had asked the impossible.” Weather forecasting—one example of earth-oriented use of space science—would require space satellites of new and sophisticated character. “We will not solve this problem unless we can somehow inspire atmospheric scientists of all the world to commit themselves to the goal. . . . Space technology is perhaps the most important single component of the technology development needed for success. What better use could be found for our incredible talents in space? After the moon, the earth!” (Science, 2/7/69)
INTELSAT conference ended March 21 had made it clear “that Intelsat, in its brief 5-year history, has been an extraordinary success,” wrote Robert J. Samuelson in Science. Its transoceanic satellites, transmitting telephone signals primarily, had tended to depress cost of communications by multiplying available channels and pressuring carriers to lower rates. Satellites had given “third world” nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, previously dependent upon “confused mixture of radio and cable channels,” chance to join advanced world’s communications system. Attendance of U.S.S.R. as conference observer was “sure sign” of INTELSAT success. Soviet decision to join Intelsat might hinge on organization’s decision about its future. Issue was Intelsat’s formal structure and problem was “determining how large a role the United States should play.” U.S. domination stemmed from its economic and technological power. U.S. firm, ComSatCorp, was made manager of Intelsat under 1964 agreement, to oversee satellite design, contract with NASA for launchings, and supervise operation in space. Month-long meeting had not resulted in accord on even draft agreement. Europeans wanted to replace ComSatCorp management with international secretariat to subcontract technical tasks to ComSatCorp and other organizations as they demonstrated genuine competence. U.S. approach was, Why “tamper with a successful formula?” Fundamental issue lay deeper. “Technological superiority . . . creates its own foreign policy problems. America’s Intelsat partners are pushing for a Space Age which—if not truly international—is at least more multinational.” (Science, 4/4/69, 56—7)

In New York Times Magazine, Dr. Ralph E. Lapp, physicist, wrote: “. . . I would urge that we alter the U.S. space program as follows: First, make a firm decision to terminate the manned space program soon after the initial lunar landing. ... I would reserve the remaining Apollo craft for future unmanned missions to the planets and I would mothball the single-purpose manned space flight facilities. At the same time, I would continue a n.a.S.a. program of long-range space development aimed at advanced modes of propulsion, compact energy sources and improved long-distance communication. High priority would be assigned to the development of nuclear energy both for propulsion and for on-board power. “Second, greatly expand n.a.s.a.’s present program for exploiting applications of space science and technology. The potential of satellites for communications . . . needs to be enhanced by the development of new techniques. It should not be too difficult to develop orbital systems for the control of intercontinental air traffic. Perhaps the greatest benefits from satellites are to be expected in the survey and evaluation of earth resources, such as underground water, mineral deposits and plant-forest cover. . . . “Third, establish a high priority within n.a.S.a. for fundamental research using unmanned space vehicles ... 10 to 20 years in duration and . . . aimed at finding out more about our planet, the sun and the rest of the solar system. The most expensive—and probably the most dramatic—of these projects would be the planetary probes designed to fly by, orbit or land on the nearby planets.” (NYT, 2/2/69, 32—40)
Space shuttle was “first step or keystone to the success and growth of future space flight developments for the exploration and exploitation of space,” LeRoy E. Day and B. G. Noblitt of Space Shuttle Task Group, NASA OMSF, said in paper presented at IEEE EASCON Session on Earth Orbiting Manned Space Station in Washington, D.C. “Large experiment modules and unmanned satellites can be placed into low earth orbit and retrieved as desired. Propulsive stages and payloads . . . destined for higher energy orbits can be placed into low earth orbits.” On-orbit reusable shuttles like space tugs and nuclear stages “become economically advantageous once propellants can be inexpensively delivered to earth orbit. . . . On-orbit maintenance services can be provided for malfunctioning or inoperative satellites. . . . short duration special purpose orbital missions can be conducted by the space shuttle itself to augment or complement space station activities. The design and operational characteristics of the space shuttle will also provide a potential capability to conduct space rescue missions—a capability that is not practical with conventional expendable launch systems,” (Text)

Temperature measurements from satellite soundings had proved so valuable they were being used to prepare basic maps of Northern Hemisphere weather, essa announced. Soundings, made by 91-lb satellite infrared spectrometer (sirs) on board NASA’s Nimbus III (launched April 14), had provided unprecedented coverage of conditions over oceans and other areas where few upper-air measurements were made. Use of sirs data had proved so successful that special computer-to-computer link had been installed between gsfc and National Meteorological Center in Suitland, Md., to permit regular use of data in analyses of weather conditions over eastern Atlantic and most of Pacific from surface to 53,000—ft altitude.

With encouragement from President Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, NASA had “begun drumming up pressure for the huge sums required to send men to Mars in the early 1980’s,” New York Times editorial said. “But the latest Mariner information makes the probability of life on Mars much less than it seemed even a week ago, thus removing much of the original motivation for such a project.

Economist said of Soviet Soyuz “fiasco” U.S.S.R. had tried “highly ambitious link-up of the components of a permanent, orbiting space station, something the Americans will be in no shape to do for perhaps five years. The fact that the Russians apparently failed must have been humiliating to them, and gratifying to the Americans, but it is unlikely to be more than a temporary check to a programme that has rolled with considerable success since the Russians put the world’s first satellite in orbit more than a decade ago. The slow progress reflects the state of Soviet industry, but is steady progress with few loose ends. The American programme, trimmed and squeezed by political pressure and public opinion, is trailing appreciably more loose ends; despite the victory on the moon Nasa will have to set about tidying them up. And it is then that the Russians will have the last laugh.” (Economist, 10/25/69, 20)

NASA successfully launched Essa IX (tos-g) ninth meteorological satellite in essa’s Tiros Operational Satellite (tos) system from etr by three-stage Thrust-Augmented Thor-Delta (DSV-3E) booster. Primary NASA mission objective was to place and operate spacecraft in sun-synchronous orbit with local equator crossing time between 2:15 pm and 2:35 pm so that daily advanced-vidicon-camera-system (Avcs) pictures of entire globe could be obtained regularly and dependably. Satellite achieved nearly polar, sun-synchronous, circular orbit with 934.6-mi (1,503.8-km) apogee, 884.4-mi (1,423.9-km) perigee, 115.2min period, and 101.8° inclination. An advanced version of cartwheel configuration, 320-lb cylindrical Essa IX carried flat plate radiometer to measure atmosphere’s heat balance and two avcs cameras for daily global weather coverage. Photos would be stored on board satellite on magnetic tape until readout by essa’s Command and Data Acquisition (cda) stations at Fairbanks, Alaska, and Wallops Island, Va. Satellite was backup to ensure full coverage after failure of one avcs camera on Essa VII (launched Aug. 16, 1968) and would be primary stored-data satellite in TOS system. Spacecraft was placed in wheel mode and spin rate was adjusted. Only anomaly was 20 rpm spin rate (rather than expected 10 rpm) after spacecraft spin-down. ESSA financed and managed TOS system and would operate spacecraft after NASA completed checkout in month. GSFC was responsible for procurement, launch, and initial checkout of spacecraft in orbit.

Briefing on Apollo 9’s earth resources survey experiment [see March 3— 13]	was held at NASA Hq. Dr. Leonard Jaffe, Director of Space Applications Programs, stressed importance of satellite photos for earth resources program: “. . . we have taken advantage of the Apollo and Gemini, as we did with Mercury, opportunities to get pictures of the earth and its environment with cameras, largely held by hand, by the astronauts. These pictures have been a very large source of experimental data for our Earth Resources Survey Program.” Advantage of using space for earth resources survey was twofold. One was “large view that it gives you of the earth.” Second was “ability to see the same phenomenon, or the same area of the earth time and time again, to be able to arrive over this particular spot on the earth periodically and observe temporal changes.” Apollo 9 experiment had obtained some 120 or 130 useful frames of multispectral data, all of which had been distributed to principal investigators for analysis.

NAS published NRC Div. of Engineering’s Useful Applications of Earth-Oriented Satellites, Report of the Central Review Committee of NRC Summer Study on Space Applications, prepared for NASA. Study concluded that space applications program was “too small by a factor of two or three.” Benefits from program were expected to be large, “certainly larger than the costs of achieving them.” However, “an extensive, coherent, and selective program” would be required to achieve benefits. Committee recommended that NASA give greater emphasis to earth-satellite programs with promise of beneficial applications, commit additional funds to expanded R&D and prototype operations for certain applications, and commit $200 million to $300 million yearly to space applications program. Manned space programs should be justified in their own right, not in terms of space applications; near-term benefits for mankind would be achieved “more effectively and economically with automated devices and vehicles.” Noting that in meteorology and communications “satellites have already entered solidly into the area of economic usefulness,” report recommended that NASA grant high priority to development of multichannel distribution system for public and private network TV; multichannel system for educational broadcasts in developing countries and for special interest groups such as physicians, lawyers, and educators; and North Atlantic satellite navigation system for traffic control of transoceanic aircraft and ships. Satellite earth-sensing was dependent on R&D in sensor signatures—form of information provided by instruments. Report recommended immediate pilot program for providing information in familiar and immediately usable form, exploration into use of side-looking radar, and start of 10- to 12-yr development plan for more sophisticated sensors.

Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, discussed need for improved manned bomber at joint national meeting of American Astronautical Society and Operations Research Society of America, in . Denver, Colo.: “Those who criticize the bomber as an obsolete system in the missile age are often the same people who refer to our alleged 4-to-l superiority over the Soviets in individually targeted warheads.” Ratio would be “nearly 1-to-l, with total payload running heavily against us, if it were not for our bomber force with its multiple weapons on each aircraft. If our bombers are to continue to provide deterrence, they must be able to survive an attack and then penetrate the ever-improving Soviet defenses. The B—52 is still a good aircraft, but the prototype was flying in 1952 and ths latest models were produced in 1962. An advanced bomber will take advantage of the many improvements that have been made in airframe and engine design. It would have short take-off and landing capability needed for dispersal and payload, structure, and speed necessary for penetration.” In security terms, space age presented dangers, but also afforded opportunities for increasing strategic stability. “Each generation of space vehicles will provide additional improvements in our ability to monitor enemy activities. We are now working on a satellite early warning system that would detect missiles as they are launched from land or sea. With the aid of such a warning system a dispersed bomber force would be able to take off from its bases before the impact of enemy weapons, even if the time of flight of the latter were greatly reduced.” (Text)

Soviet Academy of Sciences President, Prof. Mstislav V. Keldysh, said in Stockholm, “We no longer have any time plan for manned moon trips. Right now we are concentrating on constructing big satellite space stations.” He predicted expanded scientific cooperation between U.S. and U.S.S.R. with possibility of cosmonauts and astronauts aboard same spacecraft in future. In Sweden for Swedish Academy of Engineering’s 50th anniversary, Prof. Keldysh implied U.S.S.R. planned to assemble spacecraft in orbiting stations and launch them from there. He indicated existence of conflicting views in U.S.S.R. as to space research funding. “My personal view is that, when man has taken his first step into space, you cannot stop further development.” (upi, W Post, 10/25/69, A3)
NASA Acting Administrator, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, testifying before House Committee on Science and Astronautics on NASA FY 1970 authorization request, outlined goals in space and aeronautics toward which U.S. should move in next decade: “First—We should do all we can to understand and put into early use the promise of space for people here on earth. We should increase our scientific knowledge of the vital earth-sun relationship and study the earth itself from space. We should develop and experiment with new and improved practical applications of satellites, particularly in earth resources. We should continue to foster prompt introduction into the economy of space applications and technology. “Second—We should follow up the first Apollo landing with a sound program of manned lunar exploration. “Third—We should proceed with the development and experimental operation of a permanent U.S. space station in earth orbit. “Fourth—We should move out steadily in the exploration of deeper space, exploring the planets with unmanned probes and the sun, stars, and galaxies from orbital observatories outside the atmosphere. “Fifth—We should provide the technology for developing the full potential of U.S. civil and military aeronautics. “Sixth—We should maintain a strong momentum of broad technological advance in all aerospace disciplines.” Although nasa’s 1970 budget was “ ‘holding’ budget,” Dr. Paine said request did include funds for starting three principal new programs: Earth Resources Technology Satellite Program, with start of erts A and b development; nerva flight-weight engine development, postponed from 1969; and series of planetary explorers for future flights to Venus and Mars. In period of “retrenchment and declining resources,” FY 1969 operating budget was $762 million below FY 1968 budget and over $1 billion below FY 1967. Nationwide employment on nasa work had decreased from earlier peak of 420,000 to 270,000 at end of FY 1968, to about 215,000 at end of FY 1969, and under FY 1970 budget to about 190,000. (Testimony)
Merger of U.S. and U.S.S.R. satellite systems into worldwide comsat link for all nations was proposed in report of Sept. 21—25 international conference at Talloires, France, released by sponsors Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Twentieth Century Fund. In Communicating by Satellite: An International Discussion, task force appointed to consider new rules and regulations for international satellite communications said: “Obstacles undoubtedly exist to achieving the goal of an integrated, global system, but technical compatibility between the two major satellite communications systems—Intelsat and Intersputnik (through the Soviet Orbita)—is not difficult to obtain. Their orbital systems are complementary; their frequency plans can be coordinated; a single ground station can operate in either system, and their transmitting and receiving equipment can be adapted for operation in both systems.” All nations should have access to global, integrated comsat system with “willingness and ability to accept certain technical and administrative requirements” only relevant consideration. No political conditions should be applied to membership. Voting rules should “take account of the special contributions” of countries like U.S. and U.S.S.R. “while recognizing the interests of virtually all nations in the basic rules of operation of the system.” No nation should be allowed to broadcast sound and TV into territory of other nations without their consent.

Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, told House Committee on Science and Astronautics in testimony on NASA FY 1970 budget request: “We are moving toward a number of important milestones in the Space Applications Program, the most important of which is the Earth resources survey area, where we are requesting funds for the design and construction of a research satellite, Earth Resources Technology Satellite (erts). We think the ERTS Program will be a very valuable addition to mankind’s tools for handling the natural and cultural resources of the world.” FY 1970 ossa program required $559 million in new obligational authority. Although increased over FY 1969, program was well below FY 1963 through 1967. Increases were in planetary and space applications program, with planetary increases primarily due to costs in FY 1970 of program authorized in FY 1969. In addition, NASA was proposing Planetary Explorer program and dual planet mission to Venus and Mercury for 1973. Space applications increase was for experimental erts satellite and prototype of operational Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (sms). (Testimony)

In its international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched three foreign satellites—Canadian Isis /, third of series to conduct ionospheric measurement; Boreas (Esro IB) for European Space Research Organization on reimbursable basis; and West German Azur under cooperative project to conduct radiation belt measurements. Agreements for new projects were reached with U.K., Italy, Netherlands, and Canada. U.K. agreement called for 1971 launch of satellite on NASA Scout vehicle to measure ionospheric particles and radio noise and experiment to fly on board NASA’s Nimbus-E in 1972. Italian agreement provided for 1970 launch of San Marco-C satellite on NASA Scout vehicle from Italian San Marco range in Indian Ocean and use of range for launching NASA spacecraft into equatorial orbit. Under Netherlands agreement two Dutch scientists would participate as observers in OAO program. Canadian agreement called for reimbursement launching of Canadian comsat. Project Helios, cooperative endeavor with West German Ministry for Scientific Research to place two solar probes (1974—1975) closer to sun than any other spacecraft, would obtain data on solar processes and earth-sun relationship. Under another agreement with West Germany, Project Aeros, NASA would launch German-developed satellite in 1972 for aeronomy measurements. In agreement with Indian space agency, ATS—F satellite would be made available for experimental educational TV broadcasting directly and by relay to receivers in 5,000 Indian villages. Additional cooperative projects during 1969 included launch of one Italian, two U.K., and two French experiments; continuation of sounding rocket projects with Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, and Sweden; inclusion of Canadian and French experiments on Convair 990 flights to study auroras in northern latitudes; and extension of aeronautical research projects with Canada, France, West Germany, and U.K. Agreement with Spain for NASA Madrid tracking station was extended in June until 1984 and negotiations were begun with Australia for extension of tracking arrangements until same year. Lunar surface material returned by Apollo 11 astronauts was distributed to 39 principal investigators from nine countries—Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, West Germany, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, and U.K. International highlights in 1969 included around-the-world tour of Apollo 11 astronauts to dramatize conviction that successful lunar landing was triumph for all mankind; travels of NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, to inform ministerial and space agency officials abroad of U.S. space plans and invite their participation; and participation of foreign experts in NASA conference on space shuttle concepts. Efforts by NASA to develop cooperative programs with U.S.S.R. continued during 1969, but met with limited success. (Pres Rpt 70 [69])
Man has three sets of capabilities that make him extremely hard to replace by any machine,” NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, said in address before nrc Engineering Div.’s annual meeting in Washington, D.C.: “1) he has a very wide-band set of sensors for acquiring information; 2) he has in his head a built-in memory and computer that cannot yet be matched by our largest and fastest machines; and finally he has a remarkably versatile capability for action, and physical operations with his body, hands, and tools. These three capabilities make man such a valuable element in space science and applications that we need to take advantage of him at the site of operations whenever this is feasible. . . . With the prominence that manned flight has gained, it is surprising to ■ realize that while 589 unmanned satellites have been launched, there have been only 29 manned flights, eleven by the USSR and eighteen by the USA. These few experiments have shown that we have the capability to extend man’s genius into the new dimension of space, as far out as the moon. In the years ahead I expect that man will exploit his bridgehead into space and use this new territory for his own good on earth.” (Text)
NASA announced Australis Oscar-A, 39-lb spacecraft designed and constructed by amateur radio operators at Melbourne Univ. in Australia, had been accepted for launch Jan. 9, 1970, as secondary payload on Tiros-M. Radio Amateur Satellite Corp., group of U.S. amateurs, was preparing satellite for launch, testing and qualifying it to comply with NASA requirements. Australis Oscar-A would transmit low-power signals on two amateur bands—29.45 mhz in 10-meter band and 144.05 mhz in 2-meter band—that would be used by radio amateurs throughout world for training in satellite tracking and for radio propagation experiments. Australis Oscar-A would be fifth satellite launched under Project Oscar and first accepted by NASA as secondary payload. Four previous satellites had been launched by group of U.S. radio operators on Pacific Coast in conjunction with dod spacecraft. (NASA Release 69-157)

President Nixon addressed 24th session of U.N. General Assembly: “Of all man’s great enterprises, none lends itself more logically or more compellingly to international cooperation than the venture into space. Here, truly, mankind is one: as fellow creatures from the planet Earth, exploring the heavens that all of us enjoy. The journey of Apollo 11 to the moon and back was not an end, but the beginning. “There will be new journeys of discovery. Beyond this, we are just beginning to comprehend the benefits that space technology can yield here on earth. And the potential is enormous. For example, we are now developing earth resource survey satellites, with the first experimental satellite to be launched sometime early in the decade of the seventies. Present indications are that these satellites should be capable of yielding data which could assist in as widely varied tasks as these: the location of schools of fish in the oceans, the location of mineral deposits on land, the health of agricultural crops. “I feel it is only right that we should share both the adventures and the benefits of space. As an example of our plans, we have determined to take actions with regard to earth resources satellites. . . . The purpose ... is that this program will be dedicated to produce information not only for the United States, but also for the world community. We shall be putting several proposals in this respect before the United Nations, These are among the positive, concrete steps we intend to take toward internationalizing man’s epic venture into space—an adventure that belongs not to one nation but to all mankind.” (PD, 9/22/69, 1275-81)

U.S.S.R. radio and TV gave factual accounts of Apollo 11 launch but maintained third day of silence on Luna XV. Major Soviet news program at 8:30 pm Moscow time showed tape of Apollo 11 liftoff taken from live comsat coverage. In U.K. TV viewers saw launch via transatlantic satellite. BBC scheduled live coverage through July 24 splashdown and would relay broadcasts to continent by cable. London newspapers frontpaged Apollo 11. Daily Express headline read, “Ho Hum—Anyone for the Moon Today?” over report on Telaxed astronauts. Polish TV viewers saw launch via 45-min transmission directly from Cape Kennedy. Hundreds of Germans and Americans crowded Apollo 11 exhibit in Mannheim, Germany, department store. Swedish TV viewers were advised by state broadcasting company not to turn off sets Sunday night—so they could be awakened for scheduled moon landing Monday. Hippies in Iran held milk and honey pots in Teheran restaur ant to toast astronauts. In Egypt, Moslem world’s leading moon expert, Sheikh Ahmand Haredi said, “The Koran urges Moslems to look up from their earthly abode to what lies behind the moon and stars.” Japanese department stores featured models of Apollo command module. In Greece, Aspis-Pronoia insurance company issued first outer-space life insurance policy, to cover Apollo 11 crew at $10,000 each. In Spain people called event most interesting since Columbus discovered America.	• Israel’s state radio broadcast in Hebrew from Cape Kennedy while Israelis stood around TV sets and portable radios in streets.

Radio Nigeria reported launch seven minutes into its morning broadcast. Later it became number one newscast item. Most of Latin America missed launch on TV because of failure of Intelsat-111 F—2 June 29. Latin American newspapers and TV correspondents traveled to U.S. to cover launch and were reported to be outraged by absence of TV coverage in their countries. In Colombia, government asked TV manufacturers to put sets in all town squares. Bogota students would have July 21 off to watch lunar landing. (NYT, 7/17/69, 21, 22; Bishop, C Trib, 7/17/69)
Development of laser tracking techniques permitting accurate 24-hour tracking of orbiting spacecraft was announced by NASA. New technique—particularly important in geodetic studies, which required precise angle and distance measurements between satellite and ground stations—offered greater measuring accuracy than RF methods, required only lightweight reflectors on satellite, and was less affected by transmission-impeding environmental disturbances. First operational daylight tracking with laser had been accomplished by gsfc team Oct. 21, 1968. (nasa Release 69—18; A&A 68)

Canadian Isis I International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies (launched Jan. 30) was adjudged successful by NASA. Nine of ten experiments were operational; ion mass spectrometer had been turned off after one week of operation, when it developed high-voltage problems, and since had been used only for short periods to collect engineering data. Low-frequency receiver experiment had been providing indirect ion data, thus compensating partially for IMS loss. Onboard tape recorder was providing excellent topside ionograms of Antarctic area and other previously inaccessible areas. (NASA Proj Off)
Philadelphia Inquirer cited possible danger to Apollo spacecraft from “drifting junk” in space. “One notable sidelight to the Apollo 10 flight came in a report that the spaceship brings the number of man-made objects in space to 1691. Although the chance of Apollo 10 colliding with any of the objects is infinitesimal, it is significant that there is so much hardware floating around in space 12 years after Sputnik I. . . . “U.S. and Soviet scientists should find ways of bringing back or destroying rockets and satellites and their separate components after they have become inoperable. If some sort of solution isn’t found, it may not be long before a tragic collision will occur.” (P Inq, 5/20/69)
