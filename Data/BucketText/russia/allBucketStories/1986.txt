The Soviet Union launched what it said was a "third generation" Space Station named Mir, the Russian word for peace. The Mir was larger than their Salyut7 Space Station and had six docking ports for habitable modules. With the addition of Salyut laboratories, Russia would have an orbiting complex large enough for permanent crew habitation. (B Sun, Feb 21/86; W Times, Feb 21/86; W Times, Mar 4/86; CSM Mar 7/86)
The Soviet Union invited foreign correspondents into its mission control center for a conference concerning orbiting cosmonauts and a live television interview with them. The Soviet Union set still another precedent when it allowed coverage of its space program by a large group of foreign press. The invitation followed a pattern of a more open Russian space agency, the televising of the recent liftoff of the cosmonauts on March 13, and the opening of the Soviet Space Research Institute to foreign visitors when the Vega spacecraft approached Halley's Comet were also first time events.
