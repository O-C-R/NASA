Dr. Daniel S. Goldin, head of the nation�s space agency, has won support in the White House for his philosophy of smaller, better, and less expensive spacecraft. A case in point is the early planning for a Pluto mission. Four years ago, engineers came up with a concept costing as much as $4 billion. After many redesigns they developed a mission, called Pluto Express, at an estimated cost of $400 million. Instead of packing many instruments into a single craft weighing several tons, engineers designed two lightweight craft weighing as little as 300 pounds each. In the proposed mission, the craft would be launched separately, perhaps by Russian Proton rockets, on �fast� trajectories. They should be able to reach Pluto in 6 to 8 years, compared to Voyager 2�s travel time of 12 years to distant Neptune.
Boris Ostroumov, Deputy General Director of the Russian space agency, said that the Baikonur Cosmodrome is a scientific and technical complex and that it will not become a Russian miliary base. The facilities will be used for scientific and national economic needs and will be administered by the Russian space agency, Ostroumov said. (FBIS-Sov, Jan 10/95)
