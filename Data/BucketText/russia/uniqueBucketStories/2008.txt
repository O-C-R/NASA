NASA announced that it had signed a modification to the ISS contract with the Russian federal space agency Roscosmos for crew transportation services. NASA would use the US$141 million, firm-fixed-price extension to meet the United States’ obligations to its international partners for transportation to and from the ISS. The contract’s extension would cover two Soyuz flights, to carry cargo to and from the ISS and to remove trash. The contract allowed for Roscosmos to launch to the ISS 50 kilograms (110.23 pounds) of cargo per person; to return to Earth 17 kilograms (37.48 pounds) of cargo per person; and to dispose of 30 kilograms (66.14 pounds) of trash per person. Additionally, the contract extension covered broad support for a long-duration mission for three ISS crew members, including crew rescue and training and preparation for launch and landing. The crew members would launch aboard two Soyuz rockets in the fall of 2011 and would land on Earth in the spring of 2012.(NASA, “NASA Extends Contract with Russian Federal Space Agency,” news release C08-068, 2 December 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/dec/HQ_08-317_Dale_resigns.html (accessed 22 August 2011).)
