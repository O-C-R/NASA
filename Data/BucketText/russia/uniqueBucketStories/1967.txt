U.N. space law treaty had been ratified by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Tass announced. Presidium acted on behalf of the Supreme Soviet when the full body was not in session. Ratified by U.S. Senate April 25, treaty would become effective when U.S., U.S.S.R., U.K., and two other nations had filed ratification papers. Washington Evening Star later commented: “. . . [the space law treaty] may not be one of the most significant agreements of our time, but it is surely the most far-reaching, encompassing nothing less than the infinities between us and the stars. It is an agreement, moreover, that puts America and Russia on the same side. It can be helpful as an example of what the two of us can do together—down here on the troubled earth—to promote a good and enduring peace.” (NYT, 5/20/ 67, 1, 5; AP, W Star, 5/20/67, A5; W Post, 5/20/67, 1; W Star, 5/22/67, A16)
Washington Evening Star editorial praised Senate’s unanimous approval of the space law treaty April 25: “The action lends timely support to President Johnson’s policy of seeking to promote a spirit of detente through various types of agreements designed to build Bridges between our country and the Communist East. “. . . the new space treaty is at best only a modest step in the direction of improved Soviet-American relations. Still, it is a step forward, and a good one. Anybody who objects to it on security grounds can rest assured: It will not interfere in the slightest with our country’s ability to detect Russian cheating between us and the stars if such cheating actually takes place.” (W Star, 5/1/67)
