LaRC announced that Sir Robert Mark, former director of New Scotland Yard (his official title was Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis), would be guest speaker at a center colloquium on terrorism and law enforcement as part of the public lecture series, “Our Future in the Cosmos.” The lecture would contrast philosophy and methodology of British and U.S. criminal justice systems, including the areas of capital punishment, terrorism, and political influence on police matters, reflecting the speaker’s feeling that a free society is governed by consent rather than by force. (LaRC Release 77-45) Officials had canceled Soyuz 25 only 26hr into the mission because of unspecified trouble, although the craft had come within 130yd of the Salyut 6. The Moscow domestic service in Russian said only that the linkup was called off “due to deviations from the planned procedure for docking.” The word that the flight was canceled came after 24hr of silence, which had caused fears for the safety of the crew. Tass said Oct. 12 that the capsule had returned safely, landing in Kazakhstan at 6:25am local time Oct. 11. U.S. officials speculated that, like Soyuz 15 in Aug. 1974 and Soyuz 23 in Oct. 1976, this mission failed because the cosmonauts had overshot the docking point and could not make another attempt because their battery power allowed insufficient time to correct the navigational error. When a crew last overshot its Salyut, 4mo elapsed before another crew made a docking attempt.
