President Nixon announced James H. Wakelin, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of the Navy for R&D, would be chairman of new Presidential Task Force on Oceanography [see Sept. 22]. (PD, 10/13/69, 1393-4) Soyuz VII, carrying Cosmonauts Anatoly V. Filipchenko, Vladislav N. Volkov, and Viktor V. Gorbatko, was launched from Baikonur at 3:45 pm Oct. 12 into orbit with 217-km (134.8-mi) apogee, 200-km (124.3-mi) perigee, 88.4-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass said spacecraft’s mission was “maneuvering in the orbit, staging joint navigation observations of the spaceships ... in group flight, observation of celestial bodies and the horizon of the Earth, determination of the real luminosity of stars, observation of changes in illumination created by the Sun and other scientific experiments.” Third spacecraft, Soyuz VIII, carrying Cosmonauts Vladimir A. Shatalov and Dr. Aleksey S. Yeliseyev, was launched from Baikonur at 3:29 pm Oct. 13 into orbit with 278-km (172.7-mi) apogee, 215-km (133.6-mi) perigee, 89.4-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Its mission, Tass said, was “comprehensive simultaneous scientific studies in near-terrestrial space in accordance with an extensive program; testing of the complex system of controlling a simultaneous group flight of three space ships; mutual maneuvering of ships in orbit with the aim of solving a number of problems of developing the piloted space system.” TV viewers received announcement of flights about 30 min after launches and saw video-tape recordings of launches about U/2 hrs later. Ultimate goal of three-spacecraft mission was not given. In prelaunch interview shown on TV several hours after launch, Dr. Yeliseyev said group mission would conduct experiments leading to “creation of still more powerful orbiting stations.” Tass reported crews had checked out equipment and communicated with each other. Soyuz VI	was conducting medical-biological tests, Soyuz VII was observing and photographing earth and celestial bodies, and Soyuz VIII was conducting research on polarization of solar light reflected by atmosphere. On Oct. 14 Tass reported Soyuz VII and Soyuz VIII had moved close together, carried out “mutual observation-photography and movie filming,” studied “possibility of exchanging information with the aid of light signals and visceral optical methods,” conducted series of medical experiments, and observed “effect of erosion by micrometeorites on the condition of illuminators and optic systems of the craft.” On Oct. 15 spacecraft approached to within 500 yds during rendezvous, while Soyuz VI hovered nearby. On Oct. 16 Radio Moscow announced Soyuz VI had successfully completed mission and had softlanded in preset area 100 mi northwest of Karaganda at 12:52 pm Moscow time. No information on other two Soyuz spacecraft was given until Tass announced softlanding of Soyuz VII	at 12:36 pm Oct. 17 and of Soyuz VIII at 12:10 pm Oct. 18. Western officials speculated missions had not achieved all objectives. Tass said all major tasks were carried out with “high efficiency.” (Gwertzman, NYT, 10/12-14, 18/69; SBD, 10/14/69, 195; 10/ 21/69, 230; Reuters, W Post, 10/15-16/69; AP, W Star, 10/16/69, Al; Reston, LA Times, 10/19/69, A2; gsfc SSR, 10/15/69; 10/31/69)
In editorial directed to “Americans who think Soviet Russia is ‘mellowing’ ” and who opposed President Nixon’s Safeguard abm plan, New York News noted U.S.S.R. had paraded no military gear in Moscow May Day parade and limited oratory “to a peace-it’s-wonderful speech” by Brezhnev. Paper then quoted April 30 issue of Partinaya Zhizn in which Marshal Matvey V. Zakharov, U.S.S.R. Chief of Staff, described Soviet stockpile of nuclear missiles: “ ‘These rockets are always prepared for immediate firing. Global rockets have unlimited range, and are able not only to carry colossal payloads but to overcome the antimissile defense of the adversary.’” (NY News, 5/2/69)
