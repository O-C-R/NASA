Soyuz TMA-17, carrying Timothy J. Creamer, Soichi Noguchi, and Oleg V. Kotov, docked with the ISS at 22:48 (GMT). An automated docking system successfully brought the craft into port on the Earth-facing side of the Russian Zarya module. Hatches opened at 00:30 (GMT). The new arrivals floated onto the station wearing red Santa hats and elf hats and carrying a small Christmas tree and a white sack of gifts. Jeffrey N. Williams and Maxim V. Suraev welcomed them on board the ISS, where they would live for six months as members of the Expedition 22 and Expedition 23 missions.(James Dean, “New Crew Set To Begin Six-Month Stay on Station,” Florida Today (Brevard, FL), 23 December 2009; Clara Moskowitz, “New Crew Arrives at Space Station,” Space.com, 23 December 2009, http://www.space. com/7704-crew-arrives-space-station.html (accessed 9 January 2012).)
