First volume of third edition of Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsklopediya, new Soviet encyclopedia, was released in U.S.S.R. It credited Wright Brothers with first airplane flight. Second edition, which appeared from 1950 to 1958, had contended that Russian, A. F. Mozhaisky, was designer of first airplane, which had been flown first during summer of 1882. This version had appeared in U.S.S.R. as late as 1968, in history of Russian aviation and astronautics published by Ministry of Defense. New edition of encyclopedia said Mozhaisky’s airplane was built in 1885 and “crashed on take-off.” (Gwertzman, NYT, 3/24/70, 6)
