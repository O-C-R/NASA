First official Soviet comment on President Kennedy’s proposal for U.S.-U.S.S.R. lunar cooperation came from Russian news agency Tass. While not identifying the proposal with the President, Tass said: “Maybe it is too early to discuss now the question what is better—to combine a Soviet rocket with an American spaceship or to include an American in the Soviet space crew, but first steps in cooperation cannot but give satisfaction.” A few hours later, Cosmonaut Pavel Popovich made an unscheduled talk on Moscow Radio, calling for a “common effort by the peoples of all states of our planet” to solve the earthly difficulties that hinder man’s flight to the stars.

Two Soviet Ilyushin-18 transport aircraft completed 15,000-mile flight from Moscow to the Russian Antarctic base of Mirny. Director of the Leningrad Polar Institute, A. Treshnokov, said in New Zealand that such flights might well inaugurate regular supply flights between Moscow and the Antarctic. (Reuters, Wash. Post, 12/1/63, A29)
Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, interviewed on nbc-tv, said he was surprised in May 1960 when the U.S.S.R. publicized the downing of the U.S. U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Russia. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles also “believed just as I did that it was necessary to use it but he also believed that it would cause no real publicity if one of them should fall.” Both of them felt that the Soviets would not be willing to concede publicly that for “three or four years we’ve been doi'ig this . . . .” On the question of admitting U.S. responsibility ror the flights, Mr. Eisenhower said: “ . . . I just thought as L.ig as the thing had come out, the best thing to do—and I don’t believe I asked anyone’s advice on this—I just said ‘l am responsible and that’s that.’” (TFasA Post, 11/4/631
On test ban treaty, U.S. News and World Report said: “Nuclear test ban does not mean disarmament. Nuclear weapons still will be the weapons of future war. Weapon testing will not come to a full stop. “Tests will continue underground. France will go on testing in the air. Red China will test in the air, too, if and when she gets the bomb .... “Test agreement, now being entered into, favors Russia. Russia, behind in smaller nuclear weapons, can catch up by testing underground. United States, behind in bigger weapons and in an antimissile missile, will be hindered in her effort to catch up by the bar against testing in the atmosphere .... “Just as long as Russia is a closed country, ruled by a dictatorship, possessed of weapons capable of destroying United States, there can be no real disarmament, no real end to the arms race without great danger . . . .”	(U.S. News, 8/5/63, in OR,
The April issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, included an article by Dr. Robert E. Marshak, entitled “Reexamining the Soviet Scientific Challenge.” In this article, Dr. Marshak, chairman of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Rochester, pointed out that Soviet preeminence in space does not necessarily mean that the U.S.S.R. has “achieved a decisive scientific and technological supremacy.” Comparing the “closed” economic and political structure of Soviet Russia with its controlled educational system to the “open” society of the United States, he suggested that the Soviet system was geared to the more tangible results of applied science while the United States had made greater strides in pure science. “Soviet space triumphs are due to an early and precise delineation of a major national goal in applied science and a most detailed and deliberate organization of the wherewithal to achieve it. “. . . I believe that our [the United States’] undoubted leadership in pure science will continue to be nurtured by the openness, freedom, and free enterprise spirit which characterize our society. Our accomplishments in pure science will provide a vast reservoir of ideas for important achievements in applied science, and our innate good sense and good will lead to a voluntary rational measure of coordination and control in those areas which are indispensable for the achievement of our national objectives in applied science. I believe that the Soviet methods of strict supervision and control will lead to numerous short-range breakthroughs in applied science but that the momentum will not be sustained unless there are also significant advances in their pure science. A great improvement in the quality of these achievements will depend upon their ability to fully establish the conditions of scientific freedom which are essential for highly creative work in pure science. “. . . If the Soviet Government comes to realize—and I believe that the Russian scientists already do—that scientific and political freedom go hand in hand and that it is difficult to guarantee scientific freedom without a major liberalization of Soviet society in all its aspects, there is bound to be a great efflorescence of pure science in the Soviet Union. And if a large measure of political freedom is established in the Soviet Union, it is quite likely that we shall be sending our American astronauts together with their Russian counterparts on joint expeditions to the moon and other celestial objects beyond.” {CR, 5/27/63, 9036-38) During April: Air Force launched an Atlas F with a Chrysler-built nose cone on a 5,000-mile flight from Cape Canaveral to the vicinity of Ascension Island in a continuation of the Advanced Ballistic Re-entry System (Abres) test program. The flight, which largely duplicated the initial Abres test of Mar. 1, was described as “highly successful.” (M&R, 5/6/63, 11)
A roundup of world press opinion on the manned lunar landing race, following Premier Khrushchev’s statement of Oct. 26 that Russia was not presently planning manned lunar flight, indicated that the majority of the newspapers thought Khrushchev had made a sensible decision which the U.S. ought to follow.

Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, president of Cal Tech, said in speech before Spring Recognition Dinner of Miracle Mile Association, Los Angeles: “The United States had put 118 space vehicles into orbit, whereas Russia has only placed 34. We are ahead of Russia on scientific data because of these space probes. “Proof of this is in the papers published by the Soviet Union. There has been very little scientific knowledge gleaned from their reports in the past few years, whereas the United States has given a wealth of information on space problems. “Through these probes we have been able to evaluate the temperature on the planet Venus. Of more important issue to us on Earth is the invaluable aid in predicting our own weather. . . .” (L.A. Herald-Examiner, 3/13/63)
The Russian Deople heard of President Kennedy’s U.N. proposal for joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. lunar exploration for first time. Pravda reprinted without comment Walter Lippmann’s column praising the President’s proposal. (AP, Wash. Post, 10/2/63)
Dr. T. L. K. Smull, nasa Director of Grants and Research Contracts, said in commencement address, Univ. of Georgia: “Today we are dealing not only with profound changes in a social and economic structure of our country and of the world; we are dealing as well with even more profound changes in man’s own conception of the boundaries and limitations of his habitable environment and of his understanding of the forces of the universe. “Therefore, the opportunities available to you graduates in the next decade are, in a very real sense, boundless. The challenges of tomorrow are not just for the scientist, the engineer, and the technician working toward scientific developments, but for all men and women in all professions—for every one of you. Even if science is not your field, you must understand what it implies simply because science will continue affecting your lives with even greater impact as each year passes .... “Never before has a civilization seized upon and exploited a new technology at the rate man is now exploring the new dimension of space. In the 2,060 days since the Russians launched Sputnik, nasa has conducted 96 major vehicle launchings, an average of one every 22 days. In this period, the ussr has announced about 35 successful space flights. 741-623 0—64--21 “nasa’s impressive accomplishments will be dwarfed by United States activities during the rest of this decade as our understanding of the nature of space, the sun, and the map of the Universe is greatly enhanced. “In an age of exploding knowledge in all of the physical sciences no area of human activity better focuses and dramatizes the meaning of today than does this boldest, most challenging arena of space . . . .” (Text)
