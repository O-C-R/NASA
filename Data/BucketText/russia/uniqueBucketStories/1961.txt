This is why it is risky to open even the smallest loopholes in the world of Soviet rocket technique for the gentlemen who are lagging considerably behind as far as their technique is concerned, but who become militarily agitated and distracted from an honest program of general and complete disarmament and who mumble something about the right of inspection of neighbors’ orchards and storerooms. That is why the wonderful group of heroes who insured the mastering of the cosmos remain nameless until now.”
