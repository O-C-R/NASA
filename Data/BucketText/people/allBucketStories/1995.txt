A Russian space enthusiast, Sergei Leskov, lamented the declining state of the Russian space program in the January 19 issue of "Izvestia." Production of rockets and other hardware has declined in the last few years, Leskov said, and even the hardware in orbit was on its last legs. The Mir space station, too, had grown old and increasingly gave mission controllers nasty surprises. He noted that during the past five years, funding of the space sector had been cut five-to-ten-fold in certain areas. The contract with the United States for construction of the Alpha space station had been the salvation of the Russian space sector, but only a small range of enterprises were involved in it, and the project did not promote development of new technologies. Without an infusion of more money, Leskov wrote, the Russian space sector could find itself as much a part of history as the Pyramid of Cheops. (BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, Jan 23/95).
NASA reported that three years of data collection from its Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) confirmed that Clorofluorocarbons (CFCs) cause ozone loss.  The satellite detected CFCs and hydrogen fluoride, a product of the chemical breakdown of CFCs, in the stratosphere. (AvWk, Jan 2/95; The Grand Rapids Press, Jan 2/95)A General Accounting Office report called NASA's plans to expand and fund the scientific research needed to support a manned space facility unrealistic. The report indicated that NASA's projected $18 billion cost for Space Station Freedom was far too low. The chief congressional critic of the space station, Sen. William Cohen, estimated a $71 billion price tag. (AvWk, Jan 2/95; The Grand Rapids Press, Jan 2/95)
Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope to study quasars began to reassess their theories after studying a series of quasars during the past few months. The astronomers expected the quasars, thought to be super-massive "black holes," to be surrounded by galaxies that "feed" the quasar. Instead, none of the first eight quasars they studied was surrounded by a galaxy, raising questions about of how black holes form and sustain themselves. "I really don't understand this," said project astronomer John Bahcall in a report to the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona. (LA Times, Jan 13/95; W Post, Jan 13/95)
President Bill Clinton presented astronaut Jim Lovell with the Space Medal of Honor, 25 years after he brought his crippled Apollo 13 spacecraft home. Actor Tom Hanks, who played Jim Lovell in the film �Apollo 13,� was present at the ceremony. The president said that the �extraordinary mission� was made even more vivid by the recent �Apollo 13� film. (W Post, July 27/95; W Times, Jul 27/95; USA Today, Jul 27/95; AP, Jul 26/95 & Jul 27/95; Reuters, Jul 26/95; UPI, Jul 26/95)
A senior scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, Kenneth M. Towe, refuted a recent satellite-based NASA claim that the presence of hydrogen fluoride in the atmosphere confirms that ozone depletion is largely caused by clorofluorocarbons. Towe pointed out that, contrary to NASA's contention, hydrogen fluoride does have a natural source--it is emitted by volcanoes--and it plays a large role in the destruction of ozone in the lower stratosphere. Towe's position received corroboration from another authority, Michael S. Coffman, president of Environmental Perspectives, Inc., in Bangor, Maine.
