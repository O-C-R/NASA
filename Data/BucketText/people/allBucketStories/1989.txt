Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collins participated in the first of several planned ceremonies at NASA facilities commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the first crewassisted lunar landing on July 20, 1969. Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins gathered at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, with a crowd of 6,000 NASA employees and their families to commemorate the launching of their Saturn V rocket from KSC on July 16, 1969. The ceremony included a playback of the final three minutes of the Apollo 11 countdown and statements by the former astronauts. Following the ceremony, the astronauts rode in a 20mile motorcade to Cocoa Beach, where they `"attended a luncheon in their honor. (UPI, Jul 16/89; USA Today, Jul (#17/89; B Sun, Jul 17/89)
The Space Shuttle Discovery was successfully launched at night from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on mission STS33. Discovery carried a classified Department of Defense payload believed to be a $300 million surveillance satellite. The satellite was deployed from the Shuttle's cargo bay on November 23, and was scheduled to boost itself into a geostationary orbit. Several experiments of Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) technology were also expected to be performed. Crew members for STS33 were Air Force Colonel Frederick Gregory (Commander), Air Force Colonel John Blaha (Pilot), and Mission Specialists Navy Captain Manley L. Carter Jr., F. Story Musgrave, and Kathryn C. Thornton. Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on November 27.

The Soviet Union successfully launched a COSMOS 2021 satellite. (AP, May 28/89; UPI, May 28/89) During May: Astronomers at Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, published results of a study which confirmed that Pluto is a planet and not an asteroid or a wayward natural satellite. William McKinnon, Associate Professor of Planetary Science at Washington University, asserted that his analysis of telescopic data and computer models showed that Pluto was formed independently in the outer solar system as a planet.

The Space Shuttle Atlantis was successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on mission STS34 to0*deploy the $1.4 billion Galileo Jupiter space probe. The Atlantis launch had been delayed by a week because of problems with a computer, a main engine master control device, and, finally, rain. Shortly after reaching orbit, Atlantis released the Galileo probe and the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) from the cargo bay. The IUS subsequently fired Galileo on a trajectory toward Venus, in preparation for a gravity assist maneuver that would swing the spacecraft back toward Earth twice and onward to Jupiter. Galileo was scheduled to reach Jupiter in December 1995, whereupon it would begin orbiting the planet for 22 months of observations of the Jovian system. Approximately five months before reaching Jupiter, Galileo would release a 34inch unpowered descent module that would enter the Jovian upper atmosphere and descend several hundred miles before being destroyed by extreme atmospheric pressure. The AtlantisGalileo mission had sparked protests and a law suit by antinuclear groups concerned over the danger of possible radioactive contamination from the probe's radioisotope thermal generators in the event of a catastrophic accident. In anticipation of possible efforts to disrupt the launch, NASA increased security measures at KSC. In addition to launching Galileo, the STS34 crew would conduct observations of the Earth's ozone layer and perform several onboard medical, biological, and materials processing experiments. The crew included Navy Captain Donald E. Williams (Commander), Navy Commander Michael J. McCulley (Pilot), and Mission Specialists Shannon Lucid, Franklin Changaz, and Ellen S. Baker. The mission ended successfully on October 23 with Atlantis landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

This date marked the twentieth anniversary of the first crewassisted landing on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin. Armstrong, Aldrin, and their crewmate, Michael Collins, commemorated the lunar landing with ceremonies at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC, and the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. During the Washington ceremony, attended by President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, the President proposed a long range program of humanassisted space exploration, including a permanently habitable base on the Moon and a crew expedition to Mars, but did not establish a specific timetable. The President cited Space Station Freedom as an important stepping stone toward missions to the Moon and Mars. Speaking at the National Air and Space Museum, Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to step on the lunar surface, said: "The Apollo program enjoyed a certain nobility of purposea program not to conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance. A program not to exploit, but to explore. A program not to take from others, but to give to all, to give new knowledge, to enlarge the human horizon."

The director of NASA's Ames Research Center (ARC), William F. Ballhaus Jr., resigned, citing "inadequate compensation for senior Federal executives and vague new postgovernment employment regulations" as reasons for his departure. Ballhaus had been a NASA engineer and manager for 18 years and was serving his second term as ARC director. (NASA Release 89111, Jul 7/89; AP, Jul 7/89)
Acting NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly announced the appointment of former Space Shuttle astronaut William B. Lenoir as Associate Administrator for Space Station. Lenoir replaced James B. Odom, who was retiring. Truly also announced the appointment of Richard Kohrs as Director, Space Station Freedom.

NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly named Dale L. Compton to be Director of the NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California, effective December 20. Compton, who succeeded William F. Ballhaus, had been Acting Director since Ballhaus resigned on July 15. (NASA Release 89182, Dec 11/89)
President George Bush reestablished the National Space Council, an executive space policy advisory group to be chaired by the Vice President. The Space Council was originally created by President John F. Kennedy and disbanded in 1973 by President Richard Nixon. President Bush restored the Space Council as an official forum for setting longrange policy for United States civil, military, and commercial space efforts. (WH Release, Apr 20/89; UPI, May 12/89)
