Writing in the New York Times, author John Lukacs called the proposed $8.4 billion Super Collider in Texas "super nonsense." He labelled as outdated the view held by proponents of the Super Collider that science might discover the smallest building block of the universe and that the universe could be explained by a Grand Unified Theory. (NY Times, June 17/93)
Dr. John Peoples Jr., director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, was appointed to take over direction of the dismantling of the Superconducting Super Collider in Texas.

Edward Frieman, who served as chairman of the White-House-led Earth Observing System Engineering Review Committee, said that NASA needed to institute an outside review process for its science missions. NASA's internal review process tended to bloat rather than streamline science missions, he said. "They're really not review teams, they're the advocates, said Frieman, director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in LaJolla, California. (Space News, Mar 1-7/93)

Writing in the Washington Post, Michael Schrage, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, suggested that a dramatic and effective way to boost the nation's industrial competitiveness while sending a signal that the Cold War was over would be to cut in half the budget of the national laboratories. The move might shock the labs into more energetically redefining their mission, according to Schrage. The national labs include the University of California's Lawrence Livermore Lab, Los Alamos in New Mexico, and Brookhaven in New York. (W Post, Feb 19/93)
The Pentagon announced that Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition John Deutch had agreed to hold $10 million in Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funding pending the outcome of a Department of Defense (DoD) launch modernization study and a 60-day NASA-DoD review of the Delta Clipper-Experimental (DC-X) flight test program.

Scientist John Bradley of MVA Inc. in Norcross, Georgia, said in a report in the journal Science that ancient space dust particles, composed of a black glassy substance embedded with metal, that zipped into Earth's atmosphere might be older than the solar system. Some of these tiny dust grains appeared to be similar to one of the major raw materials of the universe, interstellar dust grains, known as GEMS (glass with embedded metal and sulfides). Scientists collected GEMS, which they believed were left from a passing comet's wake, from a NASA U-2 airplane several miles above Earth. The GEMS were rare--only one or two were collected per hour of U-2 flight time--but showed signs of exposure to irradiation when studied under a transmission electron miscroscope. (UP, Aug 11/94)
A senior scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, Kenneth M. Towe, refuted a recent satellite-based NASA claim that the presence of hydrogen fluoride in the atmosphere confirms that ozone depletion is largely caused by clorofluorocarbons. Towe pointed out that, contrary to NASA's contention, hydrogen fluoride does have a natural source--it is emitted by volcanoes--and it plays a large role in the destruction of ozone in the lower stratosphere. Towe's position received corroboration from another authority, Michael S. Coffman, president of Environmental Perspectives, Inc., in Bangor, Maine. (W Times, Jan 10/95; WSJ, Jan 12/95; Bangor Daily News, Jan 11/95))
Rockwell International Corporation pled guilty to charges of violating federal law in disposing of hazardous waste. Federal prosecutors had charged the company with violating the law after a 1994 explosion at a Rockwell rocket-testing facility in Southern California killed scientists Otto K. Heiney and Larry A. Pugh. Rockwell’s Chief Executive Officer Donald R. Beall called the incident “a corporate failure for which we accept responsibility.” By pleading guilty, Rockwell acknowledged liability and agreed to pay a US$6.5 million fine. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the case was only one aspect of a long-term investigation into Rockwell’s compliance with environmental regulations, an investigation that Rockwell’s guilty plea did not end. Federal auditors were also looking into the possibility that Rockwell had overcharged NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense for disposal costs.(Andy Pasztor, “Rockwell Probe To Continue After Unit Pleads Guilty to Waste-Disposal Charge,” Wall Street Journal, 9 April 1996; Mark Reed, “Firm Agrees To Pay Fine in Fatal Blast,” Los Angeles Times, 9 April 1996. 54 New York Times, “NASA Research Plane Aids in Waste Cleanup,” 9 April 1996.)
While constructing a piping trench, two surveyors at NASA’s LARC located the fossil remains of a 3.5 million-year-old, 30-foot (9-meter) baleen whale. The workers found the whale’s skull, tympanic bulla, vertebrae, and rib fragments. Langley loaned the remains to the nearby College of William and Mary. Gerald H. Johnson, a geologist at the College of William and Mary, suggested that the discovery provided a clue to the history of the Langley site, indicating that the Atlantic shoreline probably used to be located 30−40 miles (48−64 kilometers) west of its present location.(NASA, “Ancient Whale Surfaces at NASA Langley,” news release 96-145, 22 July 1996.)
European astronomers unveiled a new, more accurate map of the stars. Scientists immediately praised the 17-volume celestial guide as a milestone in astronomy. The ESA’s Hipparcos project had produced the map over 17 years, at a cost approaching US$1 billion. Astronomers called the release of the Hipparcos data the beginning of a new and fruitful debate. Hipparcos Project Scientist Michael Perryman said, “It’s a massive leap forward in our understanding. But the science of Hipparcos doesn’t stop here. For the scientific community it is just beginning.” In total, the map indicated the positions and motions of more than 118,000 stars.(Association Press, “Mapping the Heavens,” 15 May 1997.)
Two competing teams using NASA’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) discovered the first known accretion-powered millisecond pulsar. The scientists believed the pulsar to be the missing link between two known types of stars: 1) “old, accreting neutron stars, which are powerful sources of [x]-rays generated from the material they are gobbling up from their companions,” and 2) even older “radiowave emitting pulsars that are rotating very rapidly and slowing down gradually.” Because the new star, designated SAX J1808.4-3658, was both emitting x-rays and spinning rapidly, scientists believed it was the link between the accreting and the radiowaveemitting neutron stars. Michiel van der Klis and Rudy Wijnands of the University of Amsterdam found the new pulsar—called the “Holy Grail of X-ray astronomy”—and measured the time between its rapid x-ray pulses, to derive its rotation rate. Van der Klis explained that, based on the fact of accretion, astrophysicists had long theorized that millisecond pulsars existed, but this was the first time that one had been “caught in the act.” Accretion, the process of drawing gas from a nearby “companion” star, causes pulsars to heat up, emitting x-rays. After accretion ends, high-velocity beams of subatomic particles continue to “blow material off the companion,” eventually causing the companion to vanish. Deepto Chakrabarty and Edward H. Morgan of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led the team that found the pulsar’s 2-hour orbital period, measured the orbit, and inferred the presence of the companion star. Tod E. Strohmayer, a member of the RXTE team at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, suggested, “[x]-ray and particle beam ablation may explain why millisecond pulsars are often found alone, despite the fact that they required a companion star to speed up.” Pulsars “vaporize” their companions, thus hiding the evidence, which is, as Strohmayer described it, the “stellar version of the perfect crime.”(NASA, “Newly Discovered Stellar Cannibal Provides Missing Link,” news release 98-129, 22 July 1998; Rudy Wijnands and Michiel van der Klis, “A Millisecond Pulsar in an X-ray Binary System,” Nature 394, no. 6691 (23 July 1998): 344–346; Deepto Chakrabarty and Edward H. Morgan, “The Two-Hour Orbit of a Binary Millisecond X-ray Pulsar,” Nature 394, no. 6691 (23 July 1998): 346–348.)
In the second-longest spacewalk in NASA’s history, lasting 8 hours and 15 minutes, Steven L. Smith and John M. Grunsfeld successfully replaced all six of HST’s gyroscopes and had “just enough time to equip each of the telescope’s six batteries with a voltage regulator to prevent overheating.” NASA believed corroded wires had caused the gyroscope failures. To avoid repeating the failure, engineers used pressurized nitrogen rather than air to force fluid into the new gyroscopes. Smith and Grunsfeld alternated working inside the tight space housing the gyroscopes. Because of his long arms, NASA assigned the 6-foot-3.5-inch-tall (1.9-meter-tall) Smith, who had worked on HST during its last service call in 1997, the task of replacing the two sets of gyroscopes on the sides, which were more difficult to reach. The spacewalk lasted 2 hours longer than scheduled. Although Smith and Grunsfeld went to work an hour early and quickly organizing their tools in the cargo bay, the pair needed extra time to open coolant-line valves on a disabled infrared camera and encountered difficulty latching the doors of the cargo bay holding the equipment.(Marcia Dunn for the Associated Press, “Hubble Gets a Transplant: Initial Check Says New Parts Are Working,” Los Angeles Times, 23 December 1999, Associated Press, “Crew Replaces All 6 Hubble Gyroscopes,” Washington Times, 23 December 1999.)
During a spacewalk lasting nearly 6 hours, cosmonauts Viktor M. Afanasyev and Sergei V. Avdeyev searched for the source of a leak that was slowly causing pressure loss in Mir; they also attempted to install an antenna needed for an experiment. Both efforts failed. The leak, first detected in late June 1999, was “above the allowable limit.” Although it posed no immediate threat to the space station, if the leak continued for three more months, the station would become uninhabitable.(Nikolai Pavlov for Reuters, “Mir Crew Spacewalks To Seek Pressure Leak,” 23 July 1999; Kansas City Star (MO), “Antenna Failure Prevents Mir Test: Two Cosmonauts Give Up After Trying To Fix It for Six Hours,” 24 July 1999.)
Cosmonauts Viktor M. Afanasyev and Sergei V. Avdeyev departed Mir with their French colleague Jean-Pierre Haigneré, leaving the station empty for the first time in 131⁄2 years. On 2 August, in preparation for the departure, the crew had installed a new computer, which provided orientation and docking management systems to keep the station in orbit during the absence of a crew. The crew had also installed a ground-controlled backup system, which would prevent the station from crashing to Earth if a malfunction occurred on board the station.(David Hoffman, “Cosmonauts Abandon Mir: Russian Space Station Faces Demise After 13 Years Aloft,” Washington Post, 28 August 1999; Andrei Shukshin for Reuters, “Russia’s Mir Has New Computer in Control,” 2 August 1999; Reuters, “Russia’s Mir Crew Fit Equipment To Leave Station,” 6 August 1999.)
NASA announced the inauguration of a program focused on designing a probe that could collide with a comet traveling at speeds of more than 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) per hour. Researchers had created the Deep Impact Mission program in the belief that the collision might enable measurement of the materials comprising the comet. The plan called for a 770-pound (349-kilogram) impactor, featuring cameras and an infrared spectrometer, to collect data from the comet. NASA selected Michael A’Hearn of the University of Maryland as Project Leader, with NASA’s JPL and Ball Aerospace Technology Corporation as the designers of the probe. The effort targeted Comet Tempel 1, discovered in 1867, which orbits Earth every five and one- half years. Following in the wake of several comet-related discoveries, the Deep Impact Mission focused on analyzing the composition of comets and determining how they might have affected the rest of the universe. NASA had designated a budget of US$279 million for the project.(NASA, “NASA Gives Green Light for Deep Impact Mission Development,” news release 01-99, 24 May 2001. 67 SpaceRef.com, “Galileo Millennium Mission Status,” 24 May 2001, http://www.spaceref.com/news/ viewsr.html?pid=2913 (accessed 30 July 2001); NASA, “Galileo Gets One Last Close Encounter with Jupiter’s Callisto,” news release 01-97, 22 May 2001.)
Michael A. Chowdry, the founder and chairperson of Atlas Air Inc., and Jeff Cole, the aerospace editor for the Wall Street Journal, died in a plane crash, which occurred minutes after takeoff from the Front Range Airport in Watkins, Colorado. Chowdry had formed Atlas Air in 1992, to lease jumbo cargo jets and to provide flight crews to the airfreight industry. Since 1999, readers of the Wall Street Journal had known Cole for his detailed and insightful coverage of the defense and aerospace industries. After interviewing Chowdry, Cole had accepted his invitation to ride aboard a Czech fighter jet. Chowdry was piloting the jet when it crashed.(Wall Street Journal, “Crash Kills Atlas Air Chairman and Journal’s Aerospace Editor,” 25 January 2001.)
NASA appointed John H. Campbell as Senior Manager at WFF and Director of GSFC Suborbital and Special Orbital Projects Directorate. In 1987 Campbell had begun his NASA career as a Systems Engineering Manager for the Flight Systems Software Branch, at GSFC in Greenbelt, Maryland. In the years before his appointment at WFF, NASA had awarded Campbell its Distinguished Service Medal, Outstanding Leadership Medal, and Exceptional Achievement Medal.(Inside Wallops, “Wallops Senior Manager Appointed,” 14 January 2002, http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ wallops/news/newsletters_archive.html#y2002 (accessed 29 July 2002).)
William W. Parsons Jr. replaced Roy S. Estess as Director of SSC. Parsons had joined NASA in 1990 as a Launch Site Support Manager at NASA’s KSC, later serving in various positions at NASA’s KSC, SSC, and JSC.

NASA scientist Robert Michael Hornstein died of a brain tumor at the age of 57. Hornstein had worked for NASA since 1968, directing its worldwide network of antennas used for communicating with orbiting spacecraft. Hornstein, who had joined NASA during the Apollo program to design programs for ground tracking systems, was “recognized for helping save the Apollo 9 mission from being aborted shortly after launch when he modified tracking software to compensate for a computer malfunction in the launch vehicle.” As Ground Networks Director, Hornstein had helped administer network-tracking facilities during Space Shuttle orbits, the Voyager program, the Galileo recovery effort and mission to Jupiter, the Magellan program, and the international Halley’s Comet tracking program. He had helped manage the upgrade of Deep Space Network facilities in Australia, California, and Spain and had acted as NASA’s primary representative in arranging cooperative tracking efforts with other countries. NASA had awarded Hornstein its Outstanding Leadership Award and Exceptional Service Medal, and the Soviet Union had honored him with membership in its Federation of Cosmonautics.(Washington Post, “Robert Hornstein; NASA Scientist Ran Tracking System,” 28 March 2003.)
X Prize contestant SpaceShipOne successfully carried out its first glide flight after the White Knight carrier craft towed it to an altitude of 47,000 feet (14,326 meters) and released it. Pilot Michael W. Melvill guided the craft to a desert landing. Scaled Composites, which had built SpaceShipOne, issued a report of the test indicating that the two vehicles had separated cleanly, that handling qualities of the craft had correlated closely with ground-based simulations, and that on-board avionics and cockpit displays had performed flawlessly.(Leonard David, “X Prize Contestant Scaled Composites’ SpaceShipOne Flies,” Space News, 9 August 2003.)
NASA-funded researchers announced that they had found the most distant object orbiting the Sun yet discovered. Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology had led a team of scientists to discover a small body of rock and ice located 8 billion miles (13 billion kilometers) from Earth. They had named the object Sedna after the Inuit goddess of the ocean. Sedna was the largest object found in the solar system since Pluto’s discovery in 1930. However, astronomers reported that they could not designate Sedna as a planet because, like Pluto, Sedna is too smallwith an estimated diameter of 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers)and possesses an irregular orbit. The scientists stated that the discovery might also have been the first observation of a region called the Oort Cloud, which is located outside of Pluto’s orbit. Astronomers had long hypothesized the existence of this region of small frozen objects, the source of comets that enter Earth’s solar system. The team had discovered Sedna using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the California Institute of Technology’s Palomar Observatory.(NASA, “Most Distant Object in Solar System Discovered,” news release 04-091, 15 March 2009; Thomas H. Maugh II, “Scientists Discover Icy Planetoid Beyond Pluto,” Los Angeles Times, 16 March 2009.)
ISS crew members E. Michael Fincke and Gennady I. Padalka performed a spacewalk to conduct maintenance tasks and to prepare the ISS for the future arrival of a new cargo spacecraft. During the nearly 51⁄2-hour spacewalk, Fincke and Padalka replaced a component of the ISS’s cooling system, installed safety equipment for future spacewalks, and set up three antennas to aid the docking of ESA’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), a new ISS cargo ship scheduled for launch in 2005.(NASA, “International Space Station Status Report: SS04-029,” news release SS04-029, 3 September 2004.)
Edward J. Weiler became Director of NASA’s GSFC, taking over from Alphonso V. Diaz.

NASA announced that it would remove the potentially problematic foam insulation ramps from the Space Shuttles’ external fuel tanks before the next Shuttle launch, which NASA had scheduled for 2006. NASA had examined the foam ramps after a portion of foam had separated from Discovery during its July 2005 launch, nearly striking the Shuttle. The event was similar to the one that had contributed to the destruction of Columbia in 2003. Engineers had designed the foam ramps―formally called Protuberance Air Loads (PALs)―to protect Shuttle tanks’ fuel- pressurization lines and electrical cables from potentially damaging winds during launch. NASA technicians remained unsure of why the foam ramp had separated from Discovery, but inspections conducted in November 2005 had revealed small cracks in a PAL. The PAL with the cracks was on a tank that NASA had tested before Discovery’s launch but had not used for that mission.(Warren E. Leary, “NASA Plans To Remove Some Foam from Shuttle,” New York Times, 16 December 2005; Michael Cabbage, “Shuttle To Lose Fuel-Tank Foam,” Orlando Sentinel (FL), 16 December 2005.)

NASA announced the completion of the most extensive global topographic map ever created, using data collected during Endeavour’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in February 2000. NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) had processed the collected data for more than four years, creating digital elevation maps that encompassed 80 percent of Earth’s landmass and revealed, for the first time, large, detailed swaths of topography previously obscured by persistent cloud cover. The data covered Australia and New Zealand in unprecedented, uniform detail, as well as the more than 1,000 islands comprising much of Polynesia and Melanesia in the South Pacific and the islands in the South Indian and Atlantic oceans, including many that geographers had never topographically mapped. The low topography typical of the islands makes them vulnerable to tidal effects, storm surges, and long- term rise in sea level. Mission Project Scientist at NASA’s JPL, Michael Kobrick, remarked that the maps would help mitigate the effects of future disasters of the magnitude of the Indian Ocean tsunami, because scientists would now be able to see where rising waters would go. Kobrick also commented that the SRTM was among the most significant missions the Shuttle had performed and, probably, the most significant mapping mission of any single type.(NASA, “NASA Goes ‘Down Under’ for Shuttle Mapping Mission Finale,” news release 05-007, 6 January 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/jan/HQ_05007_srtm_update.html (accessed 11 May 2009).)
Officials of the Personal Spaceflight Federation announced the newly formed organization’s establishment. The Federation’s stated purpose was to design and uphold the standards and processes necessary to ensure public safety, while promoting the growth of the private spaceflight industry. Pursuant to landmark legislation signed by President George W. Bush in December 2004Pub. L. No. 108-492, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004the industry group planned to work with federal regulators to draft rules and standards for suborbital space tourism. The new federation brought together visionary space entrepreneurs, including SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan, whose team had won the US$10 million X Prize in October 2004 for conducting the first private suborbital spaceflight, and video-game developer John D. Carmack II, whose Armadillo Aerospace team had been among the leading contenders for the X Prize. Executive Director of the X Prize Foundation Gregg E. Maryniak, serving as the Federation’s spokesperson, remarked on the law’s new mandate that government and industry work together to develop safety standards. Maryniak stated that the Federation believed strongly that private industry must devise a suborbital product considerably safer than that of the current civil space program.(Personal Spaceflight Federation, “Space Entrepreneurs Resolve To Create Industry Group To Promote Safety Standards and Growth of the Personal Spaceflight Industry,” news release, 8 February 2005, http://www.commercialspaceflight.org/pressreleases/PSF%20Press%20Release%20- %20Original%20Announcement.pdf (accessed 27 August 2009); Alan Boyle, “Space Racers Unite in Federation: Industry Group Will Follow Up on New Law,” MSNBC.com, 9 February 2005, http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6936543/ (accessed 28 August 2009).)
A group of astronomers led by Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology announced the discovery of a new planet in the solar system. The scientists had temporarily called the planet 2003 UB313 until the International Astronomic Union could formally approve the name that the scientists had proposed, but had not yet disclosed to the public. Although the scientists did not yet know the planet’s exact size, they believed it was larger than Pluto, which astronomers estimate is 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) in diameter. In addition, the newly discovered planet, which the scientists believed to be composed of rock and ice, was the furthest known object in the solar system, with a 560-year elliptical orbit around the Sun at distances ranging from 3.3 to 9 billion miles (5.3 to 14 billion kilometers) from the Sun. By comparison, Pluto’s orbit ranges from 2.7 to 4.6 billion miles (4.3 to 7.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun. The astronomers had also discovered that the orbit of 2003 UB313 is quite different from that of most planets in the solar system―it possesses an orbit skewed at an angle 44o from Earth’s orbit, whereas most planets orbit in planes that are close to that of Earth.(Kenneth Chang and Dennis Overbye, “Planet or Not, Pluto Has Far-Out Rival,” New York Times, 30 July 2005; NASA, “World Book at NASA: Pluto,” http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/pluto_worldbook.html (accessed 2 July 2009); Richard A. Kerr, “Newfound ‘Tenth Planet’ Puts Pluto Behind the Eight Ball,” Science 309, 5736 (5 August 2005): 859.)
An independent scientific panel, convened by the National Academy of Sciences’ (NAS’s) NRC, issued a report evaluating the results of a controversial 1999 study conducted by climatologist Michael E. Mann. Mann and his researchers had concluded that the warming of the Northern Hemisphere during the last decades of the twentieth century had no precedent within the past 1,000 years, and that the 1990s—particularly 1998—were the warmest years during that period. The study included a graph that had acquired the nickname “hockey stick,” becoming an environmentalist icon. The graph depicted little temperature variation in the Northern Hemisphere for almost 1,000 years, followed by a sharp upward hook representing recent rising temperatures. NAS had prepared the report, Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years, at the request of House Science Committee Chairman Sherwood L. Boehlert (R- NY). The panel had found “sufficient evidence from tree rings, retreating glaciers, and other ‘proxies’ of past surface temperatures to say with a high level of confidence that the last few decades of the twentieth century were warmer than any comparable period in the last 400 years.” Although this conclusion vindicated the main argument of Mann’s study for the most part, the panel cautioned that scientists had found less empirical evidence proving that Northern Hemisphere warming had no precedent before 1600. The panel also stated that “because of larger uncertainties in temperature reconstructions for decades and individual years, and because not all proxies record temperatures for such short timescales,” they had less confidence in the team’s conclusions about the 1990s.
NASA’s Deep Impact team of scientists, led by Michael F. A’Hearn of the University of Maryland, reported in the online edition of Science that they had found the first conclusive evidence of water ice on the surface of a comet. Jointly sponsored by NASA’s JPL and the University of Maryland, Deep Impact had crashed a space probe into the comet Tempel 1 on 4 July 2005 and had taken samples of the resulting debris. Through a spectral analysis of data about the comet, which the probe had collected before the crash, the scientists had determined the existence of three patches of ice covering 300,000 square feet (27,871 square meters), approximately 6 percent of Tempel 1’s total surface area. The team concluded that the exposed ice had come from larger reservoirs just below the comet’s surface. While scientists had long known that ice is a component of comets, this report marked the first discovery of ice on a comet’s exterior surface. Scientists speculate that comets might have been the first vector for the delivery of water and carbon-based molecules to Earth, providing the building blocks for life.(Reuters, “Deep Impact Probe Shows Ice on Comet’s Surface,” 2 February 2006; Brown University, “NASA’s ‘Deep Impact’ Team Reports First Evidence of Cometary Ice,” press release, 2 February 2006, http://www.brown. edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2005-06/05-072.html (accessed 27 August 2010); Ker Than, “Water Ice Detected on Comet’s Surface,” Space.com, 2 February 2006, http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/060202_comet_ice.html (accessed 31 August 2010); see also Jessica M.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics to NASA scientist John C. Mather and University of California, Berkeley, scientist George F. Smoot. The pair received the award for research that strongly supported the Big Bang Theory as the definitive explanation of the universe’s origin. Mather and Smoot had used data from NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) to observe the universe 380,000 years after its inception. They had determined that the temperature of the cosmic microwave background—essentially, the Big Bang’s afterglow—was approximately -455oF. Their observations matched earlier predictions made by other scientists and indicated that nearly all of the universe’s radiant energy—the energy of light and other electromagnetic waves—had been released during the first year after the Big Bang. The pair also discovered slight temperature variations in this relatively uniform light, indicating the density differences in matter that had led to the creation of stars, galaxies, and the universe’s hierarchical structure.(Nobel Foundation, “The Nobel Prize in Physics 2006,” 3 October 2006, http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/ physics/laureates/2006/press.html (accessed 31 March 2010); NASA, “NASA Scientist John C.

The House Science Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics held a hearing on an NRC report recommending a strategy for the federal government’s involvement in civil aeronautics, with particular emphasis on NASA’s future research priorities. The NRC had released the report, Decadal Survey of Civil Aeronautics: Foundation for the Future, in June 2006. Major General William W. Hoover, co-chair of NRC’s Committee on the Decadal Survey, testified that the NRC report would provide the executive branch with a “useful foundation” for developing a national aeronautics policy. Hoover urged NASA to allocate funding for research and technology more equitably, between NASA personnel and universities or industry, and to facilitate collaborative research with other federal agencies supporting aeronautics research, such as the FAA. Lisa J. Porter, Associate Administrator for NASA’s Aeronautics Mission Directorate, testified that NASA’s aeronautics-research portfolio aligned closely with the research priorities outlined in the report. Porter also stated that, although NASA had worked with private industry in aeronautics research, NASA did not want to duplicate private-sector research or to pursue research that private industry was better equipped to conduct.(U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, The National Academy of Sciences’ Decadal Plans for Aeronautics: A Blueprint for NASA? 109th Cong., 2nd sess., 26 September 2006 (statement of Lisa J.

NASA awarded its Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal posthumously to astronomer and astrophysicist John N. Bahcall, who had died in August 2005 of a rare blood disorder. NASA honored Bahcall for his work developing the HST, along with astronomers Lyman S. Spitzer Jr. and George B. Field, and for his “extraordinary service to NASA’s astronomy program,” including “groundbreaking work in the 1960s toward explaining the scientific mysteries of the sun.” Bahcall had also received the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, and the National Medal of Science.(NASA, “NASA Honors Distinguished Astronomer with Medal,” news release 06-005, 10 January 2006, http://nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/jan/HQ_06005_Bahcall_AAS_Award.html (accessed 14 September 2009).)
NASA released images that its New Horizons spacecraft had captured 28 February 2007, when the craft passed within 1.4 million miles (2.2 million kilometers) of Jupiter on its way to Pluto. The images provided “never-before-seen perspectives” of the giant planet’s atmosphere, rings, moons, and magnetosphere, including the first close-up scans of Jupiter’s second-largest storm Little Red Spot, which had formed during the previous decade when three smaller storms merged. Harold A. Weaver Jr., New Horizons Project Scientist for the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, remarked that the image was “the best look ever of a storm like this in its infancy.” New Horizons had also captured the clearest images to date of the tenuous Jovian ring system, including images revealing a series of unexpected arcs and clumps
NASA announced that it had awarded a total of US$97,000 in prizes at the 2008 General Aviation Technology Challenge, one of NASA’s seven Centennial Challenges offering technology prize competitions for independent inventors. The General Aviation Technology Challenge took place from 4 August 2008 through 10 August 2008 at the Sonoma County Airport in Santa Rosa, California. The contest encouraged inventors to design aircraft that were easier to fly, less expensive, safer, and less of a disturbance to both the environment and the communities surrounding airports. NASA provided the prize money, and the Comparative Aircraft Flight Efficiency (CAFE) Foundation managed the contest. Frank Vance Turner’s team from El Dorado Hills, California, won the largest prize, a US$50,000 purse for the airplane with the best safety features. Turner’s team also won prizes for the shortest takeoff distance and best angle of climb. In addition, the Turner team shared a prize for lowest cabin noise with John A. Dunham’s team from Carson City, Nevada. Dunham’s team also won the community noise prize. John Robert “Bob” Basham won a prize for the best glide ratio. NASA had offered a US$50,000 prize for any aircraft with a fuel efficiency of less than 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) per gallon, but none of the contestant aircraft met the requirement. NASA planned to use the unawarded prize money in the 2009 competition.(NASA, “Prizes Awarded at NASA’s General Aviation Technology Challange,” news release 08-206, 12 August 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/aug/HQ_08206_Centennial_Challenges_ Cafe_400_Winners.html (accessed 7 July 2011).)
A team of scientists led by Hope A. Ishii and John P. Bradley of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announced in the journal Science that material they had analyzed from the comet Wild 2 more closely resembled the material composition of an asteroid than they had expected. Using Livermore’s scanning transmission electron microscope SuperSTEM, the scientists had assessed a sample of the comet’s tail—NASA’s Stardust craft had gathered the sample in 2004. Scientists had long thought that primitive outer nebula material composed comets, so the Livermore team had expected to find an abundance of that material. However, they had found very little primitive outer nebula material, instead finding larger-than-expected quantities of the newer, inner solar nebula matter common in asteroids. The researchers pointed out that this surprising discovery emphasized that asteroids and comets do not comprise distinctly different entities but, instead, exist along a continuum in regard to their material composition.(John Johnson Jr., “NASA’s Stardust Upends Comet Theory,” Los Angeles Times, 25 January 2008; see also Hope A. Ishii et al., “Comparison of Comet 81P/Wild 2 Dust with Interplanetary Dust from Comets,” Science 319, no. 5862 (25 January 2008): 447−450.)
