Current positive control base was between 5486 and 18 288 m (18 000 and 60 000 ft) over northeastern and north central U.S. and between 7315 and 18 288 m (24 000 and 60 000 ft) over remainder of conterminous 48 states, (faa Release 71-50)
NAS held meeting on molecular constitutions of interstellar space. Dr. William J. Welch, Univ. of California at Berkeley astronomer, said 23 different molecules had been detected in interstellar space. Dr. Arno A. Penzias of Bell Telephone Laboratories said new radiotelescope at Kitt Peak, Ariz., had detected amount of carbon monoxide that “covers vast regions of space.” Detected carbon seemed “to play a disproportionately large role.” Dr. Benjamin M. Zuckerman of Univ. of Maryland said it might be possible that carbon monoxide was formed in shells around very young and very old stars from which it was ejected into space.

Development of surgical implement to simplify cataract removal with high-frequency vibration and pump to liquify and remove cataract and lens material was announced by LeRC. Hand-held instrument— developed by four-man LeRC team in cooperative program with Dr. William J. McGannon, prominent Cleveland eye surgeon—had been successfully tested on animals. NASA was seeking patent on instrument, which would reduce cataract operation time and patient’s convalescent period by minimizing stitching problem in most cases. Instrument made only small puncture, (nasa Release 71-203)
Lenc had turned over to St. Vincent Charity Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, small analog computer designed by LeRC scientists Vernon D. Gebben and John A. Webb, Jr., at cost of $1500, NASA announced. Computer measured increase or decrease of stroke volume of heart, or changes in length of time heart valves remained open, to detect certain abnormalities early in development. Hospital planned to use computer experimentally before application to human patients recovering from open heart surgery, (nasa Release 71-69)
NASA’s M2-F3 lifting-body vehicle, piloted by NASA test pilot William H. Dana, reached 20 400-m (67 000-ft altitude) and mach I.	05 during ninth flight from frc. Objectives were to determine aileron effectiveness at speed greater than mach 0.9, obtain stability and control data at mach 0.95 and 0.90, expand flight envelope, and evaluate speed brake.
