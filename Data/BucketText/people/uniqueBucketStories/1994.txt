The Pentagon announced that Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition John Deutch had agreed to hold $10 million in Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funding pending the outcome of a Department of Defense (DoD) launch modernization study and a 60-day NASA-DoD review of the Delta Clipper-Experimental (DC-X) flight test program.

Scientist John Bradley of MVA Inc. in Norcross, Georgia, said in a report in the journal Science that ancient space dust particles, composed of a black glassy substance embedded with metal, that zipped into Earth's atmosphere might be older than the solar system. Some of these tiny dust grains appeared to be similar to one of the major raw materials of the universe, interstellar dust grains, known as GEMS (glass with embedded metal and sulfides). Scientists collected GEMS, which they believed were left from a passing comet's wake, from a NASA U-2 airplane several miles above Earth. The GEMS were rare--only one or two were collected per hour of U-2 flight time--but showed signs of exposure to irradiation when studied under a transmission electron miscroscope. (UP, Aug 11/94)
