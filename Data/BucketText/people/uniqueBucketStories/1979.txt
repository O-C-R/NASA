NASA announced creation of a new Headquarters program office called Space Transportation System Operations, headed by an associate administrator not yet appointed, to be responsible for Shuttle operations including scheduling, pricing, launch-service agreements, the Spacelab program, and expendable launch vehicles (except Shuttle upper stages). Dr. Robert A. Frosch said the move would centralize Shuttle services in a user-oriented organization. The former Office of Space Transportation Systems (STS) was renamed Office of Space Transportation System Acquisition; John Yardley would continue as associate administrator for STS development and acquisition, including the Shuttle and its upper stages, associated ground facilities and equipment, and system improvements.

NASA declared the launch of Comstar C on June 29, 1978, to be successful. Put into a transfer orbit by an Atlas Centaur at the Eastern Test Range (ETR), the spacecraft on July 1 successfully fired its apogee motor to go into the desired synchronous orbit. The assessment was signed January 12 by Joseph B. Mahon, director of the expendable launch-vehicle program in the Office of Space Transportation Systems, and by John F. Yardley, associate administrator for space transportation systems. (NASA MOR M-491-201-78-03 [postlaunch] Jan 16/79).
NASA declared successful the May 4 launch of FltSatCom 2 from ETR on an Atlas Centaur into a transfer orbit. An apogee kick motor fired May 6 had put the spacecraft into the desired synchronous orbit. All spacecraft systems were operating normally. John F. Yardley declared November 1 that NASA objectives had been accomplished. (NASA MOR M-491-202-79-02 [postlaunch] Nov 5/79)
