Edward J. Weiler became Director of NASA’s GSFC, taking over from Alphonso V. Diaz. Weiler, who had joined NASA in 1978, had served as Chief Scientist for the HST from 1979 to 1998 and as Associate Administrator for NASA’s Space Science Enterprise from 1998 to July 2004. Diaz, who had served as Director of GSFC since 12 January 1998, became NASA’s Associate Administrator of Science.(NASA History Division, “NASA Center Directors,” http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/ director.html (accessed 1 May 2009); NASA, “Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate: Edward J.

ISS crew members E. Michael Fincke and Gennady I. Padalka performed a spacewalk to conduct maintenance tasks and to prepare the ISS for the future arrival of a new cargo spacecraft. During the nearly 51⁄2-hour spacewalk, Fincke and Padalka replaced a component of the ISS’s cooling system, installed safety equipment for future spacewalks, and set up three antennas to aid the docking of ESA’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), a new ISS cargo ship scheduled for launch in 2005.(NASA, “International Space Station Status Report: SS04-029,” news release SS04-029, 3 September 2004.)
NASA-funded researchers announced that they had found the most distant object orbiting the Sun yet discovered. Michael E. Brown of the California Institute of Technology had led a team of scientists to discover a small body of rock and ice located 8 billion miles (13 billion kilometers) from Earth. They had named the object Sedna after the Inuit goddess of the ocean. Sedna was the largest object found in the solar system since Pluto’s discovery in 1930. However, astronomers reported that they could not designate Sedna as a planet because, like Pluto, Sedna is too smallwith an estimated diameter of 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers)and possesses an irregular orbit. The scientists stated that the discovery might also have been the first observation of a region called the Oort Cloud, which is located outside of Pluto’s orbit. Astronomers had long hypothesized the existence of this region of small frozen objects, the source of comets that enter Earth’s solar system. The team had discovered Sedna using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the California Institute of Technology’s Palomar Observatory.(NASA, “Most Distant Object in Solar System Discovered,” news release 04-091, 15 March 2009; Thomas H. Maugh II, “Scientists Discover Icy Planetoid Beyond Pluto,” Los Angeles Times, 16 March 2009.)
