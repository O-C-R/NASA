In Houston Post Edward W. O’Brien cited need for definition of future national space effort, pointing out that "the mighty industry-government team that has been mobilized for manned flight is tapering off.” Employment, at the peak, had been 400,000; by the end of 1967, total would be 200,000; by 1968, only 100,000. What the U.S. must soon determine is "whether this unique assembly of brainpower and mechanical skill should be held together, or whether it should be applied elsewhere to better public advantage.” (Houston Post, 8/16/66)

Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.), emphasizing the need for expanded efforts in the field of oceanography, said before the National Space Club in Washington, D.

He noted the recent NASA-Naval Oceanographic Office agreement whereby noo would coordinate all investigations about possible applications of manned earth orbital operations in the field of oceanography. He suggested that this program "be expanded formally to include unmanned operations as well.” He urged a national program with national goals, "coordinated by one agency like . . .

A new nuclear particle—the most massive and most stable yet found— had been discovered by physicists at Argonne National Laboratory (anl). Three and a half times as heavy as the proton, the particle wa9 "a 'nucleon resonance’ known simply as N*3245.” The number "3245” stood for 3,245 million electron volts, the amount of its energy. According to Dr. Alan D. Krisch of Univ. of Michigan, nucleon resonances "may be 'excited’ or highly energetic states of protons and neutrons . . . and can be produced only in accelerators. They are not observed in nature.” Krisch, along with John R. O’Fallon, Keith Ruddick, and Steven W. Kormanyos of Univ. of Michigan, and Lazarus G.	Ratner of anl, made the discovery using Argonne’s 13.5-billion electron volt (Bev) zero gradient synchrotron. They said this "abnormally stable” particle has a lifetime of one ten-thousandth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a second, which is "longer than that of any of its family of nuclear particles.” Krisch suggested N*3245 may have "an unusually high spin which prevents it from decaying easily.” Discovery was reported in Physical Review Letters.

Past measurements of microwave emissions from Venus had indicated very high surface temperatures. Plummer and Strong concluded, on the basis of recent detailed measurements from high-altitude balloon observations by Cal Tech radioastronomers, that possibly "30 percent of the observed microwaves in the past had no bearing on surface temperatures but rather emanated from electrical discharges within the cloudy atmosphere of Venus.” They estimated Venus’ temperature ranges from 580°F ai equator to 9°F at poles and said there are extensive regions—greater than earth’s land area—"where man would find the temperature comfortable.” (NYT, 4/18/66, 4; Wash.
