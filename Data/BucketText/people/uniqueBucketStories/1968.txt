XB—70 research aircraft was flown to 15,500-mi altitude by Col. Joseph F. Cotton (usaf) and NASA test pilot Fitzhugh L.

Low-speed, gear-down handling qualities, propulsion system, and performance tests were accomplished during 2-hr 30-min flight from Edwards afb. (XB—70 Proj Off)
Commenting on James E. Webb’s retirement, Sen. John Stennis (D-Miss.) said on Senate floor, “I have been a member of the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences since about the time Mr. Webb was appointed to head NASA. I am not given unduly to praise a man. I am not impressed by a title. I am impressed by a record. But I am certainly impressed with the fact that Mr. Webb carried out his responsibilities for nasa with an expenditure of $34 billion, in what might be called a crash program; and I have not seen any evidence of any activity of his except that clothed in the highest degree with integrity, honesty, frankness and openness in his dealings with the committee, with Congress, as well as with the public.” (CR, 10/8/68, S12227—8)
nasa test pilot William H.

arc scientists Dr. William L. Quaide and Verne R. Oberbeck had developed method of calculating lunar soil depths using measurements based on Lunar Orbiter photos and Surveyor photos and surface analyses, nasa announced. Studies indicated that many of moon’s smaller craters and much of soil and fragmental material on lunar surface were result of meteoroid impacts. By simulating impacts in laboratory and comparing results with photos of lunar craters scientists identified four crater types: (1) craters with up to 12-ft dia, round bottoms, and depths 25% of their diameter; (2) craters with 12- to 22-ft dia, flat bottoms, and central mound; (3) craters with 22- to 30-ft dia, flat bottoms, and no mound; and (4) craters with diameter greater than 30 ft with second crater gouged in flat bottom. Thick layer of fragmented material, calculated by new method to be up to 20 yd deep, coincided with densely cratered areas to support impact theory, (nasa Release 68—59; SBD, 4/5/68, 202)

Sudden affirmative response by U.S.S.R. to President Johnson’s longstanding offer for discussion of limiting missiles may have substantial meaning, said William S. White in Washington Post. “If this should turn out to be the case it would be ironic, indeed. It would mean that only after renouncing his office had the President been able to convince the Russians . . . that this country was honestly prepared to make accommodations with Moscow, so long as they were realistic and enforceable accommodations to reduce a possibility of nuclear holocaust that still hangs over the world and will so hang whatever may or may not happen in the Vietnams.” ( W Post, 7/1/68, A21)

Lightweight plastic foam invented by ARC scientists Dr. John A. Parker and Salvatore Riccitiello showed promise for industrial fire protection, particularly fuel fires. Extremely light polyurethane with additives formed tough, protective char layer when exposed to flame, while simultaneously releasing fire-extinguishing gases which helped to quench flame. Used to fill airspaces within structures, foam would prevent oxygen from reaching and feeding a fire. Demonstrations had shown it suitable for fire protection in aircraft, spacecraft, homes, and other structures. Other possible uses included automobiles, boats, trains, oil refineries, paint and chemical processing, and laboratories. Foam was resistant to heat flow, making it an excellent insulator, (nasa Release 68-187)

Analysis of data returned by Pioneer VIII had led arc scientists to speculate that earth’s magnetic tail, extension of its magnetic envelope (magnetosphere) blown out by solar wind to resemble comet’s tail, might be shorter than the 200 million mi suggested by certain theoretical calculations. When Pioneer VII flew through tail region at 3.5-million-mi distance from earth after Aug. 17, 1966, launch, it found long period when solar wind was completely or partially blocked out, suggesting spacecraft had observed end of organized tail region. Conditions encountered in tail area by Pioneer VIII at 1.75 million mi from earth after Dec. 13, 1967, launch, were similar. However, instead of smooth cylindrical structure expected at smaller distance, Pioneer VIII found conditions resembling turbulent wake, leading some scientists to conclude tail was shorter. Others, including Pioneer Project Scientist, Dr. John Wolfe, believed tail might include successively turbulent and smooth areas, (arc Astrogram, 6/20/68; AP, NYT, 6/22/68, 53)

NASA was conducting three separate studies to determine reasons for failures of May 18 launch of Nimbus B, Aug. 10 launch of Ats IV, and Sept. 18 launch of Intelsat III—-which had brought its launch record down to 0.500 average. Before May failure, agency had compiled “almost incredible” launch record, said Thomas O’Toole in Washington Post. Sources close to NASA had said agency was conducting fourth investigation to determine whether there was “something systemic at the root of the trouble.” One theory was that decline in NASA launch activity in 1968, with 42 attempted launches thus far compared to 69 at same time in 1967, had caused similar drop in attention to detail. Second theory was that layoffs and turnover in launch crews had cut down efficiency and introduced element of inexperience. Third theory was that nasa was suffering from “a sudden case of overconfidence brought on by its long string of launch successes.” Seven-man hoard to investigate failure of first Intelsat III mission met for organization session. Board, convened by Dr. John E. Naugle, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, would have five observers in addition to seven voting members and would be chaired by Daniel G.

U.S.S.R.’s Zond V automatic research station had apparently suffered series of errors during reentry that could have been fatal if men had been on board, John Lannan reported in Washington Evening Star. According to one unidentified U.S. source, Zond V had entered atmosphere and “skipped” back out as planned, but then skipped along top of atmosphere and reentered “at a peculiar angle.” Reentry caused g forces and heat loads that would have been fatal to crews if aboard, and spacecraft landed thousands of miles short of its intended landing area, which was probably on land in Soviet territory. Chicago Tribune later supported theory that Zond V’s reentry was a disaster and reported that U.S. sources said evidence indicated spacecraft had: (1) failed to circle as close to moon as intended, and was thus unable to obtain useful photos of possible landing sites; (2) reentered earth’s atmosphere at angle much steeper than planned, causing friction temperatures that would have killed cosmonauts; and (3) landed in water accidentally instead of in Soviet territory as planned.
