Capt. Edward V. Rickenbacker (U.S. Army Air Corps, Ret.), the most decorated U.S. pilot of World War I, died in Zurich, Switzerland, after a heart attack at age 82. One of the top automobile racing drivers in the U.S. by the age of 21, Rickenbacker enlisted in the Air Service at the start of World War I. He received the Croix de Guerre with four palms, Legion of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross with nine Oak Leaf Clusters, Medal of Merit, and the Congressional Medal of Honor for downing 26 German aircraft and at least 4 enemy balloons. He became General Manager of Eastern Airlines, Inc., in 1934, and the same year piloted a Douglas airliner from Los Angeles to Newark, N.J., in 12 hrs 3 min 50 sec for a coast-to-coast passenger aircraft record. He was President and General Manager of Eastern Airlines, from 1938 to 1953, when he became Chairman of the Board. He retired in 1963 and was elected to the Aviation Hall of Fame in 1965. Throughout his life Rickenbacker had advocated greater use of military aircraft. In 1922 he supported his friend Gen. Billy Mitchell in urging a separate U.S. Government department for aeronautics. Following Rickenbacker’s death, President Nixon issued a statement: “ ‘Captain Eddie’ Rickenbacker was an American original—a celebrated racing car driver in the early years of the 20th Century, the leading American fighter pilot in World War I, a pioneer of commercial aviation, and a generous, patriotic citizen in both war and peace.” (Hailey, W Past, 7/24/73, C4; PD, 7/30/73, 924)
Establishment of the lunar data analysis and synthesis program was announced by NASA. Scientists throughout the world would be invited to propose investigations drawing on a variety of lunar data and cutting across a number of scientific disciplines to build a detailed picture of the moon’s origin, history, and characteristics. The knowledge would carry implications for other solar system planets, including the earth, and would provide the basis for future mission planning and broad dissemination of new knowledge to the public. The program would be conducted by the Lunar Programs Div., headed by William T. O’Bryant, in the Office of Space Science. (NASA Release 73-50)

Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering in the Dept, of Defense, testified before the Senate Committee on Armed Services on the Soviet thrust for military and technological superiority: “The United States reacted to one Soviet technological advance—the Sputnik—with a successful ten-year effort to restore our technological superiority in space. Now we are lagging again in some technology areas and it may well require another decade after some new jolt before the United States regains an acceptable technological posture.” The U.S.S.R. was “at such levels of technical competence in broad areas of defense technology that technological breakthroughs of major significance are possible. They could seriously destabilize the balance of world power and weaken our strength for deterrence and negotiations. They could encourage military opportunism in any of a number of areas and raise the risk of war or armed confrontation.” (Testimony)

A Science editorial commented on the resignation of President Nixon’s Science Adviser, Dr. Edward A. David, Jr. [see Jan. 3]: The resignation and “likelihood that the office of the President’s science adviser will be abolished come as a disappointing shock. David is a scientist-engineer of very broad competence who maintained intellectual integrity in the emotional heat of politics.” Abolition of office was “one of many consequences of President Nixon’s determination to reorganize the Executive Office of the President.” It was probable that the President’s Science Advisory Committee and the Office of Science and Technology “would vanish” in reorganization. Criticism of Presidential Science Advisers had been “that they often became so involved in the day-to-day fighting of political brush fires that they lost sight of the forest.” The scientific establishment had fought against creation of a Dept, of Science. “It has been argued that science and technology permeate the activities of virtually all executive agencies and that centralization would not be wise. The argument had been driven home too well. In consequence, there is now danger that science, while being everywhere, will be nowhere.” (Abelson, Science, 1/19/73, 9)
