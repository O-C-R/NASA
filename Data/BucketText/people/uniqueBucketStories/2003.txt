X Prize contestant SpaceShipOne successfully carried out its first glide flight after the White Knight carrier craft towed it to an altitude of 47,000 feet (14,326 meters) and released it. Pilot Michael W. Melvill guided the craft to a desert landing. Scaled Composites, which had built SpaceShipOne, issued a report of the test indicating that the two vehicles had separated cleanly, that handling qualities of the craft had correlated closely with ground-based simulations, and that on-board avionics and cockpit displays had performed flawlessly.(Leonard David, “X Prize Contestant Scaled Composites’ SpaceShipOne Flies,” Space News, 9 August 2003.)
NASA scientist Robert Michael Hornstein died of a brain tumor at the age of 57. Hornstein had worked for NASA since 1968, directing its worldwide network of antennas used for communicating with orbiting spacecraft. Hornstein, who had joined NASA during the Apollo program to design programs for ground tracking systems, was “recognized for helping save the Apollo 9 mission from being aborted shortly after launch when he modified tracking software to compensate for a computer malfunction in the launch vehicle.” As Ground Networks Director, Hornstein had helped administer network-tracking facilities during Space Shuttle orbits, the Voyager program, the Galileo recovery effort and mission to Jupiter, the Magellan program, and the international Halley’s Comet tracking program. He had helped manage the upgrade of Deep Space Network facilities in Australia, California, and Spain and had acted as NASA’s primary representative in arranging cooperative tracking efforts with other countries. NASA had awarded Hornstein its Outstanding Leadership Award and Exceptional Service Medal, and the Soviet Union had honored him with membership in its Federation of Cosmonautics.(Washington Post, “Robert Hornstein; NASA Scientist Ran Tracking System,” 28 March 2003.)
