The new contract was for $5.63 billion. Assembly will begin in November 1997 with the launch of the U.S.-purchased Russian FGB �space tug� a power and propulsion module. It will be followed in December 1997 with Node 1, that would connect laboratory and crew modules and allow the Space Shuttle to dock. (NASA Releases 95-2 & 13; Space News, May 1/95; AvWk, Apr 10/95)
An air-safety computer system developed by NASA at its Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in 1985 had yet to be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. The Takeoff Performance Monitor was designed to help pilots handle takeoff mishaps more quickly and safely, but airlines, manufacturers, and Federal Aviation Administration officials said the cost and liability burdens outweighed the benefits. Troublesome takeoffs occur less than 1 percent of the time but account for 10 percent of all serious airplane accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. (CSM, Jan 6/95)

NASA�s Office of Space Access and Technology selected 12 research proposals for negotiation. The proposals are for Phase II contracts in NASA�s Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Pilot Program. The STTR program is similar to the Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIRP) but varies by requiring small business concerns to conduct cooperative research and development by partnering with a research institution. At least 40 percent of the work must be performed by the small business concern, and at least 30 percent of the work must be performed by the research institute. STTR and SBIRP comprise only some of the many research grants NASA awards each year. (NASA Releases 95-46, 103, 165, 174, 183, 199, 210 & 214)
Today is the first of three dates that the Earth will be able to view the rings of Saturn on edge in about 15 years. Thirteen of Saturn�s 18 moons were discovered during past ring crossings. The other two dates in this trio will be August 10, 1995 and February 11, 1996.

The United States and Russia began taking practical steps toward merging their manned space programs.  NASA expected to begin shuttle flights to the Mir Space Station as a step in a joint venture to build a space station. The agreement called for seven flights through 1997 in which U. S. space shuttles would dock with Mir and allow the exchange of crews. One shuttle mission in 1995 would supply solar arrays that would combine U.S. advanced photovoltaic technology with Russia's expertise in space structures and mechanisms in order to boost Mir's electrical output by six kilowatts.

A new generation of air traffic control tools are being field tested at the Denver International Airport. The Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) became its primary traffic management tool the day it opened on February 28. CTAS was designed with the involvement of the ultimate users, the controllers and the pilots. It consists of three software systems: the Decent Advisor (DA), an air/ground datalink system, and advanced cockpit automation. The DA has routinely met its goal of reducing arrival time prediction accuracy to under 20 seconds. In addition to reducing traffic controller workload, CTAS will increase aircraft fuel efficiency and reduce delays. The field tests are jointly conducted by NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which contemplate more such fruitful partnerships in the future.

NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin released a statement regarding the effects of the proposed five-year, $2.7 billion reduction. He essentially stated that the House of Representatives� FY96 budget resolution assumes massive cuts in NASA�s efforts to study the Earth. It would turn an integrated global program into a series of disconnected and fundamentally less effective measurements. The cuts would cripple the core of the program, the Earth Observing System. The U.S. government-in partnership with scientists, private companies, and other nations must ensure that this cutting-edge research that is the foundation of Mission to Planet Earth is continued. While NASA is committed to prudent and permanent deficit reduction, further cuts to Mission to Planet Earth(and environmental research in general(seriously jeopardize an investment in the future that will return economic and quality of life benefits far in excess of what we spend today.

Saturn�s possible two new Moons sighted by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on May 22 are thought instead to be orbiting clumps of icy rubble. Images from the August 10 �ring plane crossing� presented a new mystery. They seem to show at least three new objects, which are in different orbits than the two May objects. An explanation is that a shattered moonlet would be brighter and more visible, than when all of its mass was compressed into a single solid body. (NASA Releases 95-172; Science, Oct 20/95)

A Russian space enthusiast, Sergei Leskov, lamented the declining state of the Russian space program in the January 19 issue of "Izvestia." Production of rockets and other hardware has declined in the last few years, Leskov said, and even the hardware in orbit was on its last legs. The Mir space station, too, had grown old and increasingly gave mission controllers nasty surprises. He noted that during the past five years, funding of the space sector had been cut five-to-ten-fold in certain areas. The contract with the United States for construction of the Alpha space station had been the salvation of the Russian space sector, but only a small range of enterprises were involved in it, and the project did not promote development of new technologies. Without an infusion of more money, Leskov wrote, the Russian space sector could find itself as much a part of history as the Pyramid of Cheops. (BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, Jan 23/95).
