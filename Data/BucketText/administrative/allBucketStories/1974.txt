Dr. Dudley G. McConnell was appointed Assistant Associate Administrator for Applications by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator. Dr. Fletcher also announced the promotion of Dr. Harriett G. Jenkins to succeed Dr. McConnell as Assistant Administrator for Equal Opportunity. Dr. Jenkins had been Dr. McConnell’s deputy since February. The appointments would be effective 12 Aug. Dr. McConnell had spent 12 yrs in laboratory research at Lewis Research Center before coming to NASA Hq. in 1969. In his new position, he would he responsible for developing a coordinated planning capability and a system analysis function for the agency’s space applications program. Before joining NASA in Feh., Dr. Jenkins had been educational consultant for the Response to Educational Needs Project of the Anacostia District of Columbia schools, (nasa Release 74-217)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented nasa’s $3.247-billion FY 1975 budget request’ and program [see 4 Feb.] to the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences to open hearings on the nasa authorization bill. In a review of FY 1974 accomplishments, Dr. Fletcher pointed out that as the Skylab program came to an end the three crews had traveled some 113 million km and orbited the earth 2475 times in a working scientific laboratory—chalking up “about 100 miles per gallon of fuel.” Skylab had focused on the sun, the earth, and man. “Apollo extended man’s reach to the moon; Skylab added near-Earth to man’s domain.” In answer to questions Dr. Fletcher said the principal difference between nasa’s minimum request to the Office of Management and Budget and the final figures sent to Congress by the President was the $89 million subtracted from the shuttle program, causing a four- to six-month delay. Other differences brought a total decrease of $124 million below “what we could have gotten by with without any major changes” in nasa’s program. The proposed minimum budget would not have restored any of the programs nasa had had to drop because of FY 1974 budget cuts and therefore had been “well below the constant level” envisaged for nasa in FY 1973. Of $7.9 million cut from aeronautics programs, the chief reduction was in the quiet propulsion lift technology program, deleting the system integration model effort. Deletion of $1 million from the requested technology utilization increase canceled proposed increases in numbers of dissemination centers and reduced buildup of support to state and local governments. A $5.7-million cut in the amount requested for earth observations instruments had deferred their development. Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, said there had been “some discussions during the past several months” of an omb proposal to consolidate weather satellite programs under the Department of Defense. NASA, dod, omb, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had decided “to keep separate systems for the dod and NASA [with NOAa], but we will make maximum use” of hardware commonality in building satellites for them.

Columbia Broadcasting System newsman Walter Cronkite recalled the two most exalting moments in his years of TV space coverage, during an interview with the Christian Science Monitor. The first was “Alan Shepard’s little 15-minute plop-down into the Atlantic. Rocketry itself was so uncertain ... I just didn’t know whether or not I was going to he able to watch.” The second was the first lunar landing. “That was a highly emotional moment for me. The actual touchdown, not so much Neil Armstrong’s walk.” Cronkite, preparing for the TV documentary “Space: A Report to the Stockholders,” said he still believed the major achievement of the moon landing was that “it proves that we truly have the capability at this stage of man’s civilization to do any dam thing we want—the most outlandish or the most practical things.” Of course there were important spinoff values. “Probably one of the most important industrial spinoffs ... is the command that U.S. industry had gotten in the computer business. ... I attribute that almost solely to the space program.” Cronkite said that recent cutbacks in the manned program were proper. “It is just about where it ought to be— most of the concentration now is in unmanned satellites” and a deliberate, but not crash, program toward the reusable space shuttle. If newsmen were allowed to travel on the space shuttle, he’d go “on any flight they offered me.” When asked if he wouldn’t he missed by American TV viewers at blastoff, he said, “What do you mean. . . ? I hope to he broadcasting all the time from inside!” (CSM, 19 July 74)
A NASA plan for energy conservation and management, effective immediately, was outlined in a memo from Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, to heads of all program and staff offices and Center Directors. NASA expected to exceed by a wide margin the nationwide goal of a 5% reduction in energy consumption for the following 12-mo period as established in a 29 June 1973 Presidential Memorandum. Management actions included scheduling all energy resources, using fewer cars and aircraft, encouraging employee carpools, and examining alternative power sources in large energy consumers such as wind tunnels. NASA would also play a key role in the research, development, and technological application for the longer term solution of energy requirements and efficiencies. A Special Task Force on Energy Conservation, activated 10 Dec. 1973, would review and recommend . policies and guidelines on energy conservation, consider NASA’s response to external energy directives, develop suggestions for conserving energy, and review NASA’s progress in conservation.

Federal support to universities and colleges had declined 7%, to $3823 million, during FY 1973 in the first decline since 1970, the National Science Foundation reported. The drop had been largely the result of a $267-million decrease in funds from the Dept, of Health, Education, and Welfare but other significant decreases were posted by nsf, down $40 million; Dept, of Defense, down $11 million; and NASA, down $8 million. Federal funds for academic science activities totaled $2463 million, 5% below 1972. Two science fields had shown an increase in Federal r&d support between 1972 and 1973'. Life sciences’ $934 million was a 4% increase; engineering’s $204 million was up 6%. (nsf Highlights, 15 July 74) 15— 16 July: Western Union Telegraph Co.’s Westar 1—first U.S. domestic communications satellite, launched by NASA 13 April—began operations during inaugural ceremonies in New York and Los Angeles. Russell W. McFall, Chairman of the Board and President of Western Union Corp. transmitted the first message, from New York to Los Angeles, using the original Morse key to tap “What hath God wrought!” It was the same message sent by inventor Samuel F. B. Morse 24 May 1844 over the first experimental telegraph, a 65-km line between the Capitol in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Md. Regular commercial operations began 16 July, providing services for Westar J’s first two commercial customers, American Can Co. and Bank of America. (Westar Inaugural Transmission press kit, 15 July 74) 16— 29 July: NASA launched Aeros 2 (Aeros-B) aeronomy satellite for West Germany from Western Test Range at 4:51 am pdt on a four-stage Scout launch vehicle into polar orbit with an 879.0-km apogee, 221.3km perigee, 95.65-min period, and 97.44° inclination. The NASA mission objective—to place the Aeros 2 satellite in an earth orbit permitting successful achievement of the scientific objectives—was met and the mission was adjudged successful 26 July. The scientific objective was to measure the main aeronomic parameters of the upper atmosphere and the solar ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength band of the main absorption. The long-range objective of the satellite, which carried one Goddard Space Flight Center and four West German experiments, was to provide a model of the ionosphere from which upper atmospheric conditions could be predicted. By 29 July the vehicle and experiments were performing satisfactorily and the West Germans were initiating spacecraft operations. A July 1965 agreement between the U.S. and West Germany had provided for a series of cooperative satellite projects. The Aeros program, the second in the series, was authorized by a 10 June 1969 agreement and Aeros 1 was launched 16 Dec. 1972. The 1974 contract between NASA and the West Germany Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (bmft) for the Aeros 2 launch provided for reimbursement of NASA for launch vehicle and services. NASA would also provide one experiment, tracking, and backup for data acquisition, bmft was responsible for development of spacecraft and instrumentation operation and control of the satellite after launch, and data reduction and analysis except for the gsfc experiment. The spacecraft reentered 25 Sept. 1975. (nasa mors, 30 Nov 72, 8 & 29 July 74; NASA Releases 69-91, 74-183; gsfc SSR, 31 Oct 75) The 1969 launch of Apollo 11 was commemorated 16 July by ceremonies at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad A. At 9:32 am edt, the moment of launch, Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., unveiled a plaque designating the site a National Historical Landmark. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, told the thousands of guests: “No matter our achievements, ... we cannot relax our pursuit of knowledge, for we must face the coming crises of our time. Every effort must be made to see that the opportunity which our technology presents is not lost. We may be sure that the opportunity will not occur soon again, if ever. To fail now would mean a ravaged environment and depleted resources— a plunge into a new and terrible Dark Age from which there would be no return.” Unless “we continuously restore the fund of basic knowledge, we shall ultimately exhaust it. . . . “Some day we will establish scientific outposts on the Moon, and even tap its mineral resources. And in the not-too-distant future astronauts may tread the surface of Mars and the glaciers of the moons of Jupiter in search of extraterrestrial life. . . . The future began here at 9:32 a.m. on July 16, 1969. At that moment on July 16 in the year 2069, launch windows to Mars, Neptune, and Pluto will be open. Will we fly through those windows? I think we will.” In 19 July ceremonies at the San Clemente, Calif., Western White House, Armstrong presented President Nixon a plaque bearing the names of each astronaut who had represented “this country in a flight above the surface of the Earth.” President Nixon told Armstrong the greatest contribution to the space program was not the exploration or technology but the “spirit you and your colleagues . . . have had the opportunity to demonstrate.” The Smithsonian Institution hosted 20 July activities marking the day of the landing. Speaking on the Mall in Washington, D.C., Smithsonian Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks said Apollo 11 had been a “dramatic demonstration . . . that progress in human affairs does not spring full blown from the efforts of one man or group of men. What we saw was the culmination of the efforts of hundreds of scientists and engineers from Leonardo da Vinci ... to the Apollo 11 astronauts. Each built on what his predecessors had accomplished until the accumulation of knowledge made possible the kind of quantum leap forward represented by the Apollo Program.” Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, called the day of the landing “the day man ended an era of one-planet civilization and began a new age as traveler and colonizer of the universe.” Despite difficulties, men would “make more of these steps into the vast but exciting reaches of the solar system.” A 21 July service at the Washington Cathedral in Washington, D.C., dedicated the Space Window donated by Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator at the time of the landing. The window, designed by Rodney Winfield, depicted whirling orange, red, and white stars and orbiting planets on a deep blue and green field. A thin white trajectory, representing a manned spacecraft, emphasized man’s minuteness in God’s universe. During the ceremony, Armstrong presented a 7.18-g, 3.6-billion-yr-old lunar rock, brought from the moon by Apollo 11, to the Cathedral. The rock would be inserted into a hydrogen-filled plexiglass container embedded as the centerpiece of the window. (PD, 22 July 74, 815; NASA Activities, 15 Aug 74, 5-14; transcript; program)
The space shuttle would introduce a new mode oi space research in the 1980s, Dr. John E. Naugle, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator, said at a space transportation system press briefing in Washington, D.C. Sounding rockets gave the scientist an immediate return of data but only for a very short-duration flight. Satellites provided longer mission times but it might be five to seven years from the initiation of the project until data were received. Experiments flown on the shuttle could remain in orbit from 7 to 30 days and then be returned immediately for evaluation. This capability would be a powerful tool in the development of new technology. Dr. Myron S. Malkin, Space Shuttle Program Director, said NASA’s commitment to Congress called for a total development cost of $5.15 billion in 1971 dollars for two operational shuttle vehicles plus $10.5 million for each of 725 missions projected for 1980-1990. Mission costs would be shared by participating experimenters, and estimates were now running at $9.05 million per flight because of reduced estimates for external tank development. Cost for a shuttle flight, which could take 29 500 kg into orbit, contrasted with $18 million for a 4500-kg payload launched on an expendable Atlas booster and up to $58 million to orbit 14 000-18 000 kg on a Saturn IB. Shuttle development was on schedule; the first approach and landing tests were to be in the second quarter of 1977 and the first manned orbital flight in 1979. Orbiter manufacture was under way. The main engine oxygen burner had been tested 14 April and the first big engine firing was scheduled for the end of 1975. NASA would need a fleet of seven orbi-ters at $250 million each if the projected missions were flown. Elwood W. Land, Jr., of the Space Shuttle Systems Office said a 25-astronaut flight corps probably would be maintained to fly missions averaging more than one a week. LeRoy E. Day, Space Shuttle Program Deputy Director, reported the main engine was being designed to make 55 starts before refurbishment was necessary. Engine lifetime would be much longer. The solid boosters were being designed for 20 flights. Phillip E. Culbertson, Director of Mission and Payload Integration, said that all but the smallest expendable launch vehicles would be phased out about three years after the shuttle became operational.

The TV film “Houston, We Have a Problem” was criticized by former astronaut James A. Lovell, commander of the aborted Apollo 13 moonlanding mission (launched 11 April 1970), in a letter to the NASA Administrator, Dr. James C. Fletcher. The fictitious film focused on the personal lives of the Mission Control team that brought the crippled Apollo 13 spacecraft back to earth. Lovell said the film was “in poor taste”; the safe return of Apollo 13 was one of NASA’s finest hours and “it is not necessary to resort to soap opera plots to enliven the . . . story.” (Carmody, W Post, 1 March 74, C7)
John M. Thole had been appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Science effective 1 Sept., NASA announced. Thole would succeed Vincent L. Johnson, who had retired. Former project manager for the Applications Technology Satellite at Goddard Space Flight Center, Thole had joined gsfc in 1960 and had held a variety of project management positions since that time, (nasa Ann, 26 Aug 74) 26 August-20 September: Thirty NASA engineers and technicians met with U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences counterparts in Moscow as joint preparations for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project’s July 1975 flight continued. On 8 Sept, another group of 47 specialists and engineers headed by U.S. astp Technical Director Glynn S. Lunney arrived in Moscow for 2 weeks of meetings with the Soviet group headed by U.S.S.R. Technical Director Konstantin D. Bushuyev. The project directors announced plans for joint prelaunch tests at the U.S. launch site 1-8 Feb. 1975 and at the U.S.S.R. launch area 5-13 May 1975. Flight crews and technical specialists from both countries would participate. Soviet specialists also announced plans to fly a manned Soyuz mission to test ASTP-related systems. NASA would be informed of further details before the flight to permit tracking. Thirteen U.S. flight controllers were also spending two Weeks in Moscow beginning 15 Sept., meeting with Soviet controllers for familiarization and training, including briefings on Soviet Mission Control Center operations, Soyuz spacecraft systems, and the mission flight plan, (jsc astp Press Communique, 20 Sept 74; jsc Roundup, 13 Sept 74; jsc Release 74-250) year in space. Dr. G. D. Whedon of the National Institutes of Health stated that weightlessness could threaten capable musculo-skeletal functions during space flights lasting up to three years unless measures could be developed to prevent significant losses of calcium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Continued loss of calcium could cause astronauts to break their backs or legs and could promote formation of kidney stones. Dr. William E. Thornton, life scientist in the jsc Astronaut Office, reported that by Mission Day 3 all Skylab crewmen had lost more than 2000 cc (2 qts) of extravascular fluid from calf and thigh; at recovery, a sharp reversal was noted. The Thornton team suggested that the reason for the shift was the intrinsic and unopposed lower limb elasticity, which forced venous blood and other fluids toward the head. Other investigators reported that such cardiovascular changes as the heart’s decreased ventricular size and the suppression of red blood cell production was the body’s accommodation to weightlessness. These physiological changes had been the expected response to a lack of exertion; they reversed after the astronauts’ return to earth, (jsc Roundup, 30 Aug 74,1-2; JSC proj off, interview, 12 Aug 75; Altman, NYT, 1 Sept 74,14)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb, Head of the Transonic Aerodynamics Branch at Langley Research Center, a $25 000 cash award for his invention of the supercritical wing. The cash award, made in a NASA Hq. ceremony, was the largest ever made by NASA to an individual. An improved airfoil design, the supercritical wing would permit significant increases in the speed and range of supersonic aircraft without increased fuel consumption.

Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said in a speech at Utah State Univ. that he was “certain there is intelligent life somewhere in this universe, but probably not in this solar system.” Primary life would probably be found in our solar system, with Mars as the most likely candidate. The U.S.S.R. was expected to land a spacecraft on Mars within the next few weeks, but in an area not likely to have any life form. A NASA spacecraft would land on Mars in 1976 in the area most likely to have water. NASA intended to continue systematic exploration of the solar system and to search for extraterrestrial life.

“The only way to face the crisis of our times is through the advancement of science and technology,” Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said in an address to the Cal Tech Management Club. “The space program is at the forefront of the search for knowledge, ... of producing knowledge, ... of developing the technological capability which comes from this knowledge.” Yet, “among even the higher echelons of the American business community, lack of understanding rather than comprehension of space ventures is the prevailing frame of mind.” Dr. Low called for communication to the American people of how the space program increased understanding of the universe and man’s place in it, improved life on earth, and kept the country secure through scientific, technological, and economic strength, as well as international cooperation.

NASA announced the appointment of William C. Schneider as NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, effective 21 July. Schneider had served as both Acting Associate and Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight from 18 March to 17 May and had been Skylab Program Director from December 1968 until the end of the Skylab program, (nasa Ann, 19 July 74; NASA Release 74207)
The economic return from the U.S. space program amounted to 33% per year, exceeding the typical yield from investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate, Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., Johnson Space Center Director, said in a speech at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. at Blacksburg, Va. Among returns not immediately visible to the public were some 30000 inventions available by the end of the Apollo program. The price of Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite—surveying the earth since its launch 23 July 1972—was less than 50 cents per American. “Given its potential for aiding us in the coming years, who would not support a program that costs less than a . . . half-pound [one fourth kilogram] of ground beef?” Dr. Kraft estimated that the space shuttle, at an annual cost of $5 for each American, was an investment that would “pay, perhaps, the greatest return to future generations.” With such a vehicle we could not only perform a variety of scientific studies with immediate application to life on earth but build permanent, space stations and launch planetary vehicles and eventually starships. The space shuttle program, with its international cooperation, would unite “many nations for the benefit of all.” (Text)
A golden age of planetary exploration was a realistic possibility, Science quoted Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, as saying in an interview. Dr. Fletcher believed space science was likely to be a major thrust of the space program in the 1980s, although NASA’s budget was vulnerable to cuts in the present political climate. He ruled out manned programs other than the space shuttle, but NASA would not become an all-purpose technology development agency for energy, ground transportation, and similar nonspace systems. Applications and materials processing would be important. Dr. Fletcher believed NASA’s program was acceptable to Congress and to the White House and that its future problem would not be wholesale cancellation of the space program but surviving annual budget cuts. Increased competition for money and staff attention in congressional space-related committees could aggravate NASA’s budgetary problems, according to Science. Observers had predicted that Congress would be faced with a choice between the shuttle and continuation of the space science and applications program. The decision could rest on the support of the shuttle program by organized labor, as it had in a 1972 Senate attempt to kill the shuttle. Some scientists had suggested that a $l-billion NASA budget cut would be better for science than a $100-million cut because the former would entail canceling the shuttle, in theory freeing money for space science. Dr. Fletcher had maintained, however, that a balance between programs would be kept. (Hammond, Science, 13 Dec 74, 1011-3) .
Kennedy Space Center had extended its contract with Chrysler Corp. Space Division for the period 1 Jan. 1974 through 31 July 1975, KSC announced. The $7 092 547 extension, which brought total value of the contract to $36 467 389, provided for prelaunch, launch, and postlaunch support of the Saturn IB 1st stage for a Skylab rescue vehicle, if required, and for the launch of an Apollo spacecraft in the 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, (ksc Release 17-74) During January: A 65% noise reduction during landing had been demonstrated by 38 United Air Lines, Inc., flight crews in an in-service evaluation of a NASA-developed landing technique under visual and instrument flight conditions, NASA announced. Using the NASA technique, a Boeing 727 aircraft approaching on a two-segment path exposed only a 50-sq-km area to greater than 90 effective perceived decibels of noise. The program was closely coordinated with the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Program guidance was provided by a Panel on Noise Abatement Flight Procedures with members from FA A, DOT, aircraft and avionics manufacturers, airlines, and pilots’ associations.

Manned space spectaculars were gone, at least until the 21st century, Thomas O’Toole said in the Washington Post. The similarities between the air age when men had begun flying and the space age were striking. Aviators had been considered stuntmen until they began to carry the mail. The Apollo flights, with their “vaguely circus air,” had struck many pepple the same way. The space shuttle promised to change all that. The U.S. planned to operate five shuttles, each one carrying more than 27 000 kg of satellites and space machinery into orbit 12 times a year, to “improve the quality of life on earth and to find out if life exists elsewhere in the solar system.” By the end of the 1980s the U.S. would have visited eight of the solar system’s nine planets; the only exception was Pluto. While one part of the space agency looked at the other planets, another would be looking down to learn more about the earth’s health. The next 20 yrs would see an unprecedented use of earth orbit to observe and communicate with the earth. O’Toole quoted Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, as saying that the earth orbit might become overcrowded. Not that things would bump into each other but “there will not be enough radio frequencies to communicate back to earth.” (W Post, 24 March 74, Cl)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, announced his decision to award Thiokol Corp. immediately a 5.5-million, 180-day letter contract to develop the space shuttle solid-fueled rocket motors. The definitive contract would be awarded later. Lockheed Propulsion Co. had protested to the General Accounting Office the original, 20 Nov. 1973 contract award to Thiokol. gao validated NASA’s selection procedures 24 June 1974. gao stated, however, that the NASA cost analysis had contained an overstatement of the cost differential favoring Thiokol’s proposal over Lockheed’s and recommended the NASA Administrator determine whether the award should be reconsidered. Dr. Fletcher advised the Comptroller General that the decision to proceed with Thiokol was based on the conclusion that the rationale used for the initial selection remained valid, (nasa Release 74-178; 74-180; A&A 1973)

The House passed, by a roll call vote of 407 to 7, H.R. 15572, the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development-Space-Science-Veterans FY 1975 appropriations bill. The bill—passed as recommended to the House by its Committee on Appropriations 21 June—appropriated $3,203 billion to NASA, $44.1 million below the FY 1975 budget request and $63.9 million below the FY 1975 authorization. Research and development funds totaled $2,327 billion, construction of facilities $135.67 million, and research and program management $740 million. An additional $4,435 million had been provided in the Special Energy Bill. The House cut $6.2 million authorized as planning funds for the Large Space Telescope, noting that the lst was not among the top four priority telescope projects selected by the National Academy of Sciences. Also the House deferred the $8.0 million requested to initiate seasat and recommended that the satellite be configured to fly on an early mission of the space shuttle. The Committee urged NASA to reprogram funds to begin work on erts-c as soon as possible but directed the agency not to reprogram any funds for cost overruns on the Viking project without requesting additional funds from Congress. Other cuts from the authorization included $15.8 million for the construction of facilities and $9.6 million for research and program management. (CR, 26 June 74, H5746-73; Com Rpt 93-1139)
The last of 130 new solid-state instrument landing systems were being delivered to Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration facilities worldwide.

Skylab . . . has demonstrated that this nation is capable of conducting broader and more useful beneficial activities in space that directly relate to our own planet Earth,” Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said at a postrecovery press briefing at Johnson Space Center. It had “moved the space program from the realm of the spectacular into a new phase that can be characterized ... as almost businesslike if not yet quite routine.” The Skylab experience was necessary for the future in space and had confirmed that NASA was proceeding in the right direction with development of the space shuttle. Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said 30 earth resources passes had been planned and 39 accomplished during the Skylab 4 mission. There had been 350 hrs of Apollo Telescope Mount observations planned and 338 hrs completed. Observations of Comet Kohoutek included 13 by the Apollo Telescope Mount and 111 by other instruments. All 28 planned corollary experiments and all major medical and student experiments had been completed. Original planning had called for 140 days in orbit for the three manned missions; 172 were accomplished. Skylab’s greatest achievement “was to prove . . . there is no limit in our space research”; the limit “is only our resolve, not our ability to do work, not the ability of men to work and not our technical knowledge.” (Transcript)
A Turkish Airlines, Inc., DC—10 jumbo jet airliner carrying 335 passengers and 11 crew members crashed in the Forest of Ermenonville 42 km northeast of Paris, France, killing all aboard in the worst air disaster in history. The crash—the second by a jumbo jet—occurred shortly after takeoff for London from the Paris Orly Airport. Aviation experts from the Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, manufacturer McDonnell Douglas Corp., ana Turkish government were sent to the scene to help French officials determine the cause. Eyewitness reports were conflicting but initial evidence pointed to a mid-air explosion; six bodies and one section of seats were found 10 km from the main point of impact. Later findings indicated that the rear cargo door had flown off. The sudden loss of pressure in the cargo hold had collapsed the cabin floor, severing the aircraft control cables, and sucked out the six passengers before the plane plunged steeply earthward.

Robert .Hotz, in an Aviation Week editorial, praised the “stabilizing and peace-keeping functions” of the large U.S. military space program. Scoring the “official government hypocrisy about our non-military space program,” Hotz argued the Eisenhower Administration’s attempt to separate civilian and military roles in space had “persisted to this day and badly impaired and obscured the truly peaceful role played by military space vehicles.” Air Force boosters and military-trained astronauts and managers had played key roles in NASA programs. Military reconnaissance satellites and early warning satellites added up to “one of the biggest forces in deterring major aggression and keeping as much peace as there is left in the world.” In contrast, claimed Hotz, the Soviet Union “never made any pretense of separating its military and scientific space activities” and had gone beyond reconnaissance satellites into “offensive space weapons.” (Av Wk, 7 Oct 74,11)
“I am sure life will move out from the Earth, probably first to the Moon and then to Mars,” Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator, said in a speech reviewing NASA’s planetary program before the National Space Club. Just what form of life would be transplanted, whether man or some simple organism, would be the subject of debate. Four planets—Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and Mercury—had already been visited. The next major event would be the Viking landings on Mars in 1976. Historically, two significant events in 1965 had determined the direction of the planetary program. The first was r. study at Woods Hole, Mass., which had recommended that the space program, following Apollo, should search for life on the planets and give first priority to the study of Mars—while also maintaining a wide-ranging program of general planetary exploration—because Mars most closely resembled the earth and was the most likely to support life. The second event, the 14 July 1965 flight of Mariner 4 past Mars, supported the recommendations when it found evidence of water in the Martian atmosphere. “In retrospect, I think the decision . . . has been sound.” But a major decision that faced NASA this summer, one year before the launch of Viking, was whether there should be follow-on Viking missions. “Should Mars continue to have first priority in planetary exploration? . . . Clearly, if we find evidence of life on Mars, . . . Mars will have first priority.” (Text)
Dr. John F. Victory, former Executive Secretary of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, died in Tucson, Ariz., at the age of 82. Dr. Victory, naca’s first employee when it was established in 1915, had been appointed Secretary of naca in 1921 and in 1948 had been named its Executive Secretary, responsible for naca’s functioning as an independent research agency. When NASA succeeded naca in 1958, he served as special assistant to Dr. T. Keith Glennan, NASA Administrator, and he remained with NASA until retirement in 1960. Dr. Victory, who had been known as “Mr. Aviation” in the industry, had received numerous awards, including a Presidential Medal for Merit, the first Air Foundation Certificate of Recognition, the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy, and naca’s Distinguished Service Medal.

Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.) praised the Skylab 4 astronauts (launched 16 Nov. 1973) on the eve of their splashdown after a record 84-day mission, concluding the Sylab program. On the floor of the precedented.” After damage to the Orbital Worshop during its 14 May House of Representatives Rep. Teague called the Skylab record “un-1973 launch, the three crews had repaired and altered the systems, exceeded their expected workloads, and returned vast amounts of useful information on earth rseources, solar phenomena, physical science, life sciences, and technology. The crews had spent 41 hrs in extravehicular activity and 171% days in earth orbit, demonstrating that man could live indefinitely and work productively in space. To date the U.S. manned space program had amassed 30 flights with some 21 850 hrs of active operation in space. “These programs— Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab—have made direct contributions to our daily lives as well as new scientific knowledge. . . . Skylab has amply demonstrated that space can be used for practical purposes.” (CR, 7 Feb 74, E533) _ _ _
Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., former NASA Deputy Administrator and Secretary of the Air Force, had been reelected to a four-year term as President of the National Academy of Engineering, nae announced. He was first elected to the office in May 1973 for a one-year term, (nae Release, 2 May 74) .
Hearings on S. 2658 and H.R. 11864, to enact the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974, were held by the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Rep. Mike McCormack (D—Wash.) said the legislation—which called for NASA, with other agencies, to develop and demonstrate solar technology—would set up a program that the National Science Foundation was not authorized to do and therefore would create no conflict with nsf’s ongoing research and development program in solar energy. Dr. H. Guyford Stever, nsf Director, said that the bill should be considered in the context of the “intensive and coordinated R&D effort” already under way in the Executive Branch. The NSF Act had authorized nsf as lead agency in basic and applied solar research and, with interagency cooperation, NSF could bring “practical solar energy systems into widespread use.” Dr. Stever expressed the Nixon Administration view that the Energy Research and Development Administration (erda), proposed in other legislation, would be the preferred agency to accelerate applied solar technology when programs reached the stage of large demonstration and development. However, if that legislation were not approved, the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development would be preferable over nasa as lead agency, because of hud’s experience with the local groups that would carry out the projects. Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, also expressed the Administration’s support of erda and of continuing NSF as the lead agency until ERDA was established. Dr. Fletcher suggested as an alternative plan, if erda were not established, that nasa serve as lead agency in phase one, the development of the technology and construction of solar units. Phase two, building the houses and installing the units, could be best handled by hud. There would be “no big problem” in transferring the responsibility to erda should it be established.

President Nixon sent a $304.4-billion FY 1975 U.S. budget request to Congress, an increase of $29.8 billion over FY 1974- With 90% of the increase mandatory under existing law, the budget included few new programs and few cuts. Federal funds for research and development would increase by 9% from FY 1974, to $19.8 billion total obligations, “reflecting recognition of the larger potential contribution of science and technology to the solution of critical national problems.” A substantial increase- was requested for energy r&d, $2.05 billion in FY 1975 from $942 million in FY 1974. The FY 1975 r&d request proposed investment in priority national needs, but included basic research as well as efforts to speed the use of federally sponsored r&d. The non-Federal investment in r&d was expected to be $16 billion, 45% of a national total of $36 billion. nasa’s total budget request of $3,247 billion was $245 million above the FY 1974 appropriation and $96.2 million above the 1974 budget plan. If approved, the increase would be NASA’s first since 1965, except for a $100-million FY 1973 increase that the agency had not been permitted to spend. Significant budget items are shown in the table. The Dept, of Defense FY 1975 budget request of $85.8 billion included $9.3 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation, an increase NASA FY 1975 Budget Highlights (in thousands; items do not add to program totals because only selected items are listed) Budget Item FY 1974 FY 1975 FY 1975 Authorization Request Difference Total budget authority $3 054 500 $3 247 129 +$192 629 (3 002 100 appropriation) (+245 029) Research and development 2 245 500 (2 194 000 2 346 015 +100 515 appropriation) (+152 015) Manned space flight 1 032 000 1 124 800 +92 800 Space shuttle 475 000 800 000 +325 000 Space flight operations 555 500 323 300 -232 200 Skylab 233 800 — -233 800 ASTP 90 000 114 600 +24 600 Development, test & operations 220 200 175 200 -45 800 Space life sciences 21 000 18 000 -3 000 Space sciences 552 000 547 015 -4 985 Physics & astronomy 63 600 140 515 +76 915 OSO (un- 7 630 OAO dis- 2 380 heao (suspended 1974) trib- 40 400 Orbiting Explorers uted) 33 000 Large Space Telescope — 6 200 +6 200 Lunar & planetary 311 000 266 000 -45 000 Viking (un* 89 016 Mariner Jupiter-Saturn 1977 dis* 69 761 Pioneer Venus (new start 1975) trib- 27 100 Helios uted) 1 400 Lunar sample analysis 5 798 Lunar science operations 4 333 Launch vehicle procurement 177 400 140 500 -36 900 Space applications $161 000 $177 500 +$16 500 Weather and climate 51 100 35 000 -16 100 Nimbus 5 & F fun- 7 000 Tiros-N dis- 9 000 SMS-A & -B trib- 1 400 GABP uted) 7 400 Pollution monitoring 13 900 29 800 +15 900 Earth resources'survey 49 600 58 600 +9 000 EHTS-B (on dis- 11 100 Aircraft survey tributed) 17 300 Earth and ocean physics 10 700 18 500 +7 800 SEASAT-A — . 8 000 +8 000 Space processing 3 100 3 500 +400 Energy applications 2 000 2 000 — Communications satellites 22 100 8 300 -13 800 Heat Capacity Mapping Mission — 2 600 +2 600 Aeronautics & space technology 252 000 241 200 -10 800 Aeronautical 180 000 166 400 -13 600 Space & nuclear 72 000 74 800 +2 800 Tracking & data acquisition 244 000 250 000 +6 000 Technology utilization 4 500 5 500 +1 000 Construction of facilities 112 000 151 490 +39 490 (101 100 (+50 390) Infrared telescope facility, Hawaii — 6 040 +6 040 X-ray telescope facility, msfc — 4 060 +4 060 Space shuttle facilities 67 200 86 020 +18 820 Research & program management 707 000 749 624 +42 624 (707 000 (+42 624) DOD FY 1975 KDT&E Budget Highlights (in thousands; items do not add to program totals because only selected items are listed) Budget Item FY 1974 Budget Plan FY 1975 Budget Plan FY 1975 Difference Research, development, test, & evaluation £8 333 009 £9 322 469 +3989 460 Military astronautics 593 926 527 248 -66 678 Aircraft 1 682 381 1 829 318 +146 937 B-l advanced strategic bomber 449 000 499 000 +50 000 A-10 close-air-support aircraft 107 000 268 000 +161 000 AF air combat ighter — 36 000 -36 000 usn vfx fighter prototype — 34 000 -34 000 Tanker/missile-carrier aircraft — 20 000 -20 000 Advanced medium stol transport (amst) 25 000 56 000 -31 000 F-14 interceptor aircraft 737 000 756 000 -19 000 F—15 air superiority fighter 1 129 000 1 076 000 -53 000 Missiles 2 124 762 2,352 993 +228 231 Trident missile 528 000 649 000 +121 000 Air-launched cruise missile 11 000 80 000 +69 000 Submarine-launched cruise missile 3 000 45 000 +42 000 Advanced icbm technology 4 000 37 000 +33 000 Minuteman-site-defense prototype development 110 000 160 000 +50 000 Terminally guided maneuvering reentry vehicle (marv) — 20 000 +20 000 of $989.5 million from the FY 1974 budget plan.

The U.S.S.R.’s Cosmonautics Day and 13th anniversary of the first manned space flight, made by Cosmonaut Yuri A. Gagarin in 1961, was marked by articles in the Soviet press. “Cosmonautics is one of the most important testing ranges of science in which many directions of science and technology are being synthesized into a single constantly perfecting system,” Soviet Academician Valentin Glushko wrote in Pravda. The successes of cosmonautics in the preceding 15 to 20 yrs had given a powerful impetus to various branches of knowledge. The initial accumulation of facts by spacecraft had been completed. On the agenda now was the detailed study of dynamic processes, the interconnection of phenomena, and the verification of hypotheses and models. Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training, acknowledged in an interview with Sovietskaya Rossiya the importance of orbital stations for future space experiments. He also acknowledged that Soviet designers had not yet been able to develop a satisfactory space shuttle. He said the U.S.S.R. had no plans for a manned landing on the moon. His impassioned defense of the Soviet space program suggested that it, like the U.S. program, was under fire by domestic critics; “many millions of rubles” had been saved because of the use of meteorological satellites. In Trud, Academician Boris N. Petrov, head of the Council of International Cooperation in Space Exploration and Use under the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that manned flights “must become more frequent and more extended” to produce “really creative work for specialists of many branches of science.” (Tass, fbis-Sov, 16 April 74, Ul-2; Wren, NYT, 13 April 74) to meet mission lifetime requirements—was met and the mission was adjudged successful 23 April. Westar 1 was acquired by a mobile ground station at 9:38 pm edt and control was turned over to Western Union. The satellite apogee motor was successfully fired at 5:21 pm edt 16 April and Westar 1 was placed in geosynchronous orbit with a 35 592-km apogee, 35 166-km perigee, 23-hr 35-min period, and 0.6° inclination. An onboard hydrazine reaction control system was moving the satellite toward its final position above the equator at 99° W longitude. Each of 12 transponders aboard Westar 1 could relay 1200 voice circuits, 1 color TV channel with program audio, or data at 50 megabits per sec. The Westar system-including one satellite to be launched in June, one satellite to be held in reserve, and five earth stations—would greatly increase Western Union’s capacity for commercial and personal communications. Expected to be operational in August, the system would be the first to interconnect, under one company, satellites and an existing continent-wide, computer-switched, multipurpose terrestrial network.

Japan successfully launched Tansei 2 experimental MS-T2 satellite from Kagoshima Space Center, Uchinoura, on a three-stage MU—3C booster at 2:00 pm local time (1:00 am edt) after a two-day postponement because of bad weather. A thrust-vector-control system had been installed on the 2nd stage of the booster to stabilize its flight. The improved version of the four-stage MU-4S was the first guided booster Japan had used. The satellite entered orbit with a 3229-km apogee, 283-km perigee, 121.7-min period, and 31.2° inclination, kyodo news service reported the objective was “to test the control devices and not for scientific observation.” Tansei 2, named “Light Blue” for the Univ. of Tokyo colors, was Japan’s fifth satellite and third test satellite. Ohsumi (launched 11 Feb. 1970) and Tansei 1 (launched 16 Feb. 1971) were test satellites returning performance data. Shinsei (launched 28 Sept. 1971) had carried instruments to study cosmic rays and electric waves, and Denpa (Radio Explorer Satellite launched 19 Aug. 1972) had carried instruments to probe the ionosphere, (gsfc SSR, 28 Feb 74; FBis-Japan, 22 Feb 74, 13-14; A&A 1971) The Italian-built 170-kg San Marco 4 carried three experiments: an Italian density-drag accelerometer to measure atmospheric drag, a U.S. omegatyon to measure the temperature and density of thermosphere molecular nitrogen, and a U.S. neutral mass spectrometer to measure primary constituents of the neutral atmosphere. Data gathered by San Marco 4 in the equatorial zone and Explorer 51 in the auroral zone would provide a good picture of the effects of magnetic storms on the thermosphere and differences in the thermosphere’s response to energy coming from the sun to the poles and the equator. The omegatron experiment was activated 19 Feb. and the neutral mass spectrometer 22 Feb. By 26 Feb. both instruments were acquiring worthwhile scientific data. The Italian density-drag accelerometer, activated shortly after launch but not performing properly, was being investigated. All spacecraft systems were functioning as planned. San Marco 4 was the fourth satellite launched under cooperative agreements between NASA and the Italian Space Commission. San Marco 1 was launched 15 Dec. 1964; San Marco 2, 26 April 1967; and San Marco 3, 24 April 1971. Under the latest agreement, signed 6 Aug. 1973, Italy had designed and built the spacecraft, provided one experiment, and conducted launch operations. The U.S. provided the Scout booster, two experiments, technical consultation, launch crew training, and spacecraft tracking and data acquisition, (nasa mors, 15, 26 Feb 74; NASA Releases 74-30,74-39) 18 February—6 March: Thomas L. Gatch ’was lost at sea while attempting the first transatlantic balloon flight. Gatch lifted off from Harrisburg, Pa., 18 Feb. in a two-meter sealed gondola, the Light Heart, suspended from 10 helium-filled balloons. He hoped to reach 12 000-m altitude and ride the jet-stream winds across the Atlantic to Europe, but changes in air currents pushed him south of his planned course. Radio contact was made with Gatch 19 Feb. by an airliner 1600 km east northeast of Puerto Rico. He was spotted at 305-m altitude 21 Feb. by a Liberian ship 1670 km off the coast of Africa. Further inconsistent and unconfirmed radio contacts and sightings made tracking Gatch’s balloon difficult. After reports of a sighting on the Spanish Sahara, the Spanish Foreign Legion searched the 480-km Moroccan-Spanish Sahara border for two days, while U.S. military aircraft and ships were put on lookout. The Dept, of Defense ordered an intensive visual radar and radio search 1 March of the Atlantic Ocean 1530 km west of Africa, but the search was given up 6 March after exploration of 578 000 sq km of ocean.

Federal research and development support of space programs had declined steadily in proportion to civil projects from 1969 to 1975, the National Science Foundation reported in its Analysis of Federal R&D Funding by Function, Fiscal Years 1969—1975. Energy and environment programs had outpaced other major civil programs, while space programs had been reduced more than any other R&D function in the period. In FY 1975, the space budget was 13% of the planned $19.6-billion Federal r&d funding, a decline from 23.9% in 1969. Manned space flight, including the space shuttle, would account for more than half the 1975 total, (nsf Report 74-313)
NASA’s shrinking work force and the relatively few available women and minority engineers and scientists were responsible for the agency’s admittedly poor record on equal employment, Dr. Dudley G. McConnell, NASA Assistant Administrator for Equal Opportunity Programs, told the Senate Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Development, Space, Science, and Veterans. The hearing was investigating the October 1973 dismissal of a NASA official, Mrs. Ruth Bates Harris, after she and two coauthors asserted in a report that the agency was not moving fast enough to hire women and minority workers and that NASA’s proportion of minority employees was the lowest in the Government. Despite the difficulties, NASA in the past had hired well above the agency’s current percentage of minorities: 10.3% in 1971; 13.2% in 1972; and 16.3% in 1973. Associate Deputy Administrator Willis H. Shapley denied the report was the reason for the Harris termination but conceded NASA’s poor record on minority hiring. Subcommittee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis.) ordered the agency to report to him quarterly on progress toward its own equal opportunity goals. (Transcript)
The first system to use solar energy to heat a U.S. school began operation in Timonium, Md. The $568 000 project, jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and AAl Corp. [see 2 Feb.], was rushed into operation in six weeks to use the remainder of the winter’s chilly days to gather experimental data for future solar heating systems. (Richards, W Post, 8 March 74, C2) 7, 12-14 March: Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space Science, testified on NASA’s space science program before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications during FY 1975 authorization hearings: A Solar Maximum Mission (smm) satellite was proposed for FY 1975 design study and launch in the next period of maximum solar activity, 19781979. smm would investigate solar flares and related phenomena and their effects on the solar-terrestrial system, making, for the first time, simultaneous measurements of flares across the electromagnetic spectrum—within a national program of satellite, sounding rocket, and ground-based observations of the sun during maximum activity. The spacecraft would be shuttle-retrievable for refurbishment and reflight with advanced solar physics experiments in the 1980s. Requested funding for the Large Space Telescope (Ls’r) for FY 1975 was $6.2 million, to proceed with design of telescope optics, detectors, and support systems. NASA had originally planned to spend about $10 million in FY 1975 on the lst—to be launched on the space shuttle in 1980—but reduced the request to reflect the four- to six-month delay in shuttle development. NASA—in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory, Sandia Laboratories, and West Germany—was developing an Aries sounding rocket to support the physics and astronomy program. Aries, which used the 2nd stage of surplus Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles, would provide a greater lift and longer flight time than possible at the price of rockets now in use. Cost overruns on the 1975 two-spacecraft Viking mission to Mars could total 10% of the original $838-million estimate for the program because of hardware development problems. Major problems with the biology instrument included packing the sophisticated instruments into a small volume, development of very small valves to inject sufficiently small amounts of nutrients into Martian samples, and thermal control. The instrument was running $21.2 million over the budgeted cost. Difficulties also had been encountered in producing enough 0.005-cm plated magnetic wire of uniform characteristics for the onboard computer. Dr. Naugle said that, although the overall coniplexity of the spacecraft had been underestimated, “we expect these problems to be solved and to launch both Viking spacecraft on schedule in 1975.” (Transcript) Experiments were designed to demonstrate an attitude control accuracy of better than three arc minutes using a gas jet system, measure the performance in orbit of operational infrared sensor components, demonstrate an inexpensive Canopus sensor of high reliability, measure the density of sun-reflecting particles near the spacecraft, determine interference generated by the propane gas control system, demonstrate a basic sensing element with application in digital sun and earth albedo sensors, and measure degradation of silicone solar cells in orbit. NASA’s objective of placing the satellite in an earth orbit that would permit achievement of the scientific objectives was met, and the mission was adjudged a success 19 March. Under a December 1972 Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the U.K.’s Dept, of Trade and Industry, NASA would be reimbursed for launch vehicle and services. Developed for the U.K. by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Ltd., the 83.5-by 66.5-cm, 92-kg spacecraft was powered by a four-panel 250-cm-long solar array of 1800 solar cells. Miranda was deployed in a fully sunlit polar orbit with a yo-yo despin system and its attitude control system acquired the sun through three sun sensors. The eighth NASA launch of a U.K. satellite and the fourth on a Scout vehicle—Miranda carried the names of 80000 Boy Scouts from nine U.S. states on a microdot.

Nixon praised the efforts of the “great American scientific, mechanical, and clerical communities” for their contributions to the space program. “You have contributed to . . . the spirit of a great country, which means always look out toward the unknown, go there, take any risk, make any sacrifice, and never be discouraged because sometimes you may fail.” Of the astp, President Nixon said that although systems of government were different, the U.S. wanted “to cooperate with the Russian people and with all the people on the earth in anything that will advance the cause of science, the cause of health, the cause of a better life foT all our children, as well, of course, as the cause of peace.” (jsc Roundup, 29 March 74,1; PD, 25 March 74,345-347)
The European Space Research Organization marked the 10th anniversary of the convention which established esro. The organization—which included member countries Belgium, Denmark, West Germany, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom—had successfully launched 7 satellites and 180 sounding rockets. In the 10 yrs of esro’s'existence, the budget had increased from $101.4 million for 1964-1966 to $405.6 million for 1972-1974. Employment had risen from 450 in 1964 to 1200 in 1974. The anniversary would be the last for esro, which was to he incorporated within the new European Space Organization. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, wrote Dr. Alexander Hocker, esro Director General: “We on the ‘working level’ of NASA who are now working very closely with this organization add our congratulations to those officially transmitted and look forward with pleasure to the continued association in bringing Spacelah into being.” (esro newsletter, 74-3; esro Release).
Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, signed a NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences agreement on news coverage of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight, scheduled for July 1975. The agreement brought a protest from Associated Press President and General Manager J. Wes Gallagher because it excluded American newsmen from the Soviet launching. In a 23 Oct. letter to Gallagher, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, stated that, while the Soviets were adamant on this question, they had otherwise agreed to provide “the most complete, Comprehensive release ever to the U.S. news media of real-time information related to a Soviet space mission.” The agreement, Dr. Fletcher noted, covered joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. activities while recognizing the right of each nation to establish policies for their respective independent activities. The U.S. would not exclude Soviet newsmen from the U.S. liftoff. The Public Affairs Agreement provided that, beginning with the Soyuz launch and ending with the Apollo recovery, onboard information from both spacecraft, voice communications between the spacecraft, and ground communications with both spacecraft, as well as ground-based and onboard TV, would be exchanged immediately. The first real-time TV coverage of a Soviet launch would be released to the West. Factual information on joint activities would be released immediately. Lines from the U.S. public affairs center in Moscow would communicate with technical specialists in the Soviet mission control center. For the first time, Soviet commentators would be at the Soviet control center and launch site during mission operations to describe countdown, launch, and mission events as they occurred, for immediate release, (nasa Int Aff, interview, 30 Sept 75; AP, NYT, 12 Oct 74, 2; 24 Oct 74, 9; NASA press conf transcript, 12 Nov 74)
In a Skylab awards ceremony at Marshall Space Flight Center, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented Group Achievement Awards to the Skylab Program Offices at msFc, Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center, and NASA Hq. and to special Skylab teams. Dr. Robert A. Parker, NASA astronaut and Skylab program scientist at JSC, received an Outstanding Leadership Medal. Dr. Fletcher also presented 28 individual Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medals to principal investigators for Skylab experiments and to Comet Kohoutek scientific investigators, (msfc Release 74-227; Marshall Star, 27 Nov 74) Questioned about a newspaper article saying the Viking lander might sink deep into Martian surface dust, Dr. Petrone said that tests mentioned in the article had been made some years earlier, not “two weeks ago” as reported. Dr. Noel W. Hinners, Associate Administrator for Space Science, testified that the lander’s footpad area had been increased since the earlier tests and that radar observations had indicated the proposed landing sites for the first mission appeared “well within the capability” of the lander. Sites for the second mission were still being studied.

The satellite was launched on a three-stage Thor-Delta launch vehicle from Eastern Test Range at 7:28 pm est into an orbit with a 36 965-km apogee, 185km perigee, and 24.6° inclination. The apogee kick motor, fired at 8:10 pm est on 24 Nov., circularized the orbit with an apogee of 36 595 km, perigee of 35 896 km, period of 24 hrs 19.4 min, and inclination of 2.2°. The spacecraft then drifted to its geosynchronous station at 50° E longitude over the Indian Ocean. NASA adjudged the launch a success 6 Jan. 1975. The first-generation Skynet A and B had been developed for the U.K. in the usaf’s Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program (idcsp) and launched by NASA 21 Nov. 1969 and 18 Aug. 1970. Skynet IIA failed to achieve a satisfactory orbit when launched 18 Jan. 1974 and reentered 25 Jan. The launch of Skynet I IB had been delayed from 19 Nov. by a defective component in the Delta 2nd-stage attitude control system.

Glynn S. Lunney, Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager, received the Arthur S. Flemming Award—given each year to 10 outstanding young Federal employees by the Washington, D.C., Jaycees—during a ceremony in Washington. Lunney’s selection was based on his work as U.S. Technical Director of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. The award cited his leadership and technical ability as important elements in the cooperation and progress achieved in the project by the two participating countries, (jsc Release 74-110; JSC Roundup, 21 June 74, 1) observatories, rockets, and aircraft. Dr. Charles R. O’Dell, project scientist for NASA’s Large Space Telescope program, said Kohoutek had been a landmark in the study of the solar system. “We found large numbers of heavy molecules that we had never seen before. We always thought they were there but now we have proof of it.” (nasa Release 74-109; Michelini, Birmingham Post-Herald, 14 June 74)
Major reorganizations were announced at NASA Hq. and Marshall Space Flight Center by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, msfc Director. Dr. Fletcher said the Headquarters reorganization and key personnel appointments would consolidate planning and direction of research and development programs under the Associate Administrator and overall planning and direction of the field center operations under the newly created position of Associate Administrator for Center Operations. Dr. Petrone was named Associate Administrator. He would remain as msfc Director until early summer when he would be replaced by Dr. William R. Lucas, msfc Deputy Director. Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space Science, was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator. He would also continue as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Science until a successor was named. Dr. George M. Low, in addition to his duties as Deputy Administrator, would serve as Acting Associate Administrator for Center Operations until the new position was filled. He would be assisted by Edwin C. Kilgore, Deputy Associate Administrator for Management in the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology. Gen. Bruce K. Holloway (usaf, Ret.), who would also continue as the Assistant Administrator for Dept, of Defense and Interagency Affairs, was named Acting Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology. Bernard Moritz was appointed Associate Administrator for Organization and Management. The reorganization, effective 15 March, followed completion of the Apollo and Skylab programs and would provide mechanisms for the phaseover from conventional launch vehicles to the space shuttle and new programs, Dr. Fletcher said. At msfc, Dr. Petrone said that the reorganization, effective 30 May, would enable the Center to fulfill requirements of its varied assigned programs and improve its competitive position to obtain new assignments. The major changes were in the Science and Engineering Directorate. A Deputy for Operations and a Deputy for Systems had been established. Business operations and control of all resources had been consolidated into a centralized office at the directorate level. Elements under the s&E Directorate included two associate directors, an Associate Director of Engineering and an Associate Director of Management; two offices, Reliability and Quality Assurance and Research and Technology; and eight laboratories. The laboratories were being restructured to emphasize system engineering and integration, analysis, design, and testing. The in-house capability to manufacture, inspect, and check out major hardware projects had been eliminated, with the associated supply, warehousing, and procurement capability. Reorganization in msfc’s Administration and Program Support Directorate included consolidation of Center-wide automatic data-process-ing functions within A&PS. Offices under a&PS would include Technology Utilization, Manpower, Financial Management, Facilities, Procurement, Management, Services, Logistics, and Computer Services.

Maj. Alexander P. de Seversky (U.S. Army Air Corps), aviation pioneer, died of a respiratory ailment in New York at the age of 80. Maj. de Seversky had begun his career as a pilot in the Czarist air force in Russia during World War I. After coming to the U.S. in 1918 he contributed to military and commercial aviation, helping to develop the first fully automatic synchronous bombsight, gyroscopically stabilized flight instruments, inflight fueling techniques, and a variety of landing gear for seaplanes and aircraft. He also led the effort to design, huild, and test an all-metal fighter aircraft, the P—35, the first aircraft to fly faster than 480 km per hr. In 1931 he founded the Seversky Aircraft Corp., the forerunner of Republic Aircraft Corp. During World War II de Seversky became one of the country’s leading advocates of strategic air power, saying that the U.S. could not win a “limited war fought with traditional forces.” He argued that “the whole military philosophy must be changed or we shall forever trail the rest of the world not only in conventional aircraft, but in intercontinental ballistic missiles and even in man-made earth satellite development.” (Fraser, NYT, 26 Aug 74, 32; AP, Orlando, Florida, Sentinal Star, 26 Aug 74, B4) Tass reported 28 Aug. that on the second working day the cosmonauts felt well and had made “experiments to perfect the technique of piloting the ship in different flight regimes.” During maneuvering Soyuz 15 approached the Salyut 3 space station many times, the cosmonauts controlling spaceship functions, observing the approach, and inspecting the station. Tass then reported the crew was “concluding the flight and . . . preparing the spacecraft for the return to the earth.” After a 48-hr 12-min mission, Soyuz 15 sofflanded safely at 1:10 am 29 Aug. Baykonur time (4:10 pm edt 28 Aug.)—the first Soviet night landing—48 km southwest of Tselinograd in Kazakhstan despite a “difficult meteorological situation.” On-the-spot medical examinations showed the cosmonauts to be in “good health.” Early press reports quoted Western experts as saying the flight probably ended early because of a failure in the docking mechanism of the spacecraft, damage to or failure of the spacecraft during the attempted linkup, or a serious deterioration of the Salyut orbital station. In'response to questions about the impact of the Soyuz 15 mission on the planned July 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz mission, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said in a 29 Aug. statement, “nasa personnel engaged in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. . . were informed in advance by Soviet personnel of the ‘Soyuz 15’ flight and its approximate timing.” Dr. Fletcher said that neither Soyuz 14 (launched 3 July) nor Soyuz 15 “carried the astp docking mechanism. We have no reason to douht this information.” At a 9 Sept, press briefing at Johnson Space Center, Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, Soviet chief of cosmonaut training, confirmed through his translator that a hard dock had been one objective of the Soyuz 15 mission and that there were problems with the docking system. “In our previous flights ... we had worked out the automatic rendezvous and docking, but it worked only up to 150 meters. . . . From that point, it was purely manual.” At an 11 Sept, jsc press briefing, Shatalov said that during the Soyy,x 15 flight the automatic system “worked well” up to 30 to 50 m. “But when going beyond 50-40, the range rate exceeded the necessary or the intended parameters.” He also said the approaches had been repeated “a number of times and each time the automatic system worked up to 30-40 meters. ... At no time in these approaches was it intended to use manual docking.” He emphasized that they were satisfied with the automatic system to the point it had worked. He also said the second major objective of the mission was “to perfect this night landing.” Soyuz 15 was the second spacecraft to visit Salyut 3, the Soviet’s third orbiting station. A two-man crew, launched 3 July aboard Soyuz 14, had spent nearly 16 days aboard the station performing scientific experiments.

President Ford accepted a segment of crystal grown in the orbiting Skylab Workshop during January, from Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Chairman Howard W. Johnson. Johnson said the indium-antimonide crystal, produced in an MIT experiment, was the purest crystal with the longest life yet produced by man. Using it to carry power current, a computer could be the size of a postage stamp. (NASA Activities, 15 Nov 74, 17; PD, 11 Nov 74,1428; UPI, W Post, 5 Nov 74,1)
The appointment of Richard G. Smith as Deputy Director of Marshall Space Flight Center, effective 18 Nov., was announced by Center Director William R. Lucas. Smith would also continue as acting director of MSFc’s Science and Engineering Directorate. Since 1960, Smith had held positions of increasing responsibility in the Science and Engineering Directorate, including Saturn Program Manager from 1970 to 1973. (msfc Release 74-218)
Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider testified before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight in NASA’s FY 1975 authorization hearings on early results from Skylab’s earth resources data. Perhaps the most interesting so far was the unconfirmed indication of mineral deposits near Ely, Nev. The Skylab earth resources experiment package had also identified several areas of citrus fruit fly infestation on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, demonstrated the use of remote sensing for snow mapping, identified new urbanization patterns in Phoenix, Ariz., and inventoried vegetation patterns in California test sites. A Baltimore-Washington area photo and similar imagery for 12 other cities were being used by the Dept, of Interior to test their use for updating the 1970 census. Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, astronaut on the 25 May-22 June 1973 mission to man the Orbital Workshop, testified that Skylab astronauts were healthy, happy, and not under significant stress during their long flights. After initial decreased appetite, an astronaut had a feeling of well-being with normal thirst and appetite, although he had a continued feeling of fullness in the head and tended to assume a peculiar posture with neck extended and moving backwards and elbows, hips, and knees flexed at 20° to 30°. He tended to become sleepy and required frequent exercise to restore vigor and alertness. His voice had a peculiar nasal quality. After the third day he was virtually immune to motion sickness.. Without gravity, there was no automatic sensation of up and down and without vision he could quickly get lost. Dr. Harry C. Gatos, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist and Skylab materials processing investigator, testified Skylab experiments had shown that segments of crystals partially regrown in space exhibited none of the inhomogeneities from dopants (electronically active chemical elements) that characterized earth-grown crystals and inhibited their efficiency. In addition to preparation of special materials for electronic and medical uses, materials processing studies in space would provide an understanding of the structures of materials and permit preparation of materials to perform closer to their theoretical limits. Crystal-growing technology was developing new means to create and store power and could, within five years, provide a practical economic basis for using solar power. (Transcript)
A full-scale simulated crash of an aircraft with a crew of four lifelike dummies was successfully completed at Langley Research Center as part of five years of tests in a program to study the crash-worthiness of light, general-aviation aircraft. The aircraft, a surplus twin-engine Piper Navajo, was suspended from the top of the test facility and swung by cables into the ground at 97 km per hr. An umbilical cable fed data on structural response back to a computer. The program was a cooperative effort with the Federal Aviation Administration and private industry to develop structural design techniques to improve the capability of light aircraft to withstand crash conditions and to increase the likelihood of passenger survival, (nasa Release 74—107; Newport News, Va., Times Herald, 9 May 74)
Air traffic activity during 1973 had increased 6% over 1972 activity at Federal Aviation Administration airport control towers, air route traffic control centers, and flight service stations, the FAA reported. The increase was the largest recorded by towers since 1968 and followed three years of declining activity. Takeoffs and landings at the 386 FAA-operated control towers during 1973 totaled 56 533 953, up from 53 255 919 in 1972. (faa Release 74-86)
Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center since its establishment in 1962, announced his retirement. Born in Germany, Dr. Debus had begun his career in U.S. military and NASA space programs in 1945, when with Dr. Wernher von Braun he had joined the Army’s ballistic missile program. He had supervised the launch of the first Redstone ballistic missile in 1953 and the flight-testing of Jupiter and Pershing missiles and Jupiter C and Juno launch vehicles until the Army team was transferred to NASA in 1960. He had directed the launch of the first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, on 31 Jan. 1958, and NASA launch programs from the flight of Alan B. Shepard, Jr., in 1961 to preparations for space shuttle operations. Dr. Debus had received the Louis W. Hill Space Transportation Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics as well as the Army’s highest civilian decoration, the Exceptional Civilian Service Medal, and NASA’s Distinguished Service Medal.

A General Accounting Office report disclosed by Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton (D-Mo.) had questioned Pentagon plans to begin production of 34 radar-carrying aircraft, part of the Airborne Warning and Control System, the Washington Post reported. The GAO report said the radar planes’ mission, defense against bomber attack, had changed and the project should be delayed until it was certain the system would work in its new role. There had been no demonstration that the aircraft could work effectively in a massive air battle. In addition, GAO questioned whether the aircraft’s large radar would be susceptible to enemy jamming from distances as great as 320 km and whether the planes would become high-priority targets. Sen. Eagleton therefore had requested the Senate Armed Services Committee to deny aw ACS production in 1974. (Getler, W Post, 11 March 74, A2) 11, 21 March: Joint hearings on the Technology Resources Survey and Applications Act, S. 2495, were held by the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and the Committee on Commerce. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said NASA supported the broad objectives of the bill, which would amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to establish within NASA an Office of Technology Applications to support the proposed National Resources Council. However, NASA already had an effective technology utilization program and did not require additional authority to ensure that its technological capabilities were effectively used. Dr. Fletcher said he could give more support to the bill if the responsibility for a proposed survey of technological resources were given to the existing Domestic Council. Dr. H. Guyford Stever, National Science Foundation Director, said technology coordination and planning analysis could be more effectively done by an augmented Federal Council for Science and Technology than by the proposed Council. In addition, although NASA had great technological resources, it was essential that mission agencies should be held to their originally defined responsibility. Dr. Philip Handler, President of the National Academy of Sciences, said the bill unduly emphasized technological resources of NASA and the aerospace industry, when the real issue was how to use the entire Federal science and technology effort in combination with private industry resources within coherent national programs and plans. Instead of direct authorization to NASA, a similar amount should be made available to the President or a council, such as the Council of Economic Advisors or the Council on Environmental Quality, to allocate and coordinate. Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., President of the National Academy of Engineering and former NASA Deputy Administrator, favored a compact organizational structure with leadership appointed by the President and a research staff independent of all agencies and industry. NASA-developed technology could be used with that in other agencies and private industry. NASA laboratories should be used whenever appropriate. Employees and facilities of Lewis Research Center, which was preeminent in the fields of air-breathing and space-propulsion systems, could be applied effectively to energy research and development.

Johnson Space Center had issued requests to 11 interested aerospace companies to submit contract proposals for computing and data processing for space program software systems, JSC announced. Primary objective of the contract would be to define, design, .develop, and maintain software systems (for space shuttle, earth resources, and other science programs) that had maximum flexibility for supporting a wide variety of missions and future requirements. The cost-plus-award-fee contract would run from 1 July 1974 through 31 Dec. 1979. (JSC Release 74-30)
A breathing system developed by Johnson Space Center using technology for solid-propellant rocket-motor cases was being evaluated in the field by Houston firemen. New air tanks were built of spiral-wound glass fiber over an aluminum liner to provide a lighter and more durable system. (NASA Release 74-320) 10 December-16 January 1975: nasa launched West German-built Helios 1 solar probe at 2:11 am Est from Eastern Test Range on a Titan IIIE— Centaur vehicle, putting it on a path that would take it closer to the sun than any spacecraft had yet traveled. The spacecraft first entered a parking orbit and then an elliptical orbit of the sun with a 0.985-au aphelion, 0.3095-au perihelion, 190.15-day period, and 0.02° inclination to the ecliptic. All vehicle systems performed normally during launch. The Titan-Centaur carried a Delta solid-fueled rocket-motor kick stage as a 4th stage and required seven interdependent ignition systems. Following separation from the 1st stage, the Centaur, with 2300 kg of propellants remaining, began maneuvers to provide data for the 1977 Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, future synchronous orbit missions, and continued development of the launch vehicle. Maneuvers included a one-hour coast and restart, three-hour coast with thermal maneuvers, boost-pump operation experiment with igniter on, and zero-g boost-pump dead-head operation. Helios 1 was to investigate the fundamental solar processes and solar-terresfrial relations by studying the solar wind, magnetic and electric fields, cosmic rays, and cosmic dust from launch to the first perihelion, 0.31 au from the sun. The 370-kg spool-shaped spacecraft carried 10 instruments—7 West German and 3 U.S.—to measure the solar wind, magnetic field, and related shock waves; study radio waves and oscillations in the electron plasma; measure the spatial gradient of solar and galactic cosmic rays; observe composition and dynamics of interplanetary dust; and monitor x-ray activity of the solar disc. By 16 Jan. orientation and spin-rate maneuvers had been conducted and the high-gain antenna despun and pointed toward the earth. Control of the spacecraft had been passed to Germany. Instruments had been turned on and were operating normally with two exceptions: One of two antennas in the U.S. plasma-wave experiment had jammed during extension and unrolled inside the drive enclosure, producing an electrical ground and degrading all low-frequency data. Rewinding the antenna had not eliminated the ground. In addition, operation of the high-gain antenna for the West German plasma experiment produced a space . charge near the spacecraft, preventing detection of electrons with energies less than 100 ev. The medium-gain antenna would be used during selected periods. To prepare for its demanding mission, Helios 1, designed to withstand the highest temperatures ever demanded of a spacecraft, had been successfully subjected to six days at 644 K (700°F), the highest heat load expected at 0.3 au, during spring 1974 tests at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spacecraft had also withstood radiation 11 times the solar intensity at the outer edge of the earth’s atmosphere. Independent payload components, louver systems, optical surface reflectors and mirrors, and several layers of insulation dissipated spacecraft heat. In addition the spacecraft spun at one revolution per second to distribute evenly the heat coming from the sun. Temperatures within the experiment area were kept between 263 and 303 K (14° and 86°F). A second Helios spacecraft would be launched in 12 to 18 mos and information from the two spacecraft would be received simultaneously from widely differing locations, for comparison with each other and with data from Pioneer- and iMP-class spacecraft. Helios, the third cooperative U.S. and West German project, was agreed,on during 1966 talks. Following technical discussions and mission definition, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed 10 June 1969. NASA provided three scientific instruments, spacecraft technical support, launch vehicle and operations, and initial tracking and data acquisition and flight operations. The German Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (bmft) designed, built, and tested the spacecraft and provided seven scientific instruments, data acquisition and analysis, and spacecraft control. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for NASA project management; Lewis Research Center had responsibility for the launch vehicle.

Project da Vinci—oft-delayed manned-atmospheric-research balloon flight—was terminated after one third of its projected 36-hr duration, because of threatening weather. The joint project of the Atomic Energy Commission, National Geographic Society, and the Army’s Atmospheric Sciences Laboratory was intended primarily to investigate atmospheric behavior at 1200-4300 m, where less scientific research had been done than at very high and very low altitudes. Floating free and staying with a single parcel of air as long as possible, the four crewmen studied atmospheric behavior over mountains, plains, forests, and cities. They had hoped to travel in their 21-m helium balloon from the launch site at Las Cruces, N. Mex., to a landing near Lubbock, Tex. The project safety officer terminated the flight over Wagon Mound, N. Mex., but not before enough data had been gathered to plan future flights.

The spacecraft then headed on toward a September 1979 encounter with Saturn. Pioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972, had been the first spacecraft to reach Jupiter—3 Nov. 1973—9 Jan. 1974. The success of that mission permitted NASA scientists to attempt a somewhat riskier approach with the backup Pioneer 11, a clockwise trajectory by the south polar region and then straight up through the intense inner radiation belt by the equator and back out over the north pole. Although the spacecraft went within 42 000 km of the planet at 12:22 am est 3 Dec., its peak speed of 171 000 km per hr and the trajectory’s high latitude prevented serious radiation damage. The Jupiter mission of Pioneer 11 was to map the magnetic field; measure distributions of high-energy electrons and protons in the radiation belts and look for auroras; find a basis for interpreting radio emissions from Jupiter; detect and measure the bow shock and magnetospheric boundary and their interactions with the solar wind; verify the thermal balance and determine temperature distribution of the outer atmosphere; measure the hydrogen-helium ratio in the atmosphere; measure the structure of the ionosphere and atmosphere; measure the brightness, color, and polarization of Jupiter’s reflected light; perform two-color visible-light imaging; and increase the accuracy of orbit predictions and masses of Jupiter and its moons. The interplanetary mission was to map the interplanetary magnetic field; study the radial gradient of the solar wind and its fluctuations and structure; study the radial and transverse gradients and arrival directions of high-energy charged particles (solar and galactic cosmic rays); investigate relationships between the solar wind, magnetic field, and cosmic rays; search for the boundary and extent of the heliosphere (solar atmosphere) ; determine the density of neutral hydrogen; and determine the properties of interplanetary dust. Hurtling toward and then away from Jupiter, Pioneer 11 sent data back to the earth at 2048 bits per sec throughout most of the month before and after encounter. Picture-taking of Jupiter began 18 Nov., at 14 800 000 km out from the planet. From 25 Nov. through 8 Dec., imaging and polarimetry observations were made 23 hrs a day. On 26 Nov. Pioneer 11 crossed the detached bow shock wave (7 772 000 km out) at the juncture of the solar wind and Jupiter’s magnetic field and entered the magnetosphere (6 923 000 km out). In five hours the spacecraft passed undamaged through this first field of intense radiation. On 1 Dec. it crossed the orbit of Callisto—outermost of the five inner moons—and began returning its best pictures of Jupiter. On 2 Dec. Pioneer 11 crossed the orbits of Jupiter’s four closest moons and entered the inner radiation belt. During this last leg of the approach to the south polar region, the spacecraft continued the imaging and sensing of the planet and moons and made a closeup, two-hour scan that included the red spot portion of the surface. Less than 12 hrs before the spacecraft passed behind Jupiter, an intense peak of electron radiation built up a 4000-v electric charge within the spacecraft. The charge created an electric arc that signaled heater lines to turn on—drawing spacecraft power and weakening the signal to earth. In about three hours the problem was identified and override commands from earth switched the beaters back off. At midnight on 3 Dec. Pioneer 11 entered Jupiter radio occultation— a blackout that lasted 42 min while the spacecraft swung behind the 142 744-km-dia planet—moving from the south pole straight up over the north pole. Since Pioneer 11 radio signals required 46 min to cross the 737 million km separating the earth and Jupiter at the time of encounter, the spacecraft had already circumscribed tbe planet before the earth lost contact with its signal. During occultation the spacecraft passed through the most intense radiation (up to 40 000 times as much in the earth’s radiation belts), reached its greatest speed (171 000 km per hr) and came closest to the planet (witbin 42 000 km of the cloudtops). At 1:24 am EST—62 min after periapsis—the signal reached earth, indicating that the spacecraft had emerged from behind the planet and that all systems had survived the most critical phase of the mission. Temporary failures had lost some data, but no permanent damage was sustained. Following the Jupiter encounter, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, renamed the spacecraft Pioneer-Saturn as it headed toward the planet Saturn. The exact target point had not been selected but scientists considered an interesting possibility was to target the spacecraft to pass between Saturn and its rings and then close by Titan, one of Saturn’s moons and a possible location of life. The five-year, 2.4-billion-km trip to Saturn would carry Pioneer-Saturn about 160 000 000 km above the orbit planes of most planets. Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to use the gravity of an outer planet to throw it to another planet farther out, came the closest to Jupiter, was the fastest spacecraft yet launched, and was the first spacecraft to photograph Jupiter’s polar regions. Pioneer-Saturn was expected to become the first spacecraft to pass far from the ecliptic plane and the first to reach Saturn. Pioneer 11 confirmed, but somewhat modified, the findings of Pioneer 10. The model of a relatively flat, disclike magnetosphere was challenged by new evidence suggesting a large, blunt magnetosphere of irregular and fluctuating shape. Temperature measurements of about 125 K at cloud-tops supported Pioneer 10 readings, which were lower than those indicated by earth-based observations. Imaging revealed a decrease in the banding structure of the planet with increased latitude and a more mottled structure across the poles, (nasa Releases 74-292, 74-300; Hall, Opp, et al., Science, 2 May 75, 445-77; NASA Pioneer Mgr, interview, 12 Nov 75; NASA press conference transcript, 19 Nov 74; Perlman, SF Chron, 3 Dec 74; O’Toole, W Post, 3 Dec 74, Al; Sullivan, NYT, 4 Dec 74, 27; Mead, San Jose Mercury, 5 Dec 74; NYT, 9 Dec 74)
The Aerospace Industries Assn, of America, Inc., predicted “a slight decline” in sales in 1974 after a jump of more than 10% in 1973, the New York Times reported. Industry sales were expected to total $24.7 billion in 1974, 1% lower than the 1973 boom that had pulled the industry out of a five-year slump. Aia President Karl G. Harr, Jr,, had said, however, that the energy crisis could bring a greater decline. Fuel shortages already had softened markets for commercial aircraft, and jet transport orders could taper off, although the Department of Defense was beginning a new generation of tactical and strategic weapons. Aerospace industry business with the space program was expected to continue its five-year decline, dropping by about 2.7% to sales of $2.3 billion in 1974. Profits of the industry had risen in 1973, to an average of 2.7% of sales after taxes, but employment dropped 1 % to 935 000 persons in 1973, and was expected to fall to 915 000 in 1974.

Japan and the People’s Republic of China signed a civil aviation agreement in Peking setting up commercial flights between the two countries. Japan Air Lines Co., Ltd., would be able to fly to Peking and Shanghai. Civil Aviation Administration of China flights to Tokyo would be the P.R.C.’s first service to a non-Communist country. The P.R.C. had purchased 10 Boeing 707s for its expanded international service, including possible future service to Canada, the U..S., and Latin America. In addition to ratification by Japan’s Diet, technical details would have to be worked out before regular service could begin. Within hours after the agreement was announced the Foreign Minister of the Republic of China (Nationalist) announced termination of service by jal and Taiwan’s China Air Lines between Taiwan and Japan and a ban on jal flights over Taiwan.

President Nixon wired congratulations to Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, on Mariner 10’s successful 5 Feb. flyby of the planet Mercury: “The successful flight . . . marks another historic milestone in America’s continuing exploration of the solar system. With this mission we will begin to end centuries of speculation abotxt our planetary neighbor closest to the Sun. On behalf of all Americans, I extend warmest congratulations to NASA and the Mariner 10 team on their outstanding performance. The hard work, skill, and ingenuity that contributed to the success of Mariner 10 is in keeping with that historical tradition which began when men landed at Plymouth Rock and has continued through the landing of men on the moon.” (PD, 1 April 74, 374)
Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., the first U.S. man in space and the fifth man to walk on the moon, announced his retirement from NASA and the Navy effective 1 Aug. During his 5 May 1961, 14.8-min Mercury -Redstone 2 mission, Shepard flew his Freedom. 7 spacecraft to a 186.2-km altitude and initiated the U.S. manned space program. He commanded the Apollo 14 lunar landing mission 31 Jan.—9 Feb. 1971. Shepard would join the Marathon Construction Co. of Houston, Tex., as a partner and Chairman, (nasa Release 74-203; A&A 1961)
Key appointments in the space shuttle program at Marshall Space Flight Center became effective. Robert E. Lindstrom became Manager of the Space Shuttle Office, replacing Roy E. Godfrey, who became Special Assistant to the msfc Director. Within the Shuttle Office, James R. Thompson became Project Manager for the space shuttle main engine. John A. Chambers became Deputy Manager of the Shuttle Engine Office and Frank M. Stewart became technical assistant to the Manager of the Shuttle Projects Office, (msfc Release 74-41)
The first few space shuttle flights would land at Flight Research Center, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, announced in a talk before the Antelope Valley Board of Trade, Lancaster, Calif. First horizontal test flights would be made from FRC and first orbital test flights would return there because of added safety margins and good weather conditions. FRC would also he a secondary landing site for operational shuttle flights when weather or other conditions made it desirable. (nasa Release 74-279)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released the budget statement he had given at a 2 Feb. press briefing. The FY 1975 NASA budget plan for new authorization of $3,247 billion and spending of $3,273 billion, although a “constrained budget,” would carry forward the programs planned in FY 1974. Goals and major programs were the same, with three new projects in space science and applications, but the space shuttle had been slipped four to six months. NASA’s FY 1974 budget had “reflected a sharp temporary reduction, because of Government-wide fiscal problems . . . , below the $3.4 billion level previously planned as the long-term level.” Increases in FY 1975 and later years were therefore “in order to approach again the level required to maintain . . . advances in space and aeronautics for the rest of the decade.” The FY 1975 increase of “about $100 million,” however, was less than required to return to NASA’s complete program as planned, and adjustments had been necessary. Principally, the first manned orbital flight of the shuttle was rescheduled to the second quarter of 1979, instead of the end of 1978, but NASA had a “firm commitment now” that there would be no more slips for budgetary reasons, and none was expected for technical reasons. NASA Comptroller William E. Lilly said at the briefing the stretchout was expected to increase shuttle costs about $50 million “in 1971 dollars.” The $800 million requested for the shuttle was $89 million less than NASA had submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. In the three new space flight projects, Pioneer Venus had top scientific priority as the next step in planetary exploration. Two missions launched in 1978 would study the Venus atmosphere for a better understanding of that planet and of the earth’s atmosphere, meteorology, and climatology. In the second new start, seasat, an experimental applications satellite, would measure ocean characteristics to aid scientific understanding of ocean dynamics and determine if a forecasting system could be developed, seasat-a was to be launched in 1978. The third start, the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (hcmm), would launch an Explorer satellite in 1977 to make thermal measurements of the earth’s surface to help find mineral resources and potential geothermal energy sources and to discriminate rock structures for planning civil works such as highways. NASA was asking $6 million to build the world’s first large infrared telescope, on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, for planetary research to complement planetary space flights, especially to provide data for the 1977 launch of the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probe. Another new thrust, still in the planning stage, was the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss) , to return the large amounts of data expected from the shuttle in the 1980s and permit phase-out of some tracking stations. NASA would not develop the spacecraft for the TDRSS but would lease satellite services from a private organization, beginning in CY1979. Analysis of data from the Skylab missions that were ending with the 8 Feb. splashdown of Skylab 4 would continue for many years. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project joint engineering and training activities with the U.S.S.R. were on schedule. All shuttle hardware prime contractors and most subcontractors had been selected, and the Dept, of Defense tentatively planned to modify an existing upper stage for use as an interim space tug with, the shuttle. Erts 1, launched 23 July 1972, was still working well, exceeding its design life by more than six months. ERTS-b, previously planned for 1976 launch, had been moved to 1975. A number of nasa and 11 commercial applications launches were scheduled during the year. A nominal communications satellite research program would be continued. In space astronomy, oso-i was scheduled for 1975 and the heAo series would be resumed, with launches planned for 1977, 1978, and 1979. Astronautics programs would continue to develop technology to improve fuel economy, reduce noise, and improve performance of U.S.-built civil transport aircraft. nasa’s Civil Service employment was to be stabilized at the end of FY 1974 levels except for a further reduction of 354 persons at Marshall Space Flight Center following completion of Skylab. NASA’s FY 1975 total would be 24 616, about 2200 less than in FY 1973 and 354 less than in FY 1974. Support service contractors at the Centers had reductions planned at about the same level, the 25 000 FY 1973 total dropping to 24 000 in FY 1974 and to 22 000 in FY 1975.

The House agreed to H. Res. 988, the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974, by a 359-to-7 vote, reorganizing House committee jurisdictions and procedures. The name of the Committee on Science and Astronautics was changed to Committee on Science and Technology effective 3 Jan. 1975, and the Committee’s jurisdiction was broadened to include all research and development in non-nuclear energy, environment, weather, and aviation, with special oversight over all nonmilitary Federal r&d. Legislative responsibility for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would be shared with the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Responsibility for Federal Aviation Administration civil aviation R&D programs would be added to that for NASA’s aeronautical R&D. Major emphasis on the civilian national space program would continue. (CR, 8 Oct 74, D1210-11, H10146-69; 17 Feb 75, 534-5; House Com Staff interview, 24 March 76)
An automated blood pressure monitoring system developed for the NASA integrated medical and behavioral laboratory measurement system (nyiBLMs) program was being evaluated for use in studies on control of high blood pressure, Johnson Space Center announced. Using Skylab technology, the system combined a blood pressure cuff with a pressure ramp programmer for continuous monitoring and a numerical display. Dr. Ted Andrechuk of Texas Tech Univ. was evaluating the system, which was providing hypertensive subjects with biosensory data for a biofeedback conditioning program. The conditioning would allow the patient to lower his blood pressure permanently, (jsc Release 74184) 6, 8, 9 August: The Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee conducted hearings on S. 2350 and S. 3484, bills to establish an Office of Earth Resources Survey Systems within NASA and an Earth Resources Observation Administration within the Dept, of the Interior. Both proposals were designed to move the Earth Resources Technology Satellite system from an experimental to an operational phase. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, opposed the organizational changes proposed by the bills. He argued that S. 2350 would erect barriers in NASA between the erts system and related programs in NASA’s Office of Applications; keeping these programs together would facilitate hardware development and data reduction and handling. S. 3484 would limit NASA’s research and development in earth resources to activities supported and funded by the Dept, of the Interior. Citing the need for more spectral channels, more rapid handling of data, and more frequent repetitive coverage with ERTS-class satellites, Dr. Fletcher stated that there was no clear-cut distinction between experimental and operational phases in the earth resources program. What was needed was “a continuous evolutionary approach, in which operationally useful data from space are provided to users for research, for experimental demonstrations, and for routine operations when they are ready, while at the same time and with the same satellites necessary improvements to the system can be developed and used.” Proponents of the bills argued that erts data would be exploited fully only when users could be guaranteed the continuously available data offered by an operational system. Hearings would be continued 18 Sept. (Transcript)
Marshall Space Flight Center held a final review of the Zero-Gravity Atmospheric Cloud Physics Project Phase A Definition Study. The study established the feasibility of atmospheric cloud physics research on Spacelab and recommended preparation of a Phase B study, (msfc Orbital & Space Environmental Br, interview, 6 Aug 75; msfc Release 74-181) 9— 25 October: Johnson Space Center Flight Operations Aircraft Div. completed the first mission of Project Airstream, gathering high-altitude gaseous and particulate samples from the upper atmosphere in the Western Hemisphere with the NASA high-altitude WB-57F aircraft. Sampling missions, flown for the Atomic Energy Commission and the Dept, of Transportation, allowed AEC to determine the global distribution of atmospheric nuclear weapon test debris, both gaseous and particulate. Nine NASA crewmen alternated in the 14 flights of the first mission, logging 51 500 km in all. (JSC Release 74-269) 10— 30 October: NASA launched Westar 2 (Westar-B), the second U.S. commercial domestic communications satellite, for Western Union Telegraph Co. from Eastern Test Range at 6:53 pm edt on a Thor-Delta launch vehicle. The satellite was placed in a close-to-planned transfer orbit with a 36 107-km apogee, 231-km perigee, and 24.76° inclination. The apogee kick motor, fired 13 Oct., circularized the orbit with 35 766km apogee, 35 244-km perigee, 23-hr 42-min period, and 0.5° inclination. By 25 Nov. the comsat was operating normally at its station at about 90° W longitude above the equator. The launch had been twice delayed, once for investigation of the entire Delta program and once for a last minute check of a connector pin. When launched, the vehicle performed as planned with two minor exceptions (both due to human error): the 2nd-stage cold-gas redundant altitude-control system switched from primary to backup nozzles because the guidance system had been programmed with too low a moment threshold and the umbilical end fitting was damaged because a tether had been improperly installed. Neither problem compromised the NASA mission objective: to place the satellite in an orbit of sufficient accuracy for transfer into a stationary synchronous orbit while retaining sufficient stationkeeping propulsion to meet the mission lifetime requirements. The objective was met, and the mission was adjudged successful 30 Oct. Westar 2 joined Westar 1, launched 13 April 1974 and later placed in geosynchronous orbit at 99° W longitude. The Westar Satellite Communications System—consisting of Westar 1 and 2, a third satellite for later launch, and five ground stations—had the potential for general-purpose telecommunications throughout the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Western Union planned to make the system available to all users, largely through leasing the voice, TV, and data transmitting services. NASA would be reimbursed for the launch, (nasa mors, 1, 25 Nov 74; nasa Releases 74-147, 74-265; Westar Release, 12 Sept 74; SBD, 11 Oct 74,214)
The Federal Aviation Administration issued an airworthiness directive ordering all DC-10 jumbo jet aircraft operators to make certain that cargo holds were locked and pressurized before the aircraft left the ground. Evidence had increased speculation that the 3 March crash of a DC—10 Turkish airliner had been caused by a faulty rear cargo door. In addition, operators were required to observe normal pressurization of aircraft during the initial flight period. If pressurization problems did occur, the aircraft was to be depressurized and brought down at the nearest suitable airport. (AP, B Sun, 7 March 74, A2)
NASA announced two Kennedy Space Center contract awards for space shuttle facilities. Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc., had been given a $21 812 737 contract to construct a space shuttle runway with overruns, apron, taxiway, and access roads. The runway—to be completed within 850 days after the notice to proceed—was to be built northwest of the Vehicle Assembly Building. Reynolds, Smith, and Hills received a $1 463 000 fixed-price contract to design modifications to Launch Complex 39 and Mobile Launcher 3 for shuttle operations. Complex 39, Apollo and Skylab launch site, would next be used for a manned flight in 1975, for the U.S.—U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. (NASA Releases 74-66, 74-67)
NASA officials testified on the proposal to lease a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and on the closing of Plum Brook Station, during FY 1975 authorization hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology. Associate Deputy Administrator Willis H. Shapley said NASA recommended lease instead of Government ownership and operation for four reasons. First, contracting for services would be as cost-effective as a conventional network of ground stations. Second, expenditures would be deferred to years when resulting savings could be realized. Funding required to procure a NASA-owned TDRSS would reduce the resources that could be applied to important mainline programs. Third, industrial technology was ready to provide the needed services. Fourth, the proposed arrangement was consistent with long-standing policies and practice of the Government to rely on industry for communications services. Acting Associate Administrator Edwin C. Kilgore of NASA’s Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology testified that Lewis Research Center’s Plum Brook Station, which was to be closed by June 1974 because of FY 1974 Civil Service work force cuts, would keep its Space Power Facility on standby. The Air Force, Navy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Atomic Energy Commission, and other agencies were considering using the facility—the world’s largest space environment facility, which included a unique solar simulation system. Also, NASA’s cooperative program with the National Science Foundation to study wind-driven energy devices was based at Plum Brook. LeRC Director Bruce T. Lundin reported that reduction-in-force notices had been sent to 177 Civil Service employees 11 March, following 180 in the past year, out of LeRc’s 400 separations. Dr. Kilgore said 50 engineers and technicians would be retained for the Space Power Facility at Plum Brook, which once employed 600 workers. (Transcript)
Aerospace companies that had succeeded in using the system approach to develop advanced technology for use in space were encountering difficulties in the field of urban mass transportation, a New York Times article said. Boeing Co. Aerospace Div. faced losses of up to $6 million on an automated “people mover” shuttle system in Morgantown, W. Va. Cost of the project, chosen four years ago as a pilot application of aerospace management techniques, had jumped from the original estimate of S13.4 million to $115 million. Rohr Industries, Inc., had lost more than $10 million on a project to build 450 commuter cars for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit System, which had threatened to sue Rohr over late deliveries and alleged unreliability of some cars. Observers had noted that aerospace technologists tended to “overengineer” transit systems, increasing costs, aggravating maintenance, and marring reliability. In addition there were problems in converting prototypes to hardware that could withstand the rigors of carrying throngs of people. But, despite the frustrations, more companies were entering the competition. A significant test of how the aerospace industry would fare in the next era of transit development would be the performance of Boeing’s Vertol Div. in two projects to produce 230 streetcars for Boston and San Francisco and 100 cars for Chicago’s rapid transit system. (Lindsey, AFT1,21 April 74, 3:1) Dr. Alastair G. W. Cameron, Harvard College Observatory scientist, said that an enormous spherical cloud of comets with a combined mass 20 times that of Jupiter might lie beyond the planets and form a far more massive part of the universe than the planets. This cloud, the Oort cloud, might be a repository for heavy elements formed since the infancy of the Milky Way. Dr. R. W. Klebesadel of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory said that satellites, placed in a 100 000-km orbit as part of the Air Force Vela series developed to monitor the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has monitored 27 high-intensity explosions in space over four years. The explosions, which had produced unusually large amounts of gamma and x-ray energy, might be in the Orion arm of the galaxy, where the earth was. Dr. Philip Morrison of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said nine current theories of the origin of the explosions included exploding stars, or supernovas; objects falling into neutron stars; and unusually large solar flares or sunstorms on distant stars.

NASA began “Outlook for Aeronautics,” a comprehensive 10-mo planning study to assess aeronautical challenges and opportunities for 1980-2000. Under the leadership of Dr. Leonard Roberts, Director of Aeronautics and Flight Systems at Ames Research Center, representatives of NASA, Federal Aviation Administration, and Dept, of Defense would survey NASA, industry, and Government to determine probable directions of civil and military aviation, technological advances needed, and the role of NASA. In a 4 Oct. letter to nasa employees Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said, “We want to produce a study that will assist nasa in presenting the best possible aeronautics program relevant to national needs, for the remainder of this century, to the Administration, the Congress, and the people.” In the aeronautical world market, the U.S. had sold more than $235 billion worth of products—not including space products—over the past 25 yrs, maintaining a favorable balance of trade for a nation that might otherwise have been in the red. In preparing this long-range study, “we have the great responsibility of indicating how America’s pre-eminent position in areonautics can be maintained and enhanced. The stakes are too high for any other approach.” (NASA Activities, 15 Oct 74, 2-3, 11-13; NASA oast, Civil Aircraft Progs Off, interview, 13 Nov 75) .
The Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences’ Subcommittee on Aviation held hearings to determine whether the Federal Aviation Administration and McDonnell Douglas Corp. had dealt adequately with cargo door problems on the DC-10 aircraft. Experts believed that the door had caused a 12 June 1972 near crash in Canada and the 3 March 1974 crash outside Paris that killed all 346 persons aboard. Documents had revealed that, following the Canadian incident, the FAA had drafted an airworthiness directive requiring three improvements in the suspect rear cargo door. McDonnell Douglas appealed to the FAA, which then agreed to let the company issue voluntary service bulletins. An inspection of all 134 in-service DC—10s after the Paris crash had showed that two aircraft, including the Turkish airliner, had not been modified despite McDonnell Douglas records to the contrary. Seven months after the Canadian incident the FAA, at the suggestion of the National Transportation Safety Board, had asked the company to consider a redesign of the vital systems, reinforcement of the passenger cabin floor, and more pressure vents. In a 25 Feb. 1974 letter to the FAA, McDonnell Douglas said that they did not “have the manpower available at this time to undertake the study, nor are we in a position to accept this burden alone.” (Egan, W Post, 23 March 74, A4; 27 March 74, A2; Wilkin, NYT, 21 March 74,1; 26 March 74,1)
The House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Transportation approved a Federal Aviation Administration budget request of -63 million to begin the Aeronautical Satellite (Aerosat) system. The two-satellite system, to be built in cooperation with the European Space Research Organization and Canada, would provide over-the-ocean communications for aircraft. In Subcommittee hearings faa Administrator Alexander P. Butterfield said recent changes in the program had eliminated airline opposition. The changes would limit the size and cost of the program, preclude the imposition of user charges on aircraft operators for recovery of r&d costs, eliminate any commitment for a follow-on operational system, include a very-high-frequency capability for evaluation against L-band, and limit the number of earth terminals. Signing of a- Memorandum of Understanding by the participants was pending Senate approval of the faa budget request. (Subcom Staff Off, interview; Av Wk, 8 April 74,21; SBD, 3 April 74,190)
NASA’s equal employment opportunity program was reviewed during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said that during the 1970s NASA faced the challenge of catching up in a most important area of human need. The challenge would be difficult because the NASA work force had decreased by nearly one third. In addition, 47% of the NASA work force were scientists and engineers. Of these, 3.4% were minorities, while the nationwide percentage of minorities in this category was 3.5%, and these persons were in high demand in private industry, where starting salaries were $1200 to $1700 per year higher. Dr. Dudley G. McConnell, NASA Assistant Administrator for Equal Opportunity Programs, said NASA would during 1974 achieve a minority complement of 6.1% of the total permanent work force, hiring 80 minority members and 80 women into professional positions. In addition NASA would help increase the availability of technically trained women and minority members by NASA’s cooperative education program and by initiating an aerospace fellowship program. Mrs. Ruth Bates Harris, former NASA Deputy Assistant Administrator for Equal Opportunity Programs, testified that NASA had turned away qualified women and minority applicants. She said NASA ranked 22 out of 26 agencies in percentage of female attorneys. Also, although NASA had a 47% scientific and engineering work force, in the 53% nonscientific and technical category NASA had a 3.7% minority participation, not significantly better than the 3.6% in the scientific and engineering category.

A Baltimore Sun editorial commented on NASA’s space program and the 8 Feb. splashdown of Skylab 4: “The Apollo moon missions and Skylab have moved NASA to a point where few if any scientists any longer condemn the space program as ‘more circus than science,’ and Skylab, especially, has given manned spaceflight an unassailable new reputation as a superb scientific instrument. ... It is unfortunate that the space program entered its most useful and significant period in conjunction with the loss of interest in space on the part of a public obsessed with Watergate and the energy crisis” but “there are no indications the American people wish to junk the space program.” NASA’s FY 1975 budget included promising projects. “The evolution of man into spaceman has just begun and there are wondrous things ahead.” (B Sun, 9 Feb 74)
The fact that fewer and fewer young people are entering the field of aeronautics” was endangering the U.S. aeronautical position, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said in a speech before the NASA-University Conference on Aeronautics at the Univ. of Kansas. The number of college students in junior classes in aerospace engineering had dropped 75% during 1968-1973, although civil aeronautics export business had increased fivefold in the past 10 yrs. Total civil and military aerospace exports were expected to reach $7 billion in 1974, with a “self-evident” importance to the U.S. balance of payments. U.S.-designed and -produced transport aircraft formed 80% of the non-Communist world’s transport fleets. Because of the increasing system complexity, costs, foreign competition, and complex environmental and economic problems, it was “clear that the support of the research and technology critical to the future health of civil aeronautics will depend on heavier government involvement.” NASA was “prepared to support a stronger aeronautics research and technology effort” and had organized a long-range study group to evaluate the “Outlook for Aeronautics” in the 1980-2000 period. A report was due in the summer of 1975. Among possible technology goals, Dr. Fletcher was convinced that aircraft fuel savings of 50% within the next 20 yrs could be reached, through weight reductions by composite structures and fly-by-wire and active controls and through supercritical aerodynamics, advanced engine techniques, and operational methods. NASA would also give special attention to technology for alternative fuels, such as hydrogen. (Text)

Myers would rejoin Rockwell International Corp. as president of a new aircraft group with headquarters in Los Angeles. Myers, who had headed all NASA manned space flight programs since January 1970, had received the NASA Certificate of Appreciation in 1969 for his contributions to the Apollo 8 moon-orbiting mission, the NASA Public Service Award in 1969 for his contributions to the Apollo 11 landing mission, and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1971 for his contributions to the continued success of the Apollo program. Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider had been named Acting Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight. (NASA Release 74-42)
Radioactive material like that which had leaked from an improperly shielded container on two 5 and 6 April Delta Air Lines, Inc., flights, and germs, bacteria, and nerve gas were shipped routinely on commercial aircraft, the Washington Post reported. The Post quoted an Atomic Energy Commission investigation as saying that 1 million shipments of radioactive material had been made during 1973. Medical isotopes had accounted for 95% of the total. On 20 March the Air Line Pilots Association had asked the Federal Aviation Administration to ban the shipment of radioactive material by air temporarily. (Conlan, W Post, 15 April 74, A6)
Research into automotive propulsion systems was reviewed by NASA, Dept, of Transportation, and Environmental Protection Agency officials in hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. H.R. 10392 had been introduced 19 Sept. 1973 to authorize nasa research toward development of economical, energy-conserving systems with clean emissions and improved performance. Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, testified 4 Feb. that Lewis Research Center was testing epa’s experimental engine, under a June 1973 agreement with epa on work toward a low-pollution gas-turbine-powered vehicle. Upgraded engine work would be completed by mid-1975 and vehicle performance evaluation before the end of CY 1975. First results of Jet Propulsion Laboratory investigations of hydrogen injection into fuel to improve efficiency and reduce pollution in conventional automobile engines promised achievement of 1977 Federal emission standards with 25% improvement in fuel economy. LeRC Director Bruce T. Lundin testified that, in addition to the gas turbine engine, a broader, longer range, advanced technology program was under way, with 13 industry contracts for such improvements as a low-emission combustor, higher-temperature heat exchangers, lower-cost turbine discs, turbine wheel cooling, and low-cost fuel controls. Dr. William H. Pickering, Jpl Director, reported a test automobile using bottled gas to inject hydrogen into the fuel had already met the carbon monoxide emission standard and had almost met the nitrogen oxide standard, although the hydrocarbon emissions remained a problem. With engine modifications to produce hydrogen from gasoline, instead of using bottled gas, performance per gallon of fuel was expected to improve 25% over the conventional engine. (Transcript) 4- 8 February: The first meeting of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization’s Assembly of Parties was held in Washington, D.C. Seventy-two of the eighty-four member governments were represented. Raymond J. Waldmann (U.S.) was elected Chairman and Dr. Osama Anani (Jordan) was elected Deputy Chairman. Elected as Vice-chairmen were Ambassador Alejandro Orfila (Argentina), Ambassador Adolfo Alessandrini (Italy), Ambassador Leonard 0. Kibinge (Kenya), and Ambassador Motoo Ogiso (Japan). The Assembly of Parties found that the proposed U.S. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (goes) and maritime satellite system would not interfere with the intelsat system, goes was technically compatible with the use of the radio-frequency spectrum and orbital space by the existing or planned satellites. The maritime satellite system would not prejudice direct satellite telecommunication links. The Assembly refused a United Nations request for free use of INTELSAT satellites, although a priority access arrangement, for periods not exceeding 90 days during an emergency, would be worked out. (intelsat Release 74-12). 5- 22 February: Mariner 10, launched 3 Nov. 1973, passed within 5800 km of Venus—within 15 km of the planned aim point—at 1:01 pm edt 5 Feb. The encounter sequence was accomplished according to plan and data were transmitted over the 45 million km between the earth and Venus at a rate of 117.6 kilobits per sec. Excellent ultraviolet cloud-structure pictures and new data on particle environment and mass, density, and shape of the planet were returned. Because Mariner 10 approached Venus on the dark side, the TV sequence was not begun until shortly before the encounter, at 12:21 pm edt. The spacecraft flew behind Venus at 1:07 pm edt for 20 min; TV signals were stored on tape and recovered without difficulty after Mariner 10 emerged from the occultation zone. During occultation, the spacecraft’s radio antenna was aimed toward the edge of the planet so that the radio signals were bent around Venus by the extremely dense atmosphere and sent on to the earth. All science instruments functioned normally except the scanning electrostatic analyzer. The TV sequence was completed 13 Feb. after some 4165 pictures were returned to the earth. During the flyby, the 503-kg spacecraft used the gravitational field of Venus to slow its speed and direct the flight path toward a 29 March encounter with Mercury. By 22 Feb. Mariner 10—its speed increasing as it came nearer the sun—was traveling 3 million km per day toward the planet. Preliminary science results were presented at a press briefing 7 Feb. at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Herbert S. Bridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, said the solar wind was interacting with the ionosphere of Venus, producing a magnetic tail that could be detected as a modified plasma flow as far out from the planet as 500 Venus radii. Dr. James A. Dunne, Mariner project scientist, said the magnetic field doubled just before radio occultation but that no evidence of an intrinsic planetary magnetic field was found. Preliminary radio science results indicated that Venus was very round, 100 times less oblate than the earth, and confirmed that Venus had a dayside ionosphere. The mass of the planet was slightly less than that derived from previous data. Hydrogen was a major element of the Venus cloud deck, possibly present in droplets of sulfuric acid as well as water vapor. Manner 10 found no evidence of deuterium on the planet, indicating that the hydrogen had originated from the solar wind. Helium, carbon, and atomic oxygen were found in the atmosphere, with possible traces of argon and neon. Outer atmosphere temperature of 590 K (600°F) was suggested. TV data indicated a uniform main cloud deck with three or four layers and a stratified haze layer. TV pictures in uv showed a classical “Y” feature that originated in the equatorial region and spiraled toward the pole. Clear circulation patterns could be seen at the poles, caused by rising gas transporting excess solar heat from the equatorial zone by convection. The atmosphere was smooth, with no swirling storms, (nasa mor, 11 March 74; Briefing transcript; Sullivan, NYT, 5 Feb. 74, 18; 6 Feb. 74, 1; Miles, LA Times, 6 Feb 74)

Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, Apollo 17 astronaut and now Special Assistant to the NASA Administrator for Energy Research and Development, testified in Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences hearings on FY 1975 authorizations: One of the most important contributions NASA could make to energy research and development was the application of managerial techniques developed in the space program, permitting programs, schedules, and budgets to be defined and then adhered to without major degradation of the original goals. “This mission-oriented approach to research and development and its broad integration of the great capabilities and imagination of industry will... be applied just as successfully to the critical problems that face the Nation and the world in energy.” (Transcript)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Housing and Urban Development Secretary James T. Lynn signed and sent to the President and Congress their agencies’ joint plan for implementing the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974. Under the Act, signed 3 Sept., NASA was responsible for development and procurement of solar equipment. HUD would coordinate the demonstration, including installation of solar equipment in residential structures, and collecting and disseminating information about solar energy, (msfc Release 7dr-246)
The Federal Aviation Administration announced a proposed new regulation requiring fuel tanks and fuel venting spaces on turbine-powered transports over 5670 kg to be equipped with explosion-prevention systems. Under the proposal, aircraft operators and manufacturers could use a system that maintained a continuous nonflammable atmosphere, such as nitrogen, or a system that arrested a fire or explosion once initiated. All turbine aircraft manufactured two years after the effective date of the final rule would be required to be fitted with this equipment within three years, (faa Release 74-4,7)
The papers of Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, NASA Deputy Administrator from 1958 until his death in 1965, were opened to the public in ceremonies at Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, Md. The papers would be housed in the university’s Milton S. Eisenhower Library. (NASA Release 74-120; NASA Hist Off)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in energy research and development with the Electric Power Research Institute (epri). Dr. Chauncey Starr, President of epri, had signed the agreement 24 Nov. The agencies would cooperate in applying safety, reliability, and quality assurance techniques developed for the space program to electric power generating plants and in research and technology development for advanced energy systems, (nasa oast pio, interview, 3 Sept 75; NASA Release 74-325)
The Federal Aviation Administration proposed a new safety regulation that would require all shipments of radioactive material on passenger and cargo aircraft to be inspected for leakage and scanned with radiation monitoring instruments before flight. On passenger flights, radiation monitors would check the cabin floor above the cargo hold before departure and the cargo compartment after the aircraft had landed. The FAA proposal had been prompted by incidents of improper packaging that had exposed passengers and crew members to higher-than-normal radiation levels [see 9-10 April]. (faa Release 74-59)
Tentative NASA plans for launching 810 payloads into space in the next two decades were outlined by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in an address before the National Space Club in Washington, D.C. The total, for late 1973 to 1991, included non-NASA payloads for Government agencies (other than the Dept, of Defense), foreign agencies, and private industry. The tentative payload model—presented to Congress in October 1973 to show “what could be done in the 1980s” when the space shuttle was in use—included as many as 10 missions to the outer planets Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, and Saturn. In 1990 and 1991 two very heavy payloads might be sent to orbit one of Jupiter’s moons and land an instrument package. Tentative missions to the inner planets included five missions to Venus, one of them with a lander, and two spacecraft to orbit Mercury. Tentative Mars missions included one spacecraft to orbit the planet, two landers, and two to return samples from the two moons of Mars. Lunar missions under consideration included a lunar polar orbiter in 1979, two other orbiters in the 1980s, two lunar rovers in the 1980s, a lunar halo satellite to ensure communications with the hidden side of the moon, and two lunar rovers in 1990 and 1991 that could return samples to the earth from any point on the moon. Other plans under consideration were a flyby and rendezvous with Comet Encke and a landing on the nucleus, a flyby of Haley’s Comet in 1985, and two missions to asteroids in 1986. Of the 810 total payloads, 57 were designated for planetary exploration and 753 for earth orbit. Scientific satellites for earth orbit were Large Space Telescopes, High Energy Astronomical Observatories, Large Solar Observatories, Large Radio Astronomy Observatories, and x-ray telescopes. The large spacecraft would be unmanned but visited regularly by space shuttle crews and brought back to earth for refurbishing. In the applications field were large Earth Observatory Satellites. And NASA expected to orbit 120 communications and navigation satellites for other agencies or private industry through 1991, not including those for DOD. Of some 300 payloads to be flown in the Spacelab, most would be NASA payloads in the fields of astronomy, physics, earth observations, earth and ocean physics, communication and navigation, life science, and space technology. Of non-NASA payloads, 10 would be for private industry space processing, beginning in 1985. Some 10% were expected to be flown for foreign users. The large number of contemplated missions, even with the increasing number of U.S.S.R. launches, was expected to have very little impact on the environment. Effects of the major constituents of the solid-fueled rocket booster exhaust—water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and aluminum oxide—would be negligible. (Text)
President Ford as a Congressman had been a “staunch defender of space spending” whenever critics suggested cuts in NASA’s budget, the San Diego Union reported. As minority leader, Ford had declared that the space program could be justified by its spinoffs. In April 1972, Ford had defended a $200-million space shuttle appropriation because he had believed that its loss would end the space program. (Macomber, SD Union, 8 Sept 74,19) With President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Mstislav V. Keldysh, Dr. Fletcher visited the space flight control center near Moscow, from which the ASTP mission would be controlled in July 1975. Dr. Fletcher also visited the cosmonaut training center and the Apollo-Soyuz laboratory center with the head of the Intercosmos Council, Academician Boris N. Petrov, and discussed Soviet-American cooperation in exploration and peaceful uses of outer space with Deputy Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers Vladimir A. Kirillin, (nasa Off of Admin, Daily Appointments Calendar; Tass, fbis-Sov, 12 Sept 74, U1; 13 Sept 74, U1)
An agreement to establish an Aerosat (Aeronautical Satellite) Space Segment Program was signed in Washington by the European Space Research Organization, comsat General Corp., and the Government of Canada. Under the agreement—provided for in the Memorandum of Understanding signed 2 Aug.—esro, comsat General, and Canada would furnish the space segment capability for the intergovernmental program. comsat General would lease its share of the space segment capability to the Federal Aviation Administration, (esro Release, 3 Dec 74)
An experimental scanning laser doppler system, originally developed at Marshall Space Flight Center to measure atmospheric winds and turbulence, was being tested at msfc to determine the system’s reliability in detecting and monitoring aircraft wake vortices. Flyby tests had been conducted by msfc and the Federal Aviation Administration at Redstone Arsenal using a Boeing Co. 720 aircraft and two laser doppler units. Early results indicated that, in addition to detecting the vortices, the laser doppler system provided data on the air speeds within them. Two experimental systems would be used in field tests at Kennedy International Airport in New York after checkout of the units was completed. (nasa Release 74-127)

The three-hour match, won by Ali by a decision, was transmitted to Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Jamaica, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Nicaragua, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Thailand, United Kingdom, Venezuela, and Zaire. (ComSatCorp Release 74-6; W Star-News Library) 28 January-1 February: The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics held its 10th Annual Meeting and Technical Display 28—30 Jan. and 12th Aerospace Sciences Meeting 30 Jan.-l Feb. in Washington, D.C. “Spaceship Earth—A New Perspective” was the theme of the meeting, chaired by Dr. Wernher von Braun, Vice President of Fairchild Industries, Inc., and former Marshall Space Flight Center Director and NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning. At the honors banquet 30 Jan. Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center, received the Louis W. Hill Space Transportation Award for 1973 for scientific, engineering, and organizational contributions to manned and unmanned space missions, beginning with the first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, in 1958.

NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers testified on the manned space program before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight during FY 1975 authorization hearings. Myers said NASA’s ability to hold close to the original cost target for the space shuttle in spite of schedule adjustments in the last two years was “due to bringing on our contractors below our cost estimates” and the ability 6f the management structure to remain dynamic and react to changes and “surprise problems.” He was confident that the average-cost-per-flight commitment of $10.5 million in 1971 dollars would be maintained. However, resolution of the protested selection of Thiokol Corp. for the solid-fueled rocket motor contract was necessary before work on the motor could begin; “a timely start of this . . . activity is very important to orderly progress in the shuttle development schedule.” In the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the astp spacecraft was to be delivered to Kennedy Space Center in the fall, joint docking system qualification testing and preflight docking system compatibility tests were to be completed during the winter, experiment hardware was to be qualified by early spring, and flight readiness activities were to be conmleted by spring, leading to the July launch. NASA had allocated $13 million for experiments for astp. More than 140 proposals from the scientific community had been evaluated by eminent scientists and medical doctors. The final, “first-rate” experiment package had been given final approval by the Administrator. Following astp, two Saturn Vs, two Saturn IBs, one complete and one partially complete command and service module, the unused Skylab backup Workshop cluster, and one astp docking module and system would remain unused. Acquisition cost of the hardware was $870 million. With the conclusion of the programs, the hardware would be stored. Total storage costs per year would be $100 000. After FY 1975, disposition of the hardware would have to be considered. (Transcript)

Dr. Malcolm R. Currie, Dept, of Defense Director of Defense Research and Engineering, testified on dod space programs before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1975 NASA authorization hearings: dod would provide an interim, upper, orbit-to-orbit stage (oos) for initial use with NASA’s space shuttle until NASA could develop a permanent space tug. The oos, which would provide the high orbits necessary for about 60% of military payloads, would be a low-cost modification of an existing upper stage and would be phased to coincide with the first operation of the shuttle orbiter in 1980. About $3.0 million would he spent in FY 1975 to select stage configuration and initiate detailed specifications. The oos would have no payload retrieval capability and might not be reusable but could be used by NASA or any other shuttle user during early shuttle operations, dod would install facilities to provide initial shuttle capability at Vandenberg Air Force Base in December 1982. Shuttle hardware, software, operating procedures, and ground equipment would be common and interchangeable to the maximum extent possible between KSC and Vandenberg. During FY 1974 DOD had initiated the development and validation plan for the navstar Global Positioning System, using satellites to provide worldwide precise positioning and navigation, accurate to tens of meters. The system, usable for civilian purposes as well as military, would halt the proliferation of specialized systems. The Navy’s Fleet Satellite Communications System (fltsatcom) , to provide reliable beyond-the-horizon communications for command and control of mobile DOD forces, was “well into development.” Terminal equipment for the fleet would be installed in FY 1975 and FY 1976 and would be operated through minimal leased transponders in Communication Satellite Corp.’s Maritime Communications Satellite System pending full operation of fltsatcom in 1976. Three operational early warning satellites were in geostationary orbit. DOD would seek to improve coverage and mission duration and continue development of a simplified processing station. Two Lincoln Experimental Satellites, comsats les 8 and 9 scheduled for 1975 launch, would use radioisotope thermoelectric generators instead of solar cell arrays. The Space Detection and Tracking System (spadats), which could cover up to 5600 km, would he expanded. DOD was working on detectors, target discrimination, data processing, and other critical optical and radar components, to reach a near-real-time ground-based capability by FY 1978 to detect, track, and identify all objects up to 36 000-km altitude.

Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr. Alexander Hocker, European Space Research Organization Director General, held a Spacelab program review in Paris to assess the proposed esro design, appraise an esro presentation of contractor evaluation and findings, and discuss follow-on production. The review indicated that size, "volume, subsystems, transportability, and operational turnaround met or exceeded design requirements. The design payload weight had been reduced from phase B results. An esro team with NASA support would further assess the weight, and the common payload support equipment and instrument pointing system would be studied for nine months. NASA would give a letter of commitment to buy one flight unit with follow-on production commitment scheduled after critical design review, (nasa Gen Mgmt Rev Rpt, 17 June 74; NASA Spacelab Newsletter 74-5; 3 July 74)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said in his article “Are Skylab and the Space Shuttle Worth the Investment?” in Government Executive that everything done in the Skylab program—with total runout costs of $2.6 billion through FY 1974—had been necessary for future progress in space. He believed the Skylab team had “taken another giant leap for mankind comparable to the first step upon the Moon or the first satellite in Earth orbit.” And even if the shuttle were not expected to save $1 billion a year in launch and payload costs, as it was—after an $8-billion 1972-1991 investment—the U.S. “should still build it. We cannot run Spaceship Earth without it.” We could not “begin to think of obtaining solar power from collectors in space without the Shuttle; we cannot hope to unlock the still hidden energy secrets of the Sun and stars without improved space observatories launched by the Shuttle; we cannot hope to develop the tools for management of natural resources and protection of our environment on a global scale without manned and unmanned Earth observatories launched and serviced by the advantages of a ‘hydrogen economy’ in the future unless we are willing to support such important steps toward that future as a hydrogen-fueled Shuttle. In short, there is no new frontier in space for America and mankind without the Shuttle.” (Govt Exec, Jan 74,38-42) February 1974
Safety was of prime importance to NASA management and NASA-Soviet joint working groups planning the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said in a letter to Sen. William Proxmire (D—Wis.). The response to a Sen. Proxmire letter expressing concern for astp crew safety in light of past failures of the Soyuz and Salyut spacecraft explained that NASA had requested and received from the Soviets a detailed explanation of the Soyuz 11 (6-30 June 1971) failure, in which three cosmonauts were killed, and of the test program to correct the problem. NASA officials had also asked for information on the 26-29 Aug. Soyuz 15 mission, which astp technical personnel were expected to discuss during joint meetings 9-23 Sept. (Letter, Proxmire to Fletcher, 3 Sept 74; letter, Fletcher to Proxmire, 10 Sept 74)
The Library of Congress Congressional Research Service published United States and Soviet Progress in Space: Summary Data through 1972 and a Forward Look (74-35SP), prepared by Dt. Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of the Science Policy Research Div. In its manned program the U.S.S.R. had launched a Salyut 2 space station 3 April 1973 but a failure—possibly a wildly firing thruster—had damaged the station, which reentered the earth’s atmosphere May 28. Other later attempts to launch and man a space station also appeared to have failed. Two manned launches, Soyuz 12 and Soyuz 13, had been successful in September and December, the second spacecraft remaining in space eight days to conduct astrophysical, biological, and earth resources experiments. By 30 June 1974 the United States expected to have spent $75 billion on combined military and civilian space programs since the beginning of the space program, spending about $4.7 billion in FY 1974. The Soviet Union did not publish space budget data, but its program was thought to be “at least of the same magnitude as that of the United States at its former peak” of $7.7 billion a year. The U.S. had several major space research and development centers operated by the military and private industry as well as NASA. There was no reason to believe the Soviet aerospace industry was as fully equipped but missiles of similar capabilities and different design philosophies which had appeared in Moscow parades “suggest the existence of more than one design and development team for space work.” The U.S. had launch vehicles scaled to lift payloads weighing from 9 kg to 136 000 kg. The Soviet Union had started to use in 1957 its original intercontinental ballistic missile and still used the same basic vehicle with stages added to improve performance. The very large Soviet vehicle predicted by NASA officials had not been seen. A Soviet lunar landing did not seem imminent but was still expected, as part of Soviet long-range plans, as soon as the problems of unreliable hardware were solved. U.S.—U.S.S.R. cooperation in space efforts was “the hope of well-intentioned people everywhere.” Two motives for cooperation were to lessen tension and to save money. Although there was already exchange of information between scientists and engineers, “no assessment of the overall prospects can be made successfully without forecasting the future political climate.” (Text) Despite the loss of the prime power chain, causing automatic transfer to the backup system, Mariner 10’s instruments continued scientific studies. Comet Kohoutek’s tail was observed in the extreme ultraviolet range. On 13 Jan. hydrogen Lyman-alpha intensity, beginning 20° from the comet’s nucleus, climbed rapidly as the nucleus region drifted toward the uv airglow spectrometer’s field of view. The nucleus was scanned 16 Jan. On 17 Jan., while the spacecraft was powered down for its second trajectory correction maneuver, shutting off several instrument heaters allowed the TV optics heaters, which had failed to function earlier, to turn on. Scientists had feared that below-freezing temperature might prevent camera operation during the Venus encounter. On 21 Jan., instruments for Comet Kohoutek and solar wind experiments were turned on. On 22 Jan. the uv spectrometer measured hydrogen Lyman-alpha intensities out to 17° to map the comet’s hydrogen cloud. Comet Kohoutek was scanned seven hours 24 Jan. by the UV spectrometer—the only instrument of its kind to observe the comet from outside the earth’s own hydrogen cloud. During the seventh and final roll calibration maneuver 28 Jan., telemetry indicated a rapid increase in the use of attitude control gas, the nitrogen gas supply dropping from 2.7 to 2.1 kg. The gyros were turned off and the spacecraft put into celestial control, with the sun and the star Canopus as references. Nitrogen-gas-use rate returned to normal and estimates of the supply indicated a comfortable margin for reaching Mercury and executing experiments. The backup electric power system was still in use, as studies of that problem continued. On 31 Jan. Mariner 10 was 3 200 000 km from Venus and 38 800 000 km from the earth, traveling at 30 238 km per hr.
