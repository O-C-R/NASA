Galileo�s tape recorder, which had been balky, is again working. Scientists will avoid using the magnetic tape near either end of the reel to reduce the power needed to operate the recorder.

�National Leadership/National Partnership� is NASA�s theme at the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Fly-In Convention and Sport Aviation Exhibition July 27-August 2 at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. A featured exhibit identifies unique partnerships formed between government, industry, and academia to revitalize the general aviation industry in areas ranging from modernizing cockpits to reducing aircraft weight and cost. Highlighted are activities of selected companies developing general aviation technology through the NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIRP) program. (NASA Releases 95-119, 128, 129 & 174)
An internal NASA review team has produced proposals that include sweeping management and organizational changes to cut spending an additional $5 billion by the end of the decade. (NASA Releases 95-65, 73, 123 & 132; NY Times, May 20/95)
An early goal of NASA�s proposed New Millennium program is to test highly sophisticated space hardware to prove that scientific spacecraft can be built more than 30 percent smaller without sacrificing performance. The first New Millennium spacecraft will explore a comet, an asteroid, or some combination of them. Three deep space missions are to be flown by the year 2000.

A new generation of air traffic control tools are being field tested at the Denver International Airport. The Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) became its primary traffic management tool the day it opened on February 28. CTAS was designed with the involvement of the ultimate users, the controllers and the pilots. It consists of three software systems: the Decent Advisor (DA), an air/ground datalink system, and advanced cockpit automation. The DA has routinely met its goal of reducing arrival time prediction accuracy to under 20 seconds. In addition to reducing traffic controller workload, CTAS will increase aircraft fuel efficiency and reduce delays. The field tests are jointly conducted by NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which contemplate more such fruitful partnerships in the future.

Supersonic Laminar Flow Control (SLFC) experiment may apply to High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) which could fly twice as fast as today�s typical airliner. SLFC is a special structure mounted on the wing of an F-16XL. (NASA Releases 95-124 & 184; Interavia, Jan/95; AvWk, Oct 23/95)
The Chicago Fire Department has signed a Space Act agreement to explore ways space technology can be used to enhance emergency services. Candidate activities include: locating firefighters within a 2,400 foot area; monitoring the vibration signature of a burning structure to determine when the firefighters must be evacuated; checking into the feasibility of using liquid oxygen in a new breathing apparatus; identifying the location of an emergency 911 call made from a cellular phone; and warning hearing impaired drivers of an approaching emergency vehicle.
