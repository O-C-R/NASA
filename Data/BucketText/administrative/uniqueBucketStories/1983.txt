NASA said that it had signed a contract with Fairchild Industries for design and development of an unmanned space platform called Leasecraft, to be deployed from the Shuttle to serve commercial and government users. James M. Beggs, NASA administrator, said that the move was consistent with administration plans to promote space exploitation by commercial firms. Fairchild said that the platform, which would measure 15 by 15 by 9.5 feet and carry power and command and data-handling modules with other equipment needed by various payloads, would cost more than $200 million. Payloads would include materials-processing and remote-sensing equipment and scientific experiments. (NASA Release 83-143)
At 8 a.m. EDT June 13, unmanned U.S. spacecraft Pioneer 10 crossed the orbit of Neptune on the way out of the solar system. The 570-pound robot craft 2.81 billion miles from the Sun and traveling 30,558 mph at the time.

. The prototype Shuttle Enterprise, returning from an overseas tour that included the Paris air show, flew over Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Md., early in the morning before landing at Dulles airport in Virginia for public viewing at a distance. “Hundreds of thousands,” according to the Washington Post, came to see the Shuttle, “despite soaring temperatures.” Enterprise, and its Boeing 747 transport jet left for California the next day.

Scientists at ARC said that Pioneer 10 would be nearly 2.8 billion miles beyond the Sun at 2 p.m. PDT, when it passed the orbit of Pluto, traveling 30,000 mph on its way outside the solar system. The first manmade object to reach such a distance, Pioneer 10 might go on for millions of years and carry Earth greetings to another galaxy. Launched March 2, 1972, the craft had functioned “almost with flaw,” said project manager Richard Fimmel. Because of its elliptical orbit, Pluto—usually the outermost planet—at this time was nearer than Neptune to the Sun and would travel inside Neptune’s orbit for the next 17 years. Pioneer 10 would cross Neptune’s orbit June 13, effectively leaving the solar system behind. Radio signals moving at the speed of light needed more than four hours to cross the distance between Earth and spacecraft; even after a decade in space, Pioneer 10 was transmitting data of great value to scientists. Since the date of its launch with a predicted lifetime of 21 months, long enough for a Jupiter encounter, Pioneer 10 signals over vastly increasing distances had remained detectable because of improvements in antenna sensitivity. NASA said that it hoped to track the craft for another eight years, to a distance of 5 billion miles, 2.2 billion miles beyond its present location.

Three U.S. biomedical experiments were flying aboard a Soviet spacecraft, Cosmos 1514, launched today. In an announcement following the launch, Moscow said only that “scientific experimental systems with various biological objects” were aboard and made no reference to foreign collaboration. However, NASA Administrator James M. Beggs disclosed that NASA had provided three pieces of medical equipment that the Soviets incorporated in the scientific payload of Cosmos 1514. Later, NASA said that the experiments had to do with blood system and biorhythm studies in monkeys and fetal development studies in rats. Beggs said that talks that paved the way for the Cosmos 1514 experiments were held “about five years ago.” Cosmos 1514 was recovered on December 19, 1983, and in May 1984 TASS reported that the rats on the flight were developing normally and that Soviet scientists believed the weightlessness did not affect the normal development of embryos.
