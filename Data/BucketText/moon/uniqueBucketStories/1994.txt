The Defense Department said that robot spacecraft Clementine suffered a malfunction on May 7 that would prevent it from flying by and photographing the asteroid Geographos. However, Clementine was to continue to perform a military mission that would test 23 "advanced technologies." On May 19 the managers of Clementine were to fire its main thruster to ease the craft into a circular path between the moon and Earth, where they can continue to test its prototype military components in the upper reaches of the Van Allen radiation belts around the planet. Since its January 25 launch, Clementine has provided 1.5 million images of the moon at a bargain price.

Robot spacecraft Clementine successfully completed a two-month mission to map the moon's surface in unprecedented detail. Radar data indicate what scientists term an "astonishing" depth of 7.5 miles in one of the moon's ancient basins. Other data may reveal ice in a permanently shadowed spot at the lunar south pole. At 6:20 p.m. EDT, controllers were to command the spacecraft to fire its rockets for four minutes to remove it from lunar orbit, loop around Earth, and head for the small asteroid 1620 Geographos for a late August rendezvous. NASA provided funding to refocus the mission effort, substituting the moon and asteroids for man-made "Star Wars" objects. (W Post, May 3/94; NY Times, May 4/94)
Various special television programs were scheduled to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the moon landing. In addition, the press planned to feature accounts recalling events of the first moonwalk.

Spence Armstrong, Associate Administrator for NASA's Office of Human Resources and Education, announced its Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). This was a three-year, $500,000 annual award to six states as a new initiative to improve their research and competitive capability while expanding education and training opportunities for women and minorities. The funding would enable states to develop an academic research enterprise for long-term, self-sustaining, nationally competitive capability, contributing to the states' economic viability. The involved states were Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
NASA astrophysicist Fred Espenak stated that an annular eclipse would be visible to observers within a 145-mile wide path from El Paso, Texas, through Toledo, Ohio, and much of New England on May 10. The moon will appear completely silhouetted against the sun, which will form a dazzling unbroken outer ring for up to six minutes. People outside the ground path will see only a partial eclipse.
