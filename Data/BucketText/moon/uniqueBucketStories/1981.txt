The New York Times said that launch pad 39A at KSC, earlier reported to have been seriously damaged by Columbia’s blastoff, suffered “very minimal” damage, according to a KSC damage-assessment team. Wayne C. Ranow, an assistant to pad-site manager Tip Tallone, supplied a preliminary list of items damaged and added that just a few more seconds of “hang time” before the Shuttle cleared the pad would have caused much more damage. NASA spokesman Hugh Harris said KSC had expected “a lot more damage than that;” although it would take two weeks to restore the pad this time, “we will learn from the experience and change some things” to avoid delays in the program. The impact of the 6.6 million pounds of thrust was “similar to what we saw with Apollo,” Harris said. (NYTimes, Apr 17/81, A-26)
