The X Prize Foundation announced that four new teams had registered for the Google Lunar X Prize competition, bringing the total number of registered teams to 14. The Google Lunar X Prize race would grant US$20 million to the first team to build a privately funded spacecraft that would land on the Moon, move 500 meters, and transmit data, images, and video back to Earth. The deadline for receiving the full purse had been set for 31 December 2012; after that date, the X Prize Foundation would reduce the value of the grand prize. The X Prize Foundation had also offered a second prize and bonus prizes. One of the new teams that had joined the competition was a mystery team. The contest rules permitted a team to keep its identity a secret until 20 July 2009. Also joining the race were the contest’s first Asian team, Team Advaeros of Malaysia, led by Hanidy Yusof; the Juxtopia Urban Robotics Brilliant Application National (JURBAN) team, led by Jayfus T. Doswell and composed of both professional and student engineers; and Team STELLAR, led by Richard D. Dell and based in North Carolina.(Space.com, “Four New Teams Join Moon Rover Race,” 22 May 2008, http://www.space.com/5383-teams-join- moon-rover-race.html (accessed 29 March 2011).)
The People’s Republic of China’s Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense released the first photographs that China had captured of the Moon’s polar regions. The 2,350-pound (1,066-kilogram) Chang’e-1 lunar probe had taken the photographs. Chang’e-1 had been orbiting the Moon at an altitude of 200 kilometers (124 miles) since 7 November 2007. On 4 January 2008, Chang’e-1’s cameras had adjusted, enabling them to photograph areas of the Moon above 70° north or south latitude. China intended the probe to produce a three-dimensional lunar-surface survey and to provide data and images for use in other experiments.(Xinhua News Agency, “Chang’e-1 Captures Pictures of Moon’s Polar Areas,” 31 January 2008, http://news. xinhuanet.com/english/2008-01/31/content_7532773.htm (accessed 14 December 2010).)
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced that its lunar orbiter craft, Chandrayaan 1, had dropped a Moon Impact Probe to the lunar surface. The 64-pound ( probe, which measured 14.70 inches (37.34 centimeters) by 14.7 inches ( by 18.5 inches (46.99 centimeters), landed on the Moon at 10:01 (EST). The probe’s mission was to test soft-landing technologies and to observe the lunar surface. It carried a mass spectrometer to study the lunar atmosphere, a radar altimeter to measure the probe’s altitude, and a video imaging system to photograph the descent. Chandrayaan 1, a US$80 million mission, had launched on 22 October 2008, joining China, Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States as the only nations that had sent missions to the Moon.(Space.com, “India Slams Probe into the Moon,” 14 November 2008, http://www.space.com/6113-india-slams- probe-moon.html (accessed 25 August 2011); Associated Press, “India’s First Lunar Probe Lands on the Moon,” 15 November 2008.)
