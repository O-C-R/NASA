Planetary scientists working with data from a Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune announced that the spacecraft had recorded wind speeds on the planet of up to 1,500 miles per hour. These wind speeds exceeded those observed on Saturn and were believed to be the highest in the solar system. The scientists also reported the discovery of at least two additional volcanic plumes on Neptune's moon, Triton. (AP, Dec 6/89; C Trib, Dec 6/89; NY Times, Dec 7/89)
