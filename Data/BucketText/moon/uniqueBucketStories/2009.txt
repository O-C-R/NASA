NASA announced that its Cassini craft had detected sodium salts in ice grains of Saturn’s outermost ring, an indication that Saturn’s moon Enceladus might harbor a reservoir of liquid water beneath its surface. In 2005 Cassini had discovered on Enceladus water-ice jets, which replenish Saturn’s outermost ring with tiny ice grains and vapor. Analysis of the data from Cassini’s cosmic-dust detector concluded that only the presence of liquid water could account for the dissolution of the significant amounts of minerals necessary to produce the levels of salt detected in the ring. Frank Postberg, Cassini scientist for the cosmic-dust analyzer at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, explained that the grains include table salt and carbonates, like soda, in concentrations that match the predicted composition of an Enceladus ocean. He added that, if the liquid source is indeed an ocean, its presence, coupled with the heat measured near the moon’s south pole and the organic compounds found in the plumes, creates an environment suitable for the formation of life precursors.(NASA, “Salt Finding from NASA’s Cassini Hints at Ocean Within Saturn Moon,” news release 09-147, 24 June 2009, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/jun/HQ_09-147_Cassini_Enceladus_Salts.html (accessed 22 July 2011).)
The People’s Republic of China’s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense announced that Chang’e-1, China’s first lunar probe, had impacted the Moon at 4:13 p.m., Beijing time, successfully ending its 16-month mission. China had launched Chang’e-1 on 24 October 2007, on a mission to produce the first full map of the Moon’s surface. Chang’e-1 had accomplished the mission using stereo radar. The planned lunar impact, the culmination of the first phase of China’s three-stage Moon mission, would enable China to acquire experience that would help it land the second Chinese lunar probe, scheduled to launch in 2012.(Xinhua News Agency,, “China’s Lunar Probe Chang’e-1 Impacts Moon,” 2 March 2009; BBC News, “Chinese Probe Crashes into Moon,” 2 March 2009.)
NASA announced that three teams out of a field of 19 had claimed a total of US$750,000 in prizes at the 2009 Regolith Excavation Challenge on 18 October, marking the first time that any team in the competition’s three-year history had qualified for a cash prize. NASA required the competitors to use mobile, robotic digging machines to excavate a minimum of 330 pounds (149 kilograms) of regolith, or simulated Moon dirt, and to deposit the regolith into a container within 30 minutes. NASA had further stipulated that the vehicles must contain their own power source and weigh no more than 176 pounds (79.8 kilograms). Paul’s Robotics of Worcester, Massachusetts, had earned first place and US$500,000, for excavating 1,103 pounds (500 kilograms) of regolith within the allotted time of 30 minutes. Three-time returning competitor Terra Engineering of Gardena, California, had won second place and US$150,000 for excavating 595 pounds (270 kilograms) of regolith, and first-time competitor Team Braundo of Rancho Palos Verde, California, had earned third place and US$100,000 for excavating 580 pounds (263 kilograms) of regolith.(NASA, “Teams Win at NASA National Lunar Robotics Competition,” news release 09-245, 19 October 2009, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/oct/HQ_09-245_Regolith_winners.html (accessed 30 September 2011).)
JAXA’s first lunar probe Kaguya (Selene) successfully completed its approximately one-year- and-a-half mission when it made a controlled crash landing on the Moon. JAXA had launched Kaguya in September 2007. Kaguya had conducted nominal operations for approximately 10 months, performing an extended operational phase for an additional seven months. Before undergoing the controlled crash landing, Kaguya had orbited the Moon, to map the lunar surface and to study the Moon’s mineral distribution and gravity levels.(Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, “Kaguya (Selene) Slam Crashed to the Moon,” JAXA press release 11 June 2009, http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2009/06/20090611_kaguya_e.html (accessed 27 July 2011); Shino Yuasa, “Japan’s First Lunar Probe Ends Mission,” Associated Press, 11 June 2009.)
ISRO ended its US$82 million Chandrayaan mission after failing to restore communication with the craft. ISRO had lost contact with Chandrayaan 1 on 29 August. Chandrayaan 1, known as Moon Craft, had launched on 22 October 2008 on a mission to map the lunar terrain in preparation for a future mission that would land a rover on the Moon’s surface. ISRO had designed the craft to orbit the Moon for two years, at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles). Chandrayaan 1 carried 11 payloads, including an Indian-designed terrain-mapping camera, ESA mapping instruments, radiation-measuring equipment belonging to the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, and two NASA devices designed to assess mineral composition and to look for ice deposits. ISRO Chief Madhavan Nair reportedly told the state-run broadcaster Doordarshan that a malfunction in computers on board the craft had led to the failure in communications. Nair also stated that a committee of scientists would investigate the incident.(Ed Johnson, “India Ends Lunar Mission After Losing Probe Signal,” Bloomberg News, 31 August 2009; Associated Press, “Indian Moon Orbiter Loses Contact,” 29 August 2009.)
