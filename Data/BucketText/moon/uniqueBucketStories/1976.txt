The Apollo lunar scientific experiment package (ALSEP) left on the moon’s surface during Apollo 14, reported dead [see 18 Jan.] when transmission ceased last month from unknown causes, came to life just as unexpectedly 19 Feb. with transmitter, receiver, and experiments functioning very well. One experiment—the charged-particle lunar environment experiment—had previously been unable to perform during lunar daylight because temperature variations had degraded its power supply; since the revival, the experiment had been sending good data during lunar daylight. JSC scientists and Bendix engineers who designed the ALSEPs had no idea what happened to the Apollo 14 station, one of 5 transmitting data from the moon; one possibility cited was a relay in the power system that had stuck and then became unstuck. Estimated remaining life of the Apollo 14 station was once again 2 to 3 yr; all the stations had performed well, with the oldest—from Apollo 12—nearing its 7th year. ALSEP experiments were still providing data on conditions inside the moon and on moonquakes; scientists were still hoping for seismic signals from a large meteor impact that would identify the moon’s core.
