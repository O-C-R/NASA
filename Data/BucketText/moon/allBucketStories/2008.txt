After allowing some of the water to evaporate from a sample measuring 3 cubic centimeters (0.18 cubic inches), scientists had used Phoenix’s whirling rasp to grate the soil into the TEGA. The TEGA had analyzed the vapor that the sample released when heated to the melting point of 32°F (0°C), confirming the presence of water in the soil. The analyzer had also examined the sample while it was heating to 1,800°F (982.22°C). Although the Mars Odyssey spacecraft had first sighted ice on the planet’s surface while orbiting Mars in 2002, Phoenix’s test was the first chemical analysis to prove the existence of water ice on Mars. NASA announced that it planned to add 90 days to Phoenix’s original mission, extending the mission through 30 September 2008.(Kenneth Chang, “Test of Mars Soil Sample Confirms Presence of Ice,” New York Times, 1 August 2008; NASA, “NASA Spacecraft Confirms Martian Water, Mission Extended,” news release 08-195, 31 July 2008, http://www. nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jul/HQ_08_195_Phoenix_water.html (accessed 18 May 2008); David Perlman, “NASA Craft Probes Ice on Mars,” San Francisco Chronicle, 1 August 2008.)
Robert C. Seamans Jr., who had served as NASA Deputy Administrator during the Apollo era, died of heart failure at age 89. Seamans had begun his career as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1940s. In 1960 he had accepted a position with NASA as Associate Administrator, and, from 1965 to 1968, he had served as Deputy Administrator. During his tenure, NASA had worked to achieve President John F. Kennedy’s goal of landing a man on the Moon, and Seamans had been instrumental to the success of that mission. In 1968 Seamans had left his position at NASA to return to MIT, although he remained a consultant to NASA’s Administrator. Later that year, he had assisted in making the controversial decision to send Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon, a move that had laid the groundwork for the lunar landing. Seamans had served as Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from 1969 to 1973. In 1974 he had been appointed Administrator of the Energy, Research and Development Administration, a predecessor agency to the Department of Energy. In 1977 Seamans had accepted a position as Dean of the School of Engineering at MIT, where he had continued to teach aeronautics classes even after his formal retirement in 1984.(Peter Schworm, “Robert Seamans; Helped Lead NASA During Apollo Missions,” Boston Globe, 30 June 2008. 79 NASA, “Astronaut James Reilly Leaves NASA,” news release 08-162, 30 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/ hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08163_Seamans_statement.html (accessed 21 April 2011).)
A team of scientists led by Robert H. Brown of the University of Arizona, Tucson, announced in the journal Nature that NASA’s Cassini spacecraft had gathered evidence that Saturn’s moon Titan has at least one lake of liquid hydrocarbons. The discovery made Titan the only known celestial body, besides Earth, to have liquid on its surface. Data from previous fly-bys had shown that Titan has several features that appear to be lakes, but scientists had been unsure whether these bodies contained liquid or solid material. Then, in a December 2007 fly-by, Cassini had used its visual and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIMS) to gather data on a lake in the southern polar region named Ontario Lacus. The lake covers an area of 7,800 square miles (20,201.91 square kilometers) and is composed of a liquid ethane solution, along with methane, other hydrocarbons, and nitrogen. At the surface temperature of Titan, which is -300°F (- 184.44°C), these compounds exist both as liquid and as gas. Cassini’s data showed that the lake had experienced some evaporation at summer temperatures. Titan has a methane-based hydrological cycle; therefore, the scientists believed that a precipitation of liquid methane fills Ontario Lacus.(Jeanna Bryner, “Giant Lake Confirmed on Saturn’s Moon Titan,” Space.com, 31 July 2008, http://www.space. com/5673-giant-lake-confirmed-saturn-moon-titan.html (accessed 18 May 2011); NASA, “NASA Confirms Liquid Lake in Saturn Moon,” new release 08-193, 30 July 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jul/HQ_08_193_ Titan_lake.html (accessed 18 May 2011); see also R.

Warner K. Dahm, the last of Wernher von Braun’s German rocket team to retire from NASA, died at age 90 in Huntsville, Alabama. A German aerodynamics expert, Dahm had joined von Braun’s program during World War II and had later come to the United States with his colleagues to assist in developing American rocketry. He had worked at NASA first as a member of the team for Operation Paperclip in Texas and later at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Over the years, Dahm had lent his expertise to the design of the V-2 and Wasserfall anti-aircraft rockets, the Redstone rocket, the Jupiter ballistic missile, Saturn 1, Saturn 1B, the Saturn-5 rocket that flew America’s first astronauts to the Moon, Skylab, and the Space Shuttle Transportation System. In 2006, at the age of 89, he had retired from his position as Chief 5 Aerodynamicist at Marshall. Dahm had received NASA’s Exceptional Service Medal in 2003.
Robert Jastrow, one of NASA’s founding administrators and a popular commentator on NASA’s missions to the Moon, died from complications of pneumonia at the age of 82. Jastrow had spent his early career at Yale and at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. When NASA formed in 1958, Jastrow had become Chief of the Theoretical Division. In 1961 he had become Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), where he had worked on the Pioneer, Voyager, and Galileo probes. He had held positions at Columbia University and Dartmouth College before becoming chair of the Mount Wilson Institute in 1992. Jastrow had cofounded the George C. Marshall Institute in 1984 and still held the position of Chair Emeritus of the Institute at the time of his death. The public knew Jastrow well for his ability to explain science and space exploration in easily understood terms. Besides being a frequent guest on network television, he was the author of the 1967 best seller Red Giants and White Dwarfs and of the controversial How To Make Nuclear Weapons Obsolete—the 1985 defense of President Ronald W. Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative. Over the course of his career, Jastrow had received the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, the Arthur S. Fleming Award for Outstanding Service to the U.S. Government, and the Columbia University Medal of Excellence.(John Schwartz, “Robert Jastrow, Who Made Space Understandable, Dies at 82,” New York Times, 12 February 2008; Thomas H. Maugh II, “Robert Jastrow, 82; Astrophysicist Helped Shape NASA’s Space Exploration,” Los Angeles Times, 17 February 2008.)
NASA’s Lunar Science Institute, along with nine other international space agencies, signed a statement of intent to consider participating in the International Lunar Network (ILN), a cooperative effort to install mobile science stations on the Moon. The stations would replace the technology that NASA astronauts had placed on the lunar surface during the Apollo program. The signing of the statement took place in the course of a four-day NASA Lunar Science Conference at NASA’s ARC. The conference had gathered approximately 500 scientists, from Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States, to discuss the future of lunar exploration. Although scientists from the participating agencies planned to refine the ILN concept, the agencies expected to make initial decisions regarding communications standards and potential landing sites, and to select a set of scientifically equivalent core instruments to perform specific measurements.(NASA, “NASA Hosts International Meeting for Lunar Science Discussions,” new release 08-190, 29 July 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jul/HQ_08190_NASA_hosts_ILN.html (accessed 18 May 2011); David Perlman, “Scientists Swap Moon, Mars Exploration Plans,” San Francisco Chronicle, 22 July 2008.)
John S. Bull, a member of NASA’s original class of 19 astronauts, died at the age of 73. He had never flown in space. Bull had begun to train as an astronaut in 1966. In early 1967, NASA had chosen him as a member of the crew of LTA-8, a thermal-vacuum test of the Moon lander. However, sinus problems had prevented him from participating in the mission. In November 1967, NASA had selected Bull for the support crew of the Apollo 8 mission. However, he had resigned from the astronaut corps in July 1968 because he had a rare pulmonary disorder. Bull had obtained a Master’s degree and a PhD from Stanford University, returning to NASA in 1973. He had performed flight-test research at NASA’s ARC until 1986 and had then managed NASA- wide research programs in autonomous systems technology for space applications, until his retirement in 1989.(Collectspace.com, “John S. Bull, Former NASA Astronaut, Dies,” 14 August 2008, http://www.collectspace.com/ news/news-081408a.html (accessed 15 July 2011).)
The X Prize Foundation announced that four new teams had registered for the Google Lunar X Prize competition, bringing the total number of registered teams to 14. The Google Lunar X Prize race would grant US$20 million to the first team to build a privately funded spacecraft that would land on the Moon, move 500 meters, and transmit data, images, and video back to Earth. The deadline for receiving the full purse had been set for 31 December 2012; after that date, the X Prize Foundation would reduce the value of the grand prize. The X Prize Foundation had also offered a second prize and bonus prizes. One of the new teams that had joined the competition was a mystery team. The contest rules permitted a team to keep its identity a secret until 20 July 2009. Also joining the race were the contest’s first Asian team, Team Advaeros of Malaysia, led by Hanidy Yusof; the Juxtopia Urban Robotics Brilliant Application National (JURBAN) team, led by Jayfus T. Doswell and composed of both professional and student engineers; and Team STELLAR, led by Richard D. Dell and based in North Carolina.(Space.com, “Four New Teams Join Moon Rover Race,” 22 May 2008, http://www.space.com/5383-teams-join- moon-rover-race.html (accessed 29 March 2011).)
The House Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics conducted a review of the status of NASA’s space exploration initiative. The Subcommittee focused on the effect that the FY 2009 budget request would have on the ability of NASA’s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) to implement the George W. Bush administration’s 2004 Vision for Space Exploration (VSE). Among other things, the VSE had mandated that NASA return to the Moon by 2020. The ESMD’s Constellation Program was developing vehicles, such as the Orion CEV and the Ares-I crew launch vehicle (CLV), to implement the VSE. NASA had proposed that the FY 2009 budget request include US$3.5 billion in funding for the ESMD. During the hearing, Subcommittee Chair Mark E. Udall (D-CO) expressed concern that space exploration projects were underfunded and might become a drain on NASA’s resources. Furthermore, Cristina T. Chaplain of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) testified that, because of the complexity of the Constellation Program, GAO was concerned about the reliability of cost estimates for the programs. However, Richard J. Gilbrech, Associate Administrator of the ESMD, asked Congress to support the FY 2009 budget request, asserting that it would provide NASA with a stable source of funding.(U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, “Subcommittee Examines Status of NASA’s Human Exploration Initiative,” press release, 3 April 2008, http://gop.science.house.gov/PressRoom/Item.aspx?ID=94 (accessed 19 January 2011); U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, “Subcommittee Examines Progress and Plans of NASA’s Exploration Initiative,” press release, 3 April 2008, http://sciencedems.house.gov/press/ PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=2142 (accessed 15 March 2011); U.S. Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, “NASA’ s Exploration Initiative: Status and Issues,” 110th Cong., 2nd sess., 3 April 2008, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/ pkg/CHRG-110hhrg41471/pdf/CHRG-110hhrg41471.pdf (accessed 4 March 2011).)
The X Prize Foundation and Google announced the names of the first 10 teams to qualify to compete in the Google Lunar X Prize competition, which would award US$20 million to the first team to send a rover to the Moon. The winning team must build a rover that would land on the Moon, transmit a data signal back to Earth, travel at least 500 meters (1,640 feet), and then transmit another data signal. The X Prize Foundation would also give US$5 million to the second team to accomplish this goal, as well as offering additional prizes for other lunar achievements, such as the detection of lunar ice. The teams qualifying for the competition were Aeronautics and Cosmonautics Romanian Association (ARCA) of Romania; Astrobotic Technology of the United States; Chandah of the United States; FREDNET, a multinational team; LunaTrex of the Unites States; Micro-Space of the United States; Odyssey Moon of the Isle of Man; Quantum3 of the 22 United States; Southern California Selene Group of the United States; and Team Italia of Italy. The U.S. Navy cruiser Lake Erie fired a missile interceptor that struck down a disabled American spy satellite over the Pacific Ocean. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) managed the 5,000-pound (2,268-kilgram) satellite, which was orbiting 130 miles (209 kilometers) above Earth’s surface, at over 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour), when it was hit at 22:30 (EST). The satellite had been inoperative since shortly after its launch in December 2006. Officials had been concerned that its fuel tank, filled with 1,000 pounds (454 kilograms) of toxic hydrazine, could pose a risk to humans if the satellite fell in a populated area. A heat-seeking missile interceptor, retooled to track the frozen satellite, had accomplished the strike. Military officials had timed the strike to occur after Space Shuttle Atlantis’s 20 February 2008 return to Earth, but before 1 March 2008, when the satellite’s fall into the upper atmosphere would disrupt its orbit, making it more difficult to hit. Officials stated that they believed that the impact had been strong enough to incinerate the fuel tank, although they would not know for 24 hours whether that had actually occurred.(Thom Shanker, “Missile Strikes a Spy Satellite Falling From Its Orbit,” New York Times, 21 February 2008. 24 NASA, “NASA Selects New Deputy Associate Administrator of Strategic Partnerships and Space Program Manager,” news release 08-065, 22 February 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/feb/ HQ_08065_ New_Shuttle_Manage.html (accessed 28 December 2010).)
The X Prize Foundation announced that two new teams had entered the Google Lunar X Prize. Euroluna was a European team primarily made up of members from Denmark, Italy, and Switzerland. Led by Palle Haastrup, the team planned to launch a small rover, which would have no redundant systems, so that it could maintain a low weight. Markus Bindhammer led the team Selene, based in China. The team planned to launch its Selena-1 lander in its Lunar Rocket Car– 1 (LuRoCa-1) rover. Fourteen other teams had signed up for the competition, which featured a US$20 million grand prize, a US$5 million second prize, and US$5 million in bonus prizes. The grand prize would go to the team that could land a spacecraft on the Moon, move it 500 meters (1,640.42 feet), and transmit images back to Earth.(Tariq Malik, “New Teams Join $30 Million Moon Rover Contest,” Space.com, 16 December 2008, http://www. space.com/6232-teams-join-30-million-moon-rover-contest.html (accessed 25 August 2011).)
NASA announced that it had awarded a contract to the Houston-based firm Oceaneering International for the design, development, and production of a new line of spacesuits for the Constellation Program. Under the new contract, NASA would order 109 spacesuits for astronauts to use on voyages to the ISS and, later, to the Moon. The cost-plus-award-fee contract included a basic performance period and two contract options. The basic performance period of the contract included the design, manufacture, and first flight of the suit components. Valued at US$183.8 million, the basic performance period would run from June 2008 to September 2014. Option 1, the development and testing of the components of a spacesuit for use on the Moon’s surface, had a value of US$302 million and would run from October 2010 through September 2018. Option 2, the production of the Orion suit, had a value of US$260 million and would run from October 2014 through September 2018. NASA also announced the subcontractors for the Constellation Program: Air-Lock of Milford, Connecticut; David Clark of Worcester, Massachusetts; Cimarron Software Services of Houston, Texas; Harris Corporation of Palm Bay, Florida; Honeywell International of Glendale, Arizona; Paragon Space Development of Tucson, Arizona; and United Space Alliance of Houston. Oceaneering International had competed for the contract against Explorations Systems and Technology, which was a joint venture of Hamilton Sundstrand and ILC Dover. Hamilton Sundstrand had been the primary contractor providing NASA’s spacesuits since the 1960s.(NASA, “NASA Awards Contract for Constellation Spacesuit for the Moon,” news release C08-037, 12 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_C08037_Constellation_Spacesuit.html (accessed 12 June 2011); Associated Press, “Oceaneering International Awarded Contract for New Spacesuit,” 12 June 2008.)
Chandrayaan 1, India’s first lunar satellite, launched at 00:52 (UT), aboard a PSLV-C11 rocket from Sriharikota, India. The 1.4-tonne (1,400-kilogram or 3,086.47-pound) spacecraft was on a two-year mission to map the lunar surface. It carried 11 scientific instruments: five instruments from India, three from ESA, two from NASA, and one from Bulgaria. NASA’s instruments were the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) and Mini Synthetic Aperture Radar (Mini-SAR). M3 was an imaging spectrometer that would create the first map of the Moon’s entire surface at high spatial and spectral resolution. Because the map would show the mineral content of the lunar surface, scientists could use it to understand the geological origin and development of the Moon and the terrestrial planets. Additionally, lunar astronauts could use the map to locate water or other resources. Mini-SAR, an imaging radar, would map the permanently shadowed polar regions, helping scientists learn about possible locations of water ice and the nature of objects that hit the Moon. NASA’s ground tracking station at the Johns Hopkins University APL would provide space-communications support to Chandrayaan 1.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 660, 1 November 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx660.html (accessed 4 August 2011); NASA, “NASA Returns to the Moon with Instruments on Indian Spacecraft,” news release 08-263, 20 October 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/oct/HQ_08-263_NASA_on_Chandrayaan-1.html (accessed 8 August 2011).)
A team of scientists, led by Geraint H. Jones of the Millard Space Science Laboratory in London, announced in the journal Science that NASA’s Cassini spacecraft had gathered evidence of the presence of rings around Saturn’s moon Rhea. Cassini had flown close to Rhea in November 2005. Using a set of six instruments to take samples and measurements of Rhea’s atmosphere, Cassini had detected a decrease in the number of electrons on either side of the moon. The team believed that a ring of debris orbiting Rhea had absorbed the electrons—the first time scientists had detected the presence of a ring of debris around a moon. The researchers estimated that the particles comprising the ring ranged in size from pebbles to boulders. NASA’s JPL was managing the Cassini project, a joint mission of NASA, ESA, and the Italian space agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana—ASI).(NASA, “Saturn’s Moon Rhea Also May Have Rings,” news release 08-074, 6 March 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/ home/hqnews/2008/mar/HQ_08074_Rings_Around_Rhea.html (accessed 13 January 2011); Associated Press, “Saturn Moon Rhea May Have Rings,” 7 March 2008; G.

NASA’s Cassini spacecraft flew by Saturn’s moon Enceladus, photographing the ice jets that spew from gorges at the Enceladus’s south pole and taking measurements of them. The craft passed within 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) of the moon’s surface, traveling at 64,000 miles per hour (102,998.02 kilometers per hour), while snapping the highest-resolution images ever taken of the ice jets. The photographs revealed the features of the gorges known as “tiger stripes,” which are approximately 980 feet (298.70 meters) deep. Tiger stripes have V-shaped sides that are strewn with large chunks of ice and dusted with a fine material, apparently composed of snow-like ice particles. Scientists were interested in studying Enceladus’s ice jets because of the possibility that they might indicate the presence of liquid water beneath the moon’s surface.(Space.com, “Cassini Spots Icy Jet Sources on Saturn Moon,” 15 August 2008, http://www.space.com/5738- cassini-spots-icy-jet-sources-saturn-moon.html (accessed 25 July 2011); Kenneth Chang, “NASA Has Its Closest Look at Geysers on Saturn Moon,” New York Times, 16 August 2008.)
NASA announced that Assistant Administrator for External Relations Michael F. O’Brien had signed a joint statement of intent with Munki Lee, the Republic of Korea’s (South Korea’s) Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MEST) Director-General for Big Science. The statement of intent, signed in Seoul, was an agreement between NASA and MEST to conduct dialogues that would identify new cooperative endeavors related to aeronautics research, Earth science, human spaceflight, planetary science, and space exploration. The agencies expected that they might discuss topics for possible collaborative endeavors, such as planning exploration architecture, exchanging research analysis and data, and contributing hardware and scientific instruments to future missions. They might also consider involvement in the Global Exploration Strategy, a discussion between 14 space agencies to increase cooperation in space exploration; the International Lunar Network, an initiative to establish a robotic network on the Moon; and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group, an international effort to coordinate space exploration activities. NASA and MEST expected to prepare a report after 8 months of dialogue.

Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced that its lunar orbiter craft, Chandrayaan 1, had dropped a Moon Impact Probe to the lunar surface. The 64-pound ( probe, which measured 14.70 inches (37.34 centimeters) by 14.7 inches ( by 18.5 inches (46.99 centimeters), landed on the Moon at 10:01 (EST). The probe’s mission was to test soft-landing technologies and to observe the lunar surface. It carried a mass spectrometer to study the lunar atmosphere, a radar altimeter to measure the probe’s altitude, and a video imaging system to photograph the descent. Chandrayaan 1, a US$80 million mission, had launched on 22 October 2008, joining China, Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States as the only nations that had sent missions to the Moon.(Space.com, “India Slams Probe into the Moon,” 14 November 2008, http://www.space.com/6113-india-slams- probe-moon.html (accessed 25 August 2011); Associated Press, “India’s First Lunar Probe Lands on the Moon,” 15 November 2008.)
A team of researchers led by Ralph D. Lorenz of Johns Hopkins University’s APL announced in the journal Science that NASA’s Cassini spacecraft had discovered evidence of an underground ocean composed of water and ammonia on Saturn’s moon Titan. During 19 flybys made between October 2005 and May 2007, Cassini’s SAR had gathered images of the moon’s surface that showed that distinct features on Titan’s surface, such as lakes, canyons, and mountains, had shifted location over time by as much as 19 miles (31 kilometers). The scientists believed that this shifting had occurred because winds in Titan’s heavy atmosphere had moved the moon’s thin surface crust, which was separated from the moon’s core by an ocean, measuring 60−120 miles (97−193 kilometers) deep. Scientists had previously discovered evidence of underground oceans on other moons in Earth’s solar system. However, the researchers were particularly interested to discover the presence of liquid water on Titan, because that moon has many of the same organic compounds as Earth.(NASA, “Cassini Spacecraft Finds Ocean May Exist Beneath Titan’s Crust,” news release 08-085, 20 March 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/mar/HQ_08085_cassini_ocean.html (accessed 2 February 2011); Charles Q.

NASA scientists released data that the Cassini spacecraft had collected on 12 March 2008, when it swooped through a geyser of water vapor erupting from the surface of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. The data revealed that the water vapor contained acetylene, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methane, and propane. The organic material composing Enceladus closely resembled that of a comet, a discovery that surprised scientists and raised questions regarding the formation and origin of Saturn’s moons. Cassini had also generated new heat maps, which showed significantly warmer temperatures on Enceladus than anticipated, particularly along the moon’s “tiger stripes”—the deep fissures at its south pole. Temperatures along the fissures had registered at -135°F (-93°C), which was 63°F (17°C) warmer than previously recorded temperatures in that area and 200°F (93°C) warmer than the temperatures of other areas of the moon. Temperatures this warm raised the possibility that Enceladus could have subterranean liquid water.(NASA, “Cassini Tastes Organic Material at Saturn’s Geyser Moon,” news release 08-089, 26 March 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/mar/HQ_08089_Cassini_Enceladus_Flyby.html (accessed 13 January 2011); Dave Mosher, “Seeds of Life Found Near Saturn,” Space.com, 26 March 2008, http://www.space.com/5179- seeds-life-saturn.html (accessed 1 February 2011).)
NASA announced that it had exhibited a new robot rover that would be able to drill into the lunar surface to find water and oxygen-dense soil. The rover, Scarab, would not travel to the Moon itself. Instead, NASA had designed Scarab as a research rover, to give scientists an opportunity to study drilling technologies that they could use in the difficult environment of the Moon, noted for its continuous darkness, minimal gravity, and extremely abrasive and dense soil. The rover was a joint effort among many institutions. NASA’s ARC had built Scarab’s navigation system, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) had funded a camera; NASA’s GRC had been responsible for its power-management system; the Northern Centre for Advanced Technology had built its drill; and Carnegie Mellon University had overseen the rover’s design and testing. The Human Robotic Systems and In-Situ Resource Utilization projects at NASA’s JSC, part of the Exploration Technology Development Programs that LaRC managed, had collaborated on the project.(NASA, “NASA Demonstrates Robot Technology for Moon Exploration,” news release 08-067, 27 February 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/feb/HQ_08067_lunar_robot.html (accessed 28 December 2010); CBC News, “NASA Shows Off Rover Armed with Canadian-Made Drill,” 27 February 2008, http://www.cbc.ca/ technology/story/2008/02/27/tech-rover-drill.html (accessed 5 January 2011).)
NASA and ATK successfully test-fired a launch-abort motor for the Orion CEV at ATK’s facility in Promontory, Utah. The 5.50-second test was the first of its kind since the beginning of the Apollo Program and the first test ever of a motor with reverse-flow propulsion technology at such a scale. NASA had designed the launch-abort motor for use in case of an emergency on the launchpad or in the first 300,000 feet (91,440 meters) of ascent. If necessary, the motor could lift the crew module off the Ares-I rocket, using 500,000 pounds ( s) of thrust. The motor, which was more than 17 feet (5.18 meters) tall and 3 feet ( ) in diameter, featured a composite case and an exhaust turn-flow technology instead of a tower, a configuration that improved the motor’s weight and performance.(NASA, “NASA, ATK Successfully Test First Orion Launch Abort Motor,” news release 08-306, 20 November 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08-306_OrionLASmotor_Success.html (accessed 22 August 2011).)
Harrison “Jack” H. Schmitt, a scientist, former astronaut, and former U.S. Senator, announced that he was resigning as Chair of the NASA Advisory Council. The NASA Advisory Council, a panel of experts in various fields, advised the NASA Administrator on major policy. Since becoming Chair in November 2005, Schmitt had led the Advisory Council in submitting over 100 recommendations to the NASA Administrator. He had been the primary advocate behind a February 2007 workshop that produced 35 scientific recommendations related to NASA’s return to the Moon and had led the Advisory Council’s efforts to build relationships fostering the use of the ISS as a national laboratory. NASA named Kenneth M. Ford as the new Advisory Council Chair. Ford had served on the Exploration Committee of the Advisory Council since June 2007. He was the founder and Director of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition. Ford had developed and directed NASA’s Center of Excellence in Information Technology at NASA’s ARC. He had also served as both Director and Associate Director of NASA’s ARC. A recipient of NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal and the Robert S. Englemore Memorial Award, Ford had served on the U.S. Air Force Science Advisory Board and the National Science Board. He was also a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.(NASA, “Schmitt Completes NASA Advisory Council service; Ford Named Chairman,” news release 08-262, 16 October 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/oct/HQ_08-261_Scmitt_Leaves_NAC.html (accessed 8 August 2011).)
The People’s Republic of China’s Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense released the first photographs that China had captured of the Moon’s polar regions. The 2,350-pound (1,066-kilogram) Chang’e-1 lunar probe had taken the photographs. Chang’e-1 had been orbiting the Moon at an altitude of 200 kilometers (124 miles) since 7 November 2007. On 4 January 2008, Chang’e-1’s cameras had adjusted, enabling them to photograph areas of the Moon above 70° north or south latitude. China intended the probe to produce a three-dimensional lunar-surface survey and to provide data and images for use in other experiments.(Xinhua News Agency, “Chang’e-1 Captures Pictures of Moon’s Polar Areas,” 31 January 2008, http://news. xinhuanet.com/english/2008-01/31/content_7532773.htm (accessed 14 December 2010).)
