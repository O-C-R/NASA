The Soviet Union's Phobos 2 Mars observer spacecraft entered into Martian orbit after firing its braking engine. In addition to various instruments for remote observation of Mars, Phobos 2 carried a lander module to be deposited on Mar's moon Phobos in early April. Phobos 1 became inoperative in August 1988 after a flight command error disoriented the spacecraft and misdirected its solar power arrays. The schedule for Photos 2 was moved forward by several days because of electrical problems that might endanger the mission.

The discovery of seven dim galaxies in the "Bootes Void" challenges accepted theories of the structure of the universe, which is believed to consist of filaments or "bubbles" of matter surrounding less dense areas of relatively empty space. The Michigan astronomers said they planned to continue studying IRAS' infrared data in hopes of finding more dim galaxies. (W Post, Jan 16/89)
This date marked the twentieth anniversary of the first crewassisted landing on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin. Armstrong, Aldrin, and their crewmate, Michael Collins, commemorated the lunar landing with ceremonies at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC, and the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. During the Washington ceremony, attended by President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, the President proposed a long range program of humanassisted space exploration, including a permanently habitable base on the Moon and a crew expedition to Mars, but did not establish a specific timetable. The President cited Space Station Freedom as an important stepping stone toward missions to the Moon and Mars. Speaking at the National Air and Space Museum, Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to step on the lunar surface, said: "The Apollo program enjoyed a certain nobility of purposea program not to conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance. A program not to exploit, but to explore. A program not to take from others, but to give to all, to give new knowledge, to enlarge the human horizon."

Planetary scientists working with data from a Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune announced that the spacecraft had recorded wind speeds on the planet of up to 1,500 miles per hour. These wind speeds exceeded those observed on Saturn and were believed to be the highest in the solar system. The scientists also reported the discovery of at least two additional volcanic plumes on Neptune's moon, Triton. (AP, Dec 6/89; C Trib, Dec 6/89; NY Times, Dec 7/89)
In a severe setback for the Soviet Union's planetary exploration program, Soviet ground controllers lost stable radio contact with the untended Phobos 2 Mars probe, the Tass news agency reported. Phobos 2 stopped responding to ground control commands shortly after the craft was ordered to perform a delicate maneuver around the Mars moon Phobos. The maneuver was an initial step toward landing a probe on the Martian moon. During its transit toward Mars, Phobos 2 had experienced a failure of its main radio transmitter, forcing ground controllers to rely on a lowpower backup transmitter for all communications with the spacecraft. A companion spacecraft, Phobos 1, was also lost in September as a result of a ground control command error. The loss of communications with Phobos 2 was described by Western experts as having occurred at the "worst possible time" because few of the main mission objectives had yet been fulfilled.

Engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology returned from a visit to the Soviet Union with photographs of a crewassisted lunar landing vehicle that was to be used to land Soviet cosmonauts on the Moon in 1968. The westerners were given the first concrete evidence of a Soviet lunar landing program when they were shown components of a lunar lander at the Moscow Aviation Institute and were allowed to take photographs. Soviet officials confirmed that a race to land astronauts on the Moon had indeed occurred during the 1960s but that the Soviets had0*fallen behind the United States as a result of several launch failures of their N1 rocket. At the time of the successful lunar mission of Apollo 11, the Soviet Union had denied having a crewtended lunar landing program.

Planetary scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, announced that Voyager 2 photographs taken during the August encounter with Neptune had revealed the presence of an active volcano or geyser on Neptune's moon, Triton. The photographs revealed a dark plume nearly 5 miles high and 90 miles in length emanating from the surface of Triton. Triton became only the third object in the solar system known to have active eruptions from its surface.

Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collins participated in the first of several planned ceremonies at NASA facilities commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the first crewassisted lunar landing on July 20, 1969. Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins gathered at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, with a crowd of 6,000 NASA employees and their families to commemorate the launching of their Saturn V rocket from KSC on July 16, 1969. The ceremony included a playback of the final three minutes of the Apollo 11 countdown and statements by the former astronauts. Following the ceremony, the astronauts rode in a 20mile motorcade to Cocoa Beach, where they `"attended a luncheon in their honor. (UPI, Jul 16/89; USA Today, Jul (#17/89; B Sun, Jul 17/89)
Planetary scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) confirmed that the Voyager 2 space probe had discovered a third moon orbiting Neptune. The moon, temporarily designated 1989 N1, was estimated to be between 125 and 400 miles in diameter and to be in a nearcircular orbit 57,600 miles above Neptune's equator. Additionally, JPL announced that a pair of dark atmospheric bands had been discovered around Neptune's south pole. The scientists compared the 2,700 milewide belts to jet streams on Earth and to the belts seen around Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. The photograph showing the south pole bands also revealed evidence of comparable bands around Neptune's north pole. Voyager 2 was scheduled to fly to within 3,000 miles of Neptune on August 24. `"(NASA Release 89110, Jul 7/89; JPL Voyager Status Report, Jul (#7/89; AP, Jul 5/89; W Post, Jul 6/89; UPI, Jul 7/89;NY Times, Jul 8/89; W Post, Jul 8/89; LA Times, Jul 8/89; C Trib, Jul 8/89; P Inq, Jul 8/89)
Soviet and western planetary scientists announced results from the Phobos 2 mission to Mars and the moon Phobos. Despite the premature loss of spacecraft transmissions because of a computer error, scientists revealed that valuable data had been obtained from the twomonth period preceding the loss of communications. The new findings showed that Mars has no magnetic field of its own and that incoming solar particles impact directly with the planet's ionosphere. Researchers hypothesized that the direct interaction between the solar wind and Mars' upper atmosphere may have been responsible for the depletion of the planet's original atmosphere, as ionospheric particles were gradually electrified by the incoming solar particles. The observations suggested that Mars may have had an atmosphere comparable to Earth's during the first billion years after planet formation, and that conditions for the appearance of life may have prevailed during that time.

NASA named 18 astronauts to fly on future Space Shuttle missions, including the first AfricanAmerican woman and the first member of the Coast Guard to fly aboard the Shuttle. Dr. Mae Jemison, a physician, would become the first African American woman to fly in space. She was scheduled for the June 17, 1991, Spacelab mission aboard Discovery. (AP, Sep 9/89; UPI, Sep 29/89; USA Today, Oct 4/89; W Times, Oct 2/89) During September: The Soviet news magazine Izvestia published an article confirming that the Soviet Union had established a secret program in the 1960s to beat the United States in landing astronauts on the Moon. The Izvestia article claimed that the Soviet Union had secretly conducted a crewassisted lunar landing program from 1961 to 1969 comparable to the Apollo program and had developed a boosterknown as the N1comparable to the United States Saturn V. The Soviet lunar program was eventually abandoned after three attempts to launch the N1 failed; the United States successfully landed astronauts on the Moon in 1969.

The Tass News Agency reported that the Soviet Phobos 2 spacecraft had begun to transmit high quality closeup images of the Mars moon Phobos. Phobos 2 was expected to dispatch two small robot landers to the surface of Phobos. (FBISSov89034; LA Times, Feb 23/89; W Post, Feb 27/89)
Planetary scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced that Earthbased radar observations of Saturn's moon Titan had shown that it is not entirely covered by an ocean of liquid ethane. Radar echoes bounced from Titan between June 3 and0*6 showed the planet to have some dry land surfaces. Previous observations by the Voyager 2 space probe had shown that Titan had large oceans of liquid ethane and methane. (W Times, Jun 27/89)
