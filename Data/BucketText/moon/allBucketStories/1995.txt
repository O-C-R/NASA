President Bill Clinton presented astronaut Jim Lovell with the Space Medal of Honor, 25 years after he brought his crippled Apollo 13 spacecraft home. Actor Tom Hanks, who played Jim Lovell in the film �Apollo 13,� was present at the ceremony. The president said that the �extraordinary mission� was made even more vivid by the recent �Apollo 13� film.

According to an article in "Space News," the fate of a proposed U. S. mission to Pluto rested on the ability of NASA engineers to cut the program's cost below the existing $580 million estimate, presumably by incorporating high-risk technologies. U. S. scientists said time was running out for a Pluto mission. The planet is currently moving away from the sun. Scientists predicted that by 2025, Pluto's atmosphere will be completely frozen for centuries, precluding any effort to view the planet's surface. The existing plan called for launching two probes in 2001 that would map the surfaces of Pluto and its moon Charon before flying off into deep space. Cost-cutting measures being considered included reducing the amount of fuel for maneuvers at Pluto and the type of power source the craft will utilize for the mission. (Space News, Jan 23-29/95)
Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) found an oxygen atmosphere on Jupiter�s second moon, Europa. This detection was made by a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, both in Baltimore. They used data provided by HST�s Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) instrument from observations taken on June 2, 1994. Europa�s atmosphere is only one hundred billionth that of Earth. Europa, about the size of Earth�s moon, has an unusually smooth surface of solid water ice. The oxygen on Europa, whose surface temperature is -230 degrees Fahrenheit, is formed from purely non-biological processes. Water vapor and the gases oxygen and hydrogen are formed by the combination of sunlight and the bombardment of the dust and charged particles trapped in Jupiter�s intense magnetic field.

Remotely controlled tests by Ames Research Center of a modified Russian planetary rover, Marsokhod, are planned for February 13-18 in a volcanic area that resembles the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. The test site is in Kilauea Volcano�s summit caldera and southwest rift zone on the island of Hawaii. Marsokhod, which combines the Russian rover chassis with western avionics, is a sophisticated prototype of a long-distance rover. (NASA Release 95-14)
