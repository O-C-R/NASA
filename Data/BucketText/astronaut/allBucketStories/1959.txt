NASA announced training program for seven Project Mercury astronauts to provide them with technical knowledge and skills required to pilot tbe Nation�s manned orbital capsule.
Mercury astronauts completed basic and thecretlcal studies in i their training program and started practical engineering studies.
Two-stage Nike-Asp fired from Naval Missile Facility, Point Arguello, Hie first of 12 designed to record radiation 150 miles up and also the first ballistic missile fired from this new facility. During July: Project Mercury astronauts completed disorientation flights on three-axis space-flight simulator, tbe MASTIF (Multiple Axis Space Test Inertia Facility), at NASA Lewis Research Center.
Duijng severe geomagnetic storm, two Geiger tubes on EXPLORER YII found anomalies In tbe outer radiation zone at about 1,000-km altitude, which appeared to be correlated in space and time with optical emissions from the atmosphere below. Very Intense narrow zones of radiation were detected over a visible aurora during one orbit graph, and observing water vapor in the atmosphere of the planet Venus. During November: Prototype Goodrich full-pressure Mercury astronaut suits (modified Navy Mark IV) were delivered to NASA. Navy Air Crew Equipment Laboratory (NACEL) of Philadelphia fitted suits and indoctrinated tbe astronauts on their use.
Seven astronauts were selected for Project Mercury after a series of the most rigorous physical and mental tests ever given to U.S. test pilots. Chosen from a field of 110 candidates,� tbe finalists were all qualified test pilots: Cupts. Leroy Q. Cooper, Jr., Virgil I. �Grissom, and Douald K. Slayton, (USAF); Lt. Malcolm S. Carpeuter, Lt. Comdr. Alan B. Shepard, Jr., and Lt. Comdr. Waiter M. Schirra, Jr. (USN) ; and Lt. Col. John H. Glenn (USMC).
One hundred ten candidates were selected by NASA in the first screening for Project Mercury astronauts from Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps test-pilot echools.
