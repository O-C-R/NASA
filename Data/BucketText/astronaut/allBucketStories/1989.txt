Space Shuttle astronaut David S. Griggs was killed while off duty when a single engine propeller plane he was flying crashed near a private airstrip in Arkansas. Griggs had been performing aerobatic maneuvers in a vintage ST6 training plane when the craft struck the ground, killing the astronaut instantly. Griggs was a mission specialist aboard an April 1985 flight of the Space Shuttle Discovery and had been designated pilot for Discovery mission STS33 in November.

President George Bush announced the selection of Rear Admiral Richard H. Truly, a former astronaut and head of the Space Shuttle program, to succeed Dr. James C. Fletcher as NASA Administrator. The White House also announced that J.R. Thompson, Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Huntsville, Alabama, would be appointed NASA Deputy Administrator. Truly, a veteran of two Shuttle flights, was named to head the Shuttle program by Administrator Fletcher following the 1986 Challenger0*accident. Truly was credited with helping to restore safety and reliability to Shuttlerelated activities.

Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collins participated in the first of several planned ceremonies at NASA facilities commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the first crewassisted lunar landing on July 20, 1969. Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins gathered at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, with a crowd of 6,000 NASA employees and their families to commemorate the launching of their Saturn V rocket from KSC on July 16, 1969. The ceremony included a playback of the final three minutes of the Apollo 11 countdown and statements by the former astronauts. Following the ceremony, the astronauts rode in a 20mile motorcade to Cocoa Beach, where they `"attended a luncheon in their honor. (UPI, Jul 16/89; USA Today, Jul (#17/89; B Sun, Jul 17/89)
Great Britain and the Soviet Union signed an agreement to send a British astronaut to the Mir Space Station aboard a Soviet crew rotation flight in 1991. (USA Today, Jun 30/89; W Times, Jun 30/89; LA Times, Jun 30/89)
Engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology returned from a visit to the Soviet Union with photographs of a crewassisted lunar landing vehicle that was to be used to land Soviet cosmonauts on the Moon in 1968. The westerners were given the first concrete evidence of a Soviet lunar landing program when they were shown components of a lunar lander at the Moscow Aviation Institute and were allowed to take photographs. Soviet officials confirmed that a race to land astronauts on the Moon had indeed occurred during the 1960s but that the Soviets had0*fallen behind the United States as a result of several launch failures of their N1 rocket. At the time of the successful lunar mission of Apollo 11, the Soviet Union had denied having a crewtended lunar landing program.

NASA named 18 astronauts to fly on future Space Shuttle missions, including the first AfricanAmerican woman and the first member of the Coast Guard to fly aboard the Shuttle. Dr. Mae Jemison, a physician, would become the first African American woman to fly in space. She was scheduled for the June 17, 1991, Spacelab mission aboard Discovery. (AP, Sep 9/89; UPI, Sep 29/89; USA Today, Oct 4/89; W Times, Oct 2/89) During September: The Soviet news magazine Izvestia published an article confirming that the Soviet Union had established a secret program in the 1960s to beat the United States in landing astronauts on the Moon. The Izvestia article claimed that the Soviet Union had secretly conducted a crewassisted lunar landing program from 1961 to 1969 comparable to the Apollo program and had developed a boosterknown as the N1comparable to the United States Saturn V. The Soviet lunar program was eventually abandoned after three attempts to launch the N1 failed; the United States successfully landed astronauts on the Moon in 1969.

NASA scientists reported that a group of eight newly fertilized chicken embryos carried aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS28 had failed to hatch upon returning to Earth, raising questions about the viability of animal reproduction in zero gravity. A group of 16 eggs fertilized nine days before launch were all successfully hatched. Of a third group of eight eggs scheduled to hatch Saturday, only a few embryos remained viable. Discovery astronaut James Bagian speculated that the results may indicate that gravity plays a previously unknown critical role during the process of cell differentiation. Bagian suggested that, should the experiment demonstrate a relationship between gravity and embryogenesis, the results would have "great0*implications" for future longduration space missions.

This date marked the twentieth anniversary of the first crewassisted landing on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin. Armstrong, Aldrin, and their crewmate, Michael Collins, commemorated the lunar landing with ceremonies at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC, and the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. During the Washington ceremony, attended by President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, the President proposed a long range program of humanassisted space exploration, including a permanently habitable base on the Moon and a crew expedition to Mars, but did not establish a specific timetable. The President cited Space Station Freedom as an important stepping stone toward missions to the Moon and Mars. Speaking at the National Air and Space Museum, Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to step on the lunar surface, said: "The Apollo program enjoyed a certain nobility of purposea program not to conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance. A program not to exploit, but to explore. A program not to take from others, but to give to all, to give new knowledge, to enlarge the human horizon."

Two Soviet astronauts were successfully launched aboard a Soyuz TM8 capsule for a rendezvous with the Mir Space Station. The Soyuz TM8 capsule was launched aboard a Proton launch vehicle emblazoned with several commercial advertisements. Cosmonauts Alexander S. Viktorenko and Alexander A. Serebrov were scheduled to reoccupy the Mir station during a sixmonth tour and supervise the attachment of two new modules to the facility. Mir had been left unoccupied since April 27 because of funding constraints and delays in manufacturing of the new modules.

NASA announced that Martin Marietta Corporation of Bethesda, Maryland, had won a $297 million contract to develop the Flight Telerobotic Servicer (FTS), a space robot that would help construct and maintain the Space Station Freedom. Development of the robot was expected to take nine years and would include flight testing of a prototype aboard the Space Shuttle. Once deployed during an early Space Station construction mission, the mobile robot would be controlled remotely by astronauts from within the station, thereby minimizing the amount of "spacewalk" activity that astronauts would need to perform.

The United States and West Germany signed an agreement to send two German astronauts and German scientific payloads on a future Space Shuttle mission. The German astronauts would fly aboard a 1992 Spacelab mission that would test materials processing techniques. Two Germans and a Dutch astronaut flew aboard a Shuttle Spacelab mission in November 1985. (NASA Release 89113, Jul 10/89; AP, Nov 10/89; UPI, Nov 10/89; P Inq, Jul 12/89)

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that a NASA T38 jet trainer aircraft being flown by a Space Shuttle astronaut had experienced a near collision with a Pan American World Airways widebody jet about 30 miles West of Washington, DC. The pilots of the Airbus A310 jetliner reported the two planes had come within 500 feet of each other while on perpendicular flight paths. The T38 was flown by Navy Captain David M. Walker, Commander of the recently completed Space Shuttle mission STS28. The near collision occurred when Walker's aircraft strayed below its assigned flight elevation.
