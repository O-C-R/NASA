NASA announced delivery of its "restructuring" report to Congress, redesigning Space Station Freedom. William B. Lenoir, Associate Administrator for Space Flight, stated that NASA cut costs (by $8.9 million through 1999), simplified the design, and reduced the complexity of the project in accordance with Congress's directions and the Augustine Commission's recommendations. Six Shuttle flights would be needed to achieve the human-tended phase when astronauts, brought by the Space Shuttle, work for two-week periods. A permanently manned configuration would be achieved in fiscal year 2000, consisting of the US laboratory and habitat, and European and Japanese laboratories; the Canadian Mobile Servicing System; accommodations for a live-in crew of four; and three sets of solar arrays providing 65 kilowatts of electric power. Before permanent occupancy, an Assured Crew Return Vehicle must be available to evacuate crew in emergency; this phase requires 17 Shuttle flights. Various changes in ground facilities were also planned, scaling back some plans and resulting in some layoffs by contractors and subcontractors.

The press cited concern over "millions of pieces of trash zooming around in space" and the fear that they might hit the Hubbell Space Telescope or some orbiting astronauts. The concern caused work on new debris-monitoring devices and a system to warn astronauts of impending collisions with space junk so they could take evasive action. The U.S. Space Command's space surveillance network already kept track of about 6,700 pieces of larger litter at least four inches in diameter that might damage a Space Station. (AP, May 10/91; W Times, May 24/91)
The press reported that NASA was considering having two astronauts engage in a spacewalk to fix a cargo-door seal of Columbia that could prevent a safe return to Earth. The seal apparently shook loose during launch. It was later reported that NASA ground personnel determined the seal posed no re-entry problems so no spacewalk was needed. This allowed the astronauts more time to pursue their scientific experiments and medical research.

AP reported that statistically it was inevitable that astronauts would be obliged to make detours to avoid space junk. It happened twice within the previous three months, most recently with Atlantis a week and a half earlier, when it had to dodge 3,200 pounds of rocket debris. Under mission rules adopted after the Challenger explosion in 1986, astronauts must distance themselves from orbiting objects if they are expected to pass within a security zone that is 3.1 miles long, 1.2 miles wide, and 1.2 miles deep. NASA estimated there was one chance in 100,000 that a detectable object would collide with a spacecraft once inside that zone. (AP, Dec 9/91; NY Times, Dec 10/91)
An article emphasized the problems of the Soviet space program arising from economic and political causes. The Space Shuttle unveiled two years previously had not yet carried astronauts into space. The 100-foot long Mir Space Station underwent repeated cuts and in 1988 the "permanent" Space Station was left empty for four months; recently, three-man crews were reduced to two. Military rocket launchings continue but space program funds were cut 10 percent two years in a row. As a result, the reusable Shuttle Buran, which was to rendezvous with Salyut 7 and bring it back to earth, was unable to do so. Soviet efforts to fund the space program through foreign sales proved disappointing. (NY Times, Jan 8/91)
Chase Manhattan Bank granted $64 million five-year financing to Spacehab Inc. Spacehab was building a large pressurized chamber to fit into the storage bay of the Space Shuttle, giving the astronauts or technicians more room to run experiments.

NASA scientists connected with the Hubble Space Telescope correction project were quoted with reference to the amount of work to be done. The Hubble science team, subject to top-level NASA approval, was to build a second generation Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WFPC) with only four instead of eight of the powerful electronic light detectors known as charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The proposed change took account of tight money and time pressures but meant that the photographic operation might take 10 to 20 percent longer, according to Ed Weiler, NASA's chief Hubble scientist. The extent of repairs to be made would be decided by the end of 1991 but probably would involve Shuttle astronauts making three or four spacewalks of at least six hours each.

The media covered the final countdown preparations of the astronauts for the scheduled launch of Atlantis on July 24. Mission managers were satisfied with the completion of all necessary repairs. Then a storm on July 23 threatened to delay the blastoff, followed by the discovery early the morning of July 24 of trouble with a critical main engine computer. The discovery forced launch cancellation and postponement of the flight by at least one week to install a new unit. UPI reported on repair efforts and attempts to discover the source of the problem.

The Synthesis Group, a White House study group, planned to recommend US development of nuclear-propelled rockets to send manned expeditions to Mars, according to Aviation Week and Space Tehcnology. NASA established the group, chaired by retired Air Force General Thomas P. Stafford, an Apollo astronaut, to gather innovative ideas for lunar and Mars exploration. (AP, Mar 15/91;
The media reported that a British woman, Helen Sharman, went into space in a Soyuz TM-12 rocket with two Soviet astronauts, destined for Space Station Mir. The astronauts were to remain on Mir to do repairs while Sharman was to return with the two Soviet astronauts now on Mir.

According to the media, the Columbia astronauts were ahead of schedule on their experiments after spending 16- to 18-hour days working and planned to ease off and enjoy space more. On June 12 and 13, the press reported the continuing scientific experiments of the astronauts, culminating in efforts to fix two malfunctioning freezers in order to preserve experiment samples prior to final preparations for a landing on June 14.

The Synthesis Group, an advisory panel headed by former astronaut Thomas P. Stafford, outlined ways to create a lunar base and make the 35-million-mile trip to Mars. The group's report was expected in May, and John E. Pike, space policy expert for the Federation of American Scientists, said it was expected to recommend that the best method for the flight would be a nuclear reactor-powered rocket. Nuclear power would cut the time of the trip in half from the 450-500 days needed using conventional chemical rockets. It would require convincing the public of the safety and desirability of such nuclear power, which to date has been used only to produce electrical power for long, unoccupied trips such as that of Voyager that photographed the outer planets.

NASA announced that astronaut John M. Lounge would leave NASA June 21 to become Director of Houston Operations for Spacehab, Inc., which is providing a pressurized module for future space flights. (NASA Release 91-86)
The Discovery astronauts held a press conference at which they answered questions about their flight. They indicated it was easy to avoid the Soviet rocket chunk but that space debris could be a major threat to future crews. The amount of haze in the atmosphere from Mount Pinatubo or other sources, particularly struck astronauts who participated in earlier flights and aroused concern for the environment.

Tass announced that the first British astronaut and two Soviet cosmonauts had returned safely from Mir Space Station, landing on the steppes of Kazakhstan. Soviet space officials considered British participation valuable in terms of Soviet-British cooperation, although commercially the mission failed to gain British sponsorship. (UPI, May 27/91)
NASA indicated that the Shuttle Atlantis had landed 200 yards short of its lakebed runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The reason was that astronauts were unaware of the wind shift, of which ground controllers did not inform them because they thought the information was not needed. Measures have been taken to prevent similar incidents in the future by installing more efficient brakes and a drag chute to help slow the aircraft after touchdown. (O Sen Star, Apr 23/91)
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Mae Jemison, the first black female astronaut, who was scheduled to be a member of the crew of Endeavour in August 1992, had received an honorary doctor of science degree from Lincoln University. (P Inq, May 6/91)
Randy Berridge of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation stated that the memorial to American astronauts killed in the line of duty was closed for inspections after strange noises were heard coming from the monument. After engineers checked the structure, it reopened on August 17. Subsequently, Representative Vernon Peeples, chairman of the Florida House Transportation Committee, questioned whether money for the monument had been misused.

Soviet space program experts announced that the 40-ton Soviet Space Station Salyut 7 would break up and fall to earth in February. Tass, the official Soviet press agency, implied Soviet officials had lost control of the station when it said the authorities would issue a "timely warning" to all countries on whose territory station "parts are likely to fall." Salyut 7 was launched in 1982 and last inhabited in 1986, holding up to six astronauts. The Soviet Union had planned to send a rescue mission with the Soviet Space Shuttle Buran but the Shuttle was delayed. (NY Times, Jan 1/91)
Astronaut Manley Lanier "Sonny" Carter, who flew on the Shuttle Discovery in 1989, was one of those killed in the crash of the commuter plane carrying former Senator John Tower. Biographic data were given. (UPI, Apr 5/91; AP, Apr 5/91; AP, Apr 6/91; NY Times, Apr 6/91; W Post, Apr 6/91)
The media carried extensive coverage of the preparatory stages for the mission of Space Shuttle Columbia and its crew. The four medical specialists were to conduct tests on human body functions while the three astronauts flew the Shuttle and were subject to some of the tests. Scientists hoped to learn why astronauts return to Earth with weakened immune systems, reduced bone mass, a decrease in body fluid or blood, fewer red blood cells, and less muscle protein, as well as space motion sickness. The 30 white rats and 2,478 tiny jellyfish being carried were to be analyzed after the flight.
