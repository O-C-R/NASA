Atlantis's astronauts reported the loss of a second scientific instrument, a telescope probing galaxies millions of light years away. Controllers spent hours trying to restore the telescope but to no avail. The telescope, the only astronomical instrument abroad, accomplished 19 observations before the fuse blew. More than 34 were planned for the nine-day mission. (W Post, Mar 31/92; USA Today, Mar 31/92; W Times, Mar 31/92; B Sun, Mar 31/92; NY Times, Mar 31/92)
A NASA "aquanaut" set an endurance record of 69 days, 20 minutes underwater after spending time in a scuba divers' lodge submerged in a Florida Keys Lagoon. Richard Presley began the habitation May 6 as part of an experiment by NASA on conditions astronauts would face during long space missions. (W Times, Jul 15/92; USA Today 15/92; AP, Jul 15/92)
A space-for-rent company unveiled its first Shuttle module, which is scheduled to fly aboard Atlantis in the spring of 1993. The Spacehab module, which consists of up to 61 lockers for experiments, would be the first privately owned and operated space facility that can be tended by astronauts in orbit. (AP, Apr 3/92)
Discovery's astronauts dimmed the Shuttle lights to conserve energy as NASA considered extending the weeklong research mission by a day to collect extra scientific data. (P Inq, Jan 27/92; W Times, Jan 27/92)
Shuttle Endeavour's astronauts reported abnormal behavior for tadpoles hatched aboard the shuttle. Oriental hornets similarly displayed confused, disoriented behavior, seemingly unable to build nests in a weightless environment. The tadpoles and hornets were part of 43 experiments in weightless conditions being carried out on the Shuttle. (UPI, Sept 15/92; W Times, Sept 16/92; UPI, Sept 16/92; AP, Sept 16/92)
