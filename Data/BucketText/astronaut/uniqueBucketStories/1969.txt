Lunar module was “first manned spacecraft ever built that’s not tough enough to survive a return to earth,” said Thomas O’Toole in Washington Post. Vehicle from which two astronauts would descend to moon’s surface in summer 1969 was 23 ft high, weighed 8,000 lbs, and carried 12 tons of propellant. It contained 25 mi of electrical wiring and more than a million parts, most of which had been designed “from scratch,” held together by 216,000 “pins.” Pin bent more than five degrees out of shape would have to be replaced. NASA had contracted for 15 LMs at total cost of $1.9 billion from Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp., which had taken six years to get it from drawing board to launch pad. (W Post, 2/9/69, B2)
Investigating board headed by Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr., reported primary cause of Dec. 8, 1968, crash of nasa’s lunar landing training vehicle (lltv) No. 1 was “that the vehicle entered a region of flight where aerodynamic moments overpowered the control system . . . such that attitude control was lost. The source of the control problem was not identified ... in time to add (use) a second control system which could have restored control capability.” Crash did not involve any malfunctions of systems. Adverse region of flight was entered because the aerodynamic limitations of lltv were not completely understood, wind conditions were insufficiently accounted for, and displays in lltv and support van Were inadequate for conditions. Board made 11 recommendations—including wind-tunnel tests to assess lltv aerodynamic characteristics—for improved safety, (nasa Release 69—87; AP, H Chron, 6/6/69)	.
