The media reported that Discovery astronauts had succeeded in getting data from three scientific instruments to the ground by splicing wires and rearranging cables in a complicated operation. In this way they bypassed the nonfunctioning recorders, based on procedures worked out from the ground. The astronauts earlier had performed additional tests involving fuel canisters hurled from the Shuttle.

The Philadelphia Inquirer described the Temple University Hospital study on behalf of NASA to determine whether amino acid supplements could retard muscle loss. If so, astronauts on long space flights might not need to devote so many hours to exercise. Eighteen volunteers were being cycled through the six-day bed rest program, in groups of three.

The media covered the final countdown preparations of the astronauts for the scheduled launch of Atlantis on July 24. Mission managers were satisfied with the completion of all necessary repairs. Then a storm on July 23 threatened to delay the blastoff, followed by the discovery early the morning of July 24 of trouble with a critical main engine computer. The discovery forced launch cancellation and postponement of the flight by at least one week to install a new unit. UPI reported on repair efforts and attempts to discover the source of the problem.

A feature article in the Los Angeles Times discussed the changing qualifications for astronauts. In the early days of NASA they were tough, independent male test pilots. More recently, they became better educated and diverse in backgrounds, men and women and different ethnic origins. A second article described Mae Jemison, NASA's only black female astronaut.

The press reported that NASA was considering having two astronauts engage in a spacewalk to fix a cargo-door seal of Columbia that could prevent a safe return to Earth. The seal apparently shook loose during launch. It was later reported that NASA ground personnel determined the seal posed no re-entry problems so no spacewalk was needed. This allowed the astronauts more time to pursue their scientific experiments and medical research.
