A newspaper reported that three NASA aquanauts submerged since May 6, 1992, in a research station 30 feet below the surface of Emerald Lagoon, Florida were doing well but missed sunshine and their family members. The exercise was part of preparation for months-long stays aboard space station Freedom. (USA Today, May 22/92)
Many scientists, concerned that there might not be enough money for basic research, question the wisdom of spending huge sums on projects such as the Space Station. Yet, research shows that the economic benefits of NASA's programs are greater than generally recognized. In 1987, NASA's procurement budget generated $17,800 million in total industry sales, had a "multiplier effect" on the economy of 2.1 million people, created 209,000 private-sector jobs and $2,900 million in business profits, and generated $5,600 million in federal, state and local government tax revenues. Furthermore, these benefits were widely distributed throughout the country. (Nature, Jan 9/92)
Rockwell's Space Systems Division and NPO Energia announced that they had signed a contract that was the first step in building docking hardware for a U.S. Space Shuttle/Russian MIR Space Station mission planned for 1995. (AvWk, Nov 2/92)
In a mission called "La Chalupa 30," four men were to conduct investigations in an underwater habitat without any direct outside human contact for 30 days, giving the Behavior and Performance Laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, the opportunity to study team performance as part of its continuing investigation to identify pertinent psychological issues for long duration space flight. "The mission will serve as an environment which is analogous to future extended space missions on the Shuttle or Space Station," said Dr. Al Holland, Head of the Behavior and Performance Laboratory.

A briefing and demonstration of a prototype low vision enhancement system (LVES), cooperatively developed by NASA and the Lions Vision Center at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, was scheduled for to be held May 13 at the Oncology Center Auditorium. The LVES technology, originally developed for possible use on Space Station Freedom, potentially could help millions of Americans afflicted with certain low vision problems. (NASA Note N92-43)
NASA and the National Institutes of Health signed an agreement to enhance each agency's biomedical research capabilities. The agencies pledged to develop programs that apply NASA's unique expertise to practical, medical needs on Earth and in space. The agreement was intended to stimulate new opportunities in the biomedical and behavioral research community because it provides for greater access to space-based facilities as well as involvement by university-based research centers. It was expected to increase support for Space Station Freedom, funding for which was under attack in Congress. (NASA Release 92-119; W Post, Jul 22/92; Space News, Jul 27-Aug 9/92)
The House of Representatives voted to spend $2.1 billion next year for work on NASA's Space Station Freedom as opponents ended their efforts to scuttle the project. (The Sun, Sept 26/92; W Times, Sept 26/92)
The Senate approved funding of $2.1 billion for continuation of the Space Station after defeating a proposal to close down the project because of its expense. The Senate vote, together with House approval in July, assured continued funding and Congressional support for the Space Station.

A joint Russian-French crew blasted off on a 12-day mission aimed at keeping the aging Space Station Mir in orbit until 1996.  The cosmonauts were slated to install a complex of stabilizing gyroscopes inside the Station and also to work in space to assemble an engine to make space navigation easier. (W Times, Jul 22/92; AP, Jul 21/92, Jul 27/92; UPI, Jul 27/92; The Sun, Jul 28/92; WSJ, Jul 28/92; W Post, Jul 28/92; NY Times, July 28/92; APn, Jul 27/92; UPn, Jul 27/92)
House-Senate negotiators agreed yesterday to provide $2.1 billion next fiscal year for Space Station Freedom. The agreement spelled the end of another year of efforts by opponents to kill a program they consider too expensive and of little scientific value. The Space Station was expected to cost $40 billion to build and $100 billion more to operate over its planned 30-year lifetime. (W Post, Sept 23/92; USA Today, Sept 23/92; LA Times, Sept 23/92; The Sun, Sept 23/92; AP, Sept 23/92)
A bipartisan group of prominent Americans proposed a plan to reduce government spending, invest in growth, and reshape the income tax system in the hope of balancing the federal budget in a decade. Decisions on which programs would be cut were left to Congress and the president, but the group suggested that NASA's planned Space Station, mass transit operating aid to cities, and other programs would be prime candidates for funding reductions. (AP, Sept 30/92)
NASA acknowledged that it could not keep the Space Station project on schedule even with the most optimistic current funding projections. The projected level of Congressional appropriations for the next few years meant certain delays in development and launch schedules of anything up to 12 or 18 months. Such delays would mean that the station would miss the official December 1999 target for being able to support a crew on a permanent basis. (AvWk, Sept 14/92)
The Space Station Freedom was saved, as the House of Representatives voted down an amendment aimed at killing the $40 billion project. The House voted 237-181 against an appropriations bill amendment that would have cut $1.2 billion from the 1993 budget for NASA, effectively eliminating the Space Station. The Station was expected to cost $40 billion to build and $100 billion more to operate over its lifetime. It was the fourth time in the last two years that the House had affirmed its commitment to build the Space Station. Supporters said the vote could well represent the program's last serious Congressional challenge. (P Inq, Jul 30/92; LA Times, Jul 30/92; NY Times, Jul 30/92; WSJ, Jul 30/92; W Times, Jul 30/92; W Post, Jul 30/92; The Sun, Jul 30/92; USA Today, Jul 30/92; AP, Jul 30/92; UPI, Jul 30/92; Htsvl Tms, Jul 30/92; AvWk, Aug 3/92)
The planned U.S. Space Station Freedom survived an attempt to kill it when the House of Representatives defeated a move to cut the $2.25 billion needed to keep the program on track. The 254-159 vote to continue funding marked the fourth time the House had voted on the costly and ambitious program in recent years. (UPI, Apr 30/92; AP, Apr 30/92; W Post, Apr 30/92; USA Today, Apr 30/92)
The U.S. Senate rejected by a wide margin a move to cancel NASA's international Space Station but forbade NASA from significantly changing the laboratory's design and schedule. If approved by the House of Representative, the restriction would severely limit NASA's ability to overhaul key aspects of the program. (Space News, Sept 14-20/92)
Opponents of Space Station Freedom, led by Representative Tim Roemer of Indiana, said they would try to strip from the 1993 federal budget virtually all of the $2.25 billion requested for the project by NASA. The attack would come as an amendment to legislation that would set maximum spending levels for the agency over the next three years. (LA Times, Apr 29/92)
