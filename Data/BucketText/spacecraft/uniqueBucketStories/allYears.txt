After a tense 24hour delay of deorbit burn, a Soviet Soyuz TM5 capsule carrying two cosmonauts landed safely in Soviet Central Asia. The Soyuz TM5, returning to Earth from a weeklong visit to the Mir space station, experienced premature shutdowns of its reentry motor during the first two deorbit burn attempts. The first shutdown had been caused by a malfunction in the automatic guidance system, whereas the second failure resulted from improper resetting of the flight computer. The problem was considered by some U.S. space experts as potentially life threatening because the Soyuz was estimated to have only 24 to 48 hours of oxygen left and a limited amount of fuel with which to attempt a third deorbit'"0*burn.

A bipartisan group of prominent Americans proposed a plan to reduce government spending, invest in growth, and reshape the income tax system in the hope of balancing the federal budget in a decade. Decisions on which programs would be cut were left to Congress and the president, but the group suggested that NASA's planned Space Station, mass transit operating aid to cities, and other programs would be prime candidates for funding reductions. (AP, Sept 30/92)
NASA acknowledged that it could not keep the Space Station project on schedule even with the most optimistic current funding projections. The projected level of Congressional appropriations for the next few years meant certain delays in development and launch schedules of anything up to 12 or 18 months. Such delays would mean that the station would miss the official December 1999 target for being able to support a crew on a permanent basis. (AvWk, Sept 14/92)
The Space Station Freedom was saved, as the House of Representatives voted down an amendment aimed at killing the $40 billion project. The House voted 237-181 against an appropriations bill amendment that would have cut $1.2 billion from the 1993 budget for NASA, effectively eliminating the Space Station. The Station was expected to cost $40 billion to build and $100 billion more to operate over its lifetime. It was the fourth time in the last two years that the House had affirmed its commitment to build the Space Station. Supporters said the vote could well represent the program's last serious Congressional challenge.

Writing in the Washington Times, Representative George E. Brown, California Democrat and chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, argued that critics of the Space Station were themselves partially responsible for the delay, confusion, and high costs of the Station because of the annual sniping, redrafting and retrenchment to which they have subjected the  Space Station. Brown maintained that the United States needs the jobs provided by the Space Station, needs the scientific challenges of space-based design and engineering, and needs the emotional satisfaction of exploration and discovery.
An editorial in the Washington Post noted that in light of the budget deficit it was difficult to quarrel with Congress's decision to kill funding for the Superconducting Super Collider. By that same token, however, the Space Station deserved to be killed, especially because the Super Collider had the potential to contribute to human knowledge while the Space Station did not. (W Post, June 30/93)

Several life science researchers questioned whether a redesigned Space Station would accomplish enough life science objectives to be worth the investment. Researchers at a meeting of the NationaL Research Council's Space Studies Board said that they expected a redesign to either shrink or reduce the centrifuge, a set of spinning modules designed for precise gravity experiments on animals aboard the station. Harold Guy, a professor at the University of California's School of Medicine in LaJolla, California, said that without a large centrifuge, much of the station's experimental value for life scientists would be lost. "The life science community may bail out," said Fred Turek, a neurobiologist and chairman of the space biology and medicine committee on the National Research Council's Space Studies Board.

Writing in the Los Angeles Times, aerospace engineer James F. Glass advocated funding the Space Station, arguing that not only does NASA provide jobs and dreams, but it also keeps the country pulling together for America's future. He noted that when NASA, with all its faults, spends a dollar, the taxpayer usually receives a dollar's value.  Ultimately, in Glass's view, the country needs to focus on more than survival; it must reach for the stars. (LA Times, Jul 20/93)

NASA announced that the newly refurbished and improved HST had allowed astronomers to observe the fading, visible-light counterpart of a gamma-ray burst (GRB), a process that researchers called “one of the most energetic and mysterious” in the universe. The scientists speculated that the observable counterpart signified the existence of an unobservable, catastrophic burst of gamma rays, unleashing as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun does in 10 billion years. The New Technology Telescope and the W. M. Keck Telescope, added to the HST in 1997, had enabled scientists to make the observation. According to Gerald J. Fishman of Marshall Space Flight Center, the lead investigator of NASA’s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, astronomers could not overestimate the significance of the find, even if the visible- light phenomenon was only an indicator of another unobservable phenomenon. “This [discovery] opens up a whole new era in GRB research,” Fishman explained. “We now know that it is possible to see the fading optical emission by rapid follow-up observations with powerful telescopes. With several more of these, we should be able to narrow the models of what could be causing these gigantic outbursts.”(NASA, “Hubble Tracks the Fading Optical Counterpart of a Gamma-Ray Burst,” news release 97-63, 1 April 1997.)
Cosmonauts Talgat A. Musabayev and Nikolai M. Budarin, trying for a third time, successfully stabilized a bent solar panel during a spacewalk of 4 hours and 15 minutes. The solar panel was only one of 10 nonfunctioning panels. The crew had not intended to repair the damaged panel fully, but only to stabilize it, so that it would not break loose and hit the space station. The cosmonauts cut short the spacewalk, scheduled to take 51⁄2 hours, when the thruster engine aligning Mir with the Sun ran out of fuel. Forced to return to the space station early, the cosmonauts were unable to remove some scientific equipment attached to the outside of the station.(Florida Today (Brevard, FL), “Mir Crew Shortens Spacewalk After Thruster Fuel Runs Out,” 7 April 1998. 459 Edith M.

NASA announced that Boeing Company’s cost overruns for the International Space Station (ISS) had increased by about 30 percent to US$783 million, and that NASA intended to “further cut the company’s bonus fees.” In reporting to NASA the latest cost overruns, Boeing had explained that “continued production and testing and the need to set aside money for contingencies” had caused the latest increase, US$183 million more than the US$600 million previously estimated. Under the terms of NASA’s cost-plus-fee contract, Boeing would lose an additional US$27.5 million in bonus fees, besides the US$78 million reduction that NASA had imposed.(Seattle Times (WA), “Boeing Reports More Space Station Overruns,” 7 August 1998.)
NASA awarded US$33 million in grants to 48 researchers, to conduct microgravity biotechnology research through NASA’s Office of Life and Microgravity Science and Applications. To those investigators awarded the 40 grants for ground-based research, NASA provided access to its microgravity research facilities, including aircraft flying parabolic trajectories and sounding rockets. NASA awarded eight grants to flight-definition investigators, to prepare for experiments on the International Space Station (ISS).(NASA, “NASA Announces Research Grants in Microgravity Biotechnology,” news release 98-217, 1 December 1998.)
The crew of the Mir space station replaced the malfunctioning computer block, which had failed on 2 January, and restarted the station’s orientation system. This common type of malfunction, which had occurred seven times in 1997, did not create life-threatening conditions, but it did reduce the power supply to the space station, thereby crippling the gyroscope that oriented the station’s solar panels. Using the Soyuz escape module engines to control its orientation, Mir turned off all nonessential systems, to conserve energy until the crew had completed the repair.(Washington Post, “Mir Crew Replaces Computer Block,” 4 January 1998; Chicago Tribune, “New Year, Old Woe—Mir Computer Glitch,” 3 January 1998.)
SPACEHAB Inc. and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) signed a contract granting SPACEHAB the use of one of the CSA’s experiment lockers on the International Space Station (ISS), beginning in May 2001. According to the agreement between the two organizations, the CSA had committed to commercializing half of its allocated space aboard the space station, a global first in space commercialization.
NASA announced that new analysis of data from the Galileo spacecraft suggested that Jupiter is possibly much older and colder than previously thought. Upon reaching the planet on 7 December 1995, Galileo had dropped a probe carrying a mass spectrometer into Jupiter’s atmosphere to measure its chemical composition. The spectrometer had “detected surprisingly high concentrations of argon, krypton, and xenon,” raising questions about the noble gases’ provenance. Because Jupiter would have trapped the gases through condensation or freezing, scientists did not believe Jupiter’s atmosphere had trapped the gases at its present site. As positioned at present, Jupiter is too close to the Sun and too warm to have trapped the gases. Tobias Owen, an astronomy professor at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaii and a member of the Galileo probe Neutral Mass Spectrometer team, suggested three hypotheses to explain how the gases had been trapped within the Jovian atmosphere: 1) Jupiter had formed in the area around the Kuiper Belt829 and was dragged inward to its present location; 2) the solar nebula, the cloud of gas and dust that formed the solar system, had been much colder than scientists had previously believed; and 3) the solid materials that had brought the gases to Jupiter had begun to form in the original interstellar cloud of gas and dust, before the cloud had collapsed to form the solar nebula. Owen remarked further that, if either of the last two hypotheses were correct, then giant planets might be able to form closer to their stars than current theories had predicted. Such a finding could help explain “the new observations of planetary systems around other stars, in which such close-in giant planets are relatively common.”(NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, “Galileo Probe Results Suggest Jupiter Had an Ancient, Chilly Past,” news release 99-096, 17 November 1999, http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/99/glprobeargon.html (accessed 12 March 2008); Tobias Owen et al., “A Low-Temperature Origin for the Planetesimals that Formed Jupiter,” Nature 402, no. 6759 (18 November 1999): 269–270.)
An Israeli court indicted Israeli teenager Ehud Tenenbaum and four accomplices⎯Guy Fleisher, Ariel Rosenfeld, Barak Abutbul, and Rafael Ohana⎯for illegal entry of computers in the United States and Israel. The group allegedly hacked into the computer systems of the Pentagon and NASA, as well as those of academic institutions in Israel and Israel’s Knesset.(Chicago Tribune, “5 Are Indicted for Hacking in the U.S.,” 10 February 1999. 667 Associated Press, “Hubble May Have Early Planet Images,” 10 February 1999.)
Atlantis touched down at KSC in Cape Canaveral, Florida, only the 14th time that a NASA Shuttle had landed in darkness. NASA controllers used infrared cameras to monitor the Shuttle’s final descent. The return of the Shuttle ended the crucial mission to repair the ISS and reset the space station’s orbit to an optimal altitude. NASA’s Mission Control, congratulating the crew on a “super mission,” began almost immediately to anticipate the flurry of missions that would finally complete construction on the ISS. Atlantis had sustained minor damage during the trip, mainly dents and scratches on its wings caused by ice. Three members of the returning crew, astronauts Susan J. Helms and James S. Voss and cosmonaut Yury V. Usachev, had a special interest in monitoring the ISS’s completion, because they had been selected for the second research crew to the ISS and would make a long-term stay aboard the research station.(William Harwood, “Shuttle Ends Repair Trip to Station,” Washington Post, 30 May 2000; USA Today, “Shuttle Crew Returns from Space Station Repair Mission,” 30 May 2000; Associated Press, “Nighttime Landing Ends Shuttle Repair Mission,” 30 May 2000.)
NASA’s JPL announced that the Cassini spacecraft, after successfully undergoing a series of tests, was resuming the use of its electrically powered reaction wheels to control its orientation. Although mission scientists were uncertain of the cause of the spacecraft’s switch to a different maneuvering system, they suggested that a small piece of material, perhaps from the motor’s magnets, might have lodged in an area where it caused friction. Because the scientists were unable actually to detect any such material, they speculated further that either centrifugal force had subsequently forced the material out, or the motor had ground it up. Scientists also suggested that reduced lubrication in the bearings, during prolonged operation at reduced speeds, might have caused the problem, and that, perhaps, the increased motor speeds used during the tests had restored the lubrication.(NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, “Resuming Use of Reaction Wheels,” news release, 21 December 2000, http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press-release-details.cfm?newsID=6 (accessed 21 April 2008).)
A team of astronomers using the HST published results of the first direct detection and chemical analysis of the atmosphere of a planet located outside of the solar system. The scientists had used Hubble to examine the planet’s atmosphere as it passed in front of its parent star―called HD 209458―a technique that enabled them to see the star’s light filtered through the planet’s atmosphere. During the analysis, the astronomers had detected sodium in the planet’s atmosphere. They hoped that the observation was a harbinger of a new phase in analyses of extrasolar planets, often referred to as exoplanets. Scientists also hoped that this type of analysis would enable them to measure any unusual abundance of atmospheric gases created by living organisms, thereby offering them a method of acquiring direct evidence of life on other planets.(NASA, “Hubble Measures Atmosphere on World Around Another Star,” news release 01-232, 27 November 2001.)
NASA awarded Boeing Information, Space, and Defense Systems a US$936 million modification to its contract for the ISS. Under the contract, which had commenced in 1995, Boeing was providing construction, integration, and operations for the ISS. The modification extended Boeing’s integration and operation work until 31 December 2003 and increased the total contract value to US$10.7 billion.(NASA, “NASA Awards $936 Million Modification to Boeing Space Station Contract,” news release c02-d, 7 February 2002.)
of two objects that orbit around a common center of mass as they both orbit the Sunwith a highly eccentric orbit and a long period. However, they had found that 1998 WW31 is very different from the Pluto/Charon system, which was previously the only known binary in the Kuiper Belt. The Kuiper Belt is the region of space that extends from Neptune, at 30 AU (astronomical units)the approximate mean distance between Earth and the Sun) to more than 100 AU. Since its discovery in 1992, the Kuiper Belt has helped scientists understand the solar system’s formation. Although scientists had discovered 1998 WW31 in 1998, they had reported it as a single Kuiper Belt object. However, analysis of observations made in 2000 indicated that the object might contain two components. Further analysis, using ground-based and HST observations made in 2001 and 2002, confirmed 1998 WW31’s binarity.(Christian Veillet, “The Binary Kuiper-Belt Object 1998 WW31,” Nature 416, no. 6882 (18 April 2002): 711– 713; NASA, “Hubble Hunts Down Odd Couples at the Fringes of Our Solar System,” news release 02-70, 17 April 2002.)
Scientists announced an estimate of the universe’s age based on new HST images of very faint white dwarf stars in Messier 4 (M4), a cluster of stars in the constellation Scorpius. The researchers had closely examined M4’s white dwarf starslow-mass stars that have exhausted their fuel sources for thermonuclear fusion. Although white dwarfs cool at a predictable rate, enabling scientists to estimate their age, they become progressively fainter as they cool, making them difficult to observe. The HST had provided the first deep exposures of these dim stars, which the astronomers discovered were M4’s oldest white dwarf stars, at around 12 to 13 billion years old. Earlier Hubble observations had revealed that the first stars in the universe had formed less than 1 billion years after the universe’s emergence from the Big Bang. Thus, the researchers had discovered that the age of these M4 white dwarfs supported the previous estimates that the universe’s age is 13 to 14 billion years old. The use of this new methodology to estimate the universe’s age represented a major departure from those used previously.(NASA, “Hubble Uncovers Oldest ‘Clocks’ in Space To Read Age of Universe,” news release 02-73, 24 April 2004; Brad M. S. Hansen et al., “The White Dwarf Cooling Sequence of the Globular Cluster Messier 4,” Astrophysical Journal 574, no. 2 (1 August 2002): L155–L158.)
The Canadian Space Agency awarded a four-year, US$116 million contract to MD Robotics to provide engineering services for robotic elements for the ISS. Under the contract, MD Robotics, a subsidiary of MacDonald, Dettweiler and Associates Ltd., would maintain and upgrade software for robotic components and would continue developing and testing a two-armed robot called Dextre, scheduled for installation at the ISS in 2005. MD Robotics had designed Dextre for attachment to the ISS, either at the end of the robotic arm currently in place―Canadarm 2―or on the mobile base station. Dextre would perform external maintenance tasks at the ISS.(Jason Bates, “MacDonald Dettweiler Nabs Space Station Contract,” Space News, 3 June 2003.)
Data from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft revealed a new radiation belt around Saturn. Researchers already knew that Saturn had radiation belts―ring-shaped concentrations of ionized particles―outside the orbit of the planet’s rings. However, the newly discovered rings were inside Saturn’s rings. Previously, scientists had thought that a radiation belt could not exist inside the planet’s rings, because they believed that the rings would absorb any ionized particles that approached Saturn. The presence of radiation within the orbit of the rings indicated that the radiation belt’s particles are able to move through Saturn’s rings.(John Noble Wilford, “Spacecraft Finds Belt Around Saturn Unlike Any Ever Seen Before,” New York Times, 6 August 2004.)
NASA’s Cassini spacecraft provided data revealing two previously unknown moons orbiting Saturn―a new total of 33 identified moons orbiting the planet. The two moons―designated S/2004-S1 and S/2004-S2, until receiving their formal names―measured 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) and 21⁄2 miles (4 kilometers) in diameter. Because of the moons’ diminutive size, scientists suspected that they might be fragments from a larger moon.(Mark Carreau, “Cassini Finds Two More Saturn Moons,” Houston Chronicle, 19 August 2004; New York Times, “2 Little Saturn Moons,” 17 August 2004.)
A group of astronomers announced the most detailed telescopic view ever taken of the visible universe. NASA’s HST had captured a 1 million-second-long exposure of a small portion of dark sky, with a resulting image containing an estimated 10,000 galaxies, some so far away that astronomers had never before seen them. Astronomers called the image the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. They believed that the Hubble Ultra Deep Field might have revealed light from galaxies created near the time of the Big Bang and hoped that the image would provide information about the creation of the universe.(NASA, “Hubble’s Deep View of the Universe Unveils Earliest Galaxies,” news release 04-086, 9 March 2004; Dennis Overbye, “Images Reveal Deepest Glance into Universe,” New York Times, 10 March 2004.)
NASA celebrated the HST’s 15th anniversary with the release of new images of the Eagle Nebula and the Whirlpool galaxy (spiral galaxy M51), two of the most well-known objects that the Hubble had observed to date. The new images, made with the HST’s newest camera, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), were among the largest and sharpest the Hubble had yet captured, so sharp that, even if enlarged to billboard size, the image would preserve the stunning details. The new image of the Eagle Nebula revealed ultraviolet light originating from a group of massive hot stars and sculpting a tall, dense tower of gas. The new image of the Whirlpool galaxy, in addition to displaying its classic features, revealed a companion galaxy located at the end of one of the Whirlpool galaxy’s arms. The launch of the HST in 1990 had ushered in a new era in astronomy. Before the existence of the HST, no telescope had viewed the universe in visible light from above Earth’s atmosphere, which blurs light and causes images to appear fuzzy. Among its many achievements, the HST had helped astronomers calculate the precise age of the universe; helped confirm the existence of dark energy; detected small protogalaxies; proved the existence of supermassive black holes; provided sharp views of a comet hitting Jupiter; and demonstrated that the process of planetary system formation is common throughout the galaxy.(NASA, “Hubble Celebrates 15th Anniversary with Spectacular New Images,” news release 05-104, 25 April 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/apr/HQ_05104_HST_anniversary.html (accessed 29 June 2009). 782 NASA, “NASA Establishes Exploration Systems Advisory Committee,” news release 05-106, 25 April 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/apr/HQ_05106_esac_meeting.html (accessed 29 June 2009).)
Scientists announced that NASA’s Cassini spacecraft had detected water vapor on Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons. Scientists described this as one of the most important findings in planetary science, because the discovery suggested that liquid water might exist on Enceladus. Liquid water is a prerequisite for the formation of life. Scientists had already known that Enceladus has a crystalline ice covering, the most reflective type of surface in the solar system, making Enceladus the brightest object in the solar system with the exception of the Sun. In addition, scientists had already known that diminutive Enceladus, which is only 310 miles (500 kilometers) in diameter, is the smallest object in the solar system to have volcanic activity. However, scientists were surprised to discover water vapor over Enceladus’s south pole, and they were unable to explain the finding. NASA and ESA had launched Cassini in 1997 to survey Saturn and its moons.(Guy Gugliotta, “Water Vapor Discovered on Tiny Moon of Saturn,” Washington Post, 19 September 2005. 838 NASA, “NASA Releases Plans for Next Generation Spacecraft,” news release 05-226, 19 September 2005; NASA, “NASA’s Exploration Systems Architecture Study,” November 2005, http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/news/ESAS_report.html (accessed 10 July 2009).)
Data from NASA’s HST revealed 16 objects, possibly the most distant planets ever observed by the HST. Scientists believed that the objects were extrasolar planets—planets located outside of Earth’s solar system—orbiting various stars in the Milky Way’s central region, 26,000 light- years away from Earth. Because of the distance and faintness of the objects’ star systems, scientists could acquire mass measurements for only two of the planets. Therefore, they designated the objects as “candidate” extrasolar planets. The HST data also revealed that five of the newly discovered planets were Ultra-Short-Period Planets (USPPs), a type of planet not found in searches of neighboring areas of the Milky Way. USPPs orbit their stars in less than one Earth day.(NASA, “Hubble Finds Extrasolar Planets Far Across Galaxy,” news release 06-326, 4 October 2006, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/oct/HQ_06326_Extra_planets.html (accessed 31 March 2010).)
An international team of scientists led by Giacomo Giampieri of NASA’s JPL reported in Nature the results of their study measuring Saturn’s rotation period. Using magnetic field data collected by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft in 2003 and 2004, the researchers estimated that the rotation rate of Saturn is almost 8 minutes longer than the 10 hours, 39 minutes, and 22.4 seconds calculated in 1980. Scientists had based the 1980 measurement on the Voyager spacecraft’s observations of the radio waves generated when solar radiation hits Saturn’s atmosphere. Whereas scientists were able to measure the rotation period of other planets by comparing their magnetic and rotational axes, they could not use this procedure for Saturn, because its rotational axis is nearly identical to the axis of its magnetic field. Instead, scientists had measured distortions in the radio signals that Saturn emits—distortions that they believed were related to the planet’s magnetic field—to estimate the planet’s rotation rate. According to Giampieri, a planet’s rotation rate indicates the amount of centrifugal force acting on the interior of the planet, data that provides “a very important ingredient for planetary modeling.”(Giacomo Giampieri et al., “A Regular Period for Saturn’s Magnetic Field that May Track its Internal Rotation,” Nature 441, no. 7089 (4 May 2006): 62–64; Ker Than, “Length of Saturn’s Day Updated Based on Mystery Signal,” Space.com, 3 May 2006.)
NASA announced that it had signed Commercial Space Transportation Capabilities Agreements with PlanetSpace, of Chicago and Transformational Space Corporation in Reston, Virginia, to facilitate the commercialization of low Earth orbit. According to these nonreimbursable Space Act agreements, NASA would provide no funding to either company. Instead, the agreements established milestones and objective criteria that the companies would use to measure progress. The agreements stipulated that NASA share information with the two companies, to help them understand NASA’s projected requirements for space station crew, transportation launch vehicles, and spacecraft, as well as NASA’s human-rating criteria, which indicates how safe a spacecraft, launch vehicle, or airplane is for transporting people. Each company would develop and demonstrate vehicles, systems, and operations required to transport crews and cargo to and from low Earth orbit. Scott J. Horowitz, NASA’s Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems, explained that stimulating the growth of commercial space enterprise would enable NASA to focus on long-range exploration of the Moon and Mars.(NASA, “Commercial Space Transportation Capabilities Agreements Signed,” news release 07-20, 1 February 2007, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/feb/HQ_0720_COTS_agreements.html (accessed 13 January 2010); PlanetSpace, “NASA Signs Agreement with PlanetSpace for Development of Commercial Space Transportation Capabilities,” news release, 1 February 2007, http://www.planetspace.org/pdf/PressRelease020107.pdf (accessed 13 January 2010).)
to connect, forming a space station. According to Bigelow Aerospace’s spokesperson Chris Reed, data indicated that Genesis 2 had adequate air pressure and its power system had good voltage; however, data did not officially confirm the deployment of its solar panels or the expansion of its outer shell. Genesis 2 was a near duplicate of Genesis 1, which had launched in July 2006 and remained operational. Genesis 2 carried a new suite of sensors and avionics to monitor and control the craft while in orbit, as well as 22 cameras, compared to the 13 aboard Genesis 1. Genesis 2 also carried a multi-tank system to inflate the module with compressed air, an improvement over Genesis 1 that added vital redundancy in the inflation process and allowed better control of the craft’s gas supplies.

NASA announced that Richard J. Gilbrech would be resigning his position as NASA’s Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems to accept a position in the private sector. During his 17 years of service with NASA, Gilbrech had held positions as Director of NASA’s SSC and as Deputy Center Director of NASA’s LaRC. Effective 24 November 2008, Douglas R. Cooke would replace Gilbrech. Cooke was serving as Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems. In his 35 years with NASA, Cooke had served as Manager for the Advanced Development Office at NASA’s JSC, Manager of the Exploration Programs Office, and Deputy Manager of the Space Station Program. He had served as a technical advisor to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, a member of the team that conducted the 90-day study on lunar and Mars exploration, and a member of the Synthesis Group, which had reported to the White House on America’s space exploration initiative.(NASA, “NASA Announces Exploration Systems Directorate Leadership Changes,” news release 08-286, 12 November 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08-286_ESMD_leadership.html (accessed 12 November 2011).)
