proton hi unmanned scientific space station was launched by U.S.S.R. into earth orbit with 630-km. (391-mi.) apogee; 190-km. (118-mi.) perigee; 92.5-min. period; and 63.5° inclination. Instruments —including "special scientific apparatus” for continuing complex investigations of cosmic rays—were functioning normally. (Tass, Krasnaya Zvezda, 7/8/66, 1, uss-T Trans.)
nasa ApoUo Service Module (Sm) propulsion engine test phase was completed at Arnold Engineering Development Center, (aedc)
usaf selected Martin Co. to develop SV-5P manned lifting-body vehicle to explore flight characteristics and atmospheric maneuverability of wingless lifting bodies. Initially, the 5,000-lb., 24-ft. wingless vehicle would be dropped from a B-52 bomber at 40,000- to 50,000-ft. altitude at 500 mph for powerless, gliding flight, landing at Edwards afb at 120 to 150 mph; in later powered tests, it would accelerate to mach 2 speeds at 100,000-ft. altitude and then maneuver to landing. Airfoil shape of vehicle, which resembled "a delta shaped porpoise with vertical fins,” provided lift normally derived from wings. Future vehicles, developed as part of afsc’s Piloted Low Speed Test (Pilot) project, would be launched to ferry supplies and crews between earth and orbiting space stations, (dod Release 343-66; Wilford, NYT, 4/27/66, 22)
