NASA issued a request for proposals to design and build a groundbased radar that would quantify and characterize debris orbiting between 180 to 360 miles above Earth. The radar would have the capability of detecting debris as small as 1 centimeter in diameter, contrasted with the 10centimeter capability of current radar systems. The data gathered by the orbital debris radar would be used in designing the permanently crewtended Space Station Freedom, which would be built to withstand as much orbital debris damage as possible.
