The U.S.S.R. launched its 76th space mission for 1975, an unmanned Soyuz 20, from Baykonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam, and established a new procedure by identifying the unmanned flight as a spacecraft designed for manned flight. Reuters quoted Soviet scientist Dr. Konstantin Feoktistov as saying the purpose of the flight was to develop a transport system either to supply a space station with expendables, or to serve as an emergency rescue ship. One possibility would be to automatically dock a Soyuz with the manned station after one of the cosmonauts had removed the original Soyuz, or perhaps a new Soyuz would be used as a new return vehicle: one of these procedures would be required unless the Salyut space station had been designed with two docking positions. The Soviet director of Julyâ€™s Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, Konstantin Bushuyev, in Houston for a conference, said Soyuz 20 had not been designed to transfer expendables to the current Salyut 4 space station; Christopher S. Wren, reporting from Moscow for the New York Times, pointed out that it was not known how provisions could be transferred from the Soyuz to the space station, since neither craft had been reported to have such an automatic capability.
