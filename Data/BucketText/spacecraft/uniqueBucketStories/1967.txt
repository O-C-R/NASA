U.S. could have a permanent manned space station in orbit by 1970, predicted Charles W. Mathews, Director of Saturn/Apollo Applications, NASA Hq. omsf, in Space Business Daily interview. Mathews said that by clustering various modules, instrument packages, and spacecraft in orbit for reuse and utilizing resupply of expendables and crew replacement, it would be possible to extend capabilities of hardware currently under development to the point where such a space station could be permanently manned in about three years.

Low-orbit space operations from a manned orbital base “has the potential to reduce operating costs by a factor of two” for the mission traffic anticipated for post-1970, G. A. Sears of the rand Corp. had concluded. His papier, Orbital Baaing: Key to Low Cost Space Operations?, compared present earth-based manned spaceflight program with concept of basing spacecraft at manned space station. Spacecraft would be injected into mission orbits as required and later rejuvenated for reuse by rendezvous with station. Spacecraft would have to operate nearly coplanar with base, a constraint acceptable to many but not all low-orbit missions; however, as method of reducing costs, orbital basing “deserves attention on a par with recovery-to-earth and reuse and extended-life concepts,” Sears stated.

NASA was negotiating nine-month, $275,000 contract with Planning Research Corp. to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential economic returns from possible space station activities in mid-1970’s. Earth-oriented application areas such as natural resources, meteorology, and communications would be considered as they might affect both the national and world economy. Univ. of Michigan would be major subcontractor to Planning Research in technical feasibility of remote sensing. Contract would be managed by omsf Advanced Manned Missions Program.
