Three Soviet cosmonauts who had been occupying the Mir Space Station returned to Earth aboard a Soyuz TM7 capsule. The three cosmonauts landed safely in Soviet Central Asia near the city of Dzheskazgan. The departure of the Mir crew marked the first time that the station has been left untended since crew rotations began in February 1987. Soviet space program officials announced that two new experiment modules would be attached to the station in anticipation of the arrival in August of the next crew.

This date marked the twentieth anniversary of the first crewassisted landing on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin. Armstrong, Aldrin, and their crewmate, Michael Collins, commemorated the lunar landing with ceremonies at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC, and the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. During the Washington ceremony, attended by President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, the President proposed a long range program of humanassisted space exploration, including a permanently habitable base on the Moon and a crew expedition to Mars, but did not establish a specific timetable. The President cited Space Station Freedom as an important stepping stone toward missions to the Moon and Mars. Speaking at the National Air and Space Museum, Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to step on the lunar surface, said: "The Apollo program enjoyed a certain nobility of purposea program not to conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance. A program not to exploit, but to explore. A program not to take from others, but to give to all, to give new knowledge, to enlarge the human horizon."

The Soviet Union announced that it would suspend occupation of the Mir Space Station for at least three months following the return to Earth of its current crew in late April. The reason given by the Soviets for the abandonment of the station, which had been continuously occupied since February 1987, was a delay in the manufacture of additional pressurized modules to be attached to the facility. Western experts were interpreting the temporary shutdown of the station as a possible costcutting measure and another setback to the Soviet space program following the loss of its twin Mars probes during the last several months. Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine was also reporting that degradation of the station's solar power arrays was causing an electrical shortage.

Two Soviet astronauts were successfully launched aboard a Soyuz TM8 capsule for a rendezvous with the Mir Space Station. The Soyuz TM8 capsule was launched aboard a Proton launch vehicle emblazoned with several commercial advertisements. Cosmonauts Alexander S. Viktorenko and Alexander A. Serebrov were scheduled to reoccupy the Mir station during a sixmonth tour and supervise the attachment of two new modules to the facility. Mir had been left unoccupied since April 27 because of funding constraints and delays in manufacturing of the new modules.

NASA rolled out a fullscale mockup of the proposed ShuttleC, a new heavy lift launch vehicle based on Space Shuttle technology. The 115foot mockup, constructed in a Hangar at the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama, was put on display in an effort to gain support for funding of the $1.5 billion ShuttleC development program in the fiscal year 1991 Federal budget. The ShuttleC would be an untended launch vehicle that would fly "piggyback" on the standard Shuttle SRM and external tank assembly and would have a greater payload capacity than the current Shuttles. ShuttleC could substitute for the crewtended0*Shuttles in the launching of components for Space Station Freedom. AP, Apr 18/89; LA Times, Apr 19;/89)
NASA issued a request for proposals to design and build a groundbased radar that would quantify and characterize debris orbiting between 180 to 360 miles above Earth. The radar would have the capability of detecting debris as small as 1 centimeter in diameter, contrasted with the 10centimeter capability of current radar systems. The data gathered by the orbital debris radar would be used in designing the permanently crewtended Space Station Freedom, which would be built to withstand as much orbital debris damage as possible.

NASA Administrator Dr. James C. Fletcher and the Ambassador of Japan to the United States H.E. Nobuo Matsunaga signed a Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the government of Japan on cooperation in the detailed design, development, operation, and utilization of the Space Station Freedom. The agreement was signed at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC. Under the agreement, Japan would provide the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) to the Freedom program. The JEM, to be permanently attached to the Space Station base, would consist of a pressurized laboratory module, at least two experiment0*logistics modules, and an exposed facility.

The Soviet Union successfully launched an untended Proton launch vehicle carrying an attachment module bound for the Mir Space Station from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. The pressurized module, known as the Kvant2, contained additional crew living space as well as experiments and a "space motorcycle" intended for use in extravehicular spacewalks.

A report by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) entitled "Round Trip to Orbit: Human Space Flight Alternatives" recommended construction of a fifth Space Shuttle orbiter or a Shuttlederived launch vehicle in preparation for the Space Station assembly missions of the late 1990s. Citing estimates of Space Shuttle reliability of 97 to 99 percent, OTA warned that there was an 88 percent likelihood that another Shuttle orbiter would be lost before Space Station construction is completed. The OTA report stated: "Buying more orbiters would increase the resiliency of the Space Shuttle system...[and] its ability to recover rapidly from loss of another orbiter or any other event that delays launches. The Shuttle orbiter fleet is likely to continue to suffer occasional attrition." (AP, Aug 2/89; UPI, Aug 2/89; W Post, Aug

NASA announced that Martin Marietta Corporation of Bethesda, Maryland, had won a $297 million contract to develop the Flight Telerobotic Servicer (FTS), a space robot that would help construct and maintain the Space Station Freedom. Development of the robot was expected to take nine years and would include flight testing of a prototype aboard the Space Shuttle. Once deployed during an early Space Station construction mission, the mobile robot would be controlled remotely by astronauts from within the station, thereby minimizing the amount of "spacewalk" activity that astronauts would need to perform.

The National Research Council (NRC) recommended that NASA abandon plans to participate in development of a commercial orbiting space laboratory that had been promoted by the Reagan administration and some members of Congress. In recommending against the development of the Industrial Space Facility, the NRC argued that experiments foreseen for the space laboratory could be performed aboard the Space Shuttle and on Shuttlebased facilities during the period leading to the completion of Space Station Freedom.

NASA Administrator Dr. James C. Fletcher announced his resignation, effective April 8. Dr. Fletcher had served as NASA Administrator for a total of nine years, from April 1971 to May 1977, and again since May 1986, following the Challenger accident. Dr. Fletcher, who reluctantly agreed to return to the Agency at the request of President Ronald Reagan, supervised the adoption of a new management system that put greater emphasis on quality control and safety for the Shuttle program. During his second term, Dr. Fletcher had oversight of the redesign of the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters and successfully lobbied Congress for continuation of the Space Station program. In his resignation announcement, Dr. Fletcher said he now felt that he could "safely place the leadership of NASA in another's hands." NASA Deputy Administrator Dale Myers served as Acting Administrator until a successor was named by President George Bush.
