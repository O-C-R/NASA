Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson said in commencement address at Univ. of Maryland: “We are not reaching for prestige in space—we are reaching for peace. And this is considerably more urgent than many realize or others will yet admit .... “In exploring space, we are exploring the environment of the earth itself. We are finding paths through a new dimension—and historically civilizations have stood or fallen according to their ability to move through a dimension. “We seek to make space an instrument for peace and the development of mankind. But if we abandon the field, space can be preempted by others as an instrument for aggression. “And in a world of competing social systems, we would be naive indeed if we failed to recognize how bleak the future would be if this new dimension became the realm of tyranny. For your children, and your children’s children, an iron curtain would be drawn across the pathway to the- stars . . . .” (Text, CR, 6/18/63, A3867)

In press conference, President Kennedy was asked: “By when do you think we will be first in space, and in view of Russia’s current lunar probe [lunik iv], do you think we will beat the Russians with a man to the moon ?” He replied: “I don’t know. We started well behind. Quite obviously they had a tremendous advantage in big boosters and we are still behind, because obviously we haven’t gotten our new boosters yet, which we won’t get until 1964, ’65 and ’66. We will have to wait and see but I can assure you it is an uphill race at best, because we started behind, and I am sure the Russians are making a major effort. Today’s indication of what they are doing makes me feel that their program is a major one, and it is not spongy, and I think that we would have to make the same ourselves. “So I would say we are behind now, and we will continue to be behind, but if we make a major effort we have a chance, I believe, to be ahead at the end of this decade, and that is where I think we ought to be.” Questioned about his reaction to General Eisenhower’s charge that the national budget could be reduced by billions of dollars and that enormous sums were being wTasted in the space program (letter to Congressman Charles A. Halleck made public March 291, President Kennedy said: “. . . The United States Congress almost unanimously made a decision that the United States would not continue to be second in space. We are second in space today because we started late. It requires a large sum of money. I don’t think we should look with equanimity upon the prospect that we will be second all through the sixties and possibly the seventies. We have the potential not to be. I think having made the decision last year, that we should make a major effort to be first in space. I think we should continue to do so. “President Eisenhower—this is not a new position for him. He has disagreed with this at least a year or year and a half ago when the Congress took a different position. It is the position I think he took from the time of Sputnik on. But it is a matter on which we disagree. It may be that there is waste in the space budget. If there is waste, then I think it ought to be cut by the Congress, and I am sure it will be. But if we are going to get into the question of whether we should reconcile ourselves to a slow pace in space, I don’t think so. “This Administration has concentrated its attention since it came into office on strengthening our military. That is one of the reasons why you could not possibly put in the cut which has been recommended, nine or ten billion dollars, without cutting the heart out of the military budget. The fact of the matter is when we came into office, we had 11 combat-ready divisions and we now have 16. We increased the scheduling on Polaris, nearly double per year. We increased the number of planes on the 15-minute alert from 33 per cent of our strategic air force to 50 per cent. In a whole variety of ways—in the Navy we have added about 46 vessels, and strengthened ourselves in defense and space . . . .” (Transcript, Wash. Post, 4/4/63)
Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., nasa Associate Administrator, presented before House Committee on Science and Astronautics an account of nasa’s use of FY 1963 funds. Explaining $170 million decrease in launch vehicle costs because of lunar-orbit-rendezvous decision, he said nasa had deferred developmental phase of Nova very large launch vehicle and was conducting “further studies on the requirements and design concepts of a large launch vehicle consistent with optimum post-lunar-landing usage .... We are continuing [M-lj engine developments [for Nova], since it is a long lead time component, but have reduced the level of contractor effort to reflect the removal of a firm operafinrml firmnrr	^ V1V11U1 l.lllllllg •	•	•	• Speaking on space sciences, Dr. Seamans said: “Extensive study of the biological science area has demonstrated that specific recoverable satellite flights should be undertaken for the purpose of acquiring data on the effects of space environment on living matter. We are, therefore, undertaking such a bio-satellite program and have increased our estimated funding requirements in this area by $13.9 million in this fiscal year.” On communications satellites, Dr. Seamans said: “We re-examined our Communication Satellite program quite carefully in the light of the creation of the Communication Satellite Corporation and the reoriented activities of the dod following the cancellation of the Advent project. From this programmatic re-examination we have concluded that principal nasa effort should be focused on the research and development problems associated with the synchronous altitude class of communication satellite. We have, therefore, dropped the low altitude mutliple passive satellite project, Rebound, and advanced intermediate active satellite projects from hardware development consideration at this time. As a result of these decisions, we reduced our communication satellite program by $35.2 million . . . .” (Testimony)
Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Chairman of National Aeronautics and Space Council, interviewed in Washington Post magazine, Parade. Asked “with all our needs on earth, can we afford to spend $20 billion to go to the moon?” he replied: “We can’t afford not to spend it. Only the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. have the resources for extensive space exploration. If we are to lead the free world and insure our own security, we must be first in space. This does not mean that we must neglect other urgent needs. We have ample resources to explore space and do the other things, as well.” Asked “What is our ultimate destiny in space?” he replied: “I don’t know, nor does anyone else. Columbus didn’t find what he was looking for, but I think we’re all pretty glad that he took that voyage. Einstein, when he produced the formula E=MC2, didn’t know that it would change the course of history. “I am sure of one thing—the benefits which will flow from our venture into space will be beyond anything any of us could imagine. “Until now, in space, no shot has been fired in anger. Thank God. My hope is that, in the years ahead, the conquest of space will encourage peaceful co-operation among nations and become a substitute for war. “In the hostile environment of space there are challenges all mankind must share. We—all nations, that is—should go out there together, hand in hand.” (Parade, Wash. Post, 9/29/63)

Cargill Hall—into the Congressional Record. Chairman Miller pointed out that “in space affairs we cannot afford to be shortsighted or wrong” and asked that proposals of 1946-49 be considered in the light of the current discussion on the U.S. space program: “What if the United States had launched a satellite in 1952 or even 1954? Would history have been different? . . . Would not the image of the U.S. in the eyes of the rest of the world have been spared the historical blemish of Sputnik, the appearance that we were not the scientific and technological leader in the world ? ...

General Accounting Office (gao) released report on nasa’s Centaur booster which was sharply critical of both Government and contractor performance. Done at the request of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics and submitted to them on March 29, 1963, but not released until Oct. 3, the report charged that poor management and program slippage had added $100 million to the cost of the program. The most significant charge in the report was that nasa and the contractor—General Dynamics/Astronautics—had in their possession in 1960 data from which could have been predicted the failure of the first test flight in 1962. The only immediate reply came from Julian Scheer, nasa’s Deputy Assistant Administrator for Technology Utilization and Policy Planning: “On Sept. 30, 1962, we moved the Centaur project from Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville to the Lewis Research Center because we knew we had problems. Still, we hope to fly Centaur by the end of this year.” {Wash. Post, 10/4/63; Space Bus. Daily, 10/4/63, 25)

House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Independent Offices began hearings on nasa appropriations for FY 1964. nasa Administrator James E. Webb said in opening statement before the executive meeting: “I urge that your Committee approve the total amount of appropriations authorized. I should like to point out that even if the full amount requested by the President were authorized and appropriated, we face in these funds and in the plants of the contractors a similar situation to that with our own Centers where they requested 2,000 more people than we were able to approve under the budget restriction. In our manned space program we will be short between one hundred and two hundred million dollars out of the three billion dollars requested by the President. We are prepared to operate with a tight belt, we are prepared to operate without contingencies. However, I do want to point out to the Committee that we are still going to have a serious problem if we encounter any major difficulties in the form of a catastrophe on the launching pad or with a test station. “I should also like to say to the Committee that after the Authorization Bill has been enacted and after the Appropriations Bill has been passed, we are going to prepare an over-all operating plan. We plan to show it to both the House and Senate Space Committees and we will be happy to show it to the Appropriations Committees. With this re-examination and the basis for committing the funds actually appropriated, we will be in a position where we will know what our situation is and whether we will have to ask for a supplemental appropriation . . . .” (Testimony, nasa Leg.

Testimony of Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara before House Committee on Armed Services Feb. 2 was released, in which Secretary McNamara said: “A substantial amount of funds [for FY 1964] is requested for dyna-soar. I mention this only to say . . . that technology as it applies to space advances so rapidly that we must expect many changes in programs before they are completed. I personally believe that rather substantial changes lie ahead of us in this dyna-soar. “I say this, in part, because of the gemini development, gemini is a satellite project carried on up to the present time by nasa, on which has been spent to date about $300 million, and for which they will request $300 million in 1964, toward a total program cost of $800 million; it will provide a capsule capable of carrying two men into earth orbit . . . . “gemini is a competitive development with dyna-soar in the sense that each of them are [sic] designed to provide low earth orbit manned flight with controlled re-entry, dyna-soar does it one way, and with flexibility, and gemini another .... “[The nasa-dod Project Gemini joint planning committee] . . . will insure that the military requirement for near-earth orbit is properly taken account of in the gemini project. “We don’t have any clear military requirement, or any known military requirement, per se. But 1 think we do have a requirement for environmental testing and experimentation in nearearth orbit. “We are very much interested, therefore, in the Gemini project. When we become more familiar with it and understand its potential I suspect it will have a great influence on the future of DYNA-SOAR .... “I guess that we will find that gemini has a greater military potential for us, even though a rather ill-defined military potential, than does dyna-soar, and, moreover, that it will be available much sooner than dyna-soar ....	' “I think the dyna-soar project can work out satisfactorily. The real question is, what do we have when we finish it. It will cost to complete, in total, including funds spent to date, something on the order of $800 million to a billion dollars. The question is, do we meet a rather ill-defined military requirement better by proceeding down that track, or do we meet it better bv modifying gemini in some joint project with nasa . . . .” (Hearings on H.R. 2440, pp. 465-67) During March: Space Orientation Center, designed for briefing Marshall Space Flight Center visitors and new employees and operated by the Historical Office, was opened at msfc.

A change in the political climate in the last few months had nasa in trouble on its fifth anniversary, according to John Finney of the New York Times: The trouble really began when scientists began to question the validity of the manned lunar landing. “The approach being urged by the scientific critics is a step-by-step program calling first for lunar investigation by instruments and then a manned program that would not divert resources from other fields of scientific research.” It was this apnroach that was being followed until May 1961, when President Kennedy declared the high priority goal of a manned lunar landing in this decade. “Increasingly, the attack on the space budget is taking on a partisan tinge, and the Administration in turn is reacting m a partisan manner.

Webb said the 1970 target date for landing a man on the moon could not be met unless Congress restored the $250 million cut, either by putting it back now or by approving a supplemental request in Jan. 1964. Furthermore, Webb said, the FY 1965 budget would have to make up the “shortfall” from the original Administration request for $5.7 billion. Rep.

Halaby told aiaa meeting in Los Angeles: “First, technically, a superior supersonic transport is feasible. “Second, it is an expensive aircraft to develop, but not fantastically so, and certainly not beyond the resources of the greatest industrialized nation in the world. “Third, there is a market for an American transport of perhaps 200 to 250 first-round orders. If we do not develop an American sst, then the entire market, which could be something like 400 planes during perhaps a decade of first-round buying, will fall to our overseas competitors. Among the purchasers would be the airlines of the U.S., which would be forced to purchase planes produced overseas in order to remain competitive. “Fourth, in the event that we did not proceed with sst development, the Nation would default its position of preeminence in international commercial aviation—with all that would entail in practical terms and in less measurable terms of confidence and prestige . . . .” (Text)

In an article in the September issue of Aerospace magazine, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson pointed out some of the many advantages to be gained from the lunar project: “. . . The lunar project has forced us to develop many competences which have military as well as non-military significance. These are competences which we would have been slow to develop were it not for this national moon objective. For example, rendezvous technique so basic to our moon project is essential to detecting and examining other spacecraft which may be hostile. Life protective measures are essential to a useful police force in space for maintaining the peace. Powerful rockets, reliability of space equipment, development of control and guidance systems, experience with manned spacecraft, etc., are all spin-offs from the lunar project, which help build our defense capability.” (Text, Aerospace, Sept. 1963)

Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, speaking editorially in Astronautics arid Aerospace Engineering magazine, April 1963, emphasized that: “As satellites extend man’s vision into new dimensions, weather forecasting will make major advances as a science, until we see reliable predictions a season ahead. “This will have far-reaching economic benefits for all. Following are some estimates of cost-savings, assuming that we can predict weather accurately only five days in advance: $2% billion a year in agriculture; $45 million in the lumber industry; $100 million in surface transportation; $75 million in retail marketing; and $3 billion in water-resources management. These estimates of savings are for just the United States. Worldwide benefits would be many times as great.” (A&AE, Apr., 1963)

Welsh, Executive Secretary of nasc. reviewed the national objectives in space: “First of all, there is an over-all policy objective, which the President has expressed as the determination of this country ‘to become the world’s leading space-faring nation.’ It is worth mentioning that this is a broad umbrella. . . . Suffice to say that the space program is not a one-project design nor a short-run episode. It is a growing, expanding, multi-project program, which I predict will become an increasingly significant part of our way of life. As important as it is, the moon project is not the whole space program; it is just one portion and one phase of an over-all program which has breadth through variety and depth far into the future. “A few features of this broad space policy are: “1. Its objectives are peaceful . . . the distinction as to what is peaceful and what is not peaceful is a matter of intent and is not determined by what agency of the government engages in them .... “2. Our policy asserts that space travel and space exploration are subject to international law and that such activity should be consistent with the provisions of the United Nations charter. . . . “3. It is our policy to seek increased international cooperation in, and mutually advantageous agreements for, the orderly and open conduct of space and space related activities .... “4. It is also our policy that the concept and performance of our space responsibilities shall be maintained and strengthened as a national program rather than a series of separate and unrelated projects. . . . “5. There are inherent risks in space exploration, particularly in manned flight, and they must be recognized .... “6. While we must continue to improve on state-of-the-art competences, it is essential that we strive just as hard to make so-called quantum jumps in technology and performance .... “7. It is a significant element of policy that progress be the joint product of government and private enterprise. . . . “In conclusion, the national space program is an essential and dynamic feature of our economy. It benefits the many rather than the few. It strengthens the nation, both at home and abroad. It looks forward rather than backward. It highlights the contributions of the most able technologists and the most able managers and gives them an unprecedented peacetime opportunity to repay more fully the special bonus they have received by living in this great country. “We can afford the space program. We must afford it. We can be satisfied with nothing less than first place—to the moon, to the planets, and throughout the solar system.” (Text)
Sen. A. S. Monronev (D.-Okla.), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation of the Senate Commerce Committee, speaking at the Air Transport Association Engineering and Maintenance Conference in Washington, said that the Government’s plan of cost sharing for the development of the supersonic transport aircraft ($1 billion, the U.S. putting up %, the aviation industry the other y4) was “a firm figure that must be considered final .... “I am afraid that many of our finest businessmen still hope to consider this project in the nature of a defense contract. This effort must stand alone as a civil aviation need . . . .” The Senator did concede that if the market turned out to be for 100 aircraft instead of 200, the Government “might be able to give the companies some bail-out on this.” (NYT, 10/81/63, 58)
House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Applications and Tracking and Data Acquisition resumed hearings on nasa FY 1964 budget authorization, with testimony by Dr. Joseph V.

Asked whether ComSat Corp. would conduct its own r&d or depend upon NASA-sponsored research, Mr. Welch said, “We plan to do both. We plan to contract for design studies, [and] we obviously plan to take advantage of the work done by nasa.” Mr. Welch said space communications system may link U.S., Europe, Japan, and Latin America by 1967. Dr. Charyk said ComSatCorp. expected initial planning to take about a year and development of hardware about another three years, (nasa Leg. Act. Rpt. 11/63; AP, Wash. Eve.

John L. Sloop, Director of nasa Propulsion and Power Generation in Office of Advanced Research and Technology, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Advanced Research and Technology: “Propulsion is the key to space exploration and our push to the moon in this decade will depend completely on chemical propulsion. We see a large and continuing role for chemical propulsion in the next decade. The advent of nuclear and electrical propulsion will greatly increase our capability and enable us to use each type in the application best suited to its characteristics. We see much larger chemical propulsion systems than we have today. Some of these may use air augmentation and will be capable of ferrying large payloads economically from earth to manned satellites and between distant points on the earth. We see chemical propulsion packages carried dormant for months on long space missions but ready at the touch of a button or a signal from earth to perform their task. We see chemical propulsion systems for landing and take-off from the moon, Mars, and Venus where compact systems of high thrust per pound of weight are needed. Some may be carried as extra stored energy sources for emergency use . . . .” (Testimony)
nasa Administrator James E.

nasa testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations on Aug. 19,1963, indicated that at that time nasa officials saw little prospect for U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in manned lunar exploration, William Hines, of the Washington Evening Star, quoted from testimony released today. Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator and chief U.S. space negotiator, said: “In my discussions with Blagonravov, the question of cooperation in manned space flights was mentioned in the early part, but was pretty well dropped as something that was not practical . . .” because among other reasons, of “the very high degree of classification the Russians attached to their space program. . . .” Summing up, Dr. Dryden said: “I do not foresee in the near future any prospects that the Russians, any more than ourselves, will see a clear way to co-operate in a manned lunar landing.” nasa Administrator James E. Webb agreed: “Up to now, there has been no evidence whatever that we will gain anything significant from it.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 10/7/63)
Hearings on nasa budget authorization for FY 1964 began before House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Administrator James E. Webb repeated President Kennedy’s declaration of the national goal of making the U.S. “the world’s leading spacefaring nation” and achieving for the U.S. “a position of pre-eminence” in space. Mr. Webb testified: “The mastery of space, and its utilization for the benefit of mankind, will not be determined by any single achievement. Superiority in the space environment with its great advantages and benefits will be won and very likely can be held by that nation which first fashions into a usable system all of the scientific knowledge, all of the technology, all of the experience, all of the space launch and terminal facilities, and all of the aids to space navigation required for safety and regular services. “These are the capabilities and resources which the United States must have, and this budget is designed to make rapid progress toward acquiring them. “moving from our present position to achieve mastery of space requires that we add substant ially to our scientific knowledge and to our utilization of technology. The nasa program is progressing on both of these fronts. In a complex effort such as this, conducted in a new medium about which much is yet unknown, the scientists and the engineer inevitably must work closely together and grow increasingly dependent upon one another. . . . “The nasa program, therefore, is designed to expand both science and technology. We are moving forward on a broad front. We have avoided becoming trapped in a narrow program—one limited, for example, to developing only the technology needed to reach the moon with state-of-the-art hardware. To do so might well be to find, some years hence, that we had won the battle and lost the war as far as ultimate and enduring superiority in space is concerned. . . .” (Testimony)
nasa Director of Meteorological Systems Morris Tepper told House Committee on Scieiice and Astronautics that tiros v and tiros vi (launched in June and Sept. 1962 respectively) were still providing good data. Tiros data “continue to be used by the Weather Bureau for weather analysis and forecasting, storm tracking, hurricane reconnaissance, etc. The Weather Bureau disseminates its analyses and warnings widely .... “The Meteorological Soundings project has continued throughout the year as planned. The project at Goddard Space Flight Center which utilizes the larger meteorological sounding rockets continues as it has in past years with excellent results. In addition, we have initiated at the Langley Research Center a project which will develop and utilize the smaller meteorological sounding rockets. We expect to have this well underway by the end of this Fiscal Year . . . .” (Testimony)
Alton B. Moody, Chief of Future Aplications Satellites in nasa Office of Applications, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Applications and Tracking and Data Acquisition. He summarized nasa accomplishments and plans in two areas—navigation satellite systems and data collection satellite systems—and said: “Both of these projects illustrate the operating procedure adopted for Future Applications. Before a flight program will be undertaken, several questions must be answered affirmatively: “1. Is there a requirement? “2. Is the requirement sufficient to justify the expenditure of the funds needed? “3. How would such a system operate? “4. Is the design feasible and within current state-of-the-art? By answering these questions serially, we are not committing funds very far downstream and can turn back at any point if the results are unfavorable.” (Testimony)
Senate Appropriations Committee completed action on nasa’s FY 1964 appropriation by approving a $5.19 billion nasa budget.

Aside from these demonstrations, which have public appeal, and are necessary to show that our satellites perform as we say they do, hundreds of engineering tests have been performed, the results of which will enable the United States to design better satellites and ground stations for an operational, global communications satellite system. In addition, we have accumulated a considerable amount of radiation data, and have obtained better information on the damage to solid state components, such as solar cells, transistors and diodes, from which we will profit in the design of all kinds of satellites in the future . . . .” (Testimony)
Dr. Frederick Seitz, President of the National Academy of Science, was the opening witness in hearings on the Government’s role as a patron of science and technology, conducted by the subcommittee on Science, Research and Development of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Dr. Seitz said that the period of almost unlimited growth of Federal investment in science and technology was coming to an end, would have to level off and force some “hard decisions” on choices, and expressed the fear that basic science would suffer in competition with more glamorous hardware projects. For the most part he thought U.S. science wras well ahead of Russia, but noted remarkable progress on the part of West Germany and Japan. (Finney, NYT, 10/16/63)

House passed H.R. 8747, the Independent Offices Appropriations for FY 1964, which included the $5.1 billion for nasa recommended by the Appropriations Committee. Among the amendments accepted was one which would require Senate approval of any agreement that would use nasa funds in support of joint lunar exploration with Communist countries. Among amendments rejected were ones which would have (1) reduced nasa r&d funds by another $700 million and set limitations of $597,400,000 on Project Apollo and $124,400,000 on lunar and planetary exploration; (2) deleted the facility construction funds for the proposed nasa electronics center ($3,990,000); and (3) reduced the amount for development of a supersonic transport aircraft from $60 million to $500,000. An involved debate preceded passage of the bill, most of it concerned with the nasa program. Rep. Clarence Cannon (D-Mo.), Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, was one of those opposing passage of the nasa funding. He argued that “the appropriation reported out by the committee has been provided largely because of commitments. It is impossible to escape the conviction that the project [manned lunar landing] must eventually be abandoned.” Rep. Albert Thomas (D.-Tex.) led the support of the nasa program, arguing that the nasa budget had already been cut $1.1 billion from that ($6.2 billion) originally presented by nasa to the Bureau of the Budget. Another in support of the nasa appropriation was Rep. George W. Andrews (D-Ala.), who read into the record a letter from Dr. Wemher von Braun, Director of msfc. Dr. von Braun argued that a program as big and complex and with such long lead times as the space program must have sustained, consistent support year after year. He stated that of the various major expenditures—rockets, capsules, facilities, etc.— only the Lunar Excursion Module was being designed principally for the manned lunar landing. “All other elements of these programs create what we as a nation most urgently need independent of our lunar landing effort: A national manned spacefaring capability, to sail the new ocean, as the President said.” (67?, 10/10/63, 18260-18309)

Addressing National Rocket Club in Washington, Rep. George P. Miller, Chairman of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said: “To me, the most important indirect benefit we are gaining [from the space program] is probably the least tangible, the least measurable, and yet the most far reaching in effect insofar as our future national growth is concerned. I am referring to the impact our space program is having upon our educational programs and institutions. The fact that NASA places demands upon and draws from almost every academic discipline has produced a stimulus in universities and colleges that is unprecedented in peacetime .... “What is important to understand is that scientific research and development is for the first time in our peacetime history being organized within one agency to accomplish a national goal. The achievements of our immediate space objectives are, of course, of paramount importance. But, I have little patience with the critics who cry out that our tax money is being thrown away in the exploration of space, or that going to the moon will result in the neglect of our problems here on earth. “It should be obvious to those critics, if they take the time for a short historical review, that many years of experience have shown that the indirect payoff in human terms for technical innovation is many times more valuable than the original investment . . . .” (Text)

This agreement represents another important example of the manner in which both the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are striving to maximize the technological productivity of national space flight programs such as the Gemini. I think it is significant that in announcing the agreement, Mr. McNamara and Mr. Webb emphasized the national character and importance of the Gemini project and reiterated their intentions to insure that Gemini is utilized in the national interest and to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort in this area as in all others .... “I think it is important to point out here that increased dod participation in the Gemini does not alter the peaceful and experimental character of the program. We are driving forward to advance the technology of manned space flight, including rendezvous and designated docking and to study and understand man’s effectiveness under prolonged conditions of weightlessness.

Anderson (D.-N.M.), Chairman of Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, said in television interview that “with very good luck” the U.S. could land a man on the moon by 1968 or 1969, but he personally thought U.S. lunar landing would be in early 1970’s. Senator Anderson said he doubted reports that U.S.S.R. was not racing U.S. to the moon. (cbs-TV “Washington Reports,” AP, Wash. Eve. Star, 8/12/63)_	_	_ _
National Science Foundation appropriations of $323 million were voted by the House Appropriations Committee, a cut of $265 million from the $589 million requested by the Administration. No funds were approved for new programs. Specifically eliminated were two new programs to improve the Nation’s scientific manpower by (1) encouraging new “centers of scientific excellence” in universities that had unrealized potential, and (2) encouraging more students to go into engineering, mathematics, and physical science. {NYT, 10/8/63, 26)
House Committee on Science and Astronautics cut $95.5 million from nasa proposed FY 1964 budget, based upon recommendation of Committee’s Subcommittee on Applications and Tracking and Data Acquisition. Today’s reduction brought Committee’s total reduction to $488.88 million, cutting requested $5,712 billion authorization to $5,223 billion. (NYT, 7/10/63, 12; upi, Wash. Post, 7/10/63)
Fifth anniversary of first U.S. satellite, explorer i. Also fifth anniversary of activation of U.S. tracking network to track explorer i: at the time, network included Vanguard’s Minitrack stations located primarily in Western Hemisphere. Since that time, other networks were added to form truly worldwide tracking network and data acquisition system for satellites and space probes launched by U.S.: Minitrack network; Deep Space Instrumentation Facilities; Manned Space Flight Network; Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s Baker-Nunn Telescope-Camera Network. Ceremonies at nasa Goddard Space Flight Center featured talks by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, nasa Administrator James E. Webb, and Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr. Radio transmissions from vanguard i, second U.S. satellite and oldest U.S. satellite still transmitting, were heard during tour of Goddard facilities following formal ceremonies. Highlighting occasion was presentation of scrolls of appreciation to ambassadors of 16 nations that have cooperated with U.S. in establishing the international tracking networks. Field reports indicated that in at least 12 countries related special events and ceremonies were held on the same day as Goddard observances. Countries reporting special activities included Argentina, Australia, Bermuda, Brazil, Ecuador, Great Britain, India, Iran, The Netherlands, Nigeria, Peru, and Spain, (nasa Release 63-10; upi, Wash. Post, 1/27/63, A6; State Dept., usia Field Reports—per AI/Robinson) January 31: At ceremonies commemorating Fifth Anniversary of Tracking at nasa Goddard Space Flight Center, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Chairman of National Aeronautics and Space Council, said in remarks delivered by nasc Executive Secretary Edward C. Welsh: “. . . I would like to quote briefly from the report drafted by the Senate Committee [on Aeronautics and Space Sciences] before the passage of the [National Aeronautics and Space] Act: “. . .‘Space neither invites nor necessitates any re-definition of American goals and aims. Throughout our history, it has been the goal of peace and liberty that has led Americans to explore the dimensions of challenging frontiers. Our goal now remains unchanged.’ “I have chosen this paragraph to quote because it is basic to our national philosophy. In space activitieSj the lines of demarcation that so often separate nations in their purposes would seem to be petty. Interchange and cooperation in the exploration of a realm as vast as the solar system—indeed, the universe—should lead to better understanding among nations . . . .” (Text)
Article by nasa scientists Dr. Homer E. Newell and Dr. Robert Jastrow in Atlantic Monthly inserted in Congressional Record by Sen. Clinton P. Anderson, Chairman of Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Replying to scientists critical of pace set for landing men on the moon, the authors said: “This question requires a further exploration of the motives underlying the U.S. space effort. Is it primarily a scientific program, or is it motivated by a broader concern with the national interest ? Looking back to the overwhelming support given the new space program by the Congress in 1961, it seems clear that this support was not tendered for scientific reasons primarily, but came from a deep-seated conviction that the expanded program will make an important contribution to our future strength and security. We believe that this is the reason why the people have supported the enlarged space program. That brings us to the point on which we take issue with some of our scientific colleagues, who complain, ‘The scientific exploration of the moon has been accorded a secondary priority in the lunar program.’ This remark is based on the premise that science should have top priority in the space program. However, while science plays an important role in lunar exploration, it was never intended to be the primary Objective of that project. The impetus of the lunar project is derived from its place in the long-range U.S. program for the exploration of the solar system. The heart of that program is man in space, the extension of man’s control over his physical environment. The science and technology of space flight are ancillary developments which support the main thrust of manned exploration, while at the same time they bring valuable returns to our economy and our culture. The science which we do in space provides the equivalent of the gold and spices recovered from earlier voyages of exploration. It is the return to the taxpayer for his investment in his nation’s future. But the driving force of the program is not in scientific research alone, valuable though that may be in the long run. Thus, the pace of the program must be set, not by the measured patterns of scientific research, but by the need for a vigorous response to the national challenge . . . .” (Text, CR, 7/31/63, A4874-76)
At nasa Budget Briefing Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans commented on rumor that nasa planned another Mercury flight after the Cooper flight scheduled for April: “You will note that the Mercury and one-day [manned orbital] effort is presumed to be completed in fiscal ’64. We have a flight scheduled for this April. ... In planning flights of that importance we always have a back-up possibility. We do have two back-up capsules as well as the two back-up Atlas boosters that could be used in the event that we don’t obtain all the information that we anticipate obtaining in the Cooper flight. . . .” (nasa Budget Briefing FY 1964 Transcript, 1/17/63)
President Kennedy visited San Antonio and Houston. In San Antonio, he participated in the dedication of the new $6-million Aerospace Medical Health Center at Brooks afb. “Too many Americans make the mistake of assuming that space research has no value here on earth. Nothing could be further from the truth,” the President said, and then went on to enumerate some of the advances in medical science and technique that had come from space research. Referring to the reduced nasa budget passed by the Senate the previous day, the President said: “There will be pressures for our country to do less and temptations to do something else. But this research must and will go ahead. That much we know. That much we can say with confidence and conviction .... “Our effort in space is not, as some have suggested, a competitor for the national resources needed to improve our living standards. It is instead a working partner and coproducer of those resources.” (Wicker, NTT, 11/22/63; Kiker, N.Y. Herald Tribune, 11/22/63)
Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson defended the space program as a major bulwark of U.S. posture. In a speech to the Massachusetts Associated Industries in Boston, the Vice President said: “If we want to maintain the credibility of our claim to the superiority of a free political system—and a free private enterprise system— we cannot seriously entertain the thought of precipitating now so massive a disillusionment as would follow a political default on our commitments in space exploration.” (AP, Wash. Post, 10/25/63)
House Resolution 504 to create a select committee to investigate expenditures for research programs conducted by or sponsored by departments and agencies of the Federal Government was reported to House floor from House Committee on Rules. (CR, 8/28/63, 15297-98)
In letter to Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D.-N.M.), Chairman of Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R.-Me.), ranking minority member, recommended the committee carefully re-examine U.S. space activities and resource allocations “because I think the priority given the manned lunar program is inure of an issue now than it was 2 years ago .... “It is interesting to note that criticisms expressed concerning the allocation of funds within the space budget, and the amount of the total budget, are coming from members of both political parties as well as from some scientists and engineers who are not identified with either party. “I do not, therefore, regard nasa’s budget for fiscal 1964 as a partisan matter . . . .” (Letter, 5/10/63, m CR, 5/13/63, 7803)
Aviation executives criticized Government plans for the supersonic transport in testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Aviation. C. R. Smith, president of American Airlines, objected to the provision that industry pay one quarter of the development costs, wanted Government to pay all the costs and defer decision on how to recapture some of the costs until after the prototype had flown. John Stack, vice president and director of engineering of Republic Aviation Corp. and former nasa Director of Aeronautical Research, complained that competition with the British-French Concorde would force U.S. industry to set up management and assembly lines prematurely. Stack urged that a manufacturer be chosen to begin work on a prototype next spring and that the one-year-long second design phase be eliminated. He also supported the steel-and-titanium mach 3 concept as more efficient than an aluminum mach 2 + aircraft presently favored by faa. (Clark, NYT, 10/23/63, 9)
nasa Administrator James E. Webb issued statement to press: “The record shows that Congress has consistently taken the necessary action to support the space program, and I am confident that this Congress will continue this record. Although the report of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics is a major milestone on the road to approval of the 1964 nasa Budget, it is still too early in the consideration of this budget by Congress to draw firm conclusions as to what the final result will be. The House subcommittees have given the nasa programs a most careful review, accumulating data from hearings which will total more than 4,000 pages of testimony. Their devotion and attention to details has been impressive, but in my opinion the overall result of their actions is an inadequate level of support for a program that is urgently needed, has achieved a high level of success, and is now giving this nation the promise of early preeminence in all phases of space exploration and use. In the areas reduced, nasa will present a strong case for restoration as the legislation proceeds to enactment. “After its many details were brought under close scrutiny, and the possibility of postponement of many of these examined, the Committee has endorsed the program and the way it is being carried out but decided to defer approval until subsequent budgets in a number of important areas. My view is that the necessary resources should be authorized this year, rather than have important segments postponed with the consequent introduction of uncertainty at many levels in the government-industry -university team now engaged in this urgent national effort. “At the reduced level of funding recommended, we will certainly have to slow up or postpone a number of programs and direct a reduction in the scheduled level of effort in the plants of our contractors where 90% of the work of the space program is done. Unless an adequate level of support is restored, momentum already attained with great effort and difficulty will be lost and the stretch-out required will add to the final cost of the work required to carry out the program.” (Statement)
President Kennedy transmitted to Congress the 1962 report on UJS. Aeronautics and Space Activities, stating in Preface: “The year 1962 was a period of acceleration, accomplishment, and relative progress for the United States in its space leadership drive. In both numbers and complexity of space projects, the past year was the most successful in our brief but active space history.” In accompanying message, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson told Congress that, during 1962, U.S. “generated a greater rate of progress in space than did the U.S.S.R. [However] . . . the records of the two countries were closely similar in regard to the ratio of space successes to space failures.” (Annual Report for 1962; L.A. Times, Wash. Post, 1/29/63, A2)
John L. Sloop, Director of Propulsion and Power Generation in nasa Office of Advanced Research and Technology, testified on nasa high-energy propellant program before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight: “Our interest in high energy propellants dates back to the middle-forties. A large amount of research on high energy propellants was conducted by naca. This research contributed to the development of the RL-10 engine. It also led to the choice of oxygen-hydrogen for the upper stages of Saturn I and Saturn V . . . . “Let me assure you, however, that we are not thinking or dealing in the past. I firmly believe there are many opportunities ahead to use high energy propellants in space exploration .... One phase of high energy propellant research in the 1953-1959 period is just beginning to reach fruition and offers significant potential gams in payload for existing vehicles and future vehicles. More work remains to be done . . . .” (Testimony)
Brig. Gen. Charles H. Roadman (usaf) , nasa Director of Aerospace Medicine, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics' Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight. Replying to press criticism of nasa plans to use pure oxygen in Project Gemini spacecraft, General Roadman said: “. . . in our investigations to date we have no physiological information that would permit us to say that 100% oxygen from a physiological standpoint is contraindicated in a two-week mission. This is not to say that there are not many physiologists who would like more information concerning 100% oxygen over a time period, which we thoroughly support . . . .” (Transcript) nasa Administrator James E. Webb, in keynote address May 6, cited recommendation by Iowa Summer Study that one or more scientists be included in Project Apollo lunar flights: “To those who have the responsibility for success in reaching the moon, it has appeared that the nature of the Apollo effort requires the training of astronauts who have substantial experience as test pilots in high speed jet aircraft, and to the extent possible engineering training as well. “Meanwhile, it is apparent that the view of the scientists that trained scientific personnel should participate is valid, and that at the earliest appropriate stage in the program scientists will be included on Apollo missions. So far as we can now tell we are obligated to utilize astronauts with the maximum of test-flight experience and highly conditioned reflexes on the first flight of the most difficult of all undertakings. Should training and experience in intermediate flights indicate otherwise we will, of course, take this into consideration in determining the stage of development in manned space flight at which a scientist-astronaut will directly participate. “In its effort to insure maximum scientific benefit from the manned space flight program nasa is doing several things: “First, manned space flights are being used to take scientific measurements in order that they will provide results beyond crew training and technological experience. “Second, efforts have already begun to provide scientific training for the present group of astronauts including geological field trips to enhance their capacity for scientific observation. “Third, a manned space science working group has been established [within nasa] .... This group is already at work in the planning of a program for training scientists for space flight . . . .’’ (Text) Dr. David H. Stoddard, Assistant Director of Medical Operations in nasa Office of Manned Space Flight, discussed human factors in manned space flight and said “we are confident that the biomedical needs of our currently approved manned space flight program can be met from within the scope of our existing technology.” (Text) Dr. Joseph F. Shea, Deputy Director for Systems in nasa Office of Manned Space Flight, reviewed U.S. manned space flight program. Describing Project Gemini, he said:	. . the Gemini is more than an experimental spacecraft. At the end of its scheduled developmental flight program, it will be available for missions ranging from scientific and engineering experiments to the ferrying of astronauts to and from a permanent space laboratory. The end goal of Gemini is, therefore, an operational spacecraft which can be launched by relatively small boosters. We expect Gemini to be a useful space vehicle for several years .... The Gemini spacecraft will reach operational status by 1966 . . . .” (Text)	. Capt. Robert F. Freitag (usn), Director of Launch Vehicles and Propulsion in nasa Office of Manned Space Flight, said: “The nation’s program to achieve pre-eminence in space and to insure that, the United States occupies first place among the nations of this world in science, in technology and in conquest of space is critically dependent on the power of the rocket. “You may have heard much about the ‘booster gap’ and the effect this situation has had on our position vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union started well ahead of us in the development of large rockets, so necessary for manned flight. The Soviets have been ahead of us, and are still ahead of us in their ability to launch reliably large masses to Earth orbit. “However, with the acceleration of our own progress and by the establishment of our program on a sound engineering basis we can, we believe, surpass the Soviets in time and clearly establish and demonstrate United States pre-eminence in manned space flight. . . .” (Text) Reviewing nasa space program, Director of nasa Office of Programs D. D. Wyatt said: “In its broadest context the nasa program can be classified into three complementary parts. First, we have those phases of the program which are aimed at the exploration of the very nature of space .... “The second major element of our program is aimed at the earliest practical utilization of space for the benefit of mankind .... “Complementing our programs to understand and define space is a third major program element aimed at developing and improving the highly complex technologies which will enhance our future capabilities in space . . . .” (Text) John E. Naugle, Director of nasa Geophysics and Astronomy Programs, said: “. . . the scientific program which we have in nasa is a logical extension of the research work which has been underway in laboratories on the earth since the time of Galileo. Just as astronomers once carried their telescopes to the top of a mountain to see better, now we carry telescopes beyond the earth on rockets and satellites. By doing this we see entirely new phenomena and enable scientists to broaden their studies in certain scientific disicplines . . . .” He then discussed scientific results from each of the six scientific satellites launched by nasa since beginning of 1962 (oso i, explorer xiv, explorer xv, alouette i, ariel, and explorer xvii).	(Text) nasa Director of International Programs Arnold W. Frutkin said in May 7 address delivered by J. H. Barnes, nasa Chief of Cooperative Programs, Office of International Programs: “What other nations are doing in space and in particular, what they are doing together, is in fact small when compared with the resources going directly into national programs in the US and the ussr. Yet, what has been accomplished provides substantial evidence of the feasibility, the benefits, and the promise of joint action by the nations in this new field . . . .” (Text) Edgar M. Cortright, Deputy Director of nasa Office of Space Sciences, described scientific spacecraft now under development, and said: “We must continually assess our progress .... The flight performance of our spacecraft has been increasing dramatically .... The useful life of unmanned spacecraft launched in 1962 has exceed six months and is still rising because most of those intended for long life are still operating successfully. “Our progress with launch vehicles has been equally gratifying. In 1962, 82% of all major nasa launchings were successful. This performance has been paced by the remarkable Thor-Delta which has successfully launched 16 out of 17 spacecraft. In addition, the huge Saturn has scored 4 out of 4 perfect flights. During this time period, both the Thor-Delta and the Scout payloads were increased over 60% at no increase in their $2.5 million and $1 million price tags. These dramatic increases in performance, life, and reliability of spacecraft and launch vehicles represent by far the most effective way to achieve economy in the space program . . . .” (Text) nasa Director of Advanced Research and Technology Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff said: “There are four principal areas where a continuing and driving program of advanced research is required if this nation is to achieve pre-eminence in aeronautical and space activities in the decades to come. These are energy conversion and propulsion; materials and structures; control, guidance and communications; and space sciences and the environment of space.” (Text) Louis B. C. Fong, Director of nasa Office of Technology Utilization, said on May 8 that the “basic objectives of the [nasa] Technology Utilization Program are:
nasa announced rca Service Co. had been selected to negotiate contract for operation and maintenance of satellite data-acquisition stations—two near Rosman, N.C., and two near Fairbanks, Alaska. One station at each location would be operational by Sept. 1963; other two stations were expected to be operational m 1964. Facilities would be first high-capacity data-acquisition stations, supporting Oao, Pogo, Ego, and Nimbus satellites, (nasa Release 63-138). ■June 19: nasa Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden received international aspects of the U.S. space program at a luncheon meeting of the National Capitol Section of the aiaa. Dr. Dryden was awarded the First Annual von Karman Memorial Citation and a letter from Vice President Johnson was read which said, in part: “A few more Hugh Diydens—appropriately placed about the globe—and we would have a world of peace, honor, and progress.” Preceding Dr. Dryden’s address Mr. Robert F. Packard of the State Department reviewed U.S. policy with regard to space. (Letter; Citation; Text)
Editorial in Washington Evening Star quoted Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson:“. . . To reach the moon is a risk. But it is a risk we must take . . . [for] failure to go into space is even riskier .... Where the moon is a major goal today, it will be tomorrow a mere whistle stop for the space traveler.” Editorial cited “soundness of what he has had to say about our projected lunar voyages . . .” and added: “The warning is well-timed, especially so because of what some otherwise sensible and perceptive people have been saying about the alleged nonsensicality of flying to the moon when the money could be better spent on such urgent projects as building schools, sewage plants and more and more highways right down here on earth.

Rep. George P. Miller (D.-Calif.), Chairman of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, reviewed Centaur development in speech on the House floor: “. . . Centaur began as a low-priority, financially austere feasibility study, in competition with high-priority defense programs. As its importance to the national space effort became more apparent, its terms of reference were changed; and, as time passed, its inherent technical difficulties came to the surface; technical difficulties, I might add, that we have learned to expect in most new programs. “Certainly, the original flight schedule of Centaur was overly optimistic. Hindsight also tells us that the complexity of the program was greatly underestimated . . . .” Referring to press articles charging $100 million was wasted in Centaur program, based on gao investigative report, Rep. Miller pointed out: “That report was misinterpreted by the press, and a closer look at it will reveal that no such conclusion was drawn by the Comptroller General. The alleged $100 million waste included $76 million reportedly lost in Hie Advent project, the military communications satellite project .... “While there can be no doubt that certain programs incurred losses because of the unavailability of Centaur on schedule, it is incorrect and unfair to attribute the entire unrecoverable loss associated with the Advent program to Centaur, as the press apparently did. Suffice it to say that the Advent project had its own severe management and technical difficulties which led to its cancellation in June 1962.” He called the Nov. 27 flight test of AC-2 “a significant advance in the development of a new technology upon which much of America’s future space effort depends . . . .”	(67?, 12/2/63, 21906 ff.)
Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D.-N.M.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, wrote a letter to nasa Administrator James E. Webb asking for an explanation of the statements made at the summary conference on Project Mercury that there had been poor workmanship on the Mercury spacecraft, according to William Hines, in the Washington Evening Star. He was also reported to have inquired about a remark attributed to Dr. Robert Gilruth, Director of msc, that industrial shortcomings included outright falsification, citing an instance where a component used “ ‘black iron where there Should have been stainless steel.’ ” (Hines, Wash.

Memorandum titled “Space Race with U.S.S.R.” from Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of National Aeronautics and Space Council, to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, was made public. Dr. Welsh said U.S. space program was in the building stage this year and few space spectaculars could be expected in 1963; U.S.S.R. may attempt the following in 1963: manned orbital mission of eight days, manned orbital rendezvous mission, close-up photographs of planet Mars (with mars i probe), and several unmanned lunar soft-landing probes. Memorandum had been written before launching of Soviet probe lunik, iv, believed by many scientists to have been an unsuccessful attempt to soft-land on the moon. (Text; Av. Wk., 4/15/63, 38)
Proposal by nbc to television industry to televise Astronaut Gordon Cooper’s Mercury flight MA-9 in color would not be adopted, Executive Vice President of nbc News William R. MeAndrew acknowledged. Proposal had been rejected, science reporter William Hines said, in February by officials of abc and cbs networks, but nasa had been quietly trying to persuade them to accept the proposal.

President Kennedy sent FY 1964 Budget Request to Congress, recommending nasa appropriation of $5,712 billion. Of this sum, $3.19 billion was for manned space flight, with Project Apollo receiving largest single increase in nasa budget—from $435 million in FY 1963 to $1.2 billion in FY 1964. nasa Administrator James E. Webb characterized the budget request as “austere”—it would neither speed up nor slow down the National effort to land an American on the moon in this decade. Total FY 1964 space budget, was estimated at $7,614 billion— nasa, $5,664 billion; dod $1,668 billion; aec, $254.3 million; Weather Bureau, $26.2 million; and National Science Foundation, $2.3 million, (nasa Budget Briefing FY 1964; Wash.

D. Brainerd Holmes, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator and Director of Manned Space Flight, said in testimony before House Committee on Science and Astronautics: “. . . The past year has been an exceedingly active one for our manned space flight program. It was not only the year for accomplishments both in Project Mercury and in the initial Saturn test flights, but it was also a year for decisions in the rest of our program. “The lunar orbit rendezvous technique was selected for Project Apollo, and our preliminary program plans were translated into firm and decisive schedules. Every major hardware element has been placed under contract and construction of the required facilities is well under way. “In the current year we plan to carry forward all of the activities I have just described. By the end of this year much of the preliminary testing required in our program should have been completed and we should be well under way in the program designed to achieve not only a manned lunar landing in this decade,but also pre-eminence in manned space flight for this Nation.” (Testimony)
Dr. Lyman J. Briggs (1874-1963), Director Emeritus of the Bureau of Standards and a former member of the naca (1933-45), died in Washington, D.C. He began his government career in 1896 as a physicist in the Department of Agriculture, originating the centrifuge method of classifying soils, organizing the biophysical lab in 1906. He joined the Bureau of Standards in 1917 and became its Director in 1933; his early research resulted in improvement in the accuracy of large naval guns, the invention with Dr. Paul R. Heyl of the earth inductor compass (used by Lindbergh) , and air viscosity experiments leading to improved propeller designs, naca Report No. 207 by Briggs, G. F. Hall, and Hugh L. Dryden (on “Aerodynamic Characteristics of Airfoils at High Speeds,”) issued in 1924 was considered a major contribution on airfoils at near supersonic speeds. In 1939, the White House named Dr. Briggs as chairman of the original Uranium Committee to study the military use of atomic energy, which led to the Manhattan Project and Hiroshima. For his work on the proximity fuse during World War II, he was awarded the Medal of Merit by President Truman. Dr. Briggs retired in 1945, but continued research including confirmation in 1959 that pitched baseballs could curve as much as 17 inches in 60 feet. (Wash. Eve. Star, 3/2/63, A5)
James A. Van Allen, speaking at science hearing of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said: “The spectacular nature of many space achievements, especially those involving human passengers, is such that the space race stirs the enthusiasm of all but the most obtuse or superstitious persons, and makes possible widespread support by the tax-paying public.” (AP, Wash. Post, 1/23/63)
Sen. Clinton P. Anderson, Chairman of Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, inserted in Congressional Record an art'cle from Missiles and Rockets, which said: “The United States has gained more knowledge of outer space than the Russians because we’ve done a better overall job with our unmanned satellite program. We are using unmanned vehicles to help predict weather around the world, to improve navigation, to make possible international television and other communications, and to keep track of what the enemy is doing to establish missiles and other weapon systems aimed at us. “Not only have we learned more about the planet Mars through unmanned space research, but we’ve gained much knowledge of the vast reaches of space in between and beyond .... We’ve pursued unmanned space research down far more streets and alleys than have the Soviets. “For the most part, our unmanned satellites are yielding knowledge that will assure success with manned flights into space in the future. For that reason, if no other, it is easy for the unmanned satellite program to be overlooked, its significance lost in the international competition of manned flights. This is a pity, for what we do in unmanned space exploration today is the very foundation on which we will build future manned space exploration. “In saying this we are not being partisan to the claim so often heard these days that we ought to forget about the manned program and explore space only with unmanned vehicles. We regard the controversy as a mere tempest in a teapot that will prove meaningless in time . . . .” (CR, 8/20/63)

At nasa Fifth Anniversary Honor Awards Ceremony, held at Smithsonian Institution, 23 individuals were singled out for outstanding contributions to the civilian space program. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson stated that U.S. space policy was clear: “With or without cooperation from any other country, we are going to the moon, and we are going to make that trip as soon as we can. . . . We would like to do this through international cooperation. Leaders of both parties have sought cooperation under two administrations. The moon represents our major space goal for this decade, and if cooperation is possible we are willing to share this goal as well as others.” nasa Administrator James E. Webb summarized the five years of space achievements and looked ahead: “From the first two United States satellites, Explorer I and Vanguard I, launched early in 1958, we learned that the earth was slightly pear-shaped rather than being the sphere it had been thought to be. We also learned that the earth was surrounded by a zone of radiation, called the Van Allen Belt after its discoverer Dr. James Van Allen. “In addition to these first satellites of scientific significance, we have orbited highly successful weather and communication satellites, probed the area of Venus, put men into orbit and brought them safely back to earth, and sent thousands of sounding rockets into space to study the earth’s environment. From these and other experiments installed in more than 100 satellites and deep space probes, we have succeeded in vastly expanding knowledge and understanding of our own planet earth and of the solar system of which it is a part .... “Looking ahead through the remainder of this decade, we have set our sights on a truly global weather satellite system, advanced communications and navigation satellites, space observatories for astronomical and solar studies, and a manned expedition to explore the moon . . . .” Awards were presented by Mr. Webb, nasa Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L. Diyden, and Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr. Eight cash awards totaling $12,200 were divided among 14 nasa employees for inventions and scientific and technical contributions: Robert L. Trimpi, ialrc, $3,000; Charles H.

Webb appeared on Voice of America, “Press Conference usa.” Speaking pf President Kennedy’s proposal for a joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. lunar program, Mr. Webb said: “. . . after the ratification of the test ban and one day after Mr. Gromyko proposed that we agree not to put into orbit multi-megaton weapons, the President followed with a suggestion that had five elements. Most people have centered on only one of them.” The five elements were (1) measures against war by accident or miscalculation; (2) measures against surprise attack; (3) measures to curb the nuclear arms race; (4) exchange of information and persons; (5) U.S. consent to Gromyko’s proposal to negotiate an agreement not to orbit large nuclear weapons. “And then he added as a sixth item, we should also explore, now mark you, he said explore, possibilities for cooperation in manned space flight and then set a clear indication that he was not thinking of a limited exploration, that rather he was thinking of a broad exploration . . ., that we could even go step by step to the planning of a joint expedition.” Speaking of the preparations for the President’s U.N. speech, Mr. Webb said: “. . . I myself personally attended a meeting in the White House called by Mr. Arthur Schlesinger, perhaps a month ago, to consider things that the President might want to discuss at the United Nations. And I did myself on the day before Mr. Gromyko’s speech have a long talk with the President, maybe 35 or 40 minutes, about the whole space program in which we discussed this. And I think I should say that he had his office phone me in St. Louis on Thursday afternoon after Mr. Gromyko made his speech to read me the language that he then decided he would use, because it seemed such a natural follow-on to Mr. Gromyko’s proposal.” (Text)

At the State Department luncheon honoring Astronaut Gordon Cooper, Vice President Johnson remarked: “In 1942, President Roosevelt called together our wartime leaders for the final decision on continuing or abandoning the Manhattan project which produced the atomic bomb. One of the most eminent leaders present heard presentation from all sides. Then, he solemnly gave President Roosevelt his verdict: ‘The bomb will never go off—I speak, of course, Mr. President, as an expert on explosives.’ “In that first, uncertain spring of the space age 5 years ago, some conscientious experts took the same attitude toward Project Mercury. History has proved them grossly wrong. . . . “Hitler once predicted the Nazis would wring England’s neck like a chicken. After the Battle of Britain, Winston Churchill said to Commons, ‘Some chicken. Some neck.’ We have heard some say recently that the civilian space program is only ‘leafraking.’ Considering Major Cooper—considering the vast technological cooperation which made his mission a success—I would say today, ‘Some leaf. Some rake.’” (Text, CR, 5/23/63, A3299)

Dr. Wemher von Braun, Director of nasa Marshall Space Flight Center testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight: “The F-l engine development program has an impressive list of accomplishments. A year after the contract was signed full-scale components were undergoing tests, and in 27 months complete engine systems testing had begun. Full thrust and full duration tests have become routine. The engine has been gimbaled during hot firing. We expect successful completion of the Preliminary Flight Rating Tests this year .... “When design of the F-l was begun in 1959, combustion instability was known to be a potential problem. Accordingly, early in the program tests of various injectors for the thrust chamber were conducted, and a design was selected which had not experienced unstable combustion. For about a year, from mid-1961 to mid-1962, engine tests were conducted without this phenomenon occurring. Then, on June 28 last year we were testing development engine #008 on the test stands in California. A test run which was scheduled for the full 2y2 minutes running time was interrupted after 106 seconds of satisfactory performance by a rupture of a valve casting. The rupture was traced to combustion instability. Since this occurrence, several cases of combustion instability have taken place. “This phenomenon is not unique to the F-l, but has occurred in the development of most liquid rocket engines .... “We are presently concentrating on combustion instability and are making progress. With the contractor at Rocketdyne, we have made an exhaustive survey of all test data having a bearing on the problem .... “To summarize, the F-l engine development over the last four years has made satisfactory progress . . . .” (Testimony) March 18: Frederick R.

At hearings on nasa proposed patent policy before Senate Subcommittee on Monopoly, Committee on Small Business, Senator Wayne Morse (D.-Ore.) charged nasa Administrator James E. Webb with tiying to give away “basic, substantive rights” of the public in Government financed research. Mr. Webb cited Section 305 of the Space Act of 1958 authorizing the nasa Administrator to waive Government patent rights, then outlined present nasa patent policy, and explained how proposed policy would extend patent waiver. “A careful comparison of the proposed revision with the terms of the present regulations . . . will show, I believe, that the public interest in inventions which come out of nasa’s research and development contracts is more clearly stated and would, in practice, be fully protected .... “It is evident from nasa’s present waiver regulations and the proposed revision that we are convinced that the public interest is often best served by permitting a contractor or subcontractor to retain commercial rights to inventions made in the course of doing research and development work funded by nasa—provided, of course? the Government acquires a royalty-free license for use of the invention for governmental purposes, and provided, also, that the invention is actually worked, nasa’s policy is intended to encourage use of inventions in two ways: first, by bringing the stimuli of the patent system into play and, second, by withholding the full benefits of waiver until public realization of the fruits of the invention have been achieved. Such a policy offers many advantages over a restrictive policy which would permit contractors to retain patent rights only in the exceptional case. The economy should not be deprived of the substantial benefits of the patent system. Incentives for contractors to conceal and protect new technological developments as trade secrets rather than to disclose them as patentable inventions are not desirable in government contracting for research and development. Historically, patent protection has been one of the rewards for full disclosure and publication . . . .” (Testimony; Wash. Post, 3/15/63)

These procedures will not make the spacecraft sterile but are expected to reduce the total population of viable organisms by orders of magnitude below otherwise expected quantities. As stated earlier, the natural environment of the Moon is believed suitably hostile to the propagation of Earth-like organisms to such an extent that any contamination will be contained in very local areas.” (Committee Hearings, NASA Authorization for Fiscal Year 1964—Part I, 598)
Vice President Lyndon B.

Certainly American leadership in space is not cheap. We are now spending 20 cents per week per capita on our national space program. “Other Americans ask if our space efforts are worthwhile. “I can answer in terms we can all understand. While the space age is not yet 5 years old, more than 5,000 companies and research organizations have been or are now involved in our space effort. We have produced more than 3,200 space-related products, many of which are already being put to use. “But, many prominent Republicans are questioning the value of the program. A former Republican President has referred to our moon project as a ‘stunt.’ “I can answer that simply: I do not believe that this generation of Americans is willing to resign itself to going to bed each night by the light of a Communist moon . . . .” (Text, CR, 5/23/63, A3243-44)

Under questioning by the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Independent Offices, nasa Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L. Dryden discussed the future space programs to follow the manned lunar landing program: “There are three principal candidates for what might be called the next program. These are the manned orbital laboratory; the further exploration of the moon; and finally, man’s interplanetary travel. “One difficulty is the definition, mercury is a one-man orbital laboratory; gemini is a two-man orbital laboratory; apollo is a three-man orbital laboratory; and all will stay up for the duration of the trip to the moon. “If you are going further, you come to a question, Do you want something for 3 men, 6 men, 12 men, or 20 men ? “One of our problems is to define the requirements and both the Department of Defense and ourselves are making studies. We have agreed there should be only one project for the time being because this will be a 2 or 3 billion project. We have agreed we will not proceed unilaterally. A decision, of course, has to be made as to what, if anything, in the 1965 budget will be in this field or another .... “As to the further exploration of the moon, the definition is a very variable one. You might leave an astronaut out and, figuratively speaking, take camping equipment along for a few days. Or you might convert a whole lunar bug to a freight carrier to extend the length of stay. You can go from that to a lunar base where you try to build a station, as m the Antarctic, that man can occupy for some time .... “All of these things run into the billions of dollars and certainly Congress will be involved in it. “There are people who favor one or another of these projects. I personally favor the manned orbital laboratory as being the next project. What we find on the Moon may change our minds on this, but from present knowledge I feel priority should go to a manned orbital laboratory. Some of this equipment has been in space for a period of a year or more. That is the length of a trip to Mars or Venus and back. “As you know, the matter of making major decisions of this kind in Government is a complicated one and I cannot say at this time when the hardware will be recommended by the administration. One reason for saying the manned orbital laboratory has priority is the possible military application.” (Hearings . . . Independent Offices Appropriations for FT 1964, Part 3,242-243)

Dr. Arthur R. Kantrowitz, Vice President of avco Corp., interviewed in U.S. News & World Report, said the moon was “set up as the priority target in our space program” because, at the time of the decision, “it was the most obvious goal .... But I think that, while it does provide us with a center for vigorous activity, it precluded other imaginative things that we might be doing, because it absorbs so much of our funds .... “I am one of those who favor, as our next objective, the permanent manned station in a low orbit around the earth .... It would give us a chance to learn to live and to work in space. It would give us a chance to achieve a larger vision of the potentialities of space .... A laboratory like this would enlarge man’s horizons in an important way. . . .” Dr. Kantrowitz said there was “certainly a possibility of going to the moon via a manned orbital station,” and that this might be the Soviet method. Asked if U.S. should be working on this approach in addition to lor, he said: “If we had two approaches, I would be willing to bet that it would accelerate our moon program, because there is a chance that either of these approaches will run into serious difficulties. Having two baskets for our eggs would seem to me to be a much more reasonable thing. Note that before the expensive later phases are reached by either approach a choice may be necessitated for economic reasons. “Furthermore, we might find after we’re deeper into the space program that there are more exciting things to be done than landing a man on the moon.” (U.S. News, 4/15/63,64-66)

Senator Clinton P. Anderson (D.-N.M.), Chairman, Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, speaking on the Senate floor stated: “The decision to try to land a man on the moon by 1970 does not constitute a crash program .... Failure to decide on a schedule for attempting to reach the moon is equivalent to setting no deadline at all. Work is done best—even by the technical community—which is not exempt from the laws of human nature—when a specific goal is set. An objective of landing on the moon in the 1960’s . . . permits us to work at a challenging pace; yet, does not absorb a greater percentage of the nation’s resources than our country can afford. This is only one percent of the gross national product at current rate .... “Project Apollo does not fit the description of a crash program.- The wartime Manhattan project was a crash program. We used all the resources we could to develop the atomic bomb in the shortest period of time, regardless of cost. We maintained duplicating operations over a 3-year period in the hope that one would work—and one did, in time to help win a war. Apollo is no such project. If it were, we would not have had the controversy over whether earth-orbiting rendezvous, lunar-orbiting rendezvous, or a direct landing was the best way to get a man to the moon. A crash project would have gone into operational stages of all three alternatives to a moon landing .... “The shortage of scientific manpower has not been aggravated in a measurable way by Apollo. Those critics who fear that it has, have not established their case. For example, in 1970, it is predicted that U.S. scientists and engineers will total 1,995,000, of which only 114,700 or less than 6 percent, will work for nasa and its contractors. It should be noted that a substantial portion of those are merely moving over from research and development work on aeronautics and missiles . . . nasa is enlarging its efforts to increase the national supply of scientific and engineering personnel. Last fiscal year, the agency provided graduate science and engineering fellowships to 100 students at 10 universities. In its budget proposal for fiscal 1964, nasa requests authorization for 1,250 fellowships covering 110 universities. “Additionally, the agency has provided funds for 150,000 square feet of research space at five universities; it is asking for funds to provide 400,000 square feet of laboratory space at 11 universi ties.” {OR, 5/23/63,8961-66)
President John F. Kennedy wrote a letter to Rep. Albert Thomas “I am very glad to respond to your letter of September 21 and to state my position on the relation between our great current space effort and my proposal at the United Nations for increased cooperation with the Russians in this field. In my view an energetic continuation of our strong space effort is essential, and the need for this effort is, if anything, increased by our intent to work for increasing cooperation if the Soviet Government proves willing. “As you know, the idea of cooperation in space is not new. My statement of our willingness to cooperate in a moon shot was an extension of a policy developed as long ago as 1958 on a bipartisan basis, with particular leadership from Vice President Johnson, who was then the Senate Majority Leader .... Our specific interest in cooperation with the Soviet Union, as the other nation with a major present capability in space, was indicated by me to Chairman Khrushchev in Vienna in the middle of 1961, and reaffirmed in my letter to him of March 7,1962 .... So my statement in the United Nations is a direct development of a policy long held by the United States Government. “Our repeated offers of cooperation with the Soviet Union have so far produced only limited responses and results .... But as I said in July of this year, there are a good many barriers of suspicion and fear to be broken down before we can have major progress in this field. Yet our intent remains: to do our part to bring those barriers down. “At the same time, as no one knows better than you, the United • States in the last five years has made a steadily growing national effort in space .... “This great national effort and this steadily stated readiness to cooperate with others are not in conflict. They are mutually supporting elements of a single policy. We do not make our space effort with the narrow purpose of national aggrandizement. We make it so that the United States may have a leading and honorable role in mankind’s peaceful conquest of space. It is this great effort which permits us now to offer increased cooperation with no suspicion anywhere that we speak from weakness. And in the same way, our readiness to cooperate with others enlarges the international meaning of our own peaceful American program in space. “In my judgment, therefore, our renewed and extended purpose of cooperation, so far from offering any excuse for slackening or weakness in our space effort, is one reason the more for moving ahead with the great program to which we have been committed as a country for more than two years. “So tne position of the United States is clear. If cooperation is possible, we mean to cooperate, and we shall do so from a position made strong and solid by our national effort in space. If cooperation is not possible—and as realists we must plan for this contingency too—then the same strong national effort will serve all free men’s interest in space, and protect us also against possible hazards to our national security. So let us press on . . . .” (Letter, 9/23/63) “The climate has changed. It is somewhat more favorable.” {M&R, 9/23/63, 14)
Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D.-N.M.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, told the Senate that it was unwarranted to assume from Premier Khrushchev’s Oct. 26 remarks that the Soviets had pulled out of the space race. “The competition in space between the United States and the Soviet Union is still intense. It would be foolish indeed if this country were to attempt to reorient its vast space program each time the Soviet Union made some pronouncement about its goals. We should take cognizance of Russian statements but we should not let ourselves be diverted from sound objectives on the ground that competition no longer exists.” {CR, 11/6/63, 20140)

Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator testifying on nasa’s international programs before House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said that the “first substantial fruits of these programs were realized in 1962 and further significant programs were laid down for future years. During 1962, “—the first two international satellites, Ariel and Alouette, were successfully placed in orbit, “—launchings of sounding rockets bearing scientific payloads were carried out in cooperation with eight countries, “—37 countries engaged in special projects in support of our weather and communications satellite programs, “—foreign participation continued to grow in the operation of our global tracking and data acquisition network overseas, “—and, a new nasa international fellowship program was successfully established in our own universities.” Discussing studies of follow-on projects to manned lunar landing, Dr. Dryden listed as “obvious candidates . . . establishment of a station on the moon permitting prolonged occupancy, a manned laboratory orbiting the earth as a satellite, and manned reconnaissance of the planets .... “It seems to us that an orbiting laboratory is a necessary preliminary to manned planetary expeditions .... “Obviously the capsules presently in the program do not have sufficient space available for experimentation and have only a limited lifetime in orbit. Something larger, of longer duration in orbit, and with resupply capability is required. Many exploratory design studies nave been made of the technological feasibility of assembling a large space laboratory in space from multiple launches with one or another of the available launch vehicles. We believe however that technical feasibility alone does not justify a project of this magnitude and cost. We are attempting to grasp the problem from the other end, that is to ask what one can and would do in a space laboratory in specific fields of science and technology with a view to establishing a realistic and useful concept. We hope that such studies will provide the information necessary to justify and support a decision to be made in time for the fiscal year 1965 budget. The program must be designed to fulfill national needs . . . .” (Testimony)	'
W. C. Mentzer, United Air Lines Vice President, told Wings Club in New York that projected British-French supersonic airliner was a challenge to U.S. If this country accepts challenge, it must be prepared to accept “two specific obligations . . . : First, to develop an intelligent long-term program of subsidy, and second, to encourage an economic environment in which the supersonic transport eventually may thrive.” (NYT, 5/14/63)
Interview by Howard Simons of Dr. Donald F. Hornig appeared in the Washington Post, Chairman of the Chemistry Dept, at Princeton Univ., Dr. Hornig was appointed Science Adviser to the President on November 7, accompanied President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson on a tour of military and space installations in November, and was recently reaffirmed as Science Adviser by President Johnson. Dr. Hornig has been one of the 18 members of the President’s Science Advisory Committee since 1960. Dr. Hornig was reported as saying that the place of basic research was distorted by the legacy of World War II when concentrated scientists were able to convert the most abstract scientific notions into impressive useful devices: “The days of pie-in-the-sky promises of basic research are over. The mood 20 years ago was one that suggested by turning loose great numbers of scientists miracles happened. Well they did happen, and I suppose it was logical that after the war the same notion would carry over. “Only it doesn’t work that way today. Miracles of the kind performed during the war are a little harder to find. Scientists are no longer concentrated nor are their efforts. They do come, of course, but over periods of years .... “The meaning of Sputnik,” Hornig said, “was that it demonstrated the Soviets were capable of big-time technology; capable, if you will, of playing in the big leagues.” He declined to label the American attempt to send men to the moon as a “race.” “The moon is, after all, the first important object beyond the earth. . . . There are valid scientific objectives to be pursued on the moon’s surface all linked to gaining new insights into cosmology and to providing clues to man’s destiny. That is, where we came from. ... (H. Simons, Wash. Post, 12/15/63, E3) December 15: dod decision to develop military communications satellite system, probably beginning operation in 1966, reported in New York Times. Funds were contained in proposed dod budget for FY 1965, recently presented to the White House. Plans called for 24—30 satellites in random polar orbits with altitudes ranging from 5,000-12,000 ini., linking military forces around the world. No contracts would be awarded, however, until discussions with ComSatCorp resolve question of whether dod should use commercial facilities for its military purposes. (Finney, NYT, 12/16/63,1)

Rep. Daniel J. Flood (D.-Penn.) recalled that this Subcommittee had been in the thick of the original Thor-Jupiter controversy, asked “what is the peculiar, special, and significant and distinct thing about the Thor missile which would argue that 15 at least be modified” while Jupiter missiles were being discarded as “garbage.” Gen. Gerrity replied that the reason was quantity rather than quality, that usaf had had more experience with Thor, and “We have launch facilities for the Thor but do not have launch facilities for the Jupiter.” Rep. Flood pressed Gen. Gerrity on “the marked physical distinction [between Thor and Jupiter] which would rush you into this conclusion?” The General did not recall a marked distinction. Rep. Flood asked “did nasa twist your arm and insist they get Thor instead of Jupiter ?” Gen. Gerrity said he knew “of no such circumstances.” (DOD Appro-riations Hearings, House, 88th Congress, 1st Session, Pt. 5, 973- •
nasa announced it would sponsor study to determine interest in system of “practical” satellites to collect data from remote areas of the earth. If warranted, study would be followed by a feasibility and design study. A possible use of data collection satellite was in oceanography, using instrumented floating buoys distributed over ocean surface to measure characteristics of the sea. Satellite would interrogate each buoy, store information, then transmit it upon command. Similar application was tracking of icebergs, using transponders planted on ice formations. Study would be under cognizance of nasa Future Applications Satellites unit, which was also investigating nonmilitary uses of navigational satellites, (nasa Release 63-55) • Senator Clifford P.

Dr. George L. Simpson, Jr., nasa Assistant Administrator for Technology Utilization and Policy Planning, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Applications and Tracking and Data Acquisition: “nasa is committed to a hard, driving effort to transfer the useful fruits of our research and development effort to the private sector of the economy in as quick and as useful a way as possible. “We are committed, first, because the Space Act requires it. nasa is directed to ‘Provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof.’ “We are also committed because we are mindful that a large part of the Nation’s r&d effort is occupied by the Federal agencies; and that it is essential that the maximum value be wrung out of this part of the total effort. “The requirements for space exploration begin in the field of anatomy and run through virtually the whole gamut of scientific and technological interest, through new power sources to zero gravity. Further, those things which are made for space travel receive no compromises from that harsh environment. Which is to say that a very large part of the total space work is at the very leading edge of the state-of-the-art; and that in another large part of the state-of-the-art must be extended. “It is reasonable to think that an effort of such size, range and sophistication, extending over a number of years, cannot fail to have major scientific and economic consequences: consequences that begin as scientific and technological advances and then are converted into new techniques of manufacture, new systems of organization, and new products and services. The space effort will be, we think, altogether comparable in its effect on the American economy to that of World War II. Our objective is to maximize, to facilitate, to speed up this effect. . . . “We are aware that past experience indicates severe problems in the transfer of government research and development efforts to private use. However, we feel that the Nation’s well being requires a major effect to determine whether these problems can be solved.” (Testimony)
Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, in Associated Press interview, was asked: “Mr. Vice President, as chairman of the Space Advisory Council [i.e., National Aeronautics and Space Council], you were intimately concerned in drafting the 5.7-billion-dollar space budget. Former President Eisenhower says the budget is spongy, and there is no hurry about getting to the moon. In view of this recent Russian shot [lunik iv], what is your reaction?” The Vice President replied: “The Administration has submitted to the Congress what we believe is a sane and responsible proposal to insure the maximum efficiency and effectiveness of our space program. I know of no reckless desire in any responsible quarter to get to the moon at all costs and without regard to the consequences to other vital aspects of our national policy. “The objective of reaching the moon is one aspect or our national space program which will be of great benefit to our country, and I think to all mankind. It may be possible by appropriating more money to speed up slightly the attainment of that goal and, of course, we all know it would be mighty easy to slow that goal down. But I don’t think that either alternative would be helping our country. Gaining a short period of time would almost certainly be at the expense of other crucial programs. Slowing down might bring us some one of these days face to face with the shocking knowledge that we had permanently assigned ourselves to second place. “So, all in all, I think the Administration has submitted a program which we can all embrace and both parties can fully support.” (AP, Wash. Post, 4/8/63)	’
Dr. Frederick Seitz, President of the National Academy of Sciences, testified at the initial hearing held by the House Select Committee on Government Research. Dr. Seitz warned Congress against starving basic research and individual or small-team research “in order to divert funds for research which appears to be more spectacular from a popular standpoint .... There appear to be signs of such diversion in the present session of the Congress.” As evidence of this trend, Dr. seitz pointed out the relative size of the cuts in the nasa budget compared with the cuts of the National Science Foundation. Also, he pointed out, even the nasa cuts were heavier in space sciences than in manned space flight or applications, nasa, he thought, should play a role like that of the Office of Naval Research ten years ago, offering broad support to basic research in chemistry, physics, astronomy, and other sciences.

Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, addressing Governors’ Conference at Miami Beach, said: “In the world of today, we must recognize that the winds and the waves are with us. This is the time for us to steer straight and true toward the horizons we have for so long hoped to reach. “But we should also recognize that favoring winds are rising at home. Our record in space is a prime example. We started late. We moved too slowly at first. “But the record shows now that where the Soviet Union has successfully launched 43 payloads into orbit, the United States has launched 144. “Our ratio of sucesses to failures in launchings prior to 1961 was only 1 to 1—but it has now reached the ratio of 5 to 1. “The Soviet continues its lead in the ability to launch heavier weight into space. But we are pulling far ahead in developing practical uses of space with weather, communication, and navigation satellites. “We are not racing for prestige in space. We are engaged in a deadly serious race for peace—and for control of our own destiny. This is a race free men must win . . . .” (Text, CR, A4759-60)

Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D.-N.M.), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, spoke to the 1963 Annual Conference of the Atomic Industrial Forum in New York on the relationship between Congress and science. Sen. Anderson offered four main reasons for the new level of Congressional concern over the Federal investment in science and technology: (1) cost consciousness; (2) “the belief among some Members that Congress has lost the ability to oversee effectively the vast diffusion of r&d activities for which it appropriates funds”; (3) “concern that the procedures of Congress, in some respects, may not measure up to the demands of ‘big science’ ”; and (4) “criticism of the space program as ‘moon madness’ and ‘lunacy’ gets lumped in with the criticism of heavy spending for research and development.” Sen. Anderson agreed with the aims of those who were cost conscious, although he noted that many r&d programs that had been canceled as “failures” had in fact left a valuable technological legacy to subsequent programs. He agreed that Congress needed more advice on technical matters, but doubted that the need would be solved by Congress hiring its own technical staff; rather it needed more help from specially convened panels; more engineering advice—since the bulk of the Nation’s $15 billion annual investment in science and technology is in the engineering of hardware rather than in science; improved presentations by the Executive Department, including more briefing by the Office of Science and Technology; expansion of channels of information such as Library of Congress, nas, nsf; reports by the scientific and engineering communities to Congress on the state of science and of engineering; and more long-term planning, (iOR, 12/3/63, 21997-22000)	_

Surveyor will demonstrate soft landing technology, will survey various landing areas on the lunar surface, and wifi measure physical-chemical properties of the lunar surface in the immediate vicinity of the spacecraft .... “Developments of the Surveyor orbiter were restricted during FY 1963 to permit reprogramming of funds into more critical areas in the Ranger and Surveyor landing programs. Design work has proceeded, however, and has resulted in ... [a system making] extensive use of Surveyor lander components. In FY 1964 we will begin work on the flight hardware. The lunar orbiter will provide complete photo-reconnaissance coverage which will permit us to extrapolate to other areas our knowledge about local spots in which we have landed with Ranger and Surveyor. We will then be able to make selections of potential manned lunar landing sates. In addition, the orbiter will enable use to determine the gravity field of the moon which will affect the Apollo orbits . . . .” (Testimony)
