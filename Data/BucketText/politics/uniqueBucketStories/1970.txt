Boeing Co. would lay off some 18 000 persons in Puget Sound area during 1970, company Vice President Lowell P. Michelwait said in Seattle. Company employed 101 500 in peak year 1968. Nationwide force declined by 25 500 during 1969. Boeing employment in Seattle area was 80 000 and would drop to 62 000. Figures indicated 40% drop in work force in 2 1/2 yrs. Decline was attributed to slower commercial aircraft sales, failure to win new Government contracts, reduced Government spending, completion of current Government contracts, and increased productivity in 747 jet airliner assembly lines.

L/G Leslie R. Groves (USA, Ret.), former member of Army Corps of Engineers and head of Manhattan Project that developed atomic bomb, died of heart attack at age 73. Gen. Groves, who had described first atomic test in his 1962 book Now It Can Be Told, had been awarded USA’s Distinguished Service medal for his contributions to the project and to shortening World War II. He had also supervised construction of numerous dod facilities—including Pentagon and laboratories at Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Hanford, Wash.; and Los Alamos, N. Mex.—before his retirement from USA in 1948.

Charles W. Harper, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology (Aeronautics), discussed NASA’s role in development of anticollision systems for aircraft before House Committee on Government Operations’ Subcommittee on Government Activities. It appeared “impractical” to force small general-aviation aircraft “to avoid controlled airspace or to carry the expensive equipment and undergo the intensive training necessary to place them under positive control of the atc [air traffic control] system. For these reasons, faa has asked NASA to investigate the possibility of developing inexpensive, lightweight equipment for small aircraft which would augment significantly the collision avoidance probability when the pilot is flying on the see-and-be-seen principle. .. NASA program was guided by FAA’s Collision Prevention Advisory Group, of which NASA was member, and by NASA Research and Technology Advisory Committee’s Subcommittee on Aircraft Operating Problems, of which faa was member. Both groups included representatives of industry and other Government agencies. (Testimony)

Examination of Federal science policy was essential, Dr. Philip Handler, nas President, said in testimony before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development. “Substantial changes are being made in the organization of some arms of the executive branch of government that deal with science; the Mansfield Amendment which limits the manner in which research-supporting funds may be utilized by the Department of Defense has begun to influence. , .behavior of other agencies of the government as well; federal funding for fundamental studies has remained essentially plateaued in absolute dollars for four consecutive fiscal years while, in constant dollars, such funding has declined by perhaps 25%.”. NASA appropriation “has been reduced significantly and one frequently hears that federal military and space expenditures for R&D are to be reduced for some years to come; the nation seems determined to mitigate the damage which has been done to our natural environment, but flounders in the attempt; our nation is engaged in the painful exercise of assessing and reassembling our priorities; and our country now seems uncertain in what light, and with what resolution, it should view the pace of future scientific progress. Our national apparatus for the conduct of research and scholarship is not yet dismantled, but it is falling into shambles. Morale of the scientific community is lower than at any time since World War II. Yet, new fields of scientific exploration and application clamor for attention and funding.” U.S. lead in science ‘‘is in jeopardy.” Loss of lead “bodes ill for our future national security and for the vigor of our economy.” (Testimony)
