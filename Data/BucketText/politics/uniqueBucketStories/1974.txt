Aircraft designer Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson announced his retirement as Senior Vice President of Lockheed Aircraft Corp., effective in mid-January 1975. During his 43 yrs with Lockheed, Johnson had contributed to the design of some 40 aircraft—about half of them his original designs—including the P-38 “Lightning” fighter of World War II, the P-80 jet fighter, the Constellation series of airliners, the F-104 mach 2 fighter, the U—2 reconnaissance plane and its successor SR—71, and the C-130 transport. In 1964 President Johnson awarded Johnson the National Medal of Science, citing his achievements and products “as both incomparable and virtually incredible.” (Getler, W Post, 8 Nov 74, A12)
The House passed the NASA authorization bill, H.R. 13998, by a vote of 341 to 37. The total authorization was $3,259 billion, $6 million over the $3,253 billion suggested by the House Committee on Science and Astronautics 10 April and $12 million above the Administration request of $3,247 billion. On the floor, the House had approved an additional $3.9 million for research in coal extraction, coal energy conversion, and mine safety. An additional $2 million was authorized for research in hydrogen production and use. (CR, 25 April 74, H3201-31)
The House of Representatives by a 253-to-2 vote passed H.R. 11864, the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974. The bill would authorize $50 million over five years for the early commercial demonstration of solar heating technology by NASA and the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development, in cooperation with the National Bureau of Standards, the National Science Foundation, the General Services Administration, and other Federal agencies, and early development and commercial demonstration of technology for combined solar heating and cooling. H.R. 11864 was the clean bill that resulted from the 19 Dec. 1973 recommendation -of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Energy to revise, amend, and combine H.R. 10952, introduced 16 Oct. 1973, and 18 similar bills. The bill was sent to the Senate. (CR, 13 Feb 74, H774; Background <& Legis Hist, Com Print, Feb 74)
General Aviation Programs, forwarded to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics by the Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology, reported on an oversight review based on hearings 14 and 15 May and a visit to general-aviation manufacturers in Kansas 31 May and 1 June. Noting that general aviation made up about 97% of the civil aircraft fleet, flew 79% of the hours and 71% of the miles, and carried up to one third of all intercity passengers—the Subcommittee recommended: continued close NASA-industry cooperation, NASA assistance to Federal agencies to ensure realistic regulations, individual attention to special general-aviation needs, NASA noise and emission research, concerted industry effort to use new technology, NASA effort to increase public visibility of its program, NASA-industry measures toward better understanding of respective roles in research and development, and an annual General Aviation Manufacturers Assn, evaluation of the NASA program.

Elmer S. “Todd” Groo had been appointed Associate Administrator for Center Operations at nasa Hq., effective 4 Sept., NASA announced. Groo, the first to hold the position created in the reorganization announced 5 March, would be responsible for agency-wide planning and direction of institutional resources and operational activities at NASA field installations. Groo had retired in 1973 from ibm World Trade Corp., where he had served as vice president since 1959. (nasa Release 72—221; msfc Release 74-146)
nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs George W. Cherry testified in hearings on technology for subsonic aircraft before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology. NASA aeronautical programs were structured to provide the airframe industry and its airline customers an efficient and environmentally benign technology base for a new-generation subsonic aircraft. The supercritical aerodynamics program included studies to improve structural efficiency without increasing drag, thrust, or fuel consumption. F-8 and F-lll aircraft flight tests with the supercritical wing had shown that using supercritical aerodynamics on passenger transports would increase profits 2.5% over those of conventional aircraft, or $78 million a year, on a fleet of 280 two-hundred-passenger aircraft. Advanced transport technology studies showed that aircraft extensively employing composite materials would show a yearly profit of 2.7%, or $100 million, on a fleet of 280 two-hundred-passenger aircraft. NASA propulsion technology had initiated an advanced multistage axial-flow experimental compressor weighing 60% less than conventional compressors. This, with technology advances in other components, could reduce gross aircraft weights and fuel consumption 10%. (Transcript) ■
Nelson A. Rockefeller was sworn in as Vice President of the United States after the House confirmed his nomination. The Senate had confirmed the nomination 10 Dec. (CR, 10 Dec 74, D1343; 19 Dec 74, D1413, D1416)
