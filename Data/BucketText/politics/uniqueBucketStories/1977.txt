Global communications systems used by the Dept, of Defense were inadequate, inefficient, and incapable of surviving nuclear attack, according to the investigation subcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services. A United Press report carried in the W Star quoted subcommittee criticism of the Pentagon’s top-secret command post which, “while located in the basement of the Pentagon, [showed] little possibility that the National Military Command Center would survive a nuclear attack directed against it.” The report cited “dismay over the department’s inability to deploy a satellite communications system after 16 years of effort,” “security deficiencies” in the computer software of the worldwide Military Command and Control System, weaknesses in the Tri-Service Tactical Communications program, and “urgent need for early deployment of improved voice security equipment throughout the military services.” The report commended the use of airborne command posts such as the converted Boeing 747 “doomsday plane” that had taken President Carter to Georgia the previous wk.
