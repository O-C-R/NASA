Role of ekc in electronics-related aeronautical R&D was described by ERC Director James C. Elms in testimony before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology. Center had continued research on electronic components and devices, especially application of microelectronics and large-scale integrated circuits to advanced avionics systems; on application of advanced technology to instrumentation for sensing and controlling aircraft motion and attitude; on optics and microwaves; on psychological instrumentations; on data processing; and on electrical power systems. erc had 14 programs in aeronautical R&D, including air traffic control, v/stol guidance, navigation and flight control, collision avoidance, use of navigational and communications satellites in aviation, support technology, remote detection of clear air turbulence, physiological monitoring, and NASA intercenter research in high-speed flight using YF—12 aircraft.

U.K.’s Institute for Strategic Studies predicted U.S.S.R. would overtake U.S. in ICBM production by mid-1969 but U.S. would retain overall lead in nuclear weapons because of greater submarine and air forces. U.S. international role in 1970s could become smallest since pre-World War II. (upi, W Star, 4/11/69, A12)

Pentagon sources estimated U.S.S.R. was spending equivalent of $60 billion in 1969 on national defense and space efforts, while U.S. was spending $85.2 billion, of which $29 billion was for Vietnam war. Figures left U.S.S.R. $4 billion ahead of U.S. in spending on weapon and space technology. Between 1965 and 1969, Soviet spending on offensive and defensive strategic forces increased by 40% but amount spent on intercontinental missiles and surface-to-air missile defense systems rose by 75%.

NAS report to Congress, Technology: Processes of Assessment and Choice, was published by House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Panel headed by Harvey Brooks of Harvard Univ. strongly urged creation of “constellation of organizations, with components located strategically within both political branches, that can create a focus and a forum for responsible technology-assessment activities throughout government and the private sector.” Such organizations “must be separated scrupulously from any responsibility for promoting or regulating technological applications.” (Text)

In interview published by New York Times, Boeing Co. Vice President H. W. Withington said sst cost, quoted at $40 million, would climb to $50 million or $60 million if inflation continued at current rate. He did not expect increase to cut heavily into sales. Under current forecast, Boeing would have to raise “about $2-billion to go into production, and that’s assuming we get 50 per cent progress payments [half of the purchase price] in the 1973—74 period. I’m not so sure we’ll be able to do this.” (Lindsey, NYT, 10/17/69)

Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, Dean of MIT School of Engineering and former NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, was among persons inside mit Instrumentation Laboratory when students from mit and other Boston, Mass., campuses demonstrated against laboratory’s defense work and were confronted by police. Later Dr. Bisplinghoff said: “The university has set as policy a deliberate movement from Department of Defense and space research to a different mix: more and more research relevant to societal problems. It’s going to take a considerable time to make the transition, however, and if we are going to continue on the same scale of operations . . . we’re going to need lots of time and new money.” It would be up to Congress to change emphasis, not mit. Instrumentation Laboratory, meanwhile, would honor commitments to dod, including work on Poseidon missile. (Nordheimer, NYT, 11/9/69, 61)
