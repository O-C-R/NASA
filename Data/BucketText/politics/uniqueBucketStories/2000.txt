President William J. Clinton signed into law H. R. 1654, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2000, authorizing funding for “a robust space and aeronautics program for the Nation.” Clinton commended bipartisan efforts to pass an authorization bill funding NASA’s priorities, such as building the ISS, improving Space Shuttle safety, and using the Space Launch Initiative to reduce the cost of access to space. However, Clinton criticized the bill for limiting “NASA’s flexibility to pursue a promising commercial habitation module” for the ISS, saying that the bill included several “objectionable provisions” and only one of the 14 legislative provisions that his administration had proposed.(U.S. Newswire, “Clinton Statement on Signing of the ‘National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2000’,” 30 October 2000.)
