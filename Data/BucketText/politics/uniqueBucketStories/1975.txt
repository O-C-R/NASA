NASA marked the 60th anniversary of the first meeting of NASA’s predecessor institution, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Established by a law signed by President Woodrow Wilson 3 March 1915, NACA had 12 presidentially appointed members from the military and scientific communities “to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight, with a view to their practical solution” and “to direct and conduct research and experiments in aeronautics.” During its nearly half-century of operation, NACA was responsible for the technical proficiency of U.S. aviation. Early NACA wind-tunnel research yielded the unique NACA cowling and wing shapes that would dominate aeronautics into the 1940s. NACA’s fundamental research and its direct application to industrial, military, and civil aviation helped create the world’s greatest commercial air transportation network before World War II and the world’s strongest air forces during that conflict. In 1947, it was the NACA-Air Force X—1 aircraft that broke the sound barrier. The agency had remained small in size and budget through 1939 when 523 persons worked with $4.5 million in funds. By the mid-1940s the staff had grown to 6800 and its budget to an annual $40 million. In 1958 the National Space Act dissolved NACA, transferring its 8000 workers and “all functions, powers, duties and obligations” to the new National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The; House of Representatives, by a vote of 318 to 72, passed H.R. 4700, the bill authorizing NASA $3 585 873 000 in funds for FY1976 and $922 450 000 for the transition period 1 July through 30 Sept. 1976. The bill was passed as reported out of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics 14 March, (CR, 9 April 75, H2549—75)
Alexander P. Vinogradov, leading geochemist of the U.S.S.R. and vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, had died at Moscow at the age of 80, according to Tass, the Soviet news agency. Vinogradov had identified 40 chemical elements in earth’s soil zones and had developed a new field of investigation called cosmochemistry—the chemical analysis of lunar and Venus composition. He had remained active as the head of Moscow’s Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry. (Tass, in FBIS, 17 Nov 75; NYT, 19 Nov 75, 38; Aero Daily, 20 Nov 75, 112)
