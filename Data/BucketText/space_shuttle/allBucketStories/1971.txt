Status of space shuttle technology was described by MSFC propulsion engineer Gerald M. Thompson during aiaa/sae Seventh Propulsion Joint Specialist Conference at Salt Lake City, Utah. Because “shuttle propulsion technology has been vigorously pursued in a totally organized approach for several years,” no major technology work remained to be done before shuttle main engine development phase began. Designs with strong technical bases were ready to proceed. However, if hydrogen propulsion was selected for air-breathing engines that would return shuttle stages to landing fields on mission completion, additional technology development would add about one year to schedule. Main engine development was to begin in 1971, with flight certification targeted for March 1978. (msfc Release 71-103)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said strong technology base was “absolutely vital” to U.S., in speech before 14th Annual Aerospace Luncheon of Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. Indications from critics of lack of confidence in advancement of “greatest technological evolution in the history of mankind” was reminder that “we must do a better job of convincing the man-on-the-street of the [space] program’s merits.” Public needed information “to put its priorities in proper perspective.” There was “something seriously wrong” when “as a nation we pay people more not to work and more in farm subsidies than we do on space research, a program which impacts our national economy and vitally affects our national security. ... I am convinced that further erosion of our technological leadership will start us on a downhill course from which it will be difficult to recover.” But, “in our zeal to forge ahead in technical and scientific fields, it is possible to lose sight of the debt we owe to the great American public that so steadfastly sustained us during the early years.” Average American had his priorities. “But he needs to be informed if he is to arrive at an intelligent decision about how to rank his priorities.” Burden of convincing public of necessity for “continuing well-balanced space program for the 1970’s and beyond” lay with those in program. Dr. Fletcher also said: “We want cooperation with the Soviets as well as with other nations throughout the world. We are ready to do our part to get it, but if we have learned the lessons of history, we should know that the Soviets will not be eager to cooperate with a second-rate power. . . . And that is what we will become if we do not proceed with the space shuttle in this decade. We cannot create the environment needed for space cooperation, or an era of enduring peace, by handing over a monopoly in the realm of orbital flight to the Soviet Union or anyone else.” (Text)

Senate Committee on Appropriations favorably reported H.R. 9382, FY 1972 HUD-space-science appropriations bill that contained $3,325-billion NASA appropriation. Committee added $24 million for NERVA to nasa request of $2,518 billion for r&d, making total of $2,542 billion, and rejected House recommendations for cuts in construction of facilities appropriation, including $20 million for space shuttle funding. (CR, 7/15/71, D703; SBD, 7/16/71, 70)
Management plans for omsf space shuttle program were announced by NASA: OMSF Hq. in Washington, D.C., would be responsible for overall management, including assignment of responsibilities, basic performance requirements, control of major milestones, and funding allocations to nasa centers. Dale D. Myers, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, had assigned responsibility for program control, overall systems engineering and systems integration, and overall responsibility for definition of elements of total system that interacted with other elements to MSC, which also would be responsible for shuttle’s orbiter stage. MSFC would be responsible for booster stage and shuttle’s main engines. ICSC would be responsible for design of launch and recovery facilities. All three centers would station personnel at MSC for systems engineering and integration activity, (nasa Release 71—104)
Immediate report from nasa on role of Dale D. Myers, Deputy Administrator for Manned Space Flight, in award of $500-million space shuttle engine contract to NR Rocketdyne Div. was requested by Rep. William R. Cotter (D-Conn.). In statement to press, Rep. Cotter said Myers “as co-chairman of the joint NASA-Pentagon space transportation system committee, may have been instrumental in cutting off Air Force funding of Pratt & Whitney’s space shuttle research under the XLR—129 program.” Cotter said Pratt & Whitney Div. of United Aircraft Corp. had based its contention of superior “technical knowhow” on shuttle engine development [see Aug. 3] on its 10-yr XLR-129 research. Myers had been a Rocketdyne Vice President before coming to nasa in 1970. (Text; Warden, C Trib, 8/27/71,22)
NASA announced it had authorized MSFC to extend for one month the level-of-effort contract with NR Rocketdyne Div. for design of Space Shuttle main engine. Action had been taken pending completion of gao review of United Aircraft Corp. Pratt & Whitney Div.’s protest of contract award to Rocketdyne [see Aug. 3]. (nasa Release 71—249)
Oklahoma Governor Dewey H. Bartlett told state legislature in Oklahoma City there was good possibility that Oklahoma could become launch site for NASA space shuttle. “Based on the launch azimuth and the orbital inclinations . . . Oklahoma provides both a desirable launch and recovery location.” (Daily Oklahoman, 1/6/71, 1)
Calibration had been completed at msfc on new tube wind tunnel capable of test speeds up to twice speed of sound, Marshall Star reported. Tube was 130 cm (52 in) in diameter and was 119 m (390 ft) long. It would be used in wind-tunnel test program for space shuttle. (Marshall Star, 1/13/71,1)
NASA launched two Nike-Apache sounding rockets from esrange, Kiruna, Sweden, to sample noctilucent clouds and particulate matter in upper atmosphere. First payload was launched to altitude of 114 km (70.8 mi) and recovered within 2 hrs 15 min after launch in good condition. Mission was considered 100% successful. Second payload attained 106 km (65.9 mi) and was recovered within 2 hrs of launch. Two of eight collector doors opened prematurely and caused slightly reduced apogee, but experiment results were not affected and mission was judged 100% successful. (NASA Rpts srl) During July: Sen. Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) praised U.S. space shuttle program in Aerospace article: “Logic dictates that we should move ahead with the shuttle program. Experience tells us that the aerospace industry can respond to even seemingly impossible challenges— and that nations that reject the major challenges of their times do not remain major powers. And a hard fact of international economics is that the United States can remain prosperous in this world only by maintaining and utilizing its advanced technology.” (Aerospace, 7/71, 3-7)
nasa published Mariner-Venus 1967, Final Project Report (nasa SP—190). In foreword, Project Manager Glenn A. Reiff said Mariner 5 (launched June 14, 1967, toward Oct. 19, 1967, flyby of planet Venus), apart from significant contributions to knowledge of deep space, had achieved secondary objective, “to gain engineering experience by converting a spare Mariner-Mars 1964 spacecraft into one that could be flown to Venus,” with substantial savings. Cost of mission had been 10% less than anticipated. (Text) During 1971: U.S. orbited 51 spacecraft in 29 launches—including Apollo 14 and 15 csms Kitty Hawk and Endeavor with lms Antares and Falcon and their S—IVB stages intentionally crashed onto moon. U.S.S.R. orbited 97 payloads in 83 launches; Japan, 2; U.K., 1; France, 1; Italy, 2 (1 for U.S. on U.S. booster); and Communist China, 1. U.S. total included 33 orbited by DOD in 17 launches and 19 by NASA in 13 launches. NASA’s total included 1 launched for USAF on behalf of NATO, 1 for France, and 1 for U.K. NASA’s manned space flight program continued with launches of Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 manned lunar landing missions. Mobile equipment transporter, used for first time on Apollo 14 to carry equipment and samples, allowed astronauts to explore 3.5 km (2.2 mi) of lunar surface and collect 43 kg (94.8 lbs) of samples. On Apollo 15, astronauts traveled 28 km (17.4 mi) over lunar surface on four-wheeled, battery-powered lunar roving vehicle (lrv) Rover and collected 77 kg (170 lbs) of lunar samples, including one white anorthosite rock about 4 billion yrs old. Unmanned program was highlighted by Mariner 9 Mars probe, which traveled 400 million km (248 million mi) to Mars and began transmitting photos of major Mars dust storm and, later, of details of Martian surface and moons Deimos and Phobos. Mariner 8 launch vehicle malfunctioned at launch. Oso 7 Orbiting Solar Observatory—rescued from initially incorrect orbit by ground command—made first x-ray observations of beginning solar flare and revealed that sun had “polar caps.” Other unmanned missions included lntelsat-IV F-2 and Intelsat-IV F—3 for ComSatCorp and Explorer 43, Explorer 44, and Explorer 45 (the last launched for NASA by Italy). Launched as secondary payloads were Subsatellite on Apollo 15 and Tetr 3 on Oso 7. All elements of Skylab flight system reached final manufacturing and checkout in preparation for 1973 launch and intensive engineering studies on Space Shuttle were conducted throughout year. In joint NASA—usaf lifting-body program, M2—F3 and X—24A lifting bodies made 17 flights, including first supersonic flight by M2-F3. X-24A reached 1687 km per hr (1048 mph) before completing program and beginning modification for new flight program as X—24B. In aeronautics NASA TF-8A jet aircraft with supercritical wing - made 27 successful flights. USN F-14 fighter aircraft successfully demonstrated first automatically programmable variable sweep wing. USA CH—54B helicopter set new world altitude record of 5120 m (16 798 ft) while carrying 10 000-kg (22 000-lb) payload. New v/stol Wind Tunnel at LaRC became operational, providing greatly improved testing capability for scaled models. GE quiet experimental engine successfully completed initial tests in NASA program to reduce jet engine noise, and NASA let competitive design contracts for development of quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (questol) transport U.S.-U.S.S.R. Space Activity, 1957-1971 Successful Launches to Earth Orbit or Beyond aircraft, sst program ended, with Congress voting to terminate program. In sounding rocket program, 126 successful flights were made to study atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomagnetic storms, meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations and to make astronomical observations in x-ray, uv, and radio regions of electromagnetic spectrum. DOD’s 33 payloads included orbiting of 2 Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs-2) military comsats, 2 ov—i scientific satellites, and Cannonball 2 and Mmketball. U.S.S.R.’s 83 launches set an all-time record in number of flights. The 97 payloads included 81 Cosmos satellites, 2 Luna, 2 Soyuz, 1 Salyut, 2 Mars, 1 Intercosmos, 4 Meteor, 2 Molniya I, 1 Molniya II, and Oreol (launched for France).

(nasa Release 71—245; NASA Lifting Body Off; GSFC Sounding Rocket Br; NASA Exec Secretariat; Sheldon, United States and Soviet Progress in Space, Library of Cong, 1/22/72) • NASA’s scientific and societal achievements advanced national goal of alleviating environmental problems and expanding basic research on behalf of humanity, as public pressed for immediate, usable returns from research in all fields. Apollo manned missions swelled storehouse of lunar information. Unmanned astronomical missions gathered unique data, including new clues to Martian atmosphere. NASA-developed inventions saw increased use beyond space exploration—in environmental sciences, communications, medicine, industry, and agriculture. U.S.—U.S.S.R. space meetings set stage for future joint space missions. And balanced program of space and ^aeronautics, despite low funding level, continued to raise U.S. prestige as aerospace pioneer while it worked to improve man’s future. Some observers, however, warned of higher rate of technological advances abroad than in U.S. and of ever-growing U.S.S.R. space program and technological capability. Soviet expenditures on space were estimated at level about double U.S. peak expenditure of l°/o of GNP when combined nasa-dod space program was at highest level and four times present level. Dr. James C. Fletcher was nominated new nasa Administrator by President Nixon. President of Univ. of Utah and former aerospace executive, Dr. Fletcher took office April 27. He succeeded NASA’s third Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, who had resigned Sept. 15, 1970, to return to industry. Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, had served as Acting NASA Administrator in the interim. Operating at lowest budget level since 1962, nasa in 1971 continued phase-out of Apollo program with successful completion of Apollo 14 and 15. Man’s fourth landing on moon, in Apollo 15 mission, proved to many that man had an effective scientific role in space. At year’s end, Apollo 16 had been scheduled for March 1972, with Apollo 17 to complete program later in year. Reduced funding forced additional reduction of personnel as well as program cutbacks, stretching out remaining Apollo missions, delaying first Skylab flight, and slowing studies of space shuttle, nerva nuclear rocket engine program was reduced to holding action. Bioscience funding was eliminated. Aerospace employment in industry throughout nation also fell, reflecting cuts in DOD spending as well as in NASA’s. During year, however, Skylab hardware manufacture neared completion and space shuttle work continued. Shuttle preliminary design contracts were extended so that nasa could examine alternative configurations, contingent on Administration approval of shuttle development. In erts program, aircraft tested remote sensing devices for gathering earth resources data and first satellite for global monitoring of resources was scheduled for 1972. During 1971, instrumented aircraft measured air pollution, investigated corn blight infestation, and sought hidden natural resources. Pioneer-F spacecraft for planned 1972 launch and December 1973 Jupiter flyby went into final manufacturer’s tests. Increased emphasis on aeronautics included research into aircraft noise reduction, increased air transport efficiency with use of supercritical wing, and STOL aircraft for transportation. To emphasize practical goals of space science, NASA established new Office of Applications, increased technology utilization budget from $1 million to $5 million, and issued request for proposals for additional uses of space-developed technology to solve problems of society. Among NASA projects were nsf contract to investigate use of solar cells to electrify homes and buildings and hud contract to study application of space technology to sewage recycling. Joint nasa-dot study resulted in recommendations for civil aviation R&d policy (card). Research achievements at NASA centers included ARC discovery of amino acids—building blocks of life—in second meteorite. Discovery strengthened case for chemical evolution of life elsewhere in universe. NASA FY 1972 appropriation of $3,298 billion was $27 million more than requested $3,271 billion and $29 million above FY 1971 appropriation of $3,269 billion—halting downward trend but far below 1965 peak of $5,250 billion.

Dr. Vasily V. Parin—Soviet physiologist, former President of Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, and member of Soviet Academy of Sciences—died at age 68 of liver ailment. Dr. Parin had been known primarily for his work during 1960s on human physiological problems during space flight and had authored studies on effect of weightlessness on functioning of heart and circulatory system. He had received Order of Lenin, U.S.S.R’s highest award, in 1963 for his work in developing Soviet medical science. (AP, NYT, 5/Yl/ll, 42) Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, testified June 15 on nasa policy on backup spacecraft and Centaur reliability: “In the manned program, all possible steps are taken to assure the safety of the astronauts. Single point failures are reduced to an absolute minimum. Missions are planned to build upon the previous missions so as to reduce the number of unknowns.” Within missions, “plateaus are established so that all systems can be checked out in real time prior to committing to the next plateau. Vigorous testing procedures coupled with redundancy and in many cases dual redundancy are adopted before a system is ‘man-rated.’ ” In Skylab “we are building a back-up workshop which will be brought right up to the point of actual checkout. This will permit us to proceed with the program even in the event that the first workshop would not be successfully launched. Similarly, we will have a single back-up Command and Service Module-Saturn IB capability for the three manned visits to the workshop.” Capability was built into program and was “key to the plan for a rescue capability in Skylab which we recently adopted.” In earth-orbital automated programs “we generally plan a series of related missions, using identical or similar hardware. If we have a mission failure, decisions will then be made, based on all available factors, whether we will (1) prepare and fly a specific back-up to the mission which failed, (2) modify succeeding flights ... to achieve the objectives, or (3) defer achieving the mission objectives to future years.” In planetary programs, with launch opportunities at only discrete intervals, NASA usually had provided for two identical launches. Each launch in dual mission was planned to complement its twin, while at same time serving as backup if twin were lost. This year Manner 9 was backup, flying hybrid mission. Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle had history of 3 failures out of 16 operational vehicles, without apparent relationship between failures, giving probability of success of 80% if based solely on past experience. Launch vehicles for automated missions—such as Scout, Delta, and Atlas-Centaur—were “complex systems without much redundancy, and cannot be expected to achieve reliabilities much greater than about 90% without very major and costly changes. They certainly cannot be considered ‘man-rated’ vehicles.” Addition of redundant systems would be investigated again but was not complete solution. Redundancy added weight, reduced payload capability, and was expensive. For launch vehicles of size of Titan-Centaur, which would carry Viking and Grand Tour payloads, additional redundancy might be practicable and desirable and would be actively studied. Major increase in reliability of achieving orbit would be one of important attributes of space shuttle. Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, on June 16 continued testimony on backup philosophy, expanding on application in ossa: “We do not schedule backup missions for observatory spacecraft. We always buy, and intend to fly, at least two flight units of a new series of observatory-class spacecraft. When we have a failure or a malfunction in a spacecraft or a launch vehicle we will always do everything possible to thoroughly understand and correct all other future missions which could conceivably be subject to a similar malfunction. When we have a failure we will always review the effect of the loss on the program, determine the alternative recovery plans by which we can attain the objectives of the lost mission, assess the cost and any other impact of those alternatives on the program and then decide which alternative to choose.” Vincent L. Johnson, Deputy Administrator for Space Science and Applications, testified June 17: “In the basic considerations which establish the philosophical approach to reliability of unmanned space vehicles, the over-riding necessity for protection of the lives of human passengers is absent. The result is an approach to reliability in which cost and simplicity play a much larger part. We have not imposed a requirement for total elimination of single point failure modes, but have concentrated upon reducing the probability of failure by careful design, parts application, major quality and reliability efforts, and, most importantly, tender loving care. Our launch vehicles . . . are characterized as simplex systems, implying lack of the complexity characteristic of redundancy.” (Testimony; Subcom Rpt, 10/71)

Newsweek commented on “shrinking space shuttle.” U.S. space program had been “hit with another budgetary broadside.” Space shuttle to service planned space station “will get no more than a third of the money its designers insist they need to build it.” Original request for $300 million had been cut by NASA to $225 million. “Now White House budgeteers have shrunk it to $105 million—and it has yet to face the anti-technology faction in Congress.” (Newsweek, 1/25/71)
usn participation in space shuttle program was urged by L/Cdr Preston E.	Beck (usn, Ret.), in U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, usn experience had shown close parallel between life support criteria and fuel management for nuclear submarines and that required for space shuttle. usn Office of Naval Research (onr) and usn Systems Command should determine feasibility of using air entrainment, hydroskis, skids, and hydrofoils to permit sea-level landing point for shuttle spacecraft with one or more engine inoperable after reentry. Sea transport and barge storage of fuels and oxidizers for shuttle spacecraft would ensure safety of flight personnel and minimize interference with commercial air traffic. Space shuttle orbiter and booster structures could be moved only by flyout or by sea because of size. “The obvious answer is final assembly at the launch site using a seaborne logistic system.” Naval Air and Material Center had facilities for development of space shuttle materials, testing of components and subassemblies, and supporting engineering. It seemed pertinent “that the Navy take the initiative in starting to support the space shuttle program. The key to many of the problems now being subjected to resolution is the sea.” (U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, 8/71, 103—5)
Rep. William R. Cotter (D-Conn.) said in release to press that preliminary Gao audit of NR Rocketdyne Div. $24-million Saturn contract had shown “as much as $5 million . . . was diverted to underwrite crucial research on Rocketdyne’s winning design in the $500 million space shuttle main engine contract [awarded Sept. 1].” Cotter said audit, performed at his request, showed “that work performed under the Saturn contract influenced NASA’s Source Selection Board, the group which evaluated the space shuttle designs submitted by Rocketdyne, Pratt & Whitney and Aerojet General.” NASA Assistant Administrator for Industry Affairs and Technology Utilization Daniel J. Harnett later told press NASA audit of space shuttle engine contract had shown “no unfair competition advantage was given to Rocketdyne.” (Text; AP, W Star, 12/19/71, E3)

It was “open secret” that USAF saw space shuttle as “broad highway that will lead to manned military space operations by the United States,” Universal Science News, Inc., said in Dallas Morning News. While “effort to keep NASA’s civilian image seemed so important at one time that the military were allowed to start their own manned orbiting laboratory program, even though NASA has a similar project,” recent budget squeeze had “forced NASA and the Air Force closer together in certain areas.” (Dallas Morning News, 11/22/71)
President Nixon sent $229.2-billion FY 1972 budget request to Congress, including total science r&d budget of $16.7 billion. Total request for NASA new obligation^ authority (noa) of $3,271 billion (1.4% of total U.S. budget) was $27 million less than FY 1971 noa of $3,298 billion. NASA expenditures were budgeted to decline $216.5 million against decline of $486.4 million in FY 1971. Reduction to $3,152 billion placed proposed NASA FY 1972 funding at lowest level since 1962. Of budget request, $2,518 billion would go for r&d, $56.3 million for construction, of facilities, and $697.4 million for research and program management. Apollo funding decrease of $302.2 million, to $612.2 million— reflecting cancellation of Apollo 18 and 19—would be partially offset by increase from $515.2 million in FY 1971 to $672.8 million in FY 1972 for manned space flight operations. Manned space flight operations would include $535.4 million for Skylab, $100.0 million for space shuttle, and $37.4 million for orbited systems and experiments. Advanced missions would receive $1.5 million, to bring total for manned space flight (including Apollo) to $1,286 billion, down $144.6 million from FY 1971. Funding for space science and applications programs would increase $184.7 million, from $565.7 million in FY 1971 to $740.4 million in FY 1972. Increases would go to physics and astronomy program for solar observatory ($19 million in FY 1972), High Energy Astronomical Observatory ($13.4 million), and space telescope study ($500 000). Funding for lunar and planetary exploration would increase $166.6 million, to $311.5 million, with $38.3 million going toward Mariner-Venus/Mercury 1973, $180.4 million toward Viking project, and $18.8 million toward supporting research and technology advanced studies. Funding for Pioneer program of planetary exploration would decrease from $35.5 million in FY 1971 to $17.6 million. Funding for bioscience program, including Biosatellites, was eliminated from NASA budget for FY 1972. Increase of $15.5 million in space applications programs, to $182.5 million in FY 1972, included $48.5 million for Earth Resources Survey, $13 million for Synchronous Meteorological Satellite, and $60.3 million for ATS. Total for advanced research and technology programs decreased from $264.2 million in FY 1971 to $212.8 million, stol technology program would receive $15 million, against $1.9 million in FY 1971. nerva rocket funding would decrease from $32 million in FY 1971 to $9.9 million. Tracking and data acquisition funding would fall $26 million, to $264 million. dod’s FY 1972 budget of $76 billion for outlays included $1.55-billion space funding, $500 000 less than previous year [see April 2]. Budget also included $370 million for B-l intercontinental bomber, up from $75 million in FY 1971; $39 million for lamps antisubmarine-warfare helicopter, up from $4 million, $145 million for air defense aircraft system (awacs), up from $87 million, $47 million for usaf AX close-support aircraft, up from $28 million, $409 million for Poseidon missile system, and $926 million for Minuteman III program, up from $720 million in FY 1971. aec funding for nerva and space electric power would decrease from $84 million in FY 1971 to $39.7 million. Increase of $437 million in total dot FY 1972 budget of $7.8 billion would go mostly to expanded aviation and urban mass transit spending, dot funding for reduction of aircraft noise and study of environmental effects of SST would increase from $27 million in FY 1971 to $54 million. These funds also would he used for pollution reduction from Coast Guard installations, noa of $235 million was requested for sst prototype program, up from $210 million in FY 1971.

Msc engineers were studying use of liquid oxygen and propane as fuel combination for recoverable ballistic booster that was possible vehicle for space shuttle transportation system, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. (Av Wk, 10/25/71,12)
Safety problems of space shuttle were discussed by Director I. Irving Pinkel of LeRC Aerospace Safety Research and Data Institute, in Astronautics & Aeronautics article. “The rocket engine must have an airplane-like endurance of 10 years (100 missions). The airplane systems must operate where rockets do, subject to space vacuum, space radiation, and reentry heating, and still carry a fan engine with high cycle temperature.” (A&A, 12/71, 28-35)
President Nixon approved H.R. 7109, $3.384-billion NASA FY 1972 authorization bill that became P.L. 92-68. Total authorization was $84 million above budget request of $3,300 billion and $86 million above FY 1971 new obligational authority (noa) of $3,298 billion. Bill authorized for R&D $2,603 billion, increase of $85.5 million over budget request of $2,518 billion and decrease of $90 million from FY 1971 authorization of $2,693 billion; for construction of facilities, $58.4 million, up $2.1 million from budget request of $56.3 million and $24 million above FY 1971 authorization of $34.5 million; and for research and program management, $723 million, down $4 million from budget request of $727 million but $40 million above $683.3 million authorized in FY 1971. Bill included $29.3-million budget amendment to cover Federal pay increases. It added $30 million to budget request for Skylab and Space Shuttle programs, $43 million for nuclear power and propulsion, $2.5 million for earth resources survey, and $12.5 million for aeronautical research and technology. It reduced requested authorization for lunar and planetary exploration by $10 million. (PD, 8/9/71, 1136; NASA Budget Off; A&A 1970)
Rising volume in aerospace industry production was predicted by David A. Loehwing in Barrons magazine: “nasa is readying some new programs, notably the space shuttle. . . . Airline revenues are climbing, and some pick-up in orders for transports is anticipated.” dod procurement policies “which nearly threw a few companies into bankruptcy” had been revised. “Most important there is a growing awareness that the Soviet arms buildup poses a real threat to U.S. security, which new weapons must be developed to counter.” Persuasive but “cynical” argument for lift in aerospace business in 1972 was political expediency. “Over half-a-million people have been laid off in the industry since 1968, some 200,000 in California,” state with largest number of electoral votes. Barrons quoted political observer as saying, “Starting pretty early next spring, you’re going to see a massive injection of funds into aerospace.” (Barrons, 12/27/71)
Najeeb E. Halaby, Pan American World Airways President and Chairman, discussed space shuttle at Symposium of Society of Experimental Test Pilots in Los Angeles: “nasa has already shown that it appreciates the contributions airlines can make to the program, by having airlines participate with space contractors in the development of the space shuttle” to “make the eventual space shuttle work more like a standard airliner than a quarterly experiment.” Since it took less energy to orbit objects than to fly them across U.S., “there’s no reason why the cost of Space Shuttle operations should not become as low or lower than that of jets.” Pan Am’s “most glamorous vision” was “Space Shuttle as an air transport, carrying passengers from New York to Tokyo—or Peking—in 45 minutes, or from Los Angeles to Rome in 40.” “We can visualize a rocket-powered vehicle with 100 passengers . . . launched vertically in a suborbital trajectory at the precise azimuth for its intended destination, re-entering the atmosphere without excess g-forces, gliding unpowered to an altitude where its conventional jet engines will be started, then landing on a runway like a conventional airliner.” (Text)
NASA announced availability of Shuttle Technology Program—Fiscal Year 1972, compilation of projects making up NASA FY 1972 Space Shuttle Technology Program, (nasa Release 71—183)
NASA manned space flight officials proposed four-launch program to place astronauts in earth orbit to map U.S., study earth resources, and study pollution, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D.	Myers said in AP-reported interview that program was in preliminary stages and would require additional funding from Congress. MSC Deputy Director Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., said project would keep U.S. in maimed space flight business during period when U.S.S.R. would probably be very active in the field. Project would fill four-year gap between Skylab and manned space shuttle tests. It would also directly benefit mankind, Kraft explained: “The two-man crews will fly at a higher inclination than we’ve ever flown before in earth orbit. Using photographic and other sensing equipment developed in the space program, they could accurately map the entire United States, including Alaska. The astronauts also could make earth resources and environmental measurements.” (AP, W Star,	A16)

Marshall Space Flight Center announced retirement of Director of Program Management Lee B. James, effective May 31. James, who would return to academic community, would be replaced in acting capacity by James T. Shepherd, Deputy Director (Technical), Program Management. (msfc Release 71—77) During April: nasa issued Funds for Research, Development, R&D Plant and Scientific and Technical Information, Fiscal Years 1970—1972: Annual Report to The National Science Foundation. In FY 1972 budget, NASA was seeking authorization of $3,271 billion. Effect on programs would be: Funds for basic research would remain at FY 1970 level in FY 1971 and rise in FY 1972, reflecting increased funding for Viking and initiation of outer planets Grand Tour project. In applied research, estimates for FY 1971 reflected 10% increase over 1970 and slight increase in FY 1972, primarily for earth resources surveys and space station. Budget authority for development activities would decline in 1971 and 1972, primarily as result of completion of Apollo program and reduction in nasa—aec nerva program effort, r&d funds were requested in FY 1972 for space shuttle technology and engine development facilities.

In international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched NATO’s Natosat 2 military comsat for usaf and NATO, Eole Cooperative Applications Satellite for France, Isis 2 cooperative U.S.-Canada ionospheric satellite, and Ariel 4 ionospheric satellite for U.K. Italian crew trained by NASA launched NASA’s Explorer 45 Small Scientific Satellite and Italy’s San Marco 3 from Italian platform off coast of Kenya. Joint NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences meetings on compatible spacecraft rendezvous and docking system progressed to discussion of possible joint test missions. Data obtained by NASA’s Mariner 9 and Soviet Mars 2 and 3 probes were exchanged under agreement that covered broad range of U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space science and applications. Agreement on future exchanges of medical and biological manned space flight data called for meetings between U.S. and Soviet experts at least annually. U.S. and U.S.S.R. exchanged Apollo 11 and 12 and Soviet Luna 16 lunar samples and Soviet scientists were among 750 experts attending Second Annual Lunar Science Conference at Lunar Science Institute in Houston. First U.S.-U.S.S.R. Conference on Communications with Extraterrestrial Intelligence was held in Soviet Armenia. Joint meeting of NASA and European Space Conference (esc) identified candidate areas for possible European participation in U.S. post-Apollo space programs, including design and development of space shuttle subsystems. International Workshop on Earth Resources Survey at Univ. of Michigan was cosponsored by NASA, Dept, of State, usn, and aid to inform representatives of 51 countries and international organizations of latest techniques for interpreting earth resources data acquired by aircraft and satellite remote sensing systems. nasa’s C-130 aircraft equipped with remote-sensing devices participated in U.S. survey of Jamaica’s natural resources undertaken at request of U.N. and Jamaican government. NASA signed agreement with West Germany for series of barium-ion-cloud (bic) probe launches, and new sounding rocket agreement was signed with France. Under sounding rocket agreement, 20 French Centaure and NASA Nike-Cajun rockets would be launched from Kourou Center, French Guiana, in cooperative France-U.S. upper-atmosphere research project. By end of year NASA had entered into cooperative agreements with 39 countries, including agreements on lunar samples, tracking and data acquisition, and geodetic satellite program. Scientists of 87 countries besides U.S. were participating in cooperative ground-based programs and personnel exchanges and 62 countries were exchanging scientific and technical information. Since the beginning of 1962, NASA had launched 21 satellites under international agreements, in addition to flying 21 international experiments on NASA satellites. Since the beginning of the sounding rocket program, 683 cooperative rockets had been launched for research, (nasa Release 71—245; NASA Int Aff; “Selected Statistics on Int’l Affairs,” 2/17/72; A&A, 1971)
Decisions on nasa’s space shuttle program might be politically timed, Aviation Week & Space Technology said. Four contractors would complete study contracts in spring 1972. “At this point, President Nixon— in the midst of his re-election campaign—might publicly state his support for the project.” Selection of winners “of the biggest plum in space” would not be announced until after the November election, magazine said. (Av Wk, 10/25/71, 11)
Future of U.S. space program was subject of articles in America Illustrated, usia publication distributed in U.S.S.R. Jay Holmes described plans for next two decades in space including planetary exploration and Grand Tours of outer space, practical applications of space technology, and international cooperation in space. Technical advancements directly traceable to U.S. space program were described by James J. Haggerty, who forecast additional space benefits in future. Reusable space shuttle and earth-orbiting stations, continued lunar exploration, and manned voyages to Mars were discussed in article on earth, moon, and Mars. (Am III, 2/71)
gao investigation of NASA selection of NR Rocketdyne Div. for prime contract for final design and manufacture of reusable space shuttle [see July 13] was requested by Bruce N. Torell, President of Pratt & Whitney Div. of United Aircraft Corp., in telegram to Elmer B. Staats, U.S. Comptroller General. Bases for protest were that source selection had disregarded objective of the rfp, nasa had failed to conduct “written or oral discussions” on proposals, Pratt & Whitney felt its proposal was “clearly entitled to a superior technical evaluation to the technical proposal of Rocketdyne,” and NASA had failed to give proper consideration to “Pratt & Whitney’s test-proven flight weight design and greater experience.” In letter to Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, nine senators requested that no award of space shuttle engine contract be made until gao investigation had been completed. (CR, 8/6/71, S13789)
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey A. Gromyko signed two nuclear control agreements in formal ceremony at State Dept. Agreements called for improved “hotline” communication between Washington and Moscow via comsats and immediate notification of any unexplained incident involving possible detonation of nuclear weapon which could cause outbreak of nuclear war. (Smith, NYT, 10/1/71, 1) During September: Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, said in interview published by Air Force Magazine that nasa planned to let hardware contracts for space shuttle by spring 1972, contingent on White House approval. NASA had decided in summer to extend preliminary design contracts by four months to “look more intensively at alternative configurations,” examining phased approach for building reusable upper stage first and testing and using it with interim expendable booster, instead of developing reusable booster at same time. Reevaluation of design concepts was stirred by need for additional analyses and research and by need to trim expenditures “in a given year.” nasa’s viewpoint on space in this decade was “to bring the program down to earth, both figuratively and literally. We must ask ourselves the question: Is what we are doing useful in alleviating our problems on the ground?” Crucial criteria of each prospective space program were “whether it will pay for itself by doing useful work; whether it can be expected to produce valuable scientific knowledge that can only be obtained from space; whether it is important to national security; and whether it will catalyze valuable new technologies or lead' to other practical results.” For shuttle “answers to all these questions is 100 percent affirmative.” (AF Mag, 9/71, 53-61)
National Urban Coalition released Counterbudget—A Blueprint for Changing National Priorities, 1971-1976. Report noted diminishing public support for science and technology and recommended 4% increase in r&d funding to prevent deterioration of Government’s role in science and technology in national affairs. Space program should be kept at funding level just over $3 billion, rather than $5.9-billion level reached in 1966. Space shuttle and station programs should be continued but on stretched schedule. Mars mission should be undertaken only when it could be done internationally. Value of space program as whole lay in its scientific yield, practical results, and national leadership. (CR, 5/21/71, E4836-98; nuc pio)
NASA leaders were “realistic enough to sense that their case for the [space] shuttle must be built on more than chauvinistic appeal to national prestige, which sold the Apollo in the early 1970s,” Jonathan Spivak said in Wall Street Journal. They were “working hard to trim the shuttle’s prospective costs, demonstrate its economic payoff and convince the scientific community that it offers attractive new opportunities for research.” But NASA’s “primary problem” was “convincing the public and the politicians that it still makes sense to go into space at all. The moon is no longer a glamorous goal; Mars is too far distant and expensive, and orbiting space stations to date have made few influential converts.” (WSJ, 6/30/71, 10) During June: Skylab was described in article by Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, in Astronautics & Aeronautics: “By far the largest manned spacecraft we have ever built, Skylab will be the forerunner of permanent stations in space. In orbit 435 km [270 mi] above Earth, the Skylab cluster will be 36 meters [118 ft] long and will weigh 82 238 kilograms [181304 lbs]. One of its major components will be a workshop with 362 cubic meters [474 cu yds] of work area. Other parts will include a Multiple Docking Adapter, Airlock Module, Apollo Command and Service Module, and an Apollo Telescope Mount, the last of these a full-fledged solar observatory capable of observing, monitoring, and recording phenomena on the Sun’s surface that cannot be seen from Earth.” Skylab would carry from earth orbit “about 50 scientific, medical, applications, and solar-astronomy experiments. Twenty of these will be in the life sciences, to determine how man performs and adjusts under conditions of prolonged space flight. The study of materials and manufacturing will be another area of interest. By means of an electron-beam generating device and an electric furnace, metals will be melted, molded, and welded, and other metallurgy and crystal tests performed in a work chamber exposed to zero-gravity and the vacuum of space.” (A&A, 6/71, 20-1)
Selection of NR Rocketdyne Div. for negotiations leading to award of 8500-million, cost-plus-award-fee contract for development and delivery of 35 space shuttle engines by 1978 was announced by nasa. Selection followed 12-mo competition during which nasa had accepted proposals from three firms on April 21. Program would be managed by msfc and would support space shuttle orbital flights beginning in 1978. (nasa Release 71-131)
Pratt & Whitney Div. of United Aircraft Corp. filed formal protest against nasa award of $500-million space shuttle main engine contract to NR Rocketdyne Div. and asked Federal Government to reverse award. In letter to Gao, Pratt & Whitney charged selection of Rocketdyne was “illegal, arbitrary and capricious, and based on unsound decisions” and reiterated complaints cited Aug. 3 to gao.

McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. began 14-mo, $350 000 study continuation for system definition of reusable nuclear stage (rns) for multipurpose space missions. Previous studies had determined that RNS could he launched by either Saturn or space shuttle booster. New study would focus on RNS concepts to be launched by space shuttle, but would consider two-stage, fully reusable shuttle, shuttle booster with expendable 2nd stage, and launch of RNS as complete unit or with components to be assembled in space. Study also would support nerva program, (msfc Release 71-174)

rand Corp. report The Space Shuttle as an Element in the National Space Program (RM 6244-1PR) completed in October 1970—study that questioned economic feasibility of nasa’s reusable space shuttle program—was entered in Congressional Record by Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.) Study, undertaken for usaf, concluded “total space funding requirements over the next 20 years are not significantly different for plans that use the shuttle and those that accomplish the same missions without the shuttle.” Results indicated “that criteria other than cost should be used to evaluate the desirability of the space transport system.” {CR, 5/26/71, S7823-9)
Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, testified on aerospace unemployment before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1972 authorization hearings: From number of studies of unemployment of scientists and engineers, estimated 30 000 to 40 000 were out of work at end of 1970. “The majority of these came from aerospace-related industries. Projections indicate that this number could more than double by June 1972, which means that as many as 30 percent of the Nation’s aerospace scientists and engineers will be unemployed. The effect of this national trend—in terms of an individual scientist or engineer being reemployed—is magnified by the concentration of this unemployment, geographically and by training and experience. . . . This not only causes great personal hardship but . . . represents the loss of a tremendous national resource.” NASA-sponsored survey by Battelle Memorial Institute of persons laid off by group of nasa contractors from June 1968 to September 1970 had made preliminary findings: only 31% had found permanent jobs, 32% had found temporary jobs, 32% were still unemployed, and 5% had left work-force. Average person was unemployed 31 weeks. Of those who had found permanent jobs, only 18% returned to aerospace. Of those permanently employed outside of aerospace, only 12% reported having positions highly related to aerospace skills and 50% reported new positions unrelated to aerospace. Unemployment rate of those over 50 was 48%. Of those who had found permanent work outside, 31% said they would not return to aerospace if given opportunity; 16% said they would. Preliminary results of survey indicated “we are losing much of the aerospace capability that is an indispensable ingredient of our long term economic strength and national security.” In closing, Dr. Low made point that there was “no either/or choice between technological advances and social advances. Without technology, we cannot maintain the capability to deal effectively with any national problem.” Dr. Low was questioned on his testimony that U.S.S.R. was spending more on R&D than U.S. was spending in total science and technology area. He answered that Soviet space program, with apparent Soviet policy of steadily increasing r&d investment, would soon match and then surpass U.S. program in size and accomplishment. “For this comparison, I am dealing with the combined civil and military space programs of both nations; to try to differentiate between civil and military activities of the U.S.S.R. would be speculative at best. The most difficult comparison to try to make between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. economies or programs is in terms of absolute costs: each national economy is geared and motivated to produce a different, nonparallel mix of goods and services.” (CR, 7/31/71, E8611—2) Dale D. Myers, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, discussed future of Apollo program: “We can now move with confidence to the final phase. ... In these last missions, we will expand the capability of the system very dramatically. Design changes in the spacecraft and supporting equipment will allow the two astronauts in the lunar module to remain on the moon up to 67 hours, as compared with 34 hours on Apollo 14. The scientific payload landed on the moon will be doubled to above 1200 lbs [544 kg]. Changes in the command and service modules will permit up to 10 days total flight time and major increases in orbital scientific activities. During the Apollo 15 and 16 missions small subsatellites will be placed in lunar orbit and will continue to make scientific measurements long after the astronauts return to earth.” In Skylab program, “three separate three-man Skylab flight crews will be selected during the coming year. Scientist astronauts will be included. . . . They plan to perform about 50 experiments in various disciplines. Twenty of these are in the life sciences, to determine how human beings adjust and perform under the conditions of prolonged space flight, up to 2 months’ duration. “They will also operate the Skylab Earth Resources Experiment Package in the second space flight phase of NASA’s earth resources program. These observations will be in conjunction with [and] complementary to those [of] the automated earth resources test technology erts, to be launched in 1972.” FY 1972 request for space shuttle of $100 million would provide for broad spectrum of studies, including analysis of new alloys and promising external materials for thermal protection; test demonstrations of design concepts for structures; wind-tunnel tests to define aerodynamic heating, launch aerodynamics, etc.; design of long-leadtime hardware, subsystems, and test devices; initiation of scaled model for flight tests; dynamics testing; electronic-data-bus-system demonstration testing; and integration of upgraded fuel-cell electrical power subsystem with other components for proof-of-concept testing. (Transcript) Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, testified on dod applications of space transportation system and dod-nasa teamwork on space shuttle: “Present dod satellite communications program consists of two major systems: The long distance point to point or strategic system and the local-area multiple-user or tactical system. . . . We are pursuing a new system called Defense Satellite Communications System, Phase II, which can provide many voice channels to selected limited areas of the earth. These present and proposed systems give us the flexibility for voice and teletype communications from our forces overseas and allow rapid transmission of photographic images from operational theaters to the United States.” In conjunction with NASA studies, usaf was analyzing defense applications of space shuttle to provide better insight into utility of concept for dod. usaf was providing NASA with data to help ensure that configuration was of maximum utility to dod. nasa and usaf had worked jointly on engine development. Air Force “has supported advanced development efforts on liquid rocket engines in the past, and more recently concluded a hydrogen/oxygen high performance engine demonstration program.” Engine, XLR-129, had “provided the basis for selection of the reusable high pressure rocket engine concept for the shuttle. It also provided design data for a 250 000-pound [1100-kilonewton] thrust engine which supports the current shuttle engine design concepts.” In operational testing area, “usaf and NASA recently conducted unpowered approach and landing demonstrations with F—Ills and B-52s. . . . These demonstrations investigated terminal area energy management for maneuvering reentry vehicles and have a relationship to the Space Shuttle operational concepts.” (Transcript)
Editorial in Aviation Week & Space Technology commented on rejection by Government of further sst funding: “The fate of the sst should serve notice . . . that the aerospace industry can no longer survive with its political naivete and aloofness from the fray.” It was “sad day when a deliberate national decision is made to abandon a major frontier of technological advance. But it will be even sadder when the victors in this significant debate gird for their next assault on the space shuttle program.” (Hotz, Av Wk, 3/29/71, 9)
NASA received design patents No. 220 980 through 220 985 for early conceptual designs of space shuttle. Inventors were employees of Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and North American Rockwell Corp. Space Div. (Jones, NYT, 6/26/71; Patent Off pio)
Results to date of study to determine minimum cockpit visibility required by space shuttle pilot to make safe horizontal ground landings were announced by FRC. Tests, begun in July with instrumented T—33 jet aircraft with radar system to judge accurate altitude to within two feet (0.6 meters), had shown pilots could land aircraft with greater visibility restrictions than expected. Visibility restriction of 5° had been extended to 75° on either side, or total of 150° in 225 approaches flown. Restrictions would be increased in future to 160°. (frc Release 26-71)
Dale D. Myers, Nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics during hearings on nasa FY 1972 authorization bill: “With the Apollo 14 scientific instruments operating properly, we now have begun to develop the networks of instrumentation at different locations on the lunar surface which will allow us to use normal triangulation procedures to establish the details of the moon’s structure. We have two passive seismometers and two suprathermal ion detectors in operation, one each at the Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 sites, about 115 miles [185 km] apart. Last week severed moonquakes were reported . . . when the moon reached its perigee. Our instruments pinpointed the location of these events . . . close to the Fra Mauro crater area. “We also have a laser ranging retroflector at the Apollo 11 Tranquility Base and another at Fra Mauro—750 miles [1200 km] apart. The laser ranging team at the MacDonald Observatory in Texas has reported high-quality returns from the Apollo 14 reflector. As the world’s observatories refine their ability to use these instruments, we hope that they will be able to detect random wobbles of the earth’s rotational axis. If so, this may contribute to the ability to predict major earthquakes.” During past year, design and essentially all phases of development testing had been completed for Skylab and flight hardware was in fabrication. Definition of space shuttle was nearing completion. To develop limited capability to rescue Skylab astronauts from space, NASA had initiated design action on modification kit to give Skylab CM capacity to carry two men up to orbit and five men back to earth. Stranded astronauts could use Skylab cluster as shelter while modification kit was installed and Apollo-Saturn IB launch vehicle assigned to next revisit was made ready for launch. (Transcript)

International aspects of U.S. space program were discussed by Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, in luncheon speech before National Space Club in Washington, D.C.: Cooperation with Western nations in past decade had included 70 countries, 250 specific agreements, and more than 24 joint satellite projects at run-out cost in excess of $400 million. More than 50% of total had been funded by other nations. In 1970s, “opportunities exist for cooperation on a significantly larger scale.” U.S. wished “to build a foundation for important benefit- and cost-sharing in the major space programs of the future.” Canada, Japan, and Australia—“countries having the most obvious potential for post-Apollo work-sharing”—had been given “every chance to become fully acquainted with our plans and studies” to enable them to decide whether they wished to commit their own resources. European Space Conference had put several million dollars into studies of post-Apollo program possibilities and some member countries had invested still larger amounts. British, French, and West German firms were working with NASA prime contractors on space shuttle design studies. Europe would have to choose between significant participation in shuttle funding and funding independent European rocket program. Decision would be necessary “even if Europe funds only 10 per cent of the shuttle’s price tab.” U.S. had said it would “sell launch services for projects consistent with peaceful purposes and existing international agreements . . . [and] that general technical access to the entire program would be available, but that technology at the level of commercial know-how would be transferred in either direction only where one side required it to complete its commitments to the other.” Since Europe was talking of only 10% share of shuttle program, “we said that we would retain decision-making responsibility except where European costs were directly affected, in which case decisions would be joint.” In U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space, “it is particularly important that we give clear recognition to both . . . competition and cooperation.” U.S. was competing with U.S.S.R. “because accomplishments in space represent a measure of the state of our technology; and in today’s world, the level of our technology is of first importance, strategically, economically, and politically.” U.S. was cooperating with U.S.S.R. “because we both live in a vast universe that must be explored, where important new knowledge is to be gained, for the benefit of all men, everywhere.” While U.S. retained demonstrated lead over U.S.S.R., “it will not be an enduring lead without major new initiatives on our part— initiatives like the space shuttle and the exploration of the outer planets. . . .” In Jan. 18—21 Moscow talks with Soviet Academy of Sciences, “we specifically agreed, initially, to exchange three grams [0.11 oz] of sample obtained from Luna 16, for three grams each from Apollo 11 and 12. These relatively small amounts are sufficient for detailed scientific examination of a comparative nature.” Additional meetings on compatible docking arrangements had not been held because “docking discussions are well underway, and the planned exchange of information is taking place.” On visit to Soviet cosmonaut training area at Star City, “we were welcomed by Cosmonauts Beregovoy, Nikolayev, Leonov, Shatalov, and Valentina Tereshkova. We were shown the Soyuz mission trainer, and were invited to attempt to dock two Soyuz spacecraft in their docking trainer. While there, I also presented a plaque in memory of Yuri Gagarin [first man in space] from the U.S. astronauts.” (Text) • President Nixon announced appointments of members of President’s Science Advisory Committee for terms expiring Dec. 31, 1974: Dr. Lee A.

NASA released Jan. 28 briefing on FY 1972 budget request, in which Dr. George M. Low, NASA Acting Administrator, said: “For the past several years we have reported ... a further decrease in budget authority. This year we can report a clear halt in this trend: the budget authority for FY 1972 is at the same level as the funds appropriated for FY 1971. The exact figure for FY 1972 is $3,271 billion. NASA would complete Apollo program with four previously planned missions but would delay Apollo 17 five months to ensure that mission carried experiments originally scheduled for canceled Apollo 18 and 19. Skylab missions would be delayed about four months, to follow as soon as practical after last Apollo flight. Plans for unmanned planetary exploration included two Mars orbiters in 1971, Jupiter flybys in 1972 and 1973, launch in 1973 for Venus-Mercury flyby in 1974, and two Viking launches in 1975 to land on Mars in 1976. Dr. Low said NASA had asked for $190 million for space shuttle in FY 1972. “We have included in our budget $100 million. This reduction means essentially that we will move out with the engine development exactly as we had planned; that we are still in a position to make a decision after we have completed the studies on the air frame development, whether to continue with additional design or whether to proceed with the development of the air frames.” Near-earth science programs included Orbiting Solar Observatories in 1971, 1973, 1974, and 1975 and last orbiting Astronomical Observatory in 1972. Space applications program would progress as planned, including two erts, two Nimbus experimental weather satellites, two Synchronous Weather Satellites, and two advanced communications experiments with ATS—F and ATS—G. New FY 1972 projects would include start of work on High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) and program for exploration of outer planets. “To do this we will develop a versatile new spacecraft, and we will plan Grand Tour missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-1977; and to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, in 1979.” NASA also would study mission to orbit Jupiter as alternative to first Grand Tour. Major new initiative in aeronautics in FY 1972 would be development of experimental stol aircraft. Downward trend in aerospace industry employment on NASA programs would be halted during FY 1972. “Although aerospace jobs will continue to decline in FY 1971, we expect employment to start increasing by the middle of FY 1972, with the end-of-year level being about equal to that at the beginning of the year.” NASA would reduce civil service work force by 1500 positions by end of FY 1972, bringing total decrease to 6800 since July 1967. Work on NERVA nuclear rocket engine would be limited to “essentially long-lead time items,” preserving ability “to move forward . . . when the need arises,” without large expenditures in FY 1972. Program included “no plans at this time for a manned Mars landing mission.” (Transcript)

Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) on Senate floor questioned need for space shuttle and space station: “I have written to NASA on a number of occasions to ask whether . . . there is a need for the space shuttle-space station. All nasa has told me in reply is that first, the shuttle would enable us to continue to have an active space program, and second, it would reduce the costs of the space program. But why do we actually need it? What would it help us to accomplish that we could not otherwise accomplish? NASA seemingly has no answer to these questions.” (CR, 5/26/71, S7811—2)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified before Senate Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on hud, Space, and Science during hearings on NASA FY 1972 appropriations bill. He urged that “strong program in space and aeronautics is essential to our longterm national well-being. Our capabilities as a Nation to deal with domestic problems of high priority—poverty, cities, the environment . . . and indeed, our pursuit of happiness and cultural advance—ultimately depend on whether we can maintain a strong economy with continually increasing productivity. Increasing productivity, in turn, depends primarily on technological advance, which, in turn, results primarily from the large scale focussed technological efforts like our major space programs.” In addition were both long-term and near-term direct benefits, many already realized. “When 50,000 lives were saved as a result of satellite advance warning at the time of hurricane Camille, the space program probably paid for itself.. . . “I believe that the space program is a value in itself to the nation and to the whole world. With our everyday preoccupation, necessarily, with the many serious and often depressing problems we face . . . there is, I believe, a human hunger for positive elevating goals to work for at the same time as we do what needs to be done in all these other difficult areas. I believe the strong attraction that the landing of the first man on the moon had on people everywhere, and much of the underlying basis of support in the country for the space program, stems from the fact that the space program provides such goals. The space program gives us goals seemingly beyond human capability, goals which transcend earthly boundaries.” Space shuttle had tremendous impact for future because it not only reduced cost by being reusable itself, but it also gave options of reusing payloads. “You do not have to throw them away once you put them up there. . . . There are many more application satellites we can use with this kind of an arrangement, because we will be able to reuse them.” Skylab, “first and only NASA experimental space station,” due to fly in 1973, would be “larger but 2 years later than the Soviet Salyut now in orbit.” U.S.S.R. probably would be able to “do things in space, laboratories, 2 years earlier than we ... to know what the earth is like, to know what the clouds are like, to understand more about the earth’s resources. . . . Another aspect, which I am uncertain about, is what they plan to do in a military way. . . . they will have the potential of doing military things on this same vehicle. We do not plan to do this on the Skylab. We also must consider the scientific value of Salyut, which I think is important, but not as important to us as the applications and the military aspects of it.” Associate Administrator for Organization and Management Richard C. McCurdy testified that “models” of anticipated further reduction of 1500 civil service positions in fall “indicate that we have reached a point in which really good people of considerable experience will be going out the door. Certain parts of our operations will be closed. This means that we have come to a place where reductions in force are eating into our capability to do the job.” (Transcript)

Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, enumerated major factors relevant to nasa FY 1973 budget request in speech before aiaa National Capital Section: 1. “Program continuity must be maintained.” NASA could not “shut down major programs for several years and then start them up again efficiently.” 2. NASA programs had helped stabilize U.S. aerospace industry. “This is a very significant reason for maintaining NASA programs up to or near current levels at this time.” 3. NASA would reach minimum “institutional base” requirement for efficient management of approved programs in current fiscal year. “I will strongly resist any further reductions.” 4. Space shuttle was “next logical step to develop our national capabilities for using space more economically and more effectively with manned and unmanned spacecraft, for both civilian and defense purposes.” 5. U.S. was lagging behind in development of new technology for commercial and military aviation. “We killed the sst while Britain and France went ahead to build the Concorde, and the Soviet Union built a competing version. The Europeans—and our Canadian neighbors—are ahead of us in Short Take Off and Landing Aircraft. The question must be asked, how long can we, as a great nation, afford to be mere spectators while others move ahead in aircraft technology?” nasa did not intend “to shift the gears of our space program into the ‘park’ position; we are geared up for continued steady and impressive progress in those areas of space activity which we consider most rewarding scientifically or most important to our national security.” Within few years “there will be no time of day or night, year in and year out, when men are not working in orbit above the earth. And it is up to us, in decisions to be made this year in this capital, whether these men in orbit will include Americans.” (Text)
NASA announced selection of Mississippi Test Facility near New Orleans, La., as site for sea-level testing of space shuttle rocket engines. Testing under simulated altitude conditions would be done at usaf’s Arnold Engineering Development Center at Tullahoma, Tenn. Test program would include some 1200 development and acceptance tests from 1973 through 1979, with 45 to 50 sustaining engineering tests per year afterward, and some 100 development tests under simulated altitude conditions from 1974 through 1976. Site Evaluation Board had selected sites after surveying existing Government-owned or controlled properties. Space shuttle engine would be reusable, high-performance, high-chamber-pressure engine using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. First stage would be larger than J-2 engine in Saturn V, with 249 500kg (550000-lb) thrust. Orbiter stage engine would have extendable nozzle skirt for use in space, (nasa Release 71—30)

NASA was looking at air bases in the Carolinas, south Florida, and the Bahamas as possible landing site for space shuttle rocket launched from KSC, UPI said in Philadelphia Inquirer. NASA engineers also were considering refueling shuttle booster’s 1st stage in flight so that it could return to launch site for landing, like aircraft. (P lnq,
Dr. George M. Low, Acting nasa Administrator, presented nasa FY 1972 budget request to House Committee on Science and Astronautics: FY 1972 projects—including Apollo 15 and 16, two Mariner spacecraft, first erts satellite, and continuing work toward future flights of Apollo 17, Skylab, earth resources and ats satellites, and Viking probes —represented “the fulfillment of enterprises of the 1960’s, the tailing off to completion of work in progress for many years. By 1974 the number of nasa space launches per year will have declined from 26 in 1966 to eight. After the Skylab missions in 1973, we face at least 4 years in which there will be no United States manned space flight. “Five years ago there were over 390 000 people in industry employed on nasa work. By the end of fiscal year 1971 that figure will be about 108 000. The decline will continue for a few more months, but we expect it to start increasing by the middle of fiscal year 1972, with the end-of-the-year total being about equal to that at the beginning.” U.S. was “running a serious risk of losing too much of the aerospace capability that is an essential ingredient of our long term national strength and security.” There was every indication U.S. would lose leadership in space “unless we move forward now with our space programs for the 1970’s. In 1970 the Soviets launched 88 payloads into space compared to . . . 36 for the United States. Their r&d budget is continuing to increase. They have seldom missed a launch window in the exploration of Venus and Mars while we have many gaps in our planetary program. We would expect them to use automated vehicles and sample return spacecraft from the planets, while we have no such program. Finally the Soviets have a systematic continuing manned space flight program and have stated that they expect to fly a space station before we do.” U.S. should continue to compete with U.S.S.R. “because accomplishments in space represent a measure of the state of our technology; and in today’s world, the level of our technology is of first importance, strategically, economically, and politically.” Dr. Low believed U.S. could cooperate with U.S.S.R. “in the areas we have under discussion without prejudicing any of our vital national interests.” nasa was reexamining procurement policies and practices and “beginning a serious critical appraisal of the proper size, composition, and organization of NASA’s institutional base.” Position reduction of 1500 in FY 1972 budget was in anticipation that “reduction of this magnitude would be found possible without unduly impairing our ability to carry out the program. Our budget justifications show this reduction as a flat percentage cut—about 5.1%—in all of our major activities. The actual adjustments . . . will be refined as our study of the nasa institutional base proceeds.” nasa program was 1.4% of U.S. budget, contrasting with 53% for domestic programs related to human and physical resources, yet U.S. stood to gain “tremendous benefits now and in the future” from exploration and applications of space science and technology. And whole future “as a nation and as mankind” depended on space science. “For in order to survive in the changing environment on our planet Earth, we must understand the processes that govern our universe.” Dr. Wernher von Braun, Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, said purpose of nasa Meteorology Program was to “develop and demonstrate sensors and spacecraft for making those meteorological measurements that will enable a continued improvement in weather forecasting throughout the world with an ultimate view to a limited degree of weather modification and control of severe weather systems. Projections indicate that by about 1980 it should be possible to reach a global capability to acquire information throughout the atmosphere and to develop comprehensive weather models. Once developed, these models can be used to make 14-day weather forecasts and long-range climate estimates.” Ability to develop weather models would permit basic experimenting in weather control. Space shuttle was key nasa development believed essential in 1970s, Dr. von Braun said, presenting U.S. with its greatest technology challenge for space in this decade. “Preliminary analysis indicates that if the shuttle is used in lieu of current expendable systems, the transportation costs will be reduced by at least a factor of ten. . . . Only by an investment now will we be able to have operational an economical transportation system by the end of the 1970’s to support a vigorous and balanced space flight program.” (Transcript)
Dr. George M. Low, Acting nasa Administrator, testified before House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on HUD-Space-Science in support of nasa FY 1972 budget request: “We have recently settled on a single set of performance characteristics for the preliminary design of the two-stage fully reusable [space] shuttle. Alternate approaches are also still under study. We expect to be in a position to make decisions this summer on how we will proceed with airframe design or development in FY 1972. The $100 million recommended in the FY 1972 budget will support, in addition to the engine development, either continued intensive design studies and related efforts or the initiation of airframe development.” Dr. Low noted “tremendous interest in exploration during Apollo 11, when an estimated 107 million people in the U.S. watched our first manned lunar landing mission; and we saw it again last month, when 104 million watched Apollo 14.” (Text)
