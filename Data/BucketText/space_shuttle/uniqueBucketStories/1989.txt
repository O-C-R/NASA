Antinuclear activists in Florida protested the launch aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis next month of the Galileo space probe, which would carry two plutoniumfueled radioisotope thermoelectric generators. The protesters claimed an accident aboard the Atlantis similar to the Challenger explosion could contaminate large parts of Florida and lead to hundreds of cancerrelated deaths. NASA and the White House maintained that the0*chances of a plutonium leak in the event of an accident was negligible. Galileo was scheduled to reach Jupiter in late 1995.

A launch attempt of the Space Shuttle Atlantis was scrubbed 31 seconds before scheduled liftoff because of a power surge on a pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen fuel for one of the Shuttle main engines. Shuttle technicians were working to replace the pump and a leaky fuel line that was discovered after the scrub. A new launch attempt was expected to be made as early as Thursday.

President George Bush chose the name "Endeavour" for the new Space Shuttle orbiter being built to replace the orbiter Challenger. The name "Endeavour" resulted from a nationwide orbiternaming competition supported by educational projects created by student teams in elementary and secondary schools. Endeavour was the name of the first ship commanded by James Cook, a British explorer, navigator, and astronomer. Cook commanded the Endeavour on its maiden voyage to the South Pacific on an astronomical and mapping mission. The new orbiter, designated OV105, was scheduled to be completed in 1991 and to fly its maiden voyage in March 1992. (NASA Release 8970, May 10/89)
