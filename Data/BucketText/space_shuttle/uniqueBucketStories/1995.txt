Launch of Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-73). During the mission Columbia provided a calm, stable platform for 16 days of on-orbit research using the Microgravity Laboratory (USML-2) Spacelab that consisted of over 40 fluid-physics, material science, and biotechnology experiments. Columbia landed on November 5. Columbia�s window was nicked by space debris. The Space Shuttle also received a 1 cm crater in its cargo bay door, the biggest impact to date.

Launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-69). It deployed and retrieved two scientific spacecraft. One was the second flight of the Wake Shield Facility-2, a 12-foot diameter disk for growing semiconductor films. The other was the Spartan 201 on its third flight. Its mission was to study the outer atmosphere of the Sun and its transition into the solar wind that constantly flows past the Earth.

NASA expects to select a single prime contractor for its Space Shuttle program within a year and turnover shuttle operations in 1998. (W Post, Aug 22/95; USA Today, Aug 22/95; Space News, Aug 28/95; WSJ, Aug 22/95; AP, Aug 21/95; UPI, Aug 21/95; AvWk, Aug 28/95)
Launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-67) on a 17-day mission. The mission included the use of three unique ultraviolet telescopes mounted on the Astro 2 observation platform. It built on the findings of Astro�s first flight in December, 1990, when the Instrument Pointing System was balky.
