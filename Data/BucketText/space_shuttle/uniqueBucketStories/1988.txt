A Wet Countdown Demonstration Test (WCDT) of the Space Shuttle Discovery's External Tank (ET) was conducted following several unplanned holds as a result of problems with ground support equipment. The WCDDT, carried out with Discovery deployed for launch at the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39B, consisted of loading the ET with liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen in mock preparation for a Shuttle launch. (NASA STS26 Press Kit)
NASA announced that it would remove and inspect the liquid oxygen turbopumps aboard the Shuttle Discovery, a move that was expected to delay Discovery's launch beyond the scheduled date of August 4. The pumps will be inspected to ensure that critical bolts in the devices are properly tightened and have not been stripped. Delays resulting from the inspection are expected to push back Discovery's launch date until late August. (UPI, Apr 2/88; W Post, Apr 3/88; USA Today, Apr 4/88; P Inq, Apr 4/88)
After an aborted first attempt on August 4, a 22second flight readiness firing (FRF) of the Space Shuttle Discovery's main engines was conducted on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space0*Center's Launch Complex 39B. The first FRF attempt had been halted inside the T10 second mark because of a sluggish fuel bleed valve on the number 2 main engine. The faulty valve was replaced prior to the FRF.

The Space Shuttle Atlantis was rolled out to Launch Pad 39B for a scheduled launch in late November of STS27, a classified Department of Defense mission.

It was announced in a recent NASA press briefing that there had been a total of 230 reported "close calls" since the Challenger accident. A "close call" was defined by NASA as an incident in which there is no injury, no damage, and no impact on schedule, but which possesses the potential for a more serious mishap. (NASA Release 12988)
EG&G Florida, Inc. was awarded a $635,529 contract to make modifications to the Space Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF). This work would include grinding a 3,500foot section at each end of the runway to smooth the surface texture, removing cross grooves and adding longitudinal "corduroy grooving." Additionally, existing landing zone light fixtures were to be modified and markings on the entire runway and overruns repainted. These modifications were intended to enhance landing safety by reducing Space Shuttle orbiter tire wear during landing operations. The SLF is 15,000 feet long and 300 feet wide, with a 1,000foot paved safety overrun at each end. Work was scheduled to begin January 26 and be completed by midMarch 1988. (NASA Release 8810)
A Space Systems Development Agreement was signed by NASA and Spacehab, Inc., a private firm that was developing a Shuttlebased pressurized module for commercial applications. According to the agreement, NASA agreed to provide Shuttle payload bay space for Spacehab's middeck augmentation module on six Shuttle flights beginning in 1991. Spacehab would pay $28.2 million (adjusted for inflation) for standard services for each flight. The Spacehab module, to be constructed by McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company, Huntsville, Alabama, would be a metal truncated cylinder measuring 10 feet in length by 13 feet in diameter, designed to fit in the Shuttle's cargo bay. Shuttle crew members would access the module through a tunnel from the Shuttle's middeck. The company would make available to customers a variety of locker and rack accommodations, with associated support and integration services. Spacehab was specifically identified in the President's Commercial Space Initiative, announced in February, in which the Reagan administration committed to make the best efforts to launch the commercial module in the early 1990s.(NASA Release 88114)
