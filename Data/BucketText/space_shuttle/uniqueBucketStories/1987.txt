NASA announced that the three Space Shuttle main engines are undergoing acceptance testing at its National Space Technology Laboratories in Mississippi. The Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International performed the tests. The engines tested were to be used in the next Shuttle mission, STS26, scheduled for launch in June 1988. The tests were to be completed in December 1987. (NASA Release 87130; CSM, Sept 5/87)
NASA and West Germany signed a cooperative Earthh)!0*0*0*observation agreement. Under the agreement, West Germany, together with Italy, was to provide an Xband synthetic aperture radar (XSAR) to fly with the spaceborne imaging radarc (SIRC) on the Space Shuttle. The SIRC will allow the Shuttleborne imaging radar mission to view a site from different angles and at different radar frequencies. An advanced XSAR was expected to combine later with the NASA Earth Observation System to fly on a NASA polar platform, providing a third frequency to the combined mission. (NASA Release 87149)
NASA announced that secondary payloads for the next Space Shuttle mission would include five microgravity experiments, life sciences, atmospheric science and infrared communications experiments, as well as two student experiments. (NASA Release 87144)
NASA said it had completed negotiations with Rockwell International Corporation for a new Space Shuttle. The new space vehicle, to replace the Challenger lost in the 1986 accident, was expected to be delivered in April 1991. The cost of the new Space Shuttle was estimated at $1.3 billion.

The NASA Advisory Council recommended that the space agency acquire a diversified fleet of expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) to preserve the Space Shuttle for missions requiring unique capabilities. (NASA Release 8730)
