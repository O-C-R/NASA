Space Shuttle Mission STS-45 was designated for the first flight of the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS-1). The ATLAS-1 was to measure long-term variability in the total energy radiated by the sun and measure the Earth's middle atmospheric constituents over one 11-year solar cycle. (NASA Note N92-14)
Explorers reported that the lost city of Ubar, called "the Atlantis of the Sands" by Lawrence of Arabia, had been found in Oman using pictures taken from the Space Shuttle Challenger in October 1984. The city was thought to have been inhabited from 2800 B.C. until A.D. 100. (USA Today, Feb 5/92; W Times, Feb 5/92; P Inq, Feb 5/92; NY Times International, Feb 5/92; B Sun, Feb 5/92)
NASA announced that Dr. Chiaki Mukai of the Japanese National Space Development Agency had been designated as the prime payload specialist for the second International Microgravity Laboratory mission scheduled for launch aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in July 1994. She was to be the first Japanese woman to take part in a U.S. space shuttle mission. Dr. Jean-Jacques Favier, a scientist with the French Atomic Energy Commission, was selected as an alternate payload specialist. (NASA Release 92-173; UPI, Oct 20/92)
NASA announced that more than 700 researchers from around the world would convene on March 16-20, 1992, at Johnson Space Center's (JSC) Gilruth Center in Houston, Texas for five days of discussions on research on the universe, with much of the focus on Venus and findings from NASA's Magellan probe. Magellan, deployed from the Space Shuttle Atlantis in 1989, has mapped about 97 percent of the Venusian surface with its remote sensing cameras. An overview of the Magellan program called "Magellan at Venus: The Global Perspective Emerges," start was scheduled to the conference on March 6, 1992. (NASA Note N92-19)

A company spokesman for Rockwell Corporation said that NASA was negotiating with Rockwell to build spare parts in the Antelope Valley for the Space Shuttle program. Rockwell was negotiating the terms of a $55 million contract to build a midbody fuselage and a tail for the Space Shuttle fleet. The work would be performed in the hanger where the company built all of the Space Shuttles for NASA. Work would begin with 70 employees and was expected to last until 1999. (Daily News, May 18/92)

A division of Rockwell International agreed to pay $1.42 million and to permit the federal government to lecture employees about honesty to settle a fraud case involving Space Shuttle work. Prosecutors said they would drop charges that Rockwell's Collins Commercial Avionics Division in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which makes and repairs Shuttle flight instruments, had defrauded NASA by altering time cards for work done on the Shuttle program.

The Space Shuttle returned to earth with its seven-member crew, two Japanese carp, four frogs and assorted tadpoles, hornets, and flies. This was the first Shuttle flight devoted to Japanese research. (NY Times, Sept 21/92; P Inq, Sept 21/92; The Sun, Sept 21/92; W Times, Sept 20/92, Sept 21/92; W Post, Sept 20/92, Sept 21/92; AP, Sept 20/92, Sept 21/92; UPI, Sept 21/92; USA Today, Sept 21/92; LA Times, Sept 21/92)
The Justice Department accused a large military electronics maker of falsifying results of tests on sophisticated weapons and spacecraft, including the Space Shuttle. The department joined a $250 million civil lawsuit that accused Teledyne Relays, a Teledyne Inc. unit, of falsifying tests to ensure the reliability of electromagnetic relays, according to court papers. Government contracts accounted for about a third of Teledyne's $3.2 billion in sales last year. (AP, Apr 23/92)
Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California announced plans to blast an 11-pound projectile from a 155-foot-long cannon into a California hill. The test shot was intended to demonstrate that an ultra-high-velocity gun hitherto used only for laboratory research can be adapted to send payloads into space at only about one-fortieth of what it costs to orbit them by Space Shuttle. The gun was the product of a program called the Super High Altitude Research Project. (NY Times, Sept 29/92)
The new Space Shuttle Endeavour was slowly hauled to its seaside launching pad for work to ready the ship for an engine test firing in April and its maiden flight in early May. Mounted atop a powerful Apollo-era crawler-transporter, Endeavour began the 4 1/2 mile, six-hour trip to pad 39-B at 7:18 a.m. EST. Engineers spent the afternoon hooking up fuel lines and various mechanical, hydraulic and electrical systems. (UPI, Mar 14/92; AP, Mar 13/92; P Inq, Mar 14/92)
NASA announced that the first flight of the IML-O1 (International Microgravity Laboratory), was set for January 22, 1992, aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. Over 220 scientists from 14 countries were to be represented in this unprecedented international effort to conduct research in both materials and life sciences in the microgravity environment.

The Space Shuttle Endeavor roared into orbit on September 12 on a history-making seven-day mission. It carried the first married couple, Mark Lee and Jan Davis, the first black woman, Mae Jemison, and the first Japanese, Mamoru Mohri, to fly on a U.S. spacecraft. It also carried fish, frogs, hornets, flies, and fertilized chicken eggs, all subjects of the research mission. Endeavour's flight was also the first U.S. space mission devoted to Japanese research. Japan supplied 34 of the 43 Spacelab experiments, the United States seven, and two were shared. Japan contributed $90 million of the estimated $363 million cost of the flight.

The Space Shuttle Columbia and its crew set a record for the longest Space Shuttle flight on the 11th day of a laboratory research mission. Columbia passed the previous Shuttle endurance record of 10 days, 21 hours, and one minute set in 1990 by another Shuttle Columbia crew.

The scheduled launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was canceled because of fuel leaks, but NASA decided it was a fleeting problem that posed no danger. Launch director Bob Sieck said he was confident the trouble was not a recurrence of the hydrogen leaks that grounded the Shuttle fleet for almost six months in 1990. The launch was rescheduled for the next day. (W Post, Mar 24/92; NY Times, Mar 24/92; W Times, Mar 24/92; P Inq, Mar 24/92)
The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its annual report to officials of NASA, questioned the agency's decision to save money by eliminating several engine improvement programs, which could compromise the safety of future Space Shuttle flights. Although the panel said NASA was generally doing a good job on safety issues, the panel said it was unwise for the agency to stop developing a new main combustion chamber for the engine and a new hydrogen fuel pump.
