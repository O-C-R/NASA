Status of space shuttle technology was described by MSFC propulsion engineer Gerald M. Thompson during aiaa/sae Seventh Propulsion Joint Specialist Conference at Salt Lake City, Utah. Because “shuttle propulsion technology has been vigorously pursued in a totally organized approach for several years,” no major technology work remained to be done before shuttle main engine development phase began. Designs with strong technical bases were ready to proceed. However, if hydrogen propulsion was selected for air-breathing engines that would return shuttle stages to landing fields on mission completion, additional technology development would add about one year to schedule. Main engine development was to begin in 1971, with flight certification targeted for March 1978. (msfc Release 71-103)

Bartlett told state legislature in Oklahoma City there was good possibility that Oklahoma could become launch site for NASA space shuttle. “Based on the launch azimuth and the orbital inclinations . . . Oklahoma provides both a desirable launch and recovery location.” (Daily Oklahoman, 1/6/71, 1)
Senate, by vote of 82 to 5, passed H.R. 7109, $3.281-billion FY 1972 NASA authorization bill, after rejecting by vote of 64 to 22 Mondale amendment No. 233 that would have deleted from bill $138 million for space shuttle program.

Decisions on nasa’s space shuttle program might be politically timed, Aviation Week & Space Technology said. Four contractors would complete study contracts in spring 1972. “At this point, President Nixon— in the midst of his re-election campaign—might publicly state his support for the project.” Selection of winners “of the biggest plum in space” would not be announced until after the November election, magazine said. (Av Wk, 10/25/71, 11)
gao investigation of NASA selection of NR Rocketdyne Div. for prime contract for final design and manufacture of reusable space shuttle [see July 13] was requested by Bruce N. Torell, President of Pratt & Whitney Div. of United Aircraft Corp., in telegram to Elmer B. Staats, U.S. Comptroller General. Bases for protest were that source selection had disregarded objective of the rfp, nasa had failed to conduct “written or oral discussions” on proposals, Pratt & Whitney felt its proposal was “clearly entitled to a superior technical evaluation to the technical proposal of Rocketdyne,” and NASA had failed to give proper consideration to “Pratt & Whitney’s test-proven flight weight design and greater experience.” In letter to Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, nine senators requested that no award of space shuttle engine contract be made until gao investigation had been completed. (CR, 8/6/71, S13789)
Selection of NR Rocketdyne Div. for negotiations leading to award of 8500-million, cost-plus-award-fee contract for development and delivery of 35 space shuttle engines by 1978 was announced by nasa.

Program would be managed by msfc and would support space shuttle orbital flights beginning in 1978. (nasa Release 71-131)
Pratt & Whitney Div. of United Aircraft Corp. filed formal protest against nasa award of $500-million space shuttle main engine contract to NR Rocketdyne Div. and asked Federal Government to reverse award. In letter to Gao, Pratt & Whitney charged selection of Rocketdyne was “illegal, arbitrary and capricious, and based on unsound decisions” and reiterated complaints cited Aug. 3 to gao.

Results to date of study to determine minimum cockpit visibility required by space shuttle pilot to make safe horizontal ground landings were announced by FRC. Tests, begun in July with instrumented T—33 jet aircraft with radar system to judge accurate altitude to within two feet (0.6 meters), had shown pilots could land aircraft with greater visibility restrictions than expected. Visibility restriction of 5° had been extended to 75° on either side, or total of 150° in 225 approaches flown. Restrictions would be increased in future to 160°. (frc Release 26-71)
