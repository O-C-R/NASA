Ulysses, a European spacecraft deployed by U.S. Shuttle Discovery in October 1990, took three and a half years to travel the 93 million miles from Earth to the sun's south pole. Between June and the fall of 1995, when it was due to pass the sun's north pole, it would exhaustively examine the sun--the first time the sun had been observed from pole to pole. Ulysses was to examine the sun's magnetic field, which influenced the solar cycles as well as the climate on earth. The spacecraft also was to search for the source of gamma and gravity rays and to examine solar flares. (W Times, Jun 12/94)

NASA announced that the Ulysses spacecraft had become the first robotic exploration vehicle in history to reach a polar region of the sun when it passed over the sun's southern polar area June 26 after a journey of almost four years from Earth. The European Space Agency built Ulysses, and Space Shuttle Discovery deployed it in October 1990. In February 1992, Ulysses spent nearly 11 days exploring unknown regions of Jupiter before it gained enough momentum to loop into an orbit that passed over the poles of the sun. The sun has a global magnetic field and magnetic poles, but many details concerning the polar caps and magnetic fields, including the influence of incoming cosmic rays, remain unclear.

It was designed to fly 10 times before removal or replacement was required, compared with the single-flight ability of the current pump. (AvWk, Oct 17/94)
NASA spokesman George Diller said that as a result of an engine leak discovered in California, NASA had decided to check the welds on all engine nozzles of Shuttle Discovery. This fact, combined with the decision to replace one of Discovery's auxiliary power units, might result in a delay of the scheduled February 2, 1995 launch of Discovery. (O Sen Star, Dec 20/94)
