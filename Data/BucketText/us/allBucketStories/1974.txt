Economy moves left Kennedy Space Center dangerously short on fire protection, according to Jack N. Anderson and Les Whitten in a Washington Post article. The Center was being protected between 3:00 pm and 7:00 am by eight on-duty fire fighters, not enough to man the $750 000 worth of fire equipment or fight a conflagration, they said. The 3 237 500-sq-km facility contained 3747 cu m of liquid oxygen, 3028 cu m of liquid hydrogen, and rocket fuel “to stoke .a flash fire.” Boeing Co., which held the icsc fire protection contract, planned to lay off 21 firemen and shift others to lower paying jobs. A Boeing spokesman had said no manned missions were planned until 1975 and the base was adequately protected. The Post quoted a NASA spokesman as saying that the cuts were necessary and that additional fire fighting help was only five minutes away. (W Post, 11 Feb 74, B13)
President Nixon sent a $304.4-billion FY 1975 U.S. budget request to Congress, an increase of $29.8 billion over FY 1974- With 90% of the increase mandatory under existing law, the budget included few new programs and few cuts. Federal funds for research and development would increase by 9% from FY 1974, to $19.8 billion total obligations, “reflecting recognition of the larger potential contribution of science and technology to the solution of critical national problems.” A substantial increase- was requested for energy r&d, $2.05 billion in FY 1975 from $942 million in FY 1974. The FY 1975 r&d request proposed investment in priority national needs, but included basic research as well as efforts to speed the use of federally sponsored r&d. The non-Federal investment in r&d was expected to be $16 billion, 45% of a national total of $36 billion. nasa’s total budget request of $3,247 billion was $245 million above the FY 1974 appropriation and $96.2 million above the 1974 budget plan. If approved, the increase would be NASA’s first since 1965, except for a $100-million FY 1973 increase that the agency had not been permitted to spend. Significant budget items are shown in the table. The Dept, of Defense FY 1975 budget request of $85.8 billion included $9.3 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation, an increase NASA FY 1975 Budget Highlights (in thousands; items do not add to program totals because only selected items are listed) Budget Item FY 1974 FY 1975 FY 1975 Authorization Request Difference Total budget authority $3 054 500 $3 247 129 +$192 629 (3 002 100 appropriation) (+245 029) Research and development 2 245 500 (2 194 000 2 346 015 +100 515 appropriation) (+152 015) Manned space flight 1 032 000 1 124 800 +92 800 Space shuttle 475 000 800 000 +325 000 Space flight operations 555 500 323 300 -232 200 Skylab 233 800 — -233 800 ASTP 90 000 114 600 +24 600 Development, test & operations 220 200 175 200 -45 800 Space life sciences 21 000 18 000 -3 000 Space sciences 552 000 547 015 -4 985 Physics & astronomy 63 600 140 515 +76 915 OSO (un- 7 630 OAO dis- 2 380 heao (suspended 1974) trib- 40 400 Orbiting Explorers uted) 33 000 Large Space Telescope — 6 200 +6 200 Lunar & planetary 311 000 266 000 -45 000 Viking (un* 89 016 Mariner Jupiter-Saturn 1977 dis* 69 761 Pioneer Venus (new start 1975) trib- 27 100 Helios uted) 1 400 Lunar sample analysis 5 798 Lunar science operations 4 333 Launch vehicle procurement 177 400 140 500 -36 900 Space applications $161 000 $177 500 +$16 500 Weather and climate 51 100 35 000 -16 100 Nimbus 5 & F fun- 7 000 Tiros-N dis- 9 000 SMS-A & -B trib- 1 400 GABP uted) 7 400 Pollution monitoring 13 900 29 800 +15 900 Earth resources'survey 49 600 58 600 +9 000 EHTS-B (on dis- 11 100 Aircraft survey tributed) 17 300 Earth and ocean physics 10 700 18 500 +7 800 SEASAT-A — . 8 000 +8 000 Space processing 3 100 3 500 +400 Energy applications 2 000 2 000 — Communications satellites 22 100 8 300 -13 800 Heat Capacity Mapping Mission — 2 600 +2 600 Aeronautics & space technology 252 000 241 200 -10 800 Aeronautical 180 000 166 400 -13 600 Space & nuclear 72 000 74 800 +2 800 Tracking & data acquisition 244 000 250 000 +6 000 Technology utilization 4 500 5 500 +1 000 Construction of facilities 112 000 151 490 +39 490 (101 100 (+50 390) Infrared telescope facility, Hawaii — 6 040 +6 040 X-ray telescope facility, msfc — 4 060 +4 060 Space shuttle facilities 67 200 86 020 +18 820 Research & program management 707 000 749 624 +42 624 (707 000 (+42 624) DOD FY 1975 KDT&E Budget Highlights (in thousands; items do not add to program totals because only selected items are listed) Budget Item FY 1974 Budget Plan FY 1975 Budget Plan FY 1975 Difference Research, development, test, & evaluation £8 333 009 £9 322 469 +3989 460 Military astronautics 593 926 527 248 -66 678 Aircraft 1 682 381 1 829 318 +146 937 B-l advanced strategic bomber 449 000 499 000 +50 000 A-10 close-air-support aircraft 107 000 268 000 +161 000 AF air combat ighter — 36 000 -36 000 usn vfx fighter prototype — 34 000 -34 000 Tanker/missile-carrier aircraft — 20 000 -20 000 Advanced medium stol transport (amst) 25 000 56 000 -31 000 F-14 interceptor aircraft 737 000 756 000 -19 000 F—15 air superiority fighter 1 129 000 1 076 000 -53 000 Missiles 2 124 762 2,352 993 +228 231 Trident missile 528 000 649 000 +121 000 Air-launched cruise missile 11 000 80 000 +69 000 Submarine-launched cruise missile 3 000 45 000 +42 000 Advanced icbm technology 4 000 37 000 +33 000 Minuteman-site-defense prototype development 110 000 160 000 +50 000 Terminally guided maneuvering reentry vehicle (marv) — 20 000 +20 000 of $989.5 million from the FY 1974 budget plan.

The Dept, of Defense had officially approved development of the navstar Global Positioning System (gps), the Air Force announced. The first phase of the three-phase joint armed services program called for five Rockwell International Corp. spacecraft to join a Navy Navigational Technology Satellite (nts) in two-plane orbital constallations in 1977 to test the system. The five-meter, 635-kg spacecraft would be launched on Atlas F boosters by the Air Force Systems Command’s Space Missile Test Center. Phase two would bring the number of satellites to nine in three orbital planes. The operational third phase—with 24 satellites orbiting at an 18 520-km altitude, providing three-dimensional location to air, sea, and surface vehicles in all kinds of weather—would be complete in the mid-1980s, (afsc Release oip 274.74)

Schneider and the three Skylab crews had been selected as recipients of the 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy for “proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on earth,” the National Aeronautic Association announced. The Collier Committee—while recognizing contributions to the Skylab program by the more than 26000 engineers, scientists, flight controllers, and technicians—also had unanimously agreed that the trophy should be presented to Schneider on behalf of the crews for his leadership in this “exceedingly complex enterprise.” The trophy was presented by Vice President Gerald R. Ford in Washington, D.C., ceremonies 4 June. (naa News, April 74)
Roy E. Anderson, General Electric Co. Research and Development Center engineer, demonstrated the potential of geostationary satellites for search-and-rescue missions. Standing on the NASA Hq. steps in Washington, D.C., and using an ordinary walkie-talkie aided by an antenna built on the frame of a golfer’s umbrella, Anderson beamed a message to GE’s Radio-Optical Observatory in Schenectady, N.Y., via NASA’s Ats 3 Applications Technology Satellite. The inexpensive, 1.4-kg antenna increased the normal eight-kilometer range of the walkie-talkie more than 10 000 times. Anderson suggested that a global search-and-rescue system, covering all but the polar regions, would require only six geostationary satellites. The necessary transponder could be attached to any communications satellite and would draw only a small portion of the satellite’s power. (GE Release, 2 Oct 74; AP, B Sun, 3 Oct 74, A3)
Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue had experienced a harrowing last hour in space when they could not get commands to the secondary control system, which pointed the spacecraft heat shield at the correct angle during reentry. After discovering a leak in the prime reaction control system, the astronauts tried and failed to activate the secondary system. “Our hearts fell and our eyeballs popped,” Carr said at a 22 Feb. Johnson Space Center press conference. Carr, commander of the mission, instead had used a manual procedure to bypass the computer controlling the engine’s firing and guided the spacecraft to a safe on-target splashdown. The press later quoted a NASA spokesman as saying that the failure to activate the backup control system was “just a matter of a switch not being thrown.” (O’Toole, W Post, 15 Feb 74, Al; upi, Richmond Times-Dispatch, 16 Feb 74; Maloney, H Post, 23 Feb 74)

The press later identified the satellite as part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (dmsp). (Pres Rpt 74; SBD, 26 March 74, 138; Av Wk, 25 March 74,22)
Columbia Broadcasting System newsman Walter Cronkite recalled the two most exalting moments in his years of TV space coverage, during an interview with the Christian Science Monitor. The first was “Alan Shepard’s little 15-minute plop-down into the Atlantic. Rocketry itself was so uncertain ... I just didn’t know whether or not I was going to he able to watch.” The second was the first lunar landing. “That was a highly emotional moment for me. The actual touchdown, not so much Neil Armstrong’s walk.” Cronkite, preparing for the TV documentary “Space: A Report to the Stockholders,” said he still believed the major achievement of the moon landing was that “it proves that we truly have the capability at this stage of man’s civilization to do any dam thing we want—the most outlandish or the most practical things.” Of course there were important spinoff values. “Probably one of the most important industrial spinoffs ... is the command that U.S. industry had gotten in the computer business. ... I attribute that almost solely to the space program.” Cronkite said that recent cutbacks in the manned program were proper. “It is just about where it ought to be— most of the concentration now is in unmanned satellites” and a deliberate, but not crash, program toward the reusable space shuttle. If newsmen were allowed to travel on the space shuttle, he’d go “on any flight they offered me.” When asked if he wouldn’t he missed by American TV viewers at blastoff, he said, “What do you mean. . . ? I hope to he broadcasting all the time from inside!” (CSM, 19 July 74)
Kennedy Space Center had awarded a $382 000 contract to General Electric Co. for a multispectral-image-analysis system for data from the Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (in orhit since 23 July 1972), from Skylab’s earth resources experiment package (carried on the Orbital Workshop in 1973), and from remote-sensing aircraft, (ksc Release 80-74)
Analyses of light flashes seen by crew members of the last Apollo missions, tentatively attributed to cosmic ray nuclei penetrating the head and eyes, were reported by Univ. of Houston and Johnson Space Center scientists in Science magazine. Three kinds of flashes—the spot or star-like flash, the streak, and the cloud—had occurred randomly, with no apparent preference for one eye over the other. Astronauts saw many more flashes during translunar coast experiment sessions than in transearth coast, although the cosmic ray flux appeared to be the same inside the spacecraft during both coasts. No physiological explanation was found for this difference in frequency of flashes. (Pinsky, et al., Science, 8 March 74, 957-958)
The Navy had selected International Business Machines Corp. Electronic Systems Center as prime contractor for the light airborne multipurpose system (lamps) helicopter, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. Under a $13.8-million contract, IBM would develop and test a prototype antisubmarine warfare and avionics and weapon control system for installation and integration in a helicopter furnished by the Navy. (Av Wk, 8 April 74,24) 8 April-3 May: Some 75 Soviet aerospace specialists—including U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Technical Director Konstantin D. Bushuyev, prime crewmen Aleksey A. Leonov and Valery N. Kubasov, Flight Director Aleksey S. Yeliseyev, and training officer for astp crews Valery F. Bykovsky—joined U.S. astp astronauts and specialists at Johnson Space Center to continue technical discussions and planning for the July 1975 joint astp mission. Agreement was reached that specialists and flight crews would visit the U.S. launch site in February 1975 and the U.S.S.R. launch site in May 1975, for familiarization with the spacecraft and to test compatible equipment. NASA had defined no technical need for U.S. representatives at the Soviet launch site during actual liftoff; U.S. specialists would be in the control center. Apollo docking module and Soyuz life-support-system tests were reviewed, in addition to safety assessment reports on control systems and spacecraft manufacturing test and checkout. Schedules for each of the five joint experiments—ultraviolet absorption, biological interaction, microbial exchange, multipurpose furnace, and artificial solar eclipse— were approved. Agreement was also reached on the basic approach and content of the joint flight readiness review, to be held in May 1975. The U.S.S.R. crew and U.S. astp Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton walked through hundreds of procedures for the first time as crews, to verify the integrity of the docking module that would connect the Soyuz and Apollo command and service modules. At a 26 April press conference Stafford demonstrated his proficiency in the Russian language by answering newsmen’s questions in Russian. Cosmonauts and astronauts agreed that “we’ve no problem in language.” One cosmonaut said, “Our work is considerably better when the American crew speaks Russian and our crew speaks English.” Glynn S. Lunney, astp Technical Director for the U.S., said during a 3 May press briefing that the work in the U.S. and jointly was on schedule. The progress “has been good and . . . gratifying.” Prof. Bushuyev said that “there can be no longer any doubt that we will be successful in preparing for and achieving our joint flight in July 1975.” (jsc Roundup, 12 April 74, 1; astp Communique; Press briefing transcripts, 26 April 74, 3 May 74)
Dr. George A. Van Biesbroeck, Univ. of Arizona astronomer noted for his work with twin stars, asteroids, and comets, died in Arizona at the age of 94. Dr. Van Biesbroeck had charted the orbit of Neptune’s second satellite, published catalogs of double stars, and discovered 11 asteroids and 2 comets. In the 1930s he had been instrumental in establishing the McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Tex. Dr. Van Biesbroeck had won the Franklin L. Burr Award from the National Geographic Society in 1952 for finding new proof of the bending of light from stars in support of the Einstein theory of relativity. (AP, NYT, 26 Feb 74, 36) 24 February-1 March: This would be the age we could contact other civilizations, Dr. Frank D. Drake, Cornell Univ. astronomer, told the annual meeting of the American Assn, for the Advancement of Science in San Francisco. The problem was finding ways to detect them. Analysis of data from a 1973 search of 500 stars by Univ. of Maryland and Univ. of Chicago scientists had failed to reveal radio emissions suggestive of other technological civilizations. Possibly “no one is seeking to make radio transmissions” and eavesdropping would be the only method of detection. Project Cyclops, a NASA-supported study proposing construction of a 16-km-wide field of 1400, 91-m antennas, would have a high probability of success if civilization existed within 200 light years. The ultimate $5-billion cost would be less than the Apollo moon landings and would give man a chance to contact the “galactic community.” {NYT, 14 March 74, 15; Salisbury, CSM, 7 March 74) _
President Nixon wired salutations to Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue aboard the recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans after their successful splashdown at 11:17 am edt. The astronauts, launched 16 Nov. 1973, had set an 84-day space flight record in the Orbital Workshop. The President said: “On behalf of the American people, I salute Skylab’s third crew of astronauts on their safe return to earth. They have successfully completed man’s longest space journey and brought to an end one of the most scientifically productive endeavors in the history of human exploration. From the Skylab program, we have learned that we can live and work in space for long periods of time. And we have found that the results of these efforts can be of enormous practical value to life on earth. “Skylab now joins the ranks of the Santa Maria, the H.M.S. Beagle, the Spirit of St. Louis, and the Eagle. Each of these great vehicles has carried us beyond the contemporary limits of human knowledge into a new comprehension of our own possibilities and a new definition of our own destiny. We welcome the men of Skylab home, and we salute them and all their predecessors who have launched us on this great adventure.” {PD, 11 Feb 74,193; A&A 1973) .
American Broadcasting Co. Science Editor Jules Bergman recalled tales of astronauts in a TV Guide article and noted that, with the splashdown of Skylab 4, an incredible era of space flight had come to an end. In 30 manned flights the U.S. had moved from the first 15-min sub-oibital flight to 12 Americans walking on the moon and then finally to the near-routine Skylab endurance missions. It would be a long while before someone set out for the planets, a trip which would require far more advanced propulsion systems than now available. But “we will go to the planets. . . . We will go beyond Jupiter. We will go beyond this solar system and eventually build starcraft to go so far that man’s only limit will be his imagination and ingenuity. But the mission clearly for the next decade is this Earth: it is the only home man has at the moment.” (TV Guide, 2 March 74)
Jet aircraft pollution would be measured under a $1.1-million NASA contract awarded to United Air Lines, Inc., NASA announced. Under the cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, United would design, develop, test, and fly a Boeing 747—equipped to measure dust particles and gases—to determine the effects of jet exhaust on the natural environment, weather, and human health and to measure changes in the level of the ozone shielding people on the earth from solar ultraviolet radiation. Flights would be made over the continental U.S. and Hawaii in addition to international ' flights by another 747 under a subcontract with Pan American World Airways, Inc. The instruments were expected to be installed by the end of 1975. NASA would work closely with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to correlate study results, (nasa Release 74-20)
The Air Force launched Nts 1 Navigation Technology Satellite on an Atlas F booster from Vandenberg Air Force Base into orbit with a 13 762-km apogee, 13 440-km perigee, 7-hr 48-min period, and 125.1° inclination. The spacecraft, designed and built by the Naval Research Laboratory and originally called Timation 3A, would test techniques under consideration for the Dept, of Defense’s navstar Global Positioning System (gps) . Nts 1 carried receivers and transmitters to broadcast its exact position continuously and an atomic clock to transmit ultraprecise time signals, navstar, when completed in the mid-1980s, would be a system of 24 satellites providing worldwide, accurate, and instantaneous three-dimensional positions of air, sea, and surface vehicles equipped with a gps receiver.

The space shuttle would introduce a new mode oi space research in the 1980s, Dr. John E. Naugle, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator, said at a space transportation system press briefing in Washington, D.C. Sounding rockets gave the scientist an immediate return of data but only for a very short-duration flight. Satellites provided longer mission times but it might be five to seven years from the initiation of the project until data were received. Experiments flown on the shuttle could remain in orbit from 7 to 30 days and then be returned immediately for evaluation. This capability would be a powerful tool in the development of new technology. Dr. Myron S. Malkin, Space Shuttle Program Director, said NASA’s commitment to Congress called for a total development cost of $5.15 billion in 1971 dollars for two operational shuttle vehicles plus $10.5 million for each of 725 missions projected for 1980-1990. Mission costs would be shared by participating experimenters, and estimates were now running at $9.05 million per flight because of reduced estimates for external tank development. Cost for a shuttle flight, which could take 29 500 kg into orbit, contrasted with $18 million for a 4500-kg payload launched on an expendable Atlas booster and up to $58 million to orbit 14 000-18 000 kg on a Saturn IB. Shuttle development was on schedule; the first approach and landing tests were to be in the second quarter of 1977 and the first manned orbital flight in 1979. Orbiter manufacture was under way. The main engine oxygen burner had been tested 14 April and the first big engine firing was scheduled for the end of 1975. NASA would need a fleet of seven orbi-ters at $250 million each if the projected missions were flown. Elwood W. Land, Jr., of the Space Shuttle Systems Office said a 25-astronaut flight corps probably would be maintained to fly missions averaging more than one a week. LeRoy E. Day, Space Shuttle Program Deputy Director, reported the main engine was being designed to make 55 starts before refurbishment was necessary. Engine lifetime would be much longer. The solid boosters were being designed for 20 flights. Phillip E. Culbertson, Director of Mission and Payload Integration, said that all but the smallest expendable launch vehicles would be phased out about three years after the shuttle became operational.

A New York Times editorial noted that the 8 Feb. safe return of the Skylab 4 astronauts “was considered so certain that the television networks had decided well in advance not to broadcast the splashdown.” It “really was a public tribute to the high technical achievements of the Skylab program and of previous manned American space projects.” With Skylab’s record and dividends, “the case for a permanent manned station in space can now be regarded as proved.” (NYT, 10 Feb 74)
The North American Air Defense Command’s count of objects in orbit around the earth totaled 624 payloads and 2349 pieces of debris, left from 7038 objects placed in space by man since the beginning of the space age in 1957. Space debris was falling back into the atmosphere at a rate of one piece a day, but norad’s tracking and impact prediction pro-gram analyzed the decay trajectory of each satellite that might survive reentry and predicted the time and area of impact, issuing warnings if any were deemed hazardous. Most returning objects were burned up by friction heat on reentry and most of the rest fell into oceans and seas. To date, the only fatality caused by space debris was a cow killed nearly 13 yrs ago when an 88-kg chunk of metal from a U.S. space probe struck the earth near a Cuban village. Eventually, however, increasing space debris and reentries might require traffic control assistance for supersonic aircraft and spacecraft. “Short of sending up some sort of a celestial vacuum cleaner . . . the best approach . . . appears to be tracking and impact prediction,” NORAD spokesmen said.

The International Aeronautical Federation held its 25th Congress in Amsterdam with the theme “Space Stations, Present and Future.” Among speakers, Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford and Cosmonaut Aleksey A. Leonov, U.S. and Soviet commanders in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, stressed how well joint work and understanding had advanced. A paper by Daniel J. Shramo of Lewis Research Center, with B. R. Foushee and P. J. O’Leary of General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., described the Centaur primary upper stage for solar system exploration and its potential adaptation as an upper stage for the space shuttle. A Ukranian Academy of Sciences research team reported on experiments in the formation of melts in weightlessness with radiant heating and on prospects of using solar energy for space engineering. Comparative studies of metal solidification had suggested that a more uniform distribution of short-grained structures under weightlessness might become the basis of space technology, with the added attraction of using the sun as an energy source. The team had built a prototype solar plant that could be mounted on a spacecraft or used in a vacuum chamber on the earth. Soviet medical investigations during the flights of Soyuz 12 (launched 27 Sept. 1973), Soyuz 13 (18 Dec. 1973), and Soyuz 14 (3 July) were reported by Dr. Oleg G. Gazenko and others. Findings indicated that prolonged exercises, full and partial spacesuits, and gravity-simulating fittings had reduced effects of weightlessness during the space flight and after the crew’s return. Although reports of initial adaptation symptoms were similar to American findings, the Soviet paper also noted that cosmonauts had reduced vestibular symptoms by deliberately slowing down movements, especially head movements. Prof. Hilding A. Bjurstedt, Head of the Dept, of Aviation Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, received the 1974 Daniel and Florence Guggenheim International Astronautics Award of the International Academy of Astronautics for studies of physiological responses to environmental stress. Leonard Jaffe, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications, was elected iaf President (iaa Ann Rpt, 28 Aug 74; Parks, SF, Feb 75, 42-50; Program, 25th iaf Congress; NASA Activities, 15 Dec 74, 21) During September: Large-scale verification tests of the “rectenna” receiving system for microwave energy transmission were run at Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA. A microwave energy transmission system was being developed to determine the possibility of transmitting energy through space. The tests established a new record for microwave power transmission, delivering one kilowatt over a 1.6-km range. The 10-yr program had increased DC-to-DC efficiency of transmissions from 17% to 50% and efficiency of the rectenna in converting radio frequency to dc from 25% to 78%.

President Ford signed into law the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (P.L. 93^138), abolishing the Atomic Energy Commission and establishing in its place three new Federal entities: the Energy Research and Development Administration, the Energy Resources Council, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The President also signed Executive Order 11841, activating the Energy Resources Council and appointing the Secretary of the Interior its Chairman. P.L. 93—438 was to become effective not later than 120 days after signature. {PD, 14 Oct 74,1271-3; CR, 8 Oct 74, H10134) Ariel 5—a 132-kg, solar-powered, 16-sided polygon designed by the U.K.—was the fifth satellite launched in a cooperative program between NASA and the U.K. Science Research Council. The mission of its one-year operating life was to study x-ray sources both within and beyond our galaxy, using five experiments from U.K. and one from Goddard Space Flight Center. Instruments were designed to follow up findings of UhuTu (Explorer 42), launched 12 Dec. 1970, and Oao 3, launched 21 Aug. 1971. Uhuru had extended the number of known celestial x-ray sources from about 30 to 200 and found evidence of a black hole companion to Cygnus X-l, later supported by Oao 3, sounding rocket, and ground-based observations. Four Ariel 5 pointing experiments focused on specific x-ray sources, and two scanning experiments swept the entire galaxy with every revolution. The GSFC scanning experiment—first of its kind to fly on an orbiting scientific satellite—consisted of two x-ray pinhole cameras, each with a 90° field of view, providing together a sweep of the entire sky. After evaluation, Ariel 5 results would be available to the world scientific community. Though all experiments obtained data during initial tests, two were drawing excessive current. The problem was resolved by outgassing. A slight delay in shutter closing on Experiment A, a star sensor, had little or no effect on the mission. The U.K.-U.S. cooperative satellite series had begun with Ariel 1 in 1962 and continued through Ariel 4, launched 11 Dec. 1971. Ariel 5 was launched under a 2 Nov. 1970 src-nasa Memorandum of Understanding, with a 27 Dec. 1973 letter modification shifting the launch site from Wallops Flight Center to San Marco to enhance scientific data return. The Memorandum tasked src with spacecraft design, fabrication, and testing, five experiments, primary command and control, and data reduction and analysis, nasa was responsible for one experiment, spacecraft technical support, the Scout launch vehicle, and tracking, command, and data acquisition, src financed all aspects of the Ariel program. The launch by members of the Univ. of Rome’s Aerospace Research Center was the seventh from San Marco, but the first payload for a country other than the U.S. or Italy (nasa mors, 11 Oct 6, Nov 74; nasa Release 74-274)
NASA officials testified on the proposal to lease a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and on the closing of Plum Brook Station, during FY 1975 authorization hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology. Associate Deputy Administrator Willis H. Shapley said NASA recommended lease instead of Government ownership and operation for four reasons. First, contracting for services would be as cost-effective as a conventional network of ground stations. Second, expenditures would be deferred to years when resulting savings could be realized. Funding required to procure a NASA-owned TDRSS would reduce the resources that could be applied to important mainline programs. Third, industrial technology was ready to provide the needed services. Fourth, the proposed arrangement was consistent with long-standing policies and practice of the Government to rely on industry for communications services. Acting Associate Administrator Edwin C. Kilgore of NASA’s Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology testified that Lewis Research Center’s Plum Brook Station, which was to be closed by June 1974 because of FY 1974 Civil Service work force cuts, would keep its Space Power Facility on standby. The Air Force, Navy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Atomic Energy Commission, and other agencies were considering using the facility—the world’s largest space environment facility, which included a unique solar simulation system. Also, NASA’s cooperative program with the National Science Foundation to study wind-driven energy devices was based at Plum Brook. LeRC Director Bruce T. Lundin reported that reduction-in-force notices had been sent to 177 Civil Service employees 11 March, following 180 in the past year, out of LeRc’s 400 separations. Dr. Kilgore said 50 engineers and technicians would be retained for the Space Power Facility at Plum Brook, which once employed 600 workers. (Transcript)
The satellite relay system planned for the July 1975 Apollo-Soyuz space mission was tested by Johnson Space Center and Goddard Space Flight Center communications engineers. Ats 6 Applications Technology Satellite (launched 30 May) and the Apollo S-band, steerable, high-gain antenna were tested together for the transmission of voice, television, and simulated telemettry data in preparation for the first spacecraft-to-satellite-to-ground routing employed in the manned space flight program. Signals were transmitted between JSC and the ground station in Rosman, N.C., via the Ats 6 in a simulation of mission conditions, (jsc Release 74-264; jsc Roundup, 8 Nov 74)
A multibillion dollar competition between the U.S. and France was being waged over which country would produce the new generation of fighter aircraft for the Western European allies, the New York Times reported. To the victor would go one of the largest aircraft export sales in history, the possibility of producing 2006 or more aircraft worth between $10 billion and $15 billion. To replace their 10-yr-old, U.S.-built F-104 Star-fighter, the Europeans would like a low-cost, high-performance fighter that could meet military requirements through the 1990s. The U.S. was offering versions of the lightweight fighter—the General Dynamics Corp. YF-16 and the Northrop Corp. YF-17, now in competition for an Air Force production contract [see 9 June]—while the French were offering an improved version of the F—1 Mirage. Pentagon officials claimed both the YF-16 and YF—17 were superior to the Mirage in acceleration and maneuverability despite the more powerful engine in the French aircraft. The competition would probably be decided as much on economic and political grounds as by military considerations. The French argued that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies should “buy European” and maintain European solidarity. The U.S. emphasized standardization of weapons within NATO and the future willingness of the U.S. to maintain forces in Western Europe. Although the immediate potential customers—Belgium, The Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark—would need about 300 aircraft, American officials were envisaging even larger markets in other West European countries and the world market.

The Air Force Air Weather Service began operational testing of the Airborne Weather Reconnaissance System (awrs) aircraft over the Gulf and East Coasts. The modified WC-130 aircraft—using the most advanced meteorological and atmospheric sensors to provide continuous accurate measurements of wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, and dewpoint-humidity at flight levels—would study the structure and internal forces of hurricanes, storms, and other atmospheric phenomena. The aircraft also carried the first airborne, integrated Omega-inertial navigation system for positional accuracies of about 2 km on a 6000-km overwater mission, (afsc Release oip 116.74)
The Air Force Systems Command announced that it would launch an S3-1 satellite late in 1974 as part of a three-launch series to measure atmospheric effects on satellites. The first satellite would be placed in polar orbit with a 4000-km apogee and a 140-km perigee. It would be equipped with ionization gauges and accelerometers to measure air density and to provide data on space vehicle trajectory, slowdown, and decay. Other devices would measure atmospheric heating sources, solar radiation, and atmospheric parameters. With a mass spectrometer in addition, to gather neutral and ion composition data, the experiments would help researchers understand physical and chemical processes in interactions of the sun’s radiation with the upper atmosphere, as well as neutral atmospheric effects on the ionosphere. The low-altitude measurements would be used to predict the occurrence and duration of radio blackouts and of atmospheric effects on orbits, (afsc Release oip 137.74)
Photographs from the Skylab missions, Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite, and a NASA U—2 aircraft had helped end a legal confrontation between land developers and the State of Florida, Kennedy Space Center reported. Proposed heavy development of a section of the Green Swamp had threatened to endanger a subsurface rock formation, the Florida Acquifer, which provided 90% of the state’s water. In conflict were the rights of owners to develop their property and the public’ 's right to protect vital water resources. The NASA photos demonstrated the effects of land development and led to a settlement beneficial to both parties, permitting development in large tracts with carefully planned drainage and without chemical control of aquatic weeds, (ksc Release 90-74)
Dr. Malcolm R. Currie, Dept, of Defense Director of Defense Research and Engineering, testified on dod space programs before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1975 NASA authorization hearings: dod would provide an interim, upper, orbit-to-orbit stage (oos) for initial use with NASA’s space shuttle until NASA could develop a permanent space tug. The oos, which would provide the high orbits necessary for about 60% of military payloads, would be a low-cost modification of an existing upper stage and would be phased to coincide with the first operation of the shuttle orbiter in 1980. About $3.0 million would he spent in FY 1975 to select stage configuration and initiate detailed specifications. The oos would have no payload retrieval capability and might not be reusable but could be used by NASA or any other shuttle user during early shuttle operations, dod would install facilities to provide initial shuttle capability at Vandenberg Air Force Base in December 1982. Shuttle hardware, software, operating procedures, and ground equipment would be common and interchangeable to the maximum extent possible between KSC and Vandenberg. During FY 1974 DOD had initiated the development and validation plan for the navstar Global Positioning System, using satellites to provide worldwide precise positioning and navigation, accurate to tens of meters. The system, usable for civilian purposes as well as military, would halt the proliferation of specialized systems. The Navy’s Fleet Satellite Communications System (fltsatcom) , to provide reliable beyond-the-horizon communications for command and control of mobile DOD forces, was “well into development.” Terminal equipment for the fleet would be installed in FY 1975 and FY 1976 and would be operated through minimal leased transponders in Communication Satellite Corp.’s Maritime Communications Satellite System pending full operation of fltsatcom in 1976. Three operational early warning satellites were in geostationary orbit. DOD would seek to improve coverage and mission duration and continue development of a simplified processing station. Two Lincoln Experimental Satellites, comsats les 8 and 9 scheduled for 1975 launch, would use radioisotope thermoelectric generators instead of solar cell arrays. The Space Detection and Tracking System (spadats), which could cover up to 5600 km, would he expanded. DOD was working on detectors, target discrimination, data processing, and other critical optical and radar components, to reach a near-real-time ground-based capability by FY 1978 to detect, track, and identify all objects up to 36 000-km altitude.

NASA FY 1975 authorization bill H.R. 13998, a clean bill introduced 4 April to replace H.R. 12689, was reported out of the House Committee oh Science and Astronautics. The revised bill would authorize $3,253 billion in FY 1975 funding, an increase of $6 million over the original request. Authorizations for research and development increased $11 million to $2,357 billion, and construction of facilities decreased $5 million, to $146.5 million. Funding for research and program management remained the same. Iiicluded in the k&d increases was a $2Q-million addition, to a total $112.3 million, for the space shuttle main engine, which had encountered technical problems during early development. The increase was proposed to add confidence in meeting schedules and hold total program costs at the current projection. A $4.3-million increase, to $170.7 million, was added for aeronautical research and technology. A $1.8-million increase brought the total for space and nuclear research and technology to $76.6 million. Manned space flight operations funding was decreased $15 million, to $308.3 million, including a $5-million decrease (to $109.6 million) for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project and a $10-million decrease (to $165.2 million) in development, test, and mission operations. Changes in facility construction authorizations included an increase of $4 million, to $10.04 million for construction of the infrared telescope facility in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The Committee also requested that NASA make a scientific and technological inventory of its capability to contribute to such critical national needs as energy, transportation, and environmental control. NASA was to report to the Committee by 1 Aug. (H Rpt 93-983)
The success of the Skylab program had made the idea of continuous occupation of an orbital base more concrete to the directors of the American space efforts, a New York Times article reported. Such a base could be assembled by flights of the space shuttle being developed by NASA and could be used to observe the sun and the earth and for manufacturing special materials under weightless conditions. Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider had said in an interview, “We have shown that there is no man or machine limitation on whatever we want to do in space.” The confidence of space scientists had been strengthened by the apparent adaptation of the astronauts to space, although the Times reported Skylab 2 Astronaut Joseph P. Kerwin and Johnson Space Center Director Christopher C. Kraft as cautioning that nine men “is a very small statistical sample.” More long test flights would have to be made. However, if the medical data held true, the design of future space stations could be made much simpler and the number of space shuttle flights to establish it would be fewer. Schneider had noted that the conflict between the Workshop’s need for power and its program for observation was still to be solved. The current design called for Workshop solar panels to point toward the sun rather than the earth. In a future space station, observatories might be placed on long booms which could turn on their own, minimizing the station’s need to maneuver. (McElheny, NYT, 10 Feb 74,40)

“No other person who has flown in space has captured the experience so vividly,” Henry S. F. Cooper said in a review of Carrying the Fire: An Astronaut’s Journeys by Apollo 11 Astronaut Michael Collins. Although the book was “long and rambling,” touching a great many bases in Collins’ career from Air Force test pilot through Gemini 10 and Apollo, “it is something new under the sun to find an astronaut who isn’t afraid to express his feelings.” Collins was best at single impressions, . “little snapshots,” still sharp and clear five years after the lunar landing. Two days out on the mission, “ ‘The moon I have known all my life, that two-dimensional, small yellow disk in the sky, has gone somewhere to be replaced by the most awesome sphere I have ever seen. . . . This cool, magnificent sphere hangs there ominously, a formidable presence without sound or motion, issuing us no invitation to invade its domain.’ ” Collins had cast off the “diffidence astronauts normally wear like spacesuits to protect themselves from prying earthlings. ... ‘I have been places and done things you simply would not believe. I have dangled from a cord a hundred miles up; I have seen the earth eclipsed by the moon, and enjoyed it. I have seen the sun’s true light, unfiltered by any planet’s atmosphere. I have seen the ultimate black of infinity in a stillness undisturbed by any living thing. ...

Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, signed a NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences agreement on news coverage of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight, scheduled for July 1975. The agreement brought a protest from Associated Press President and General Manager J. Wes Gallagher because it excluded American newsmen from the Soviet launching. In a 23 Oct. letter to Gallagher, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, stated that, while the Soviets were adamant on this question, they had otherwise agreed to provide “the most complete, Comprehensive release ever to the U.S. news media of real-time information related to a Soviet space mission.” The agreement, Dr. Fletcher noted, covered joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. activities while recognizing the right of each nation to establish policies for their respective independent activities. The U.S. would not exclude Soviet newsmen from the U.S. liftoff. The Public Affairs Agreement provided that, beginning with the Soyuz launch and ending with the Apollo recovery, onboard information from both spacecraft, voice communications between the spacecraft, and ground communications with both spacecraft, as well as ground-based and onboard TV, would be exchanged immediately. The first real-time TV coverage of a Soviet launch would be released to the West. Factual information on joint activities would be released immediately. Lines from the U.S. public affairs center in Moscow would communicate with technical specialists in the Soviet mission control center.

The booster ejected the transtage and spacecraft into an elliptical parking orbit with a 626-km apogee and 152-km perigee. At the second equatorial crossing the first bum of the transtage placed the spacecraft in a transfer orbit. Launch, parking orbit, and transfer orbit were close to the program plan. At 3:29 pm EDT, Ats 6 was injected into geosynchronous orbit with a 35 845.6-km apogee, 35 774.1-km perigee, 23-hr 57-min period, and 1.8° inclination. The near-perfect orbit eliminated need for corrections, leaving nine kilograms of fuel for operational contingencies. The spacecraft separated from the transtage at 3:33 pm EDT. An orbital correction 7 June changed the 0.27°-per-day westward drift to a 0.05° eastward drift. Checkout of spacecraft systems and onboard experiments was completed 28 June with no significant anomalies. The mission was adjudged a success 26 Sept Primary objectives of the mission were to inject the spacecraft into near-geostationary orbit, erect and evaluate a nine-meter antenna to provide a good-quality signal to small inexpensive ground receivers, stabilize the spacecraft using a three-axis control system, and support user-oriented applications experiments. Secondary objectives were to demonstrate new technology in aircraft and maritime traffic control and infrared earth observations; acquire system data for communications applications in space, including spacecraft-to-spacecraft relay; test spacecraft control; and measure particles and radiation. The 20 experiments included a health-education telecommunications experiment to broadcast programs in several languages simultaneously to citizens in remote areas of the country. The satellite also would aid in remote medical telediagnosis and teleconsultation, transmitting patients’ medical records to faraway hospital centers for emergency assistance. One year after launch Ats 6 would be moved over Lake Victoria in Central Africa. India would then use the satellite to broadcast programs teaching agricultural techniques, family planning and hygjene, school courses and teacher education, and occupational skills to 5000 villages. The $600 ground receiving terminals each consisted of a receiver, converter, and three-meter chicken-wire antenna. Ats 6 was the sixth in a series of ATS satellites developed to advance technology in design, propulsion, and stabilization systems; meteorological concepts; applications; space environmental studies and measurement systems; and communications. Ats 1 (launched 6 Dec. 1966), Ats 3 (5 Nov. 1967), and Ats 5 (12 Aug. 1969) were still transmitting useful data. The ATS program was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under the direction of the Office of Applications.

NASA and the Federal Government as a whole were charged with race and sex discrimination in a class action suit filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (naacp) Legal Defense Fund in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The suit was initiated by two employees at Johnson Space Center. The naacp Legal Defense Fund labeled as “lame excuses” NASA’s claims that work forces were dropping throughout the agency and that it was difficult to find qualified blacks and women in its specialized areas of work. (AP, NYT, 21 Nov 74; Robinson, W Post, 21 Nov 74) 21 November-20 December: NASA launched Intelsat-IV F-8 for the Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization. The 1387-kg satellite was launched from Eastern Test Range at 6:44 pm est on an Atlas-Centaur vehicle into a transfer orbit with a 35 899.2-km apogee, 536.5-km perigee, 10-hr 39.8-min period, and 26.0° inclination. NASA’s primary objectives were to conduct design, performance, and flight readiness reviews for the Federal Communications Commission, to ensure compatibility of Intelsat spacecraft with NASA launch vehicles and launch environmental conditions, and to launch Intelsat-IV F-8 into a transfer orbit that would permit the spacecraft apogee motor to inject the spacecraft into a synchronous orbit for communications service. The apogee kick motor was fired by ComSatCorp at 6:48 pm est on 23 Nov., placing Intelsat-IV F-8 in a near-circular .orbit with a 35 780-km apogee, 35 630-km perigee, 23-hr 51.9-min period, and 1.8° inclination. The spacecraft then drifted to its station at 174° E longitude over the Pacific Ocean, arriving 12 Dec. NASA adjudged the mission a success 20 Dec. Intelsat-IV F-8 joined five operational Intelsat IV commercial com-sats: three over the Atlantic—F—2 launched 25 Jan 1971, F—3 launched 19 Dec. 1971, and F—7 launched 23 Aug. 1973; one over the Pacific— F—4 launched 22 Jan. 1972; and one over the Indian Ocean—F—5 launched 13 June 1972. F-8 replaced F-4, which became a spare, orbiting over 178° E longitude. F-8 was designed to operate seven years and could provide multiple access and simultaneous transmission. It had a capacity for 3000 circuits with transponders in earth mode and 9000 circuits with transponders in spot-beam-coverage mode, or 12 TV channels, or certain combinations, (nasa mors, 22 Nov, 24 Dec 74; GSFC Wkly SSR, 21-26 Nov 74; nasa Release 74-305; intelsat Releases 74-62,74-70; nasa Atlas-Centaur Mgr, interview, 30 July 75)
Pan American World Airways, Inc., and Trans World Airlines, Inc., each petitioned the Civil Aeronautics Board for subsidies. Pan Am sought a $195-million-a-year mail subsidy because of a pending financial crisis following six years of losses, including an expected net loss of $65 million in 1974. In addition to a huge debt, Pan Am had been hit by foreign competition, sharp drops in traffic, overcapacity (half-empty Boeing 747 transports), and soaring costs, including a $200-million annual increase in fuel costs, twa asked a temporary subsidy to offset fuel costs, estimating 1974 international losses would be $47 million— in contrast to a 1973 profit of $19.5 million. On 2 April the Dept, of Justice and Dept, of Transportation had discouraged Pan Am and TWA discussions of pooling transatlantic operations as an economy measure, telling CAB that discussions were premature.

Johnson Space Center and the Mexican National Commission for Outer Space had begun a remote-sensing test project to assist in eradicating the screwworm from Mexico, NASA announced. The experimental phase vas under way and was expected to continue for a year. Sensor data provided by Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched 23 July 1972) and orbiting meteorological satellites including Noaa 2 and 3 (launched 15 Oct. 1972 and 6 Nov. 1973) would be combined with data from a Mexican remote-sensing aircraft on soil temperature, moisture, and vegetation—all of which affected breeding patterns of the screwworm fly. Sterile flies could then be distributed to potential breeding grounds of the fly, which frequently caused $200 million annual losses to cattle, poultry, and wildlife. (NASA Release 74-60)

Academy of Sciences counterparts in Moscow as joint preparations for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project’s July 1975 flight continued. On 8 Sept, another group of 47 specialists and engineers headed by U.S. astp Technical Director Glynn S. Lunney arrived in Moscow for 2 weeks of meetings with the Soviet group headed by U.S.S.R. Technical Director Konstantin D. Bushuyev. The project directors announced plans for joint prelaunch tests at the U.S. launch site 1-8 Feb. 1975 and at the U.S.S.R. launch area 5-13 May 1975. Flight crews and technical specialists from both countries would participate. Soviet specialists also announced plans to fly a manned Soyuz mission to test ASTP-related systems. NASA would be informed of further details before the flight to permit tracking. Thirteen U.S. flight controllers were also spending two Weeks in Moscow beginning 15 Sept., meeting with Soviet controllers for familiarization and training, including briefings on Soviet Mission Control Center operations, Soyuz spacecraft systems, and the mission flight plan, (jsc astp Press Communique, 20 Sept 74; jsc Roundup, 13 Sept 74; jsc Release 74-250) year in space. Dr. G. D. Whedon of the National Institutes of Health stated that weightlessness could threaten capable musculo-skeletal functions during space flights lasting up to three years unless measures could be developed to prevent significant losses of calcium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Continued loss of calcium could cause astronauts to break their backs or legs and could promote formation of kidney stones. Dr. William E. Thornton, life scientist in the jsc Astronaut Office, reported that by Mission Day 3 all Skylab crewmen had lost more than 2000 cc (2 qts) of extravascular fluid from calf and thigh; at recovery, a sharp reversal was noted. The Thornton team suggested that the reason for the shift was the intrinsic and unopposed lower limb elasticity, which forced venous blood and other fluids toward the head. Other investigators reported that such cardiovascular changes as the heart’s decreased ventricular size and the suppression of red blood cell production was the body’s accommodation to weightlessness. These physiological changes had been the expected response to a lack of exertion; they reversed after the astronauts’ return to earth, (jsc Roundup, 30 Aug 74,1-2; JSC proj off, interview, 12 Aug 75; Altman, NYT, 1 Sept 74,14)

Federal support to universities and colleges had declined 7%, to $3823 million, during FY 1973 in the first decline since 1970, the National Science Foundation reported. The drop had been largely the result of a $267-million decrease in funds from the Dept, of Health, Education, and Welfare but other significant decreases were posted by nsf, down $40 million; Dept, of Defense, down $11 million; and NASA, down $8 million. Federal funds for academic science activities totaled $2463 million, 5% below 1972. Two science fields had shown an increase in Federal r&d support between 1972 and 1973'. Life sciences’ $934 million was a 4% increase; engineering’s $204 million was up 6%.

Russell W. McFall, Chairman of the Board and President of Western Union Corp. transmitted the first message, from New York to Los Angeles, using the original Morse key to tap “What hath God wrought!” It was the same message sent by inventor Samuel F. B. Morse 24 May 1844 over the first experimental telegraph, a 65-km line between the Capitol in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Md. Regular commercial operations began 16 July, providing services for Westar J’s first two commercial customers, American Can Co. and Bank of America. (Westar Inaugural Transmission press kit, 15 July 74) 16— 29 July: NASA launched Aeros 2 (Aeros-B) aeronomy satellite for West Germany from Western Test Range at 4:51 am pdt on a four-stage Scout launch vehicle into polar orbit with an 879.0-km apogee, 221.3km perigee, 95.65-min period, and 97.44° inclination. The NASA mission objective—to place the Aeros 2 satellite in an earth orbit permitting successful achievement of the scientific objectives—was met and the mission was adjudged successful 26 July. The scientific objective was to measure the main aeronomic parameters of the upper atmosphere and the solar ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength band of the main absorption. The long-range objective of the satellite, which carried one Goddard Space Flight Center and four West German experiments, was to provide a model of the ionosphere from which upper atmospheric conditions could be predicted. By 29 July the vehicle and experiments were performing satisfactorily and the West Germans were initiating spacecraft operations. A July 1965 agreement between the U.S. and West Germany had provided for a series of cooperative satellite projects. The Aeros program, the second in the series, was authorized by a 10 June 1969 agreement and Aeros 1 was launched 16 Dec. 1972. The 1974 contract between NASA and the West Germany Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (bmft) for the Aeros 2 launch provided for reimbursement of NASA for launch vehicle and services. NASA would also provide one experiment, tracking, and backup for data acquisition, bmft was responsible for development of spacecraft and instrumentation operation and control of the satellite after launch, and data reduction and analysis except for the gsfc experiment. The spacecraft reentered 25 Sept. 1975.

At 9:32 am edt, the moment of launch, Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., unveiled a plaque designating the site a National Historical Landmark. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, told the thousands of guests: “No matter our achievements, ... we cannot relax our pursuit of knowledge, for we must face the coming crises of our time. Every effort must be made to see that the opportunity which our technology presents is not lost. We may be sure that the opportunity will not occur soon again, if ever. To fail now would mean a ravaged environment and depleted resources— a plunge into a new and terrible Dark Age from which there would be no return.” Unless “we continuously restore the fund of basic knowledge, we shall ultimately exhaust it. . . . “Some day we will establish scientific outposts on the Moon, and even tap its mineral resources. And in the not-too-distant future astronauts may tread the surface of Mars and the glaciers of the moons of Jupiter in search of extraterrestrial life. . . . The future began here at 9:32 a.m. on July 16, 1969. At that moment on July 16 in the year 2069, launch windows to Mars, Neptune, and Pluto will be open. Will we fly through those windows? I think we will.” In 19 July ceremonies at the San Clemente, Calif., Western White House, Armstrong presented President Nixon a plaque bearing the names of each astronaut who had represented “this country in a flight above the surface of the Earth.” President Nixon told Armstrong the greatest contribution to the space program was not the exploration or technology but the “spirit you and your colleagues . . . have had the opportunity to demonstrate.” The Smithsonian Institution hosted 20 July activities marking the day of the landing. Speaking on the Mall in Washington, D.C., Smithsonian Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks said Apollo 11 had been a “dramatic demonstration . . . that progress in human affairs does not spring full blown from the efforts of one man or group of men. What we saw was the culmination of the efforts of hundreds of scientists and engineers from Leonardo da Vinci ... to the Apollo 11 astronauts. Each built on what his predecessors had accomplished until the accumulation of knowledge made possible the kind of quantum leap forward represented by the Apollo Program.” Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, called the day of the landing “the day man ended an era of one-planet civilization and began a new age as traveler and colonizer of the universe.” Despite difficulties, men would “make more of these steps into the vast but exciting reaches of the solar system.” A 21 July service at the Washington Cathedral in Washington, D.C., dedicated the Space Window donated by Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator at the time of the landing. The window, designed by Rodney Winfield, depicted whirling orange, red, and white stars and orbiting planets on a deep blue and green field. A thin white trajectory, representing a manned spacecraft, emphasized man’s minuteness in God’s universe. During the ceremony, Armstrong presented a 7.18-g, 3.6-billion-yr-old lunar rock, brought from the moon by Apollo 11, to the Cathedral. The rock would be inserted into a hydrogen-filled plexiglass container embedded as the centerpiece of the window. (PD, 22 July 74, 815; NASA Activities, 15 Aug 74, 5-14; transcript; program)

Both proposals were designed to move the Earth Resources Technology Satellite system from an experimental to an operational phase. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, opposed the organizational changes proposed by the bills. He argued that S. 2350 would erect barriers in NASA between the erts system and related programs in NASA’s Office of Applications; keeping these programs together would facilitate hardware development and data reduction and handling. S. 3484 would limit NASA’s research and development in earth resources to activities supported and funded by the Dept, of the Interior. Citing the need for more spectral channels, more rapid handling of data, and more frequent repetitive coverage with ERTS-class satellites, Dr. Fletcher stated that there was no clear-cut distinction between experimental and operational phases in the earth resources program. What was needed was “a continuous evolutionary approach, in which operationally useful data from space are provided to users for research, for experimental demonstrations, and for routine operations when they are ready, while at the same time and with the same satellites necessary improvements to the system can be developed and used.” Proponents of the bills argued that erts data would be exploited fully only when users could be guaranteed the continuously available data offered by an operational system. Hearings would be continued 18 Sept. (Transcript)

Skylab . . . has demonstrated that this nation is capable of conducting broader and more useful beneficial activities in space that directly relate to our own planet Earth,” Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said at a postrecovery press briefing at Johnson Space Center. It had “moved the space program from the realm of the spectacular into a new phase that can be characterized ... as almost businesslike if not yet quite routine.” The Skylab experience was necessary for the future in space and had confirmed that NASA was proceeding in the right direction with development of the space shuttle. Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said 30 earth resources passes had been planned and 39 accomplished during the Skylab 4 mission. There had been 350 hrs of Apollo Telescope Mount observations planned and 338 hrs completed. Observations of Comet Kohoutek included 13 by the Apollo Telescope Mount and 111 by other instruments. All 28 planned corollary experiments and all major medical and student experiments had been completed. Original planning had called for 140 days in orbit for the three manned missions; 172 were accomplished. Skylab’s greatest achievement “was to prove . . . there is no limit in our space research”; the limit “is only our resolve, not our ability to do work, not the ability of men to work and not our technical knowledge.” (Transcript)

In an attempt to communicate with another civilization in the universe, a powerful three-minute radio signal was beamed from the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico toward Messier 13, a globular cluster of stars at the edge of the Milky Way, 25 000 light years from the earth. The transmission—devised by the staff of the National Astronomy and Atmosphere Center, which included the Observatory and was operated by Cornell Univ. for the National Science Foundation—was a coded message representing life on the earth. The Observatory’s new 450-kw radar transmitter, sponsored by NASA and completed in October, had increased the planetary ranging and surface mapping capabilities a thousandfold. When focused by the Observatory’s newly resurfaced 305-m dish the energy was multiplied, sending a beam to Messier 13 brighter than any other source in the Milky Way.

Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Science Vincent L. Johnson testified during FY 1975 NASA authorization hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications that the Thor-Delta launch vehicle improvement program begun in 1971 was nearing completion. The most modern Thor-Delta configuration, the 2914, was expected to fly for the first time during the April launch of Westar-A. Final decision for the launch was pending recommendation of the Failure Review Board set up at Goddard Space Flight Center to investigate the 2nd-stage failure of a Thor-Delta during the 18 Jan. Skynet IIA launch. NASA believed that, with the 2914 Delta, the present family of vehicles could launch any mission, but RCA Corp. had determined that a 30% to 35% increase in the 2914 Thor-Delta capability would permit a 24-channel, rather than the usual 12-channel, satellite to be launched into synchronous orbit, rca and McDonnell Douglas Corp. had agreed to share the cost of the uprating and McDonnell Douglas would reimburse NASA for technical direction. NASA had not agreed to make the new 3914 Thor-Delta a part of its launch family but probably would do so following successful proof flight. The first flight was scheduled for 1975. (Transcript)
The last of 130 new solid-state instrument landing systems were being delivered to Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration facilities worldwide. The Air Force Systems Command said the new ils, “one of the most significant improvements to aircraft landing equipment in 20 years,” would become the primary landing approach system at Air Force bases in two years, permitting instrument landings under weather conditions of 30-m vertical and 365-m horizontal visibility, (afsc Release oip 136.74)
The first of two C-130 transport aircraft with experimental boron-epoxy composite reinforced wing midsections was delivered to the Air Force to begin three years of tests. The joint nasa-tjsaf flight evaluation program was to demonstrate the fatigue resistance and weight reductions possible when the metal wing structures were reinforced with a composite of boron filaments embedded in an epoxy resin. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. would make periodic inspections and report to NASA and the Air Force, (nasa Release 74-290)
Gen. Carl A. Spaatz, first Air Force Chief of Staff, died in Washington, D.C., of congestive heart failure at the age of 83. Gen. Spaatz had been one of the first 25 Americans to earn “wings” as the Army’s First Aero Squadron in 1916. In 1929 Gen. Spaatz, with Gen. Ira S. Eaker, set a refueling endurance flight record by staying aloft 151 hrs over Los Angeles. For this feat he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. During World War II Gen. Spaatz commanded the largest armada of aircraft and airmen ever assembled under the control of a single commander. President Truman appointed him Chief of Staff when the Air Force became a separate branch of the military service in 1947. After his retirement in 1948 he served as chairman of the Civil Air Patrol.

The Air Force launched three satellites on a single Titan HID booster from Vandenberg Air Force Base—including S3-1, launched to measure air density, obtain upper-atmosphere composition data, and provide information on atmospheric effects on spacecraft orbits [see 7 Aug.]. The first satellite entered orbit with a 279-km apogee, 152-km perigee, 88.8-min period, and 96.7° inclination and reentered 19 March 1975. The second entered orbit with a 542-km apogee, 540-km perigee, 95.3-min period, and 96.1° inclination. The third entered orbit with a 3711-km apogee, 147-km perigee, 125.4-min period, and 97.0° inclination; it reentered 26 May 1975.

The first domestic communications satellite service, connecting East and West Coasts, was officially inaugurated by RCA Corp. from New York City at 2:40 pm edt. Within minutes, conversations were relayed by Canada’s Anik 2 satellite (launched by NASA 20 April 1973) on a circuit leased from Telesat Canada. Sen. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.) in New York, Federal Communications Chairman Dean Burch in Washington, D.C., Alaska Gov. William A. Egan in Juneau, Sen. Mike Gravel (D-Alaska) in Anchorage, and Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) in Nome exchanged congratulations. Operated by RCA Global Communications, Inc., and RCA Alaska Communications, Inc., for the parent RCA Corp., the system used earth relay stations near New York, San Francisco, Juneau, and Anchorage. These were to be joined by others in 1976, when RCA hoped to have three satellites of its own. Transmission charges for coast-to-coast messages were less via satellite than by earthbound systems; a telephone circuit rented for $1700 a month rather than the $2298 charged by American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for a similar land-based private circuit. Quality also was better because a connection could be completed with fewer relay points, one relay to the satellite and smother from the satellite to the ground, (rca Release, 8 Jan 74; W Star-News, 9 Jan 74; WSJ, 9 Jan 74,34)
President Ford signed S. 1283 into P.L. 93—577, the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974, to establish and conduct a national program of basic and applied research and development, including but not limited to demonstrations of practical applications, of all potentially beneficial energy sources and utilization technologies, within the Energy Research and Development Administration. (Text; PD, 6 Jan 75,14) During December: A total of 349 NASA Civil Service employees, including Associate Deputy Administrator Willis H. Shapley, retired under an “early out” retirement plan authorized by the Civil Service Commission-Under the plan employees could retire if they were at least 50 yrs of age and had 20 yrs of service or if they had 25 yrs of service, regardless of age. NASA had requested the retirement authority, which would extend through 28 Feb. 1975, to minimize effects of a reduction in force scheduled for February at Marshall Space Flight Center and of end of FY 1975 ceilings at Headquarters and elsewhere. NASA also announced a plan to reassign some Headquarters employees to Centers. Retirees included 50 at Headquarters, 50 at Goddard Space Flight Center, 78 at Langley Research Center, 68 at msfc, 28 at Lewis Research Center, 26 at Ames Research Center, 16 at Kennedy Space Flight Center, 14 at Johnson Space Flight Center, 10 at Flight Research Center, and 8 at Wallops Flight Center.

Communications Satellite Corp. announced it had signed a contract to provide technical and operational management for the global commercial satellite system owned by the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization. Under the contract, to run through 11 Feb. 1979, ComSatCorp would recommend and implement research and development programs; advise on procuring space segment facilities; negotiate, place, and administer all contracts for space segments; arrange for satellite launch services and support; prepare and coordinate system operations plans; and prepare and coordinate frequency plans for earth stations. (ComSatCorp Release 74-44) 30 Augusta-14 September: NASA launched Ans 1 Netherlands Astronomical Satellite from Western Test Range on a four-stage Scout launch vehicle at 7:08 am PDT (10:08 am edt). The satellite entered an elliptical polar orbit with a 1167-km apogee, 254-km perigee, 99.0-min period, and 98.1° inclination—significantly different from the planned circular orbit—because of a malfunction in the 1st stage of the Scout. Changes in the spacecraft program and scientific instrument operations program were made to accommodate to the actual orbit. Although the orbit hindered the observation program, the primary objective—to increase the scientific knowledge of stellar ultraviolet and x-ray sources—could be achieved. The spacecraft was pointed at the sun, the solar panels were deployed, and fine pointing in a three-axis stabilized condition was established. All three experiments—a hard x-ray experiment provided by the U.S. and a uv telescope and soft x-ray experiment provided by The Netherlands— were turned on by 8 Sept. In-orbit checkout of experiments and spacecraft was completed 13 Sept, and the operational phase of the mission began 14 Sept. Principal effect of the orbit on the scientific program was the loss of observing time. The higher apogee placed the spacecraft in the Van Allen radiation belts longer than planned, creating a more intense radiation background than anticipated. The uv telescope could operate effectively for 70% of each orbit and observe lOth-magnitude stars only when the spacecraft was below 500 km. Only 5th-magnitude or brighter stars were observable most of the time. The U.S. x-ray experiment could make effective observations about 25% of the total possible observing time; the experiment could operate below 700 km but not over the poles or the South Atlantic Anomaly. The soft x-ray experiment consisted of a large-area detector, which was operating similarly to the U.S. experiment, and a grazing-incidence telescope, which was seriously affected by the radiation background. Although much of the acquired data was not usable, most future data might be recovered through improved analysis techniques. Despite the problems, the orbit would provide nine months of full sunlight, rather than the six months expected, permitting reobservations of objects observed during the first three months. In addition, aerodynamic drag would lower the apogee over a period of time, decreasing the passage time through the Van Allen belts. Ans 1 was launched under a Memorandum of Understanding signed 5 June 1970 by NASA and the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite Program Authority (anspa) . NASA provided the x-ray experiment, spacecraft technical support, the Scout launch vehicle and services, and limited tracking and data acquisition. The Netherlands was responsible for the spacecraft design, fabrication, and testing; two experiments; and primary spacecraft command, control, and tracking and data acquisition. Ans 1 was the first satellite to be controlled completely from the European Space Research Organization’s operations center at Darmstadt, Germany. The ans program was managed for NASA by Goddard Space Flight Center under the direction of the Office of Space Science. Langley Research Center had responsibility for the Scout launch vehicle, (nasa mors, 21 Aug, 6 Nov 74; gsfc SSR, 31 Aug 74; gsfc proj mgr, interview, 15 July 75; esro Release, 23 Aug 74)
First wind-tunnel tests of a third-generation X—24 lifting body had been completed by Arnold Engineering Development Center, the Air Force Systems Command announced. A model of the proposed X-24C equipped with phase-change paint was exposed to a mach 6 airflow in a wind tunnel. By photographing the progression of the melt line formed fey the paint, engineers determined where heat built up and how quickly, around a new canopy designed for flights up to six times the speed of sound. The X-24A lifting body had flown test flights from 1969 to 1971 and the X-24B was continuing flights from Edwards Air Force Base in a NASA—usaf research program into concepts for future hypersonic aircraft and returning spacecraft. The X—24C was similar to the B model with the exception of the new canopy and omission of one vertical stabilizer. (afsc Release oip 158.74)

Tentative NASA plans for launching 810 payloads into space in the next two decades were outlined by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in an address before the National Space Club in Washington, D.C. The total, for late 1973 to 1991, included non-NASA payloads for Government agencies (other than the Dept, of Defense), foreign agencies, and private industry. The tentative payload model—presented to Congress in October 1973 to show “what could be done in the 1980s” when the space shuttle was in use—included as many as 10 missions to the outer planets Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, and Saturn. In 1990 and 1991 two very heavy payloads might be sent to orbit one of Jupiter’s moons and land an instrument package. Tentative missions to the inner planets included five missions to Venus, one of them with a lander, and two spacecraft to orbit Mercury. Tentative Mars missions included one spacecraft to orbit the planet, two landers, and two to return samples from the two moons of Mars. Lunar missions under consideration included a lunar polar orbiter in 1979, two other orbiters in the 1980s, two lunar rovers in the 1980s, a lunar halo satellite to ensure communications with the hidden side of the moon, and two lunar rovers in 1990 and 1991 that could return samples to the earth from any point on the moon. Other plans under consideration were a flyby and rendezvous with Comet Encke and a landing on the nucleus, a flyby of Haley’s Comet in 1985, and two missions to asteroids in 1986. Of the 810 total payloads, 57 were designated for planetary exploration and 753 for earth orbit. Scientific satellites for earth orbit were Large Space Telescopes, High Energy Astronomical Observatories, Large Solar Observatories, Large Radio Astronomy Observatories, and x-ray telescopes. The large spacecraft would be unmanned but visited regularly by space shuttle crews and brought back to earth for refurbishing. In the applications field were large Earth Observatory Satellites. And NASA expected to orbit 120 communications and navigation satellites for other agencies or private industry through 1991, not including those for DOD. Of some 300 payloads to be flown in the Spacelab, most would be NASA payloads in the fields of astronomy, physics, earth observations, earth and ocean physics, communication and navigation, life science, and space technology. Of non-NASA payloads, 10 would be for private industry space processing, beginning in 1985. Some 10% were expected to be flown for foreign users. The large number of contemplated missions, even with the increasing number of U.S.S.R. launches, was expected to have very little impact on the environment. Effects of the major constituents of the solid-fueled rocket booster exhaust—water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and aluminum oxide—would be negligible. (Text)

NASA launched Symphonie 1, French and West German experimental communications satellite, at 9:39 pm est from Eastern Test Range on a three-stage, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta launch vehicle. The 402-kg satellite entered a transfer orbit with a 38 071-km apogee, 402-km perigee, 688.2-min period, and 13.2° inclination. Nine seconds after the Thor-Delta’s 3rd stage separated from the 2nd stage, the inertial measurement unit (the altitude-sensing portion in the 2nd-stage guidance system) stopped functioning, but the failure did not affect the path of the already separated 3rd stage. In addition, the main engine cutoff was achieved by fuel depletion with 430 kg liquid oxygen remaining instead of with the planned depletion. The anomalies, which did not affect the mission, were under investigation. Ground controllers in West Germany activated the apogee kick motor, the first using liquid propellant, at 6:00 pm est 21 Dec., putting the spacecraft in circular geosynchronous orbit with 35 810-km apogee, 35 767-km perigee, 23-hr 56-min period, and 0.3° inclination. The spacecraft was despun and three-axis-stabilized and its large solar panels were successfully deployed 24 Dec. Symphonie 1 drifted eastward to its final station at 115° W longitude over the west coast of Africa and began operations 2 Jan. 1975. The NASA mission objective—to launch the spacecraft into a transfer orbit that would permit the onboard propulsion system to place it in an accurate synchronous orbit—was satisfied and the mission was adjudged successful 6 Jan. Symphonie 1 would provide 1200 telephone circuits, 8 voice channels, and 2 color TV channels for experimental communications between Europe, Africa, and South America. The first of two Symphonie satellites, provided for by a French-West Germany agreement signed June 1967, the satellite was developed by a French-German industrial consortium under the direction of the French Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (cnes) and the West German Gesell-schaft fur Weltraumforschung (Gfw). In October 1973 NASA agreed to provide the launch vehicle and services on a cost-reimbursable basis and in June 1974 signed a launch services contract with CNES-Gfw. Goddard Space Flight Center in cooperation with French and West German ground stations was responsible for tracking the spacecraft during launch and transfer orbit operations. GSFC was also responsible for the launch vehicle. (nasa mors, 13 Dec 74, 6 Jan 75; NASA prog off, interview, 29 Aug 75; NASA Release 74-316)
The Air Force was developing a new series of global meteorological satellites for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (dmsp) , Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. The new Block 5D spacecraft would be twice the weight of its predecessors, have a payload capacity about four times greater, and carry a broader mix of meteorological sensors to provide uniformly high-resolution photos. Block 5D satellites would employ “selective redundancy”—redundancy in certain critical, rather than all, spacecraft systems. This redundancy would increase probable mission lifetime to two years, more than twice the 9- or 10-mo lifetime of most earlier USAF weather satellites. Rather than choosing a single contractor, the USAF had awarded a series of fixed-price contracts: to RCA Corp. for the spacecraft, Westinghouse Electric Corp. for the primary sensor, Barnes Engineering Co. for the supplementary sensors, and Radiation, Inc., for ground terminals.

Fraudulent transmissions to Johnson Space Center purporting to be from Skylab 4 astronauts, working in the Orbital Workshop since their 16 Nov. 1973 launch, were heard during a telephone call to New York City from Unifi, Inc., in North Carolina. The supposed astronauts described “an approximately 10-megaton explosion” on the spacecraft as they took military photos of silos over Moscow. After the “astronauts” said they were sending scrambled messages “on channel 5 and channel B,” they were heard supposedly speaking to President Nixon at the White House. They acknowledged that their wives had been notified and were being flown to Houston. The voices then reported that their “secret documents and equipment” had been jettisoned. The transmissions then abruptly ended. The press later reported that 12 other persons had heard similar “space messages.” A Houston area telephone company employee was later'taken into custody.

Design work on the primary rescue system for space shuttle passengers proceeded at Johnson Space Center. A prototype “beach ball” large enough for a person to crawl into, zip up, and pressurize had been demonstrated and given a go-ahead at NASA Hq. in December 1973. Assistant Chief for Shuttle Larry E. Bell in jsc’s Crew Systems Div. had told a news interviewer the balls could be packaged into cylinders to accompany each passenger aboard the shuttle in the 1980s, “almost like a parachute.” Simplicity, size, light weight, structural strength of the ball shape, and low cost had won approval over expensive and complicated spacesuits for nonastronauts on flights and eliminated the requirement for a rescue docking module. In an emergency, passengers could enter the balls—each with its own window—an hour or two before rescue by a second shuttle. Oxygen containers connected to the shuttle supply system would be used until just before rescue; a device would remove carbon dioxide. Once disconnected, each container would last an hour; transfer through space to the rescue shuttle was expected to take 30 min. (Bell interview, 4 March 75; Hill, H Chron, 21 April *74)

Leonov, and the exploration of the moon by American astronauts, were only “milestones along the road of exploration of outer space.” ASTP would be another step. The joint Soviet-American mission had become possible, not only because of the efforts of scientists, but also because of the “conditions of a favorable political climate established in Soviet-American relations as a result of the fruitful . . . summit meetings.” The main task was to see that “these changes become irreversible.” astp would go a long way toward “making space exploration really internationalist.” (Tass, fbis-Sov, 14 Feb 74, B6)

Rep. Charles A. Vanik (D-Ohio) said that he was becoming impatient waiting “for an energy efficient* American automobile which can meet our pollution standards.” It was “time we truly involved NASA—on a massive scale—in solving our earth-bound problems.” Carl E. Nash of the Public Interest Research Group suggested that serious consideration be given the Dept, of Transportation or the Environmental Protection Agency, rather than NASA, when giving authority for ground propulsion research and development, because these agencies had had more experience in the field. Sydney L. Terry, Vice President for Public Responsibility and Consumer Affairs at Chrysler Corp., said many had questioned whether the Federal Government had a legitimate role in automotive propulsion technology, but Chrysler would “welcome NASA’s interest in the automobile with enthusiasm and hope.” NASA’s skill and experience in long-range basic research and in the fields of thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and aerodynamics could contribute substantially to the development of efficient transportation. The way to proceed was by a “thoughtful division of research and development work between Government and industry.” (Transcript)

Construction of the $22-million runway for the space shuttle was begun at Kennedy Space Center after a brief ground-breaking ceremony at the construction site northwest of the Vehicle Assembly Building. Dr. Debus, KSC Director, said the shuttle would lead to a “new era of international transportation to and from space” and the “boom and bust of the 1960s of this community and the activities of the government will be changed to a more steady—more reliable—situation.” The 90-m wide, 4600-m long, 40-cm thick runway would accommodate a 75 000-kg spacecraft returning from space at a 15° to 20° angle and at a speed of nearly 295 km per hr. More than 8000 km of grooves in the surface would permit drainage and prevent hydroplaning while " landing in the rain. To reduce the speed of the returning shuttle, astronauts would have the help of brakes, parachutes, and a net at the end of the runway. The runway was scheduled for July 1976 completion.

The Titan IIIE-Centaur proof-flight vehicle (TC-1), launched by NASA from Eastern Test Range Complex 41 at 9:48 am edt carrying a Viking spacecraft model and the sphinx satellite, was destroyed after the Centaur engine failed to start. At 8.1 min from launch, after normal separation from the Titan booster, the Centaur main-engine start failed and the vehicle automatically went into the restart sequence. A second attempt to start the engine failed at 9.2 min after liftoff. Since the vehicle had not achieved orbital velocity the Range Safety Officer at the Antigua, West Indies, tracking station transmitted destruction commands and the Centaur was destroyed at 12,5 min after the liftoff. The vehicle fell into the Atlantic Ocean 3530 km downrange. Inflight data indicated that the liquid-oxygen boost pump had failed to operate during both attempted engine starts. A committee was formed to investigate the failure and recommend corrective action. Although the primary objective of demonstrating the capability of the Titan-Centaur launch vehicle was not accomplished, some objectives were fulfilled: demonstration of the capability of the launch facility to support a Titan-Centaur launch, structural integrity of the vehicle, Centaur guidance and control of the Titan, Titan-Centaur separation, and Centaur standard shroud capability. The Viking Dynamic Simulator had been instrumented to verify flight loads for the two planned 1975 missions to Mars. Remaining attached to the Centaur stage, the vds was to have flown a typical Viking launch trajectory with a shortened bum to limit the spacecraft to a low earth orbit, to test the guidance system, and estimate injection accuracy. The sphinx Space Plasma High Voltage Interaction Experiment spacecraft had been intended for launch into an elliptical orbit to investigate the effect of charged particles in space on high-voltage solar cells, insulators, and conductors. The launch vehicle combined NASA’s versatile high-energy liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen Centaur upper stage with the Air Force-developed Titan III booster, a two-stage liquid-propellant core rocket augmented by two strap-on solid-fueled rocket motors. It was designed to fill the performance and cost gap between the Atlas-Centaur and the Saturn vehicles and boost NASA’s heaviest unmanned payloads into orbit or interplanetary trajectories. The first of six scheduled operational missions—the U.S. and West German Helios solar probe scheduled for the fall—would be configured to a two-burn mission to obtain data lost on the proof flight. The Titan-Centaur program was managed by NASA’s Office of Space Science. Lewis Research Center was responsible for the Titan-Centaur system.

The FY 1975 NASA budget plan for new authorization of $3,247 billion and spending of $3,273 billion, although a “constrained budget,” would carry forward the programs planned in FY 1974. Goals and major programs were the same, with three new projects in space science and applications, but the space shuttle had been slipped four to six months. NASA’s FY 1974 budget had “reflected a sharp temporary reduction, because of Government-wide fiscal problems . . . , below the $3.4 billion level previously planned as the long-term level.” Increases in FY 1975 and later years were therefore “in order to approach again the level required to maintain . . . advances in space and aeronautics for the rest of the decade.” The FY 1975 increase of “about $100 million,” however, was less than required to return to NASA’s complete program as planned, and adjustments had been necessary. Principally, the first manned orbital flight of the shuttle was rescheduled to the second quarter of 1979, instead of the end of 1978, but NASA had a “firm commitment now” that there would be no more slips for budgetary reasons, and none was expected for technical reasons. NASA Comptroller William E. Lilly said at the briefing the stretchout was expected to increase shuttle costs about $50 million “in 1971 dollars.” The $800 million requested for the shuttle was $89 million less than NASA had submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. In the three new space flight projects, Pioneer Venus had top scientific priority as the next step in planetary exploration. Two missions launched in 1978 would study the Venus atmosphere for a better understanding of that planet and of the earth’s atmosphere, meteorology, and climatology. In the second new start, seasat, an experimental applications satellite, would measure ocean characteristics to aid scientific understanding of ocean dynamics and determine if a forecasting system could be developed, seasat-a was to be launched in 1978. The third start, the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (hcmm), would launch an Explorer satellite in 1977 to make thermal measurements of the earth’s surface to help find mineral resources and potential geothermal energy sources and to discriminate rock structures for planning civil works such as highways. NASA was asking $6 million to build the world’s first large infrared telescope, on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, for planetary research to complement planetary space flights, especially to provide data for the 1977 launch of the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probe. Another new thrust, still in the planning stage, was the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss) , to return the large amounts of data expected from the shuttle in the 1980s and permit phase-out of some tracking stations. NASA would not develop the spacecraft for the TDRSS but would lease satellite services from a private organization, beginning in CY1979. Analysis of data from the Skylab missions that were ending with the 8 Feb. splashdown of Skylab 4 would continue for many years. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project joint engineering and training activities with the U.S.S.R. were on schedule. All shuttle hardware prime contractors and most subcontractors had been selected, and the Dept, of Defense tentatively planned to modify an existing upper stage for use as an interim space tug with, the shuttle. Erts 1, launched 23 July 1972, was still working well, exceeding its design life by more than six months. ERTS-b, previously planned for 1976 launch, had been moved to 1975. A number of nasa and 11 commercial applications launches were scheduled during the year. A nominal communications satellite research program would be continued. In space astronomy, oso-i was scheduled for 1975 and the heAo series would be resumed, with launches planned for 1977, 1978, and 1979. Astronautics programs would continue to develop technology to improve fuel economy, reduce noise, and improve performance of U.S.-built civil transport aircraft. nasa’s Civil Service employment was to be stabilized at the end of FY 1974 levels except for a further reduction of 354 persons at Marshall Space Flight Center following completion of Skylab. NASA’s FY 1975 total would be 24 616, about 2200 less than in FY 1973 and 354 less than in FY 1974. Support service contractors at the Centers had reductions planned at about the same level, the 25 000 FY 1973 total dropping to 24 000 in FY 1974 and to 22 000 in FY 1975.

Charles A. Lindbergh—the first man to fly solo nonstop from New York to Paris, in 1927—died of cancer on Maui, Hawaii, at the age of 72. He was buried three hours later in a simple funeral near the Kipahulu church on Maui. In Washington, President Ford said: “Nearly half a century has passed since his courageous solo flight . . . but the courage and daring of his feat will never be forgotten. For years to come, we will also remember the selfless, sincere man himself . .., one of America’s alltime heroes and a great pioneer of the air age that changed the world.” For the transatlantic flight, airmail pilot and barnstormer Lindbergh had helped design a Ryan monoplane, calculating every ounce. When the Spirit of St. Louis landed at Le Bourget airfield, Paris, at 10:22 pm 21 May 1927 after a 33-hr 29-min flight, Lindbergh was greeted by 25 000 wildly cheering persons. British, French, and Belgian governments awarded the flyer their highest decorations for valor. He received the first U.S. Distinguished Flying Cross and the Medal of Honor and was promoted from lieutenant to colonel in the Army Air Corps Reserve. Following goodwill flights throughout the U.S. and Latin America, sponsored by the Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, Lindbergh served as adviser to Pan American World Airways and to the predecessor of Trans World Airlines, helping to lay out transatlantic, transcontinental, and Caribbean air routes for commercial aviation. He served as a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 1931-1939, heading the special committee that recommended to Congress expansion of U.S. aircraft research facilities and establishment of what became the Ames and Lewis Research Centers. After the kidnaping and murder of his first son and the subsequent publicity, Lindbergh moved to Europe in 1935, where he studied the military forces of the European countries. His conclusion that the German Luftwaffe would be superior to the combined forces of the Allies, his acceptance of the Service Cross of the German Eagle from the German government, and his opposition to U.S. participation in World War II provoked the U.S. public to question his patriotism and he resigned his commission in the Army Air Corps. During the war he was a consultant to bomber aircraft manufacturers Ford Motor Co. and United Aircraft Corp. He traveled to the Pacific war area in 1944 to study the Navy’s Corsair F-4U under flying conditions and there, as a civilian, flew 50 missions against the Japanese. Following the war, his commission restored and promoted to the rank of brigadier general, Lindbergh was a technical consultant for Government and private industry in missile and space flight programs. As a consultant for Pan Am he worked on design specifications for the Boeing 747. Lindbergh devoted the later years of his life to writing and speaking on world conservation policies.

Goddard Space Flight Center launched an Aerobee 200 sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range to study Comet Kohoutek’s ultraviolet rays. The rocket carried cameras, spectrometers, and other instruments to 232.6-km altitude to determine amounts of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide in the comet. The flight was “highly successful,” Dr. Stephen P. Maran, gsfc Manager of Operation Kohoutek, said. The comet, discovered 5 May 1973 by Czechoslovak astronomer Dr. Lubos Kohoutek, was once predicted to be the “comet of the century” as it passed near the earth on its 75 000-yr journey around the sun. It was only twice as bright as nearby stars but reflected enough light to permit instruments to be aimed at it precisely.

The nasa Space Shuttle Cost and Review Committee recommended program changes to Dr. James C. Fletcher, Administrator, to reduce rising costs. It also reported design changes made necessary by thermal weight constraints. The committee, headed by nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight John F. Yardley, recommended delaying the second shuttle orbiter flight, refurbishing the first test orbiter earlier than planned instead. Deferrals of three months to two years were recommended for components of the second shuttle launch complex at Kennedy Space Center, which had originally been scheduled for completion about the time of the first shuttle flights. Also recommended was a delay in the development of improved spacesuits and portable life support systems for extravehicular activities from the space shuttle. Instead, evas would use Apollo-style hardware. Emergency barriers on shuttle runways and a building at Ksc for installing fairings and parachutes on solid-fueled rocket motors were judged unnecessary. Some tests were recommended for cancellation. Design changes to accommodate thermal and weight constraints included payload doors of a graphite epoxy composite that expanded less when heated and weighed 400 kg less than die aluminum composite originally planned for use. Solid-fueled-rocket separation motors that would provide a higher thrust level for a shorter time when separating die large solid-propellant boosters from the orhiter after launch were found to cause no orbiter damage—solving a possible problem anticipated with the original separation motors. The committee also recommended switching to a new thermal coating material for the external liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen tank to prevent tank overheating during launch, (nasa prog off, interview, 22 Sept 75; Av Wk, 9 Sept 74, 9-10; NASA Off of Admin, Daily Appointments Calendar)
The economy of Florida’s Brevard County was recovering from the impact of Kennedy Space Center layoffs that had followed the end of NASA’s Apollo and Skylab programs, the Washington Post reported. Employment at the launch facilities had formed the basis for Brevard County’s economy and when manpower at ksc was cut in half “the bottom dropped out.” Construction came to a near halt, small businesses closed, and personal bankruptcies soared. By March 1971 the Federal Housing Administration held title to 986 repossessed Brevard County homes and the total tripled in the next three years. However, an advertising campaign, begun in 1971 to attract retired persons to the area and its vacant bargain real estate, started an upswing in the economy. Also contributing to the upswing were a pledge that NASA would not let its ksc manpower fall below the current 9500-employee (Civil Service and contractor) level, assurances that the Air Force would maintain its 13 300-man work force at Eastern Test Range for the next five years, construction of a new regional shopping center, and the advent of Disney World 95 km away.

Communications Satellite Corp. submitted its 11th annual report to the President and Congress. FY 1974 had included the launch of Intelsat-IV F—7 (23 Aug. 1973) and the Comsat General Corp. award of a $65 900 000 contract to Hughes Aircraft Co. for four high-capacity satellites to be used by American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for domestic communications early in 1976. By 30 June, the number of communications satellite pathways had increased by about 60 to a total of 325, with earth stations in 55 countries. With the addition of 10 more users, the number of countries, territories, and possessions leasing satellite services had exceeded 100. Half circuits leased full time in the global satellite system had increased from 8434 in 1973 to 9627 by 30 June 1974, a gain of about 14%. This voice and record traffic had accounted for the majority of all intercontinental long-distance communications. Net income had risen to $36.3 million, a 45% increase over FY 1973.

Dr. James R. Schlesinger, Secretary of Defense, announced plans to consider full-scale development of an air combat fighter (acf) as an alternative to costly tactical aircraft. The best option, he said, would be to follow the Air Force lightweight fighter prototype program-—including the YF—16 and YF—17—with an acf development program. Advocates later said the acf could defend bases from fighter attack while larger aircraft such as the F-4 and F—15 carried the battle to an enemy hundreds of kilometers away, (dod Release 171-74; AP, W Post, 30 April 74, A6)
Pan American World Airways, Inc., ordered a cockpit ground-proximity warning system installed on its entire 140-aircraft fleet. The device, designed by Sundstrand Data Control, Inc., would sound a loud “Whoop! Whoop! Pull up!” and flash a red light reading “terrain” if an aircraft was heading for a mountain slope or was too low on takeoff or landing. The decision to install the equipment had been hastened by recent aircraft accidents, including the 22 April crash of a Pan Am aircraft into a Bali, Indonesia, mountaintop, -which had killed 107 persons. (Witkin, NYT, 9 May 74)
Research into automotive propulsion systems was reviewed by NASA, Dept, of Transportation, and Environmental Protection Agency officials in hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. H.R. 10392 had been introduced 19 Sept. 1973 to authorize nasa research toward development of economical, energy-conserving systems with clean emissions and improved performance. Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, testified 4 Feb. that Lewis Research Center was testing epa’s experimental engine, under a June 1973 agreement with epa on work toward a low-pollution gas-turbine-powered vehicle. Upgraded engine work would be completed by mid-1975 and vehicle performance evaluation before the end of CY 1975. First results of Jet Propulsion Laboratory investigations of hydrogen injection into fuel to improve efficiency and reduce pollution in conventional automobile engines promised achievement of 1977 Federal emission standards with 25% improvement in fuel economy. LeRC Director Bruce T. Lundin testified that, in addition to the gas turbine engine, a broader, longer range, advanced technology program was under way, with 13 industry contracts for such improvements as a low-emission combustor, higher-temperature heat exchangers, lower-cost turbine discs, turbine wheel cooling, and low-cost fuel controls. Dr. William H. Pickering, Jpl Director, reported a test automobile using bottled gas to inject hydrogen into the fuel had already met the carbon monoxide emission standard and had almost met the nitrogen oxide standard, although the hydrocarbon emissions remained a problem. With engine modifications to produce hydrogen from gasoline, instead of using bottled gas, performance per gallon of fuel was expected to improve 25% over the conventional engine. (Transcript) 4- 8 February: The first meeting of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization’s Assembly of Parties was held in Washington, D.C. Seventy-two of the eighty-four member governments were represented. Raymond J. Waldmann (U.S.) was elected Chairman and Dr. Osama Anani (Jordan) was elected Deputy Chairman. Elected as Vice-chairmen were Ambassador Alejandro Orfila (Argentina), Ambassador Adolfo Alessandrini (Italy), Ambassador Leonard 0. Kibinge (Kenya), and Ambassador Motoo Ogiso (Japan). The Assembly of Parties found that the proposed U.S. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (goes) and maritime satellite system would not interfere with the intelsat system, goes was technically compatible with the use of the radio-frequency spectrum and orbital space by the existing or planned satellites. The maritime satellite system would not prejudice direct satellite telecommunication links. The Assembly refused a United Nations request for free use of INTELSAT satellites, although a priority access arrangement, for periods not exceeding 90 days during an emergency, would be worked out. (intelsat Release 74-12). 5- 22 February: Mariner 10, launched 3 Nov. 1973, passed within 5800 km of Venus—within 15 km of the planned aim point—at 1:01 pm edt 5 Feb. The encounter sequence was accomplished according to plan and data were transmitted over the 45 million km between the earth and Venus at a rate of 117.6 kilobits per sec. Excellent ultraviolet cloud-structure pictures and new data on particle environment and mass, density, and shape of the planet were returned. Because Mariner 10 approached Venus on the dark side, the TV sequence was not begun until shortly before the encounter, at 12:21 pm edt. The spacecraft flew behind Venus at 1:07 pm edt for 20 min; TV signals were stored on tape and recovered without difficulty after Mariner 10 emerged from the occultation zone. During occultation, the spacecraft’s radio antenna was aimed toward the edge of the planet so that the radio signals were bent around Venus by the extremely dense atmosphere and sent on to the earth. All science instruments functioned normally except the scanning electrostatic analyzer. The TV sequence was completed 13 Feb. after some 4165 pictures were returned to the earth. During the flyby, the 503-kg spacecraft used the gravitational field of Venus to slow its speed and direct the flight path toward a 29 March encounter with Mercury. By 22 Feb. Mariner 10—its speed increasing as it came nearer the sun—was traveling 3 million km per day toward the planet. Preliminary science results were presented at a press briefing 7 Feb. at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Herbert S. Bridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, said the solar wind was interacting with the ionosphere of Venus, producing a magnetic tail that could be detected as a modified plasma flow as far out from the planet as 500 Venus radii. Dr. James A. Dunne, Mariner project scientist, said the magnetic field doubled just before radio occultation but that no evidence of an intrinsic planetary magnetic field was found. Preliminary radio science results indicated that Venus was very round, 100 times less oblate than the earth, and confirmed that Venus had a dayside ionosphere. The mass of the planet was slightly less than that derived from previous data. Hydrogen was a major element of the Venus cloud deck, possibly present in droplets of sulfuric acid as well as water vapor. Manner 10 found no evidence of deuterium on the planet, indicating that the hydrogen had originated from the solar wind. Helium, carbon, and atomic oxygen were found in the atmosphere, with possible traces of argon and neon. Outer atmosphere temperature of 590 K (600°F) was suggested. TV data indicated a uniform main cloud deck with three or four layers and a stratified haze layer. TV pictures in uv showed a classical “Y” feature that originated in the equatorial region and spiraled toward the pole. Clear circulation patterns could be seen at the poles, caused by rising gas transporting excess solar heat from the equatorial zone by convection. The atmosphere was smooth, with no swirling storms, (nasa mor, 11 March 74; Briefing transcript; Sullivan, NYT, 5 Feb. 74, 18; 6 Feb. 74, 1; Miles, LA Times, 6 Feb 74)

Data from Pioneer 10 taken during its 3 Dec. 1973 encounter with Jupiter had indicated that the upper atmosphere of the planet was 400 K (260°F), about 480 K (520° F) hotter than previously calculated. Dr. Arvydas J. Kliore, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist, said at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Temperatures deeper down in the atmosphere rose to as much as 700 K (800°F), the highest temperature found so far on any planet in the solar system. The findings suggested that the surface temperature could reach 5800 K (10 000°F), the surface temperature of the sun. The surprising heat might be explained by heavy dust layers in the upper levels of the atmosphere that absorbed solar radiation or absorbed heat radiating away from the surface of the planet. • Dr. Fred L. Whipple, retired Director of the Smithsonian Astro-physical Observatory, said that methyl cyanide and hydrogen cyanide, two compounds always identified with interstellar dust, had been found in abundance in Comet Kohoutek. The discovery marked the first time the chemicals had been identified with a comet and the first time they had been seen in space inside the solar system. “It . . . increases the suspicion that comets were formed . . . out at about 30 trillion km or halfway to the nearest star.” {W Post, 5 April 74, A29; 7 April 74, A3)
NASA authorized two flight kits for Apollo-Soyuz astronauts: an official flight kit, containing selective items for memorabilia, and an astronaut preference kit, containing 20 personal items selected individually. Special flight items having particular significance for the mission would be suggested by the Director, Johnson Space Center, and approved by the Administrator. (NASA nmi 8020.19B)
The Air Force’s first flight-test B-l strategic bomber had been successfully mated with its wings iir Palmdale, Calif., the Air Force Systems Command announced. The B-l was being developed by prime contractor Rockwell International Corp. to provide a modern supersonic strategic manned bomber to replace the aging B-52. The B-l, designed to carry twice the payload of the B-52 at three times the speed, was equipped with movable fore and aft wings to carry out a variety of missions from both normal and short runways, in addition to low-level operation at high subsonic speeds and high-altitude supersonic flight, (afsc Release OIP 001.74)
The economic return from the U.S. space program amounted to 33% per year, exceeding the typical yield from investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate, Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., Johnson Space Center Director, said in a speech at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. at Blacksburg, Va. Among returns not immediately visible to the public were some 30000 inventions available by the end of the Apollo program. The price of Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite—surveying the earth since its launch 23 July 1972—was less than 50 cents per American. “Given its potential for aiding us in the coming years, who would not support a program that costs less than a . . . half-pound [one fourth kilogram] of ground beef?” Dr. Kraft estimated that the space shuttle, at an annual cost of $5 for each American, was an investment that would “pay, perhaps, the greatest return to future generations.” With such a vehicle we could not only perform a variety of scientific studies with immediate application to life on earth but build permanent, space stations and launch planetary vehicles and eventually starships. The space shuttle program, with its international cooperation, would unite “many nations for the benefit of all.” (Text)
A new artificial limb had been developed by Kennedy Space Center and Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in California, icsc announced. The strapless device was attached directly to the amputee’s bone through a carbon collar that remained at skin level. Originally developed for rocket motors, the high-purity carbon material would not cause infection in patients. Previously, the body’s rejection of foreign materials and the failure of the skin to form a hygienic seal had prevented direct attachment to the bone. A quick-release ball connector for the limb was based on a device that held rocket umbilical attachments in place until liftoff, (ksc Release 134-74)

Three Kitt Peak National Observatory astronomers announced they had photographed large-scale structures, hot and cold regions, that were probably convection currents in the atmosphere of Alpha Orionis (the star Betelguese in the Constellation Orion), 500 light years from the earth. The announcement, made in Florida at the American Astronomical Society’s annual meeting, was based on photos made 28 March using the four-meter Mayall Telescope. A new technique of interferometry analysis had permitted reconstruction of the star’s image. In resolving the disc of Betelguese, the Kitt Peak astronomers became the first observers to distinguish actual forms on a star other than the sun. (nsf Release 74-229)

Although smaller and lighter than the B-52 it was meant to replace, the B-l could fly farther and faster, carry almost twice the payload, and use a shorter runway. Powered by four 133.4-kilonewton-thrust (30 000-lb) turbofan engines and lifted by variable geometry, or “swing” wings, the bomber could fly efficiently at speeds in excess of mach 2.

Data would be used to forecast atmospheric responses to solar activity, to compensate for communications blackouts of satellite and warning systems, and to provide real-time solar-alert and analysis data. Operational testing would begin early in 1976, with the network to become fully operational over a three-year period, (afsc Release oip 132.74)
NASA announced two Kennedy Space Center contract awards for space shuttle facilities. Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc., had been given a $21 812 737 contract to construct a space shuttle runway with overruns, apron, taxiway, and access roads. The runway—to be completed within 850 days after the notice to proceed—was to be built northwest of the Vehicle Assembly Building. Reynolds, Smith, and Hills received a $1 463 000 fixed-price contract to design modifications to Launch Complex 39 and Mobile Launcher 3 for shuttle operations. Complex 39, Apollo and Skylab launch site, would next be used for a manned flight in 1975, for the U.S.—U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. (NASA Releases 74-66, 74-67)
A new Air Force air-traffic-control radar system that could track aircraft approaching a runway in heavy rain would be put into full production, the Air Force Systems Command announced. The an/tpn-19, to be produced by Raytheon Co., consisted of an operational shelter, an airport surveillance radar to detect aircraft within 97 km and direct them to final approach entry positions, and a precision-approach radar to guide aircraft along the 32-km final approach. The all-weather, $2 617 000 sysfem could be transported anywhere in the world and be operational within two hours, (afsc Release OIP 181.73)
Johnson Space Center had issued requests to 11 interested aerospace companies to submit contract proposals for computing and data processing for space program software systems, JSC announced. Primary objective of the contract would be to define, design, .develop, and maintain software systems (for space shuttle, earth resources, and other science programs) that had maximum flexibility for supporting a wide variety of missions and future requirements. The cost-plus-award-fee contract would run from 1 July 1974 through 31 Dec. 1979. (JSC Release 74-30)
Aerospace companies that had succeeded in using the system approach to develop advanced technology for use in space were encountering difficulties in the field of urban mass transportation, a New York Times article said. Boeing Co. Aerospace Div. faced losses of up to $6 million on an automated “people mover” shuttle system in Morgantown, W. Va. Cost of the project, chosen four years ago as a pilot application of aerospace management techniques, had jumped from the original estimate of S13.4 million to $115 million. Rohr Industries, Inc., had lost more than $10 million on a project to build 450 commuter cars for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit System, which had threatened to sue Rohr over late deliveries and alleged unreliability of some cars. Observers had noted that aerospace technologists tended to “overengineer” transit systems, increasing costs, aggravating maintenance, and marring reliability. In addition there were problems in converting prototypes to hardware that could withstand the rigors of carrying throngs of people. But, despite the frustrations, more companies were entering the competition. A significant test of how the aerospace industry would fare in the next era of transit development would be the performance of Boeing’s Vertol Div. in two projects to produce 230 streetcars for Boston and San Francisco and 100 cars for Chicago’s rapid transit system. (Lindsey, AFT1,21 April 74, 3:1) Dr. Alastair G. W. Cameron, Harvard College Observatory scientist, said that an enormous spherical cloud of comets with a combined mass 20 times that of Jupiter might lie beyond the planets and form a far more massive part of the universe than the planets. This cloud, the Oort cloud, might be a repository for heavy elements formed since the infancy of the Milky Way. Dr. R. W. Klebesadel of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory said that satellites, placed in a 100 000-km orbit as part of the Air Force Vela series developed to monitor the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has monitored 27 high-intensity explosions in space over four years. The explosions, which had produced unusually large amounts of gamma and x-ray energy, might be in the Orion arm of the galaxy, where the earth was. Dr. Philip Morrison of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said nine current theories of the origin of the explosions included exploding stars, or supernovas; objects falling into neutron stars; and unusually large solar flares or sunstorms on distant stars.

A new method using tiny electronic body sensors, developed by Ames Research Center for remotely recording physical responses during space flight training and research programs, was being used to measure the precise walking patterns of children with cerebral palsy, NASA announced. Patients could be free of cumbersome equipment that had hindered obtaining accurate gait measurements. (NASA Release 74-131) 17—24 May: Sms 1 (sms-a Synchronous Meteorological Satellite)—first meteorological satellite in synchronous orbit—was launched by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from Eastern Test Range at 5:31 am edt. The lst-stage propulsion of the three-stage Thor-Delta launch vehicle was less than normal. The 2nd stage burned to near propellant completion, compensating for the deficiency but leaving insufficient propellant to complete the planned second burn. The spacecraft entered a lower-than-planned transfer orbit with a 32 895km apogee, 180-km perigee, 9-hr 37-min period, and 24.5° inclination. The apogee boost motor boosted the spacecraft into a near-geostationary orbit with a 32 828.3-km apogee, 30 747-km perigee, 20-hr 39-min period, and 2.0° inclination, with an eastward drift of approximately 56° per day. The auxiliary propulsion system was fired at 3:00 am EDT 19 May to place the spacecraft in operational attitude. A planned series of aps firings between 19 and 24 May increased the orbit to geosynchronous altitude, eliminated orbital drift, and stopped the satellite at 45° west longitude. An early post-launch review of flight data revealed no spacecraft anomalies, and the first photos were transmitted 24 May. NASA objectives—to launch the spacecraft into a geosynchronous orbit of sufficient accuracy to accomplish operational mission requirements and evaluate and check out the spacecraft—were met and the mission was adjudged successful 17 Dec. Operational control was turned over to NOAA10 Dec. after checkout. The 272-kg satellite (628 kg at launch) would, for the first time, provide continuous day and night images of cloud cover over the U.S. and Atlantic Ocean. Its data-collection systems would be key elements in the Global Atmospheric Research Program’s Atlantic Tropical Experiment to be conducted during the summer, collecting meteorological, hydrological, oceanographic, seismic, and tsunami data. In addition, Sms 1 would monitor solar flare activity for future manned spacecraft and supersonic aircraft flights. Sms 1 was the first in a series which would include two operational prototypes and one operational spacecraft (sms-c, to become Goes 1 on launch), developed and funded by NASA to meet the requirements of the Dept, of Commerce for its Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (goes) system. The sms project was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under the direction of the Office of Applications. GSFC also had responsibility for the Thor-Delta launch vehicle.

Dr. Edward U. Condon, a leading U.S. atomic scientist, died at the age of 72 in Boulder, Colo., of complications from heart disease. In 1940 Dr. Condon had become a member of the National Defense Research Council and, in 1941, a member of the Roosevelt Committee on Uranium Research. During the World War II he played an important role in the development of the atomic bomb. In 1945 Dr. Condon had been appointed Director of the National Bureau of Standards but resigned in 1951 because of House Un-American Activities Committee investigations as a “weak” security link. In 1952 he appeared before the Committee and denied charges under oath. From 1945 to 1951 Dr. Condon had been a member of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics. In the 1950s he developed a missile nosecone—later used by U.S. astronauts—that could withstand the high temperatures of reentry into the earth’s atmosphere. In 1954 he returned to teaching and, while on the Univ. of Colorado faculty, he undertook an Air Force study to investigate sightings of unidentified flying objects.

Instrumented aircraft overflights of Volusia County, Fla., to determine if soils could be classified by remote-sensing techniques were begun by Kennedy Space Center in cooperation with the Dept, of Agriculture. USDA was developing soil classification maps of Florida by traditional field sampling and laboratory analysis. The overflights, by icsc’s twin Beechcraft and a C-46 under contract to Johnson Space Center, would use multispectral scanning to attempt to speed the procedure, which would otherwise take 40 yrs.

Two scientists had predicted that in 1982 a rare alignment of all nine planets on the same side of the sun would produce major earthquakes, Newsweek reported. In their book The Jupiter Effect, John Cribbin of the British magazine Nature and Stephen Plagemann of Goddard Space Flight Center warned that increased solar activity caused by the alignment, which occurred every 179 yrs, would alter wind directions in the upper atmosphere. The frictional effect exerted on the solid earth by atmospheric circulation would change with the winds. The consequent braking of the earth’s rotation rate would trigger earthquakes in areas, like California, under geological stress. (Newsweek, 16 Sept 74, 57)
Marshall Space Flight Center announced the award of two contracts for studies of Skylab results. American Science and Engineering, Inc., received $2 044 860 and the Smithsonian Institution’s Astrophysical Observatory received $264 684 to study j ointly results from the Apollo Telescope Mount x-ray spectrographic telescope experiment. The telescope had been used during the three Skylab missions (25 May-22 June 1973, 28 July-25 Sept. 1973, and 16 Nov. 1973-8 Feb. 1974) to photograph x-ray producing solar events, (msfc 74-132)
Thiokol Corp. had been awarded an $8 900 000 contract for strap-on motors for the Thor-Delta launch vehicle, NASA announced. Delivery would run from May 1975 through May 1976. The contract called for 124, TX—354-5 (Castro II) rocket motors, 41 upper-burn nozzle closure plugs, and documentation for the Thor-Delta, which was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center. The Castro II strap-ons had a thrust of about 270 000 newtons (60 000 lbs). (NASA Release 74-219)
French, Canadian, and U.S. scientists were participating in projects to expand Univ. of Hawaii facilities on top of 5000-m Mauna Kea into one of the world’s greatest centers for celestial observations. In addition to NASA’s planned 3-m infrared telescope announced 4 Feb., Hawaii had recently concluded an agreement with the National Research Council of France and the National Research Council of Canada for a $20-million enterprise to operate a new 3.8-m telescope for general astronomical observations. The university already had three telescopes on Mauna Kea. (Durdin, NYT, 14 Feb 74, 33 ; NASA Release 74-23)
U.S. trunkline air traffic rose to unexpected heights, but industry officials were hesitant to interpret gains during the first quarter of 1974 as a positive trend for the year. United Air Lines, Inc., revenue-passenger-miles rose 13.6% in March over March 1973; Delta Air Lines, Inc., 10.1%; and Eastern Airlines, Inc., 7.4%. Local service carriers also reported near-record traffic improvements for March, with many showing load factors above the 55% level, rather than the normal monthly 44%. High fuel costs, however, were forcing the load-factor level required for airlines to break even to all-time highs. International operations were an exception to the general rise: Pan American World Airways, Inc., reported a revenue-passenger-mile decline of 6.1% in system-wide scheduled operations for March; Trans World Airlines, Inc., a 10.9% dip.

nasa launched three satellites—Noaa 4 (itos-g) meteorological satellite for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Intasat ionospheric satellite for Spain, and Amsat Oscar 7 amateur radio communications satellite—from Western Test Range at 9:11 am pst on one Thor-Delta launch vehicle. The three spacecraft entered almost identical, near-to-planned, polar orbits. It was the first triple launch for a Thor-Delta. Noaa 4 entered orbit with a 1458-km apogee, 1444-km perigee, 115min period, and 101.7° inclination, as the fourth operational Improved Tiros Operational Satellite in the joint NASA and Dept, of Commerce program to provide global cloud-cover observations. Delayed 29 Oct. by faulty electrical connectors on the Thor-Delta and again 13 Nov. when a 2nd-stage hydraulic pump posed a problem, the launch went smoothly on 15 Nov. Noaa 4 joined Noaa 2, launched 15 Oct. 1972, and Noaa 3, launched 6 Nov. 1973. The 345-kg, three-axis-stabilized, earth-oriented satellite moved in a circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. Day and night coverage of the earth’s cloud cover was provided by two very-high-resolution radiometer instruments and by two scanning radiometer sensors. Two vertical-temperature-profile radiometers made continuous radiance measurements for determination of the atmospheric vertical temperature profile over every part of the earth’s surface at least twice daily. One secondary sensor, the solar proton monitor, studied solar activity and its effects on the earth’s environment. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for design, development, launch, and in-orbit checkout of the spacecraft. noaa’s National Environmental Satellite Service (ness) would take over operation of the satellite after checkout. NASA mission objectives—to launch the spacecraft into sun-synchronous orbit of sufficient accuracy for operational mission requirements and to conduct an in-orbit evaluation and checkout of the spacecraft—were accomplished and the mission was adjudged successful 24 Jan. 1976. Intasat, the first Spanish satellite, separated from the Delta 2nd stage 24 min after launch and entered orbit with a 1468-km apogee and perigee, 115-min period, and 101.7° inclination. The 20-kg, 12-sided, magnetically oriented, spin-stabilized spacecraft would measure ionospheric electron content, irregularities, and scintillations in a joint space research program of NASA and the Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial. inta provided the spacecraft and would acquire experiment data. NASA provided pickaback launch and tracking. Amsat Oscar 7—the Radio Amateur Satellite Corp.’s Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio—separated from the Delta 2nd stage 77 min after liftoff and entered orbit with a 1458-km apogee, 1454-km perigee, 115-min period, and 101.7° inclination. The seventh in a series begun with Oscar 1 in 1961, the solar-powered, octahedral, 29.5-kg Oscar 7 joined Oscar 6, launched 15 Oct. 1972, to serve as a space communications relay station for radio amateurs and as a teaching aid, giving firsthand experience in space science for U.S. schools. Oscar 7 was built and prepared for launch by the Radio Amateur Satellite Corp.

NASA and the Office of Naval Research launched the world’s largest unmanned balloon from Fort Churchill, Canada, carrying a 363-kg payload to 47 000-m altitude. The experiment, designed hy Goddard Space Flight Center scientist Dr. Robert C. Hartman, measured position and electron spectra between 20 and 800 mev at the 1.2-millibar level. The helium-filled balloon, constructed of half-mil polyethylene, weighed 1360 kg and had a volume of 1.4 cu m and a 0.25-km dia. Launched and tracked with facilities of the Navy’s Skyhook program, the balloon rose over Hudson Bay and moved westward 805 km. After 18 hrs, it descended to 30 km, where the payload was separated by radio command and parachuted to the ground. (Naval Research'Reviews, Nov 74, 13) .
The Shuttle Avionic Integration Laboratory (sail) was being established at Johnson Space Center to provide a central facility for testing and evaluating avionics, flight software, flight procedures, and ground equipment for the space shuttle.

A breathing system developed by Johnson Space Center using technology for solid-propellant rocket-motor cases was being evaluated in the field by Houston firemen. New air tanks were built of spiral-wound glass fiber over an aluminum liner to provide a lighter and more durable system. (NASA Release 74-320) 10 December-16 January 1975: nasa launched West German-built Helios 1 solar probe at 2:11 am Est from Eastern Test Range on a Titan IIIE— Centaur vehicle, putting it on a path that would take it closer to the sun than any spacecraft had yet traveled. The spacecraft first entered a parking orbit and then an elliptical orbit of the sun with a 0.985-au aphelion, 0.3095-au perihelion, 190.15-day period, and 0.02° inclination to the ecliptic. All vehicle systems performed normally during launch. The Titan-Centaur carried a Delta solid-fueled rocket-motor kick stage as a 4th stage and required seven interdependent ignition systems. Following separation from the 1st stage, the Centaur, with 2300 kg of propellants remaining, began maneuvers to provide data for the 1977 Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, future synchronous orbit missions, and continued development of the launch vehicle. Maneuvers included a one-hour coast and restart, three-hour coast with thermal maneuvers, boost-pump operation experiment with igniter on, and zero-g boost-pump dead-head operation. Helios 1 was to investigate the fundamental solar processes and solar-terresfrial relations by studying the solar wind, magnetic and electric fields, cosmic rays, and cosmic dust from launch to the first perihelion, 0.31 au from the sun. The 370-kg spool-shaped spacecraft carried 10 instruments—7 West German and 3 U.S.—to measure the solar wind, magnetic field, and related shock waves; study radio waves and oscillations in the electron plasma; measure the spatial gradient of solar and galactic cosmic rays; observe composition and dynamics of interplanetary dust; and monitor x-ray activity of the solar disc. By 16 Jan. orientation and spin-rate maneuvers had been conducted and the high-gain antenna despun and pointed toward the earth. Control of the spacecraft had been passed to Germany. Instruments had been turned on and were operating normally with two exceptions: One of two antennas in the U.S. plasma-wave experiment had jammed during extension and unrolled inside the drive enclosure, producing an electrical ground and degrading all low-frequency data. Rewinding the antenna had not eliminated the ground. In addition, operation of the high-gain antenna for the West German plasma experiment produced a space . charge near the spacecraft, preventing detection of electrons with energies less than 100 ev. The medium-gain antenna would be used during selected periods. To prepare for its demanding mission, Helios 1, designed to withstand the highest temperatures ever demanded of a spacecraft, had been successfully subjected to six days at 644 K (700°F), the highest heat load expected at 0.3 au, during spring 1974 tests at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spacecraft had also withstood radiation 11 times the solar intensity at the outer edge of the earth’s atmosphere. Independent payload components, louver systems, optical surface reflectors and mirrors, and several layers of insulation dissipated spacecraft heat. In addition the spacecraft spun at one revolution per second to distribute evenly the heat coming from the sun. Temperatures within the experiment area were kept between 263 and 303 K (14° and 86°F). A second Helios spacecraft would be launched in 12 to 18 mos and information from the two spacecraft would be received simultaneously from widely differing locations, for comparison with each other and with data from Pioneer- and iMP-class spacecraft. Helios, the third cooperative U.S. and West German project, was agreed,on during 1966 talks. Following technical discussions and mission definition, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed 10 June 1969. NASA provided three scientific instruments, spacecraft technical support, launch vehicle and operations, and initial tracking and data acquisition and flight operations. The German Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (bmft) designed, built, and tested the spacecraft and provided seven scientific instruments, data acquisition and analysis, and spacecraft control. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for NASA project management; Lewis Research Center had responsibility for the launch vehicle.

Controversy over the parking position of Western Union Telegraph Co.’s second satellite—Westar-B, scheduled for June launch—was growing, the Wall Street Journal reported. Western Union had requested that the Federal Communications Commission assign the satellite a 119° west longitude position, but American Telephone & Telegraph Co. had petitioned the FCC to deny the request. AT&T would like to use that position for one of three comsats it planned to have in operation by early 1976. Positions were limited; communications satellites occupied orbits 35 500-35 900 km above the equator, and positions between 119° and 138° west longitude served the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Alaska best. In addition, comsats had to be spaced about 5° apart to avoid interference with each other. (Jacobs, WSJ, 2 May 74)

U.S. District Court Judge Joseph C. Waddy denied a request by the American Federation of Government Employees for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked NASA plans to lay off or reduce in grade 657 employees at Marshall Space Flight Center. The denial followed a 30 May temporary restraining order issued by Judge Waddy in response to an amendment to a 1967 suit filed by the AFGE against NASA and the Civil Service Commission. The suit challenged NASA’s alleged hiring of private contractors for vacated civil service jobs. In a November 1973 decision, the Federal District Court judge had ordered esc to review contract jobs at msfc to determine whether they met standards set forth in the Pellerzi rule, which guided CSC in evaluating contracts for personal services, (nasa Off Gen Counsel, interview, 23 Jan 76; Casebolt, Huntsville Times, 31 May 74; Cramer, W Star-News, 1 June 74) .

Inflation would force even more extensive cuts in NASA operations if funding did not increase in the next few fiscal years, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported in a survey of nasa belt-tightening. The magazine quoted nasa Comptroller William E. Lilly as saying cost contracts for major spacecraft programs had a 9-12% inflation rate. The overall effective impact of inflation was 7—7.5% at NASA, but these averages were much lower than for many specific areas. Although materials increases were averaging 15-20%, particular increases ranged from 0-100%. The 7% inflation rate in Center supplies was being absorbed by using inventories and by decreasing the use of supplies. Utility cost increases of 20-30% at NASA Centers had been countered by lower use— a 30% cut—but Centers were still paying 10-15% more. Overall wage rates could increase 20-30% over the next three years, Lilly had said, because of a trend-setting agreement between the Boeing Co. and the International Assn, of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Support service contracts were showing a 7-9% yearly inflationary increase. NASA Centers were seeking new solutions. At Goddard Space Flight Center, more fixed-price contracts were being issued, but predicting economic changes was problematic, according to William R. Mecca, gsfc Deputy Director for Administration and Management, gsfc had begun limiting data acquisition from spacecraft and drawing up contingency plans for many unmanned programs—like the International Sun-Earth Explorer Spacecraft program and the International Ultraviolet Explorer program—to save costs if primary plans began to exceed spending limits. Marshall Space Flight Center had reduced its work force by 850— about 15%—since June 1973 and had closed 47 structures. Lewis Research Center had cut its power needs 7%, using a transient data-record-ing system to reduce operating hours. Johnson Space Center, along with others, had been hiring young persons rather than high-salaried experienced persons. JSC electric costs were still increasing even though the Center had reduced its exterior lighting by 75% and its interior lighting by 33%. Kennedy Space Center was phasing construction for shuttle and other programs, outfitting facilities to meet minimum initial operational requirements rather than for long-range mission models. Consideration was being given to advance procurement for lower costs and for preventing slowdowns from shortages. (Covault, Av Wk, 2 Dec 74, 38-42; Lilly, interview, 19 Sept 75)

President Nixon issued Executive Order 11760 designating the European Space Research Organization (esro) a public international organization entitled to. privileges, exemptions, and immunities provided for by the International Organizations Immunities Act. (PD, 21 Jan 74, 40) On 23 Jan. the satellite was found by the Air Force Satellite Control Facility and attempts were made 24 Jan. to raise the orbit by firing the spacecraft’s onboard thrusters. Although the firing was succcessful, the orbital attitude was not raised enough to extend the life of the satellite. Skynet IIA reentered the earth’s atmosphere and burned up 25 Jan, over the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The Skynet II communications satellite program was being carried out under a U.K.-U.S. agreement signed 1 April 1970 and a usaf-nasa agreement 1 May 1972 to provide the U.K. in-orbit, X-band military communications between designated earth stations and replace Skynet A and B, launched by NASA 21 Nov. 1969 and 18 Aug. 1970. nasa responsibilities included integration of the U.K.-built spacecraft with the launch vehicle and provision of the vehicle and related services including network tracking communications and telemetry during ascent and transfer orbit phase. Another Skynet II satellite was to be launched in the fall. (nasa mors, 8 Jan 74, 4 Sept 74; AP, NYT, 30 Jan 74; AP, W Star-News, 19 Jan 74, A4)
The YF-17 prototype lightweight fighter aircraft was rolled out at the Northrop Corp. plant in Hawthorne, Calif. The YF—17 and the YF-16 being built by General Dynamics Corp. marked the first Air Force effort to place more emphasis on hardware performance and less on paper studies by using an advance prototyping concept. The usaf would evaluate the YF—16 and YF-17 in a 12-mo flight-test program before making a commitment to production, (dod Release 131-74)
A shortage of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (udmh) rocket fuel was being strictly managed to prevent delays in military and NASA launches. The fuel was produced from raw materials found to have an agent that could cause cancer in humans. Methods had been devised to produce the fuel by removing humans from the step endangering health, but adequate supplies could not be produced before the end of the year. Stopgap measures taken by the Air Force, including strict control and allocation of existing supplies, was preventing the shortage from interfering with any critical launches, (nasa Dir Launch Vehicle & Propulsion Prog, interview, 2 Oct 75; Av Wk, 11 Nov 74,14)

Marshall Space Flight Center awarded more than $28.2 million in contracts of $25 000 or more. Among awards were $2 253 300 to Inscho’s Mechanical Contractors, Inc., for construction of the X-Ray Telescope Facility at msfc ; also $695 000 to Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and $687 201 to Martin Marietta Corp., for Large Space Telescope support system module studies, (msfc Release 75-18) 1974 in Summary The U.S. orbited 28 payloads in 22 launches during the year. The U.S.S.R. orbited 95 payloads in 81 launches; Italy launched 2 payloads, using NASA launch vehicles; and Japan launched 1. U.S. launches included 16 payloads in 14 NASA launches and 12 spacecraft in 8 Dept, of Defense launches. For the first year since 1967 the U.S. launched no men into space, although Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue completed the longest mission yet accomplished by man when they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean 8 Feh. after 84 days in space. The U.S.S.R. orbited three two-man crews during the year, including two crews to dock with the Salyut 3 space station. The Soyuz 14 crew docked and worked aboard the laboratory for nearly 16 days, but Soyuz 15 failed to dock and it returned to earth after 48 hrs in space. Soyuz 16 tested the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project configuration in December. The U.S.S.R. also launched the Salyut 4 orbiting space station, to be joined by a two-man crew in January 1975. The 16 NASA-launched payloads—li paid for by domestic and foreign corporations or foreign governments—included 7 communications, 1 applications technology, 2 meteorological, and 6 scientific satellites. These were in addition to 2 Italian-launched cooperative scientific satellites. Comsats included two spacecraft launched for United Kingdom military communications ■—Skynet IIA into too low an orbit, followed later by the successful Skynet IIB, Westar 1 and 2, launched for Western Union Telegraph Co., were the first U.S. commercial domestic communications satellites. The most complex and versatile of the Applications Technology Satellites, Ats 6, went into orbit in May. The spacecraft was transmitting medical and educational telecommunications to small inexpensive ground stations in remote areas of the U.S. and would, in 1975, he positioned to broadcast educational programs to 5000 villages in India. Symphonie 1 was launched for France and West Germany as the first of two experimental communications satellites. Intelsat-lV F-8 was launched for Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, and Amsat Oscar 7 for Radio Amateur Satellite Corp. as a secondary payload on the Noaa 4 launch. The two meteorological satellites included Synchronous Meteorological Satellite Sms 1, launched for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to provide continuous day and night images of cloud cover over the U.S. and Atlantic Ocean for the first time. Sms 1 was the first meteorological satellite in synchronous orbit. Noaa 4 was launched as part of noaa’s global weather watch program. All but one of NASA’s six scientific payloads were cooperative efforts with foreign countries. Miranda (UK-X4) was launched for U.K. to measure the density of sun-reflecting particles near the spacecraft as well as test spacecraft systems. Spain’s first satellite—Intasat, put into polar orbit as a secondary payload with Noaa 4—began studies of the ionosphere. Two spacecraft were launched in cooperation with West Germany: Aeros 2 to measure aeronomic parameters of the upper atmosphere and solar ultraviolet radiation, Helios 1 into solar orbit to investigate interstellar space closer to the sun than any previous spacecraft had and to gather extensive new data on the sun. NASA and The Netherlands joined to orbit The Netherlands Astronomical Satellite Ans 1 to study stellar uv and x-ray sources. NASA’s only all-U.S. scientific payload, Hawkeye 1 (Explorer 52), was launched into polar orbit to study plasma properties of the magnetosphere over the north polar cap. A Titan-Centaur proof-flight vehicle carrying a Viking spacecraft model and a sphinx satellite failed to achieve orbit and was destroyed during launch operations. The new NASA launch vehicle later successfully launched Helios 1. Italian launch crews, using NASA launch vehicles, launched two satellites into earth orbit from the San Marco launch platform in the Indian Ocean off the East African coast. San Marco 4 in February carried two U.S. and one Italian experiment into orbit to measure diurnal variations in the equatorial neutral atmosphere. Ariel 5 was launched in October for U.K., to study galactic and extragalactic x-ray sources, in the first Italian launch for a country other than the U.S. or Italy. Japan launched its fifth satellite, Tansei 2—Japan’s first on a guided booster. In addition to the three manned Soyuz missions^ the U.S.S.R. launched 2 Salyut space stations; 3 unmanned Soyuz spacecraft identified as Cosmos 638, 656, and 672 ; 7 Molniya comsats; 5 Meteor meteorological satellites; 2 cooperative Intercosmos; 2 Luna lunar probes; and 71 spacecraft under the Cosmos designation. Space Science and Exploration Besides the new scientific satellites, NASA continued systematic exploration of the solar system as Pioneer 11, launched in April 1973, sped to within 42 000 km of Jupiter 3 Dec. The spacecraft photographed the giant planet and its moons, transmitting new information on the planet’s weather patterns, atmosphere, and radiation belts. Data from Pioneer 11 and its predecessor Pioneer 10, which had encountered Jupiter in December 1973 revealed that Jupiter was hotter than previously estimated and composed largely of liquid hydrogen. Cyclones and anticyclones stretched completely around the planet with rising grey-white cloud ridges extending 20 km above Jupiter’s distinctive orange-brown belts. Jupiter’s great red spot was probably the vortex of a great storm that had- raged along a 400 000-km front for centuries. At year’s end Pioneer 11 was speeding toward rendezvous with Saturn to give man his closest look at that planet while Pioneer 10 raced to cross the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto and become the first spacecraft to leave the solar system. Meanwhile Mariner 10—after passing within 5800 km of Venus and sending back new information on particle environment, mass, and density of that planet—made two successful flybys of Mercury in March and September. The spacecraft transmitted data that gave scientists mass measurements 100 times better than previous ones, described a detached, well-defined bow shock wave, and showed temperatures varying from 90 K on the night side to 700 K on the day side ( — 300°F to 800°F). During the two encounters the spacecraft photographed 45% of the planet’s surface. By the end of the year Mariner 10 was headed for a third Mercury encounter in March 1975. Preparations for the two 1975 Viking missions to Mars continued with the qualification-testing of Viking science instruments, engineering subsysterns, and entire orbiter and lander spacecraft. During the last quarter of the year the lander successfully completed critical surface simulation tests that included subjecting the spacecraft to temperatures approximating Martian conditions and dropping it from 0.6 m to determine the effects of landing shocks on the integrated Viking equipment. A detailed spacecraft design for the 1977 Mariner mission to Jupiter and Saturn was completed while a major effort to find a satisfactory way to protect the spacecraft from Jupiter’s strong radiation continued. A major new space science start, approved in nasa’s FY 1975 budget, was the 1978 dual Pioneer-Venus mission to obtain detailed measurements of the Venus atmosphere with an orbiter and four atmospheric entry probes. Hughes Aircraft Co. was chosen in February for spacecraft design, with an option for spacecraft development, and experimenters and scientific instrumentation were selected in June. NASA continued preparations to place the Large Space Telescope in earth orbit to make detailed astronomical observations 10 times deeper into space than possible before. During 1974, preliminary system definitions and advanced technological development were carried out on selected elements of the LST. Besides preparing for future missions, scientists continued analysis of data accumulated from previous missions. A Lunar Data Analysis and Synthesis program began to correlate existing data and data still being collected by the five Apollo lunar surface-experiment packages (alsep) left on the moon during the lunar landing program. With the conclusion of the Skylab flight program, large volumes of new data on the sun and the earth and the most comprehensive inflight data yet on man’s adaptation to space flight became available. During the year sounding rockets, balloons, telescopes, and instrumented aircraft continued to increase knowledge of the universe. NASA launched nearly 80 sounding rockets from sites around the world. A significant accomplishment was the launch of 54 sounding rockets within 24 hrs to support the Joint NASA-Air Force Atmospheric Layering and Density Distribution of Ions and Neutrals (aladdin) program. During 1974 scientists in programs outside NASA as well as in, using data from both orbital and suborbital programs, discovered a 13th moon of Jupiter, observed a pulsar that was a member of a double star system, obtained new data on the size and shape of the Crab Nebula, discovered a galaxy six times larger than any previously known in the universe, and made the greatest advance yet in cometary research with the study of the Comet Kohoutek, including first-time identification of water molecules in a comet. The U.S.S.R. continued a program of space exploration with the launch of lunar probes Luna 22 in May and Luna 23 in October. Luna 22 studied the lunar surface and atmosphere from lunar orbit. Luna 23 was damaged while landing on the moon’s surface and its work was discontinued after three days of equipment testing. Space Transportation and Technology The space shuttle program accelerated, with funding increasing from $475 million in FY 1974 to $800 million in FY 1975. But this total reflected an $89-million cut by the Office of Management and Budget from planned space shuttle funding, delaying the program four to six months. The final maj or contract was awarded and design work neared completion; by year’s end the program moved into hardware test and fabrication stages. Construction of the shuttle runway at Kennedy Space Center began in April and throughout the year contracts were awarded for additional space shuttle facilities. The European Space Research Organization selected VFW-Fokker/ ehno Raumfahrttechnik GmbH as prime contractor to design and build Spacelab for missions on the shuttle. Primary efforts were directed toward planning early shuttle missions and making analyses for a NASA mission model. In solid propulsion technology, the final motor—the first with a restart capability—in a series of high-efficiency solid-fueled motors was successfully static-fired. The October firing marked the first time a spacecraft solid-fueled motor had been fired, quenched, reignited, and requenched. Another significant step was the static-firing of a thermally sterilized solid-fueled motor. Electric propulsion—attractive as auxiliary propulsion for long-life station-keeping and attitude control—took a stride forward with the tests of a 4.5-millinewton (0.001-lb-thrust) ion engine aboard Ats 6. In spacecraft energy system technology, solar cells were made from a silicon ribbon grown directly from the liquid state, a critical first step in low-cost manufacture of solar cells. Other advances were made in laser, nuclear, atmosphere-entry, material-and-structures, guidance, and control-and-information technology. The X—24B lifting body completed 15 flights in the NASA and Air Force program to develop a safe piloted vehicle for reentry from space flight and to develop hypersonic technology. Following the first supersonic flight in March, the vehicle’s performance and handling qualities were evaluated in the speed range between mach 1.6 and landing. NASA’s aeronautics research and development program to reduce fuel consumption, reduce undesirable environmental effects, improve safety, and advance technology continued during the year. Flight tests of an F—111 equipped with the NASA-developed supercritical wing demonstrated a 15% reduction in fuel consumption. Other tests using flexible aircraft skin concepts, composite materials, active-control technology, and alternative fuels also demonstrated reduced drag and potential fuel savings. In NASA’s refan program—an effort to reduce noise of the JT8D engine that powered most of the Nation’s narrow-body commercial fleet—three refanned engines demonstrated in ground tests that the ground area affected by objectionable noise from commercial aircraft could be reduced by 75%. In another technique, a DC-8 using a NASA-developed two-segment landing approach reduced the ground area affected by excessive noise 53%. Efforts to measure and reduce aircraft engine exhaust in the atmosphere continued with the Global Air Sampling Program. A United Air Lines, Inc., Boeing 747 equipped with an atmospheric sampling instrument began measuring aircraft pollution on commercial air routes, while the clean combuster technology program was expanded to reduce engine emissions. Programs to improve aircraft safety continued to make progress. Techniques to reduce hazardous trailing vortices were flight-tested. A NASA-developed prototype system to track aircraft wakes near airports, allowing traffic controllers to adjust aircraft spacing more closely, was being operationally evaluated at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City. The Dept. ,of Defense A-10 close-air-support program moved into production stage, with the first of six aircraft in final assembly and checkout. Production of an initial increment of 22 aircraft was approved in December, with a full production decision expected late in 1975. dod’s B-l advanced strategic bomber moved through engine preliminary flight-readiness tests in April, rollout in October, and first flight in December. Following flight testing, a production decision would be made in 1976. The first operational F—15 advanced tactical fighter was delivered in November. At year’s end 20 test aircraft had accumulated more than 300 flight hrs. International Cooperation Aerospace activities continued to become more international. Of the 16 NASA-launched payloads, 10 were cooperative efforts with foreign organizations. In addition, the 2 Italian-launched payloads carried U.S. experiments. During the year negotiations were completed on an agreement for NASA to furnish reimbursable launches for three future synchronous-orbit Japanese satellites, nasa-esro Spacelab working groups met throughout the year on experimental objectives and user requirements. Investigators from 42 countries and 5 international organizations were selected for Earth Resources Technology Satellite follow-on investigations, and Italy and Iran signed agreements with NASA to build earth stations to receive ERTS data directly. The 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project neared flight readiness. Joint compatibility tests of communications and docking systems were carried out and intensive joint flight-crew and flight-controller training was begun. Apollo hardware was completed. The U.S.S.R launched two unmanned and one manned Soyuz spacecraft (Cosmos 638 and 672 and Soyuz 16) to check out new systems and equipment for the joint mission. NASA and the Soviet Academy of Sciences approved public information plans and plans for prelaunch testing at the U.S. and U.S.S.R. launch sites. U.S. and Soviet specialists exchanged information about the moon, planets, environmental problems, and biomedical results from U.S. and U.S.S.R. space flights. U.S. and Soviet scientists preparing a joint experiment using Ats 6 data met in the U.S. in October for technical coordination. And plans were formulated in October for a U.S. life science experiment to fly on the next available Soviet biological satellite. For 101 days, June-September, the U.S. and 69 other countries participating in the Global Atmospheric Research Program’s Atlantic Tropical Experiment monitored nearly every known meteorological factor along a 52-million-sq-km tropical area of land and sea from the eastern Pacific Ocean across Latin America, the Atlantic Ocean, and Africa to the western Indian Ocean. More than 4000 persons using 41 ships, 40 instrumented buoys, 12 aircraft, and 6 satellites probed from 1.6 km below the sea surface to the top of the atmosphere to improve weather predictions, assess pollution, determine the feasibility of large-scale weather modification, and establish new bonds of international cooperation. " Applications and Energy During 1974 space technology continued to make significant contributions to the quality of life. In addition to 1974-launched Ats 6, Sms 1, Westar 1 and 2, Intelstat-lV F-8, and Noaa 4 to improve weather predictions and communications on the earth—Erts 1, launched in July 1972, completed 29 mos in operation. Erts 1 had transmitted more than 100 000 photos covering three fourths of the world’s land masses and coastal areas, erts data—used to monitor urban and agricultural development, locate air and water pollution, update maps, and find new water and mineral resources—had been provided to more than 300 U.S. and foreign investigators in government, universities, and industry, erts—b development continued on schedule. NASA’s pollution monitoring program—to develop and demonstrate technology to monitor atmospheric and water pollution—completed its second year. Procurement for design and construction of the Nimbus-G Oceanographic and Air Pollution Observing Satellite, planned for 1978 launch, was under way. The Lower Atmospheric Composition and Temperature Experiment (lacate) was demonstrated in May and a test in the advanced applications flight experiment program-—using balloons, sounding rockets, and aircraft as well as ground-based experiments—successfully gathered atmospheric data over a five-hour period. dod expanded and improved its Defense Satellite Communications System and let contracts for Phase 1 navstar global positioning satellites. The Defense Meteorological Satellite program continued to furnish weather data for military and civilian use. Space technology continued to be applied to medicine. A digital computing cardiotachometer to monitor heart rates, an automated blood pressure monitoring system, and a new method of attaching artificial limbs were among the NASA-developed contributions demonstrated in 1974. An Office of Energy Programs was established in NASA to focus the application of its aerospace technology to energy needs. In addition to programs to reduce aircraft air pollution and energy consumption and develop new fuels, NASA, under the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974 and in cooperation with the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development and other Federal agencies, was investigating the use of solar energy for heating and cooling buildings. An experimental solar house at Marshall Space Flight Center would ultimately derive up to 85% of its heating and cooling energy from the sun. Solar heating and cooling were being demonstrated in school. NASA continued research on wind energy systems, with the construction of a 100-kw wind-powered generator at Lewis Research Center; low-pollution, low-fuel-consumption automotive engines; aerodynamically designed vehicles to increase fuel economy; energy conversion systems. NASA distributed some 300 new Tech Briefs and 30 special compilations of new technology items to 15 000 subscribers in business and industry. Use of Regional Dissemination Centers for space technology applicable to other uses increased 34%, to 4000 clients. Tracking and Data Acquisition The Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (stdn) supported some 40 flight projects during 1974, including all NASA’s earth-orbital missions as well as space projects of foreign governments and private industry. Congress authorized funds for procurement activities for a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss)—two earth-orbiting satellites leased by NASA to relay data between low-altitude spacecraft and a single ground station. The authority to proceed further was subject to additional congressional review of a NASA-owned versus a leased system. (Pres Rpt 74; NASA Release 74r-330; NASA Activities, 15 Dec 74; A&A 74)

(Transcript; O’Toole, W Post, 20 Nov 74, A3) 22 November-6 January 1975: NASA launched Skynet IIB, a U.K. military communications satellite, for the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Office as agents for the U.K. Ministry of Defense. The satellite was launched on a three-stage Thor-Delta launch vehicle from Eastern Test Range at 7:28 pm est into an orbit with a 36 965-km apogee, 185km perigee, and 24.6° inclination. The apogee kick motor, fired at 8:10 pm est on 24 Nov., circularized the orbit with an apogee of 36 595 km, perigee of 35 896 km, period of 24 hrs 19.4 min, and inclination of 2.2°. The spacecraft then drifted to its geosynchronous station at 50° E longitude over the Indian Ocean. NASA adjudged the launch a success 6 Jan. 1975. The first-generation Skynet A and B had been developed for the U.K. in the usaf’s Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program (idcsp) and launched by NASA 21 Nov. 1969 and 18 Aug. 1970. Skynet IIA failed to achieve a satisfactory orbit when launched 18 Jan. 1974 and reentered 25 Jan. The launch of Skynet I IB had been delayed from 19 Nov. by a defective component in the Delta 2nd-stage attitude control system.

Data from U.S.S.R. space probes Mars 4, 6, and 7 [see 9-12 March] had indicated that several “tens percent” of the Martian atmosphere was made up of an inert gas, probably argon, Tass quoted Prof. Vasily I. Moroz as reporting in Izvestiya. The data would substantiate Soviet scientists’ belief that several million or even several hundred thousand years ago Mars had an atmosphere with a density close to that of the earth. In addition, data from Mariner 9 (launched 30 May 1971) and Mars 5 had shown that the planet had had surface water and might “acquire it again, for such changes take place during the planet’s geological history . . . with a definite periodicity.” New data was increasing hope of finding the simplest biosphere. “In any case, in the not so distant geological past Mars apparently had . . . die conditions necessary for the emergence of life. The reappearance of such periods in the future is not ruled out.” The Western press later quoted U.S. scientists as saying that the presence of large amounts of argon would have “dramatic implications” and would tend to support the theory that the Martian climate had been going through a series of cycles during which ice ages alternated with warmer and wetter conditions. But Dr. Carl E. Sagan of Cornell Univ. said during a telephone interview that the 90% content of carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere had been well established, so that “at most 10% of argon was barely possible.” (fbis-Sov, 26 March 74, U1; Shabad, NYT, 7 April 74,34)
Preliminary studies of the use of laser beams to monitor water temperature, turbidity, salinity, and other factors affecting quality were under way at the University of Miami under Kennedy Space Center contract.

American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and GTE Satellite Corp. filed a proposal with the Federal Communications Commission to operate a joint domestic satellite system. The system would serve the contiguous 48 states and Hawaii and could serve Alaska and Puerto Rico through earth stations owned by other companies. A joint system would improve network efficiency and reduce the number of earth stations to 7, from the 10 required for two separate systems. Three satellites operated by comsat General Corp. and provided to AT&T would serve the joint system and could handle 28 800 simultaneous telephone conversations. The FCC had approved separate domestic satellite systems for the two companies 12 Sept. 1973, directing them to work together to integrate the systems and negotiate agreements for handling communications traffic and equitable division of revenues from jointly rendered services.

Bobko—took part in training in Star City, near Moscow, for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. A ninth, Eugene A. Cernan, took part in the first two weeks of training, representing the Johnson Space Center Apollo Spacecraft Program Office. In addition to studying Soyuz spacecraft systems, the astronauts trained with the Soviet flight crews in simulators and mockups. They also continued planning procedures and checklists for the joint mission, (jsc Release 74-121; JSC Roundup, 30 Aug 74) 25 June-19 July: The Salyut 3 research station and—nine days later—the Soyuz 14 spacecraft carrying a two-man crew were launched into nearearth orbit to establish a U.S.S.R. manned orbital workshop. Salyut 3 was launched at 4:55 am local time 25 June (7:55 pm EOT 24 June) from Baykonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam into orbit with 252-km apogee, 213-km perigee, 89.2-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass announced the purpose of the mission was to improve the station’s design, onboard systems, and equipment and to perform scientific research during space flight. By 30 June Salyut 3, which consisted of two cylinders more than 21 m in length and weighing some 18 500 kg, had been raised to a near-circular orbit with a 268-km apogee and 265-km perigee. Soyuz 14 was launched 3 July at 11:51 pm local time (2:51 pm EDT) from Baykonur Cosmodrome carrying Cosmonauts Pavel R. Popovich, commander and veteran of the 12 Aug. 1962 Vostok 4 mission, and Yuri P. Artyukhin, flight engineer, to rendezvous with Salyut 3. The launch was seen by Soviet citizens by delayed broadcast on Moscow TV. The spacecraft entered orbit with a 338-km apogee, 201-km perigee, 89.9min period, and 51.5° inclination. Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training, said during a 4 July Tass interview that the main objectives of the mission were “testing methods and systems of controlling the craft, improvement in the life-sustaining complex, [and] exploration of new possibilities of using both separate craft and groups of space objects to accomplish scientific and applied tasks in a nearearth orbit.” Tass also reported that a 4 July trajectory correction placed the spacecraft in an orbit with a 277-km apogee, 255-km perigee, 89.7min period, and 51.6° inclination. All spacecraft systems were successfully checked out and the crew was reported to be in good health. The Soyuz 14 cosmonauts rendezvoused and docked with Scdyut 3 on 5 July during their 17th orbit, successfully demonstrating techniques the Soviets would use during the July 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project maneuvers. After docking, Popovich and Artyukhin checked the station’s onboard systems and microclimate and entered the 99-cu-m three-room laboratory. During their 15-day mission the cosmonauts studied geological-morphological objects on the earth’s surface, atmospheric formations and phenomena, physical characteristics of outer space, and manufacturing techniques, as well as testing the Salyut space station’s improved design and solar-panel energy system. The crew also studied the influences of space on the human organism and exercised to prevent loss of muscle tone, using an onboard comprehensive trainer to simulate running, jumping, and weight lifting. . Tass reported 15 July that some Soviet scientists considered terminating the mission because unexpected, intense solar flares 4-8 July dramatically increased the radiation exposure. However, because the flares subsided and the space station’s orbit prevented excessive exposure, the crew’s work was not disrupted. While the cosmonauts worked in space, two Soviet researchers lived in a duplicate station on the ground, simultaneously performing the same work. All commands relayed to the orbiting Salyut 3 were first checked on the ground and alternate versions of decisions for unforeseen situations were calculated. On 8 July the U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project crew, in training at Star City for the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. mission in 1975, telegraphed congratulations to the Salyut 3 cosmonauts on their “great success.” They said they looked forward to meeting the two after their “happy return.” By 18 July the crew completed most experiments and began transferring equipment to Soyuz 14. After checking out spacecraft systems, the cosmonauts undocked 19 July. Retrorockets were fired, parachutes deployed, and Soyuz 14 softlanded at 5:21 pm Baykonur time (8:21 am edt) 140 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan 2000 m from the planned target after 15 days 17 hours 30 min in space. The crew left the spacecraft unaided, and on-the-spot medical checks showed the cosmonauts’ health was “good.” All mission tests were reported completed. For the first time, a U.S.S.R. orbital mission had been in touch with mission control continuously because of maritime tracking. Salyut 3 was the third space station orbited by the U.S.S.R. Salyut 1 had been launched 19 April 1971. A three-man crew on Soyuz 10 docked with the station 24 April but returned to earth without entering. A second crew, launched 6 June 1971 aboard Soyuz 11, entered the orbiting station and conducted scientific experiments for 24 days. The three died during reentry when an open valve evacuated air from the spacecraft. Salyut 2 was launched into orbit 3 April 1973 but apparently an explosion or wildly firing thrusters sent the station out of control, tearing off the solar panels and making the station uninhabitable, (gsfc Wkly SSR, 20-26 June, 3—10 July 74; gsfc SSR, 30 June, 31 Aug 74; Tass, FBis-Sov, 25 June-23 July 74; UPl, W Star-News, 14 July 74; Browne, NYT, 9, 20 July 74; SBD, 9, 27 July 74; A&A 1973)

Magnetic domain bubbles” being tested as computer memory devices could do mass memory jobs faster, cheaper, and more reliably than conventional devices and could store information for many years for long space journeys, the Air Force Systems Command reported. Dr. Millar Mier of AFSC believed the minute bubbles—densely packed in very thin, magnetic garnet material—would replace tape recorders and computer disc and drum memories in aircraft and spacecraft within a few years. The solid-state bubble bits of information were resistant to radiation and would remain stable during vehicle reentry into the atmosphere or operation in the Van Allen belts. A 10 000-bit test module delivered to the Air Force Avionics Laboratory in May was undergoing tests. (AFSC Release oip 138.74)

Methods developed to analyze images of the earth taken by the Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched 23 July 1972) had been adapted to enhance x-rays for medical use, NASA announced. The new technique, developed by a NASA cooperative student at Kennedy Space Center, included a microdensitometer that scanned the film and separated the grey shades into various densities. The untrained eye could detect 8 to 10 shades and the trained eye 32, but the microdensitometer could pick out 256 shades. Breaking down the image into more grey levels showed detail not perceived by the human eye. (ksc Release 81-74) - _
