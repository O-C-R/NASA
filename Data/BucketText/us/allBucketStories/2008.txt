NASA announced that the International Mineralogical Association had confirmed the identification of a new mineral—manganese silicide—that scientists believed had originated in a comet. Keiko Nakamura-Messenger of NASA’s JSC had led the research, with contributions from scientists in Germany, Japan, and the United States. The researchers had named the mineral “Brownleeite,” in honor of University of Washington professor Donald E. Brownlee, who had originated the study of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). Scientists examine IDPs because these tiny grains of space sand are composed of the original building blocks of the solar system. NASA had found the Brownleeite on an IDP collected in 2003 by an ER-2 high-altitude aircraft flown out of NASA’s DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base. The aircraft had collected dust from the stream of the comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup. NASA’s JSC had analyzed the tiny IDP, which measured only 0.0001 inches (0.000254 centimeters), using a transmission electron microscope.(NASA, “NASA Finds New Type of Comet Dust Mineral,” news release 08-143, 12 June 2008, http://www.nasa. gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08143_comet_dust.html (accessed 21 April 2011).)
At a ceremony during the opening of the Spirit of Innovation exhibition at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, NASA recognized the first winners of the Pete Conrad Spirit of Innovation Award, a national competition that challenges high school students to create concepts that advance the personal spaceflight industry. NASA’s Innovative Partnership Program sponsored the US$10,000 prize for the Conrad Award. The Spirit of Innovation exhibition would travel nationwide to highlight the students’ achievements. The X Prize Foundation announced that, in addition, a scroll inscribed with the winners’ names would travel to the ISS. Michael Hakimi and Talia Nour-Omid had won the Conrad award in October 2007 for the innovation of a device that could effectively monitor all of an astronaut’s vital signs.(Aero-News Network, “NASA, X Prize Foundation Recognize 2007 Pete Conrad Award Winners,” 22 January 2008, http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?ContentBlockID=c8a0d40b-5081-43b6-afcd-f2b876e7408b (accessed 16 December 2010); NASA, “NASA and X Prize Foundation To Recognize Conrad Award Winners,” news release M08-010, 16 January 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jan/HQ_M08010_Xprize_HQ_M08010_ Xprize_HQ_M08010_Xprize_Conrad_Award.html (accessed 16 December 2008).)
NASA announced the resignation of Robert P. Hopkins as NASA’s Chief of Strategic Communications. Hopkins had held positions at NASA as Senior Advisor to Deputy Administrator Shana L. Dale and as Assistant Administrator of the Office of Communications Planning. Over the course of his career, he had managed the development of a strategic communications plan that had served as the basis for NASA activities, such as planning NASA’s fiftieth anniversary in 2008. Additionally, Hopkins had enacted initiatives, such as a communications portal and a toolkit for implementing the Communications Coordinating Committee, helping to facilitate communication across NASA. He had advanced NASA’s outreach through development programs, such as the NASA Future Forums and the NASA Lecture Series. Upon leaving NASA, Hopkins planned to take a position in the private sector. NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin named Christopher M. Shank as Acting Chief of Strategic Communications. Shank had joined NASA in 2005, after holding positions in the U.S. Air Force, in the NRO, and, as a staff member on the U.S. House Science and Technology
The “Mystery Team”—the fifth team to register for the Google Lunar X Prize the team that chose not to reveal its identity—announced its name at a press conference at NASA’s ARC: Next Giant Leap. Michael Joyce led Next Giant Leap, an American team comprising members from Aurora Flight Sciences, which specializes in aerial vehicles and space hardware; Busek, which would supply the propulsion system; Draper Laboratory, which would supply the landing technology; and MicroSat Systems, which would be the lead systems integrator.

A Russian Soyuz rocket lifted off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 07:01 (UT), ferrying an American space tourist and two Expedition 18 crew members to the ISS. Tourist Richard A. Garriott was the son of former astronaut Owen K. Garriott, who had been a crew member of Skylab 3 in 1973. Garriott had reached a commercial agreement with the Russian federal space agency Roscosmos to spend nine days aboard the ISS and to return to Earth with the Expedition 17 crew on 23 October 2008. The Expedition 18 crew, consisting of Commander E. Michael Fincke of NASA and Russian cosmonaut Yuri V. Lonchakov, would replace two members of the Expedition 17 crew, Russian cosmonauts Sergei A. Volkov and Oleg D. Kononenko. The third crew member, Russian cosmonaut Gregory E. Chamitoff, had arrived at the ISS in June 2008 and planned to stay until November 2008. The main goal of Expedition 17 was to prepare the ISS to accommodate six crew members on long-duration missions.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 660, 1 November 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx660.html (accessed 4 August 2011); NASA, “New Crew Blasts Off for International Space Station,” news release 08-257, 12 October 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/oct/HQ_08-257_X18_Launch.html (accessed 8 August 2011).)
A Russian Soyuz spacecraft landed in Kazakhstan at 10:37 p.m. (CDT), returning space tourist Richard A. Garriott and cosmonauts Sergei A. Volkov and Oleg D. Kononenko from the ISS. Garriott, who had been the sixth tourist to visit the ISS, had lifted off for the ISS with two American astronauts on 12 October 2008. Commander Volkov and Flight Engineer Kononenko had served 197 days aboard the ISS on the Expedition 17 mission, performing two spacewalks. During their mission, NASA’s Space Shuttle had visited the ISS to deliver a Japanese laboratory. The Expedition 18 crew, American Commander E. Michael Fincke and Russian Flight Engineer Yuri V. Lonchakov, had replaced Volkov and Kononenko on the ISS.(Tariq Malik, “New Space Station Crew Takes Charge,” Space.com, 22 October 2008, http://www.space.com/ 6011-space-station-crew-takes-charge.html (accessed 11 August 2011); NASA, “Expedition 17 Crew Returns from International Space Station,” news release 08-269, 23 October 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/oct/ HQ_08-269_Expedition_17_landing.html (accessed 8 August 2011).)
Space Shuttle Discovery launched from NASA’s KSC at 21:02 (UT), commencing Mission STS- 124 to the ISS. During liftoff, observers noticed pieces of insulating foam falling from Discovery’s external fuel tank; however, NASA officials stated that they were not worried about the foam, since it had fallen after the time when it could have damaged the spacecraft. Seven crew members were aboard the Space Shuttle, including American astronauts, Commander Mark E. Kelly, Pilot Kenneth T. Ham, Gregory E. Chamitoff, Michael E. Fossum, Ronald J. Garan Jr., and Karen L. Nyberg, and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide. During the mission, the astronauts planned to repair a broken toilet on the ISS and to install on the Japanese Kibo laboratory a new, 16-tonne (16,000-kilogram or 35,273-pound) room, known as the Japanese Pressurized Module (JPM). The astronauts planned three spacewalks. In addition to installing the JPM, they intended to clean a damaged power-supply rotary joint and to perform routine maintenance. NASA planned for the mission to last for 14 days. Garrett E. Reisman, who had been aboard the ISS since March 2008, would return to Earth with the STS-124 crew, and Chamitoff would remain aboard the ISS in his place.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 655; NASA, “NASA’s Shuttle Discovery Launches with Japanese Laboratory,” news release 08-136, 31 May 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_08136_STS-124_launch_release. html (accessed 16 March 2011); John Schwartz, “Shuttle Discovery Heads Toward the Space Station,” New York Times, 1 June 2008.)
NASA announced that Robert D. Strain had accepted the position of Center Director of NASA’s GSFC, the Greenbelt, Maryland, facility that develops uncrewed scientific spacecraft and administers NASA’s Earth observation, astronomy, and space physics missions. Strain had been serving as the Head of the Space Department at the Johns Hopkins University’s APL in Laurel, Maryland. He had previously served as the Associate Department Head and Assistant Department Head at APL, and as an executive at Axiom Corporation, Orbital Sciences Corporation, and Fairchild Space and Defense Company. NASA expected that Strain would begin work as Center Director at NASA’s GSFC on 4 August 2008.(NASA, “NASA Names Strain New Goddard Space Flight Center Director,” news release 08-179, 17 July 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jul/HQ_08179_Strain_GSFC_Director.html (accessed 18 May 2011).)
President George W. Bush signed into law Pub. L. No. 110-329, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act for 2009, which included language renewing through July 2016 NASA’s waiver from the Iran-North Korea-Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA). The terms of INKSNA, as enacted in 2000, barred U.S. government agencies from making “extraordinary payments” to Russia, unless the President of the United States had certified that Russia was not exporting missile and nuclear technologies to Iran. Under these terms, NASA would be unable to purchase transport on Soyuz spacecraft. In 2005 Congress had enacted legislation granting NASA a waiver from INKSNA through January 2012, allowing NASA to negotiate a US$700 million contract for occasional flights to the ISS aboard the Russian Soyuz and Progress vehicles. However, that contract would expire in 2011, and Congress needed to renew the waiver before NASA could begin negotiating a new contract. NASA would need to purchase Soyuz vehicles to transport American, Canadian, European and Japanese astronauts to the ISS during the period between the retirement of the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), scheduled for 2010, and the first flights of the Constellation Program, scheduled for 2015.
NASA announced that it had extended the U.S. On-Orbit Segment Acceptance and Vehicle Sustaining Engineering contract awarded to the Boeing Company through 30 September 2010. Originally granted in January 1995, the contract provided engineering support for the ISS. The contractor would complete delivery and on-orbit acceptance of the American section of the ISS, provide end-to-end subsystem management for the majority of the ISS’s systems, support American hardware and software provided to international participants in the ISS program, and sustain engineering of the ISS’s hardware and software. The contractor would work at NASA’s JSC, KSC, and MSFC. The contract was valued at US$350 million.(NASA, “NASA Extend International Space Station Contract,” news release C08-059, 1 October 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/oct/HQ_C08-059_ISS_Contract.html (accessed 16 August 2011).)
A Russian Proton-M rocket launched an American AMC-14 communications satellite at 02:18 (MST), from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, but failed to bring it into correct orbit. The Breeze-M booster on the rocket failed 10 minutes after launch, leaving the satellite 8,000 kilometers (4,971 miles) below geostationary orbit. SES Americom owned the satellite, and Lockheed Martin had built it. The failed satellite had featured a new telecommunications technology that allowed changes in coverage while the satellite was in orbit. The satellite’s design would have enabled it to achieve a higher altitude using its own engine, although this would use up the satellite’s fuel supply and significantly shorten its lifespan.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 653, 1 April 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx653.html (accessed 13 January 2011); Agence France-Presse, “Russian Rocket Fails To Take US Satellite into Planned Orbit,” 14 March 2008.)
NASA successfully launched its Gamma-Ray Large Area Telescope (GLAST) aboard a Delta-2 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 16:05 (UT). GLAST could survey the entire sky every 3 hours, searching for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Scientists hoped to study GRBs to further their understanding of black holes, dark matter, and the laws of physics. GLAST consisted of two elements: the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and the Large Area Telescope (LAT). The GBM was able to detect gamma-ray bursts and to orient the LAT to observe them more closely. NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy, and 37 other research institutions worldwide were collaborating on the US$690 million spacecraft.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 656, 1 July 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx656.html (accessed 24 April 2011); NASA, “NASA’s GLAST Launch Successful,” news release 08-141, 11 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/ home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08141_GLAST_Launch.html (accessed 21 April 2011); Dennis Overbye, “NASA Launches an Orbiting Mystery-Solver,” New York Times, 12 June 2008.)
NASA announced the resignation of S. Alan Stern as Associate Administrator for NASA’s SMD. During his career with NASA, Stern had served as Principal Investigator for the New Horizons Mission to Pluto and as a member of the NASA Advisory Council. NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin announced that Edward J. Weiler would replace Stern as interim Associate Administrator for NASA’s SMD. Before accepting this position, Weiler had served as Director of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).(NASA, “NASA Administrator Announces Science Mission Directorate Leadership Changes,” news release 08- 088, 26 March 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/mar/HQ_08088_ SMD_AA_change.html (accessed 13 January 2001).)
The National Aeronautic Association awarded its prestigious Robert J. Collier trophy to a team of researchers that included staff from NASA’s ARC and NASA’s LaRC. The team, named Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), had developed a system for air traffic control using GPS satellite technology. The system was able to provide air traffic controllers and pilots with highly accurate air traffic data in real-time updated displays. It also gave pilots weather, terrain, and flight-information services. The National Aeronautic Association had been awarding the Collier Trophy since 1911, to researchers with significant achievements in American aeronautics or astronautics.
Officials at NASA’s LaRC announced that they had completed a series of 11 tests on the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne SJX61-2 scramjet engine in the 8-Foot High Temperature wind tunnel. The tests had been NASA’s contribution to the mission to build the X-51 WaveRider aircraft. The design of the X-51 WaveRider would enable the craft to travel at speeds near Mach 7 for approximately 5 minutes. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had been the main contributors to the US$246 million X-51 project. LaRC had tested a combined cycle, jet-fueled, air-breathing, flight-clearance engine, similar to the engine that the X-51would use. NASA engineers expected that they would complete testing by the end of September 2008.(Brian Berger, “NASA Helping U.S. Air Force Gear Up for 2009 X-51 Flights,” Space.com, 8 September 2008, http://www.space.com/5804-nasa-helping-air-force-gear-2009-51-flights.html (accessed 27 July 2011); John Croft, “X-51A Scramjet Readied for Flight Tests,” Flight International, 10 September 2008.)
The X Prize Foundation and Google announced the names of the first 10 teams to qualify to compete in the Google Lunar X Prize competition, which would award US$20 million to the first team to send a rover to the Moon. The winning team must build a rover that would land on the Moon, transmit a data signal back to Earth, travel at least 500 meters (1,640 feet), and then transmit another data signal. The X Prize Foundation would also give US$5 million to the second team to accomplish this goal, as well as offering additional prizes for other lunar achievements, such as the detection of lunar ice. The teams qualifying for the competition were Aeronautics and Cosmonautics Romanian Association (ARCA) of Romania; Astrobotic Technology of the United States; Chandah of the United States; FREDNET, a multinational team; LunaTrex of the Unites States; Micro-Space of the United States; Odyssey Moon of the Isle of Man; Quantum3 of the 22 United States; Southern California Selene Group of the United States; and Team Italia of Italy. The U.S. Navy cruiser Lake Erie fired a missile interceptor that struck down a disabled American spy satellite over the Pacific Ocean. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) managed the 5,000-pound (2,268-kilgram) satellite, which was orbiting 130 miles (209 kilometers) above Earth’s surface, at over 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour), when it was hit at 22:30 (EST). The satellite had been inoperative since shortly after its launch in December 2006. Officials had been concerned that its fuel tank, filled with 1,000 pounds (454 kilograms) of toxic hydrazine, could pose a risk to humans if the satellite fell in a populated area. A heat-seeking missile interceptor, retooled to track the frozen satellite, had accomplished the strike. Military officials had timed the strike to occur after Space Shuttle Atlantis’s 20 February 2008 return to Earth, but before 1 March 2008, when the satellite’s fall into the upper atmosphere would disrupt its orbit, making it more difficult to hit. Officials stated that they believed that the impact had been strong enough to incinerate the fuel tank, although they would not know for 24 hours whether that had actually occurred.(Thom Shanker, “Missile Strikes a Spy Satellite Falling From Its Orbit,” New York Times, 21 February 2008. 24 NASA, “NASA Selects New Deputy Associate Administrator of Strategic Partnerships and Space Program Manager,” news release 08-065, 22 February 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/feb/ HQ_08065_ New_Shuttle_Manage.html (accessed 28 December 2010).)
Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 1:25 p.m. (PST), returning seven astronauts from a 16-day mission to the ISS. While aboard the ISS, crew members had unloaded over 7 tons (6.35 tonnes or 6,350.29 kilograms) of cargo from Endeavour; set up a refrigerator, exercise machine, two sleep stations, and a rack for science experiments; and activated a recycling system to turn astronauts’ urine and perspiration into potable water. The crew of Endeavour brought back samples so that NASA scientists could test the water before NASA approved the system for use. Astronauts Heidemarie M. Stefanyshyn- Piper, Stephen G. Bowen, and Robert S. Kimbrough had conducted four spacewalks to repair the
NASA announced the appointment of N. Wayne Hale Jr. as NASA’s Deputy Associate Administrator for Strategic Partnerships. Hale had begun his three-decade career with NASA in 1978 in Flight Operations at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC). Hale had headed the Propulsion Systems Section of Mission Control from 1985 to 1988 and had overseen flight- control teams in Mission Control during all aspects of 40 Space Shuttle missions. He had served as Manager of the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) since 2005. In his new position, Hale would work in the Space Operations Mission Directorate to build alliances across the public and private sectors. John P. Shannon, who had served as Hale’s deputy since 2005, would succeed him as SSP Manager. Shannon had begun his career with NASA in 1988. When NASA appointed him Space Shuttle Flight Director in 1993, Shannon had become the youngest person in NASA’s history to hold that post. After Shannon served as Deputy Director of the Columbia Task Force in 2003, NASA had selected him to create the SSP’s Flight Operations and Integration Office.
The Spacecraft Crew Survival Integrated Investigation Team, a multidisciplinary team based at NASA’s JSC, issued an in-depth study of the safety equipment and safety procedures that the crew of Columbia had used during the Columbia disaster. The study, the first comprehensive report on crew survival in a spaceflight accident, detailed five lethal events that had occurred during the breakup of Columbia. The team determined that, even with better cabin equipment, hypersonic-entry conditions would have prevented crew survival. The report issued 30 recommendations to improve crew safety and vehicle design, covering topics such as crew training, individual safety equipment, procedures, restraints, spacecraft design, and future accident investigations. NASA had already implemented some of the recommendations, and NASA officials were assessing others.(NASA, “NASA Report Reviews Crew Safety Measures During Columbia Accident, Recommends Improvements,” news release M08-269, 30 December 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/dec/HQ_ M08269_Crew_Safety.html (accessed 22 August 2011); John Schwartz, “Report on Columbia Details How Astronauts Died,” New York Times, 31 December 2008; see also NASA, “Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report” (report no.

The Russian Soyuz TMA-11 landed in Kazakhstan at 04:30 (EDT), after a ballistic reentry that deposited the spacecraft approximately 295 miles (474.76 kilometers) from its intended landing location. NASA officials explained that, in a ballistic reentry, a spacecraft reenters Earth’s atmosphere at an angle steeper than normal, subjecting the astronauts to higher gravitational forces. Russian officials pledged to investigate the cause of the rough landing. The crew members on board—Peggy A. Whitson, Yuri I. Malenchenko, and So-yeon Yi—did not report any injuries from the incident. The three crew members were returning to Earth after completing Expedition 16 to the ISS. Yi, South Korea’s first astronaut, had been aboard the ISS for 10 days, conducting experiments. Whitson, an American astronaut, had served as the first female commander of the ISS. During this mission, she had set the record for the most cumulative time an American had spent in space. Malenchenko, a Russian cosmonaut, had been Flight Engineer for Expedition 16. During the busy mission, lasting six months, crew members had conducted a wide variety of scientific experiments. During seven spacewalks, they had attached new modules to the ISS, repaired damages to the station, and received three visits from the Shuttle and one visit from ESA’s unpiloted cargo ship Jules Verne.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 654; Tariq Malik, “Space Station Astronauts Land Off-Target, But Safely,” Space.com, 19 April 2008, http://www.space.com/5262-space-station-astronauts-land-target-safely.html (accessed 3 March 2011); NASA, “Expedition 16 Soyuz Lands Safely in Kazakhstan,” news release 08-105, 19 April 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/apr/HQ_08105_Exp_16_lands.html (accessed 17 February 2011).)
Harrison “Jack” H. Schmitt, a scientist, former astronaut, and former U.S. Senator, announced that he was resigning as Chair of the NASA Advisory Council. The NASA Advisory Council, a panel of experts in various fields, advised the NASA Administrator on major policy. Since becoming Chair in November 2005, Schmitt had led the Advisory Council in submitting over 100 recommendations to the NASA Administrator. He had been the primary advocate behind a February 2007 workshop that produced 35 scientific recommendations related to NASA’s return to the Moon and had led the Advisory Council’s efforts to build relationships fostering the use of the ISS as a national laboratory. NASA named Kenneth M. Ford as the new Advisory Council Chair. Ford had served on the Exploration Committee of the Advisory Council since June 2007. He was the founder and Director of the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition. Ford had developed and directed NASA’s Center of Excellence in Information Technology at NASA’s ARC. He had also served as both Director and Associate Director of NASA’s ARC. A recipient of NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal and the Robert S. Englemore Memorial Award, Ford had served on the U.S. Air Force Science Advisory Board and the National Science Board. He was also a fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.(NASA, “Schmitt Completes NASA Advisory Council service; Ford Named Chairman,” news release 08-262, 16 October 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/oct/HQ_08-261_Scmitt_Leaves_NAC.html (accessed 8 August 2011).)
ESA launched its Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element (GIOVE-B), the second of its Galileo global navigation system satellites, at 22:16 (UT). The 500-kilogram (1,102.31-pound) satellite lifted off aboard a Russian Soyuz-Fregat from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. GIOVE-B, like its predecessor GIOVE-A, was a test craft for a fleet which would eventually total 30 satellites. Once completed, ESA officials intended for the Galileo program to be interoperable with the American GPS and the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Because navigation systems rely on precise timing, GIOVE-B carried two redundant rubidium atomic clocks, which would serve as back up to the Passive Hydrogen Maser (PHM). The PHM was the most accurate clock that had ever been placed in orbit, with a stability of better than 1 nanosecond per day. GIOVE-B also carried a radiation-monitoring payload and a laser retroreflector for high-accuracy laser ranging. Astrium GmbH had built the satellite, with the assistance of Thales Alenia Space.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 654, 1 May 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx654.html (accessed 17 February 2011); ESA, “ESA’s Most Advanced Navigation Satellite Launched Tonight,” press release no. 25-2008, 27 April 2008, http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM9GD2QGFF_index_0.html (accessed 17 February 2011); BBC News, “Europe Launches Sat-Nav Tester,” 26 April 2008.)
The Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2 satellite launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Delta-2 rocket at 07:46 (UT). The 510-kilogram (1,124.36-pound) craft was a joint mission of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT); the French space agency (Centre National d’Études Spatiales—CNES); the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and NASA. EUMETSAT’s aim was to continue the data-collection mission that NASA and CNES had begun in 1992 with their ocean topography experiment, the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, and had continued with the 2001 launch of Jason 1. Jason 2 had five instruments—improved versions of those aboard Jason 1— that could chart the topography of the ocean’s surface, the speed and direction of the ocean’s current, and the amount of solar energy the ocean stores. Scientists hoped to use these measurements to track global climate change, to hone their predictions of hurricane intensity, and to improve their understanding of currents, eddies, and tides. The project partners had scheduled Jason 2 to fly in tandem with Jason 1 for approximately six months, while engineers calibrated Jason 2’s instruments. Afterwards, the two spacecraft would travel in separate orbits, doubling the global satellite coverage.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 656, 1 July 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx656.html (accessed 24 April 2011); NASA, “NASA Launches Ocean Satellite To Keep a Weather, Climate Eye Open,” news release 08-154, 20 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08154_OSTM-Jason-2_Launch.html (accessed 21 April 2011).)
John S. Bull, a member of NASA’s original class of 19 astronauts, died at the age of 73. He had never flown in space. Bull had begun to train as an astronaut in 1966. In early 1967, NASA had chosen him as a member of the crew of LTA-8, a thermal-vacuum test of the Moon lander. However, sinus problems had prevented him from participating in the mission. In November 1967, NASA had selected Bull for the support crew of the Apollo 8 mission. However, he had resigned from the astronaut corps in July 1968 because he had a rare pulmonary disorder. Bull had obtained a Master’s degree and a PhD from Stanford University, returning to NASA in 1973. He had performed flight-test research at NASA’s ARC until 1986 and had then managed NASA- wide research programs in autonomous systems technology for space applications, until his retirement in 1989.(Collectspace.com, “John S.

A Russian Soyuz TMA-12 passenger-transport craft launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 12:17 (UT), marking the beginning of the ISS’s Expedition 17 mission. The Soyuz carried Russian cosmonauts, Sergei A. Volkov and Oleg D. Kononenko, and South Korean astronaut So-yeon Yi. Yi, the first South Korean to enter space, would stay on the ISS for only 10 days, conducting experiments. She would then return to Earth with the departing Expedition 16 crew members, aboard a Soyuz TMA-11 that had been docked at the ISS since October 2007. Kononenko was Expedition 17’s Flight Engineer, and Volkov was the mission’s Commander. Volkov was the son of cosmonaut Alexander A. Volkov, making this launch the first occasion of a second-generation cosmonaut or astronaut traveling to space. The third member of the expedition, American astronaut Garrett E. Reisman, was already aboard the ISS. Over the course of six months, the crew of Expedition 17 planned to install the large Japanese Kibo laboratory, supervise the undocking of ESA’s Jules Verne ATV, and complete at least one spacewalk.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 654, 1 May 2008, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacewarn/spx654.html (accessed 17 February 2011); Clara Moskowitz, “New Station Crew, Korean Astronaut Rocket Into Space,” Space.com, 8 April 2008, http://www.space.com/5217-station-crew-korean-astronaut-rocket-space.html (accessed 3 March 2011).)
NASA announced that it had exhibited a new robot rover that would be able to drill into the lunar surface to find water and oxygen-dense soil. The rover, Scarab, would not travel to the Moon itself. Instead, NASA had designed Scarab as a research rover, to give scientists an opportunity to study drilling technologies that they could use in the difficult environment of the Moon, noted for its continuous darkness, minimal gravity, and extremely abrasive and dense soil. The rover was a joint effort among many institutions. NASA’s ARC had built Scarab’s navigation system, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) had funded a camera; NASA’s GRC had been responsible for its power-management system; the Northern Centre for Advanced Technology had built its drill; and Carnegie Mellon University had overseen the rover’s design and testing. The Human Robotic Systems and In-Situ Resource Utilization projects at NASA’s JSC, part of the Exploration Technology Development Programs that LaRC managed, had collaborated on the project.(NASA, “NASA Demonstrates Robot Technology for Moon Exploration,” news release 08-067, 27 February 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/feb/HQ_08067_lunar_robot.html (accessed 28 December 2010); CBC News, “NASA Shows Off Rover Armed with Canadian-Made Drill,” 27 February 2008, http://www.cbc.ca/ technology/story/2008/02/27/tech-rover-drill.html (accessed 5 January 2011).)
A team of astronomers led by Peter F. Michelson of Stanford University announced in the online version of the journal Science that NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope had discovered a pulsar after detecting its gamma-ray beams. Pulsars, which are rapidly spinning collapsed neutron stars, emit radiation from their poles in jets that sweep past Earth. Usually, scientists detect the energy as radio waves and, occasionally, as x rays or visible light. Fermi’s sighting was the first time that scientists had seen a pulsar that only emits gamma rays. The team speculated that, although the pulsar might emit energy in other wavelengths, only the gamma-ray beam is wide enough for astronomers to detect from Earth. Part of the supernova CTA 1, the pulsar is approximately 4,600 light-years away from Earth, in the constellation Cepheus. Its gamma rays blink past Earth every 316.86 seconds. The team of astronomers believed that Fermi would find more gamma-ray pulsars, allowing scientists to learn more about their magnetic fields and about the rate at which stars explode.(NASA, “NASA’s Fermi’s Telescope Discovers First Gamma-Ray-Only Pulsar,” news release 08-259, 16 October 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/oct/HQ_08-259_Fermi_GRP.html (accessed 8 August 2011); Rachel Courtland, “First Pulsar Identified by Its Gamma Rays Alone,” New Scientist, 17 October 2008, http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14968 (accessed 10 August 2011); see also A.

At the American Geophysical Union’s Fall Meeting, a team of scientists led by Bethany L. Ehlmann of Brown University announced that they had found carbonate minerals in Martian bedrock. The team had used the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on NASA’s MRO to observe carbonate exposures in the Isidis basin, particularly along the trough system known as Nili Fossae. Carbonates form when carbon dioxide and water interact with calcium, iron, or magnesium in volcanic rocks. Because carbonates dissolve quickly in acid, their presence indicated that Mars had once possessed neutral or alkaline water. A nonacidic environment would have favored ancient life forms. Previous researchers had found carbonates in Martian soil or dust, but the presence of carbonates in bedrock indicated that they might have formed over extended periods during Mars’s early history. The journal Science planned to publish the study’s findings in its 19 December 2008 edition.(NASA, “Scientists Find ‘Missing’ Mineral and Clues to Mars Mysteries,” news release 08-331, 18 December 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/dec/HQ_08-331_Mars_minerals.html; see also Bethany L. Ehlmann et al., “Orbital Identification of Carbonate-Bearing Rocks on Mars,” Science 322, no. 5909 (19 December 2008): 1828−1832.)
Atlantis landed at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) at 14:08 (UT) after a 13-day journey to the ISS, successfully completing the Shuttle mission STS-122, to deliver and install ESA’s microgravity science laboratory Columbus. The seven-member crew included American astronauts Stephen N. Frick, Alan G. Poindexter, Leland D. Melvin, Rex J. Walheim, and Stanley G. Love, and ESA astronauts Hans W. Schlegel and Léopold Eyharts. The mission had begun with a 19:45 (UT) launch on 7 February 2008 from KSC and had included three spacewalks. Crew members had docked the Columbus laboratory to the Harmony module of the ISS; installed power, data, and cooling cables to the laboratory; replaced a spent nitrogen tank; placed two science experiments on the laboratory’s exterior; retrieved a broken gyroscope; installed a solar monitor; and positioned the European Technology Exposure Facility. STS-122 had also exchanged Eyharts for American astronaut Daniel M. Tani, who had been aboard the ISS for almost four months.(Spacewarn Bulletin, no. 652; NASA, “Shuttle Atlantis Crew Returns Home After Successful Mission,” news release 08-061, 20 February 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/feb/HQ_08061_Atlantis_Lands.html (accessed 28 December 2010).)
Warner K. Dahm, the last of Wernher von Braun’s German rocket team to retire from NASA, died at age 90 in Huntsville, Alabama. A German aerodynamics expert, Dahm had joined von Braun’s program during World War II and had later come to the United States with his colleagues to assist in developing American rocketry. He had worked at NASA first as a member of the team for Operation Paperclip in Texas and later at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Over the years, Dahm had lent his expertise to the design of the V-2 and Wasserfall anti-aircraft rockets, the Redstone rocket, the Jupiter ballistic missile, Saturn 1, Saturn 1B, the Saturn-5 rocket that flew America’s first astronauts to the Moon, Skylab, and the Space Shuttle Transportation System. In 2006, at the age of 89, he had retired from his position as Chief 5 Aerodynamicist at Marshall. Dahm had received NASA’s Exceptional Service Medal in 2003.
Robert C. Seamans Jr., who had served as NASA Deputy Administrator during the Apollo era, died of heart failure at age 89. Seamans had begun his career as a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1940s. In 1960 he had accepted a position with NASA as Associate Administrator, and, from 1965 to 1968, he had served as Deputy Administrator. During his tenure, NASA had worked to achieve President John F. Kennedy’s goal of landing a man on the Moon, and Seamans had been instrumental to the success of that mission. In 1968 Seamans had left his position at NASA to return to MIT, although he remained a consultant to NASA’s Administrator. Later that year, he had assisted in making the controversial decision to send Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon, a move that had laid the groundwork for the lunar landing. Seamans had served as Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from 1969 to 1973. In 1974 he had been appointed Administrator of the Energy, Research and Development Administration, a predecessor agency to the Department of Energy. In 1977 Seamans had accepted a position as Dean of the School of Engineering at MIT, where he had continued to teach aeronautics classes even after his formal retirement in 1984.(Peter Schworm, “Robert Seamans; Helped Lead NASA During Apollo Missions,” Boston Globe, 30 June 2008. 79 NASA, “Astronaut James Reilly Leaves NASA,” news release 08-162, 30 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/ hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08163_Seamans_statement.html (accessed 21 April 2011).)
GAO released a report assessing NASA’s challenges in defining the scope and costs of Space Shuttle transition and retirement. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (Pub. L. No. 110161), had directed GAO to evaluate NASA’s plans and progress in transitioning and retiring the SSP’s equipment and facilities. From February 2008 to August 2008, GAO had examined the challenges NASA had faced in defining the scope and costs of retiring the SSP. GAO had noted whether NASA had reflected these costs in its budget requests. The report noted some specific challenges in ascertaining costs, including NASA’s need to determine which SSP equipment would be retained for the Constellation Program; the cost of making artifacts from the SSP safe for public display, and how to offset many costs through the exchange or sale of property. The report determined that NASA’s 2010 budget request had not accurately reflected the costs of SSP retirement, partly because NASA had not yet assessed those costs, and partly because NASA had not reflected some of the SSP’s indirect costs in the SSP budget line. The report directed NASA to include in its budget requests for FY 2010, and for future years, its best estimates of total direct and indirect costs of transition and retirement of the SSP. NASA concurred with GAO’s recommendation.(U.S. Government Accountability Office, “NASA: Agency Faces Challenges Defining Scope and Costs of Space Shuttle Transition and Retirement” (report no. GAO-08-1096, Washington, DC, September 2008), http://www.gao. gov/new.items/d081096.pdf (accessed 3 August 2011).)
