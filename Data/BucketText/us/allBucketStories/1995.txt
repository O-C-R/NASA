A new Mission Control center at the Johnson Space Center began operating about 10 hours after the launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery. It replaces the 30 year old Mission Control which began controlling manned space flights in Houston rather than at Cape Canaveral, Florida. A network of 200 computer work stations are replacing the lumbering and inflexible, but highly reliable mainframe computer. Launchings and landings, the most dangerous parts of space flight, will be monitored from the original Mission Control at least through the end of the year to be sure there are no glitches with the new center.

Astronomers detected a gigantic mass, equivalent to 40 million Suns, in a distant galaxy that they believe to be a black hole. The discovery, announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona, was made by a team of American and Japanese scientists using a computer-linked system of 10 radio telescope dishes stretching from the Virgin Islands to Hawaii known as the Very Long Baseline Array. Since black holes, by definition, emit no visible light or other radiation, astronomers infer their presence by their strong gravitational pull on surrounding stars.  The discovery was made by observing the rotation of a disk of gas and dust surrounding a galactic nucleus.

The claim of a new discovery by three NASA astronomers was refuted by a galaxy expert who was invited to their press conference. At a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona, the astronomers claimed to have discovered six dwarf spiral galaxies, which they also claimed astronomers long thought existed but had never found. The Canadian galaxy expert claimed that dwarf spirals had been discovered by astronomers in the 1950's. (AP, Jan 11/95; Reuter, Jan 10/95)
NASA and Russian space station officials were scheduled to begin a series of technical exchange meetings at the Johnson Space Center intended to give clear direction to joint cooperation in constructing the international space station. Twenty-five teams of Russian technicians and engineers were expected to arrive to discuss a number of issues, including docking procedures, power supply distribution; structural mechanics, depressurization; and place and use of antennae. Crew size was also to be discussed. The meetings were expected to last until February 10. NASA officials hoped to agree on as much common ground as possible so that Russia could be made an official partner in the station project before the year is out.

Two astronomers at the American Astronomical Society's annual meeting in Tucson, Arizona, presented an extraordinary photograph of a nearby star in red-hot death throes similar to the cataclysm that astronomers theorize will destroy the solar system in several billion years. The photo, taken with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, showed never-before-seen detail in the glowing red gas cloud ejected by the dying star. The "Cat's Eye Nebula," or NGC 6543, is about 3,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Draco, the dragon. (B Sun, Jan 12/95)
Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope to study quasars began to reassess their theories after studying a series of quasars during the past few months. The astronomers expected the quasars, thought to be super-massive "black holes," to be surrounded by galaxies that "feed" the quasar. Instead, none of the first eight quasars they studied was surrounded by a galaxy, raising questions about of how black holes form and sustain themselves. "I really don't understand this," said project astronomer John Bahcall in a report to the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona. (LA Times, Jan 13/95; W Post, Jan 13/95)
After several attempts in 1994, Russian cosmonauts successfully tested the Mir space station's automatic docking equipment, clearing the way for the seven to ten scheduled dockings with American space shuttles through 1997.

Anatoly Kiselyov, General Director of the Khrunichev State Space Research and Industrial Center, said that NASA's terms for financing the work to develop and build the cargo module for the Alpha Station were unrealistic and that Russian air and space firms could not agree to them. Kiselyov said the real costs of building the functional cargo module would be 40 to 50 percent higher than American estimates, or at least $220 million. The cargo module is to be the first component of a future space station and is scheduled for launch in November 1997. It will serve as the basis on which to build a future space complex.

Atmospheric scientists presented some 40 papers or abstracts at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Tucson, Arizona, on the topic of newly-discovered discharges of lightning in Earth's upper atmosphere. The upper-atmospheric lightning materializes above thunderheads and shoots upward, not downward, in bolts and flickers that soar as high as 60 miles above the surface of the Earth. Satellites have detected gamma ray bursts emanating from thunderheads, whereas red flashes have been linked to powerful burst of radio waves. NASA planned to fly a jet loaded with cameras and instruments across the thunderstorm belt of South America in February to begin serious study of upper atmospheric lightning.
