The first attempt to launch a fully private funded rocket ended in failure when the 58foottall "Koopman Express" sounding rocket caught fire while still on the launch pad. The rocket was to have flown on a 15minute suborbital flight from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, during which it would have released a cloud of inert gas to test sensors on a military Delta Star satellite. The rocket was also scheduled to deploy an engineering model of a Parashield during reentry into the atmosphere.

An unarmed Air Force Midgetman missile went off course and was destroyed shortly after launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The missile began to tumble 70 seconds into the flight during its second stage burn, causing the range safety officer to transmit a selfdestruct command. The Midgetman, which was undergoing its first flight test, had been programmed to deliver a dummy warhead 4,600 miles over the Pacific Ocean to the Kwajalen Atoll test range. Despite the failure, the test was declared a partial success by the Air Force. (NY Times, May 12/89; WSJ, May 12/89; USA Today, May 12/89; W Times, May 12/89)

A team of astronomers reported that they had discovered evidence of "brown dwarfs," large celestial objects that are intermediate in size between planets and stars. The findings,' 0*presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, showed evidence of at least nine brown dwarfs orbiting stars in the constellation Taurus. The observed objects were believed to be from 5 to 20 times the size of Jupiter. Evidence of brown dwarfs was expected to help account for some of the "missing" dark matter believed to exist in the universe. (W Post, Jun 15/89; P Inq, Jun
The Space Shuttle Discovery was successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on mission STS29, the main objective to deploy the final Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS4). Discovery carried a crew of five on a 5day mission. Six hours into the mission, the 2.5 ton $100 million TDRS4 was successfully deployed into low Earth orbit where it subsequently boosted itself into a 22,300 mile geosynchronous orbit. Discovery also carried biological experiments that to conduct studies of the embryonic development of chickens and bone healing in rats in a microgravity environment. The STS28 crew would also photograph and film environmentally damaged areas throughout the world for later scientific analysis. Discovery's launch had been delayed a month because of cracks found in the main engine turbopumps. Replacement occurred on the launch pad. During the mission, a hydrogen tank supplying the Shuttle's fuel cells was temporarily shut down because of erratic pressure readings. The problem, which caused a temporary electricity shortage aboard the Shuttle, was resolved the following day, allowing Discovery to stay in orbit for five days as planned. Discovery successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 19.

A coalition of three antinuclear groups filed suit in the Washington, D.C. Federal District Court to stop the launch of the nuclearpowered Galileo space probe aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. The three groups contended that NASA and the Department of Energy had illegally delayed release of health and safety risk assessments of a potential accident involving Galileo's plutoniumfueled radioisotope thermal generators. The groups filing suit were the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, the Christic Institute, and the Foundation on Economic Trends. NASA and the Energy Department denied the charges, and the space agency continued to carry on with preparations for the planned launch of0*AtlantisGalileo on October 12.

This date marked the twentieth anniversary of the first crewassisted landing on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin. Armstrong, Aldrin, and their crewmate, Michael Collins, commemorated the lunar landing with ceremonies at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC, and the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. During the Washington ceremony, attended by President George Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, the President proposed a long range program of humanassisted space exploration, including a permanently habitable base on the Moon and a crew expedition to Mars, but did not establish a specific timetable. The President cited Space Station Freedom as an important stepping stone toward missions to the Moon and Mars. Speaking at the National Air and Space Museum, Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to step on the lunar surface, said: "The Apollo program enjoyed a certain nobility of purposea program not to conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance. A program not to exploit, but to explore. A program not to take from others, but to give to all, to give new knowledge, to enlarge the human horizon."

A group of U.S. and Canadian astronomers announced that they had discovered evidence of vigorous activity in a whitedwarf star previously thought to be a stellar "corpse." This new and unexpected behavior may offer astronomers new insight into how stars are born, evolve, and ultimately die. The whitedwarf star, catalogued as 0950+139, lies at the center of the faint nebula called EGB6 and is located about 1500 light years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Leo. The findings were presented at the 173rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. (NASA Release 893, Jan 11/89)
The Space Shuttle Atlantis was successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on mission STS34 to0*deploy the $1.4 billion Galileo Jupiter space probe. The Atlantis launch had been delayed by a week because of problems with a computer, a main engine master control device, and, finally, rain. Shortly after reaching orbit, Atlantis released the Galileo probe and the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) from the cargo bay. The IUS subsequently fired Galileo on a trajectory toward Venus, in preparation for a gravity assist maneuver that would swing the spacecraft back toward Earth twice and onward to Jupiter. Galileo was scheduled to reach Jupiter in December 1995, whereupon it would begin orbiting the planet for 22 months of observations of the Jovian system. Approximately five months before reaching Jupiter, Galileo would release a 34inch unpowered descent module that would enter the Jovian upper atmosphere and descend several hundred miles before being destroyed by extreme atmospheric pressure. The AtlantisGalileo mission had sparked protests and a law suit by antinuclear groups concerned over the danger of possible radioactive contamination from the probe's radioisotope thermal generators in the event of a catastrophic accident. In anticipation of possible efforts to disrupt the launch, NASA increased security measures at KSC. In addition to launching Galileo, the STS34 crew would conduct observations of the Earth's ozone layer and perform several onboard medical, biological, and materials processing experiments. The crew included Navy Captain Donald E. Williams (Commander), Navy Commander Michael J. McCulley (Pilot), and Mission Specialists Shannon Lucid, Franklin Changaz, and Ellen S. Baker. The mission ended successfully on October 23 with Atlantis landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

A team of astronomers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Princeton University announced the discovery of the oldest and most distant object yet observed in the universe. The object was reported to be a quasar at a distance of 10 to 15 billion lightyears from Earth, which may have formed when the universe was only about a billion years old. The discovery challenged conventional theories on the timetable for the formation of galaxies and galacticsized bodies in the early universe. Previous observations had placed the age of most quasars at about 3 billion years after the Big Bang. The new observations were expected to produce major revisions in theories of how matter coalesced during the early universe.
