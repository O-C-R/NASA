At the American Astronomical Society convention, scientists Karl Gebhardt and Douglas O. Richstone announced that an extensive survey of more than 30 galaxies had revealed that black holes reach their large size through gradual growth. Previously, some research had suggested the opposite⎯that black holes were simply “born” big. Using the HST, Gebhardt and Richstone had led a team of astronomers in determining the size of black holes in different galaxies. They found that, although small galaxies tend to have smaller black holes, the largest known galaxies have mammoth black holes. The astronomers suspected that the black holes had “grown up” along with the galaxies where they resided, feeding on gas and stars to acquire increasing mass. Although further research must determine the precise correlation between black hole and galaxy size, the scientific community greeted news of the discovery with great interest. The HST had not only made the discovery possible but had provided the opportunity for scientists to continue “black hole hunting,” to tabulate more exact answers.(NASA, “Black Holes Shed Light on Galaxy Formation,” news release 00-88, 5 June 2000. 267)
billion years old, astronomers expressed their excitement that the benchmark discovery would enable them to observe the universe in its formative stages.(Associated Press, “Quasar Discovered by Student May Be Most Distant Ever Seen,” 15 April 2000; Kevin Coughlin, “Young Princeton Expert Finds Piece of a Fledgling Universe,” Star-Ledger (Newark, NJ), 14 April 2000; Washington Post, “Most Distant Object Observed,” 17 April 2000.)
