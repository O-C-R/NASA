NASA declared successful the mission of Nimbus 7, launched October 24, 1978, from Vandernberg Air Force Base into a polar orbit. Using eight interdisciplinary research experiments representing domestic and international scientific and government communities, it accomplished mission objectives, including proof of the feasibility of mapping upper-atmosphere characteristics, of supplying space-collected oceanographic data to scientific uses, and of extending the solar-radiation and Earth-radiation data base. Objectives were met or exceeded with high-quality and high-quantity data, and Nimbus 7would continue into its seventh year “in good health.” (NASA MOR E-604-78-08 [postlaunch] Jan 21/83)
