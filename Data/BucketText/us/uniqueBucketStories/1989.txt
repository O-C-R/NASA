An unarmed Air Force Midgetman missile went off course and was destroyed shortly after launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The missile began to tumble 70 seconds into the flight during its second stage burn, causing the range safety officer to transmit a selfdestruct command. The Midgetman, which was undergoing its first flight test, had been programmed to deliver a dummy warhead 4,600 miles over the Pacific Ocean to the Kwajalen Atoll test range. Despite the failure, the test was declared a partial success by the Air Force. (NY Times, May 12/89; WSJ, May 12/89; USA Today, May 12/89; W Times, May 12/89)
Dr. C. Howard Robins, Jr. was named NASA Associate Administrator for Management, effective January 9. His primary responsibility was to help strengthen NASA's core organizational and infrastructural capabilities. Robins, a 30year NASA veteran, would replace Manuel Peralta, who left NASA to become president of the American National Standards Institute. (NASA Release 891, Jan 5/89; W Times, Jan 11/89)
A team of astronomers reported that they had discovered evidence of "brown dwarfs," large celestial objects that are intermediate in size between planets and stars. The findings,' 0*presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society, showed evidence of at least nine brown dwarfs orbiting stars in the constellation Taurus. The observed objects were believed to be from 5 to 20 times the size of Jupiter. Evidence of brown dwarfs was expected to help account for some of the "missing" dark matter believed to exist in the universe. (W Post, Jun 15/89; P Inq, Jun
A group of U.S. and Canadian astronomers announced that they had discovered evidence of vigorous activity in a whitedwarf star previously thought to be a stellar "corpse." This new and unexpected behavior may offer astronomers new insight into how stars are born, evolve, and ultimately die. The whitedwarf star, catalogued as 0950+139, lies at the center of the faint nebula called EGB6 and is located about 1500 light years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Leo. The findings were presented at the 173rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. (NASA Release 893, Jan 11/89)
A team of astronomers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and Princeton University announced the discovery of the oldest and most distant object yet observed in the universe. The object was reported to be a quasar at a distance of 10 to 15 billion lightyears from Earth, which may have formed when the universe was only about a billion years old. The discovery challenged conventional theories on the timetable for the formation of galaxies and galacticsized bodies in the early universe. Previous observations had placed the age of most quasars at about 3 billion years after the Big Bang. The new observations were expected to produce major revisions in theories of how matter coalesced during the early universe.

The last Titan 34D launch vehicle in the Air Force's inventory was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force station in Florida, carrying a classified Department of Defense payload. This was the final launch of the Titan 3 series launch vehicles, which were being replaced by the more powerful Titan 4.

Astronomers at Cornell University announced the discovery of an apparent galaxy in the making, challenging conventional theory that galaxies formed only during the early history of the universe. The galaxy observed by Cornell astronomer Martha Haynes and Ricardo Giovanelli appeared to contain no fully developed stars and to consist of only protostellar material, mainly hydrogen. The observed galaxy, named UGC7394, was 65 million light years distant. (UPI, Aug 29/89; WSJ, Aug 29/89; W H&Times, Aug 29/89; B Sun, Aug 29/89; C Trib, Aug 29/89)
