The Office of Technology Assessment warned that Space debris could make space activity too risky in 20 to 30 years if the most traveled orbits continue to be littered. With the average collision velocity in low Earth orbit 6.2 miles per second, an object having 1/35th the weight of an aspirin tablet has the impact of a .30caliber bullet, they said. The Air Force tracks such debris to advise NASA before Shuttle missions, but no course change has ever been deemed necessary. (W Post, Oct 12/90; C Trib, Oct 14/90)
Three SR71 Blackbird aircraft, reconnaissance planes being retired by the Air Force, were Scheduled to arrive in February at Edwards Air Force Base in California, for "flyable storage." NASA hoped to use the highspeed aircraft, capable of Mach 3 at 80,000 feet, for tests relating to the Space Plane later in the year. Daily News, Jan 30/90; NASA Release 9024)
The Air Force and NASA entered their final stage of a $250 million, tenyear experiment for the X29 program, scheduled to be completed in March 1991. The test plane was designed to be 30 percent unstable and was dependent upon a sophisticated flight control system to produce and maintain stability. Glenn Spacht of Grumman Corporation, developer of the X29 and producer of the F14, said, "When applied to the F14, the plane will get better handling qualities, survivability, maneuverability, and antispin characteristics....The F14 can certainly reap the benefits of the X29."

A joint NASA/U.S. Geological Survey team of American scientists planned to work with a Soviet Science team to study volcanoes along Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, part of the Pacific's "Ring of Fire." The study would mark the first time Western scientists had been allowed in the region. (NASA Release
In a flight test that concluded in August, NASA, the Air Force, and Boeing Commercial Airline Group announced betterthanexpected findings taken from the results of modifying a 22foot section of a Boeing 757 wing. The design reduced drag in what could equate to 10 percent if the entire span of both wings had been modified. A 1percent reduction would have amounted to a $100 million annual savings in fuel costs for the U.S. airline industry. (NASA Release 90115)
