Astronomers detected a gigantic mass, equivalent to 40 million Suns, in a distant galaxy that they believe to be a black hole. The discovery, announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona, was made by a team of American and Japanese scientists using a computer-linked system of 10 radio telescope dishes stretching from the Virgin Islands to Hawaii known as the Very Long Baseline Array. Since black holes, by definition, emit no visible light or other radiation, astronomers infer their presence by their strong gravitational pull on surrounding stars.  The discovery was made by observing the rotation of a disk of gas and dust surrounding a galactic nucleus.

The claim of a new discovery by three NASA astronomers was refuted by a galaxy expert who was invited to their press conference. At a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona, the astronomers claimed to have discovered six dwarf spiral galaxies, which they also claimed astronomers long thought existed but had never found. The Canadian galaxy expert claimed that dwarf spirals had been discovered by astronomers in the 1950's. (AP, Jan 11/95; Reuter, Jan 10/95)
