Russian rocket engines will be offered by United Technologies for sale in the United States. United Technologies Corp.�s Pratt & Whitney unit agreed to market two of Energomash�s rocket engines. The hope is that the engine will power the X-34 reusable rocket. (Space News, Jun 26/95; WSJ, Jul 19/95)
Intelsat, the US satellite operator, signed a record $2 billion insurance contract for 10 satellite launches with the insurance firm International Space Brokers, Inc. The contract covered launches on the Ariane 4 rocket of the European Arianespace Consortium and on China's Long March rocket. (Reuters, Jan 11/95)
A Russian booster rocket placed a US commercial communications satellite into orbit for the first time. The FAISAT satellite was owned by Final Analysis, Inc., of Greenbelt, Maryland. (H Chron, Jan 25/95; ITAR-TASS, Jan 24/95)
NASA is working with industry to develop an air-launched, fly-back booster called the X-34. The U.S. hopes that a financially viable X-34 will return it to leadership in commercial space transportation. (Fla Today, Mar 31/95; AvWk, Apr 3/95)
NASA requested proposals for two vehicles, X-33 and X-34, to prove the concept of single-stage to orbit. The X-33 would be a technology demonstrator vehicle and the X-34 would be a reusable, or partially-reusable, booster for placing small payloads into a low Earth orbit. Significant cost-sharing by industry was anticipated. (NASA Releases 95-1, 23, 38 & 40)
Lockheed Martin�s new rocket malfunctioned as it was launched from Vandenburg AFB, California. The Lockheed Launch Vehicle (LLV-1) was designed to place payloads weighing up to one ton into low Earth orbit.

The Delta 3 launch vehicle has a new second stage rocket engine planned for use in 1998. The new engine will be capable of generating 24,000 pounds of thrust. In combination with the larger solid-fueled boosters, the McDonnell Douglas Delta 3 will be able to carry twice the weight of the Delta into an orbit 22,300 miles above the surface of the Earth�s equator. (Fla Today, Jul 7/95; AvWk, Sep 25/95)
NASA invited bids from the nation's aerospace companies to develop two reusable rocket designs under a novel strategy that called for the industry to pay much of the cost. The goal was to enhance the competitive footing of U. S. companies in the lucrative global commercial launch market while lowering the amount spent annually by the federal government on space transportation.
A Chinese Long March 2E rocket carrying a telecommunications satellite exploded and crashed to earth moments after launch, a setback to space ambitions of China and major global broadcasters. The Apstar 2 satellite, built by Hughes Aircraft, would have provided television, telephone, and digital communications to a vast swath of Asia, Eastern Europe, North Africa, and Australia.

NASA�s Galileo spacecraft has confirmed it has reached the inside of Jupiter�s magnetosphere. Direct measurements of the Jupiter system may now begin. Final tuning of the flight path is scheduled for December 2. On December 7, Galileo�s previously deployed atmospheric probe will plunge into Jupiter�s cloud tops and descend into the giant planet on a parachute. An hour after the probe mission is completed, Galileo will begin to fire its onboard rocket beginning a two year mission of close-up studies of the planet�s large moons, Jupiter itself, and the magnetosphere. The spacecraft was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis and an Interim Upper Stage (IUS) on October 18, 1989.

NASA has selected four companies to enter into negotiations for the X-33 and X-34 reusable launch systems. Around the end of the decade, the results of the X-33 competition and subsequent flight demonstration could lead to a decision to develop an operational next-generation reusable launch system. The X-34 booster will demonstrate advanced technologies that may apply to reusable launch systems and provide significantly reduced mission costs for placing small payloads into low Earth orbit. The three X-33 selectees are: Lockheed Advanced Development Co.; McDonnell Douglas Aerospace; and Rockwell International Corp., Space Systems Division. The X-34 selectee is Orbital Sciences Corp., Dulles, Virginia. After tests are completed in 1999, it would be up to the aerospace industry to build and operate any new rockets.

NASA scientists expressed concern about space trash from spent satellites and burned out rocket boosters that pose a hazard to functioning satellites and space shuttles. Instead of attempting to collect such debris, NASA has been concentrating on preventing its further buildup by programming satellites and boosters to spiral into the atmosphere and burn up harmlessly. In the future, however, NASA may take a closer look at the possibility of retrieving space debris. At that point, the research of Kumar Ramohalli, formerly of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was attempting to develop a debris retrieving satellite, should be useful. (CSM, Jan 9/95)
