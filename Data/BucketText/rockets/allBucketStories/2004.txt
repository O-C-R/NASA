NASA launched its Gravity Probe B (GP-B) on a Boeing Delta 2 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 12:57 p.m. (EDT). NASA had designed the satellite to test two fundamental aspects of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. According to Einstein’s theory, time and space create a veritable fabric in space. When massive objects, such as Earth and other planets, distort the fabric of space, causing relatively smaller objects to move towards them, they create gravity. Einstein’s theory of relativity also states that large objects twist the fabric of space around them as those objects spin on their axes. Gravity Probe A, which NASA had launched in 1975, had tested the former part of the theory, and GP-B would test both aspects. GP-B contained some of the most accurate scientific instruments ever constructed, including the most precise gyroscopes ever built.
A privately funded rocket called SpaceShipOne became the first vehicle to complete a flight for the commercial spaceflight competition known as the Ansari X Prize. The X Prize competition would award US$10 million to the first private organization to create a spacecraft transporting a pilot and payload, with the equivalent weight of two passengers, to an altitude of 100 kilometers (62.1 miles) above Earth’s surface, twice in two weeks. California-based Scaled Composites had built SpaceShipOne, and the company’s founder Burt Rutan had designed the vehicle. The spacecraft left California’s Mojave Airport at 7:11 a.m. (PST), affixed to another aircraft. The aircraft released SpaceShipOne after attaining an altitude of 48,000 feet (9.1 miles or 14.6 kilometers). Although SpaceShipOne had some difficulty during its ascent, the vehicle’s pilot Michael W. Melvill was able to guide the vehicle to a peak altitude of 337,500 feet (63.9 miles or 102.9 kilometers). However, Scaled Composites would have to repeat the feat within the subsequent two weeks to win the Ansari X Prize.(Scaled Composites, “SpaceShipOne Surpasses 100 Km Altitude on First X-Prize Flight,” news release, 29 September 2004; Peter Pae, “Craft Rolls On into Space in Bid for Prize,” Los Angeles Times, 30 September 2004. 690 X PRIZE Foundation, “Ansari X PRIZE,” http://space.xprize.org/ansari-x-prize (accessed 12 May 2009); Scaled Composites, “SpaceShipOne Captures X-Prize,” 4 October 2004, http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/041004_spaceshipone_x-prize_flight_2.html (accessed 12 May 2009); John Schwartz, “Private Rocket Ship Earns $10 Million in New Space Race,” New York Times, 5 October 2004.)
A piloted rocket called SpaceShipOne reached the highest altitude ever attained by a privately funded vehicle. After its release from a plane flying over the Mojave Desert in California, the winged rocket flew to an altitude of 211,400 feet (40 miles or 64 kilometers). The vehicle’s pilot Michael W. Melvill landed SpaceShipOne at Mojave Airport. The event was a test flight in preparation for the planned official launch of SpaceShipOne on 2 June 2004. Scaled Composites, the company that had built the rocket, intended SpaceShipOne to become the first privately funded, piloted vehicle to achieve suborbital flight. Scaled Composites had built SpaceShipOne for use in commercial spaceflightsspaceflights in which customers pay a fee for a brief trip to outer space.(Peter Pae, “In Capital Venture, Rocket Reaches the Edge of Space,” Los Angeles Times, 14 May 2004; Scaled Composites, “Historic Space Launch Attempt Scheduled for June 21,” news release, 2 June 2004, http://www.scaled.com/projects/tierone/062104.htm (accessed 27 March 2009).)
Engineers at NASA’s SSC successfully completed the first test of the redesigned Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). NASA planned to use the redesigned SSME in the first Shuttle mission after the Columbia tragedy―the mission that NASA often called the Return to Flight Mission. The test of the SSME lasted for 520 seconds, the amount of time a Space Shuttle requires to reach orbit. Each Space Shuttle has three SSMEs―reusable rocket engines capable of generating 400,000 pounds (181,000 kilograms) of thrust.(NASA, “Engineers Test the First Engine for NASA’s Return to Flight Mission,” news release 04-231, 19 July 2004.)
Japan’s Mobile Broadcast Corporation and South Korea’s Sun Kyung Telecom launched the Loral Mobile Broadcasting Satellite (MBSAT), which the two companies had designed to provide the world’s first digital multimedia broadband broadcasting system. The MBSAT, launched on a Lockheed Martin Atlas 3 rocket, carried a 40-foot-diameter (12.2-meter-diameter) antenna designed to provide audio, video, and data services to users of portable audio and visual devices in Japan and South Korea. International Launch Services (ILS), a U.S.-Russian private company, provided the launch services for the Japanese-South Korean joint venture.(Craig Covault, “Mobile Milestone,” Aviation Week and Space Technology 160, no. 12 (22 March 2004): 35; International Launch Services, “About Us,” http://www.ilslaunch.com/about-us/ (accessed 18 March 2009).)
NASA’s X-43A research vehicle established an unofficial world speed record for aircraft of nearly 7,000 miles per hour (11,265 kilometers per hour) or Mach 10―10 times the speed of sound. The X-43A contained an experimental engine―called a supersonic combustion ramjet or scramjet. The scramjet engine had no moving parts and did not use fuel from an on-board tank, as is the case with rockets. Instead, the engine used oxygen from the atmosphere, passing through the vehicle, to ignite fuel. NASA had explored the use of scramjets as an alternative to rocket power for space-access vehicles, with the hope that scramjet vehicles would operate more like an airplane than a rocket. The mission lifted off from NASA’s DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 2:30 p.m. (PST). A NASA B-52 carried the unpiloted X-43A to an altitude of 40,000 feet (7.6 miles or 12.2 kilometers). Before the X-43A had attained at an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers), a Pegasus rocket booster launched from the B-52, providing an initial acceleration that enabled the X-43A to attain an altitude of 111,000 feet (21 miles or 33.8 kilometers). The experimental aircraft flew for nearly 10 seconds at that altitude before descending into the Pacific Ocean as planned, nearly 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) off the coast of California.(John Johnson, “X-43A Aircraft Sets Speed Record at 6,500 MPH,” Los Angeles Times, 17 November 2004; NASA, “NASA’s X-43A Scramjet Breaks Speed Record,” news release 04-373, 16 November 2004.)
Brazil successfully launched its first rocket from the Alcântara launch site in the state of Maranhão. The two-stage rocket called the Veículo de Sondagem Booster-30 (VSB- 30)―Spanish for Sounding Booster Vehicle―was 12.6 meters (41.3 feet) long, had a total mass of 2,570 kilograms (5,666 pounds), and was capable of carrying a payload of up to 400 kilograms (882 pounds). According to Brazilian officials, the government expected to sell up to 15 of the rockets to ESA.(Los Angeles Times, “Brazil Succeeds in Sending First Rocket to Space,” 24 October 2004; Agénica Espacial Brasileira [Brazilian Space Agency], “Foguetes de Sondagem [Survey of Rockets],” http://www.aeb.gov.br/indexx.php?secao=lancadores (accessed 14 November 2009).)
NASA’s X-43A Hyper X plane set a new record for flight speed, traveling at Mach 7, which is nearly 5,000 miles (8,050 kilometers) per hour and seven times the speed of sound. The flight was also the first free flight of an aircraft powered by a supersonic combustion ramjet enginea scramjeta type of engine that provides thrust by funneling air and fuel into a hollow chamber at extremely high speed. The 12-foot-long (3.7-meter-long) unpiloted, experimental aircraft flew for approximately 11 seconds over the Pacific Ocean, at an altitude of 95,000 feet (approximately 29,000 meters), before NASA deliberately landed the aircraft in the ocean. NASA used a modified B-52 aircraft to carry the X-43A into the sky, launching the X-43A into flight using a Pegasus rocket mounted to the B-52. The test flight, which took place near San Nicolas Island off the California coast, originated from NASA’s DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base in California.(Peter Pae, “Fast Times at 12 O’Clock High: 5,000 MPH,” Los Angeles Times, 28 March 2004; NASA, “X-43A Soars on Scramjet Power,” 27 March 2004.)
ESA launched the Rosetta comet probe on an Ariane 5 rocket at 7:17 a.m. (UT) from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. ESA had created Rosettathe first spacecraft designed to enter
Donald R. Puddy, longtime NASA Flight Director who had supervised numerous human spaceflight missions, died at the age of 67 in Houston, Texas. Born in Oklahoma, Puddy had joined NASA’s JSC in 1964 and had spent 22 years at JSC’s Mission Control Center. Puddy was only the 10th person to become a NASA flight director. He had later served in many other positions at NASA’s JSC, ARC, and Headquarters. As JSC Flight Director, Puddy had led flight- control teams during the Apollo Program, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and the Skylab missions, as well as serving as Flight Director for the first Space Shuttle mission. He had also created and managed projects related to aircraft-safety procedures and had played a significant role in early cooperative efforts between the space programs of the United States and the U.S.S.R. Among the numerous awards Puddy had received for his achievements were the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal.(Mark Carreau, “Donald Puddy, Veteran NASA Flight Director,” Houston Chronicle, 24 November 2004; NASA JSC, “NASA Honors Memory of Mission Control Veteran Don Puddy,” news release J04-054, 23 November 2004.)
The Russian Space Agency launched Progress-M 51/ISS-16P, an automatic cargo vehicle, on a Soyuz-U rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 10:19 p.m. (GMT). Progress-M 51, bound for the ISS, carried 2.75 tons (2,500 kilograms or 2.5 tonnes) of equipment, fuel, food, and water.
