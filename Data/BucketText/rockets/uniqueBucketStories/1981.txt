WFC reported the launch of a coordinated balloon, plane, and rocket experiment to study electric fields in thunderstorms. Five vehicles simultaneously measured the fields from troposphere to ionosphere for a number of firsts: first multiple flight of electric-field devices, first simultaneous direct observations of ionosphere lightning, and first measures of lightning waveforms in the stratosphere.
