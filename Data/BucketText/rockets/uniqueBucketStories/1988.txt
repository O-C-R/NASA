NASA successfully launched the first of three suborbital rocket experiments to study Supernova 1987A. The rocket, launched from the Woomera, Australia Range, carried an Xray spectrometer that observed Xray emissions in the 0.37 keV band. Two additional rocket experiments were scheduled for launch during a window lasting until March 20. An earlier series of sounding rocket observations of Supernova 1987A were conducted from Woomera during November and December 1987. Both campaigns used Black Brant IX twostage, solidfuel rockets.

NASA and the Missiles Division of LTV Missiles and Electronic Group, Dallas, Texas, announced the signing of an agreement that would grant the firm exclusive rights to commercially produce and market the Scout launch vehicle. NASA considered the negotiation of the agreement as another important advance in establishing a strong U.S. commercial launch vehicle industry through the privatization of Government expendable rocket programs.
