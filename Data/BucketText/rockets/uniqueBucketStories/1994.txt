India signed a new agreement to buy seven rocket engines from Russia's commercial space organization, according to U.R. Rao, outgoing head of the Indian Space Research Organisation. The first engine was to be delivered in 1996 and the remainder over a three-year period. (Reuters, Mar 30/94)
NASA reportedly transferred $990,000 to the Defense Department's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to maintain the Delta Clipper program. McDonnell Douglas Aerospace had developed a rocket that takes off and lands vertically, which is covered by this program. NASA wished to keep the option of using the DC-X as a flight demonstrator of single-stage-to-orbit technologies in support of NASA's advanced launch technology effort. The program was operated from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. (RTw, Jan 31/94; H Post, Feb 3/94)
An unmanned DC-X (Delta Clipper Experimental) rocket made an emergency landing at the White Sands Missile Range following a mysterious explosion soon after its engines started. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization developed the missile, and McDonnell Douglas Corporation manufactured it. The flight was the fifth for the unusual rocket, which was made to take off and land vertically. The DC-X was grounded in the fall of 1993 when the project ran out of money. However, NASA came up with enough funds to keep the program going until Congress appropriated $5 million to complete its flight test program. Ultimately the rocket was to be turned over to NASA.

Martin Marietta Corporation announced it would eliminate 1,800 of its 2,100 jobs at its recently acquired space launch business in San Diego. The company planned to move the production of Atlas and Centaur launch systems to its Titan rocket plant in Denver. (LA Times, Jun 17/94)
Some 20 students in the Student Rocket Program at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, built a rocket from scratch over the preceding year and a half. The rocket was to be launched when NASA radar technicians came to Poker Flat for other planned launches. NASA and other U.S. government agencies invested millions of dollars to upgrade 25-year-old Poker Flat, the world's only university-owned rocket range, which had an excellent far northern location. The objective of the rocket flight was technical performance: to get the $20,000 rocket into the Earth's stratosphere and to keep in contact with it during its brief flight by satellite-relayed signals.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered NASA in 1991 to conduct a sitewide investigation of longstanding environmental problems across its 352-acre complex on the western border of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. The problems included dumps containing spent rocket fuel and contamination of soil and water by mercury. To date there was little evidence of progress apart from much discussion of how the eventual cleanup would be done. (Plain Dealer, Oct 16/94)
NASA announced that it had selected the science team for the first spacecraft designed to rendezvous with an asteroid, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission. The NEAR spacecraft was scheduled for launch in February 1996 aboard a Delta 2 rocket and should arrive in orbit around asteroid 433 Eros in early January 1999. It would survey Eros for a minimum of one year, at altitudes as close as 15 miles. The NEAR Science Payload would consist of six instruments: a multispectral imager system, a near-infrared spectrograph, an X-ray/gamma-ray spectrometer, a magnetometer, a laser altimeter, and the spacecraft's radio, which was sued also for gravity measurements. Members of the science team were assigned to each of these instruments. (NASA Release 94-159)
The launch of the H-II (also seen as H-2) rocket created by the Japanese consortium Rocket Systems Corporation was scheduled for February 4. The rocket, large enough to lift a two-ton payload into geostationary orbit, cost $2.5 billion to develop and was two years behind schedule.

Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta Corporation, said the company would not buy General Dynamics Corporation's space-launch business for $208.5 million as planned unless the government agreed to pay more for those services. Martin Marietta wanted a part of the more than $400 million in savings it anticipated that the government could realize over 10 years as a result of Martin Marietta merging its Titan IV heavy-launch rocket business with General Dynamics' medium-lift Atlas-Centaur system. (WSJ, Feb 22/94)
Japan scheduled the launch of the H-2, its first rocket built without U.S. technology, whose development has taken ten years and $2.4 billion. A consortium of 74 Japanese companies built it and formed the Rocket Systems Corporation to market it.

NASA announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Commission for Space Activities of the Federative Republic of Brazil (COBAE). The two parties were to conduct a sounding rocket campaign in Brazil from July through October 1994 to investigate the electrodynamics and irregularities in the ionosphere and mesosphere along the Earth's magnetic equator and study their relationship with the neutral atmosphere and winds. NASA was to launch, with the support of COBAE, 33 rockets from the new Brazilian launch range, Centro de Lan�amentos de Alc�ntara in Maranh�o. Brazilian scientific participation was to be coordinated by the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) and was to be named the Guara Campaign after a lovely bird native to the equatorial region of Brazil.
