A panel investigating the loss of two solid-fuel rocket boosters after the launch of STS-4 said that a switch in the booster decelerators was at fault. Premature separation of one of two riser attachments on each main chute occurred about 365-seconds after liftoff, when the frustrums were exploded away from the booster, instead of at impact with the water. A switch designed to release the chutes when the boosters hit the water had freed the parachutes from the boosters before impact, probably because of severe shock when the explosion separated the frustrum from the boosters. Before STS-5, NASA modified the decelerating system to fix both risers firmly to each booster, to eliminate switch separation, and to prevent shock from affecting other subsystems. The booster deceleration worked perfectly during STS-5. (NASA Release 83-19)
President Reagan issued a directive for the government to rent launch pads and sell rocket parts and plans to private firms as “a domestic backup for the shuttle at essentially no cost to the U.S. government. . . .the private sector would assume all costs of [expendable launch vehicle] production now borne by the U.S. government.” U.S. government facilities and equipment that would otherwise be underutilized or no longer required would find a market. The government began 10 years ago to phase out expendable rockets like Delta, Atlas, and Titan in favor of reusable Space Shuttles. Contracts with rocket firms were ending, and launch pads at the Cape were closing down. Gilbert Rye of the National Security Council said that the costs of keeping the U.S. facilities open and operating would be borne by the private companies. The president’s directive would allow the firms to buy parts and government-owned plans for the rockets at cost and to pay for the use of launch pads, equipment, and engineers.
