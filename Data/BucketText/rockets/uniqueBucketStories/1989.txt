The first commercial launch of a licensed private rocket was successfully carried out at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. A twostage Starfire suborbital rocket built by Space Services, Inc. carried a canister of experiments on a 198mile ballistic trajectory. The experiment canister, which carried several microgravity materials processing experiments, was retrieved intact at the conclusion of the 15minute suborbital flight. Space Systems, Inc. had previously launched a test rocket carrying a dummy payload in 1982.

The Soviet weekly magazine Ogonyok revealed additional details on the circumstances surrounding a mysterious launch pad explosion of a Soviet rocket in 1960 that killed dozens of workers and the commander of the Soviet Union's rocket forces. Ogonyok attributed the accident, which took place at a secret launch facility at TuraTam, near the Aral Sea, to a flouting of safety rules during a crash program to catch up with the United States in the development of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). The head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, Chief Artillery Marshal Mitrofan I. Nedelin, was killed along with dozens of workers and soldiers who were situated near the pad when the rocket exploded.
