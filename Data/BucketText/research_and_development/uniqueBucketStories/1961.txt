Ambassador Adlai Stevenson introduced a resolution before the U.N.’s Political Committee for a U.N. space program guided by four considerations: (1) Application of the principles of international law to outer space and celestial bodies to ensure against sovereignty claims in space; (2) making the U.N. a clearinghouse for use of outer space, including information on satellite launchings and cooperation for peaceful use of outer space; (3) international cooperation on weather satellite information; (4) international cooperation on communications satellites. Ambassador Stevenson said: “There is a right way and a wrong way to get on with the business of space exploration. In our judgment, the wrong way is to allow the march of science to become a runaway race into the unknown. “The right way is to make it an ordered, peaceful and cooperative and constructive forward march under the aegis of the United Nations.”
