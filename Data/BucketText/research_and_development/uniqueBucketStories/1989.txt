NASA announced the selection of three contractors to research possible propulsion systems for the proposed Advance Launch System (ALS). NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama, selected Aerojet General Corporation, Sacramento, California; Pratt and Whitney Division of United0*Technologies Corporation, West Palm Beach, Florida; and Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International, Canoga Park, California, to research ALS designs. The systems definition contract totaled $20 million. The ALS would be a nextgeneration launch system capable of transporting 150,000pound payloads into low Earth orbit. (Def News, Jul 17/89)
Planetary scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California announced the discovery of "ring arcs" orbiting Neptune. NASA scientists noted that, unlike the rings surrounding Saturn, Jupiter, and Uranus, Neptune's rings did not appear to completely surround the planet.

Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, announced that the Voyager 2 space probe had discovered a giant weather system on Neptune approximately 6,200 miles wide and comparable to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Voyager 2 made the discovery while at a distance of 58.98 million miles from Neptune, currently the most distant planet from the Sun. Voyager 2 was scheduled to perform an extremely close flyby of Neptune on August 24, when it would approach to within 3,000 miles of the planet's cloud tops. This would be the fourth and final planetary flyby by Voyager 2, which was launched in 1977 and had flown by Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.

Planetary scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California announced the discovery of three additional moons of Neptune, bringing the total number of Neptune's known moons to six. The moons, designated 1989 N2, 1989 N3, and 1989 N4, ranged between 60 and 125 miles in diameter and were found to be in normal equatorial orbits in the direction of the planet's rotation. Prior0*to Voyager's observations, only two moons of Neptune had been observed. (NASA Release 89128, Aug 3/89; NY Times, Aug 4/89; W Post, Aug 4/89; LA Times, Aug 4/89;
Threetime space flight veteran George "Pinky" Nelson announced he would leave NASA on June 30 to accept academic and administrative positions at the University of Washington, Seattle. (NASA Release 8989, Jun 9/89)
Challenging earlier reports that a mysterious object at the heart of the remnants of Supernova 1987A is a rapidly spinning pulsar, scientists at Columbia University announced that the observed object was more likely to be a vibrating neutron star. The debate over the nature of the object began in February when astronomers at the University of California at Berkeley theorized0*that they were observing an extremely dense pulsar rotating at 2,000 rotations per second. The Berkeley announcement prompted astronomers at Columbia University to argue that the observed bursts of radiation were more likely to emanate from a less dense neutron star that is vibrating at the observed frequency. The Columbia astronomers argued that the vibration theory not only explained the recent observations but also was consistent with previous hypotheses on how neutron stars develop. (W Post, Mar
Scientists at NASA's solar system exploration division announced that the Earth had experienced a "close call" in March with a newly discovered halfmilewide asteroid. The asteroid, named 1989FC, passed within 500,000 miles of Earthabout twice the distance to the Moonon March 23. The asteroid was discovered by Henry Holt, an amateur astronomer working on a NASA asteroid hunting project. NASA scientists estimated that if the asteroid were ever to collide with the Earth, the collision would release energy equivalent to 20,000 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and would leave a crater 10 miles wide and up to a mile deep.

While heading toward a close approach of Neptune, the Voyager 2 space probe discovered the first complete ring around the planet. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, had previously observed several ring arcs. The discovery of the complete ring around Neptune had been expected0*based on observations of rings on the other three large outer planets during previous Voyager planetary encounters.

A NASA ER2 high altitude aircraft flew the first of a dozen scientific missions over the arctic circle to document the depletion of the Earth's atmospheric ozone layer around the North Pole. The project, a joint U.S.European effort, involved over 150 scientists engaged in research on ozone depletion caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other manmade chemicals.
