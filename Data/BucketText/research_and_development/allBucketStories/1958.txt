A NASA Space Task Group organized ut I.angley Research Center drew up specifications for the Mercury capsule, bused on studies by tbe National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics during the preceding 12 mouths, and on discussions with the Air Force which bad been conducting related studies.
First vacuum tank for use in ion and plasma electric propulsion research received at NASA Lewis Research Center, three more of which were later put to research, and two large models to be completed by 1962. During 1958: NASA Langley research scientists, Paul Purser and Maxima Fa-get, conceived Little Joe research rocket; the Scout vehicle system was conceived from PARD�s multistage hypersonic solid-propellant rocket program.
USAF revealed that an airflow specd of 32,400 mph had becn attained for one-tenth of a second in a wind tunnel test at the Arnold Engineering Development Center, Tullahoma, Tenn., on an undisclosed date.
Federal CouncU for Science and Technology to be headed by Dr. Juines R. Killian, Jr., was approved by President Elsenhower.

During June: Space Science Board of 10 members established by National Academy of Sciences, with Dr. Lloyd V. Berk-ner as Chairman, to advise and assist In formulation of U.S. post-IGY space research program and to foster cooperation with space scientists In other nations.
NACA Issued a staff study entitled �A National Research Program . for Space Technology.�

Dr. Abe Sllverstcln, Associate Director of Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, was transferred to NACA head-ilimrters to help plan the organization mid programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, subsequently becoming Director of the Office of Space Flight Programs.
Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration of the House of Representatives opened hearings on outer space leading toward formulation of a national space program.
President Eisenhower signed H.It. 12575, mAking it the Notional Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (Public Lnw 85-568). In his statement, he said: �The present Natlonnl Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) with Its large and competent staff and well-equipped laboratories will provide tbe nucleus for NASA. Tbe NACA has an established record of research performance and of cooiicratlon with the armed services. The coordination of space exploration responsibilities with NACA�s traditional aeronautical research functions Is a natural evolution . . . [one which] should have an even greater Impact on our future.�
Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology reported that initial data from EXPLORER I showed that cosmic radiation on its orbit did not exceed 12 times the amount on earth.
NASA Lewis Research Center completed 14 years of extensive research on all U.S. turbojet engines.
