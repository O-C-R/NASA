Challenging earlier reports that a mysterious object at the heart of the remnants of Supernova 1987A is a rapidly spinning pulsar, scientists at Columbia University announced that the observed object was more likely to be a vibrating neutron star. The debate over the nature of the object began in February when astronomers at the University of California at Berkeley theorized0*that they were observing an extremely dense pulsar rotating at 2,000 rotations per second. The Berkeley announcement prompted astronomers at Columbia University to argue that the observed bursts of radiation were more likely to emanate from a less dense neutron star that is vibrating at the observed frequency. The Columbia astronomers argued that the vibration theory not only explained the recent observations but also was consistent with previous hypotheses on how neutron stars develop. (W Post, Mar
President George Bush announced the selection of Rear Admiral Richard H. Truly, a former astronaut and head of the Space Shuttle program, to succeed Dr. James C. Fletcher as NASA Administrator. The White House also announced that J.R. Thompson, Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Huntsville, Alabama, would be appointed NASA Deputy Administrator. Truly, a veteran of two Shuttle flights, was named to head the Shuttle program by Administrator Fletcher following the 1986 Challenger0*accident. Truly was credited with helping to restore safety and reliability to Shuttlerelated activities.

The Space Shuttle Atlantis was successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, on mission STS34 to0*deploy the $1.4 billion Galileo Jupiter space probe. The Atlantis launch had been delayed by a week because of problems with a computer, a main engine master control device, and, finally, rain. Shortly after reaching orbit, Atlantis released the Galileo probe and the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) from the cargo bay. The IUS subsequently fired Galileo on a trajectory toward Venus, in preparation for a gravity assist maneuver that would swing the spacecraft back toward Earth twice and onward to Jupiter. Galileo was scheduled to reach Jupiter in December 1995, whereupon it would begin orbiting the planet for 22 months of observations of the Jovian system. Approximately five months before reaching Jupiter, Galileo would release a 34inch unpowered descent module that would enter the Jovian upper atmosphere and descend several hundred miles before being destroyed by extreme atmospheric pressure. The AtlantisGalileo mission had sparked protests and a law suit by antinuclear groups concerned over the danger of possible radioactive contamination from the probe's radioisotope thermal generators in the event of a catastrophic accident. In anticipation of possible efforts to disrupt the launch, NASA increased security measures at KSC. In addition to launching Galileo, the STS34 crew would conduct observations of the Earth's ozone layer and perform several onboard medical, biological, and materials processing experiments. The crew included Navy Captain Donald E. Williams (Commander), Navy Commander Michael J. McCulley (Pilot), and Mission Specialists Shannon Lucid, Franklin Changaz, and Ellen S. Baker. The mission ended successfully on October 23 with Atlantis landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

NASA scientists reported that a group of eight newly fertilized chicken embryos carried aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS28 had failed to hatch upon returning to Earth, raising questions about the viability of animal reproduction in zero gravity. A group of 16 eggs fertilized nine days before launch were all successfully hatched. Of a third group of eight eggs scheduled to hatch Saturday, only a few embryos remained viable. Discovery astronaut James Bagian speculated that the results may indicate that gravity plays a previously unknown critical role during the process of cell differentiation. Bagian suggested that, should the experiment demonstrate a relationship between gravity and embryogenesis, the results would have "great0*implications" for future longduration space missions.

Planetary scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) confirmed that the Voyager 2 space probe had discovered a third moon orbiting Neptune. The moon, temporarily designated 1989 N1, was estimated to be between 125 and 400 miles in diameter and to be in a nearcircular orbit 57,600 miles above Neptune's equator. Additionally, JPL announced that a pair of dark atmospheric bands had been discovered around Neptune's south pole. The scientists compared the 2,700 milewide belts to jet streams on Earth and to the belts seen around Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. The photograph showing the south pole bands also revealed evidence of comparable bands around Neptune's north pole.

The Space Shuttle Atlantis was successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on mission STS30, whose main objective was to deploy the $550 million Magellan Venus radar mapper. Magellan, the first United States interplanetary mission to' 0*be launched in 11 years, was deployed from the cargo bay of Atlantis 6 hours after launch and was subsequently propelled toward the Sun and Venus by a solid fuel inertial upper stage (IUS). Following the IUS firing, ground controllers confirmed that the spacecraft was operating normally and was on a proper course toward Venus. Upon arriving at Venus in August 1990, the 7,700pound Magellan would enter Venusian orbit for several months of extensive radar mapping of the planet's cloud shrouded surface.

Scientists at NASA's solar system exploration division announced that the Earth had experienced a "close call" in March with a newly discovered halfmilewide asteroid. The asteroid, named 1989FC, passed within 500,000 miles of Earthabout twice the distance to the Moonon March 23. The asteroid was discovered by Henry Holt, an amateur astronomer working on a NASA asteroid hunting project.

The Space Shuttle Discovery was successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on mission STS29, the main objective to deploy the final Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS4). Discovery carried a crew of five on a 5day mission. Six hours into the mission, the 2.5 ton $100 million TDRS4 was successfully deployed into low Earth orbit where it subsequently boosted itself into a 22,300 mile geosynchronous orbit. Discovery also carried biological experiments that to conduct studies of the embryonic development of chickens and bone healing in rats in a microgravity environment. The STS28 crew would also photograph and film environmentally damaged areas throughout the world for later scientific analysis. Discovery's launch had been delayed a month because of cracks found in the main engine turbopumps. Replacement occurred on the launch pad. During the mission, a hydrogen tank supplying the Shuttle's fuel cells was temporarily shut down because of erratic pressure readings.

A report by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) entitled "Round Trip to Orbit: Human Space Flight Alternatives" recommended construction of a fifth Space Shuttle orbiter or a Shuttlederived launch vehicle in preparation for the Space Station assembly missions of the late 1990s. Citing estimates of Space Shuttle reliability of 97 to 99 percent, OTA warned that there was an 88 percent likelihood that another Shuttle orbiter would be lost before Space Station construction is completed. The OTA report stated: "Buying more orbiters would increase the resiliency of the Space Shuttle system...[and] its ability to recover rapidly from loss of another orbiter or any other event that delays launches. The Shuttle orbiter fleet is likely to continue to suffer occasional attrition." (AP, Aug 2/89; UPI, Aug 2/89; W Post, Aug

Astronomers from the University of California at Berkeley announced the possible discovery of a newborn pulsar at the heart of stellar debris from Supernova 1987a. A pulsar is an extremely dense sphere of neutrons less than a few miles in diameter but with a magnetic field trillions of times more powerful than the Earth's.
