Economy moves left Kennedy Space Center dangerously short on fire protection, according to Jack N. Anderson and Les Whitten in a Washington Post article. The Center was being protected between 3:00 pm and 7:00 am by eight on-duty fire fighters, not enough to man the $750 000 worth of fire equipment or fight a conflagration, they said. The 3 237 500-sq-km facility contained 3747 cu m of liquid oxygen, 3028 cu m of liquid hydrogen, and rocket fuel “to stoke .a flash fire.” Boeing Co., which held the icsc fire protection contract, planned to lay off 21 firemen and shift others to lower paying jobs. A Boeing spokesman had said no manned missions were planned until 1975 and the base was adequately protected. The Post quoted a NASA spokesman as saying that the cuts were necessary and that additional fire fighting help was only five minutes away. (W Post, 11 Feb 74, B13)
Computer enhancement of multispectral photographs from Erts 1 satellite (circling the earth since 23 July 1972) had been proved useful for finding mineral and water deposits on the earth. Computer image enhancement, first used at Jet Propulsion Laboratory to improve early spacecraft pictures of the moon and Mars, had identified surface signs of known mineral deposits for JPL and U.S. Geological Survey investigators. Twenty ERTS-identified points had been verified in a test area, exploratory drilling had uncovered water-bearing rock 12 m below an ERTS-indicated water hole, and fractures indicating other drilling sites had been revealed, (nasa 74-27)
NASA announced the appointment of J. Lloyd Jones as Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics Technology in the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology. Jones had been Director of the Aerodynamics and Vehicle Systems Div. in OAST since 1972, when he had come to NASA Hq. from Ames Research Center. He had been at arc since 1954. In an OAST reorganization providing for two deputies instead of one, Deputy Associate Administrator for Technology Robert E. Smylie became Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Technology, (nasa Release 74—187)
President Nixon sent a $304.4-billion FY 1975 U.S. budget request to Congress, an increase of $29.8 billion over FY 1974- With 90% of the increase mandatory under existing law, the budget included few new programs and few cuts. Federal funds for research and development would increase by 9% from FY 1974, to $19.8 billion total obligations, “reflecting recognition of the larger potential contribution of science and technology to the solution of critical national problems.” A substantial increase- was requested for energy r&d, $2.05 billion in FY 1975 from $942 million in FY 1974. The FY 1975 r&d request proposed investment in priority national needs, but included basic research as well as efforts to speed the use of federally sponsored r&d. The non-Federal investment in r&d was expected to be $16 billion, 45% of a national total of $36 billion. nasa’s total budget request of $3,247 billion was $245 million above the FY 1974 appropriation and $96.2 million above the 1974 budget plan. If approved, the increase would be NASA’s first since 1965, except for a $100-million FY 1973 increase that the agency had not been permitted to spend. Significant budget items are shown in the table. The Dept, of Defense FY 1975 budget request of $85.8 billion included $9.3 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation, an increase NASA FY 1975 Budget Highlights (in thousands; items do not add to program totals because only selected items are listed) Budget Item FY 1974 FY 1975 FY 1975 Authorization Request Difference Total budget authority $3 054 500 $3 247 129 +$192 629 (3 002 100 appropriation) (+245 029) Research and development 2 245 500 (2 194 000 2 346 015 +100 515 appropriation) (+152 015) Manned space flight 1 032 000 1 124 800 +92 800 Space shuttle 475 000 800 000 +325 000 Space flight operations 555 500 323 300 -232 200 Skylab 233 800 — -233 800 ASTP 90 000 114 600 +24 600 Development, test & operations 220 200 175 200 -45 800 Space life sciences 21 000 18 000 -3 000 Space sciences 552 000 547 015 -4 985 Physics & astronomy 63 600 140 515 +76 915 OSO (un- 7 630 OAO dis- 2 380 heao (suspended 1974) trib- 40 400 Orbiting Explorers uted) 33 000 Large Space Telescope — 6 200 +6 200 Lunar & planetary 311 000 266 000 -45 000 Viking (un* 89 016 Mariner Jupiter-Saturn 1977 dis* 69 761 Pioneer Venus (new start 1975) trib- 27 100 Helios uted) 1 400 Lunar sample analysis 5 798 Lunar science operations 4 333 Launch vehicle procurement 177 400 140 500 -36 900 Space applications $161 000 $177 500 +$16 500 Weather and climate 51 100 35 000 -16 100 Nimbus 5 & F fun- 7 000 Tiros-N dis- 9 000 SMS-A & -B trib- 1 400 GABP uted) 7 400 Pollution monitoring 13 900 29 800 +15 900 Earth resources'survey 49 600 58 600 +9 000 EHTS-B (on dis- 11 100 Aircraft survey tributed) 17 300 Earth and ocean physics 10 700 18 500 +7 800 SEASAT-A — . 8 000 +8 000 Space processing 3 100 3 500 +400 Energy applications 2 000 2 000 — Communications satellites 22 100 8 300 -13 800 Heat Capacity Mapping Mission — 2 600 +2 600 Aeronautics & space technology 252 000 241 200 -10 800 Aeronautical 180 000 166 400 -13 600 Space & nuclear 72 000 74 800 +2 800 Tracking & data acquisition 244 000 250 000 +6 000 Technology utilization 4 500 5 500 +1 000 Construction of facilities 112 000 151 490 +39 490 (101 100 (+50 390) Infrared telescope facility, Hawaii — 6 040 +6 040 X-ray telescope facility, msfc — 4 060 +4 060 Space shuttle facilities 67 200 86 020 +18 820 Research & program management 707 000 749 624 +42 624 (707 000 (+42 624) DOD FY 1975 KDT&E Budget Highlights (in thousands; items do not add to program totals because only selected items are listed) Budget Item FY 1974 Budget Plan FY 1975 Budget Plan FY 1975 Difference Research, development, test, & evaluation £8 333 009 £9 322 469 +3989 460 Military astronautics 593 926 527 248 -66 678 Aircraft 1 682 381 1 829 318 +146 937 B-l advanced strategic bomber 449 000 499 000 +50 000 A-10 close-air-support aircraft 107 000 268 000 +161 000 AF air combat ighter — 36 000 -36 000 usn vfx fighter prototype — 34 000 -34 000 Tanker/missile-carrier aircraft — 20 000 -20 000 Advanced medium stol transport (amst) 25 000 56 000 -31 000 F-14 interceptor aircraft 737 000 756 000 -19 000 F—15 air superiority fighter 1 129 000 1 076 000 -53 000 Missiles 2 124 762 2,352 993 +228 231 Trident missile 528 000 649 000 +121 000 Air-launched cruise missile 11 000 80 000 +69 000 Submarine-launched cruise missile 3 000 45 000 +42 000 Advanced icbm technology 4 000 37 000 +33 000 Minuteman-site-defense prototype development 110 000 160 000 +50 000 Terminally guided maneuvering reentry vehicle (marv) — 20 000 +20 000 of $989.5 million from the FY 1974 budget plan.

John H. Disher, Skylab Program Deputy Director since August 1965, had been named Director of Advanced Programs in NASA’s Office of Manned Space Flight, NASA announced. Skylab had concluded operations with the 8 Feb. splashdown of its third manned mission to visit the Nation’s first experimental space station. In the Advanced Program Office, Disher would head evaluations of concepts for manned space activities within changing national needs and priorities, to guide transition from present to future programs. From 1959 to 1961 Disher had headed advanced manned missions. He had also served as Apollo Test Director and Assistant Director for Apollo Spacecraft Development, (nasa Release 74-48)
In an effort toward accurate earthquake prediction, antennas at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goldstone Tracking Station—200 km apart and on either side of the San Andreas Fault—were receiving radio signals from quasars outside the galaxy. As part of jpl’s Astronomical Radio Interferometric Earth Surveying (aries) project, techniques developed for spacecraft navigation could measure the precise distance between the antennas by monitoring the arrival times of identical radio signals, accurate to one tenth of a billionth of a second. Changes in the times could indicate three-dimensional shifts in the earth’s crust up to an initial accuracy of 10 cm, with an eventual accuracy goal of 2 cm. Scientists hoped that ARIES techniques would help prove the theory that earthquakes were preceded by a swelling of the earth’s surface up to one meter over hundreds of square kilometers and provide a maj or new tool in earthquake research and prediction, (jpl Release 710; jpl proj off, interview, 3 Dec 75)
Aircraft stalls and spins, greatest cause of fatal general-aviation accidents, had been intensively studied for the past 18 mos, NASA said in a report on its general-aviation technology program. More than 1000 spin tests had been made in Langley Research Center’s spin tunnel; designs for test aircraft were nearly complete. Airport traffic flow and pilot ap-proach-and-landing performance also were under study, and a program offering more precise flight path control and reduced pilot workload had significantly improved pilot landing ability. A five-year program was developing better training methodology to reduce pilot errors. (nasa Fact Sheet) May 1974
First evidence of water molecules in a comet had been identified in the tail of Comet Kohoutek by Canadian scientists Dr. Gerhard Herz-berg and Dr. Hin Lew, both of Canada’s National Research Council, NASA announced. Dr. Herzberg and Dr. Lew identified the molecules by analyzing emissions of light at five wavelengths in the red region of the comet’s spectrum, where the positively charged molecules, ionized by solar radiation, were pushed by the solar wind. Data had been collected by telescopes at Asiago Astrophysical Observatory in Italy and Univ. of California’s Lick Observatory in October and November 1973. The discovery of hydrogen in the comet supported the “dirty snowball” theory that comets might be composed of an icy nucleus, various other frozen gases, and tiny dust particles as proposed by Dr. Fred L. Whipple, retired Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and principal consultant to NASA on comets, (nasa Release 73 [74]—13)

Schneider and the three Skylab crews had been selected as recipients of the 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy for “proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on earth,” the National Aeronautic Association announced. The Collier Committee—while recognizing contributions to the Skylab program by the more than 26000 engineers, scientists, flight controllers, and technicians—also had unanimously agreed that the trophy should be presented to Schneider on behalf of the crews for his leadership in this “exceedingly complex enterprise.” The trophy was presented by Vice President Gerald R. Ford in Washington, D.C., ceremonies 4 June. (naa News, April 74)
Roy E. Anderson, General Electric Co. Research and Development Center engineer, demonstrated the potential of geostationary satellites for search-and-rescue missions. Standing on the NASA Hq. steps in Washington, D.C., and using an ordinary walkie-talkie aided by an antenna built on the frame of a golfer’s umbrella, Anderson beamed a message to GE’s Radio-Optical Observatory in Schenectady, N.Y., via NASA’s Ats 3 Applications Technology Satellite. The inexpensive, 1.4-kg antenna increased the normal eight-kilometer range of the walkie-talkie more than 10 000 times. Anderson suggested that a global search-and-rescue system, covering all but the polar regions, would require only six geostationary satellites. The necessary transponder could be attached to any communications satellite and would draw only a small portion of the satellite’s power. (GE Release, 2 Oct 74; AP, B Sun, 3 Oct 74, A3)
Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue had experienced a harrowing last hour in space when they could not get commands to the secondary control system, which pointed the spacecraft heat shield at the correct angle during reentry. After discovering a leak in the prime reaction control system, the astronauts tried and failed to activate the secondary system. “Our hearts fell and our eyeballs popped,” Carr said at a 22 Feb. Johnson Space Center press conference. Carr, commander of the mission, instead had used a manual procedure to bypass the computer controlling the engine’s firing and guided the spacecraft to a safe on-target splashdown. The press later quoted a NASA spokesman as saying that the failure to activate the backup control system was “just a matter of a switch not being thrown.” (O’Toole, W Post, 15 Feb 74, Al; upi, Richmond Times-Dispatch, 16 Feb 74; Maloney, H Post, 23 Feb 74)
A new medical device, the mobile automatic metabolic analyzer (mama) developed from Apollo and Skylab technology to measure energy expended by ambulatory patients, was presented to the Univ. of Alabama Medical School by Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Director of Marshall Space Flight Center.

Preliminary results of the 18—26 Dec. 1973 Soyuz 13 mission were published in Izvestiya. The two crew members of the “orbiting astrophysical observatory” had made 10 000 spectrograms with the Orion 2 telescope, recording emissions of stars in ultraviolet. Remote luminaries up to 12th stellar magnitude had been recorded. The biomass of the microbe culture in the Oasis 2 experimental closed-cycle biological system had increased more than 35 times during the mission. [Izvestiya, fbis—Sov, 5 March 74, U1)
Kennedy Space Center had awarded a $382 000 contract to General Electric Co. for a multispectral-image-analysis system for data from the Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (in orhit since 23 July 1972), from Skylab’s earth resources experiment package (carried on the Orbital Workshop in 1973), and from remote-sensing aircraft, (ksc Release 80-74)
A digital computing cardiotachometer developed for monitoring beattobeat heart rates of astronauts training underwater was being used in two Birmingham, Ala., hospitals, Marshall Space Flight Center announced.

A numerical display showed the subject’s pulse rate 0.3 sec after detecting his second heart beat, (msfc Release 74-140)
Analyses of light flashes seen by crew members of the last Apollo missions, tentatively attributed to cosmic ray nuclei penetrating the head and eyes, were reported by Univ. of Houston and Johnson Space Center scientists in Science magazine. Three kinds of flashes—the spot or star-like flash, the streak, and the cloud—had occurred randomly, with no apparent preference for one eye over the other. Astronauts saw many more flashes during translunar coast experiment sessions than in transearth coast, although the cosmic ray flux appeared to be the same inside the spacecraft during both coasts. No physiological explanation was found for this difference in frequency of flashes. (Pinsky, et al., Science, 8 March 74, 957-958)
The Navy had selected International Business Machines Corp. Electronic Systems Center as prime contractor for the light airborne multipurpose system (lamps) helicopter, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. Under a $13.8-million contract, IBM would develop and test a prototype antisubmarine warfare and avionics and weapon control system for installation and integration in a helicopter furnished by the Navy. (Av Wk, 8 April 74,24) 8 April-3 May: Some 75 Soviet aerospace specialists—including U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Technical Director Konstantin D. Bushuyev, prime crewmen Aleksey A. Leonov and Valery N. Kubasov, Flight Director Aleksey S. Yeliseyev, and training officer for astp crews Valery F. Bykovsky—joined U.S. astp astronauts and specialists at Johnson Space Center to continue technical discussions and planning for the July 1975 joint astp mission. Agreement was reached that specialists and flight crews would visit the U.S. launch site in February 1975 and the U.S.S.R. launch site in May 1975, for familiarization with the spacecraft and to test compatible equipment. NASA had defined no technical need for U.S. representatives at the Soviet launch site during actual liftoff; U.S. specialists would be in the control center. Apollo docking module and Soyuz life-support-system tests were reviewed, in addition to safety assessment reports on control systems and spacecraft manufacturing test and checkout. Schedules for each of the five joint experiments—ultraviolet absorption, biological interaction, microbial exchange, multipurpose furnace, and artificial solar eclipse— were approved. Agreement was also reached on the basic approach and content of the joint flight readiness review, to be held in May 1975. The U.S.S.R. crew and U.S. astp Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, Vance D. Brand, and Donald K. Slayton walked through hundreds of procedures for the first time as crews, to verify the integrity of the docking module that would connect the Soyuz and Apollo command and service modules. At a 26 April press conference Stafford demonstrated his proficiency in the Russian language by answering newsmen’s questions in Russian. Cosmonauts and astronauts agreed that “we’ve no problem in language.” One cosmonaut said, “Our work is considerably better when the American crew speaks Russian and our crew speaks English.” Glynn S. Lunney, astp Technical Director for the U.S., said during a 3 May press briefing that the work in the U.S. and jointly was on schedule. The progress “has been good and . . . gratifying.” Prof. Bushuyev said that “there can be no longer any doubt that we will be successful in preparing for and achieving our joint flight in July 1975.” (jsc Roundup, 12 April 74, 1; astp Communique; Press briefing transcripts, 26 April 74, 3 May 74)
Dr. George A. Van Biesbroeck, Univ. of Arizona astronomer noted for his work with twin stars, asteroids, and comets, died in Arizona at the age of 94. Dr. Van Biesbroeck had charted the orbit of Neptune’s second satellite, published catalogs of double stars, and discovered 11 asteroids and 2 comets. In the 1930s he had been instrumental in establishing the McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Tex. Dr. Van Biesbroeck had won the Franklin L. Burr Award from the National Geographic Society in 1952 for finding new proof of the bending of light from stars in support of the Einstein theory of relativity. (AP, NYT, 26 Feb 74, 36) 24 February-1 March: This would be the age we could contact other civilizations, Dr. Frank D. Drake, Cornell Univ. astronomer, told the annual meeting of the American Assn, for the Advancement of Science in San Francisco. The problem was finding ways to detect them. Analysis of data from a 1973 search of 500 stars by Univ. of Maryland and Univ. of Chicago scientists had failed to reveal radio emissions suggestive of other technological civilizations. Possibly “no one is seeking to make radio transmissions” and eavesdropping would be the only method of detection. Project Cyclops, a NASA-supported study proposing construction of a 16-km-wide field of 1400, 91-m antennas, would have a high probability of success if civilization existed within 200 light years. The ultimate $5-billion cost would be less than the Apollo moon landings and would give man a chance to contact the “galactic community.” {NYT, 14 March 74, 15; Salisbury, CSM, 7 March 74) _
A 6.4-cm underwater borehole TV camera to provide geologists views of the earth’s interior layers had been developed from Skylab technology, Marshall Space Flight Center announced. The camera, designed for msfc by Sperry Support Services of Alabama, would permit geologists to study geological formations from the interior of a 7.6-cm-dia survey borehole drilled to a depth of 490 m. Images received by the remotely controlled camera would be transmitted along an armored cable to a standard vidicon receiving tube on the surface, (msfc Release 74—138)
President Nixon wired salutations to Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue aboard the recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans after their successful splashdown at 11:17 am edt. The astronauts, launched 16 Nov. 1973, had set an 84-day space flight record in the Orbital Workshop. The President said: “On behalf of the American people, I salute Skylab’s third crew of astronauts on their safe return to earth. They have successfully completed man’s longest space journey and brought to an end one of the most scientifically productive endeavors in the history of human exploration. From the Skylab program, we have learned that we can live and work in space for long periods of time. And we have found that the results of these efforts can be of enormous practical value to life on earth. “Skylab now joins the ranks of the Santa Maria, the H.M.S. Beagle, the Spirit of St. Louis, and the Eagle. Each of these great vehicles has carried us beyond the contemporary limits of human knowledge into a new comprehension of our own possibilities and a new definition of our own destiny. We welcome the men of Skylab home, and we salute them and all their predecessors who have launched us on this great adventure.” {PD, 11 Feb 74,193; A&A 1973) .
A declassified feasibility study by Goodyear Aerospace Corp. had indicated that reflector satellites 200-900 m in diameter could illuminate ground areas continuously at night, the Huntsville Times reported. Pointing out commercial uses, an official from Marshall Space Flight Center, which had managed the Project Able study, told the Times that potential applications included reflecting microwaves from space for conversion to electrical power, beaming rays on Florida’s orange groves should frost threaten the fruit crop, and lighting Alaska during its extended darkness. Launched on a Saturn V booster or on the space shuttle, a 640-m-dia, 20 000-kg reflector satellite could provide twice the light of the full moon and raise the temperature of the area covered by several degrees, (Casebolt, Huntsville Times, 11 Sept 74)
American Broadcasting Co. Science Editor Jules Bergman recalled tales of astronauts in a TV Guide article and noted that, with the splashdown of Skylab 4, an incredible era of space flight had come to an end. In 30 manned flights the U.S. had moved from the first 15-min sub-oibital flight to 12 Americans walking on the moon and then finally to the near-routine Skylab endurance missions. It would be a long while before someone set out for the planets, a trip which would require far more advanced propulsion systems than now available. But “we will go to the planets. . . . We will go beyond Jupiter. We will go beyond this solar system and eventually build starcraft to go so far that man’s only limit will be his imagination and ingenuity. But the mission clearly for the next decade is this Earth: it is the only home man has at the moment.” (TV Guide, 2 March 74)

Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, Apollo 17 astronaut and now Special Assistant to the NASA Administrator for Energy Research and Development, testified in Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences hearings on FY 1975 authorizations: One of the most important contributions NASA could make to energy research and development was the application of managerial techniques developed in the space program, permitting programs, schedules, and budgets to be defined and then adhered to without major degradation of the original goals. “This mission-oriented approach to research and development and its broad integration of the great capabilities and imagination of industry will... be applied just as successfully to the critical problems that face the Nation and the world in energy.” (Transcript)
A probe into the next 50 yrs was the subject of a series of articles in Saturday Review/World. Soviet atomic scientist Andrei D. Sakharov envisioned flying cities—artificial earth satellites with important industrial functions. The satellites would hold nuclear and thermonuclear installations with radiant cooling of heat exchangers, to avoid heating the earth, and would also serve as cosmic research laboratories and way stations for long-distance flights. Sakharov also foresaw greater attempts to establish communication with other civilizations by searching for and transmitting interplanetary signals on all known wavelengths and searching outer space for space stations of extraterrestrial civilizations. Powerful telescopes set up on the moon would permit scientists to see planets orbiting the nearest stars. Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong said that in 50 yrs every interesting crater and cranny of the moon would have been visited and revisited and lunar exploration would be replaced by lunar exploitation. Underground lunar colonies, protected from extreme temperatures, would consist of pressurized compartments connected by tunnels. One day man might want to build an atmosphere on the moon to avoid the inconveniences of living in a near vacuum, but in the nearer future the use of the moon’s vacuum for activities such as materials processing was a major reason for being there. Craters on the dark side of the moon, always facing away from the earth, could hold radio and x-ray telescopes for transmissions, unadulterated by earth noise, to and from outer space. Deep craters, which received no sunlight and had temperatures nearing absolute zero, would be ideal for low-temperature laboratories where scientists could investigate the point where molecular motion nearly stops. Lunar agriculture would be underground under lights in modified lunar soil fed with a nutrient solution. Although by 2024 the only extraterrestrial colonies would be on the moon, men probably would have visited Mars and a few selected celestial bodies. Men exploring space might well use a miniaturized heart-lung machine, circumventing the need for breathing and spacesuits. Dr. Wernher von Braun, former Marshall Space Flight Center Director, predicted a worldwide satellite search would be started for additional deposits of metal ore, coal, oil, shale, and natural gas. Satellite data would also provide key data for a badly needed worldwide food supply management system. Von Braun predicted nuclear lasers in geosynchronous orbit would handle millions of TV channels simultaneously and billions of telephone conversations and would lead to worldwide video-telephone service. Advanced meteorological satellites would provide accurate two-week weather forecasts and disaster warnings, saving millions of dollars in property damage. (Saturday Review/World, 24 Aug 74)
Wallops Station, Wallops Island, Va., was renamed Wallops Flight Center to describe its mission and operations more accurately. The Center had responsibility for development and launch of scientific payloads, using boosters ranging from the small Areas to the four-stage, solid-propellant Scout. The installation had been established in 1945 as the Pilotless Aircraft Research Station of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and had served as a base for launching small rockets. After NASA had been established in 1958, it became known as Wallops Station and assumed an expanded mission in support of space flight programs. (nasa Ann, 25 April 74)
Wind-tunnel tests at Ames Research Center had indicated that NASA’s swing-wing aircraft configuration could provide a practical design for an advanced commercial jet transport, NASA announced. The aircraft’s straight wing, mounted above the body, could be turned to various oblique angles for different flight speeds and was proposed for slow and fast design versions. Operating at speeds of 800 to 1400 km per hr, the needle-nosed fast version would maintain relatively economical fuel consumption—13 000 to 17 000 km per cu m per passenger—about twice the fuel economy of supersonic transports like the Concorde or the Russian Tu-144. For slower flight, the wing would be fixed at right angles to the fuselage, for landings and takeoffs with minimum power and noise. The design’s flexibility would permit shorter flight times with little increase in overall fuel consumption, (nasa Release 74-318)

The International Aeronautical Federation held its 25th Congress in Amsterdam with the theme “Space Stations, Present and Future.” Among speakers, Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford and Cosmonaut Aleksey A. Leonov, U.S. and Soviet commanders in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, stressed how well joint work and understanding had advanced. A paper by Daniel J. Shramo of Lewis Research Center, with B. R. Foushee and P. J. O’Leary of General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., described the Centaur primary upper stage for solar system exploration and its potential adaptation as an upper stage for the space shuttle. A Ukranian Academy of Sciences research team reported on experiments in the formation of melts in weightlessness with radiant heating and on prospects of using solar energy for space engineering. Comparative studies of metal solidification had suggested that a more uniform distribution of short-grained structures under weightlessness might become the basis of space technology, with the added attraction of using the sun as an energy source. The team had built a prototype solar plant that could be mounted on a spacecraft or used in a vacuum chamber on the earth. Soviet medical investigations during the flights of Soyuz 12 (launched 27 Sept. 1973), Soyuz 13 (18 Dec. 1973), and Soyuz 14 (3 July) were reported by Dr. Oleg G. Gazenko and others. Findings indicated that prolonged exercises, full and partial spacesuits, and gravity-simulating fittings had reduced effects of weightlessness during the space flight and after the crew’s return. Although reports of initial adaptation symptoms were similar to American findings, the Soviet paper also noted that cosmonauts had reduced vestibular symptoms by deliberately slowing down movements, especially head movements. Prof. Hilding A. Bjurstedt, Head of the Dept, of Aviation Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, received the 1974 Daniel and Florence Guggenheim International Astronautics Award of the International Academy of Astronautics for studies of physiological responses to environmental stress. Leonard Jaffe, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications, was elected iaf President (iaa Ann Rpt, 28 Aug 74; Parks, SF, Feb 75, 42-50; Program, 25th iaf Congress; NASA Activities, 15 Dec 74, 21) During September: Large-scale verification tests of the “rectenna” receiving system for microwave energy transmission were run at Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA. A microwave energy transmission system was being developed to determine the possibility of transmitting energy through space. The tests established a new record for microwave power transmission, delivering one kilowatt over a 1.6-km range. The 10-yr program had increased DC-to-DC efficiency of transmissions from 17% to 50% and efficiency of the rectenna in converting radio frequency to dc from 25% to 78%.

Total employment in the aerospace industry was expected to drop back to 948 000 positions in June 1974 after a temporary increase during the last quarter of 1973, according to the semiannual forecast released by the Aerospace Industries Association. September 1973 payrolls had been up 4000 positions over the June 1973 level of 949 000; December employment had added another 9000 positions; end of the year employment totaled 962 000 workers, the highest level since 1970.

President Ford signed into law the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (P.L. 93^138), abolishing the Atomic Energy Commission and establishing in its place three new Federal entities: the Energy Research and Development Administration, the Energy Resources Council, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The President also signed Executive Order 11841, activating the Energy Resources Council and appointing the Secretary of the Interior its Chairman. P.L. 93—438 was to become effective not later than 120 days after signature. {PD, 14 Oct 74,1271-3; CR, 8 Oct 74, H10134) Ariel 5—a 132-kg, solar-powered, 16-sided polygon designed by the U.K.—was the fifth satellite launched in a cooperative program between NASA and the U.K. Science Research Council. The mission of its one-year operating life was to study x-ray sources both within and beyond our galaxy, using five experiments from U.K. and one from Goddard Space Flight Center. Instruments were designed to follow up findings of UhuTu (Explorer 42), launched 12 Dec. 1970, and Oao 3, launched 21 Aug. 1971. Uhuru had extended the number of known celestial x-ray sources from about 30 to 200 and found evidence of a black hole companion to Cygnus X-l, later supported by Oao 3, sounding rocket, and ground-based observations. Four Ariel 5 pointing experiments focused on specific x-ray sources, and two scanning experiments swept the entire galaxy with every revolution. The GSFC scanning experiment—first of its kind to fly on an orbiting scientific satellite—consisted of two x-ray pinhole cameras, each with a 90° field of view, providing together a sweep of the entire sky. After evaluation, Ariel 5 results would be available to the world scientific community. Though all experiments obtained data during initial tests, two were drawing excessive current. The problem was resolved by outgassing. A slight delay in shutter closing on Experiment A, a star sensor, had little or no effect on the mission. The U.K.-U.S. cooperative satellite series had begun with Ariel 1 in 1962 and continued through Ariel 4, launched 11 Dec. 1971. Ariel 5 was launched under a 2 Nov. 1970 src-nasa Memorandum of Understanding, with a 27 Dec. 1973 letter modification shifting the launch site from Wallops Flight Center to San Marco to enhance scientific data return. The Memorandum tasked src with spacecraft design, fabrication, and testing, five experiments, primary command and control, and data reduction and analysis, nasa was responsible for one experiment, spacecraft technical support, the Scout launch vehicle, and tracking, command, and data acquisition, src financed all aspects of the Ariel program. The launch by members of the Univ. of Rome’s Aerospace Research Center was the seventh from San Marco, but the first payload for a country other than the U.S. or Italy (nasa mors, 11 Oct 6, Nov 74; nasa Release 74-274)

Using the NASA technique, a Boeing 727 aircraft approaching on a two-segment path exposed only a 50-sq-km area to greater than 90 effective perceived decibels of noise. The program was closely coordinated with the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Program guidance was provided by a Panel on Noise Abatement Flight Procedures with members from FA A, DOT, aircraft and avionics manufacturers, airlines, and pilots’ associations.

An experimental scanning laser doppler system, originally developed at Marshall Space Flight Center to measure atmospheric winds and turbulence, was being tested at msfc to determine the system’s reliability in detecting and monitoring aircraft wake vortices. Flyby tests had been conducted by msfc and the Federal Aviation Administration at Redstone Arsenal using a Boeing Co. 720 aircraft and two laser doppler units. Early results indicated that, in addition to detecting the vortices, the laser doppler system provided data on the air speeds within them. Two experimental systems would be used in field tests at Kennedy International Airport in New York after checkout of the units was completed. (nasa Release 74-127)
The first Skylab crew—Charles Conrad, Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, and Paul J.

The annual award was given by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics “for outstanding contributions by test personnel who undergo personal risk in the advancement of space flight.” The three-day conference, 30 Oct.—1 Nov., was sponsored jointly by the AIAA and the American Geophysical Union, (msfc Release 74-205; msfc pao, interview)
Photographs from the Skylab missions, Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite, and a NASA U—2 aircraft had helped end a legal confrontation between land developers and the State of Florida, Kennedy Space Center reported. Proposed heavy development of a section of the Green Swamp had threatened to endanger a subsurface rock formation, the Florida Acquifer, which provided 90% of the state’s water. In conflict were the rights of owners to develop their property and the public’ 's right to protect vital water resources. The NASA photos demonstrated the effects of land development and led to a settlement beneficial to both parties, permitting development in large tracts with carefully planned drainage and without chemical control of aquatic weeds, (ksc Release 90-74)
Project da Vinci—oft-delayed manned-atmospheric-research balloon flight—was terminated after one third of its projected 36-hr duration, because of threatening weather. The joint project of the Atomic Energy Commission, National Geographic Society, and the Army’s Atmospheric Sciences Laboratory was intended primarily to investigate atmospheric behavior at 1200-4300 m, where less scientific research had been done than at very high and very low altitudes. Floating free and staying with a single parcel of air as long as possible, the four crewmen studied atmospheric behavior over mountains, plains, forests, and cities. They had hoped to travel in their 21-m helium balloon from the launch site at Las Cruces, N. Mex., to a landing near Lubbock, Tex. The project safety officer terminated the flight over Wagon Mound, N. Mex., but not before enough data had been gathered to plan future flights.

The spacecraft then headed on toward a September 1979 encounter with Saturn. Pioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972, had been the first spacecraft to reach Jupiter—3 Nov. 1973—9 Jan. 1974. The success of that mission permitted NASA scientists to attempt a somewhat riskier approach with the backup Pioneer 11, a clockwise trajectory by the south polar region and then straight up through the intense inner radiation belt by the equator and back out over the north pole. Although the spacecraft went within 42 000 km of the planet at 12:22 am est 3 Dec., its peak speed of 171 000 km per hr and the trajectory’s high latitude prevented serious radiation damage. The Jupiter mission of Pioneer 11 was to map the magnetic field; measure distributions of high-energy electrons and protons in the radiation belts and look for auroras; find a basis for interpreting radio emissions from Jupiter; detect and measure the bow shock and magnetospheric boundary and their interactions with the solar wind; verify the thermal balance and determine temperature distribution of the outer atmosphere; measure the hydrogen-helium ratio in the atmosphere; measure the structure of the ionosphere and atmosphere; measure the brightness, color, and polarization of Jupiter’s reflected light; perform two-color visible-light imaging; and increase the accuracy of orbit predictions and masses of Jupiter and its moons. The interplanetary mission was to map the interplanetary magnetic field; study the radial gradient of the solar wind and its fluctuations and structure; study the radial and transverse gradients and arrival directions of high-energy charged particles (solar and galactic cosmic rays); investigate relationships between the solar wind, magnetic field, and cosmic rays; search for the boundary and extent of the heliosphere (solar atmosphere) ; determine the density of neutral hydrogen; and determine the properties of interplanetary dust. Hurtling toward and then away from Jupiter, Pioneer 11 sent data back to the earth at 2048 bits per sec throughout most of the month before and after encounter. Picture-taking of Jupiter began 18 Nov., at 14 800 000 km out from the planet. From 25 Nov. through 8 Dec., imaging and polarimetry observations were made 23 hrs a day. On 26 Nov. Pioneer 11 crossed the detached bow shock wave (7 772 000 km out) at the juncture of the solar wind and Jupiter’s magnetic field and entered the magnetosphere (6 923 000 km out). In five hours the spacecraft passed undamaged through this first field of intense radiation. On 1 Dec. it crossed the orbit of Callisto—outermost of the five inner moons—and began returning its best pictures of Jupiter. On 2 Dec. Pioneer 11 crossed the orbits of Jupiter’s four closest moons and entered the inner radiation belt. During this last leg of the approach to the south polar region, the spacecraft continued the imaging and sensing of the planet and moons and made a closeup, two-hour scan that included the red spot portion of the surface. Less than 12 hrs before the spacecraft passed behind Jupiter, an intense peak of electron radiation built up a 4000-v electric charge within the spacecraft. The charge created an electric arc that signaled heater lines to turn on—drawing spacecraft power and weakening the signal to earth. In about three hours the problem was identified and override commands from earth switched the beaters back off. At midnight on 3 Dec. Pioneer 11 entered Jupiter radio occultation— a blackout that lasted 42 min while the spacecraft swung behind the 142 744-km-dia planet—moving from the south pole straight up over the north pole. Since Pioneer 11 radio signals required 46 min to cross the 737 million km separating the earth and Jupiter at the time of encounter, the spacecraft had already circumscribed tbe planet before the earth lost contact with its signal. During occultation the spacecraft passed through the most intense radiation (up to 40 000 times as much in the earth’s radiation belts), reached its greatest speed (171 000 km per hr) and came closest to the planet (witbin 42 000 km of the cloudtops). At 1:24 am EST—62 min after periapsis—the signal reached earth, indicating that the spacecraft had emerged from behind the planet and that all systems had survived the most critical phase of the mission. Temporary failures had lost some data, but no permanent damage was sustained. Following the Jupiter encounter, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, renamed the spacecraft Pioneer-Saturn as it headed toward the planet Saturn. The exact target point had not been selected but scientists considered an interesting possibility was to target the spacecraft to pass between Saturn and its rings and then close by Titan, one of Saturn’s moons and a possible location of life. The five-year, 2.4-billion-km trip to Saturn would carry Pioneer-Saturn about 160 000 000 km above the orbit planes of most planets. Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to use the gravity of an outer planet to throw it to another planet farther out, came the closest to Jupiter, was the fastest spacecraft yet launched, and was the first spacecraft to photograph Jupiter’s polar regions. Pioneer-Saturn was expected to become the first spacecraft to pass far from the ecliptic plane and the first to reach Saturn. Pioneer 11 confirmed, but somewhat modified, the findings of Pioneer 10. The model of a relatively flat, disclike magnetosphere was challenged by new evidence suggesting a large, blunt magnetosphere of irregular and fluctuating shape. Temperature measurements of about 125 K at cloud-tops supported Pioneer 10 readings, which were lower than those indicated by earth-based observations. Imaging revealed a decrease in the banding structure of the planet with increased latitude and a more mottled structure across the poles, (nasa Releases 74-292, 74-300; Hall, Opp, et al., Science, 2 May 75, 445-77; NASA Pioneer Mgr, interview, 12 Nov 75; NASA press conference transcript, 19 Nov 74; Perlman, SF Chron, 3 Dec 74; O’Toole, W Post, 3 Dec 74, Al; Sullivan, NYT, 4 Dec 74, 27; Mead, San Jose Mercury, 5 Dec 74; NYT, 9 Dec 74)
Data from Pioneer 10, launched 2 March 1972 toward a 3 Dec. 1973 encounter with Jupiter, had indicated that sulfur was one possible element in the surface composition of Jupiter’s moon Io, Marshall Space Flight Center announced. Scientists at msfc had studied the reflective properties of Io and concluded that sulfur was one of the few materials that could have the high reflectivity and strong absorption features observed. The theory would be tested by measuring the changes in reflectivity of sulfur at different wavelengths and temperatures and observing the reflectivity change of Io in the fall when Jupiter would be in the evening sky.

NASA FY 1975 authorization bill H.R. 13998, a clean bill introduced 4 April to replace H.R. 12689, was reported out of the House Committee oh Science and Astronautics. The revised bill would authorize $3,253 billion in FY 1975 funding, an increase of $6 million over the original request. Authorizations for research and development increased $11 million to $2,357 billion, and construction of facilities decreased $5 million, to $146.5 million. Funding for research and program management remained the same. Iiicluded in the k&d increases was a $2Q-million addition, to a total $112.3 million, for the space shuttle main engine, which had encountered technical problems during early development. The increase was proposed to add confidence in meeting schedules and hold total program costs at the current projection. A $4.3-million increase, to $170.7 million, was added for aeronautical research and technology. A $1.8-million increase brought the total for space and nuclear research and technology to $76.6 million. Manned space flight operations funding was decreased $15 million, to $308.3 million, including a $5-million decrease (to $109.6 million) for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project and a $10-million decrease (to $165.2 million) in development, test, and mission operations. Changes in facility construction authorizations included an increase of $4 million, to $10.04 million for construction of the infrared telescope facility in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The Committee also requested that NASA make a scientific and technological inventory of its capability to contribute to such critical national needs as energy, transportation, and environmental control. NASA was to report to the Committee by 1 Aug. (H Rpt 93-983)

Francis C. Schwenk, Director of the Research Div. in NASA’s Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology, testified on four NASA projects in hearings on space nuclear propulsion and power before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology. Early research had shown that high-temperature thermionic converters combined with a compact nuclear reactor could provide an efficient power plant for advanced planetary missions. NASA technology would now focus on thermionic energy conversion for achieving highly efficient operation at lower temperatures. During the Apollo and Pioneer programs, NASA had proved the advantages of a small (40- to 70-w) radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator power system, which had operated at 6% efficiency at a cost of $20 million per kilowatt. NASA was developing technology for a 0.5- to 2.0-kw gas-turbine conversion system (Bray-ton energy conversion system) to achieve efficiencies of 25% and reduce costs to one fourth. Gaseous-core nuclear rocket research had led to plasma-core reactors as advanced energy sources for terrestrial as well as space propulsion uses; use of uranium hexafluoride as plasma fuel was expected to achieve efficiencies of more than 50%. Lewis Research Center research into superconducting magnets and plasma confinement and heating in advanced steady-state schemes was expected to show within a year whether a superconductive magnetic apparatus (summa) could produce fusionlike plasmas as predicted.

Dr. Goetz K. Oertel, nasa Chief of Solar Physics, testified during NASA FY 1975 authorization hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight that Skylab data had changed the understanding of the solar wind. Scientists had thought the solar wind reached the earth because of an expansion of the sun’s corona, but Skylab data indicated the sun’s magnetic fields confined the corona material and pulled it inward. The corona expanded and escaped in a significant amount only through coronal holes in the magnetic field. Dr. Charles A. Berry, Director of Life Sciences, testified that the Skylab 2 and Skylab 3 crews (launched 25 May and 28 July 1973) had experienced similar reductions in their blood cell mass, with a red blood cell reduction. However, after the 59-day Skylab 3 mission the compensating response of the blood-forming elements was faster, returning the mass almost to the pr'eflight level within two weeks after splashdown—rather than the six weeks required after the 28-day Sky-lab 2 mission. The Skylab 4 crew (which splashed down Feb. 8 after 16 Nov. 1973 launch) showed much less red blood cell loss and a much faster return to preflight levels after the 84-day mission, indicating adaptive changes to the space environment. The space life sciences program sought to understand the mechanisms of adaptive changes and would “undoubtedly assist our understanding of basic body physiology of man here on earth.” Capt. Chester M. Lee, Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Program Director, said that during Skylah missions the orbital altitude and the limited number of ground stations had permitted communications coverage only 38% of the time. The lower orbital altitude for ASTP would reduce communications coverage to 17%. To alleviate the problem, the Apollo command module was being modified for communications via the ATS—F Applications Technology Satellite, scheduled for 1974 launch. Communications woxdd move from a manned spacecraft through an unmanned communications satellite to the ground for the first time. Coverage would be increased to 50%. The present configuration of the communications network would furnish minimum real-time data to meet experimental requirements. (Transcript)
A vertical-axis windmill was under study at Langley Research Center as a potential source of nonpolluting energy. The windmill, based on a 1927 principle, had two four-meter curved blades attached at the top and bottom to a five-meter vertical shaft, set on a simple gear system, and a generator that converted wind power to electricity. The airfoilshaped blades rotated in almost any wind and were expected to achieve enough revolutions per minute to provide the energy requirements of a single-family house at an estimated construction and installation cost of $500 to $1000. A much larger windmill project at Lewis Research Center, for the National Science Foundation, was studying large concentrations of windmills for industrial use [see 11 Jan.]. (NASA Release 74r-33)
President Nixon, in his message transmitting the U.S, budget for FY 1975 to Congress, said the budget emphasized fiscal balance and continued “moderate restraint” on the economy to curb inflation, a strong defense force, a comprehensive energy program to “reestablish our ability to be self-sufficient in energy,” the “New Federalism philosophy of strengthening the role of State and local governments,” and a “more intensive focus on the tangible results that programs achieve.” The $304.4-billion budget proposed an increase for defense from $79.5 billion in FY 1974 to $85.8 billion, “so that we can increase our defense preparedness and preserve present force levels in the face of rising costs.” Despite dollar increases caused by rising costs and by pay raises accompanying transition to an all-volunteer armed force, the President said, the proportion of defense costs to the total budget had fallen from 44% in 1969 to an estimated 29% in 1975, after the end of U.S. combat in Vietnam. Project Independence, to reestablish U.S. self-sufficiency in energy, would require about $10 billion for accelerated energy research and development over the next five years and would encourage an even larger private R&D investment. Higher prices would be necessary to stimulate development of fuel supplies, but the emergency windfall profits tax had been proposed to curb excessive profits. The national energy policy included reorganization of Federal administrative machinery, stringent energy conservation measures, mandatory allocation of petroleum products, mandatory reporting on oil production and inventories, modernization of railroad regulations, accelerated development of domestic oil and gas reserves, increased use of coal reserves, development of a fast-breeder nuclear reactor, faster approval of energy facility sites, faster construction of nuclear power plants, and increased research into advanced energy sources, including fusion power and geothermal and solar energy. . Shortages of clean fuels would mean “some temporary variances from air quality plans” would be necessary to meet high-priority energy needs. “The progress we have made in pollution control in recent years, however, along with reductions in energy consumption, should insure that overall air quality will continue to improve.” (CR, 4 Feb 74, H407-14; PD, 11 Feb 74,161-70)
Aerospace industry employment would reach 968 000 by December—the highest level since May 1971—but then drop by 8000 by June 1975, the Aerospace Industries Assn, of America predicted in its semiannual survey. The increase over previous estimates was attributed to an unexpected rise in production and delivery of aircraft, while the missile and space sectors of the industry remained essentially constant. Commercial transport deliveries were expected to slow down in the first half of 1975. (aia Release 74-16)
Federal research and development support of space programs had declined steadily in proportion to civil projects from 1969 to 1975, the National Science Foundation reported in its Analysis of Federal R&D Funding by Function, Fiscal Years 1969—1975. Energy and environment programs had outpaced other major civil programs, while space programs had been reduced more than any other R&D function in the period. In FY 1975, the space budget was 13% of the planned $19.6-billion Federal r&d funding, a decline from 23.9% in 1969. Manned space flight, including the space shuttle, would account for more than half the 1975 total, (nsf Report 74-313)
A Federal grand jury had charged Charles R. Riser of Maryland with mail fraud in setting up Andromeda Space Covers, a mail-order firm selling fake space exploration items, the Baltimore Sun reported. Fifteen persons had paid for golf balls driven across the moon by Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., during the January 1971 Apollo 14 mission, but he had used only two balls and these were still on the moon. The assistant U.S. attorney on the case said that astronauts might be called to state whether signatures on other souvenirs were authentic. (Erlandson, B Sun, 14 Sept 74, B20)
Siegbert B. Poritzky, Special Assistant for Systems and Research for the Air Transport Association, presented U.S. scheduled airlines’ views on nasa’s role and responsibility to the aircraft industry, before a House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on HUD-Space-Science-Veterans hearing on FY 1975 appropriations. Poritzky said it was NASA’s responsibility to build a technology base for aeronautics through innovative independent research in addition to undertaking directed research in response to specific problems. Also vitally important was NASA’s responsiveness to the needs of other agencies. Airlines recommended a $24.5-million increase in funding for NASA’s aeronautical programs— for propulsion environment-impact minimization, aircraft operations, alternative fuels, wake-vortex minimization, and noise research. James J. Hartford, Executive Secretary of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, testified that some cuts in the NASA budget were “penny wise and pound foolish.” Additional but “relatively modest” funding would prevent the High Energy Astronomical Observatory (heao) program—which was to investigate the scientifically exciting black holes in space—from “limping along.” Scientists had been skeptical of the usefulness of the space shuttle to science, but the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount discoveries had so far exceeded expectations that astronomers “could hardly wait” for the Large Space Telescope, planned for launch on the shuttle. “That project unified the space science community” as “nothing ever did in the past.” Other “logical follow-ons” to the approved program were urged: Mariner Jupiter-Uranus 1979 mission, Jupiter orbiter, Venus atmospheric probe, and a follow-on to the Viking Mars 1975 with a rover capability. Hartford also suggested that NASA and other Government agencies were not doing enough work in space applications. Cuts in NASA’s communications satellite research and development program had been based on the incorrect assumption that private industry could take on full comsat r&d with no further Government stimulus. Early commercial exploitation of communications R&D had been rapid only because Government research had reduced risks to an acceptable level. Competition was now coming from Canadian, Japanese, and European organizations with “a lot of government backing” who had developed a technical capability approaching that of the U.S. and were willing to take high risks.

Deferral of $72 million in nasa FY 1975 r&d funding was proposed by President Ford in a message to Congress. Aeronautical research and space support activities would be deferred by $36 million, affecting advanced systems for space exploration and aeronautics, analysis of data in the space science program, and maintenance and upgrading of equipment for the tracking and data-acquisition program. In manned space flight, $20 million in astp funds would be deferred. And in space science and applications, deferral of $16 million in no-year (not designated for a specific year) funds would delay the rate of buildup of Pioneer-Venus, seasat-a, Nimbus-G, Tiros-N, and the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission. These deferrals were parts of a $4.6-billion budget outlay reduction asked by the President. (PD, 2 Dec 74, 1500-1; CR, 26 Nov 74, S20096-7; Federal Register, 5 Dec 74,42519-667)
The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology, reporting on almost a year’s investigation of NASA’s tracking and data acquisition program, said the program was effective and efficient and that planned consolidation was progressing well. The consolidation, to be completed by 1976 with a reduction of stations from 25 to 15, would combine the Manned Space Flight Network and the Space Tracking and Data Acquisition Network into one Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (stdn). The Subcommittee recommended that the FY 1976 NASA Authorization request include a detailed analysis of the need for an additional subnet of three 64-m antennas for the Deep Space Network and report on the status of relations and agreements with the U.S.S.R. The Subcommittee warned that NASA’s T&DA capabilities were not designed for the workload that future operational systems would require; solutions should be studied by the President’s Science Adviser. NASA was asked to furnish an analysis of lease versus purchase of satellites for the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss) in its FY 1975 authorization request. (Com Print)

The European Space Research Organization ^ejected a plan to install a launch pad for the McDonnell Douglas Thor-Delta launch vehicle at the Kourou Space Center in French Guiana. The ESRO decision, which followed a four-month feasibility study, cited the high cost of installing the pad—set at approximately $50 million—as the reason for the rejection. The press speculated that, although proponents of the proposal contended the Thor-Delta launch capability would complement the European Ariane launcher under development, the plan might have run into opposition from Ariane supporters who feared competition. NASA, when queried by ESRO officials, had voiced no objections to. the plan even though the equatorial launch site would have increased the vehicle’s orbital weight capacity by about 20% over launches from the U.S., making the site an economical alternative for commercial customers.

The refanned JT8D jet engine successfully completed its first test at full power, at Lewis Research Center. The engine, part of NASA’s program to reduce jet engine noise, was run through its complete operating speed range and achieved a thrust value above takeoff thrust. Built by United Aircraft Corp. Pratt & Whitney Div., the JT8D was used in a major portion of the U.S. narrow-body commercial air fleet. Modified by replacing the two-stage fan with a larger, single-stage fan, the engine could reduce the noise footprint areas of these aircraft by 75%. (nasa Release 74-57; LeRC pio, interview, Oct 75)

The U.S.S.R. launched Cosmos 656 from Baykonur Cosmodrome into orbit with a 322-km apogee, 185-km perigee, 89.6-min period, and 51.8° inclination. The press reported that Cosmos 656 was probably a test flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. The spacecraft reentered 29 May. (gsfc SSR, 30 June 74; Tass, Fbis-Sov, 29 May 74, Ul; O’Toole, W Post, 30 May 74, A18) ' 29 May—19 June: The U.S.S.R. launched Luna 22 unmanned lunar probe from Baykonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam at 1:57 pm local time (4:57 am edt). The automatic station was separated from a platform rocket system in earth orbit and put into a close-to-planned trajectory for the moon. A flight-path correction maneuver 30 May aimed the spacecraft toward a selected area of near-moon space. Luna 22 went into circular orbit of the moon 2 June, with a 220-km apogee, 220-km perigee, 130.0-min period, and 19.6° inclination. The Soviet press reported 3 June that all instruments aboard the spacecraft were functioning normally and scientific investigation of the moon had begun. Luna 22 was transferred into an elliptical orbit with a 244-km apogee and 25-km perigee 9 June to take detailed TV photos of the lunar surface and to study surface relief using an onboard altimeter. Chemical composition of rocks was obtained by determining the gamma radiation. After completion of the photography program the spacecraft was moved to an orbit with a 299-km apogee and 181-km perigee. By 19 June Luna 22 had completed 187 orbits of the moon; all equipment continued to function normally, (gsfc SSR, 30 June 74; Tass, fbis-Sov, 30 May 74, Ul; 4 June 74, Ul; 20 June 74, Ul; SF, Nov 74, 434) 30 May—28 June: NASA launched Ats 6 Applications Technology Satellite from Eastern Test Range at 9:00 am edt on a Titan TlIC launch vehicle. The booster ejected the transtage and spacecraft into an elliptical parking orbit with a 626-km apogee and 152-km perigee. At the second equatorial crossing the first bum of the transtage placed the spacecraft in a transfer orbit. Launch, parking orbit, and transfer orbit were close to the program plan. At 3:29 pm EDT, Ats 6 was injected into geosynchronous orbit with a 35 845.6-km apogee, 35 774.1-km perigee, 23-hr 57-min period, and 1.8° inclination. The near-perfect orbit eliminated need for corrections, leaving nine kilograms of fuel for operational contingencies. The spacecraft separated from the transtage at 3:33 pm EDT. An orbital correction 7 June changed the 0.27°-per-day westward drift to a 0.05° eastward drift. Checkout of spacecraft systems and onboard experiments was completed 28 June with no significant anomalies. The mission was adjudged a success 26 Sept Primary objectives of the mission were to inject the spacecraft into near-geostationary orbit, erect and evaluate a nine-meter antenna to provide a good-quality signal to small inexpensive ground receivers, stabilize the spacecraft using a three-axis control system, and support user-oriented applications experiments. Secondary objectives were to demonstrate new technology in aircraft and maritime traffic control and infrared earth observations; acquire system data for communications applications in space, including spacecraft-to-spacecraft relay; test spacecraft control; and measure particles and radiation. The 20 experiments included a health-education telecommunications experiment to broadcast programs in several languages simultaneously to citizens in remote areas of the country. The satellite also would aid in remote medical telediagnosis and teleconsultation, transmitting patients’ medical records to faraway hospital centers for emergency assistance. One year after launch Ats 6 would be moved over Lake Victoria in Central Africa. India would then use the satellite to broadcast programs teaching agricultural techniques, family planning and hygjene, school courses and teacher education, and occupational skills to 5000 villages. The $600 ground receiving terminals each consisted of a receiver, converter, and three-meter chicken-wire antenna. Ats 6 was the sixth in a series of ATS satellites developed to advance technology in design, propulsion, and stabilization systems; meteorological concepts; applications; space environmental studies and measurement systems; and communications. Ats 1 (launched 6 Dec. 1966), Ats 3 (5 Nov. 1967), and Ats 5 (12 Aug. 1969) were still transmitting useful data. The ATS program was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under the direction of the Office of Applications.

NASA submitted its report NASA Energy-Related Research and Development to the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, at the request of its chairman, Sen. Frank E. Moss (D—Utah), nasa’s FY 1974 budget had included a $2-million authorization for energy r&d for projects in solar energy utilization; energy conversion, transmission, and storage; transportation and propulsion systems; and energy and environmental conservation. Long-range research included studies of satellite systems to collect solar energy, convert it to electricity, and transmit it to the earth by microwave beams. In one study the use of solar cells would be considered, while in another the possibility of a turbogenerator in space would be explored. Near-term projects included demonstration of residential solar heating and cooling at Marshall Space Flight Center, office building tests at Langley Research Center, and component studies at Lewis Research Center. LeRC was also sponsoring a study of crops that could be converted into clean fuels, and a NASA-National Science Foundation study was testing wind-electric generating devices. Projects at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and LeRC sought to design low-polluting but higher efficiency automobile engines, and Flight Research Center was testing configuration changes to reduce aerodynamic drag for trucks. Energy conversion research included an LeRC study, in cooperation with the Dept, of Interior, of technical and economic advantages of a potassium topping cycle to permit higher peak cycle temperatures and produce 40% more electrical power for a given quantity of fuel than could conventional steam systems.

NASA and the Federal Government as a whole were charged with race and sex discrimination in a class action suit filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (naacp) Legal Defense Fund in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The suit was initiated by two employees at Johnson Space Center. The naacp Legal Defense Fund labeled as “lame excuses” NASA’s claims that work forces were dropping throughout the agency and that it was difficult to find qualified blacks and women in its specialized areas of work. (AP, NYT, 21 Nov 74; Robinson, W Post, 21 Nov 74) 21 November-20 December: NASA launched Intelsat-IV F-8 for the Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization. The 1387-kg satellite was launched from Eastern Test Range at 6:44 pm est on an Atlas-Centaur vehicle into a transfer orbit with a 35 899.2-km apogee, 536.5-km perigee, 10-hr 39.8-min period, and 26.0° inclination. NASA’s primary objectives were to conduct design, performance, and flight readiness reviews for the Federal Communications Commission, to ensure compatibility of Intelsat spacecraft with NASA launch vehicles and launch environmental conditions, and to launch Intelsat-IV F-8 into a transfer orbit that would permit the spacecraft apogee motor to inject the spacecraft into a synchronous orbit for communications service. The apogee kick motor was fired by ComSatCorp at 6:48 pm est on 23 Nov., placing Intelsat-IV F-8 in a near-circular .orbit with a 35 780-km apogee, 35 630-km perigee, 23-hr 51.9-min period, and 1.8° inclination. The spacecraft then drifted to its station at 174° E longitude over the Pacific Ocean, arriving 12 Dec. NASA adjudged the mission a success 20 Dec. Intelsat-IV F-8 joined five operational Intelsat IV commercial com-sats: three over the Atlantic—F—2 launched 25 Jan 1971, F—3 launched 19 Dec. 1971, and F—7 launched 23 Aug. 1973; one over the Pacific— F—4 launched 22 Jan. 1972; and one over the Indian Ocean—F—5 launched 13 June 1972. F-8 replaced F-4, which became a spare, orbiting over 178° E longitude. F-8 was designed to operate seven years and could provide multiple access and simultaneous transmission. It had a capacity for 3000 circuits with transponders in earth mode and 9000 circuits with transponders in spot-beam-coverage mode, or 12 TV channels, or certain combinations, (nasa mors, 22 Nov, 24 Dec 74; GSFC Wkly SSR, 21-26 Nov 74; nasa Release 74-305; intelsat Releases 74-62,74-70; nasa Atlas-Centaur Mgr, interview, 30 July 75)

An electric rocket engine that short-circuited aboard Sert II Space Electric Rocket Test satellite in 1970 had been restarted in space and successfully operated for six weeks, scientists at Lewis Research Center reported. Launched 3 Feb. 1970 to demonstrate that electric propulsion could be used for future space missions, Sert II was to have operated an ion engine for six months in space. Engine thruster 2 shut down after less than three months of operation; thruster 1 performed for five months. Both failures were attributed to a small chip apparently eroded from a molybdenum grid and lodged between two grids at the back of the engine. William R. Kerslake, Sert II experiment manager, believed the chip was jarred loose in summer 1974 when the spacecraft was spun up by its cold-gas thruster system to obtain a better sun angle for solar arrays. Since then, the thruster had been operated successfully on 17 occasions for short periods, obtaining up to 80% of its maximum thrust. Electrical Propulsion Branch Chief Robert C. Finke said operation after 4% years proved “the long term storability of this thruster design” and indicated that the system could be “confidently incorporated into future missions requiring several years of thruster operation.” (LeRC Release 74—60)
Science and technology might be stepping into a more important role in the conduct of foreign policy, a Science article said. During an April speech before the United Nations Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of State, had urged that we “now apply science to the problems which science has helped to create.” He proposed international action in four areas: agricultural technology, birth control, energy, and weather. The Science article noted that access to U.S. technology had been a major inducement toward detente for the U.S.S.R. and the People’s Republic of China. Although the speech had made no specific commitments, the proposals, announced by the Secretary of State, became U.S. Government policy. By calling on science to help solve the world’s problems, “Kissinger clearly has the monster in his sights . . . but whether a coherent science policy will emerge is not yet evident.” (Wade, Science, 17 May 74, 780781)
Major reorganizations were announced at NASA Hq. and Marshall Space Flight Center by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, msfc Director. Dr. Fletcher said the Headquarters reorganization and key personnel appointments would consolidate planning and direction of research and development programs under the Associate Administrator and overall planning and direction of the field center operations under the newly created position of Associate Administrator for Center Operations. Dr. Petrone was named Associate Administrator. He would remain as msfc Director until early summer when he would be replaced by Dr. William R. Lucas, msfc Deputy Director. Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space Science, was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator. He would also continue as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Science until a successor was named. Dr. George M. Low, in addition to his duties as Deputy Administrator, would serve as Acting Associate Administrator for Center Operations until the new position was filled. He would be assisted by Edwin C. Kilgore, Deputy Associate Administrator for Management in the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology. Gen. Bruce K. Holloway (usaf, Ret.), who would also continue as the Assistant Administrator for Dept, of Defense and Interagency Affairs, was named Acting Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology. Bernard Moritz was appointed Associate Administrator for Organization and Management. The reorganization, effective 15 March, followed completion of the Apollo and Skylab programs and would provide mechanisms for the phaseover from conventional launch vehicles to the space shuttle and new programs, Dr. Fletcher said. At msfc, Dr. Petrone said that the reorganization, effective 30 May, would enable the Center to fulfill requirements of its varied assigned programs and improve its competitive position to obtain new assignments. The major changes were in the Science and Engineering Directorate. A Deputy for Operations and a Deputy for Systems had been established. Business operations and control of all resources had been consolidated into a centralized office at the directorate level. Elements under the s&E Directorate included two associate directors, an Associate Director of Engineering and an Associate Director of Management; two offices, Reliability and Quality Assurance and Research and Technology; and eight laboratories. The laboratories were being restructured to emphasize system engineering and integration, analysis, design, and testing. The in-house capability to manufacture, inspect, and check out major hardware projects had been eliminated, with the associated supply, warehousing, and procurement capability. Reorganization in msfc’s Administration and Program Support Directorate included consolidation of Center-wide automatic data-process-ing functions within A&PS. Offices under a&PS would include Technology Utilization, Manpower, Financial Management, Facilities, Procurement, Management, Services, Logistics, and Computer Services.

Dr. Philip E. Culbertson, Director of Mission and Payload Integration in NASA’s Office of Manned Space Flight, testified on manned space systems in development, before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight during FY 1975 authorization hearings. Dr. Culbertson said 986 payloads were projected for the 12-yr period beginning in 1980, with one third each for applications, science, and the Dept, of Defense. Duplication of the accomplishments expected from the space shuttle sortie (Spacelab) program would require automated spacecraft, sounding rockets, a manned space station, and a system for manned transport. The shuttle, with effective integration of payloads and the ability to service in-orbit spacecraft, offered a potential savings of $14 billion over expendable systems from 1980 to 1991. Studies had shown that 725 flights were required to fly the projected 986 payloads, an average of 60 flights a year. At a 10% rate of discount and a 10% rate of return, the space transportation system would break even if the shuttle were flown only 25 times a year. (Transcript) industry unwillingness to risk capital on advanced communications research and development. Private industry could meet short-term commercial needs but “continued NASA activity is essential to identify and meet long term national needs.” The investment level in advanced communications r&d would increase from $1.0 million in FY 1974 to $1.4 million in FY 1975. R&d included investigations into advanced antenna techniques to define radiation pattern contours to fit geographical boundaries and eliminate unwanted spillover; technology to open near-and far-infrared wavelengths for communications; new techniques in solid-state, high-power devices to replace traveling wave tubes; and use of millimeter-wave regions to expand the spectrum for satellite communications. The ATS—F Applications Technology Satellite scheduled for 1974 launch would conduct health and education telecommunications and radio beacon experiments and measure charged particles and magnetic fields over the U.S. for one year. The satellite would then be moved over India to beam educational TV to 4000 villages, ats-f (to he Ats 6 after launch) also would be used to extend coverage during the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project docking mission. Following completion of the Indian experiments, ats-f would he moved back over to the U.S. to continue experiments there. (Transcript)

Trace materials in Cleveland’s airborne particulate matter were not present in dangerous levels, but lead might approach these levels, scientists from Lewis Research Center reported at the Earth Environment and Resources Conference in Philadelphia. With the City of Cleveland’s Air Pollution Control Division, LeRC had conducted a two-year study using neutron activation and gas chromatography to determine levels of 60 trace materials. Processed by computer, levels of trace materials were related to wind direction in the form of maps. Sources of pollution could then be established by knowing which industry produced which elements and compounds and in what ratios. (LeRC Release 74-54)

Dr. G. D. Whedon of the National Institutes of Health stated that weightlessness could threaten capable musculo-skeletal functions during space flights lasting up to three years unless measures could be developed to prevent significant losses of calcium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Continued loss of calcium could cause astronauts to break their backs or legs and could promote formation of kidney stones. Dr. William E. Thornton, life scientist in the jsc Astronaut Office, reported that by Mission Day 3 all Skylab crewmen had lost more than 2000 cc (2 qts) of extravascular fluid from calf and thigh; at recovery, a sharp reversal was noted. The Thornton team suggested that the reason for the shift was the intrinsic and unopposed lower limb elasticity, which forced venous blood and other fluids toward the head. Other investigators reported that such cardiovascular changes as the heart’s decreased ventricular size and the suppression of red blood cell production was the body’s accommodation to weightlessness.

He would receive the award for his “farsighted development of men and facilities, and for decisive leadership of research that provided technological foundations for manned flight beyond the speed of sound, safe reentry of spacecraft, and successful exploration of space.” (Langley Researcher, 19 July 74,1; A&A, Dec 74,72)
Hearings on S. 2658 and H.R. 11864, to enact the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974, were held by the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Rep. Mike McCormack (D—Wash.) said the legislation—which called for NASA, with other agencies, to develop and demonstrate solar technology—would set up a program that the National Science Foundation was not authorized to do and therefore would create no conflict with nsf’s ongoing research and development program in solar energy. Dr. H. Guyford Stever, nsf Director, said that the bill should be considered in the context of the “intensive and coordinated R&D effort” already under way in the Executive Branch. The NSF Act had authorized nsf as lead agency in basic and applied solar research and, with interagency cooperation, NSF could bring “practical solar energy systems into widespread use.” Dr. Stever expressed the Nixon Administration view that the Energy Research and Development Administration (erda), proposed in other legislation, would be the preferred agency to accelerate applied solar technology when programs reached the stage of large demonstration and development. However, if that legislation were not approved, the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development would be preferable over nasa as lead agency, because of hud’s experience with the local groups that would carry out the projects. Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, also expressed the Administration’s support of erda and of continuing NSF as the lead agency until ERDA was established. Dr. Fletcher suggested as an alternative plan, if erda were not established, that nasa serve as lead agency in phase one, the development of the technology and construction of solar units. Phase two, building the houses and installing the units, could be best handled by hud. There would be “no big problem” in transferring the responsibility to erda should it be established.

Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb, Head of the Transonic Aerodynamics Branch at Langley Research Center, a $25 000 cash award for his invention of the supercritical wing. The cash award, made in a NASA Hq. ceremony, was the largest ever made by NASA to an individual. An improved airfoil design, the supercritical wing would permit significant increases in the speed and range of supersonic aircraft without increased fuel consumption.

The program had heen recommended hy the National Academy of Sciences to increase participation in space- and aeronautics-related research hy the scientific community. (NASA Release 74-197)
Dr. H. Guyford Stever, Director of the National Science Foundation and Chairman of the President’s Advisory Committee on Energy Research and Development, predicted that solar heating and cooling systems would be commercially available in five years. Following a speech at the Edison Electric Institute’s annual convention in New York, Dr. Stever said the technology would be ready before “society is ready to solve the economic issues surrounding it.” A choice would have to be made between “building a lower priced house with added cost for a solar heating-cooling system, or spending more on higher fuel prices in a conventional house.” (Smith, WSJ, 5 June 74, 65)
“The only way to face the crisis of our times is through the advancement of science and technology,” Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said in an address to the Cal Tech Management Club. “The space program is at the forefront of the search for knowledge, ... of producing knowledge, ... of developing the technological capability which comes from this knowledge.” Yet, “among even the higher echelons of the American business community, lack of understanding rather than comprehension of space ventures is the prevailing frame of mind.” Dr. Low called for communication to the American people of how the space program increased understanding of the universe and man’s place in it, improved life on earth, and kept the country secure through scientific, technological, and economic strength, as well as international cooperation.

Federal support to universities and colleges had declined 7%, to $3823 million, during FY 1973 in the first decline since 1970, the National Science Foundation reported. The drop had been largely the result of a $267-million decrease in funds from the Dept, of Health, Education, and Welfare but other significant decreases were posted by nsf, down $40 million; Dept, of Defense, down $11 million; and NASA, down $8 million. Federal funds for academic science activities totaled $2463 million, 5% below 1972. Two science fields had shown an increase in Federal r&d support between 1972 and 1973'. Life sciences’ $934 million was a 4% increase; engineering’s $204 million was up 6%.

Russell W. McFall, Chairman of the Board and President of Western Union Corp. transmitted the first message, from New York to Los Angeles, using the original Morse key to tap “What hath God wrought!” It was the same message sent by inventor Samuel F. B. Morse 24 May 1844 over the first experimental telegraph, a 65-km line between the Capitol in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Md. Regular commercial operations began 16 July, providing services for Westar J’s first two commercial customers, American Can Co. and Bank of America. (Westar Inaugural Transmission press kit, 15 July 74) 16— 29 July: NASA launched Aeros 2 (Aeros-B) aeronomy satellite for West Germany from Western Test Range at 4:51 am pdt on a four-stage Scout launch vehicle into polar orbit with an 879.0-km apogee, 221.3km perigee, 95.65-min period, and 97.44° inclination. The NASA mission objective—to place the Aeros 2 satellite in an earth orbit permitting successful achievement of the scientific objectives—was met and the mission was adjudged successful 26 July. The scientific objective was to measure the main aeronomic parameters of the upper atmosphere and the solar ultraviolet radiation in the wavelength band of the main absorption. The long-range objective of the satellite, which carried one Goddard Space Flight Center and four West German experiments, was to provide a model of the ionosphere from which upper atmospheric conditions could be predicted. By 29 July the vehicle and experiments were performing satisfactorily and the West Germans were initiating spacecraft operations. A July 1965 agreement between the U.S. and West Germany had provided for a series of cooperative satellite projects. The Aeros program, the second in the series, was authorized by a 10 June 1969 agreement and Aeros 1 was launched 16 Dec. 1972. The 1974 contract between NASA and the West Germany Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (bmft) for the Aeros 2 launch provided for reimbursement of NASA for launch vehicle and services. NASA would also provide one experiment, tracking, and backup for data acquisition, bmft was responsible for development of spacecraft and instrumentation operation and control of the satellite after launch, and data reduction and analysis except for the gsfc experiment. The spacecraft reentered 25 Sept. 1975. (nasa mors, 30 Nov 72, 8 & 29 July 74; NASA Releases 69-91, 74-183; gsfc SSR, 31 Oct 75) The 1969 launch of Apollo 11 was commemorated 16 July by ceremonies at Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad A. At 9:32 am edt, the moment of launch, Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., unveiled a plaque designating the site a National Historical Landmark. Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, told the thousands of guests: “No matter our achievements, ... we cannot relax our pursuit of knowledge, for we must face the coming crises of our time. Every effort must be made to see that the opportunity which our technology presents is not lost. We may be sure that the opportunity will not occur soon again, if ever. To fail now would mean a ravaged environment and depleted resources— a plunge into a new and terrible Dark Age from which there would be no return.” Unless “we continuously restore the fund of basic knowledge, we shall ultimately exhaust it. . . . “Some day we will establish scientific outposts on the Moon, and even tap its mineral resources. And in the not-too-distant future astronauts may tread the surface of Mars and the glaciers of the moons of Jupiter in search of extraterrestrial life. . . . The future began here at 9:32 a.m. on July 16, 1969. At that moment on July 16 in the year 2069, launch windows to Mars, Neptune, and Pluto will be open. Will we fly through those windows? I think we will.” In 19 July ceremonies at the San Clemente, Calif., Western White House, Armstrong presented President Nixon a plaque bearing the names of each astronaut who had represented “this country in a flight above the surface of the Earth.” President Nixon told Armstrong the greatest contribution to the space program was not the exploration or technology but the “spirit you and your colleagues . . . have had the opportunity to demonstrate.” The Smithsonian Institution hosted 20 July activities marking the day of the landing. Speaking on the Mall in Washington, D.C., Smithsonian Under Secretary Robert A. Brooks said Apollo 11 had been a “dramatic demonstration . . . that progress in human affairs does not spring full blown from the efforts of one man or group of men. What we saw was the culmination of the efforts of hundreds of scientists and engineers from Leonardo da Vinci ... to the Apollo 11 astronauts. Each built on what his predecessors had accomplished until the accumulation of knowledge made possible the kind of quantum leap forward represented by the Apollo Program.” Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, called the day of the landing “the day man ended an era of one-planet civilization and began a new age as traveler and colonizer of the universe.” Despite difficulties, men would “make more of these steps into the vast but exciting reaches of the solar system.” A 21 July service at the Washington Cathedral in Washington, D.C., dedicated the Space Window donated by Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator at the time of the landing. The window, designed by Rodney Winfield, depicted whirling orange, red, and white stars and orbiting planets on a deep blue and green field. A thin white trajectory, representing a manned spacecraft, emphasized man’s minuteness in God’s universe. During the ceremony, Armstrong presented a 7.18-g, 3.6-billion-yr-old lunar rock, brought from the moon by Apollo 11, to the Cathedral. The rock would be inserted into a hydrogen-filled plexiglass container embedded as the centerpiece of the window. (PD, 22 July 74, 815; NASA Activities, 15 Aug 74, 5-14; transcript; program)
A 5-million-km hydrogen cloud surrounding Comet Kohoutek was photographed by a Naval Research Laboratory camera aboard a NASA Aerobee 200 sounding rocket. The rocket, launched from White Sands Missile Range, reached an altitude of 193.1 km. The image of the cloud, invisible from the earth because it glowed at an ultraviolet wavelength that did not penetrate the atmosphere, was obtained by photographing the comet in the light of the Lyman-alpha line of atomic hydrogen using a special electronic uv camera. Scientists believed the comet consisted largely of water ice which evaporated as it neared the sun, breaking up into component hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The lighter hydrogen atoms escaped rapidly, producing the cloud. (Naval Research Reviews, Jem 74,29)
Skynet IIB, United Kingdom military communications satellite, arrived at Kennedy Space Center to be prepared for November launch by NASA on a Thor-Delta launch vehicle.

Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider testified before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight in NASA’s FY 1975 authorization hearings on early results from Skylab’s earth resources data. Perhaps the most interesting so far was the unconfirmed indication of mineral deposits near Ely, Nev. The Skylab earth resources experiment package had also identified several areas of citrus fruit fly infestation on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, demonstrated the use of remote sensing for snow mapping, identified new urbanization patterns in Phoenix, Ariz., and inventoried vegetation patterns in California test sites. A Baltimore-Washington area photo and similar imagery for 12 other cities were being used by the Dept, of Interior to test their use for updating the 1970 census. Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, astronaut on the 25 May-22 June 1973 mission to man the Orbital Workshop, testified that Skylab astronauts were healthy, happy, and not under significant stress during their long flights. After initial decreased appetite, an astronaut had a feeling of well-being with normal thirst and appetite, although he had a continued feeling of fullness in the head and tended to assume a peculiar posture with neck extended and moving backwards and elbows, hips, and knees flexed at 20° to 30°. He tended to become sleepy and required frequent exercise to restore vigor and alertness. His voice had a peculiar nasal quality. After the third day he was virtually immune to motion sickness.. Without gravity, there was no automatic sensation of up and down and without vision he could quickly get lost. Dr. Harry C. Gatos, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist and Skylab materials processing investigator, testified Skylab experiments had shown that segments of crystals partially regrown in space exhibited none of the inhomogeneities from dopants (electronically active chemical elements) that characterized earth-grown crystals and inhibited their efficiency. In addition to preparation of special materials for electronic and medical uses, materials processing studies in space would provide an understanding of the structures of materials and permit preparation of materials to perform closer to their theoretical limits. Crystal-growing technology was developing new means to create and store power and could, within five years, provide a practical economic basis for using solar power. (Transcript)

An automated blood pressure monitoring system developed for the NASA integrated medical and behavioral laboratory measurement system (nyiBLMs) program was being evaluated for use in studies on control of high blood pressure, Johnson Space Center announced. Using Skylab technology, the system combined a blood pressure cuff with a pressure ramp programmer for continuous monitoring and a numerical display. Dr. Ted Andrechuk of Texas Tech Univ. was evaluating the system, which was providing hypertensive subjects with biosensory data for a biofeedback conditioning program. The conditioning would allow the patient to lower his blood pressure permanently, (jsc Release 74184) 6, 8, 9 August: The Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee conducted hearings on S. 2350 and S. 3484, bills to establish an Office of Earth Resources Survey Systems within NASA and an Earth Resources Observation Administration within the Dept, of the Interior. Both proposals were designed to move the Earth Resources Technology Satellite system from an experimental to an operational phase. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, opposed the organizational changes proposed by the bills. He argued that S. 2350 would erect barriers in NASA between the erts system and related programs in NASA’s Office of Applications; keeping these programs together would facilitate hardware development and data reduction and handling. S. 3484 would limit NASA’s research and development in earth resources to activities supported and funded by the Dept, of the Interior. Citing the need for more spectral channels, more rapid handling of data, and more frequent repetitive coverage with ERTS-class satellites, Dr. Fletcher stated that there was no clear-cut distinction between experimental and operational phases in the earth resources program. What was needed was “a continuous evolutionary approach, in which operationally useful data from space are provided to users for research, for experimental demonstrations, and for routine operations when they are ready, while at the same time and with the same satellites necessary improvements to the system can be developed and used.” Proponents of the bills argued that erts data would be exploited fully only when users could be guaranteed the continuously available data offered by an operational system. Hearings would be continued 18 Sept. (Transcript)

President Ford as a Congressman had been a “staunch defender of space spending” whenever critics suggested cuts in NASA’s budget, the San Diego Union reported. As minority leader, Ford had declared that the space program could be justified by its spinoffs. In April 1972, Ford had defended a $200-million space shuttle appropriation because he had believed that its loss would end the space program.

Skylab . . . has demonstrated that this nation is capable of conducting broader and more useful beneficial activities in space that directly relate to our own planet Earth,” Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said at a postrecovery press briefing at Johnson Space Center. It had “moved the space program from the realm of the spectacular into a new phase that can be characterized ... as almost businesslike if not yet quite routine.” The Skylab experience was necessary for the future in space and had confirmed that NASA was proceeding in the right direction with development of the space shuttle. Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said 30 earth resources passes had been planned and 39 accomplished during the Skylab 4 mission. There had been 350 hrs of Apollo Telescope Mount observations planned and 338 hrs completed. Observations of Comet Kohoutek included 13 by the Apollo Telescope Mount and 111 by other instruments. All 28 planned corollary experiments and all major medical and student experiments had been completed. Original planning had called for 140 days in orbit for the three manned missions; 172 were accomplished. Skylab’s greatest achievement “was to prove . . . there is no limit in our space research”; the limit “is only our resolve, not our ability to do work, not the ability of men to work and not our technical knowledge.” (Transcript)

Bacteria found frozen in Antarctic ice and soil for a possible 1 million years had grown and reproduced in the laboratory when put into nutrient fluids, the National Science Foundation announced. If the estimate of the age proved correct, the bacteria would be the oldest examples of life ever found on the earth. Results of the project, spdnsored by nsf and nasa’s extraterrestrial life detection program, would add weight to the theory that some forms of life might be frozen into the permafrost of planets such as Mars. The bacteria had been found at a depth of about 130 m near the main U.S. base on Ross Island. Later samples also had been found in Taylor Valley 95 km away. A senior scientist in the project, Dr. Roy E.

Final decision for the launch was pending recommendation of the Failure Review Board set up at Goddard Space Flight Center to investigate the 2nd-stage failure of a Thor-Delta during the 18 Jan. Skynet IIA launch. NASA believed that, with the 2914 Delta, the present family of vehicles could launch any mission, but RCA Corp. had determined that a 30% to 35% increase in the 2914 Thor-Delta capability would permit a 24-channel, rather than the usual 12-channel, satellite to be launched into synchronous orbit, rca and McDonnell Douglas Corp. had agreed to share the cost of the uprating and McDonnell Douglas would reimburse NASA for technical direction. NASA had not agreed to make the new 3914 Thor-Delta a part of its launch family but probably would do so following successful proof flight. The first flight was scheduled for 1975. (Transcript)
Preliminary reports for Skylab principal investigators indicated that large-scale zero-g production facilities in space could manufacture alloys, composites, and crystals of a homogeneity and perfection far greater than that obtainable on the earth, Marshall Space Flight Center announced. A sample from a Skylab brazing experiment demonstrated an almost perfect brazed joint, suggesting that it would be possible to assemble large facilities in space using welding and braizing techniques. Two ends of 2.5-cm tubes of nickel or steel joined with a sleeve by brazing with a silver-copper alloy showed a metallic structure that could not form under gravity conditions. Crystals of germanium selenide, typically 2 to 3 mm on the earth, were grown in zero g to a length of 25 mm with straight edges and no surface structure defects. A mixture of metals that would not form alloys under gravity conditions showed at least some alloying under zero g. A strengthening fiber of silicon carbide whiskers introduced into composite materials was uniformly distributed, suggesting a potential for space production of materials of greater strength and lighter weight, (msfc Release 74-33)
The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications held hearings on the FY 1975 NASA authorization. Dr. William Nordberg, Chief of Goddard Space Flight Center’s Laboratory for Meteorology and Earth Sciences, said data from Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched 23 July 1972) had demonstrated savings in land use planning and regulation of 10 to 100 times conventional costs in both dollars and personnel. Every cloud-free photo taken by the satellite had been sold to the general public at least once. One photo of an Alaskan naval petroleum reserve showed a striking alignment of lakes indicating that the deposits might extend the known petroleum area. Dr. Warren A. Hovis, gsfc scientist, testified that the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (hcmm) satellite to be launched in 1977 would use a thermal mapper, with a resolution of 0.5 km in optimum orbit, to determine maximum daily temperature variations and thermal inertia of surface material, identify mineral resources, map natural and man-made thermal effluent, and investigate geothermal source location by remote sensing. . Data from the seasat-a satellite to be launched in 1978-^-or from one of its follow-on systems—-would provide optimum, minimum-time ship routing around storms and away from adverse wind, waves, currents, and ice conditions, Dr. John R. Apel, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist, testified 6 March. The savings from a one-day decrease in transatlantic crossing time could amount to millions of dollars each year for shipping interests. (Transcript)

New synthetic materials developed from advanced aircraft research at Ames Research Center could be applied to civil aircraft tires and automobile brakes to improve wear and performance, NASA announced. A new polymer, resistant to heat buildup and the Consequent frictional deterioration, promised up to 10 times the normal wear for braking systems. And another new polymer, with unique molecular properties, might provide aircraft tires that could make as many as 200 landings, instead of the customary 100, before retreading was necessary. The new materials would be tested in fleets of hard-use Government trucks and in commercial airline service using Boeing 727 aircraft.

A new flight research program, the NASA terminal-configured vehicle (tcv) program studying problems in aircraft operations near airports, was under way at Langley Research Center. A modified Boeing 737 flying laboratory with its advanced digital electronics equipment would be used to study present and future terminal-area operating environments, precision four-dimensional [longitude, latitude, altitude, time] flight paths, aircraft performance requirements, automatic systems, displays, and pilot workload. Particular emphasis would be given to the human factors and the interaction of crew members. Research tasks would include close-in, minimum noise, curved approaches to touchdown on a runway with zero visibility. Rollout after touchdown and high-speed turnoffs would also be investigated.

Brezhnev of the Soviet Communist Party’s Central Committee. During the Moscow summit meeting, agreements were signed 28-29 June outlining U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation—including exchange of information and scientists—in the fields of energy, housing and other construction, heart research, economics, industry, and technology. In addition, two treaties were signed 3 July limiting antiballistic missile systems and underground nuclear weapon testing. Under the treaties, both countries agreed to one antiballistic missile site each rather than the two originally agreed on in the U.S.-U.S.S.R. treaty signed 26 May 1972, to prohibition of underground nuclear explosions above 150 kt, and to discussions on the dangers of environmental warfare. The treaties were sent to the Senate for ratification 19 Sept. During a 2 July televised address to the Soviet people President Nixon said the joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission, scheduled for July 1975, was “symbolic of the new relationship we are building between our two nations” for several reasons. First, the rocket technology built for war was being used for peace. Second, during the mission the astronauts and cosmonauts would “join with one another—just as we are doing and must continue to do.” Third, the newly standardized docking technology, making international space rescues possible, would make space travel safer “just as our new relationship can make life on earth safer for the people of both our countries.” And, finally, because the process of “working and building together ... is the way that together we can build a . . . peace that will last.” (PD, 8 July 74, 727-763; 23 Sept 74, 1170)
NASA and the Maritime Administration demonstrated that satellites could be used for high-quality ship-to-shore communications in L-band frequencies. Test transmissions from the National Maritime Research Center in New York were relayed by NASA’s Ats 6 Applications Technology Satellite (launched 30 May) to a commercial container ship en route from Virginia to France. Ats 6 could provide two-way communications between ground stations and mobile units operating in a 1080-km-wide area and would permit transmittal of cargo manifests and documentation before ship arrival in port, transmittal of payroll data for shore processing, and remote monitoring of ship machinery performance.

The surface of Jupiter’s moon Io might be composed of evapo-rite salt deposits, rich in sodium and sulfur, NASA reported. A year-long Jet Propulsion Laboratory study had indicated that deposits had resulted from migration of salt-saturated aqueous solutions to Io’s surface from a warm or hot interior followed by loss of the water to space. Salt-rich materials could have been produced by the leaching of carbonaceous meteorites. According to Dr. Fraser P. Fanale, jpl team leader, the deposits could account for Io’s high reflective power, the absence of ice hands, and the dark reddish poles. Sodium vapor emissions from Io had been first reported in February 1973 by Dr. Robert Brown of Harvard Univ. Subsequently, the cloud of sodium was observed to extend more than 320 000 km from Io. In August Dr. Fanale with two other astronomers had proposed explanations for the sodium emissions. Proton bombardment experiments had indicated that sodium and other atoms had been blasted from Io’s surface by the impact of Jupiter’s magnetospheric protons, electrons, and ions and had formed a cloud around Io. Io’s glow, according to intensive spectral studies, resulted from scattering of sunlight by the sodium cloud, (nasa Release 74-315; Fanale et al., Science, 6 Dec 74, 922-5; Matson et al., Astro Journ, 15 Aug 74, L43-6; jpl proj off, interview, 24 Sept 75, nsf Release 74-199)
President Ford signed S. 1283 into P.L. 93—577, the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974, to establish and conduct a national program of basic and applied research and development, including but not limited to demonstrations of practical applications, of all potentially beneficial energy sources and utilization technologies, within the Energy Research and Development Administration. (Text; PD, 6 Jan 75,14) During December: A total of 349 NASA Civil Service employees, including Associate Deputy Administrator Willis H. Shapley, retired under an “early out” retirement plan authorized by the Civil Service Commission-Under the plan employees could retire if they were at least 50 yrs of age and had 20 yrs of service or if they had 25 yrs of service, regardless of age. NASA had requested the retirement authority, which would extend through 28 Feb. 1975, to minimize effects of a reduction in force scheduled for February at Marshall Space Flight Center and of end of FY 1975 ceilings at Headquarters and elsewhere. NASA also announced a plan to reassign some Headquarters employees to Centers. Retirees included 50 at Headquarters, 50 at Goddard Space Flight Center, 78 at Langley Research Center, 68 at msfc, 28 at Lewis Research Center, 26 at Ames Research Center, 16 at Kennedy Space Flight Center, 14 at Johnson Space Flight Center, 10 at Flight Research Center, and 8 at Wallops Flight Center.

Communications Satellite Corp. announced it had signed a contract to provide technical and operational management for the global commercial satellite system owned by the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization. Under the contract, to run through 11 Feb. 1979, ComSatCorp would recommend and implement research and development programs; advise on procuring space segment facilities; negotiate, place, and administer all contracts for space segments; arrange for satellite launch services and support; prepare and coordinate system operations plans; and prepare and coordinate frequency plans for earth stations. (ComSatCorp Release 74-44) 30 Augusta-14 September: NASA launched Ans 1 Netherlands Astronomical Satellite from Western Test Range on a four-stage Scout launch vehicle at 7:08 am PDT (10:08 am edt). The satellite entered an elliptical polar orbit with a 1167-km apogee, 254-km perigee, 99.0-min period, and 98.1° inclination—significantly different from the planned circular orbit—because of a malfunction in the 1st stage of the Scout. Changes in the spacecraft program and scientific instrument operations program were made to accommodate to the actual orbit. Although the orbit hindered the observation program, the primary objective—to increase the scientific knowledge of stellar ultraviolet and x-ray sources—could be achieved. The spacecraft was pointed at the sun, the solar panels were deployed, and fine pointing in a three-axis stabilized condition was established. All three experiments—a hard x-ray experiment provided by the U.S. and a uv telescope and soft x-ray experiment provided by The Netherlands— were turned on by 8 Sept. In-orbit checkout of experiments and spacecraft was completed 13 Sept, and the operational phase of the mission began 14 Sept. Principal effect of the orbit on the scientific program was the loss of observing time. The higher apogee placed the spacecraft in the Van Allen radiation belts longer than planned, creating a more intense radiation background than anticipated. The uv telescope could operate effectively for 70% of each orbit and observe lOth-magnitude stars only when the spacecraft was below 500 km. Only 5th-magnitude or brighter stars were observable most of the time. The U.S. x-ray experiment could make effective observations about 25% of the total possible observing time; the experiment could operate below 700 km but not over the poles or the South Atlantic Anomaly. The soft x-ray experiment consisted of a large-area detector, which was operating similarly to the U.S. experiment, and a grazing-incidence telescope, which was seriously affected by the radiation background. Although much of the acquired data was not usable, most future data might be recovered through improved analysis techniques. Despite the problems, the orbit would provide nine months of full sunlight, rather than the six months expected, permitting reobservations of objects observed during the first three months. In addition, aerodynamic drag would lower the apogee over a period of time, decreasing the passage time through the Van Allen belts. Ans 1 was launched under a Memorandum of Understanding signed 5 June 1970 by NASA and the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite Program Authority (anspa) . NASA provided the x-ray experiment, spacecraft technical support, the Scout launch vehicle and services, and limited tracking and data acquisition. The Netherlands was responsible for the spacecraft design, fabrication, and testing; two experiments; and primary spacecraft command, control, and tracking and data acquisition. Ans 1 was the first satellite to be controlled completely from the European Space Research Organization’s operations center at Darmstadt, Germany. The ans program was managed for NASA by Goddard Space Flight Center under the direction of the Office of Space Science. Langley Research Center had responsibility for the Scout launch vehicle, (nasa mors, 21 Aug, 6 Nov 74; gsfc SSR, 31 Aug 74; gsfc proj mgr, interview, 15 July 75; esro Release, 23 Aug 74)
The Senate passed, by a unanimous vote of 60, H.R. 15572, the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development-Space-Science-Veterans FY 1975 appropriations bill. The bill was passed as reported out by the Senate Committee on Appropriations 15 Aug. plus an amendment to permit NASA to transfer up to 0.5% of its funds between research and development and research and program management programs. The bill appropriated $3,207 billion to NASA, $36 million below the f’Y 1975 budget request and $60.2 million below the FY 1975 authorization signed 22 June. An additional $4,435 million was appropriated in a Special Energy Bill. NASA r&d funds totaled $2,327 billion, construction of facilities $140.2 million, and r&pm $740 million. The Senate approved all budgeted R&D items, including $6.2 million for the Large Space Telescope and $8.0 million for seasat, both of which had been cut from the House appropriation 26 June. A reduction of $15 million from r&d funds was not directed to any specific program because the Committee suggested that NASA was better able to apply this reduction with a minimum disruption in its priorities. Agreeing with the House, the Committee had urged NASA to reprogram funds to begin work on erts-c and said that further reprogramming of funds for Viking would be considered only with the greatest reluctance. Funds for construction of facilities were up $4.5 million from the House appropriation and down $4.3 million from the authorization. The $740 million for r&pm equaled the House appropriation and was down $9.6 million from the authorization. H.R. 15572 had been reported out of the Senate Committee on Appropriations for a first time 1 Aug. with a total NASA appropriation of $3,243 billion. It was returned to the Committee 5 Aug. by the full Senate for additional cuts. The Senate requested a conference with the House to resolve differences in the passed versions.

First wind-tunnel tests of a third-generation X—24 lifting body had been completed by Arnold Engineering Development Center, the Air Force Systems Command announced. A model of the proposed X-24C equipped with phase-change paint was exposed to a mach 6 airflow in a wind tunnel. By photographing the progression of the melt line formed fey the paint, engineers determined where heat built up and how quickly, around a new canopy designed for flights up to six times the speed of sound. The X-24A lifting body had flown test flights from 1969 to 1971 and the X-24B was continuing flights from Edwards Air Force Base in a NASA—usaf research program into concepts for future hypersonic aircraft and returning spacecraft. The X—24C was similar to the B model with the exception of the new canopy and omission of one vertical stabilizer. (afsc Release oip 158.74)

John V. Goldsmith, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist, said the total annual U.S. production of photovoltaic solar cells was 50 to 75 kw, mostly for spacecraft systems. In space, solarcell systems were without parallel but large-scale applications on the earth could not be achieved until systems could be produced in adequate volume at commercially competitive prices. Goldsmith recommended a large-scale photovoltaic technology development program and said that a terrestrial photovoltaic system, with advantages of an inexhaustible energy source and minimal environmental impact, could be reduced in cost from its current $30 per watt to an economically feasible $0.50 per watt by 1985 but would require Federal funding of more than $250 million. Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, NASA Assistant Administrator for Energy Programs, said NASA was continuing investigations of orbiting satellite power stations. A microwave energy project was studying problems of processing large amounts of power. However, an orbiting power station would weigh 11 million kg and require a second-generation shuttle in addition to a nuclear-powered shuttle to put it into synchronous orbit. (Transcript)
NASA’s Explorer 45 (sss-a Small Scientific Satellite launched 15 Nov. 1971) was turned off. The spacecraft had been investigating the causes of worldwide magnetic disturbances associated with large solar flares. Major accomplishments of Explorer 45 included the first measurement by satellite of man-made stimulated electromagnetic emissions in the magnetosphere; first measurements of alpha particles in the equatorial region of the magnetosphere, where they were 100 times more numerous than expected; first detailed analysis of the interaction of electromagnetic waves with charged particles; measurement of the earth’s ring current, which produced the magnetic storm main phase; and measurement of the closest approach to the earth of the boundary of the magnetosphere at about 25 000-km altitude.

Experts from various fields discussed a new age-oriented global culture, the probability of widespread famine, the prolonged disruption of technological economies by high oil prices, and the spread of nuclear power beyond control of the great powers. Seminar participants concluded that the intensification of nationalism would continue, particularly in response to economic stresses. Speakers from the high-technology sector, however, stressed that the U.S. would not have to suffer from scarcity of resources, although resource extraction would be more expensive and would require new technology. Satellite reconnaissance to find mineral resources and to monitor threats to the global environment would still be necessary. The group also proposed surveillance to track all asteroids crossing the earth’s orbit so that the impact of an asteroid might not be mistaken for a nuclear attack. Communications satellites were considered both useful for uniting countries and dangerous in their potential to increase threats of demagoguery. Many participants agreed that the time for uncontrolled free enterprise was passing and that we would require independent agencies for both planning and technology assessment, exempt from the special interests of particular government departments. Specialists also proposed that NASA’s planning and analytical abilities be applied to national concerns in their full complexity, taking into account world economic, political, and social problems.

Tentative NASA plans for launching 810 payloads into space in the next two decades were outlined by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in an address before the National Space Club in Washington, D.C. The total, for late 1973 to 1991, included non-NASA payloads for Government agencies (other than the Dept, of Defense), foreign agencies, and private industry. The tentative payload model—presented to Congress in October 1973 to show “what could be done in the 1980s” when the space shuttle was in use—included as many as 10 missions to the outer planets Uranus, Neptune, Jupiter, and Saturn. In 1990 and 1991 two very heavy payloads might be sent to orbit one of Jupiter’s moons and land an instrument package. Tentative missions to the inner planets included five missions to Venus, one of them with a lander, and two spacecraft to orbit Mercury. Tentative Mars missions included one spacecraft to orbit the planet, two landers, and two to return samples from the two moons of Mars. Lunar missions under consideration included a lunar polar orbiter in 1979, two other orbiters in the 1980s, two lunar rovers in the 1980s, a lunar halo satellite to ensure communications with the hidden side of the moon, and two lunar rovers in 1990 and 1991 that could return samples to the earth from any point on the moon. Other plans under consideration were a flyby and rendezvous with Comet Encke and a landing on the nucleus, a flyby of Haley’s Comet in 1985, and two missions to asteroids in 1986. Of the 810 total payloads, 57 were designated for planetary exploration and 753 for earth orbit. Scientific satellites for earth orbit were Large Space Telescopes, High Energy Astronomical Observatories, Large Solar Observatories, Large Radio Astronomy Observatories, and x-ray telescopes. The large spacecraft would be unmanned but visited regularly by space shuttle crews and brought back to earth for refurbishing. In the applications field were large Earth Observatory Satellites. And NASA expected to orbit 120 communications and navigation satellites for other agencies or private industry through 1991, not including those for DOD. Of some 300 payloads to be flown in the Spacelab, most would be NASA payloads in the fields of astronomy, physics, earth observations, earth and ocean physics, communication and navigation, life science, and space technology. Of non-NASA payloads, 10 would be for private industry space processing, beginning in 1985. Some 10% were expected to be flown for foreign users. The large number of contemplated missions, even with the increasing number of U.S.S.R. launches, was expected to have very little impact on the environment. Effects of the major constituents of the solid-fueled rocket booster exhaust—water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and aluminum oxide—would be negligible. (Text)

NASA launched Symphonie 1, French and West German experimental communications satellite, at 9:39 pm est from Eastern Test Range on a three-stage, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta launch vehicle. The 402-kg satellite entered a transfer orbit with a 38 071-km apogee, 402-km perigee, 688.2-min period, and 13.2° inclination. Nine seconds after the Thor-Delta’s 3rd stage separated from the 2nd stage, the inertial measurement unit (the altitude-sensing portion in the 2nd-stage guidance system) stopped functioning, but the failure did not affect the path of the already separated 3rd stage. In addition, the main engine cutoff was achieved by fuel depletion with 430 kg liquid oxygen remaining instead of with the planned depletion. The anomalies, which did not affect the mission, were under investigation. Ground controllers in West Germany activated the apogee kick motor, the first using liquid propellant, at 6:00 pm est 21 Dec., putting the spacecraft in circular geosynchronous orbit with 35 810-km apogee, 35 767-km perigee, 23-hr 56-min period, and 0.3° inclination. The spacecraft was despun and three-axis-stabilized and its large solar panels were successfully deployed 24 Dec. Symphonie 1 drifted eastward to its final station at 115° W longitude over the west coast of Africa and began operations 2 Jan. 1975. The NASA mission objective—to launch the spacecraft into a transfer orbit that would permit the onboard propulsion system to place it in an accurate synchronous orbit—was satisfied and the mission was adjudged successful 6 Jan. Symphonie 1 would provide 1200 telephone circuits, 8 voice channels, and 2 color TV channels for experimental communications between Europe, Africa, and South America. The first of two Symphonie satellites, provided for by a French-West Germany agreement signed June 1967, the satellite was developed by a French-German industrial consortium under the direction of the French Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (cnes) and the West German Gesell-schaft fur Weltraumforschung (Gfw). In October 1973 NASA agreed to provide the launch vehicle and services on a cost-reimbursable basis and in June 1974 signed a launch services contract with CNES-Gfw.

Ames Research Center scientist Dr. Theodore Wydeven, Jr., had developed a new technique for coating salt lenses, NASA announced. Lenses made from large salt crystals had long been used in scientific applications because they were transparent to infrared light, but they were susceptible to fogging from even slight moisture. Using a method from his water purification experiments, Dr. Wydeven had prepared a Teflon-like membrane in an electric discharge to coat a salt lens, at a few cents a coating. The coating increased resistance to moisture and enhanced optical quality of the lens because of the film’s antireflection properties.

A helical rotary-screw expander that could he used to tap geothermal energy of hot aquifers under deserts for low-cost energy was described at a National Science Foundation conference at California Institute of Technology. The invention of Pasadena engineer Roger S. Sprankle was the first electrical power-generating system to use the entire amount of energy available in geothermally heated water and might reduce production costs 50%. Tested by Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Hydrothermal Power Co., the Sprankle system’s rotary screws filtered impurities to make maximum use of the steady flow of pumped water. Once the geothermally heated water flowed through the screw expanders, the liquid dropped in pressure and temperature as water vaporized.

The first Apollo lunar surface experiment package (alsep), placed on the moon by Apollo 12 astronauts in November 1969, had far exceeded its one-year life expectancy and was still functioning, along with instruments in alsep packages from Apollo 14 through 17, nasa announced. From alsep magnetometers, Dr. Palmer Dyal, Ames Research Center lunar investigator, had calculated that the moon had a magnetic field 1000 times weaker than the earth’s, with an iron content about 9% by weight, in contrast to the earth’s 30%. The heat flow measured by alsep instruments was half the earth’s, indicating differentiation and upward concentrations of radioactivity early in the moon’s history. Seismometers had uncovered a new class of moonquakes originating at depths of 100 km or less below the lunar surface. Dr. M. Nafi Toksoz of Massachusetts Institute of Technology earlier had reported that preliminary information indicated the moon had a small core less than 800 km across, lying inside a molten shell 600-1000 km down from the surface, where deep moonquakes had been detected. Seismic, magnetic, and heat-flow data had also suggested that the moon was further along than the earth in its evolutionary history, (nasa Release 74-313; NASA prog off, interview, 17 Nov 75; McElheny, NYT, 18 Nov 74)
The X-24B lifting body successfully completed its first supersonic flight near Flight Research Center, in the joint NASA-Air Force program to develop a hypersonic vehicle for reentry from space and technology for future aircraft capable of sustained cruise at hypersonic speeds. Piloted by John A. Manke and launched from a B-52 aircraft at 13 700 m, the research vehicle reached an altitude of 18 400 m and speed of mach 1.09. The powered flight satisfied the primary objectives of obtaining stability and control data at mach 1.1 for power-off and power-on conditions, performance and longitudinal trim data at mach 0.8 and 0.9, and pressure data on both fins for identification of asymmetric flow.

Pioneer 11, launched 5 April 1973 toward a December 1974 encounter with Jupiter, was retargeted to pass within 42 000 km of Jupiter and then, with a gravity assist from the planet, fly on to Saturn in 1979. Ground controllers at Ames Research Center commanded the spacecraft’s onboard thrusters to fire for 42 min 36 sec, increasing velocity 230 km per hr. On its new course, Pioneer 11 would pass Jupiter nearer the south polar region, intersecting the planet’s equatorial plane at 55°, and come three times closer than Pioneer 10 had during its 3 Dec. 1973 encounter, (nasa mor, 5 Nov 74; NASA Release 74-94; arc Release 74-10)

A House-Senate Conference Committee favorably reported a compromise version of H.R. 15572, the FY 1975 Dept, of Housing and Urban Development-Space-Science-Veterans appropriations bill that included a $3.207-billion NASA appropriation. NASA funds were $40,394 million below the budget request and $60,194 million less than the FY 1975 authorization. An additional $4,435 million for energy research and development was appropriated separately. The compromise appropriation was close to the one passed by the Senate 16 Aug. and $3,685 million above the $3,203 billion approved by the House 26 June.

Fraudulent transmissions to Johnson Space Center purporting to be from Skylab 4 astronauts, working in the Orbital Workshop since their 16 Nov. 1973 launch, were heard during a telephone call to New York City from Unifi, Inc., in North Carolina. The supposed astronauts described “an approximately 10-megaton explosion” on the spacecraft as they took military photos of silos over Moscow. After the “astronauts” said they were sending scrambled messages “on channel 5 and channel B,” they were heard supposedly speaking to President Nixon at the White House. They acknowledged that their wives had been notified and were being flown to Houston. The voices then reported that their “secret documents and equipment” had been jettisoned. The transmissions then abruptly ended. The press later reported that 12 other persons had heard similar “space messages.” A Houston area telephone company employee was later'taken into custody.

Design work on the primary rescue system for space shuttle passengers proceeded at Johnson Space Center. A prototype “beach ball” large enough for a person to crawl into, zip up, and pressurize had been demonstrated and given a go-ahead at NASA Hq. in December 1973. Assistant Chief for Shuttle Larry E. Bell in jsc’s Crew Systems Div. had told a news interviewer the balls could be packaged into cylinders to accompany each passenger aboard the shuttle in the 1980s, “almost like a parachute.” Simplicity, size, light weight, structural strength of the ball shape, and low cost had won approval over expensive and complicated spacesuits for nonastronauts on flights and eliminated the requirement for a rescue docking module. In an emergency, passengers could enter the balls—each with its own window—an hour or two before rescue by a second shuttle. Oxygen containers connected to the shuttle supply system would be used until just before rescue; a device would remove carbon dioxide. Once disconnected, each container would last an hour; transfer through space to the rescue shuttle was expected to take 30 min. (Bell interview, 4 March 75; Hill, H Chron, 21 April *74)
An omnidirectional wheel that could change a vehicle’s direction of movement without changing the direction it was facing had been developed by Marshall Space Flight Center engineer Josef F. Blumrich, MSEC announced. The rim of the wheel consisted of several barrel-shaped segments that rotated independently when in contact with the ground. The wheel, which would be strong enough to negotiate rough terrain, could be used on a planetary explorer vehicle or on wheelchairs, (msfc Release 74-53) _

Tass announced that the flight of the U.S.S.R.’s Salyut 3 orbiting space station, launched 25 June, would soon end, after completion of a six-month program that doubled the flight duration originally planned. During its six months operation the spacecraft had performed more than 400 scientific and technical experiments, received more than 8000 control commands from the earth, conducted more than 200 “dynamic operations,” conducted 70 TV transmission and 2500 telemetric sessions, fired its thrusters more than 500 000 times, and generated 5000 kw of electricity with its solar panels. A two-man crew, launched 3 July on Soyuz 14, boarded the space station and spent 15 days living and working in space. A second crew, launched 26 Aug. on Soyuz 15, failed in several attempts to dock with the station and returned to the earth after 48 hrs in space. Since that time Salyut 3 had operated in an unmanned automatic mode. The Western press later speculated that the mission was being ended to prevent any interference with the mission of Salyut 4 [see 26 Dec.—9 Feb. 1975]. The retrorockets were fired 24 Jan. 1975 and the station reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean after 213 days in space. (Tass, fbis-Sov, 26 Dec 74, Ul-2; 24 Jan 75, Ul; gsfc SSR, 28 Feb 75; Soviet Aero, 6 Jan 75,1) 26 December—9 February 1975: The U.S.S.R. launched Salyut 4 space station into earth orbit and 16 days later launched Soyuz 17 with a two-man crew to join the Salyut and establish a manned orbital laboratory. Salyui 4 was launched 26 Dec. from Baykonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam into orbit with a 252-km apogee, 214-km perigee, 89.2-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass announced the purpose of the mission was to test the design, onboard systems, and equipment and to conduct scientific studies and experiments in space. The news agency also reported that onboard systems and equipment were operating normally. The Western press reported that major maneuvers 29 and 30 Dec. put the station at a record high altitude for a Salyut space station, reaching an orbit with a 350-km apogee and 337-km perigee by 31 Dec. Soyuz 17, launched at 2:43 am 11 Jan. 1975 local time (4:43 pm est 10 Jan.) from Baykonur Cosmodrome, carried cosmonauts Lt. Col. Aleksey A. Gubarev and Georgy M. Grechko into orbit with a 249-km apogee, 186-km perigee, 88.9-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass announced the mission would carry out joint experiments with Salyut 4, including a comprehensive checkup of the spacecraft’s onboard systems in various flight conditions. In a launch-day interview with Tass, Maj. Gen. Georgy T. Beregovoy, head of the Soviet cosmonaut training center, said that Soyuz 17- was in “no way connected with additional checkups of ‘Soyuz’ systems before its rendezvous with ‘Apollo.’ ” An orbital correction raised the spacecraft to an orbit with a 354km apogee, 293-km perigee, 90.7-min period, and 51.6° inclination, permitting Soyuz 17 to dock with Salyut 4 on 12 Jan. The spacecraft was moved automatically to a distance of 10 m from the station and then the cosmonauts completed docking by manual control. The crew entered the space station, switched on the power and radio transmitters, and inspected the scientific equipment. In a 14 Jan. interview with Tass, Dr. Konstantin P. Feoktistov, cosmonaut who had helped design the space station, said that Salyut 4 improvements included three panels of solar batteries that were positioned like the tail of an aircraft and could be individually oriented toward the sun. The panels permitted the energy supply in the station to be replenished without using fuel for spacecraft orientation. Other improvements had been introduced in the flight control systems. During a broadcast from the spacecraft over Moscow Radio 15 Jan., Gubarev and Grechko said they had set up the first Soviet space-based teletype communications station. The teletype could receive and copy communications from the earth while the cosmonauts were busy at other tasks. Tass reported 17 Jan. that the cosmonauts, neither of whom had been in space before, had become accustomed to weightlessness about the fifth or sixth day of flight. During nearly 30 days aboard Salyut 4, Gubarev and Grechko used a newly developed high-resolution solar telescope to study solar phenomena, x-ray telescopes and sensors to study the flux of x-radiation from celestial bodies, and an infrared spectrometer to examine the earth’s radiation. The cosmonauts also studied effects of weightlessness on the human vestibular function, cardiovascular system, and blood; made earth resources observations; and studied the earth’s upper atmosphere. They resprayed two telescope mirrors dulled by exposure to space; carried out biological “Oasis” experiments using insects, microorganisms, tissue cultures, and plants; and tried recycling water, condensed from the cabin atmosphere, for drinking and food preparation. The crew began preparations for their return to earth 9 Feb., transferring equipment to Soyuz 17. The cosmonauts boarded Soyuz 17 and undocked from the space station at 11:08 am Baykonur time (1:08 am est). Soyuz 17 softlanded in the U.S.S.R. 110 km northeast of Tselino-grad, Kazakhstan, “in complex meteorological conditions” after 29 days 13 hrs 20 min in space. The Soyuz 17 cosmonauts had broken the previous 23-day 18-hr 22-min Soviet record for time in space set by the Soyuz 11 crew on Salyut 1 (6-30 June 1971) before they were killed during reentry. On-the-spot and later medical checks showed that the Soyuz 17 cosmonauts had “withstood well the long space flight.” Salyut 4 was the fourth space station orbited by the U.S.S.R. Salyut 1 had been launched 19 April 1971. A three-man crew, launched on Soyuz 10, docked with the station 24 April but returned to earth without entering. The Soyuz 11 crew, launched 6 June 1971, boarded the station and conducted scientific experiments for 24 days before their reentry tragedy. Salyut 2 was launched into orbit 3 April 1973, but an explosion or wildly firing thrusters sent the station out of control, tearing off the solar panels and making the station uninhabitable. Salyut 3 was orbited 25 June 1974 [see 25 Dec.], (gsfc Wkly SSR, 19-25 Dec 74; gsfc SSR, 31 Dec 74; 28 Feb 75; Tass, fbis—Sov, 31 Dec 74^13 Feb 75; SF, June 75, 235; April 75, 144—5; O’Toole, W Post, 31 Dec 74, A7; upi, NYT, 16 Jan 75,14; SBD, 14 Jan 75, 62; LC, S&T News Alert 2645)
Josef Boehm, rocket pioneer from Peenemuende, Germany, and Chief of Marshall Space Flight Center’s Electromechanical Engineering Div., died at the age of 65. An associate professor of kinematics before joining Dr. Wemher von Braun in 1939 at the Rocket Research Center in Peenemuende, Boehm came to the United States in November 1945 with Dr. von Braun under U.S. contract. He was instrumental in designing and engineering the first U.S. spacecraft for the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, beginning with Explorer 1 (launched 31 Jan. 1958), and continued with msfc after it was formed in 1960. He had a major role in developing the Skylab Workshop’s Apollo Telescope Mount. (Marshall Star, 9 Jan 74,4; Huntsville Times, 1 Jan 74)
The prototype Mini-Sniffer, a small 55-kg radio-controlled aircraft equipped to test pollution in the upper atmosphere, made the first of a series of eight flights from Flight Research Center. The vehicle, powered by a 9-kw gasoline engine, maintained an altitude of 15-30 m and performed well at 55-87 km per hr. The purpose of the flight was to test airworthiness at lower altitudes and speeds. Another series of flights would check out the auto-pilot system at low altitude and then the aircraft would be taken to 6100 m, using radar and a long-range radiocontrol system. The Mini-Sniffer would eventually be fitted with an 11kw engine which would carry it up to 21 000 m. (frc X-Press, 2 Aug 74, 30 Aug 74; frc proj off, interview, 24 July 75)

Scientists using the 305-m dish antenna at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico had discovered a pulsar—a pulsating radio source—orbiting a companion celestial object in the constellation Aquila, the New York Times reported. Both pulsar and the object weighed as much as the sun but were only a few kilometers in diameter. It was the first pulsar discovered circling another object, a phenomenon which made it possible for scientists to estimate its mass. Its orbit had been calculated from the slight variations in its pulse rate. While it was possible that the companion was a black hole, scientists thought it more likely that both were neutron stars and a search was continuing to find out if the companion was a very weak pulsar.

The Library of Congress Congressional Research Service published United States and Soviet Progress in Space: Summary Data through 1972 and a Forward Look (74-35SP), prepared by Dt. Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of the Science Policy Research Div. In its manned program the U.S.S.R. had launched a Salyut 2 space station 3 April 1973 but a failure—possibly a wildly firing thruster—had damaged the station, which reentered the earth’s atmosphere May 28. Other later attempts to launch and man a space station also appeared to have failed. Two manned launches, Soyuz 12 and Soyuz 13, had been successful in September and December, the second spacecraft remaining in space eight days to conduct astrophysical, biological, and earth resources experiments. By 30 June 1974 the United States expected to have spent $75 billion on combined military and civilian space programs since the beginning of the space program, spending about $4.7 billion in FY 1974. The Soviet Union did not publish space budget data, but its program was thought to be “at least of the same magnitude as that of the United States at its former peak” of $7.7 billion a year. The U.S. had several major space research and development centers operated by the military and private industry as well as NASA. There was no reason to believe the Soviet aerospace industry was as fully equipped but missiles of similar capabilities and different design philosophies which had appeared in Moscow parades “suggest the existence of more than one design and development team for space work.” The U.S. had launch vehicles scaled to lift payloads weighing from 9 kg to 136 000 kg. The Soviet Union had started to use in 1957 its original intercontinental ballistic missile and still used the same basic vehicle with stages added to improve performance. The very large Soviet vehicle predicted by NASA officials had not been seen. A Soviet lunar landing did not seem imminent but was still expected, as part of Soviet long-range plans, as soon as the problems of unreliable hardware were solved. U.S.—U.S.S.R. cooperation in space efforts was “the hope of well-intentioned people everywhere.” Two motives for cooperation were to lessen tension and to save money. Although there was already exchange of information between scientists and engineers, “no assessment of the overall prospects can be made successfully without forecasting the future political climate.” (Text) Despite the loss of the prime power chain, causing automatic transfer to the backup system, Mariner 10’s instruments continued scientific studies. Comet Kohoutek’s tail was observed in the extreme ultraviolet range. On 13 Jan. hydrogen Lyman-alpha intensity, beginning 20° from the comet’s nucleus, climbed rapidly as the nucleus region drifted toward the uv airglow spectrometer’s field of view. The nucleus was scanned 16 Jan. On 17 Jan., while the spacecraft was powered down for its second trajectory correction maneuver, shutting off several instrument heaters allowed the TV optics heaters, which had failed to function earlier, to turn on. Scientists had feared that below-freezing temperature might prevent camera operation during the Venus encounter. On 21 Jan., instruments for Comet Kohoutek and solar wind experiments were turned on. On 22 Jan. the uv spectrometer measured hydrogen Lyman-alpha intensities out to 17° to map the comet’s hydrogen cloud. Comet Kohoutek was scanned seven hours 24 Jan. by the UV spectrometer—the only instrument of its kind to observe the comet from outside the earth’s own hydrogen cloud. During the seventh and final roll calibration maneuver 28 Jan., telemetry indicated a rapid increase in the use of attitude control gas, the nitrogen gas supply dropping from 2.7 to 2.1 kg. The gyros were turned off and the spacecraft put into celestial control, with the sun and the star Canopus as references. Nitrogen-gas-use rate returned to normal and estimates of the supply indicated a comfortable margin for reaching Mercury and executing experiments. The backup electric power system was still in use, as studies of that problem continued. On 31 Jan. Mariner 10 was 3 200 000 km from Venus and 38 800 000 km from the earth, traveling at 30 238 km per hr.

Rep. Charles A. Vanik (D-Ohio) said that he was becoming impatient waiting “for an energy efficient* American automobile which can meet our pollution standards.” It was “time we truly involved NASA—on a massive scale—in solving our earth-bound problems.” Carl E. Nash of the Public Interest Research Group suggested that serious consideration be given the Dept, of Transportation or the Environmental Protection Agency, rather than NASA, when giving authority for ground propulsion research and development, because these agencies had had more experience in the field. Sydney L. Terry, Vice President for Public Responsibility and Consumer Affairs at Chrysler Corp., said many had questioned whether the Federal Government had a legitimate role in automotive propulsion technology, but Chrysler would “welcome NASA’s interest in the automobile with enthusiasm and hope.” NASA’s skill and experience in long-range basic research and in the fields of thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and aerodynamics could contribute substantially to the development of efficient transportation. The way to proceed was by a “thoughtful division of research and development work between Government and industry.” (Transcript)

Construction of the $22-million runway for the space shuttle was begun at Kennedy Space Center after a brief ground-breaking ceremony at the construction site northwest of the Vehicle Assembly Building. Dr. Debus, KSC Director, said the shuttle would lead to a “new era of international transportation to and from space” and the “boom and bust of the 1960s of this community and the activities of the government will be changed to a more steady—more reliable—situation.” The 90-m wide, 4600-m long, 40-cm thick runway would accommodate a 75 000-kg spacecraft returning from space at a 15° to 20° angle and at a speed of nearly 295 km per hr. More than 8000 km of grooves in the surface would permit drainage and prevent hydroplaning while " landing in the rain. To reduce the speed of the returning shuttle, astronauts would have the help of brakes, parachutes, and a net at the end of the runway. The runway was scheduled for July 1976 completion.

The Titan IIIE-Centaur proof-flight vehicle (TC-1), launched by NASA from Eastern Test Range Complex 41 at 9:48 am edt carrying a Viking spacecraft model and the sphinx satellite, was destroyed after the Centaur engine failed to start. At 8.1 min from launch, after normal separation from the Titan booster, the Centaur main-engine start failed and the vehicle automatically went into the restart sequence. A second attempt to start the engine failed at 9.2 min after liftoff. Since the vehicle had not achieved orbital velocity the Range Safety Officer at the Antigua, West Indies, tracking station transmitted destruction commands and the Centaur was destroyed at 12,5 min after the liftoff. The vehicle fell into the Atlantic Ocean 3530 km downrange. Inflight data indicated that the liquid-oxygen boost pump had failed to operate during both attempted engine starts. A committee was formed to investigate the failure and recommend corrective action. Although the primary objective of demonstrating the capability of the Titan-Centaur launch vehicle was not accomplished, some objectives were fulfilled: demonstration of the capability of the launch facility to support a Titan-Centaur launch, structural integrity of the vehicle, Centaur guidance and control of the Titan, Titan-Centaur separation, and Centaur standard shroud capability. The Viking Dynamic Simulator had been instrumented to verify flight loads for the two planned 1975 missions to Mars. Remaining attached to the Centaur stage, the vds was to have flown a typical Viking launch trajectory with a shortened bum to limit the spacecraft to a low earth orbit, to test the guidance system, and estimate injection accuracy. The sphinx Space Plasma High Voltage Interaction Experiment spacecraft had been intended for launch into an elliptical orbit to investigate the effect of charged particles in space on high-voltage solar cells, insulators, and conductors. The launch vehicle combined NASA’s versatile high-energy liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen Centaur upper stage with the Air Force-developed Titan III booster, a two-stage liquid-propellant core rocket augmented by two strap-on solid-fueled rocket motors. It was designed to fill the performance and cost gap between the Atlas-Centaur and the Saturn vehicles and boost NASA’s heaviest unmanned payloads into orbit or interplanetary trajectories. The first of six scheduled operational missions—the U.S. and West German Helios solar probe scheduled for the fall—would be configured to a two-burn mission to obtain data lost on the proof flight. The Titan-Centaur program was managed by NASA’s Office of Space Science. Lewis Research Center was responsible for the Titan-Centaur system. The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Organization was responsible for the Titan IIIE booster, including aerospace ground equipment and Launch Complex 41 site activation. Kennedy Space Center directed launch operations at etr. (NASA mors, 25 Jan, 24 June 74; NASA Release 74r-25; UPI, W Post, 12 Feb 74, A2; Robinson, Today, 13 Feb 74)
Marshall Space Flight Center awarded a 90-day $950 000 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to Thiokol Chemical Corp. for studies, analysis, planning, and design required to define the interface and performance relationships of the solid-fueled rocket motor to the solid-fueled rocket boosters, external tank, and orbiter of the sDace shuttle. Award of the 90-day contract was necessary to continue the overall development schedule of the total space shuttle system. A contract award to Thiokol in November 1973 to develop the motors for the shuttle had been delayed pending the resolution of a protest filed by Lockheed Propulsion Co. (NASA Release 74-130; Huntsville Times, 17 Feb 74)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released the budget statement he had given at a 2 Feb. press briefing. The FY 1975 NASA budget plan for new authorization of $3,247 billion and spending of $3,273 billion, although a “constrained budget,” would carry forward the programs planned in FY 1974. Goals and major programs were the same, with three new projects in space science and applications, but the space shuttle had been slipped four to six months. NASA’s FY 1974 budget had “reflected a sharp temporary reduction, because of Government-wide fiscal problems . . . , below the $3.4 billion level previously planned as the long-term level.” Increases in FY 1975 and later years were therefore “in order to approach again the level required to maintain . . . advances in space and aeronautics for the rest of the decade.” The FY 1975 increase of “about $100 million,” however, was less than required to return to NASA’s complete program as planned, and adjustments had been necessary. Principally, the first manned orbital flight of the shuttle was rescheduled to the second quarter of 1979, instead of the end of 1978, but NASA had a “firm commitment now” that there would be no more slips for budgetary reasons, and none was expected for technical reasons. NASA Comptroller William E. Lilly said at the briefing the stretchout was expected to increase shuttle costs about $50 million “in 1971 dollars.” The $800 million requested for the shuttle was $89 million less than NASA had submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. In the three new space flight projects, Pioneer Venus had top scientific priority as the next step in planetary exploration. Two missions launched in 1978 would study the Venus atmosphere for a better understanding of that planet and of the earth’s atmosphere, meteorology, and climatology. In the second new start, seasat, an experimental applications satellite, would measure ocean characteristics to aid scientific understanding of ocean dynamics and determine if a forecasting system could be developed, seasat-a was to be launched in 1978. The third start, the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (hcmm), would launch an Explorer satellite in 1977 to make thermal measurements of the earth’s surface to help find mineral resources and potential geothermal energy sources and to discriminate rock structures for planning civil works such as highways. NASA was asking $6 million to build the world’s first large infrared telescope, on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, for planetary research to complement planetary space flights, especially to provide data for the 1977 launch of the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probe. Another new thrust, still in the planning stage, was the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss) , to return the large amounts of data expected from the shuttle in the 1980s and permit phase-out of some tracking stations. NASA would not develop the spacecraft for the TDRSS but would lease satellite services from a private organization, beginning in CY1979. Analysis of data from the Skylab missions that were ending with the 8 Feb. splashdown of Skylab 4 would continue for many years. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project joint engineering and training activities with the U.S.S.R. were on schedule. All shuttle hardware prime contractors and most subcontractors had been selected, and the Dept, of Defense tentatively planned to modify an existing upper stage for use as an interim space tug with, the shuttle. Erts 1, launched 23 July 1972, was still working well, exceeding its design life by more than six months. ERTS-b, previously planned for 1976 launch, had been moved to 1975. A number of nasa and 11 commercial applications launches were scheduled during the year. A nominal communications satellite research program would be continued. In space astronomy, oso-i was scheduled for 1975 and the heAo series would be resumed, with launches planned for 1977, 1978, and 1979. Astronautics programs would continue to develop technology to improve fuel economy, reduce noise, and improve performance of U.S.-built civil transport aircraft. nasa’s Civil Service employment was to be stabilized at the end of FY 1974 levels except for a further reduction of 354 persons at Marshall Space Flight Center following completion of Skylab. NASA’s FY 1975 total would be 24 616, about 2200 less than in FY 1973 and 354 less than in FY 1974. Support service contractors at the Centers had reductions planned at about the same level, the 25 000 FY 1973 total dropping to 24 000 in FY 1974 and to 22 000 in FY 1975.

Lewis Research Center awarded an $800 000 cost-sharing contract, of which the Government would supply $500 000, to Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Div. of United Aircraft Corp. in NASA’s experimental clean combustor program. Pratt & Whitney was to maintain the already low smoke emissions of its JT8D (Class T4) aircraft engine, while reduc
Charles A. Lindbergh—the first man to fly solo nonstop from New York to Paris, in 1927—died of cancer on Maui, Hawaii, at the age of 72. He was buried three hours later in a simple funeral near the Kipahulu church on Maui. In Washington, President Ford said: “Nearly half a century has passed since his courageous solo flight . . . but the courage and daring of his feat will never be forgotten. For years to come, we will also remember the selfless, sincere man himself . .., one of America’s alltime heroes and a great pioneer of the air age that changed the world.” For the transatlantic flight, airmail pilot and barnstormer Lindbergh had helped design a Ryan monoplane, calculating every ounce. When the Spirit of St. Louis landed at Le Bourget airfield, Paris, at 10:22 pm 21 May 1927 after a 33-hr 29-min flight, Lindbergh was greeted by 25 000 wildly cheering persons. British, French, and Belgian governments awarded the flyer their highest decorations for valor. He received the first U.S. Distinguished Flying Cross and the Medal of Honor and was promoted from lieutenant to colonel in the Army Air Corps Reserve. Following goodwill flights throughout the U.S. and Latin America, sponsored by the Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics, Lindbergh served as adviser to Pan American World Airways and to the predecessor of Trans World Airlines, helping to lay out transatlantic, transcontinental, and Caribbean air routes for commercial aviation. He served as a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 1931-1939, heading the special committee that recommended to Congress expansion of U.S. aircraft research facilities and establishment of what became the Ames and Lewis Research Centers. After the kidnaping and murder of his first son and the subsequent publicity, Lindbergh moved to Europe in 1935, where he studied the military forces of the European countries. His conclusion that the German Luftwaffe would be superior to the combined forces of the Allies, his acceptance of the Service Cross of the German Eagle from the German government, and his opposition to U.S. participation in World War II provoked the U.S. public to question his patriotism and he resigned his commission in the Army Air Corps. During the war he was a consultant to bomber aircraft manufacturers Ford Motor Co. and United Aircraft Corp. He traveled to the Pacific war area in 1944 to study the Navy’s Corsair F-4U under flying conditions and there, as a civilian, flew 50 missions against the Japanese. Following the war, his commission restored and promoted to the rank of brigadier general, Lindbergh was a technical consultant for Government and private industry in missile and space flight programs. As a consultant for Pan Am he worked on design specifications for the Boeing 747. Lindbergh devoted the later years of his life to writing and speaking on world conservation policies.

A nine-month, $321 394 study contract to provide NASA with engineering concepts, requirements, and design trade-offs for a zero-gravity atmospheric-cloud-physics-experiment laboratory to fly on the space shuttle had been awarded to McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., Marshall Space Flight Center announced. The proposed laboratory would permit study of “trigger” actions in clouds, such as the formation of ice crystals or water droplets, electrical charges on droplets, and waterdroplet—icecrystal interactions to aid in the ultimate control and modification of hazardous weather conditions. The laboratory could be reused on at least 20 Spacelab missions. ( msfc Release 74-27; msfc pao)
NASA and the National Science Foundation announced an agreement to design, construct, and test an experimental 100-kw wind turbine generator at Lewis Research Center. The large windmill would be tested to determine performance and characteristics of systems for future commercial production of electric power [see 11 Jan]. (NASA Release 74-63)
A galaxy six times larger than any previously known in the universe had been discovered by an international team of astronomers using The Netherlands’ Westerbork radio telescope, the Washington Post reported. Named 3C 268, the galaxy was 18 million light years in length and 1.8 billion light years from the earth. It was composed of an optical galaxy—a group of stars emitting visible light—at the center, with enormous gaseous radio components spreading like giant propeller blades on either side. (AP, W Post, 31 Aug 74, A13) During August: Flight Research Center began wake vortex studies with a Boeing 747 to test different configurations and mechanical devices for suppressing the formation or reducing the strength of vortices. Wind-tunnel and water-channel tests had indicated that engine-induced turbulence and span-load tailoring by flap modification would permit reduction of standard separation distances between aircraft. Removing the outboard flap on a model of a Boeing 747 and adding a trailing spline reduced the wing-tip vortex so that the separation between a Boeing 747 and a following Lear jet or DC-9 could be reduced from 8 to less than 3 km. During inflight tests, lowering the inboard flap 30° dissipated the normal wing-tip vortex as a second vortex flowing in a counter direction formed. Flight testing would continue into September, (frc X-Press, 13,27 Sept 74; NASA Release 74-230)
Goddard Space Flight Center launched an Aerobee 200 sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range to study Comet Kohoutek’s ultraviolet rays. The rocket carried cameras, spectrometers, and other instruments to 232.6-km altitude to determine amounts of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide in the comet. The flight was “highly successful,” Dr. Stephen P. Maran, gsfc Manager of Operation Kohoutek, said. The comet, discovered 5 May 1973 by Czechoslovak astronomer Dr. Lubos Kohoutek, was once predicted to be the “comet of the century” as it passed near the earth on its 75 000-yr journey around the sun. It was only twice as bright as nearby stars but reflected enough light to permit instruments to be aimed at it precisely.

The House of Representatives passed the special energy research and development appropriations bill, H.R. 14434, by a vote of 392 to 4. The bill appropriated funds to various agencies, including $8.9 million to NASA, for energy r&d in FY 1975. Of the NASA total, $4.5 million would be to implement the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act if enacted. An amendment to appropriate an additional $1 million to NASA was defeated by voice vote. (CR, 30 April 74, H3350-84)
The nasa Space Shuttle Cost and Review Committee recommended program changes to Dr. James C. Fletcher, Administrator, to reduce rising costs. It also reported design changes made necessary by thermal weight constraints. The committee, headed by nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight John F. Yardley, recommended delaying the second shuttle orbiter flight, refurbishing the first test orbiter earlier than planned instead. Deferrals of three months to two years were recommended for components of the second shuttle launch complex at Kennedy Space Center, which had originally been scheduled for completion about the time of the first shuttle flights. Also recommended was a delay in the development of improved spacesuits and portable life support systems for extravehicular activities from the space shuttle. Instead, evas would use Apollo-style hardware. Emergency barriers on shuttle runways and a building at Ksc for installing fairings and parachutes on solid-fueled rocket motors were judged unnecessary. Some tests were recommended for cancellation. Design changes to accommodate thermal and weight constraints included payload doors of a graphite epoxy composite that expanded less when heated and weighed 400 kg less than die aluminum composite originally planned for use. Solid-fueled-rocket separation motors that would provide a higher thrust level for a shorter time when separating die large solid-propellant boosters from the orhiter after launch were found to cause no orbiter damage—solving a possible problem anticipated with the original separation motors. The committee also recommended switching to a new thermal coating material for the external liquid-hydrogen and liquid-oxygen tank to prevent tank overheating during launch, (nasa prog off, interview, 22 Sept 75; Av Wk, 9 Sept 74, 9-10; NASA Off of Admin, Daily Appointments Calendar)
The economy of Florida’s Brevard County was recovering from the impact of Kennedy Space Center layoffs that had followed the end of NASA’s Apollo and Skylab programs, the Washington Post reported. Employment at the launch facilities had formed the basis for Brevard County’s economy and when manpower at ksc was cut in half “the bottom dropped out.” Construction came to a near halt, small businesses closed, and personal bankruptcies soared. By March 1971 the Federal Housing Administration held title to 986 repossessed Brevard County homes and the total tripled in the next three years. However, an advertising campaign, begun in 1971 to attract retired persons to the area and its vacant bargain real estate, started an upswing in the economy. Also contributing to the upswing were a pledge that NASA would not let its ksc manpower fall below the current 9500-employee (Civil Service and contractor) level, assurances that the Air Force would maintain its 13 300-man work force at Eastern Test Range for the next five years, construction of a new regional shopping center, and the advent of Disney World 95 km away.

Ames Research Center’s C-141 airo (Airborne Infrared Observatory) aircraft was officially transferred to operational status for research development. A total of 26 research programs had been approved for C—141 participation, using its 91-cm ir telescope—18 from universities, 5 from NASA or other Government agencies, and 3 from foreign countries. airo also was to participate in studies of Comet Kohoutek.

Research into automotive propulsion systems was reviewed by NASA, Dept, of Transportation, and Environmental Protection Agency officials in hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. H.R. 10392 had been introduced 19 Sept. 1973 to authorize nasa research toward development of economical, energy-conserving systems with clean emissions and improved performance. Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator, testified 4 Feb. that Lewis Research Center was testing epa’s experimental engine, under a June 1973 agreement with epa on work toward a low-pollution gas-turbine-powered vehicle. Upgraded engine work would be completed by mid-1975 and vehicle performance evaluation before the end of CY 1975. First results of Jet Propulsion Laboratory investigations of hydrogen injection into fuel to improve efficiency and reduce pollution in conventional automobile engines promised achievement of 1977 Federal emission standards with 25% improvement in fuel economy. LeRC Director Bruce T. Lundin testified that, in addition to the gas turbine engine, a broader, longer range, advanced technology program was under way, with 13 industry contracts for such improvements as a low-emission combustor, higher-temperature heat exchangers, lower-cost turbine discs, turbine wheel cooling, and low-cost fuel controls. Dr. William H. Pickering, Jpl Director, reported a test automobile using bottled gas to inject hydrogen into the fuel had already met the carbon monoxide emission standard and had almost met the nitrogen oxide standard, although the hydrocarbon emissions remained a problem. With engine modifications to produce hydrogen from gasoline, instead of using bottled gas, performance per gallon of fuel was expected to improve 25% over the conventional engine. (Transcript) 4- 8 February: The first meeting of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization’s Assembly of Parties was held in Washington, D.C. Seventy-two of the eighty-four member governments were represented. Raymond J. Waldmann (U.S.) was elected Chairman and Dr. Osama Anani (Jordan) was elected Deputy Chairman. Elected as Vice-chairmen were Ambassador Alejandro Orfila (Argentina), Ambassador Adolfo Alessandrini (Italy), Ambassador Leonard 0. Kibinge (Kenya), and Ambassador Motoo Ogiso (Japan). The Assembly of Parties found that the proposed U.S. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (goes) and maritime satellite system would not interfere with the intelsat system, goes was technically compatible with the use of the radio-frequency spectrum and orbital space by the existing or planned satellites. The maritime satellite system would not prejudice direct satellite telecommunication links. The Assembly refused a United Nations request for free use of INTELSAT satellites, although a priority access arrangement, for periods not exceeding 90 days during an emergency, would be worked out. (intelsat Release 74-12). 5- 22 February: Mariner 10, launched 3 Nov. 1973, passed within 5800 km of Venus—within 15 km of the planned aim point—at 1:01 pm edt 5 Feb. The encounter sequence was accomplished according to plan and data were transmitted over the 45 million km between the earth and Venus at a rate of 117.6 kilobits per sec. Excellent ultraviolet cloud-structure pictures and new data on particle environment and mass, density, and shape of the planet were returned. Because Mariner 10 approached Venus on the dark side, the TV sequence was not begun until shortly before the encounter, at 12:21 pm edt. The spacecraft flew behind Venus at 1:07 pm edt for 20 min; TV signals were stored on tape and recovered without difficulty after Mariner 10 emerged from the occultation zone. During occultation, the spacecraft’s radio antenna was aimed toward the edge of the planet so that the radio signals were bent around Venus by the extremely dense atmosphere and sent on to the earth. All science instruments functioned normally except the scanning electrostatic analyzer. The TV sequence was completed 13 Feb. after some 4165 pictures were returned to the earth. During the flyby, the 503-kg spacecraft used the gravitational field of Venus to slow its speed and direct the flight path toward a 29 March encounter with Mercury. By 22 Feb. Mariner 10—its speed increasing as it came nearer the sun—was traveling 3 million km per day toward the planet. Preliminary science results were presented at a press briefing 7 Feb. at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr. Herbert S. Bridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, said the solar wind was interacting with the ionosphere of Venus, producing a magnetic tail that could be detected as a modified plasma flow as far out from the planet as 500 Venus radii. Dr. James A. Dunne, Mariner project scientist, said the magnetic field doubled just before radio occultation but that no evidence of an intrinsic planetary magnetic field was found. Preliminary radio science results indicated that Venus was very round, 100 times less oblate than the earth, and confirmed that Venus had a dayside ionosphere. The mass of the planet was slightly less than that derived from previous data. Hydrogen was a major element of the Venus cloud deck, possibly present in droplets of sulfuric acid as well as water vapor. Manner 10 found no evidence of deuterium on the planet, indicating that the hydrogen had originated from the solar wind. Helium, carbon, and atomic oxygen were found in the atmosphere, with possible traces of argon and neon. Outer atmosphere temperature of 590 K (600°F) was suggested. TV data indicated a uniform main cloud deck with three or four layers and a stratified haze layer. TV pictures in uv showed a classical “Y” feature that originated in the equatorial region and spiraled toward the pole. Clear circulation patterns could be seen at the poles, caused by rising gas transporting excess solar heat from the equatorial zone by convection. The atmosphere was smooth, with no swirling storms, (nasa mor, 11 March 74; Briefing transcript; Sullivan, NYT, 5 Feb. 74, 18; 6 Feb. 74, 1; Miles, LA Times, 6 Feb 74)
Ames Research Center scientists had found more evidence that life on primitive earth might have been triggered by chemical evolution of nonliving matter, NASA announced. Seventeen varieties of fatty acids, similar to those used by plants and animals to produce more complex biological molecules, had been discovered in two meteorites. The family of simple carbon-hydrogen acid molecules found in the meteorites had counterparts in biologically formed earth materials, but had not been found in nonorganic sources before, (nasa Release 74-16)
DeElroy E. Beeler, Flight Research Center Director for Center Development, left NASA to join private industry after 28 yrs of service. Beeler had joined the National' Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1941, specializing in high-speed aeronautics. He was appointed project engineer for the X—1, the world’s first aircraft to reach supersonic speeds, and transferred in 1946 to what was to become FRC. There he was instrumental in research planning, design, and flight investigations of advanced research aircraft projects through X-15 and XB-70. In 1954 Beeler was named frc’s first Director of Research and in 1958 he became Deputy Director, a position he held until 1973. (frc X—Press, 27 Sept 74, 2; nasa biog, 25 July 63)
Edwin C. Kilgore, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Center Operations, had been named Director for Management Operations, Langley Research Center, effective 1 March 1975, NASA announced. Kilgore would assume the functions of LaRC Director for Administration Raymond G. Romatowski and most of the functions of Director for Center Development and External Affairs T. Melvin Butler. While at NASA Hq., Kilgore had served as Acting Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology and also as Deputy Associate Administrator (Management) in the same office. In 1973 Kilgore had been awarded NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal for developing an improved system for managing advanced technology programs. Romatowski had accepted the position at NASA Hq. of Assistant Administrator for Personnel Programs. Butler would retire in December. (nasa Release 74-324A)

Data from Pioneer 10 taken during its 3 Dec. 1973 encounter with Jupiter had indicated that the upper atmosphere of the planet was 400 K (260°F), about 480 K (520° F) hotter than previously calculated. Dr. Arvydas J. Kliore, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist, said at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Temperatures deeper down in the atmosphere rose to as much as 700 K (800°F), the highest temperature found so far on any planet in the solar system. The findings suggested that the surface temperature could reach 5800 K (10 000°F), the surface temperature of the sun. The surprising heat might be explained by heavy dust layers in the upper levels of the atmosphere that absorbed solar radiation or absorbed heat radiating away from the surface of the planet. • Dr. Fred L. Whipple, retired Director of the Smithsonian Astro-physical Observatory, said that methyl cyanide and hydrogen cyanide, two compounds always identified with interstellar dust, had been found in abundance in Comet Kohoutek. The discovery marked the first time the chemicals had been identified with a comet and the first time they had been seen in space inside the solar system. “It . . . increases the suspicion that comets were formed . . . out at about 30 trillion km or halfway to the nearest star.” {W Post, 5 April 74, A29; 7 April 74, A3)
The first few space shuttle flights would land at Flight Research Center, Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, announced in a talk before the Antelope Valley Board of Trade, Lancaster, Calif. First horizontal test flights would be made from FRC and first orbital test flights would return there because of added safety margins and good weather conditions. FRC would also he a secondary landing site for operational shuttle flights when weather or other conditions made it desirable. (nasa Release 74-279)
NASA authorized two flight kits for Apollo-Soyuz astronauts: an official flight kit, containing selective items for memorabilia, and an astronaut preference kit, containing 20 personal items selected individually. Special flight items having particular significance for the mission would be suggested by the Director, Johnson Space Center, and approved by the Administrator. (NASA nmi 8020.19B)
A New York Times editorial commented on the Atomic Energy Commission report The Nation’s Energy Future, submitted December 1973 to President Nixon: The report, which was the basis for Administration policy, would allocate more than half the proposed energy research and development budget to nuclear projects. More than 25% of nuclear funds would be spent on the fast-breeder reactor. Three critical questions were in need of answers: risk of accident, security against theft, and the relative merit of alternative forms of energy. An AEC environmental impact statement issued in response to a court order in a 1971 suit by a group of scientists failed, the Times said, to weigh objectively the possible alternatives that might be environmentally less damaging, particularly solar energy. “But in making the choice between nuclear fission and solar energy, Congress and the public have to weigh the alternatives carefully. The a.e.c. can contribute to that decision by offering the nation a more careful and disinterested impact statement.” (NYT, 23 May 74, 38) r
George Cunningham, paralyzed from the neck down in a high school football game, was the first quadriplegic to use a device developed for astronauts disabled in space, the Baltimore Sun reported. He could place a telephone call, control a radio or TV, open the curtains in his hospital room, or call the nurses’ station by blowing into a tube. The device, Nu-Life, made up of two tiny video display screens and a miniature computer, was operated by inhaling and exhaling into a plastic tube or controlled by eye rotation, a turn of the head, or a touch of the tongue. (AP, B Sun, 21 March 74, A3) 23 March-5 April: NASA’s Mariner 10, launched 3 Nov. 1973, became the first spacecraft to explore Mercury, during a 12-day flyby of the planet— returning some 1700 TV photos and much new information on its atmosphere, surface, mass, and shape. The incoming encounter sequence began 23 March at 5 600 000 km from Mercury, transmitting the clearest photos yet taken of the tiny planet. Although most of the photos were recorded on tape before transmission, real-time photos with reduced resolution were sent to analyze the reflective properties of Mercury at different lighting angles. By 28 March photos were showing the-planet to he heavily cratered like the moon. During the incoming near-encounter, from 17 to 3% hrs before encounter, 18 frames were transmitted. Mosaics were made for locating smaller areas photographed later at higher resolutions. Spacecraft instruments identified an extremely thin atmosphere surrounding the planet, containing helium at concentrations above lunar levels and small amounts of neon, argon, and possibly zenon. Mariner 10 passed within 704 km of Mercury at 4:47 pm edt 29 March, within 56 km of the aim point. Data were transmitted without interruption over the 150 000 000-km distance until earth occultation began at 4:50 pm edt. Radio signals were recovered following the 12min occultation. Photos of the planet—described by scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory as “superb”—showed details less than 1.6 km in size and covered almost half the planet’s surface, which was pocked with craters as deep as 32 km and between 8 and 160 km wide. Giant cracks in the surface suggested high heat beneath. Some ancient volcanic activity was seen in a few rille-like ravines that crossed the craters and domelike hills. Absence of halo craters indicated young craters probably had been covered by the dust storms that constantly swept the planet. At a jpl press briefing following the encounter, Dr. James C. Fletcher said onboard instruments showed that Mercury had an unexpected magnetic field, estimated to be 1 % that of the earth. The magnetic field was measured at 90 to 100 gammas at the spacecraft’s closest approach, with an extrapolated value at the surface of 100 to 200 gammas. As Mariner 10 raced by Mercury on 30 March, photos of the morning side of the planet showed a much smoother region than the rugged area seen under the afternoon sun. The north pole region appeared much less pitted and flatter than the south pole. Instruments found that Mercury was two-thirds iron, making its density greater than previously believed and probably responsible for the unexpected magnetic field. Concentrations of uranium and thorium were comparable to those on the earth. Preliminary results, presented at a 31 March press conference at jpl, included a Mercury mass measurement 100 times better than previous ones, a detached well-defined bow shock wave, a temperature varying from 90 K on the night side to 700 K on the day side (— 300°F to 800°F) with no thermal anomalies detected, opaque surface soil with the top few centimeters 1.0 to 1.5 times as dense as water and 50% as porous, and high-energy electrons in the mev range observed from 700 to 5000 km above the surface. An ultraviolet scanner had detected what appeared to be an egg-shaped moon moving in orbit around Mercury, but the Mariner navigational team later identified the object as a dim but very hot star, known as 31 Crater in the constellation Corvus. Despite a power anomaly, Mariner 10 continued to transmit TV pictures in real-time at 117.6 kilobits per sec and tape-recorded frames at 22.05 kbps. TV imagery was discontinued 5 April when the resolution became equal to that of earth-based telescopes. All mission events were accomplished as planned and the mission was adjudged successful 22 April. The spacecraft was expected to swing back by Mercury in September, (nasa mor, 24 April 74; jpl Press Kit, 19 March 74; NYT, 24 March 74, 30 March—1 April.74; W Post, 29 March—1 April 74; W Star-News, 28 March 74; LA Times, 20 March-1 April 74)
The economic return from the U.S. space program amounted to 33% per year, exceeding the typical yield from investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate, Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., Johnson Space Center Director, said in a speech at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. at Blacksburg, Va. Among returns not immediately visible to the public were some 30000 inventions available by the end of the Apollo program. The price of Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite—surveying the earth since its launch 23 July 1972—was less than 50 cents per American. “Given its potential for aiding us in the coming years, who would not support a program that costs less than a . . . half-pound [one fourth kilogram] of ground beef?” Dr. Kraft estimated that the space shuttle, at an annual cost of $5 for each American, was an investment that would “pay, perhaps, the greatest return to future generations.” With such a vehicle we could not only perform a variety of scientific studies with immediate application to life on earth but build permanent, space stations and launch planetary vehicles and eventually starships. The space shuttle program, with its international cooperation, would unite “many nations for the benefit of all.” (Text)
NASA’s report on emergency preparedness and defense mobilization activities for FY 1973 was issued £y the Senate in the 23rd annual report of activities of the Joint Committee on Defense Production. NASA had revised emergency plans at field installations for increased readiness for a broader range of emergencies. The agency’s contract policies had contributed to maintenance of a broad industrial base of small businesses to meet conditions of a national emergency. Research and development programs contributing to energy solutions included studies of new aeronautical technology, solar and wind energy, clean fuel production, improved use of coal, and more efficient fuels. Technology utilization teams were applying aerospace technology to public problems in medicine, urban construction, law enforcement, mine safety, air and water pollution, and transportation.

Static test firings of a 6.4%-scale model of the space shuttle to gather acoustical data for design and development activities began at Marshall Space Flight Center. A series of 24 acoustic test firings would continue through November, with 7 additional tests later to study possible sound-suppression methods. The test model’s two solid-propellant engines, representing the shuttle vehicle’s solid-fueled-rocket boosters, were being tested first, to be followed by full system firings, including the three model liquid-propellant engines representing the main engines, which would use liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. On each firing, 60 acoustic measurements were taken by specialized microphones to monitor areas potentially sensitive to high sound-pressure levels: vehicle skin panels, thermal protection devices, electronic guidance components, and ground support and related structures, (msfc Release 74-154; msfc pio, interview, 15 July 75)
A new artificial limb had been developed by Kennedy Space Center and Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in California, icsc announced. The strapless device was attached directly to the amputee’s bone through a carbon collar that remained at skin level. Originally developed for rocket motors, the high-purity carbon material would not cause infection in patients. Previously, the body’s rejection of foreign materials and the failure of the skin to form a hygienic seal had prevented direct attachment to the bone. A quick-release ball connector for the limb was based on a device that held rocket umbilical attachments in place until liftoff, (ksc Release 134-74)
Johnson Space Center had awarded a $2 104 900 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to Westinghouse Electric Corp. to refurbish and modify 10 color TV cameras from the Skylab program, for use in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Westinghouse would also provide two new cameras and equipment. (jsc Release 74-101)
Three Kitt Peak National Observatory astronomers announced they had photographed large-scale structures, hot and cold regions, that were probably convection currents in the atmosphere of Alpha Orionis (the star Betelguese in the Constellation Orion), 500 light years from the earth. The announcement, made in Florida at the American Astronomical Society’s annual meeting, was based on photos made 28 March using the four-meter Mayall Telescope. A new technique of interferometry analysis had permitted reconstruction of the star’s image. In resolving the disc of Betelguese, the Kitt Peak astronomers became the first observers to distinguish actual forms on a star other than the sun. (nsf Release 74-229)
The Air Force awarded a $42.8-million fixed-price-incentive firmaward-fee contract to Rockwell International Corp. to design, develop, fabricate, launch, and operate three prototype satellites in the navstar Global Positioning System. Included in the contract were associated hardware, qualification model, and computer programming and services. In addition, two navigation subsystems would be delivered for use aboard a NAVSTAR satellite to be developed by the Naval Research Laboratory. When completed, the 24 satellites in the NAVSTAR system would provide worldwide precise positioning and navigation, day or night, and under all weather conditions, (dod Release 268-74)
Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center since its establishment in 1962, announced his retirement. Born in Germany, Dr. Debus had begun his career in U.S. military and NASA space programs in 1945, when with Dr. Wernher von Braun he had joined the Army’s ballistic missile program. He had supervised the launch of the first Redstone ballistic missile in 1953 and the flight-testing of Jupiter and Pershing missiles and Jupiter C and Juno launch vehicles until the Army team was transferred to NASA in 1960. He had directed the launch of the first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, on 31 Jan. 1958, and NASA launch programs from the flight of Alan B. Shepard, Jr., in 1961 to preparations for space shuttle operations. Dr. Debus had received the Louis W. Hill Space Transportation Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics as well as the Army’s highest civilian decoration, the Exceptional Civilian Service Medal, and NASA’s Distinguished Service Medal.

Marshall Space Flight Center had negotiated a restructured contract with TRW Inc. for the first of three High Energy Astronomy Observatory spacecraft to be launched between 1977 and 1979, NASA announced. Modifications had increased the original contract value by $9 451139, to a new total of $86 397 579. The contract covered design, development, manufacture, test, checkout, and delivery of the spacecraft. Period of performance was from 1 July 1974 through 15 April 1980. The original heao program, approved in 1971 and suspended in 1973 because of budget cuts, had called for two large unmanned observatories. The new contract called for a series of smaller scale missions using three satellites in circular orbits at an altitude of 416 km to obtain data on high-energy radiation from space—celestial x-rays, gamma-rays, and cosmic rays. Contracts totaling $23 332 700 had also been signed for five experiments to be carried by the second spacecraft, heao-b. The awards included $1 350 000 to American Science and Engineering, Inc., to design and build the x-ray telescope, (nasa Release 74-240; m§fc Release 74179)
Wind-tunnel tests of almost all supersonic portions of a typical NASA space shuttle flight were completed at Arnold Engineering Development Center. The simulated flight profile included separation of the orbiter and its fuel tank from the two large solid-fueled rocket motors, orbiter flight with and without fuel tank, and orbiter reentry into the earth’s atmosphere. The tests, begun September 1973, showed orbiter flight characteristics and the heat levels segments of the system could be expected to experience while traveling 4% to 20 times the speed of sound, (afsc Newsreview, June 74, 8-9; aedc proj off, interview, 27 March 75) 6-7, 12-13 March: nasa Acting Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology Edwin C. Kilgore and other NASA officials testified on the FY 1975 nasa oast budget in hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology. Kilgore testified 6 March that in FY 1975 oast would modify its “program again to meet the changing needs of the Nation.” Energy conservation “is an inherent part of our aeronautics and space research and I believe we have the capability also to provide significant support to civil needs for energy technology. At the same time, we must continue our effective response to the Nation’s need for a quiet, clean, economical air transportation system, for support to military aviation, and for a viable program to exploit and explore space.” Much of the aeronautics program [see 26 Feb.] already was “contributing to aircraft fuel conservation.” Advanced avionics systems to relieve terminal congestion, more highly maneuverable aircraft and operational procedures, more efficient engines, composite materials for weight reduction, and aerodynamic drag reduction techniques—“all contribute to fuel economy.” And the program was being examined to increase emphasis in areas related to the national energy problem, both in conservation and in long-term technology. For space exploration, propellants with more powerful liquified-gas oxidizers—storable in cold space conditions—offered up to 30% increase in payloads over those permitted by earth-storable propellants. Nuclear energy studies included investigation of low-temperature thermionic converters, gaseous uranium reactor concepts, and use of heat from high-temperature reactor sources for industry use. In stationary power, NASA was working with the Dept, of Interior’s Office of Coal Research to increase power produced from coal 40%. [See also During March.] George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs, oast, said 12 March that research and development on shuttle systems had contributed to substantial improvements in both high- and low-temperature reusable insulations, coatings, bearings, seals, and hydraulic fluids, all applicable on the earth. The requirement that a reusable space tug return to the shuttle for return to the earth had doubled the velocity requirement of the vehicle, speeding the development of a high-performance propulsion system.

NASA announced two Kennedy Space Center contract awards for space shuttle facilities. Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc., had been given a $21 812 737 contract to construct a space shuttle runway with overruns, apron, taxiway, and access roads. The runway—to be completed within 850 days after the notice to proceed—was to be built northwest of the Vehicle Assembly Building. Reynolds, Smith, and Hills received a $1 463 000 fixed-price contract to design modifications to Launch Complex 39 and Mobile Launcher 3 for shuttle operations. Complex 39, Apollo and Skylab launch site, would next be used for a manned flight in 1975, for the U.S.—U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. (NASA Releases 74-66, 74-67)
Effects of the shapes of trucks on air drag and fuel consumption were being studied by NASA and the Department of Transportation, NASA announced. Trucks traveling 80 km per hr used more than half their engine horsepower to overcome drag. Preliminary tests had shown that a rectangular vehicle with rounded corners had 30% less air drag at 90 to 95 km per hr and used 15% less fuel. Other configurations would be tested at Flight Research Center and dot’s Transportation Systems Center using technology and instrumentation developed in FRCs aeronautics flight-test program, (nasa Release 74-152)
Johnson Space Center had issued requests to 11 interested aerospace companies to submit contract proposals for computing and data processing for space program software systems, JSC announced. Primary objective of the contract would be to define, design, .develop, and maintain software systems (for space shuttle, earth resources, and other science programs) that had maximum flexibility for supporting a wide variety of missions and future requirements. The cost-plus-award-fee contract would run from 1 July 1974 through 31 Dec. 1979. (JSC Release 74-30)
Industrial research and development spending had totaled $19.4 billion in 1972, an increase of 6% over 1971, National Science Foundation report Research and Development in Industry 1972 (nsf 74-312) revealed. Company r&d funds had increased 7% and Federal R&D support registered a 6% gain after three years of decreases. The full-time-equivalent number of R&D scientists in industry had increased to nearly 360 000 between January 1971 and January 1972, the first increase since January 1969, when the total was 386 000. Dept, of Defense and NASA had provided 87% of the Federal r&d funds to industry in 1972 and supported 88% of the industrial R&D scientists and engineers working on Federal programs.

The success of Skylab’s Apollo Telescope Mount solar experiment was more than a milestone in space exploration, Dr. John Eddy, solar physicist of the Boulder, Colo., High Altitude Observatory, said in a New Scientist article. This battery of the world’s most advanced telescopes lofted to the ideal observation site had clarified previous theoretical sketches of the vertical extent of the sun’s chromospheric structures. Spicules, which outlined the giant circulation cells of the chromosphere and extended through the transition region, disappeared at temperatures of 1 million K in the low corona, suggesting that the magnetic field lines diverged in the corona. First results from the atm x-ray observations destroyed the common concept of a homogeneous background corona, which had served as a basis of modern coronal physics, and revealed that the corona was composed almost entirely of closed loop structures fitting magnetic field lines calculated from observed photospheric fields. Reasons for the ATM success included the large-scale and highly sophisticated instruments, large data-storage capability, efficiency of instrument operation, operation of the six instruments in concert, extensive ground support, and astronaut interest and training. Program results would be shared by scientists in many countries and the program appeared a good investment, in scientific yield per dollar spent. (New Scientist, 21 March 74, 738-741)
Aerospace companies that had succeeded in using the system approach to develop advanced technology for use in space were encountering difficulties in the field of urban mass transportation, a New York Times article said. Boeing Co. Aerospace Div. faced losses of up to $6 million on an automated “people mover” shuttle system in Morgantown, W. Va. Cost of the project, chosen four years ago as a pilot application of aerospace management techniques, had jumped from the original estimate of S13.4 million to $115 million. Rohr Industries, Inc., had lost more than $10 million on a project to build 450 commuter cars for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit System, which had threatened to sue Rohr over late deliveries and alleged unreliability of some cars. Observers had noted that aerospace technologists tended to “overengineer” transit systems, increasing costs, aggravating maintenance, and marring reliability. In addition there were problems in converting prototypes to hardware that could withstand the rigors of carrying throngs of people. But, despite the frustrations, more companies were entering the competition. A significant test of how the aerospace industry would fare in the next era of transit development would be the performance of Boeing’s Vertol Div. in two projects to produce 230 streetcars for Boston and San Francisco and 100 cars for Chicago’s rapid transit system. (Lindsey, AFT1,21 April 74, 3:1) Dr. Alastair G. W. Cameron, Harvard College Observatory scientist, said that an enormous spherical cloud of comets with a combined mass 20 times that of Jupiter might lie beyond the planets and form a far more massive part of the universe than the planets. This cloud, the Oort cloud, might be a repository for heavy elements formed since the infancy of the Milky Way. Dr. R. W. Klebesadel of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory said that satellites, placed in a 100 000-km orbit as part of the Air Force Vela series developed to monitor the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has monitored 27 high-intensity explosions in space over four years. The explosions, which had produced unusually large amounts of gamma and x-ray energy, might be in the Orion arm of the galaxy, where the earth was. Dr. Philip Morrison of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said nine current theories of the origin of the explosions included exploding stars, or supernovas; objects falling into neutron stars; and unusually large solar flares or sunstorms on distant stars.

The first phase of the Pioneer direct-mode command system, which would permit Ames Research Center to control its spacecraft directly, became operational. The Pioneer command (pcom) system would permit direct control without depending on Jet Propulsion Laboratory computer systems. Committed operational use of pcom would begin on Pioneer 10 (launched 2 March 1972) on 1 Sept., followed by Pioneer 11 (launched 5 April 1973) on 15 Jan. 1975. (arc Astrogram, 6 June 74,1)
A robot with an artificial intelligence for making independent decisions in environments hostile to man was being developed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology to prove the feasibility of using robots for planetary exploration. The planned rover would be equipped with metal arms and hands, a visual system of two TV cameras and a laser, wheels for legs, and thousands of instructions programmed into its computer brain. It would be able to analyze a scene, extract information from it, make some choices, and move around obstacles, (nasa Release 74-260)
A new method using tiny electronic body sensors, developed by Ames Research Center for remotely recording physical responses during space flight training and research programs, was being used to measure the precise walking patterns of children with cerebral palsy, NASA announced. Patients could be free of cumbersome equipment that had hindered obtaining accurate gait measurements. (NASA Release 74-131) 17—24 May: Sms 1 (sms-a Synchronous Meteorological Satellite)—first meteorological satellite in synchronous orbit—was launched by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from Eastern Test Range at 5:31 am edt. The lst-stage propulsion of the three-stage Thor-Delta launch vehicle was less than normal. The 2nd stage burned to near propellant completion, compensating for the deficiency but leaving insufficient propellant to complete the planned second burn. The spacecraft entered a lower-than-planned transfer orbit with a 32 895km apogee, 180-km perigee, 9-hr 37-min period, and 24.5° inclination. The apogee boost motor boosted the spacecraft into a near-geostationary orbit with a 32 828.3-km apogee, 30 747-km perigee, 20-hr 39-min period, and 2.0° inclination, with an eastward drift of approximately 56° per day. The auxiliary propulsion system was fired at 3:00 am EDT 19 May to place the spacecraft in operational attitude. A planned series of aps firings between 19 and 24 May increased the orbit to geosynchronous altitude, eliminated orbital drift, and stopped the satellite at 45° west longitude. An early post-launch review of flight data revealed no spacecraft anomalies, and the first photos were transmitted 24 May. NASA objectives—to launch the spacecraft into a geosynchronous orbit of sufficient accuracy to accomplish operational mission requirements and evaluate and check out the spacecraft—were met and the mission was adjudged successful 17 Dec. Operational control was turned over to NOAA10 Dec. after checkout. The 272-kg satellite (628 kg at launch) would, for the first time, provide continuous day and night images of cloud cover over the U.S. and Atlantic Ocean. Its data-collection systems would be key elements in the Global Atmospheric Research Program’s Atlantic Tropical Experiment to be conducted during the summer, collecting meteorological, hydrological, oceanographic, seismic, and tsunami data. In addition, Sms 1 would monitor solar flare activity for future manned spacecraft and supersonic aircraft flights. Sms 1 was the first in a series which would include two operational prototypes and one operational spacecraft (sms-c, to become Goes 1 on launch), developed and funded by NASA to meet the requirements of the Dept, of Commerce for its Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (goes) system. The sms project was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under the direction of the Office of Applications. GSFC also had responsibility for the Thor-Delta launch vehicle.

A General Accounting Office report disclosed by Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton (D-Mo.) had questioned Pentagon plans to begin production of 34 radar-carrying aircraft, part of the Airborne Warning and Control System, the Washington Post reported. The GAO report said the radar planes’ mission, defense against bomber attack, had changed and the project should be delayed until it was certain the system would work in its new role. There had been no demonstration that the aircraft could work effectively in a massive air battle. In addition, GAO questioned whether the aircraft’s large radar would be susceptible to enemy jamming from distances as great as 320 km and whether the planes would become high-priority targets. Sen. Eagleton therefore had requested the Senate Armed Services Committee to deny aw ACS production in 1974. (Getler, W Post, 11 March 74, A2) 11, 21 March: Joint hearings on the Technology Resources Survey and Applications Act, S. 2495, were held by the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and the Committee on Commerce. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said NASA supported the broad objectives of the bill, which would amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to establish within NASA an Office of Technology Applications to support the proposed National Resources Council. However, NASA already had an effective technology utilization program and did not require additional authority to ensure that its technological capabilities were effectively used. Dr. Fletcher said he could give more support to the bill if the responsibility for a proposed survey of technological resources were given to the existing Domestic Council. Dr. H. Guyford Stever, National Science Foundation Director, said technology coordination and planning analysis could be more effectively done by an augmented Federal Council for Science and Technology than by the proposed Council. In addition, although NASA had great technological resources, it was essential that mission agencies should be held to their originally defined responsibility. Dr. Philip Handler, President of the National Academy of Sciences, said the bill unduly emphasized technological resources of NASA and the aerospace industry, when the real issue was how to use the entire Federal science and technology effort in combination with private industry resources within coherent national programs and plans. Instead of direct authorization to NASA, a similar amount should be made available to the President or a council, such as the Council of Economic Advisors or the Council on Environmental Quality, to allocate and coordinate. Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., President of the National Academy of Engineering and former NASA Deputy Administrator, favored a compact organizational structure with leadership appointed by the President and a research staff independent of all agencies and industry. NASA-developed technology could be used with that in other agencies and private industry. NASA laboratories should be used whenever appropriate. Employees and facilities of Lewis Research Center, which was preeminent in the fields of air-breathing and space-propulsion systems, could be applied effectively to energy research and development.

A full-scale simulated crash of an aircraft with a crew of four lifelike dummies was successfully completed at Langley Research Center as part of five years of tests in a program to study the crash-worthiness of light, general-aviation aircraft. The aircraft, a surplus twin-engine Piper Navajo, was suspended from the top of the test facility and swung by cables into the ground at 97 km per hr. An umbilical cable fed data on structural response back to a computer. The program was a cooperative effort with the Federal Aviation Administration and private industry to develop structural design techniques to improve the capability of light aircraft to withstand crash conditions and to increase the likelihood of passenger survival, (nasa Release 74—107; Newport News, Va., Times Herald, 9 May 74)

Two scientists had predicted that in 1982 a rare alignment of all nine planets on the same side of the sun would produce major earthquakes, Newsweek reported. In their book The Jupiter Effect, John Cribbin of the British magazine Nature and Stephen Plagemann of Goddard Space Flight Center warned that increased solar activity caused by the alignment, which occurred every 179 yrs, would alter wind directions in the upper atmosphere. The frictional effect exerted on the solid earth by atmospheric circulation would change with the winds. The consequent braking of the earth’s rotation rate would trigger earthquakes in areas, like California, under geological stress. (Newsweek, 16 Sept 74, 57)

The contract called for 124, TX—354-5 (Castro II) rocket motors, 41 upper-burn nozzle closure plugs, and documentation for the Thor-Delta, which was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center. The Castro II strap-ons had a thrust of about 270 000 newtons (60 000 lbs). (NASA Release 74-219)
NASA announced selection of Boeing Aerospace Co., Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., and Martin Marietta Corp. for negotiation of parallel contracts of about $300 000 each for preliminary design and program definition studies for the support systems module (ssm), a major element of the Large Space Telescope (lst) . The lst was scheduled for launch into orbit on the space shuttle in the 1980s. The ssm, attached to the structure housing the telescope, would provide electric power, data storage, communications, and automated attitude sensing, pointing, and control. The unit would also contain some of the elements for orbital servicing and retrieval of the telescope by the space shuttle, (nasa Release 74-308)
Japan successfully launched Tansei 2 experimental MS-T2 satellite from Kagoshima Space Center, Uchinoura, on a three-stage MU—3C booster at 2:00 pm local time (1:00 am edt) after a two-day postponement because of bad weather. A thrust-vector-control system had been installed on the 2nd stage of the booster to stabilize its flight. The improved version of the four-stage MU-4S was the first guided booster Japan had used. The satellite entered orbit with a 3229-km apogee, 283-km perigee, 121.7-min period, and 31.2° inclination, kyodo news service reported the objective was “to test the control devices and not for scientific observation.” Tansei 2, named “Light Blue” for the Univ. of Tokyo colors, was Japan’s fifth satellite and third test satellite. Ohsumi (launched 11 Feb. 1970) and Tansei 1 (launched 16 Feb. 1971) were test satellites returning performance data. Shinsei (launched 28 Sept. 1971) had carried instruments to study cosmic rays and electric waves, and Denpa (Radio Explorer Satellite launched 19 Aug. 1972) had carried instruments to probe the ionosphere, (gsfc SSR, 28 Feb 74; FBis-Japan, 22 Feb 74, 13-14; A&A 1971) The Italian-built 170-kg San Marco 4 carried three experiments: an Italian density-drag accelerometer to measure atmospheric drag, a U.S. omegatyon to measure the temperature and density of thermosphere molecular nitrogen, and a U.S. neutral mass spectrometer to measure primary constituents of the neutral atmosphere. Data gathered by San Marco 4 in the equatorial zone and Explorer 51 in the auroral zone would provide a good picture of the effects of magnetic storms on the thermosphere and differences in the thermosphere’s response to energy coming from the sun to the poles and the equator. The omegatron experiment was activated 19 Feb. and the neutral mass spectrometer 22 Feb. By 26 Feb. both instruments were acquiring worthwhile scientific data. The Italian density-drag accelerometer, activated shortly after launch but not performing properly, was being investigated. All spacecraft systems were functioning as planned. San Marco 4 was the fourth satellite launched under cooperative agreements between NASA and the Italian Space Commission. San Marco 1 was launched 15 Dec. 1964; San Marco 2, 26 April 1967; and San Marco 3, 24 April 1971. Under the latest agreement, signed 6 Aug. 1973, Italy had designed and built the spacecraft, provided one experiment, and conducted launch operations. The U.S. provided the Scout booster, two experiments, technical consultation, launch crew training, and spacecraft tracking and data acquisition, (nasa mors, 15, 26 Feb 74; NASA Releases 74-30,74-39) 18 February—6 March: Thomas L. Gatch ’was lost at sea while attempting the first transatlantic balloon flight. Gatch lifted off from Harrisburg, Pa., 18 Feb. in a two-meter sealed gondola, the Light Heart, suspended from 10 helium-filled balloons. He hoped to reach 12 000-m altitude and ride the jet-stream winds across the Atlantic to Europe, but changes in air currents pushed him south of his planned course. Radio contact was made with Gatch 19 Feb. by an airliner 1600 km east northeast of Puerto Rico. He was spotted at 305-m altitude 21 Feb. by a Liberian ship 1670 km off the coast of Africa. Further inconsistent and unconfirmed radio contacts and sightings made tracking Gatch’s balloon difficult. After reports of a sighting on the Spanish Sahara, the Spanish Foreign Legion searched the 480-km Moroccan-Spanish Sahara border for two days, while U.S. military aircraft and ships were put on lookout. The Dept, of Defense ordered an intensive visual radar and radio search 1 March of the Atlantic Ocean 1530 km west of Africa, but the search was given up 6 March after exploration of 578 000 sq km of ocean.

The House agreed to H. Res. 988, the Committee Reform Amendments of 1974, by a 359-to-7 vote, reorganizing House committee jurisdictions and procedures. The name of the Committee on Science and Astronautics was changed to Committee on Science and Technology effective 3 Jan. 1975, and the Committee’s jurisdiction was broadened to include all research and development in non-nuclear energy, environment, weather, and aviation, with special oversight over all nonmilitary Federal r&d. Legislative responsibility for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would be shared with the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Responsibility for Federal Aviation Administration civil aviation R&D programs would be added to that for NASA’s aeronautical R&D. Major emphasis on the civilian national space program would continue. (CR, 8 Oct 74, D1210-11, H10146-69; 17 Feb 75, 534-5; House Com Staff interview, 24 March 76)
nasa launched three satellites—Noaa 4 (itos-g) meteorological satellite for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Intasat ionospheric satellite for Spain, and Amsat Oscar 7 amateur radio communications satellite—from Western Test Range at 9:11 am pst on one Thor-Delta launch vehicle. The three spacecraft entered almost identical, near-to-planned, polar orbits. It was the first triple launch for a Thor-Delta. Noaa 4 entered orbit with a 1458-km apogee, 1444-km perigee, 115min period, and 101.7° inclination, as the fourth operational Improved Tiros Operational Satellite in the joint NASA and Dept, of Commerce program to provide global cloud-cover observations. Delayed 29 Oct. by faulty electrical connectors on the Thor-Delta and again 13 Nov. when a 2nd-stage hydraulic pump posed a problem, the launch went smoothly on 15 Nov. Noaa 4 joined Noaa 2, launched 15 Oct. 1972, and Noaa 3, launched 6 Nov. 1973. The 345-kg, three-axis-stabilized, earth-oriented satellite moved in a circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. Day and night coverage of the earth’s cloud cover was provided by two very-high-resolution radiometer instruments and by two scanning radiometer sensors. Two vertical-temperature-profile radiometers made continuous radiance measurements for determination of the atmospheric vertical temperature profile over every part of the earth’s surface at least twice daily. One secondary sensor, the solar proton monitor, studied solar activity and its effects on the earth’s environment. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for design, development, launch, and in-orbit checkout of the spacecraft. noaa’s National Environmental Satellite Service (ness) would take over operation of the satellite after checkout. NASA mission objectives—to launch the spacecraft into sun-synchronous orbit of sufficient accuracy for operational mission requirements and to conduct an in-orbit evaluation and checkout of the spacecraft—were accomplished and the mission was adjudged successful 24 Jan. 1976. Intasat, the first Spanish satellite, separated from the Delta 2nd stage 24 min after launch and entered orbit with a 1468-km apogee and perigee, 115-min period, and 101.7° inclination. The 20-kg, 12-sided, magnetically oriented, spin-stabilized spacecraft would measure ionospheric electron content, irregularities, and scintillations in a joint space research program of NASA and the Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial. inta provided the spacecraft and would acquire experiment data. NASA provided pickaback launch and tracking. Amsat Oscar 7—the Radio Amateur Satellite Corp.’s Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio—separated from the Delta 2nd stage 77 min after liftoff and entered orbit with a 1458-km apogee, 1454-km perigee, 115-min period, and 101.7° inclination. The seventh in a series begun with Oscar 1 in 1961, the solar-powered, octahedral, 29.5-kg Oscar 7 joined Oscar 6, launched 15 Oct. 1972, to serve as a space communications relay station for radio amateurs and as a teaching aid, giving firsthand experience in space science for U.S. schools. Oscar 7 was built and prepared for launch by the Radio Amateur Satellite Corp.

The U.S. Army Electronics Command was awarding a $1 689 116 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to Cincinnati Electronics, Inc., to develop, fabricate, and test ultrahigh-frequency satellite-line-of-sight manpack transceiver models, (dod Release 231—74) During May: Preliminary discussions aimed at an eventual global system of second-generation meteorological satellites were held in Geneva, sponsored by the 139-member World Meteorological Organization. Delegates considered establishment of a worldwide forum for presentation of data requirements by users, creation of a mechanism for filing launch plans and distributing advance information on capabilities to potential users of planned satellites, and prospects for training users to interpret and apply data from advanced satellites. Talks were held concurrently on technical standardization of systems, including preliminary standards for ground stations, coordination of transmission times and frequencies, and standardization of automatic-picture-transmission installations. Agreements made at the informal sessions would be taken back to the technical agencies of the various countries and implemented, without the necessity of official review. One result was agreement on L-band frequencies, with U.S. satellites to transmit on 1690 me. Soviet sources revealed that the U.S.S.R.’s first synchronous meteorological satellite would be launched in 1977 or 1978 and placed over the Indian Ocean at 70° E. The press reported that it was expected to be technically compatible with U.S., European Space Research Organization, and Japanese satellites in its class. (Av Wk, 20 May 74, 21) June 1974 Primary mission objective was to investigate the interaction between the solar wind and the earth’s magnetic field. Secondary objectives included locating magnetic neutral points or lines during both quiet and disturbed solar wind conditions and studying magnetic field topology at large radial distances over the polar caps. By 20 June all booms and electric antennas had been extended and the spacecraft had despun to the planned five to six revolutions per minute. The transmitters and all experiments were operating satisfactorily. Hawkeye 1 was the sixth of the Univ. of Iowa’s Injun series, which had begun with the 29 June 1961 launch of Injun 1 and provided a comprehensive study of charged particles trapped in the earth’s magnetosphere.

An Aviation Week <& Space Technology editorial said the FY 1975 aerospace budget request offered the aerospace industry “its best prospect in a decade.” The dollar increases were “significant because they were aimed at alleviating problems caused by a decade of neglect in basic weapon system development and diplomatic euphoria” and recognized that aerospace was an “important sinew of national power and economic strength.” It was the first budget in many years that had no major program cancellations or cuts. The worst cut, $89 million, meant a six-month delay in the first shuttle flight but was accompanied by a written guarantee of future support for full funding of the program. The military budget was well balanced between research, development, and procurement. While the NASA program would not satisfy the space buffs, it was a strong continuing effort supplemented by $500 million in military space activities and the growing communications and applications space activity in other agencies. The aerospace industry must now spend extra effort in delivering the hardware and performance to meet the challenge required by this budget. (Holz, Av Wk, 11 Feb 74,7) # _
NASA had applied for a patent on a special absorptive coating developed by a Marshall Space Flight Center engineer. It would be applied to aluminum panels used in the construction of the solar heating and cooling system being demonstrated at msfc. The coating absorbed 93% of the total solar heat, which was transferred to water circulated through flow passages to a storage tank for use in heating or cooling; it reradiated only 6% of the infrared heat, (nasa Release 74-96)

NASA and the Office of Naval Research launched the world’s largest unmanned balloon from Fort Churchill, Canada, carrying a 363-kg payload to 47 000-m altitude. The experiment, designed hy Goddard Space Flight Center scientist Dr. Robert C. Hartman, measured position and electron spectra between 20 and 800 mev at the 1.2-millibar level. The helium-filled balloon, constructed of half-mil polyethylene, weighed 1360 kg and had a volume of 1.4 cu m and a 0.25-km dia. Launched and tracked with facilities of the Navy’s Skyhook program, the balloon rose over Hudson Bay and moved westward 805 km. After 18 hrs, it descended to 30 km, where the payload was separated by radio command and parachuted to the ground. (Naval Research'Reviews, Nov 74, 13) .
Hills 1000 m high on the planet Mercury, as well as valleys 700 m deep and craterlike surface features 50 km across, had been found by Jet Propulsion Laboratory radar astronomers during high-resolution scans, NASA announced. The features were charted by directing high-powered beams at Mercury in 14 probes between 15 July and 8 Dec. 1972 from Goldstone Deep Space Station’s 64-m dish antenna. Months of computer work had analyzed the data and formulated a map of radar findings, which might be verified 29 March when Mariner 10 (launched 3 Nov. 1973) was scheduled to fly past and take the first closeup photos of Mercury, (nasa Release 74-12)
The Shuttle Avionic Integration Laboratory (sail) was being established at Johnson Space Center to provide a central facility for testing and evaluating avionics, flight software, flight procedures, and ground equipment for the space shuttle.

A breathing system developed by Johnson Space Center using technology for solid-propellant rocket-motor cases was being evaluated in the field by Houston firemen. New air tanks were built of spiral-wound glass fiber over an aluminum liner to provide a lighter and more durable system. (NASA Release 74-320) 10 December-16 January 1975: nasa launched West German-built Helios 1 solar probe at 2:11 am Est from Eastern Test Range on a Titan IIIE— Centaur vehicle, putting it on a path that would take it closer to the sun than any spacecraft had yet traveled. The spacecraft first entered a parking orbit and then an elliptical orbit of the sun with a 0.985-au aphelion, 0.3095-au perihelion, 190.15-day period, and 0.02° inclination to the ecliptic. All vehicle systems performed normally during launch. The Titan-Centaur carried a Delta solid-fueled rocket-motor kick stage as a 4th stage and required seven interdependent ignition systems. Following separation from the 1st stage, the Centaur, with 2300 kg of propellants remaining, began maneuvers to provide data for the 1977 Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, future synchronous orbit missions, and continued development of the launch vehicle. Maneuvers included a one-hour coast and restart, three-hour coast with thermal maneuvers, boost-pump operation experiment with igniter on, and zero-g boost-pump dead-head operation. Helios 1 was to investigate the fundamental solar processes and solar-terresfrial relations by studying the solar wind, magnetic and electric fields, cosmic rays, and cosmic dust from launch to the first perihelion, 0.31 au from the sun. The 370-kg spool-shaped spacecraft carried 10 instruments—7 West German and 3 U.S.—to measure the solar wind, magnetic field, and related shock waves; study radio waves and oscillations in the electron plasma; measure the spatial gradient of solar and galactic cosmic rays; observe composition and dynamics of interplanetary dust; and monitor x-ray activity of the solar disc. By 16 Jan. orientation and spin-rate maneuvers had been conducted and the high-gain antenna despun and pointed toward the earth. Control of the spacecraft had been passed to Germany. Instruments had been turned on and were operating normally with two exceptions: One of two antennas in the U.S. plasma-wave experiment had jammed during extension and unrolled inside the drive enclosure, producing an electrical ground and degrading all low-frequency data. Rewinding the antenna had not eliminated the ground. In addition, operation of the high-gain antenna for the West German plasma experiment produced a space . charge near the spacecraft, preventing detection of electrons with energies less than 100 ev. The medium-gain antenna would be used during selected periods. To prepare for its demanding mission, Helios 1, designed to withstand the highest temperatures ever demanded of a spacecraft, had been successfully subjected to six days at 644 K (700°F), the highest heat load expected at 0.3 au, during spring 1974 tests at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spacecraft had also withstood radiation 11 times the solar intensity at the outer edge of the earth’s atmosphere. Independent payload components, louver systems, optical surface reflectors and mirrors, and several layers of insulation dissipated spacecraft heat. In addition the spacecraft spun at one revolution per second to distribute evenly the heat coming from the sun. Temperatures within the experiment area were kept between 263 and 303 K (14° and 86°F). A second Helios spacecraft would be launched in 12 to 18 mos and information from the two spacecraft would be received simultaneously from widely differing locations, for comparison with each other and with data from Pioneer- and iMP-class spacecraft. Helios, the third cooperative U.S. and West German project, was agreed,on during 1966 talks. Following technical discussions and mission definition, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed 10 June 1969. NASA provided three scientific instruments, spacecraft technical support, launch vehicle and operations, and initial tracking and data acquisition and flight operations. The German Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (bmft) designed, built, and tested the spacecraft and provided seven scientific instruments, data acquisition and analysis, and spacecraft control. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for NASA project management; Lewis Research Center had responsibility for the launch vehicle.

The Senate approved the House-Senate Conference report on H.R. 13998 recommending a $3.267-billion FY 1975 NASA authorization. The compromise between the 9 May Senate bill and the 25 April House bill would authorize $805 million for the space shuttle, a $5-million increase over the President’s requested funding instead of the $20-million increase voted by the House. An $18.8-million increase in space applications, instead of the Senate’s $23-million increase, dropped specific designation of $13 million for the erts-c spacecraft, but the Conference report recommended that the project be promptly initiated and it retained the Senate’s $3-miIIion addition for a Thor-Delta to launch erts-C. The Conference bill would decrease manned space flight operations funding by $10 million, instead of the Senate’s $5-million cut and the House bill’s $15-million cut. It would retain the Senate’s $5.1-million addition for aeronautical research and add 4.9 million for energy research, as well as the House-and-Senate-voted $2 million for research in shortterm weather phenomena and the House-added $1 million for ground propulsion research.

The first system to use solar energy to heat a U.S. school began operation in Timonium, Md. The $568 000 project, jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and AAl Corp. [see 2 Feb.], was rushed into operation in six weeks to use the remainder of the winter’s chilly days to gather experimental data for future solar heating systems. (Richards, W Post, 8 March 74, C2) 7, 12-14 March: Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space Science, testified on NASA’s space science program before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications during FY 1975 authorization hearings: A Solar Maximum Mission (smm) satellite was proposed for FY 1975 design study and launch in the next period of maximum solar activity, 19781979. smm would investigate solar flares and related phenomena and their effects on the solar-terrestrial system, making, for the first time, simultaneous measurements of flares across the electromagnetic spectrum—within a national program of satellite, sounding rocket, and ground-based observations of the sun during maximum activity. The spacecraft would be shuttle-retrievable for refurbishment and reflight with advanced solar physics experiments in the 1980s. Requested funding for the Large Space Telescope (Ls’r) for FY 1975 was $6.2 million, to proceed with design of telescope optics, detectors, and support systems. NASA had originally planned to spend about $10 million in FY 1975 on the lst—to be launched on the space shuttle in 1980—but reduced the request to reflect the four- to six-month delay in shuttle development. NASA—in cooperation with the Naval Research Laboratory, Sandia Laboratories, and West Germany—was developing an Aries sounding rocket to support the physics and astronomy program. Aries, which used the 2nd stage of surplus Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles, would provide a greater lift and longer flight time than possible at the price of rockets now in use. Cost overruns on the 1975 two-spacecraft Viking mission to Mars could total 10% of the original $838-million estimate for the program because of hardware development problems. Major problems with the biology instrument included packing the sophisticated instruments into a small volume, development of very small valves to inject sufficiently small amounts of nutrients into Martian samples, and thermal control. The instrument was running $21.2 million over the budgeted cost. Difficulties also had been encountered in producing enough 0.005-cm plated magnetic wire of uniform characteristics for the onboard computer. Dr. Naugle said that, although the overall coniplexity of the spacecraft had been underestimated, “we expect these problems to be solved and to launch both Viking spacecraft on schedule in 1975.” (Transcript) Experiments were designed to demonstrate an attitude control accuracy of better than three arc minutes using a gas jet system, measure the performance in orbit of operational infrared sensor components, demonstrate an inexpensive Canopus sensor of high reliability, measure the density of sun-reflecting particles near the spacecraft, determine interference generated by the propane gas control system, demonstrate a basic sensing element with application in digital sun and earth albedo sensors, and measure degradation of silicone solar cells in orbit. NASA’s objective of placing the satellite in an earth orbit that would permit achievement of the scientific objectives was met, and the mission was adjudged a success 19 March. Under a December 1972 Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the U.K.’s Dept, of Trade and Industry, NASA would be reimbursed for launch vehicle and services. Developed for the U.K. by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Ltd., the 83.5-by 66.5-cm, 92-kg spacecraft was powered by a four-panel 250-cm-long solar array of 1800 solar cells. Miranda was deployed in a fully sunlit polar orbit with a yo-yo despin system and its attitude control system acquired the sun through three sun sensors. The eighth NASA launch of a U.K. satellite and the fourth on a Scout vehicle—Miranda carried the names of 80000 Boy Scouts from nine U.S. states on a microdot.

A high-temperature metal alloy and a self-lubricating' bearing material, both developed at Lewis Research Center, had been chosen by Industrial Research magazine as 2 of the 100 most significant products of the year, NASA announced. Composed principally of tungsten, nickel, and aluminum, the alloy was three times stronger at 1480 K (2200°F) than any existing commercial cast-nickel-base alloy. The bearing material—a product of glass, metal, and calcium fluoride—functioned at temperatures up to 1170 K (1650°F). Both products would be used for more efficient and cleaner turbine engines, electric-power generating systems, and other high-temperature devices. (LeRC Release 74-51; Industrial Research, Oct 74) The spacecraft did not pass through either sun or earth occultation, and communications with the Deep Space Network stations were uninterrupted. The second flyby was adjudged successful 3 Oct. A third flyby was planned for March 1975. Preliminary results, presented at a 23 Sept, press briefing at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, indicated that scarps and evidence of volcanism observed on the first flyby were pervasive and not localized. The scabby hills detected on the first encounter in an area opposite the Caloris Basin did not reappear, suggesting that such terrain was peculiar to that site.

The bill—passed as recommended to the House by its Committee on Appropriations 21 June—appropriated $3,203 billion to NASA, $44.1 million below the FY 1975 budget request and $63.9 million below the FY 1975 authorization. Research and development funds totaled $2,327 billion, construction of facilities $135.67 million, and research and program management $740 million. An additional $4,435 million had been provided in the Special Energy Bill. The House cut $6.2 million authorized as planning funds for the Large Space Telescope, noting that the lst was not among the top four priority telescope projects selected by the National Academy of Sciences. Also the House deferred the $8.0 million requested to initiate seasat and recommended that the satellite be configured to fly on an early mission of the space shuttle. The Committee urged NASA to reprogram funds to begin work on erts-c as soon as possible but directed the agency not to reprogram any funds for cost overruns on the Viking project without requesting additional funds from Congress. Other cuts from the authorization included $15.8 million for the construction of facilities and $9.6 million for research and program management. (CR, 26 June 74, H5746-73; Com Rpt 93-1139)
U.S. District Court Judge Joseph C. Waddy denied a request by the American Federation of Government Employees for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked NASA plans to lay off or reduce in grade 657 employees at Marshall Space Flight Center. The denial followed a 30 May temporary restraining order issued by Judge Waddy in response to an amendment to a 1967 suit filed by the AFGE against NASA and the Civil Service Commission. The suit challenged NASA’s alleged hiring of private contractors for vacated civil service jobs.

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said, “We want to produce a study that will assist nasa in presenting the best possible aeronautics program relevant to national needs, for the remainder of this century, to the Administration, the Congress, and the people.” In the aeronautical world market, the U.S. had sold more than $235 billion worth of products—not including space products—over the past 25 yrs, maintaining a favorable balance of trade for a nation that might otherwise have been in the red. In preparing this long-range study, “we have the great responsibility of indicating how America’s pre-eminent position in areonautics can be maintained and enhanced. The stakes are too high for any other approach.” (NASA Activities, 15 Oct 74, 2-3, 11-13; NASA oast, Civil Aircraft Progs Off, interview, 13 Nov 75) .
A mainshaft seal for turbine engines was being developed at Lewis Research Center to reduce wear, maintenance, and fuel consumption. By creating a thin gas film, the self-acting lift-pad seal eliminated contact between the seal bore and the rotating shaft shoulder except at startup and shutdown. The seal functioned at higher pressures, speeds, and temperatures than conventional contact seals and, with its low wear and leak rate, would be used in the NASA space shuttle liquid-oxygen pump.

Inflation would force even more extensive cuts in NASA operations if funding did not increase in the next few fiscal years, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported in a survey of nasa belt-tightening. The magazine quoted nasa Comptroller William E. Lilly as saying cost contracts for major spacecraft programs had a 9-12% inflation rate. The overall effective impact of inflation was 7—7.5% at NASA, but these averages were much lower than for many specific areas. Although materials increases were averaging 15-20%, particular increases ranged from 0-100%. The 7% inflation rate in Center supplies was being absorbed by using inventories and by decreasing the use of supplies. Utility cost increases of 20-30% at NASA Centers had been countered by lower use— a 30% cut—but Centers were still paying 10-15% more. Overall wage rates could increase 20-30% over the next three years, Lilly had said, because of a trend-setting agreement between the Boeing Co. and the International Assn, of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Support service contracts were showing a 7-9% yearly inflationary increase. NASA Centers were seeking new solutions. At Goddard Space Flight Center, more fixed-price contracts were being issued, but predicting economic changes was problematic, according to William R. Mecca, gsfc Deputy Director for Administration and Management, gsfc had begun limiting data acquisition from spacecraft and drawing up contingency plans for many unmanned programs—like the International Sun-Earth Explorer Spacecraft program and the International Ultraviolet Explorer program—to save costs if primary plans began to exceed spending limits. Marshall Space Flight Center had reduced its work force by 850— about 15%—since June 1973 and had closed 47 structures. Lewis Research Center had cut its power needs 7%, using a transient data-record-ing system to reduce operating hours. Johnson Space Center, along with others, had been hiring young persons rather than high-salaried experienced persons. JSC electric costs were still increasing even though the Center had reduced its exterior lighting by 75% and its interior lighting by 33%. Kennedy Space Center was phasing construction for shuttle and other programs, outfitting facilities to meet minimum initial operational requirements rather than for long-range mission models. Consideration was being given to advance procurement for lower costs and for preventing slowdowns from shortages. (Covault, Av Wk, 2 Dec 74, 38-42; Lilly, interview, 19 Sept 75)

The Sun quoted a NASA spokesman as saying that by 30 June the contractor and Civil Service work force at ksc would be 9450. The latest group to be laid off included mostly contract employees for Boeing Co., General Electric Co., and International Business Machines, Inc. (AP, B Sun, 12 Feb 74, A9)
Marshall Space Flight Center announced it had awarded a $169 000 contract for the study of hydrogen as a possible energy source, to the Institute of Gas Technology, Chicago, 111. The 10-mo study was to evaluate methods of producing large quantities of hydrogen and select a few of the most promising for follow-on studies. It was also to identify industrial and residential uses and estimate costs of developing technology. (msfc Release 74-207)
The Senate by voice vote passed H.R. 11864, the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974, as amended by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare 14 May. The Senate bill would authorize $5 million to nasa and $5 million to the Department of Housing and Urban Development in FY 1975 for development of new or existing solar technology and $40 million to hud over the next four years to carry out the demonstration. The development and demonstration were to be carried out within five years. NASA functions and funds could be transferred to the Energy Research and Development Administration if erda was established. (CR, 21 May 74, S8761-77)
President Nixon transmitted to Congress the Aeronautics and Space Report of the President: 1973 Activities. In his transmission message the President said: “This year has been particularly significant in that many past efforts to apply the benefits of space technology ... to problems on Earth are now coming to fruition.” Data from Skylab and Earth Resources Technology Satellite Erts 1 were being used for applications including resource discovery and management, environmental information, and land use planning. Communications satellites had become a principal method of international communication and important in meeting national defense needs. Skylab had provided new information on the energy characteristics of the sun that could aid understanding of thermonuclear processes and contribute to development of new energy sources. Skylab had proved that man could effectively live and work in space for extended periods of time. Advances in aeronautics had contributed to defense of the Nation and helped reduce aircraft congestion and provide quieter, safer, more economical and efficient aircraft. The report said that in previous years NASA’s emphasis in space had been to expand human knowledge of phenomena, develop and operate space vehicles, and preserve U.S. leadership in aeronautics and space technology. But 1973 had been the year of “cashing in” on the technology development and knowledge obtained from lunar and space exploration programs. (CR, 8 April 74, H2677; Text)

Marshall Space Flight Center awarded more than $28.2 million in contracts of $25 000 or more. Among awards were $2 253 300 to Inscho’s Mechanical Contractors, Inc., for construction of the X-Ray Telescope Facility at msfc ; also $695 000 to Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and $687 201 to Martin Marietta Corp., for Large Space Telescope support system module studies, (msfc Release 75-18) 1974 in Summary The U.S. orbited 28 payloads in 22 launches during the year. The U.S.S.R. orbited 95 payloads in 81 launches; Italy launched 2 payloads, using NASA launch vehicles; and Japan launched 1. U.S. launches included 16 payloads in 14 NASA launches and 12 spacecraft in 8 Dept, of Defense launches. For the first year since 1967 the U.S. launched no men into space, although Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue completed the longest mission yet accomplished by man when they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean 8 Feh. after 84 days in space. The U.S.S.R. orbited three two-man crews during the year, including two crews to dock with the Salyut 3 space station. The Soyuz 14 crew docked and worked aboard the laboratory for nearly 16 days, but Soyuz 15 failed to dock and it returned to earth after 48 hrs in space. Soyuz 16 tested the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project configuration in December. The U.S.S.R. also launched the Salyut 4 orbiting space station, to be joined by a two-man crew in January 1975. The 16 NASA-launched payloads—li paid for by domestic and foreign corporations or foreign governments—included 7 communications, 1 applications technology, 2 meteorological, and 6 scientific satellites. These were in addition to 2 Italian-launched cooperative scientific satellites. Comsats included two spacecraft launched for United Kingdom military communications ■—Skynet IIA into too low an orbit, followed later by the successful Skynet IIB, Westar 1 and 2, launched for Western Union Telegraph Co., were the first U.S. commercial domestic communications satellites. The most complex and versatile of the Applications Technology Satellites, Ats 6, went into orbit in May. The spacecraft was transmitting medical and educational telecommunications to small inexpensive ground stations in remote areas of the U.S. and would, in 1975, he positioned to broadcast educational programs to 5000 villages in India. Symphonie 1 was launched for France and West Germany as the first of two experimental communications satellites. Intelsat-lV F-8 was launched for Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, and Amsat Oscar 7 for Radio Amateur Satellite Corp. as a secondary payload on the Noaa 4 launch. The two meteorological satellites included Synchronous Meteorological Satellite Sms 1, launched for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to provide continuous day and night images of cloud cover over the U.S. and Atlantic Ocean for the first time. Sms 1 was the first meteorological satellite in synchronous orbit. Noaa 4 was launched as part of noaa’s global weather watch program. All but one of NASA’s six scientific payloads were cooperative efforts with foreign countries. Miranda (UK-X4) was launched for U.K. to measure the density of sun-reflecting particles near the spacecraft as well as test spacecraft systems. Spain’s first satellite—Intasat, put into polar orbit as a secondary payload with Noaa 4—began studies of the ionosphere. Two spacecraft were launched in cooperation with West Germany: Aeros 2 to measure aeronomic parameters of the upper atmosphere and solar ultraviolet radiation, Helios 1 into solar orbit to investigate interstellar space closer to the sun than any previous spacecraft had and to gather extensive new data on the sun. NASA and The Netherlands joined to orbit The Netherlands Astronomical Satellite Ans 1 to study stellar uv and x-ray sources. NASA’s only all-U.S. scientific payload, Hawkeye 1 (Explorer 52), was launched into polar orbit to study plasma properties of the magnetosphere over the north polar cap. A Titan-Centaur proof-flight vehicle carrying a Viking spacecraft model and a sphinx satellite failed to achieve orbit and was destroyed during launch operations. The new NASA launch vehicle later successfully launched Helios 1. Italian launch crews, using NASA launch vehicles, launched two satellites into earth orbit from the San Marco launch platform in the Indian Ocean off the East African coast. San Marco 4 in February carried two U.S. and one Italian experiment into orbit to measure diurnal variations in the equatorial neutral atmosphere. Ariel 5 was launched in October for U.K., to study galactic and extragalactic x-ray sources, in the first Italian launch for a country other than the U.S. or Italy. Japan launched its fifth satellite, Tansei 2—Japan’s first on a guided booster. In addition to the three manned Soyuz missions^ the U.S.S.R. launched 2 Salyut space stations; 3 unmanned Soyuz spacecraft identified as Cosmos 638, 656, and 672 ; 7 Molniya comsats; 5 Meteor meteorological satellites; 2 cooperative Intercosmos; 2 Luna lunar probes; and 71 spacecraft under the Cosmos designation. Space Science and Exploration Besides the new scientific satellites, NASA continued systematic exploration of the solar system as Pioneer 11, launched in April 1973, sped to within 42 000 km of Jupiter 3 Dec. The spacecraft photographed the giant planet and its moons, transmitting new information on the planet’s weather patterns, atmosphere, and radiation belts. Data from Pioneer 11 and its predecessor Pioneer 10, which had encountered Jupiter in December 1973 revealed that Jupiter was hotter than previously estimated and composed largely of liquid hydrogen. Cyclones and anticyclones stretched completely around the planet with rising grey-white cloud ridges extending 20 km above Jupiter’s distinctive orange-brown belts. Jupiter’s great red spot was probably the vortex of a great storm that had- raged along a 400 000-km front for centuries. At year’s end Pioneer 11 was speeding toward rendezvous with Saturn to give man his closest look at that planet while Pioneer 10 raced to cross the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto and become the first spacecraft to leave the solar system. Meanwhile Mariner 10—after passing within 5800 km of Venus and sending back new information on particle environment, mass, and density of that planet—made two successful flybys of Mercury in March and September. The spacecraft transmitted data that gave scientists mass measurements 100 times better than previous ones, described a detached, well-defined bow shock wave, and showed temperatures varying from 90 K on the night side to 700 K on the day side ( — 300°F to 800°F). During the two encounters the spacecraft photographed 45% of the planet’s surface. By the end of the year Mariner 10 was headed for a third Mercury encounter in March 1975. Preparations for the two 1975 Viking missions to Mars continued with the qualification-testing of Viking science instruments, engineering subsysterns, and entire orbiter and lander spacecraft. During the last quarter of the year the lander successfully completed critical surface simulation tests that included subjecting the spacecraft to temperatures approximating Martian conditions and dropping it from 0.6 m to determine the effects of landing shocks on the integrated Viking equipment. A detailed spacecraft design for the 1977 Mariner mission to Jupiter and Saturn was completed while a major effort to find a satisfactory way to protect the spacecraft from Jupiter’s strong radiation continued. A major new space science start, approved in nasa’s FY 1975 budget, was the 1978 dual Pioneer-Venus mission to obtain detailed measurements of the Venus atmosphere with an orbiter and four atmospheric entry probes. Hughes Aircraft Co. was chosen in February for spacecraft design, with an option for spacecraft development, and experimenters and scientific instrumentation were selected in June. NASA continued preparations to place the Large Space Telescope in earth orbit to make detailed astronomical observations 10 times deeper into space than possible before. During 1974, preliminary system definitions and advanced technological development were carried out on selected elements of the LST. Besides preparing for future missions, scientists continued analysis of data accumulated from previous missions. A Lunar Data Analysis and Synthesis program began to correlate existing data and data still being collected by the five Apollo lunar surface-experiment packages (alsep) left on the moon during the lunar landing program. With the conclusion of the Skylab flight program, large volumes of new data on the sun and the earth and the most comprehensive inflight data yet on man’s adaptation to space flight became available. During the year sounding rockets, balloons, telescopes, and instrumented aircraft continued to increase knowledge of the universe. NASA launched nearly 80 sounding rockets from sites around the world. A significant accomplishment was the launch of 54 sounding rockets within 24 hrs to support the Joint NASA-Air Force Atmospheric Layering and Density Distribution of Ions and Neutrals (aladdin) program. During 1974 scientists in programs outside NASA as well as in, using data from both orbital and suborbital programs, discovered a 13th moon of Jupiter, observed a pulsar that was a member of a double star system, obtained new data on the size and shape of the Crab Nebula, discovered a galaxy six times larger than any previously known in the universe, and made the greatest advance yet in cometary research with the study of the Comet Kohoutek, including first-time identification of water molecules in a comet. The U.S.S.R. continued a program of space exploration with the launch of lunar probes Luna 22 in May and Luna 23 in October. Luna 22 studied the lunar surface and atmosphere from lunar orbit. Luna 23 was damaged while landing on the moon’s surface and its work was discontinued after three days of equipment testing. Space Transportation and Technology The space shuttle program accelerated, with funding increasing from $475 million in FY 1974 to $800 million in FY 1975. But this total reflected an $89-million cut by the Office of Management and Budget from planned space shuttle funding, delaying the program four to six months. The final maj or contract was awarded and design work neared completion; by year’s end the program moved into hardware test and fabrication stages. Construction of the shuttle runway at Kennedy Space Center began in April and throughout the year contracts were awarded for additional space shuttle facilities. The European Space Research Organization selected VFW-Fokker/ ehno Raumfahrttechnik GmbH as prime contractor to design and build Spacelab for missions on the shuttle. Primary efforts were directed toward planning early shuttle missions and making analyses for a NASA mission model. In solid propulsion technology, the final motor—the first with a restart capability—in a series of high-efficiency solid-fueled motors was successfully static-fired. The October firing marked the first time a spacecraft solid-fueled motor had been fired, quenched, reignited, and requenched. Another significant step was the static-firing of a thermally sterilized solid-fueled motor. Electric propulsion—attractive as auxiliary propulsion for long-life station-keeping and attitude control—took a stride forward with the tests of a 4.5-millinewton (0.001-lb-thrust) ion engine aboard Ats 6. In spacecraft energy system technology, solar cells were made from a silicon ribbon grown directly from the liquid state, a critical first step in low-cost manufacture of solar cells. Other advances were made in laser, nuclear, atmosphere-entry, material-and-structures, guidance, and control-and-information technology. The X—24B lifting body completed 15 flights in the NASA and Air Force program to develop a safe piloted vehicle for reentry from space flight and to develop hypersonic technology. Following the first supersonic flight in March, the vehicle’s performance and handling qualities were evaluated in the speed range between mach 1.6 and landing. NASA’s aeronautics research and development program to reduce fuel consumption, reduce undesirable environmental effects, improve safety, and advance technology continued during the year. Flight tests of an F—111 equipped with the NASA-developed supercritical wing demonstrated a 15% reduction in fuel consumption. Other tests using flexible aircraft skin concepts, composite materials, active-control technology, and alternative fuels also demonstrated reduced drag and potential fuel savings. In NASA’s refan program—an effort to reduce noise of the JT8D engine that powered most of the Nation’s narrow-body commercial fleet—three refanned engines demonstrated in ground tests that the ground area affected by objectionable noise from commercial aircraft could be reduced by 75%. In another technique, a DC-8 using a NASA-developed two-segment landing approach reduced the ground area affected by excessive noise 53%. Efforts to measure and reduce aircraft engine exhaust in the atmosphere continued with the Global Air Sampling Program. A United Air Lines, Inc., Boeing 747 equipped with an atmospheric sampling instrument began measuring aircraft pollution on commercial air routes, while the clean combuster technology program was expanded to reduce engine emissions. Programs to improve aircraft safety continued to make progress. Techniques to reduce hazardous trailing vortices were flight-tested. A NASA-developed prototype system to track aircraft wakes near airports, allowing traffic controllers to adjust aircraft spacing more closely, was being operationally evaluated at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City. The Dept. ,of Defense A-10 close-air-support program moved into production stage, with the first of six aircraft in final assembly and checkout. Production of an initial increment of 22 aircraft was approved in December, with a full production decision expected late in 1975. dod’s B-l advanced strategic bomber moved through engine preliminary flight-readiness tests in April, rollout in October, and first flight in December. Following flight testing, a production decision would be made in 1976. The first operational F—15 advanced tactical fighter was delivered in November. At year’s end 20 test aircraft had accumulated more than 300 flight hrs. International Cooperation Aerospace activities continued to become more international. Of the 16 NASA-launched payloads, 10 were cooperative efforts with foreign organizations. In addition, the 2 Italian-launched payloads carried U.S. experiments. During the year negotiations were completed on an agreement for NASA to furnish reimbursable launches for three future synchronous-orbit Japanese satellites, nasa-esro Spacelab working groups met throughout the year on experimental objectives and user requirements. Investigators from 42 countries and 5 international organizations were selected for Earth Resources Technology Satellite follow-on investigations, and Italy and Iran signed agreements with NASA to build earth stations to receive ERTS data directly. The 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project neared flight readiness. Joint compatibility tests of communications and docking systems were carried out and intensive joint flight-crew and flight-controller training was begun. Apollo hardware was completed. The U.S.S.R launched two unmanned and one manned Soyuz spacecraft (Cosmos 638 and 672 and Soyuz 16) to check out new systems and equipment for the joint mission. NASA and the Soviet Academy of Sciences approved public information plans and plans for prelaunch testing at the U.S. and U.S.S.R. launch sites. U.S. and Soviet specialists exchanged information about the moon, planets, environmental problems, and biomedical results from U.S. and U.S.S.R. space flights. U.S. and Soviet scientists preparing a joint experiment using Ats 6 data met in the U.S. in October for technical coordination. And plans were formulated in October for a U.S. life science experiment to fly on the next available Soviet biological satellite. For 101 days, June-September, the U.S. and 69 other countries participating in the Global Atmospheric Research Program’s Atlantic Tropical Experiment monitored nearly every known meteorological factor along a 52-million-sq-km tropical area of land and sea from the eastern Pacific Ocean across Latin America, the Atlantic Ocean, and Africa to the western Indian Ocean. More than 4000 persons using 41 ships, 40 instrumented buoys, 12 aircraft, and 6 satellites probed from 1.6 km below the sea surface to the top of the atmosphere to improve weather predictions, assess pollution, determine the feasibility of large-scale weather modification, and establish new bonds of international cooperation. " Applications and Energy During 1974 space technology continued to make significant contributions to the quality of life. In addition to 1974-launched Ats 6, Sms 1, Westar 1 and 2, Intelstat-lV F-8, and Noaa 4 to improve weather predictions and communications on the earth—Erts 1, launched in July 1972, completed 29 mos in operation. Erts 1 had transmitted more than 100 000 photos covering three fourths of the world’s land masses and coastal areas, erts data—used to monitor urban and agricultural development, locate air and water pollution, update maps, and find new water and mineral resources—had been provided to more than 300 U.S. and foreign investigators in government, universities, and industry, erts—b development continued on schedule. NASA’s pollution monitoring program—to develop and demonstrate technology to monitor atmospheric and water pollution—completed its second year. Procurement for design and construction of the Nimbus-G Oceanographic and Air Pollution Observing Satellite, planned for 1978 launch, was under way. The Lower Atmospheric Composition and Temperature Experiment (lacate) was demonstrated in May and a test in the advanced applications flight experiment program-—using balloons, sounding rockets, and aircraft as well as ground-based experiments—successfully gathered atmospheric data over a five-hour period. dod expanded and improved its Defense Satellite Communications System and let contracts for Phase 1 navstar global positioning satellites. The Defense Meteorological Satellite program continued to furnish weather data for military and civilian use. Space technology continued to be applied to medicine. A digital computing cardiotachometer to monitor heart rates, an automated blood pressure monitoring system, and a new method of attaching artificial limbs were among the NASA-developed contributions demonstrated in 1974. An Office of Energy Programs was established in NASA to focus the application of its aerospace technology to energy needs. In addition to programs to reduce aircraft air pollution and energy consumption and develop new fuels, NASA, under the Solar Heating and Cooling Demonstration Act of 1974 and in cooperation with the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development and other Federal agencies, was investigating the use of solar energy for heating and cooling buildings. An experimental solar house at Marshall Space Flight Center would ultimately derive up to 85% of its heating and cooling energy from the sun. Solar heating and cooling were being demonstrated in school. NASA continued research on wind energy systems, with the construction of a 100-kw wind-powered generator at Lewis Research Center; low-pollution, low-fuel-consumption automotive engines; aerodynamically designed vehicles to increase fuel economy; energy conversion systems. NASA distributed some 300 new Tech Briefs and 30 special compilations of new technology items to 15 000 subscribers in business and industry. Use of Regional Dissemination Centers for space technology applicable to other uses increased 34%, to 4000 clients. Tracking and Data Acquisition The Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (stdn) supported some 40 flight projects during 1974, including all NASA’s earth-orbital missions as well as space projects of foreign governments and private industry. Congress authorized funds for procurement activities for a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (tdrss)—two earth-orbiting satellites leased by NASA to relay data between low-altitude spacecraft and a single ground station. The authority to proceed further was subject to additional congressional review of a NASA-owned versus a leased system. (Pres Rpt 74; NASA Release 74r-330; NASA Activities, 15 Dec 74; A&A 74)

Sites for the second mission were still being studied. (Transcript; O’Toole, W Post, 20 Nov 74, A3) 22 November-6 January 1975: NASA launched Skynet IIB, a U.K. military communications satellite, for the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Office as agents for the U.K. Ministry of Defense. The satellite was launched on a three-stage Thor-Delta launch vehicle from Eastern Test Range at 7:28 pm est into an orbit with a 36 965-km apogee, 185km perigee, and 24.6° inclination. The apogee kick motor, fired at 8:10 pm est on 24 Nov., circularized the orbit with an apogee of 36 595 km, perigee of 35 896 km, period of 24 hrs 19.4 min, and inclination of 2.2°. The spacecraft then drifted to its geosynchronous station at 50° E longitude over the Indian Ocean. NASA adjudged the launch a success 6 Jan. 1975. The first-generation Skynet A and B had been developed for the U.K. in the usaf’s Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program (idcsp) and launched by NASA 21 Nov. 1969 and 18 Aug. 1970. Skynet IIA failed to achieve a satisfactory orbit when launched 18 Jan. 1974 and reentered 25 Jan. The launch of Skynet I IB had been delayed from 19 Nov. by a defective component in the Delta 2nd-stage attitude control system.

Marshall Space Flight Center held a final review of the Zero-Gravity Atmospheric Cloud Physics Project Phase A Definition Study. The study established the feasibility of atmospheric cloud physics research on Spacelab and recommended preparation of a Phase B study, (msfc Orbital & Space Environmental Br, interview, 6 Aug 75; msfc Release 74-181) 9— 25 October: Johnson Space Center Flight Operations Aircraft Div. completed the first mission of Project Airstream, gathering high-altitude gaseous and particulate samples from the upper atmosphere in the Western Hemisphere with the NASA high-altitude WB-57F aircraft. Sampling missions, flown for the Atomic Energy Commission and the Dept, of Transportation, allowed AEC to determine the global distribution of atmospheric nuclear weapon test debris, both gaseous and particulate. Nine NASA crewmen alternated in the 14 flights of the first mission, logging 51 500 km in all. (JSC Release 74-269) 10— 30 October: NASA launched Westar 2 (Westar-B), the second U.S. commercial domestic communications satellite, for Western Union Telegraph Co. from Eastern Test Range at 6:53 pm edt on a Thor-Delta launch vehicle. The satellite was placed in a close-to-planned transfer orbit with a 36 107-km apogee, 231-km perigee, and 24.76° inclination. The apogee kick motor, fired 13 Oct., circularized the orbit with 35 766km apogee, 35 244-km perigee, 23-hr 42-min period, and 0.5° inclination. By 25 Nov. the comsat was operating normally at its station at about 90° W longitude above the equator. The launch had been twice delayed, once for investigation of the entire Delta program and once for a last minute check of a connector pin. When launched, the vehicle performed as planned with two minor exceptions (both due to human error): the 2nd-stage cold-gas redundant altitude-control system switched from primary to backup nozzles because the guidance system had been programmed with too low a moment threshold and the umbilical end fitting was damaged because a tether had been improperly installed. Neither problem compromised the NASA mission objective: to place the satellite in an orbit of sufficient accuracy for transfer into a stationary synchronous orbit while retaining sufficient stationkeeping propulsion to meet the mission lifetime requirements. The objective was met, and the mission was adjudged successful 30 Oct. Westar 2 joined Westar 1, launched 13 April 1974 and later placed in geosynchronous orbit at 99° W longitude. The Westar Satellite Communications System—consisting of Westar 1 and 2, a third satellite for later launch, and five ground stations—had the potential for general-purpose telecommunications throughout the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Western Union planned to make the system available to all users, largely through leasing the voice, TV, and data transmitting services. NASA would be reimbursed for the launch, (nasa mors, 1, 25 Nov 74; nasa Releases 74-147, 74-265; Westar Release, 12 Sept 74; SBD, 11 Oct 74,214)
Preliminary studies of the use of laser beams to monitor water temperature, turbidity, salinity, and other factors affecting quality were under way at the University of Miami under Kennedy Space Center contract. No method had been known for remote sensing of vertical temperature profiles in bodies of water, but now high-energy, coherent laser Beams could penetrate deep into the water. Measuring the return radiation was expected to yield data on a number of factors, offering a potential ecology tool, (ksc Release 121-74)
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and GTE Satellite Corp. filed a proposal with the Federal Communications Commission to operate a joint domestic satellite system. The system would serve the contiguous 48 states and Hawaii and could serve Alaska and Puerto Rico through earth stations owned by other companies. A joint system would improve network efficiency and reduce the number of earth stations to 7, from the 10 required for two separate systems. Three satellites operated by comsat General Corp. and provided to AT&T would serve the joint system and could handle 28 800 simultaneous telephone conversations. The FCC had approved separate domestic satellite systems for the two companies 12 Sept. 1973, directing them to work together to integrate the systems and negotiate agreements for handling communications traffic and equitable division of revenues from jointly rendered services.

Noting the space program’s emphasis had shifted earthward now that space flight was an accepted and almost routine part of life, John N. Wilford commented in the New York Times that “it is only natural that after surveying the canyons of Mars, the clouds and haze of Venus and the radiation belts of Jupiter, men turn back and take a new look at the earth and, in the words of T. S. Eliot, ‘know the place for the first time.’ ” (NYT, 10 Feb 74,7) Mars 5 was put into orbit around Mars at 6:45 pm Moscow time (11:45 am edt) 12 Feb., with a 32 500-km apogee, 1760-km perigee, 25-hr period, and 35° inclination. Mars 6 and 7, launched 5 and 9 Aug. 1973, would approach Mars in March. During a 22 Sept. 1973 interview with Tass, Director Roald Sagdeyev of the Space Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences had said one of the four Mars probes would softland near the Martian south polar cap to test the physical properties of the soil and surface rocks and check the possibilities of transmitting TV pictures of the surrounding terrain to earth.

Interstellar space flight appeared possible, British Interplanetary Society engineers and scientists concluded after the first 15 mos of a study to establish the feasibility of flight outside the solar system. Costs would be high, but so far none of the engineering difficulties seemed insoluble. The chief limitation that might delay such a project was the low natural abundance of helium 3 for the nuclear microbombs proposed for propulsion. The Project Daedalus study had taken the star Barnard, six light years away, as a theoretical target. The journey was to be limited to 3040 yrs, a working lifetime. To achieve the necessary 51 000-km-per-sec velocity, bis scientists proposed a starship driven by a series of controlled nuclear explosions—each equivalent to 90 tons of TNT—occurring at the rate of 250 per sec. Microbombs, small pellets of nuclear fuel, would be compressed and heated to detonation point by electron beams. The rocket-powered boost phase would last 5 yrs, followed by a 35-yr coast. During flyby of Barnard, 10-20 probes would be released to search for inner planets and moons, sending back information to the mother ship for transmission to the earth. NASA had studied the nuclear-pulse propulsion concept for interplanetary exploration through a General Dynamics Corp. contract in 1963, but had suspended the study because of costs and the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

Widespread material and component shortages—increased by the oil embargo imposed by oil producing countries during the October 1972 Middle East war—were causing severe problems for the aerospace industry, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. Suppliers found it easier and more profitable to supply material such as aluminum to nonaerospace industry, which placed quantity orders without specific deadlines and rigid specifications. Government price controls had encouraged some suppliers to halt production or divert supplies to export markets, where profits could be two to three times above the domestic. A Hughes Aircraft Co. survey showed that reasons for shortages included a diminished supply of petrochemicals, which were the basis of most plastics and synthetic rubbers, and the curtailed production of materials requiring large amounts of energy for fabrication.

A National Academy of Sciences panel report to President Nixon recommended that the White House create a Council for Science and Technology. The Council would recommend how science and technology could be most effectively incorporated into the policy-making process. Three full-time members—drawn from the sciences, engineering, and related fields—would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. A Chairman, who would also serve as a member of the Domestic Council, would report to the President, and a staff of 25—30 experts would attack special problems, nas also recommended that the Council actively participate in the work of the National Security Council and play a role in areas of foreign policy affected by science and technology.

NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers testified during the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences hearings on the FY 1975 NASA authorization that space shuttle subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers had been selected in 32 states. Of the major subcontractors, 30 had already begun work. By June 1974 the total major subcontractor team would be at almost 100% of the required level. Shuttle employment was 16 000 and would reach 27 000 by June 1974 and 37 000 by June 1975. The first major subsystem test of the shuttle main engine would be made before the end of June 1974. Fabrication of Orbiter 1 would begin by the end of 1974, with the first horizontal flight test scheduled for the second quarter of 1977, the first manned orbital flight for the second quarter of 1979, and initial operational shuttle capability for 1980.

Dr. Yannevar Bush, who directed the development of the atomic bomb and mobilized U.S. scientific and technical resources during World War II, died in Belmont, Mass., at the age of 84 following a cerebral hemorrhage. Dr. Bush was Dean of Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1930s, when he developed the Bush differential analyzer, which led to development of the modern computer. He had been President of Carnegie Institution in Washington 1938-1955 and while there had served as Science Adviser to President Roosevelt. In 1938 he was elected Vice Chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics and was naca Chairman 1939-1941. President Roosevelt appointed him Chairman of the National Defense Research Committee in 1940 and Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1941. In that capacity, Dr. Bush organized an unprecedented team of engineers, scientists, industrialists, and military men and oversaw the development of the atomic bomb, radar, proximity fuse, rocketry, and problems of technical warfare.

In addition to the 54 rockets launched during a 24-hr period beginning at 1:00 pm edt 29 June, a pre-ALADDiN chemical experiment was launched aboard a Nike-Iroquois 28 June and four post-ALADDiN meteorological rockets were launched 1 July. Chemical releases made yellow to yellowish green fluorescent aurora-like vapor trails visible over the East Coast. The program was studying dynamic and structural conditions of the atmosphere 48-137 km above the earth. Using small meteorological probes, chemical releases, falling spheres, and more sophisticated spectrometer payloads, the rockets tracked and measured winds, wind shears, temperature and diffusion parameters, upper-atmosphere patterns and dynamics, and structure and composition. Data received from the rockets would be compared with data obtained by Explorer 51 (launched 15 Dec. 1973). The data would be used for predicting communications problems and satellite orbits as well as for weather forecasting and pollution studies, (wfc Releases 74-4, 74-5; afsc Release oip 065.74; AP, W Post, 30 June 74, B3)
Space engineers in India were testing subsystems for their first satellite launch vehicle, in preparation for eventual launch of a 40-kg satellite into near-earth orbit. All instruments and payload had been developed at Vikram Sarabhai space center. (Delhi Overseas Service, FBIS-India, 17 Sept 74, U4) Meanwhile a number of nations also were moving toward domestic satellite systems. Algeria had begun installation of the first of 14 earth terminals for its domestic satellite system following award of a $9.6-million contract to GTE International, a subsidiary of General Telephone & Electronics Corp. The system would begin operations soon after 1 Jan. 1975, when Algeria would lease one transponder from the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization. Brazil would begin leasing an Intelsat transponder for its domestic service 1 June 1975. Indonesia had begun development of two satellites of its own; initial terminals in a 25-station system would be easily convertible from operation with an Intelsat satellite to later operation with an Indonesian comsat. Malaysia was purchasing three ground terminals to use Intelsat comsats. The Phillippine government was considering a similar plan and, with Malaysia, possibility of switching from an Intelsat to Indonesia’s planned satellite. Saudi Arabia had installed two terminals with 11-m-dia antennas for domestic service, which, with the completion of two larger stations in mid-1975, would be moved to remote locations for use with an Intelsat or the planned Arab League satellite. {Av Wk, 23 Sept 74, 23; Johnsen, Av Wk, 30 Sept 74, 22; Hughes contract officer, interview, 27 June 75)
Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science, testified in FY 1975 authorization hearings before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences that Orbiting Solar Observatory oso-i, scheduled for 1975 launch into orbit, was expected to acquire ultraviolet solar spectra of the most detailed resolution ever obtained. Spacecraft and experiment assembly was to be complete by mid-1974. A cooperative program with the European Space Research Organization, called International Sun-Earth Explorers (isee), planned three satellites to make simultaneous measurements. Two spacecraft, “Mother” built by the U.S. and “Daughter” built by ESRO, would travel close together in the same highly elliptical orbit, measuring magnetic and electric fields, energetic particles, and plasma properties. The third spacecraft, called “Heliocentric” and built by the U.S., would be placed near one of the unique points in space where the earth’s and sun’s gravity balance each other. The spacecraft would travel around the sun and close to the earth to learn what radiation was impinging on the earth’s magnetosphere. Data from the three satellites would help to untangle spatial from temporal changes in radiation fields around the earth. A cooperative effort with esro and the United Kingdom would be the International Ultraviolet Explorer (iue) scheduled for launch into geosynchronous orbit in 1976 to observe high-resolution spectra in the uv with a telescope controllable from the ground in real time. Techniques gained would be applied later to NASA’s Large Space Telescope. Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition Gerald M. Truszynski reported deactivation of NASA’s transportable tracking station in Newfoundland and closing of Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network stations at Corpus Christi, Tex., and Carnarvon, Australia. The Newfoundland station, placed in caretaker status after the Skylab missions, would be reactivated for the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission and then permanently closed. The Deep Space Network portion of the Johannesburg station was being phased out beginning June 1974; the stdn facility would be phased out following the near-earth phase of the Viking mission. The closings would leave 15 stations, adequate to handle the projected workload for the next five years and consistent with long-range planning. (Transcript)
NASA announced selection of 39 scientists to provide experiments for the 1978 Pioneer twin missions to Venus. The selection, made from 162 scientists who had submitted proposals to NASA, included one scientist each from Germany and France.

Bobko—took part in training in Star City, near Moscow, for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. A ninth, Eugene A. Cernan, took part in the first two weeks of training, representing the Johnson Space Center Apollo Spacecraft Program Office. In addition to studying Soyuz spacecraft systems, the astronauts trained with the Soviet flight crews in simulators and mockups. They also continued planning procedures and checklists for the joint mission, (jsc Release 74-121; JSC Roundup, 30 Aug 74) 25 June-19 July: The Salyut 3 research station and—nine days later—the Soyuz 14 spacecraft carrying a two-man crew were launched into nearearth orbit to establish a U.S.S.R. manned orbital workshop. Salyut 3 was launched at 4:55 am local time 25 June (7:55 pm EOT 24 June) from Baykonur Cosmodrome near Tyuratam into orbit with 252-km apogee, 213-km perigee, 89.2-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass announced the purpose of the mission was to improve the station’s design, onboard systems, and equipment and to perform scientific research during space flight. By 30 June Salyut 3, which consisted of two cylinders more than 21 m in length and weighing some 18 500 kg, had been raised to a near-circular orbit with a 268-km apogee and 265-km perigee. Soyuz 14 was launched 3 July at 11:51 pm local time (2:51 pm EDT) from Baykonur Cosmodrome carrying Cosmonauts Pavel R. Popovich, commander and veteran of the 12 Aug. 1962 Vostok 4 mission, and Yuri P. Artyukhin, flight engineer, to rendezvous with Salyut 3. The launch was seen by Soviet citizens by delayed broadcast on Moscow TV. The spacecraft entered orbit with a 338-km apogee, 201-km perigee, 89.9min period, and 51.5° inclination. Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training, said during a 4 July Tass interview that the main objectives of the mission were “testing methods and systems of controlling the craft, improvement in the life-sustaining complex, [and] exploration of new possibilities of using both separate craft and groups of space objects to accomplish scientific and applied tasks in a nearearth orbit.” Tass also reported that a 4 July trajectory correction placed the spacecraft in an orbit with a 277-km apogee, 255-km perigee, 89.7min period, and 51.6° inclination. All spacecraft systems were successfully checked out and the crew was reported to be in good health. The Soyuz 14 cosmonauts rendezvoused and docked with Scdyut 3 on 5 July during their 17th orbit, successfully demonstrating techniques the Soviets would use during the July 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project maneuvers. After docking, Popovich and Artyukhin checked the station’s onboard systems and microclimate and entered the 99-cu-m three-room laboratory. During their 15-day mission the cosmonauts studied geological-morphological objects on the earth’s surface, atmospheric formations and phenomena, physical characteristics of outer space, and manufacturing techniques, as well as testing the Salyut space station’s improved design and solar-panel energy system. The crew also studied the influences of space on the human organism and exercised to prevent loss of muscle tone, using an onboard comprehensive trainer to simulate running, jumping, and weight lifting. . Tass reported 15 July that some Soviet scientists considered terminating the mission because unexpected, intense solar flares 4-8 July dramatically increased the radiation exposure. However, because the flares subsided and the space station’s orbit prevented excessive exposure, the crew’s work was not disrupted. While the cosmonauts worked in space, two Soviet researchers lived in a duplicate station on the ground, simultaneously performing the same work. All commands relayed to the orbiting Salyut 3 were first checked on the ground and alternate versions of decisions for unforeseen situations were calculated. On 8 July the U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project crew, in training at Star City for the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. mission in 1975, telegraphed congratulations to the Salyut 3 cosmonauts on their “great success.” They said they looked forward to meeting the two after their “happy return.” By 18 July the crew completed most experiments and began transferring equipment to Soyuz 14. After checking out spacecraft systems, the cosmonauts undocked 19 July. Retrorockets were fired, parachutes deployed, and Soyuz 14 softlanded at 5:21 pm Baykonur time (8:21 am edt) 140 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan 2000 m from the planned target after 15 days 17 hours 30 min in space. The crew left the spacecraft unaided, and on-the-spot medical checks showed the cosmonauts’ health was “good.” All mission tests were reported completed. For the first time, a U.S.S.R. orbital mission had been in touch with mission control continuously because of maritime tracking. Salyut 3 was the third space station orbited by the U.S.S.R. Salyut 1 had been launched 19 April 1971. A three-man crew on Soyuz 10 docked with the station 24 April but returned to earth without entering. A second crew, launched 6 June 1971 aboard Soyuz 11, entered the orbiting station and conducted scientific experiments for 24 days. The three died during reentry when an open valve evacuated air from the spacecraft. Salyut 2 was launched into orbit 3 April 1973 but apparently an explosion or wildly firing thrusters sent the station out of control, tearing off the solar panels and making the station uninhabitable, (gsfc Wkly SSR, 20-26 June, 3—10 July 74; gsfc SSR, 30 June, 31 Aug 74; Tass, FBis-Sov, 25 June-23 July 74; UPl, W Star-News, 14 July 74; Browne, NYT, 9, 20 July 74; SBD, 9, 27 July 74; A&A 1973)

Large numbers of scientists and engineers trained in a variety of traditional and interdisciplinary fields would be required over the next several years by increased energy research and development efforts, a Science editorial said. Numbers of graduating scientists and engineers were dropping each year and some signs of a shortage were appearing already. Top-level representatives from r&d agencies—including NASA, the Federal Energy Office, Office of Management and Budget, National Science Foundation, and the Atomic Energy Commission—should examine manpower needs and set up or fund a program for continuing assessment over the coming decade. “Dollar budgets can be changed quickly. Manpower budgets require longer planning time if both dollars and manpower are to be used wisely.” (Vetter, Science, 5 April 74, 11)
A Boeing 747 aircraft had been chosen to transport the space shuttle orbiter and related hardware from the West Coast to Kennedy Space Center, NASA announced.

NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers testified on the manned space program before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight during FY 1975 authorization hearings. Myers said NASA’s ability to hold close to the original cost target for the space shuttle in spite of schedule adjustments in the last two years was “due to bringing on our contractors below our cost estimates” and the ability 6f the management structure to remain dynamic and react to changes and “surprise problems.” He was confident that the average-cost-per-flight commitment of $10.5 million in 1971 dollars would be maintained. However, resolution of the protested selection of Thiokol Corp. for the solid-fueled rocket motor contract was necessary before work on the motor could begin; “a timely start of this . . . activity is very important to orderly progress in the shuttle development schedule.” In the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the astp spacecraft was to be delivered to Kennedy Space Center in the fall, joint docking system qualification testing and preflight docking system compatibility tests were to be completed during the winter, experiment hardware was to be qualified by early spring, and flight readiness activities were to be conmleted by spring, leading to the July launch. NASA had allocated $13 million for experiments for astp. More than 140 proposals from the scientific community had been evaluated by eminent scientists and medical doctors. The final, “first-rate” experiment package had been given final approval by the Administrator. Following astp, two Saturn Vs, two Saturn IBs, one complete and one partially complete command and service module, the unused Skylab backup Workshop cluster, and one astp docking module and system would remain unused. Acquisition cost of the hardware was $870 million. With the conclusion of the programs, the hardware would be stored. Total storage costs per year would be $100 000. After FY 1975, disposition of the hardware would have to be considered. (Transcript)
A prototype direct-readout ground station, designed by Goddard Space Flight Center to receive high-resolution weather photos from satellites, left gsfc for Dakar, Senegal. It was to play a key role in the Global Atmospheric Research Program’s Atlantic Tropical Experiment (gate) to study tropical weather patterns. Using the ground station, planners could quickly advise scientists aboard participating ships to focus attention on specific weather conditions and could route aircraft into regions where cloud development was detected.

The Aerospace Industries Assn, of America, Inc., predicted “a slight decline” in sales in 1974 after a jump of more than 10% in 1973, the New York Times reported. Industry sales were expected to total $24.7 billion in 1974, 1% lower than the 1973 boom that had pulled the industry out of a five-year slump. Aia President Karl G. Harr, Jr,, had said, however, that the energy crisis could bring a greater decline. Fuel shortages already had softened markets for commercial aircraft, and jet transport orders could taper off, although the Department of Defense was beginning a new generation of tactical and strategic weapons. Aerospace industry business with the space program was expected to continue its five-year decline, dropping by about 2.7% to sales of $2.3 billion in 1974. Profits of the industry had risen in 1973, to an average of 2.7% of sales after taxes, but employment dropped 1 % to 935 000 persons in 1973, and was expected to fall to 915 000 in 1974.

General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div. was awarded a $290 000 contract to study space shuttle and tug compatibility and develop detailed interface requirements. A second contract to General Dynamics, totaling $268 000, was awarded for a definition study of space tug avionics systems with emphasis on areas where transition from the ius to the tug would require significant hardware or operational changes. United Aircraft Corp. Pratt & Whitney Div. received a $375 371 contract to evaluate and verify the RL-10 high-area-ratio nozzle engine performance for space tug application. Under a $246 000 contract, Martin Marietta Corp. would develop concepts, techniques, and tools for tug fleet and ground operations, mission assignments, payload and orbiter integration, tug scheduling, and physical status, msfc awarded McDonnell Douglas Corp. a $293 277 contract to study ius-tug payload requirements compatibility and International Business Machines Corp. a $337 250 contract to study ius-tug orbital operations, (msfc Release 74-135) <f
A NASA design study for the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development’s modular integrated utility system (mius) program had revealed the Mius design could save 33% over conventional practices in providing utility services to a 648-living-unit garden apartment complex in Houston, Johnson Space Center reported. JSC had reported this result and similar savings from other studies at a recent two-day conference on technology transfer in Houston, (jsc Roundup, 11 Oct 74)
President Nixon was briefed on the space shuttle and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project at Johnson Space Center. Following a tour, the President and Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented the Sky lab 4 astronauts with NASA’s Distinguished Service Medal. Nixon praised the efforts of the “great American scientific, mechanical, and clerical communities” for their contributions to the space program. “You have contributed to . . . the spirit of a great country, which means always look out toward the unknown, go there, take any risk, make any sacrifice, and never be discouraged because sometimes you may fail.” Of the astp, President Nixon said that although systems of government were different, the U.S. wanted “to cooperate with the Russian people and with all the people on the earth in anything that will advance the cause of science, the cause of health, the cause of a better life foT all our children, as well, of course, as the cause of peace.” (jsc Roundup, 29 March 74,1; PD, 25 March 74,345-347)
A New York Times editorial noted that, within a matter of hours, instrument readings from Mariner 10’s 29 March close flyby of Mercury had “made all previous scientific writing and theorizing about Mercury obsolete. Where nearly complete ignorance had existed earlier, there is now a large, diverse and important body of hard information. . . . Even if the crippled spacecraft is unable to continue to transmit data it will have earned an indelible place in the history of space exploration.” (NYT, 1 April 74,30)
Two A-9 twin turbofan aircraft, Northrop Corp.’s unsuccessful contenders for the Air Force close air support aircraft, had been transferred to Flight Research Center, the frc X—Press reported. One of the aircraft would be used in three research programs: as a support aircraft in the trailing vortices research program; as a mother ship to air-launch supersonic Firebee drones in the remotely piloted research vehicle program; and as a test-bed aircraft in the Center’s nonpropulsive aircraft noise program. The second A-9 would be used for spare parts, (frc X—Press, 12 April 74, 2; frc proj off, interview, 21 Feb 75)
Deputy Secretary of Defense William P. Clements, Jr., approved Air Force plans for initial production of the A-10 close air support aircraft. The Dept, of Defense would release $39 million in FY 1975 funds for long-lead-time items. Approval was granted to buy 52 aircraft from the manufacturer with the provision that contract options to procure a smaller quantity be kept open. Selection of the A-10 for full development followed a competitive prototype flyoff in 1972. Since that time two A—10 prototypes had flown almost 500 hrs in test flights, (dod Release 346-74) During July: Dramatic changes in a star, altering its chemistry and foretelling its death, had been observed for the first time, Dr. Robert F. Kraft, California Lick Observatory astronomer, reported in Sky and Telescope. FG Sagittae, a superstar 8000 light years away in the constellation Sagitta, was undergoing a sudden cooling, abrupt changes in color and brightness, and increases in the number and amounts of heavy elements in its atmosphere. The changes, which occurred in every star that was exhausting its nuclear fuel, might also take place in our own sun, possibly in 10 billion yrs.
