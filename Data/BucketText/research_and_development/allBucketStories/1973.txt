The National Science Foundation released An Analysis of Federal R&D Funding by Function: FY 1963-73 (nsf 72-313). Federal expenditures for research and development were expected to grow faster than total Federal outlays in FY 1973 for the first time since FY 1965. Between FY 1972 and 1973 r&d expenditures were expected to rise 3.6%, with total outlays up 2.6%. The Federal R&D percentage of the total was expected to be 7.3% in FY 1973. Of total outlays for space research and technology, 98% was expected to go toward R&D, but the R&D share of the total outlay for international affairs and finance, veterans benefits and services, general government, and income security would be less than 1%. Functions other than national defense and space R&T had increased emphasis on R&D significantly 1963-1973, from 10% to an expected 23%. The trend toward more civilian-oriented programs within the Federal r&d total was continuing, with an expected rise of 2% between 1972 and 1973. (Text)
Ten Soviet scientists and engineers arrived at Johnson Space Center to help evaluate the docking system for the July 15, 1975, U.S.—U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission. Vladimir S. Syro-myatikov of the Soviet State Research Institute of Machine Building led the team, which would assist in evaluating the U.S. and Soviet sections of the docking module for proper mating and in checking pressure integrity and structural strength of the combined system. The U.S.-U.S.S.R. team also would make dynamic tests of the docking. The system would be studied under thermal extremes. JSC was testing full-scale development hardware built by both countries for compatibility and operation, (jsc Release 73—119)
Grumman Aerospace Corp. would lay off 1000 employees to reduce operating expenses, the New York Times reported. The expense paring had been ordered by Deputy Secretary of Defense William P. Clements to increase operating efficiency after the controversy over increasing costs of the Crumman-produced F-14 fighter aircraft. (Andelman, NYT, 3/28/73, P28) March 28—29:	Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science, testified before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications during NASA FY 1974 authorization hearings: The Office of Space Science had assumed total responsibility for collecting, handling, and analyzing data from the Apollo program, and “we plan to devote the next several years to their detailed analysis and interpretation. Our objective is a better understanding of the origin, history and present environment of the Moon, and the definition of goals and objectives of possible future flight programs. These studies will also use the data from the still-continuing flight program of the Soviet Union.” The French-built laser reflector on the Soviet lunar roving vehicle Lunokhod 2 deposited on the moon by Luna 21 (launched Jan. 8), “in addition to the three carried by Apollos 11, 14, and 15, provides another control point for lunar mapping studies and other scientific objectives. The close cooperation between the French and Soviets in putting the device on the Moon and between the Americans and French in securing early observations is a striking example of the possibilities for effective scientific cooperation in space among the nations of the world.” Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972) was “very much a pathfinder as it goes to Jupiter. We know Jupiter has intense radiation fields. We plan for Pioneer 10 to pass by Jupiter about three-and-a-half Jupiter radii from the planet. We think that Pioneer 10 at that distance . . . will be able to survive as it goes through those radiation belts. If by chance it does not, then we would probably retarget Pioneer G so that it stayed farther out.” If Pioneer 10 survived the radiation belts, “we would probably target Pioneer G closer so that we could get a better look at Jupiter and get more information about the intensity of the radiation belts as we get closer to Jupiter.” (Transcript) March 28-30:	A symposium on federally sponsored university research in transportation noise was conducted at Stanford Univ. by the Dept, of Transportation in cooperation with NASA and the National Science Foundation.

The skeleton crew at aec-nasa Space Nuclear Systems Office at Jackass Flats, Nev., would be disbanded by late June, snso Nevada Operations Chief John P. Jewett was quoted as saying. The facility would be shut down June 30 following termination of the nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (nerva) program [see Jan. 5]. More than $1.2 billion had been spent on program since its inception in 1959. (upi, Orlando Sentinel, 1/7/73)	! January 8-23:	The U.S.S.R. launched its Luna 21 unmanned lunar probe from Baykonur Cosmodrome at 11:55 am local time (1:55 am est). The “automatic station” was separated from the “satellite” in earth orbit and placed on a close to the planned trajectory for the moon. Tass said the purpose of the mission was to “further scientific studies of the moon and near-lunar space.” During the flight to the moon all systems were reported functioning normally. On Jan. 12 Luna 21 entered lunar orbit with 110-km (68.4-mi) apolune, 90-km (55.9-mi) perilune, 1-hr 58-min period, and 60° inclination. Orbital corrections were made Jan. 13 and 14 and on Jan. 14 the spacecraft was placed in an elliptical orbit with a low point of 16 km (10 mi) from the moon’s surface. Luna 21 softlanded on the eastern fringe of the Sea of Serenity Jan. 16 (Jan. 15 est) and released the 840-kg (1850-lb) self-propelled Lunokhod 2 vehicle to make scientific investigations of the moon’s surface. Lunokhod 2 resembled its predecessor, Lunokhod 1 (placed on the moon Nov. 17, 1970, by Luna 17). It carried flags, pennants with Lenin’s has relief, state coat of arms, and the inscription “50th Anniversary of the U.S.S.R.” and was equipped with a control system, radio and TV devices, and scientific instruments including a French-made laser reflector. The reflector was designed to measure the distance between the earth and the moon to within 20-30 cm (10-12 in). Between Jan. 16 and Jan. 23 Lunokhod 2, powered by solar batteries and controlled from the ground by a special crew, photographed the lunar soil, rocks, and panoramic moonscape; determined chemical composition of the surface layer; measured the glow of zodiacal light near sun; and looked for cosmic dust. A highly skilled ground crew maneuvered vehicle over the shortest and safest routes, orienting it to a complex relief map of route. Lunokhod 2 was turned to bypass obstacles without decreasing speed. On Jan. 23 Lunokhod 2 was commanded to terminate operations in preparation for lunar night. Luna 17 was the first unmanned spacecraft to land on the moon and deploy an automatic lunar explorer. The last mission in the series, the unmanned Luna 20 (launched Feb. 14, 1972), had landed on the moon and returned to earth with lunar samples, (gsfc SSR, 1/31/73; Tass fbis-Sov, 1/8/73, LI; 1/15-19/73, LI; 1/22-23/73, LI; 1/26/73, 4; SBD, 1/9/73, 38; Shabad, NYT, 1/17/73, C14) January 8:	Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, nasa Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp) Program Director, was quoted by Aviation Week & Space Technology as saying U.S.S.R. would use a U.S.-supplied very-high-frequency (vhf) transceiver on Soyuz spacecraft during rendezvous and docking maneuvers with Apollo spacecraft in July 1975 mission. Transceivers had been used in lunar modules for Apollo rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. The U.S. also would build a receiver for Apollo spacecraft that could operate on Soviet communication frequencies and might lend to the U.S.S.R. equipment for use by cosmonauts and astronauts during joint portions of mission. Dr. Petrone had said NASA engineers, in discussions with Soviet engineers, had noted that necessity of concentrating on interpreter for exchange of technical information had made them more aware of technical problems than they would have been in direct English conversation.

An Apollo 17 post-mission press conference—the last press conference of the Apollo program—was held at Manned Spacecraft Center. Geologist-astronaut Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt said the orange soil discovered at Shorty Crater in the moon’s Taurus-Littrow valley was “extremely young material,” less than 10 million yrs old, that probably had been formed by “local volcanic vent.” The discovery meant “that the moon is still active enough to produce volcanic rock.” With data from Apollo 17 and previous Apollo missions, “we now have the capability ... to get a first order understanding of the evolutionary sequence of the Moon and . . . recent history of the Sun from the soil, and maybe an increased understanding of the Sun itself.” Significance of Apollo lunar discoveries to mankind was that we could “hope to get insight . . . primarily for our children and their children” into the distribution of elements on the Earth and what processes effected that distribution for use in the future. Two revolutions in earth science during the decade had been “knowledge we’ve gained from the Moon” and “insight that terrestrial geologists have gotten into the formation of ocean basins. The effect of those two revolutions, particularly when they’re integrated ... is going to be profound.” If man could “understand the evolutionary sequences through which Earth has progressed . . . we’re going to be able to understand how to utilize the resources of that Earth.” Astronaut Eugene A. Cernan said lunar study might “tell us something about the possibility of some ancient existence of some civilization . . . possibly within our own universe.” Cernan and Astronaut Ronald E. Evans said they planned to stay in the space program. Schmitt said he would “stay in government service” but “I’m not sure what that service may be.” (Transcript; W Post, 1/6/73)

nasa Associate Administrator for Applications Charles W. Mathews described nasa’s Earth Observatory Satellite (eos) program in continued testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications during FY 1974 authorization hearings. The satellite, a potential new start for 1974, was intended to provide a multidisciplinary earth observations capability to support the areas of meteorology, environmental quality, earth resources and, in some respects, the earth and ocean physics program. The system would be the first major shuttle-compatible spacecraft with modularity, giving ability to retrieve and repair modular elements of the spacecraft, and the spacecraft might also be modular in basic size. “We may be able to build up a different size and weight spacecraft, using these modular techniques.” Elements were expected to serve the several disciplines without significant changes in components through the modular buildup. George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator in OAST, testified that Lewis Research Center was providing technical management on several Environmental Protection Agency contracts. Turbines, heat exchangers, combustors, and fuel controls obtained from NASA’s low-cost jet engine research would be evaluated for use in automobile turbine engines. A memorandum of understanding with epa would expand LeRC responsibility for component and system development for advanced automotive power systems and would exploit LeRC test facilities. (Transcript)

The dome-shaped top sections of the tanks sank after ground crews pumped 163 cu m (43 000 gal) of kerosene fuel into the Saturn IB’s four giant tanks and then drained some off to prevent expansion or overpressurization. A plastic cover protecting the tanks from a rainstorm prevented air from rushing into the aluminum tanks as the fuel was drained. The resulting vacuum buckled the tanks inward. Metallurgy experts were flown to KSC from Marshall Space Flight Center to assess the problem. (W Star-News, 10/24/73, A23; AP, B Sun, 10/24/73)	.

A Washington Evening Star and Daily News editorial commented on the supersonic transport effort: Environmental and economic problems and order cancellations had created a bleak outlook for the French and British Concorde. The modest budget request for research into the environmental impact of the U.S. SST by the Nixon Administration was realistic and should be approved by Congress “for the nation’s protection.” But the Administration should be “resigned to its defeat of 1971 in the building of an SST prototype.” (W Star & News, 2/8/73, A10) February 9:	Aspects of President Nixon’s FY 1974 budget requests were discussed in a Science article: The space program seemed “alive and well as it makes the transition into the post-Apollo era, despite recent fears . . . that its activities might be cut back severely.” NASA officials seemed confident the space shuttle would be built. The President had supported the project “although his new budget message contained no mention of the space program” and, “in Congress, it has survived handily all past attempts to kill it. The fact that the project helps sustain an aerospace industry that has suffered grievously from layoffs is a point lost on no one. And then too, NASA has going for it the fact that, both in Apollo and in the unmanned programs, it has generally met its goals and stayed within its budget.” Evidence existed “that the President does indeed look to a possible revival” of the supersonic transport “but not until later in the 1970’s. The new NASA budget contains $28 million—more than twice as much as last year’s budget—for research and development on supersonic technology. The work focuses on problems of noise, pollution, and efficiency of configuration.” (Carter, Science, 2/9/73, 551-2)

Overall procurement for KSC amounted to $192 882 000 in FY 1972 and $211 996 000 in FY 1971. (ksc Release 10-73, 1/16/73) January 17:	NASA Hq. held its first press briefing on Mariner 9 (launched
President Nixon sent a $268.7-billion FY 1974 national budget request to Congress—an increase of $18.9 billion over FY 1973. The budget projection for the succeeding fiscal year was included for first time, with the FY 1975 budget estimated at $288 billion. The national total for FY 1974 included an R&D budget of $17.4 billion (an increase of $300 million), with $3.1 billion requested for civilian and military space programs. Emphasis was on practical, immediate results from R&D rather than expanding scientific knowledge, with reduced priority for space research. The total request for NASA new obligational authority of $3,016 billion (1.2% of the total U.S. budget) was $391 million less than the FY 1973 noa of $3,407 billion. FY 1973 funds of $91 million were to be carried over to FY 1974. NASA expenditures were budgeted to increase $74 million, from $3,062 billion in FY 1973 to $3,136 billion. The FY 1973 increase of $11 million had been largely for space shuttle engine and airframe design and development. Of the FY 1974 budget request, $2,288 billion would go for R&D, $112 million for construction of facilities, and $707 million for research and program management. In manned space flight, elimination of Apollo funding reflected successful completion of the Apollo program with the Apollo 17 mission. Manned space flight operations—including $233.8 million for Skylab; $90 million for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp) ; $220.2 million for development, test, and mission operations; $21 million for space life sciences; and $15.5 million for mission systems and integration— would decrease from $879 million in FY 1973 to $580.5 million. The decrease reflected removal of space shuttle funding from the manned spacecraft operations category to separate program status. The FY 1974 budget request allocated $475 million to the space shuttle program for the orbiter, main engine, solid-fueled rocket boosters, external tanks, technology and related development, and vehicle and engine definition. Advanced missions would receive $1.5 million, to bring the total for manned space flight (including the shuttle) to $1,057 billion, down $100 million from FY 1973. Funding for space science programs would decrease $95.2 million, from $679.2 million in FY 1973 to $584 million in FY 1974. The decrease reflected suspension of the High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) program, in which two flights had originally been scheduled during 1976-1978. The physics and astronomy program would receive $95 million, down from $126.2 million; lunar and planetary exploration would receive $312 million, down from $331.9 million; and launch vehicle procurement would receive $177 million, down from $221 million. NASA’s space applications programs would receive $153 million (a decrease of $35.7 million), including $51 million for weather and climate research with satellites, meteorological soundings, experimental instruments and techniques, and for the Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp) ; $13.9 million for pollution monitoring, including $9 million for Nimbus-G oceanographic and air pollution observation satellite; $42.6 million for earth resources survey; $10.7 million for earth and ocean physics; $3.1 million for space processing; $22.1 million for communications, including a multi-use communications experiment satellite (ats-f) and a Canadian Cooperative Satellite (cas-c) ; $3 million for a multidisciplinary Earth Observing Satellite (eos) ; $4.5 million for shuttle experiment definition; and $2 million for application studies. The total requested for NASA’s aeronautics and space technology programs increased from $232.5 million in FY 1973 to $240 million. Aeronautical research and technology funding would increase from $150.6 million in FY 1973 to $171 million, including $22 million for experimental engine programs, $9.3 million for flight experiment programs, and $30 million for system technology programs. Space research and technology would receive $65 million, and nuclear power and propulsion $4 million (a drop from $17.1 million). Tracking and data acquisition funding would rise from $248.3 million in FY 1973 to $250 million. The Dept, of Defense FY 1974 budget of $85 billion was at an1 all-time high,	$4.1	billion above the	FY 1973 budget	authority, but was 28.4% of	total Federal outlays for	FY 1974 (a	percentage decrease from 29.0% in FY 1973 and the lowest proportion since 1950) and 6.0% of the	gross	national product	(the lowest	GNP	percentage in 24 yrs, down	from	6.2% in FY 1973). The dod	total	included $8.7 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (rdt&e), a $600 million increase over FY 1973. Of the requested rdt&e total, military astronautics—with major programs including military comsats, the first spaceborne ballistic missile early warning system, a prototype satellite to demonstrate precise navigation capabilities, continued flight experiment programs, and technology programs in advanced navigation, guidance, sensors, cooling, reentry, and propulsion—would receive $604.6 million (up $169.9 million). Military sciences would receive $509.8 million (up $13.7 million). Aircraft rdt&e would receive $1,787 billion (down $86 million), and missiles rdt&e $2,245 billion (up $143 million). Major DOD increases were programmed for the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile system ($1,712 billion, up $917 million), new Air Force F—4J jet fighter aircraft ($131 million), CVN-70 aircraft carrier ($657 million, up $358 million) and F-15 air superiority fighter ($1,148 billion, up $240 million). Decreases of $198 million in funding for the Safeguard antiballistic missile system, $208 million for the Poseidon missile, and $64 million for the short-range attack missile (sram) reflected a modernization program, as dod continued the transition from combat support in Southeast Asia to strengthening baseline forces. The Dept, of Transportation budget request of $9,025 billion was a decrease of $2,302 billion from FY 1973. dot funding would continue a 10-yr, $10-billion program to improve urban mass transportation and reduce highway congestion. Federal Aviation Administration funding of $2,126 billion would continue efforts to reduce aircraft noise, ensure that advanced aircraft engines did not adversely affect the upper atmosphere, and design a safer and more productive airport system. The Atomic Energy Commission FY 1974 budget request of $3,066 billion, up $382 million over FY 1973, would cover production of nuclear materials to make electricity and for use in nuclear weapons and as nuclear reactor fuel, research into availability of source materials, operation safety, and development of techniques for long-term storage of radioactive waste. The National Science Foundation FY 1974 budget request of $582.6 million was down $63.1 million from FY 1973, but r&d funding would increase from $510.3 million in FY 1973 to $554.1 million. Programs would emphasize research into domestic problems, problems of long-range national interest, and effects of R&D on the economy. Priorities would include development of solar power as an energy source and of tunneling technology for urban use under the Research Applied to National Needs (rann) program and development of a very-large-array radioastronomy facility. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (in the Dept, of Commerce) budget request of $343.0 million, down from $366.7 million in FY 1973, would permit continued improvements in weather monitoring, prediction, and warning; continuation of its polar orbiting satellite system and implementation of a two-geostationary satellite system in the weather satellite program; major hurricane modification research; and expansion of research on marine ecosystems analysis to determine effects of ocean dumping. The Environmental Protection Agency budget request of $148.7 million was down from $173.1 million in FY 1973.

l/c Eduard Burchard, West German Air Force medical officer, had begun two-year tour of duty with the Flight Medicine Section of Johnson Space Center, jsc announced. Burchard would work with U.S. scientists on Skylab. (jsc Release 73-26) March 14:	Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, cited examples of space technology spinoff in testimony before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1974 authorization hearings: A heat recovery system developed from an improved means for eliminating thermal gradients in spacecraft would soon be available for use as a home unit that would provide adequate warm air and hot water from a single flame source. A fast-scan infrared camera adapted from Marshall Space Flight Center research would project 60 frames per second, giving “the same flicker-free image you receive on your TV set.” An irreversible warm-up indicator adapted from NASA-sponsored low-temperature balloon battery research could warn when frozen food had been exposed to too high a temperature. A low-cost portable drug detector developed under Ames Research Center auspices would detect drugs in urine in microscopic amounts. ARC had cooperated with the NASA-sponsored Biochemical Application Team at Stanford Univ. to develop a consumable pill to telemeter body temperature to a remote display unit. The pill could determine the location of ulcers or tumors within the intestines. The need to monitor astronauts’ sleep had led to the development of a sleep analyzer—a soft electrode cap—that required no scalp preparation for good electrode contact. The NASA-sponsored Biomedical Team at Southwest Research Institute had helped make Temper Foam available for prevention of bedsores and as an impact-absorbing material for artificial limbs. The foam had been developed under arc contract. (Transcript)
nasa efforts to study Comet Kohoutek [see June 21—23] were described in a Science article. NASA had established a special task force to help prepare for infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations from spacecraft, aircraft, and ground. Oao 3 Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (launched Aug. 21, 1972) would observe Kohoutek in the months before and after its closest approach to the sun about Dec. 29, when Kohoutek was expected to be as bright as a full moon. During the passage near the sun, Oso 7 Orbiting Solar Observatory (launched Sept. 29, 1971), various sounding rockets, and possibly the Skylab Orbital Workshop (launched May 14) would be trained on the comet, which astronomers believed might be insulated from the rest of the solar system.

Marshall Space Flight Center issued a request for proposals for space shuttle solid-fueled rocket motor (srm) development to Aerojet Solid Propulsion Co., Lockheed Propulsion Co., Thiokol Chemical Corp., and United Technology Center. Technical proposals were due Aug. 27 and cost proposals Aug. 30. The program would include increments for design, development, and test (including production of sufficient hardware for six development flights) ; for production of new and refurbished SRMs for 54 flights; and for delivery of new and refurbished units for 385 flights., (nasa Release 73-133)
Langley Research Center scientists had redesigned a Cessna Cardinal aircraft with a smaller, experimental wing in a research program to apply advanced aerodynamic technology to small general-aviation aircraft, NASA announced. Renamed the Redhawk, the experimental aircraft had been flown across the U.S. and operated by aviation writers and pilots from general-aviation companies. LaRC research pilots had praised the aircraft’s low response to air turbulence and the control made possible by spoilers and flap systems on the wings. In the program’s second phase, a Piper twin-engine Seneca aircraft was being converted to study a new airfoil section developed by Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb, Jr., Head of the 8-Foot Tunnels Branch at LaRC. (nasa Release 73-197)
NASA released details of Langley Research Center’s planned program to heat and cool a 5000-sq-m (53 000-sq-ft) Systems Engineering Building by solar energy. The program had been announced by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in Nov. 13 testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Energy. The program was to obtain realistic engineering and operating experience with a source of clean power as an alternate to fossil fuels and other conventional energy sources. Planned for mid-1975 completion, the building—believed to be first of its size for which solar energy would provide a significant part of its heating and cooling system—would use a 1400-sq-m (15 000-sq-ft) solar collector to provide most of the heating and some of the cooling requirements. It also would test energy-storage capacity. NASA believed the solar collector to be the pacing component in the system and had established heating and cooling cost goals of $1 to $2 per 0.09 sq m (1 sq ft) over a 15-yr life span, (nasa Release 73-282)
President Nixon announced the designation of Robert D. Timm Chairman of Civil Aeronautics Board, effective March 2. He would succeed retiring Secor D. Browne. The President also accepted the resignation of the first NASA Administrator, Dr. T. Keith Glennan, as U.S. Representative to International Atomic Energy Agency. He submitted to the Senate the nomination of Alexander P. Butterfield to be Federal Aviation Administrator. (PD, 2/26/73, 189, 244; 3/5/73, 192) February 26-March 3: The nasa and Soviet Academy of Sciences Joint Working Group on Space Biology and Medicine met in Moscow to exchange information on preliminary biomedical results of the Apollo 17 mission (Dec. 7—9, 1972) and Soviet research in weightlessness modeling. The Group agreed on common procedures to test body negative pressure, to make active orthostatic evaluations, and to make biochemical blood and urine studies, permitting comparison of pre- and postflight data on body functions. The Group also discussed biological experiments in space and countermeasures to weightlessness. The U.S. delegation—headed by Dr. Charles A. Berry, NASA Director of Life Sciences— visited Soviet medical research facilities and the Gagarin Center for Cosmonaut Training. They examined spacecraft trainers, medical equipment used for cosmonaut training and evaluation, and medical instrumentation used on Salyut spacecraft. The Soviet delegation was headed by Dr. R. N. Gurovsky. The next meeting would be held in the U.S. in late 1973 or early 1974. (nasa Release 73-79) February 27:	The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight began hearings on H.R. 4567, House version of the $3.016-billion NASA FY 1974 authorization bill. Dale D. Myers, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said the “historic accomplishments of the Apollo program” were “an open record and an enduring tribute to a basic belief in human progress. The Apollo flights, in three short years, gave us an order of magnitude increase in our knowledge of the solar system. Although the epic Apollo voyages have ended, the results of these missions will provide the scientific, the technical, and medical, and the managerial communities with a rich store of data that will be studied and analyzed for many years to come.” NASA had completed the Apollo program and “moved from the era of learning how to live and work in space to a new plateau, where this Nation can utilize space and its unique capabilities for expanding its horizons in science and in applications, in defense, commercial activities and in international cooperation at reduced costs.” Skylab—scheduled for May launch—would be the “first post-Apollo step into the intensive utilization of space” and toward reorienting manned space activities to earth orbit. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp) , scheduled for July 1975 launch, would be “a major step forward in meaningful and beneficial international cooperation in manned space flight” and a significant step in space safety and in reducing costs by cooperation. Later, the space shuttle would provide “ample additional opportunities for meaningful technical and economic cooperation in space.” One opportunity would be to carry sortie, lab being developed by group of European nations using their own funds. Closing out of Apollo activity would include “very careful screening of available production tooling for applicability to future shuttle or other NASA requirements.” Available flight articles included two Saturn V and two Saturn IB launch vehicles, one completed command and service module, two partially assembled csms, and a backup Skylab cluster. This hardware would he placed in storage for potential use. (Transcript)
NASA planned to spend up to $100 million during the next five years on the post-Apollo lunar science program to extract information from 385 kg (850 lbs) of lunar samples, 30 000 photos, and “miles” of magnetic tape from six Apollo lunar landing missions, the New York Times reported. Director Anthony J. Calio of Manned Spacecraft Center Office of Science and Applications had said in an interview that recommendations in an October 1972 report of the Lunar Science Institute were being followed in much of msc’s planning, but the msc Lunar Receiving Laboratory would be closed on completion of Apollo 17 sample processing. The sample collection might be divided for storage at another Government facility as a “precaution.” The lrl report had said preservation of MSC curatorial facilities for lunar materials was “absolutely essential” to lunar science objectives. Calio said sample inventory and preparation of rock slivers for the thin sections library should take two years. Repository for Apollo geophysical material, including magnetic tapes, probably would be Goddard Space Flight Center. (Wilford, NYT, 1/3/73, 25)
Johnson Space Center announced it would issue a $ 1.2-million costplusfixed-fee supplemental agreement to an existing Skylab Payload Integration contract with Martin Marietta Corp. Denver Div.

It would be “easy flying for the new Air Force bomber, the B-l, during the 93rd Congress,” the Congressional Quarterly predicted. The FY 1974 Air Force request for $473.5 million to complete construction of the first prototype “probably will pass with relative ease.” The prototype was scheduled for rollout at the Rockwell International Corp. factory in January 1974, with the first test flight scheduled for April. Two additional prototypes would be built to test the aircraft’s structure and avionics, with test flights in January and April 1975. Final cost of the three aircraft would be $2.7 billion. B-l supporters had said the real battle would come when Congress had to decide whether to begin mass production. (CQ, 6/16/73)
Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of Johnson Space Center’s Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., died in Houston at age 43. He had contracted a fatal illness in 1971. Dr. Gast had been on leave from Columbia Univ.’s Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and, since 1970, had directed the lunar science team studying lunar samples at JSC. He had received the NASA Medal for Exceptional Service in 1970 and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1972. He had been awarded the first Victor Goldschmidt Award of the Geochemical Society in 1972 and had been named to receive the James Furman Kemp Medal of Columbia Univ. in 1973 for directing the lunar rock study. (NYT, 5/18/73, 34; SF, 10/73, 389) May 18:	Newspapers commented on the Skylab 1 mission as engineers at Johnson Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center prepared sunshades to cool down the overheated space station: New York Times: The “partial recovery from earlier disaster has set the stage for an unprecedented improvisation in space. Present plans are for the Skylab crew to blast off a week from today and install a sunshade or awning to replace the missing thermal shield. If that can be done, the temperature problem will be solved and the astronauts will be able to begin living in the space station and to carry out at least some of the projected experiments. All these plans transcend past space feats, and if successful, will mark a major advance in the nation’s space capabilities. But the task will not be easy and a happy ending is by no means guaranteed.” (NYT, 5/18/73, 32) Chicago Daily News: “The space station experiments not only look outward toward the sun and stars, but also down at the Earth. From 270 miles [435 kilometers] up, men can learn much about the planet, its resources and its weather that they can’t see on the ground. Much of the knowledge gained from Skylab can be expected to have practical application toward improving the quality of life on Earth.” (C Daily News, 5/18/73)
The Brevard County, Fla., Department of Civil Defense had obtained a 1-million-gal water tank valued at $60 000 from Kennedy Space Center under a Federal program which offered excess Government equipment to state, county, and local government agencies free of cost, KSC announced.

“I am aware of the need to maintain a strong, independent position as Science Adviser. I do not believe there will be insurmountable difficulties in dealing with this challenge. The newly established Science and Technology Policy Office will be the strong staff arm to help me carry out these new duties.......I have structured this office to maintain a maximum degree of objectivity and impartiality on science policy matters. ... I intend to call upon the significant and broad capabilities existent within the Foundation. ... I will also call upon other Government agencies for assistance whenever appropriate.” Dr. Edward E. David, Jr., Executive Vice President for Research and Development and Planning with Gould, Inc., and former Presidential Science Adviser, on July 24 commented on nsf’s new role as “the Government’s highest level policy and advisory body with technical competence.” He saw the new arrangement at nsf as unstable, with “formidable and demanding” tasks. He saw two possible resolutions: NSF could restrict itself to science and academic research or it could transcend its historic past and achieve the national stature necessary to influence agencies and departments on technical programs that cut across operating boundaries and to serve as the technological beacon for other agencies. Science, Dr. David said, had not been downgraded. “Science and technology will continue to-be the warp and woof of our society,” but the national scene had changed. The former White House apparatus, 1957—1965, had been “more weighted toward space and military matters. Importantly, the apparatus was also responsible for development of programs to strengthen the infrastructure of science and engineering. ... In recent years we have seen the emphasis shifting toward consumer and public-oriented technologies in energy, transportation, health, education, natural resources, ecology and environment, and social systems. This shift brings with it a powerful new set of policy issues which illustrate the necessity to include not only science and technology, but also economic, social, legal, and political factors”—consumer markets, public preferences, and political beliefs, “matters with which the Federal establishment has little experience or expertise. It is in such matters that the new NSF office must exert leadership and influence.” (Transcript) July 18:	RCA Corp. announced that its subsidiaries RCA Global Communications, Inc., and RCA Alaska Communications, Inc., had signed a $3 750 000 contract with McDonnell Douglas Corp. to develop an uprated Thor-Delta launch vehicle to launch domestic satellites.

Reaction of writers Norman Mailer and Katherine Anne Porter to space flight and to nighttime launch of Apollo 17 were reported in the Christian Science Monitor. Authors had witnessed the Dec. 6, 1972, launch and participated in a space seminar during the “Voyage beyond Apollo” cruise of the S.S. Statendam, which left New York Dec. 4 for Cape Kennedy and the Caribbean. Mailer had said: “Moon colonies offer the possibility that we’ll be able to discover definitively and for the first time what we are doing wrong. Whether we thrive on the moon or fail we’re going to learn something that we’re not going to learn by staying here on earth. . . .” Part of “the fundamental impasse of 20th-century man and woman is that they cannot find communities which express their philosophical ideas, their social ideas, and their private ideas. In other words, the one thing that we can’t do any longer is verify what we think. We can have ideas. But we spend our lives just talking about them. “There are very few people who have a profound sense of commitment. One of the reasons that the astronauts have been so revered . . . is that they have this huge sense of commitment. . . . they are absolutely devoted to a living a life that they believe in utterly and are willing to go through great hardship for it. I think that until our society reaches the point where many more people live lives of such commitment it’s going to remain essentially unhealthy. . . . “The decision to go to the moon is such a declaration of intent. If nothing else, one has to risk dying on it. One has to recognize that one is taking a major step, and the idea of taking a major step brings out in, people at least for a short period . . . the best in them. Then, if there’s something really alive in the venture, they’re likely to keep changing their habits and go on to make more of themselves.” Miss Porter had said that, in almost anything men undertook together here on the earth, “in no time at all there’s a pull and haul for power. They’re betraying and tricking each other, getting in one another’s way. And yet when it comes to something they consider big enough and grand enough they do it in a grand way and they do it well, like the astronauts. . . . We’ve always built and saved a little more than we’ve been able to destroy, don’t you think?” (CSM, 1/3/73)

NASA launched two Areas sounding rockets from Antigua, West Indies, carrying Goddard Space Flight Center experiments to measure ozone distribution in the upper atmosphere, monitor anomalous ultraviolet absorption, and extend the data base for a climatology of stratospheric ozone in the tropics. Both launches were in conjunction with a Nimbus 4 satellite (launched April 8, 1970) overpass. The first Areas reached a 52.7-km (32.7-mi) altitude. Ejection of the payload-parachute unit was accomplished, but the nosecone remained attached to the instrumentation section shielding the sensors from the atmosphere. No data were acquired. The second Areas, launched 80 min later, reached a 51.2-km (31.8-mi) altitude but the payload-parachute unit did not eject and no data were received, (nasa Rpts srl) August 17:	The Air Force launched an unidentified satellite on a ThorBurner II booster from Vandenberg Air Force Base into orbit with an 853-km (530.0-mi) apogee, 808-km (502.1-mi) perigee, 101.5-min period, and 98.8° inclination, (gsfc SSR, 8/30/73; Pres Rpt 74)
A New York Times editorial commented on the cost-benefit ratio of the U.S. Skylab missions. “Is the advantage gained by putting men into space worth the high price that must be paid?” Although bold, imaginative, and potentially useful, Skylab came at a time when Americans were “oppressively aware of the limits of the nation’s resources and of the consequent restraints and constraints on national policy.” Skylab would be most important “in providing practical evidence in determining the relative value of manned activity in utilizing earth’s immediate neighborhood to meet man’s needs on this planet.” (NYT, 5/13/73, 4:14) May 14-Ju.ne 22: The Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop and—11 days later— the Skylab 2 Apollo spacecraft carrying a three-man crew were launched into near-earth orbit to establish the first U.S. manned orbital laboratory, in the four-mission Skylab program. Skylab i’s meteoroid shield was torn off and the solar array system damaged during launch, cutting power and raising temperature to threaten the mission, although the spacecraft achieved satisfactory orbit. Skylab 2, scheduled for May 15 launch, was delayed while damage was assessed and the flight plan modified. On May 25, Skylab 2 carried three astronauts to rendezvous and dock with the earth-orbiting Workshop. The crew boarded the Workshop, repaired spacecraft damage, and conducted medical experiments and studies in solar astronomy and earth resources for a record 28 days before undocking for a safe return to earth June 22. May 14-24:	Skylab 1 (SL-1) was launched on time at 1:30 pm edt from Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39, Pad A, by a two-stage Saturn V launch vehicle after a nominal countdown. Liftoff was witnessed by U.S. and foreign TV viewers and by an estimated 500 000 persons at ICSC, including U.S. and foreign dignitaries and 26 former prisoners of war invited by NASA. The Skylab 2 crew—Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr. (commander), Paul J. Weitz (pilot), and Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin (science pilot)—watched the launch from quarantine. Skylab’s Saturn Workshop (sws) cluster launched toward earth orbit included the Orbital Workshop (ows) with its Apollo Telescope Mount (atm), airlock module (am), multiple docking adapter (mda), and instrument unit (iu). At 63 sec into the mission, indication was received that the meteoroid shield had deployed prematurely. The Workshop was placed in nominal, circular orbit with 438.2-km (272.2-mi) altitude, 93-min period, 50° inclination, and 7649.4-m-per-sec (25 096.6-fps) orbital velocity. The payload shroud was j ettisoned on time at 15 min and 25 sec after launch and the atm deployed at 21 min 34 sec with normal deployment of the ATM solar arrays at 26 min 38 sec, but ground controllers received no indication that the Workshop solar array system (sas), which was to have been released by an onboard computer, had been deployed. At 41 min, a ground command was sent to deploy the two SAS wings. They did not respond. The command was sent again 30 min later and a third time near the end of the first orbit, without result. During the first postlaunch press briefing, Director of Launch Operations Walter J. Kapryan said that if the arrays did not deploy “the mission will be seriously degraded.” The crew was not set up to perform a fix-it-yourself extravehicular activity (eva) and there were no controls for deployment inside the Workshop. Anxious officials and flight controllers began analyzing radioed launch data. Analysis and later inspection revealed that the meteoroid shield had been torn off by vibration of the vehicle just after passing through mach 1 speed, near the time of highest dynamic pressure. Some early measurements indicated that the shield separation straps were still satisfactory, but later measurements indicated failure. The failure had released the securing mechanism on SAS Wing 2 and the wing ripped off. A piece of shield had wrapped around SAS Wing 1 and kept it from deploying. Loss of the wings, which were to provide power to the Workshop, reduced power to 50% of its average 8000-w output; the remaining 50% would he supplied by the four atm solar panels. At 11:00 pm edt Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider announced the Skylab 2 launch had been rescheduled to May 20 to allow assessment of damage and development of a new flight plan to maximize scientific return from Skylab’s experiments with limited power. Fuel cells of the Skylab 2 command and service module (csm) would be used to produce electricity, after joining the Workshop, but the CSM oxygen and hydrogen for the cells would last only 16 to 21 days. It was too early to assess the effect on Skylab 3 and 4 missions, planned for 56 days each. On May 15 Skylab faced a new threat as temperatures inside the Workshop reached above 311 K (100°F). The lost meteoroid shield had also been designed to reflect sunlight and help cool the Workshop. “We think we can live with the electrical power shortage,” Schneider said, “but if we can’t solve this thermal problem we have a serious situation,” Schneider feared foods and film might be spoiled, plastic parts might begin to leak poisonous gases, and the laboratory might become uninhabitable. The entire Skylab team was mobilized—at Johnson Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Martin Marietta Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp., trw Inc., and Garrett AiResearch Co.—in an all-out attempt to overcome the loss of the shield and solar arrays. Schneider said NASA was studying the possibility of the Skylab 2 astronauts’ putting “some kind of a thermal blanket around the spacecraft,” but that would require a delay of the Skylab 2 launch beyond May 20. Astronauts would also inspect the solar wings, but whether they could make repairs was uncertain. The Skylab 2 crew returned to JSC May 15 to help flight planners salvage the mission. Special attitude maneuvers were run to obtain temperature data on the Skylab cluster and to limit Workshop temperatures, as internal temperature soared as high as 325 K (125°F). Temperature was reduced by pitching the Workshop with the longitudinal axis pointed at the sun for one orbit and, on May 16, the Workshop was tilted 55° away from the sun, with sufficient sunlight on the working solar panels to charge the batteries but moving the space station out of the sun’s full glare. Teams continued to compute options to overcome the loss of the shield: astronauts could spray-paint Skylab Vs side to alter radiation properties of the gold foil coating the Workshop shell, could wallpaper the critical area, or could deploy a solar sunshade. Choice of the third option was announced May 16. The astronauts were trained in three possible methods of deploying the sunshade and in procedures to deploy the jammed solar panel. If they failed with the panel, a near-normal 16- to 21-day mission could still be realized by using the CSM power and curtailing some experiments. After that experiments would have to be severely cut back to reserve power for the CSm’s trip home. On May 17 NASA announced postponement of the Skylab 2 launch until May 25 to allow the astronauts to practice techniques for deploying the sunshade and mission engineers to design, fabricate, and test hardware. Astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and Weitz flew to msfc to practice installing the sun shield in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator. On May 20 the Workshop was purged of any gases from the overheated insulation material and turned slightly to allow the sun to warm the airlock module and prevent water stored there from freezing and causing breakage. Components of the astronauts’ repair kit were shipped to MSFC for final testing before being installed in Skylab 2’s Apollo csm. On May 22 the Skylab 2 astronaut crew flew to KSC to prepare for the May 25 launch. Three thermal shields were decided on at a May 23 review: a parasol deployable from the Workshop through the solar scientific airlock, a backup twin-pole shield deployable by the crew during EVA, and a standup-EVA (seva) sail deployable by the crew from the CSM if both other methods failed. The Skylab 2 countdown resumed at 5:30 am edt May 23 at ksc. It had been halted eight hours after Skylab 1 liftoff May 14. On May 24 the three emergency sunshades and necessary tools were stored in the CM. Significant experiments—S015, effects of zero g on single human cells; S020, x-ray/solar photography; T025, coronagraph contamination measurements; M555, gallium arsenide crystal growth; equipment for S063, ultraviolet (uv) airglow horizon photography; and spare equipment for TV coverage of the ATM EVA—were removed to accommodate the additional 180 kg (400 lbs) of equipment. The crew would also carry an extra medical kit to replace medicines spoiled by high temperatures in Skylab 1. Lightning struck the Skylab 2 mobile service structure at 5:24 pm EDT May 24, but retests of the vehicle indicated no damage. At a May 24 press conference Program Director Schneider said there would be limited activity by the crew to deploy the partially opened solar panel. “We’re not too optimistic that we’ll be able to do too much, although we will give Capt. Conrad the option to try it if it looks like a reasonable job.” NASA was “very confident that ... we will be able to deploy a [thermal] shield, we will get the spacecraft temperatures back under control, and we will have a good 28-day mission.” May 25:	Skylab 2 (SL-2) was launched from ICSC Launch Complex 39, Pad B, on a two-stage Saturn IB launch vehicle into heavy dark clouds on time at 9:00 am edt. As Astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and Weitz headed toward the Skylab 1 Workshop they were to attempt to repair in orbit and man for 28 days, Commander Conrad told Mission Control, “We fix anything.” The csm/S-IVB combination was placed in a phasing orbit with 224-km (139.2-mi) apogee and 150-km (93.2-mi) perigee 9 min 56 sec after launch. Six minutes later the csm separated. The S—IVB stage deorbit maneuver was performed at 2:23 pm edt and the stage splashed into the Pacific Ocean. The CSM rendezvoused with the Workshop at 4:30 pm EDT over the Guam tracking station on the fifth orbit. During 15 min of TV coverage the CSM flew around the Workshop, within 1.5 m (5 ft) of it. The astronauts confirmed that the SAS Wing 2 was missing and that the SAS Wing 1, deployed only 15°, was restrained by a piece of the micrometeoroid shield wrapped around the SAS beam fairing. Portions of the gold foil laminated to the Workshop skin for thermal protection had been torn and heat and uv radiation from the sun had scorched the skin. The astronauts soft-docked the CSM with the Workshop, using only three capture latches; ate dinner; and undocked to attempt to deploy the jammed solar panel. Weitz stood in the open hatch of the CSM with Kerwin holding his knees to keep him from drifting into space. He tried to free the solar panel with a shepherd’s crook and a pole with pruning shears attached without success. Conrad told Mission Control that the panel appeared to be “hooked in there like it’s nailed on.” The repair attempt was ended at 8:12 pm edt. The crew made four unsuccessful attempts to redock with the Workshop. Working in bulky spacesuits and gloves, the astronauts evacuated the air from the Apollo cabin and hooked up an electric cable to override a suspected short in the docking probe. “Yea. We got a hard dock out of it [a docking using all 12 sealing latches to seal the two spacecraft together],” Conrad said at 11:50 pm edt. The crew found one of the capture latches had stuck in the retracted position, but troubleshooting procedures recommended by Mission Control restored the latch. May 26-June 21:	The Skylab 2 crew entered the multiple docking adapter on the Skylab Workshop at 12:45 pm edt May 26 and performed activation and Workshop preentry tasks. A chemical detection device inserted into the passage indicated no lethal gas was present. At 2:30 pm edt Astronaut Weitz entered the Workshop wearing a gas mask, gloves, and soft shoes to protect him from the heat. Weitz told ground control, “The ows appears to be in good shape. It feels a little bit warm as you might expect, like 90 to 100 degrees [F; 305 to 310 K] in the desert. I felt heat radiating from everywhere but I never felt uncomfortable. And nothing I touched felt hot to me. It’s a dry heat.” Kerwin and Conrad followed Weitz. After a quick inspection, the crew closed the hatch. At 4:30 pm edt the crew began to deploy the solar parasol—a mylar shade folded against a telescopic pole—through the solar airlock. As they readied the parasol, the astronauts looked out of the windows and identified landmarks across the U.S. Weitz recognized Seattle, Wash., and Conrad spotted both launch pads used for the Skylab launches at Conrad and Weitz popped open the shiny aluminum and orange canopy at 8:30 pm edt May 26 (Mission Day 2) while Kerwin took TV photos from the attached Apollo cm. Significant external temperature decreases were noted almost immediately after deployment. Internal temperatures decreased more slowly. The Workshop was headed back to solar inertial attitude. By May 27 the Workshop temperature had dropped to 309 K (97°F). The crew activated systems and experiments while their back-and-forth excursions through the Workshop were televised to the earth. The Washington Post later said they resembled “skin divers snorkeling through a cave in the Caribbean” or a scene from the film “2001” with astronauts “in orange flight suits and white T-shirts swimming like fish through the big workshop, floating backwards and tumbling like gymnasts.” On May 28 the astronauts began the first medical tests, taking and processing blood samples and checking the conditions of their circulatory and metabolic systems. Checkout and preparation of the (atm) was begun. During a seven-minute televised space-to-ground news conference beginning at 1:09 pm edt, Conrad said the crew had adapted rapidly. “None of us has had any motion sickness. ... It seems to be like the simulator except with the absence of gravity.” Kerwin concluded that the brain and eyes must override the body’s vestibule system in the inner ear. “You say to your brain, ‘Brain, I want that way to be up.’ And your brain says, ‘OK, then that way is up.’ . . . Your brain will follow you.” Conrad agreed, “We’re in good shape for 28 days.” Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, jsc Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, said later in the mission that it was “rather amazing” that the crew had shown no signs of the expected motion sickness. Data received were preliminary, but prelaunch exercises in a whirling chair might have helped avoid nausea. Temperatures continued to drop slowly, reaching 304 K (88°F). At 8:50 pm edt a 69-sec trim burn put the Workshop into a repeating ground track about 96 km (60 mi) west of normal, to acquire earth resources data. On May 29 checkout of the ATM was completed and four passes were made. Kerwin trained an array of telescopes to observe x-ray emissions and examine the structure of the sun’s atmosphere. He photographed three regions of the sun considered active by solar physicists and made detailed observations of the full solar disk and the corona. Conrad and Weitz prepared the earth-oriented cameras for earth resources experiment package (erep) passes. Two biomedical runs were made. During a private conversation with jsc, Conrad reported that the internal temperature had stabilized near 304 K (88°F) and that, while this would be tolerable for the rest of the mission, he did not think the crew could carry out the full protocol on the bicycle ergometer (exercise device). On May 30 the solar telescopes were aimed at the active regions of the sun while scientists on the earth received excellent TV photos of the solar corona and the solar disk in the uv spectrum. The first erep photo pass was made over a 3200-km (2000-mi) strip from Oregon to the Gulf of Mexico. Good pictures were obtained of the Great Salt Lake, gypsum beds in New Mexico, and the soil salinity of the Rio Grande Valley, as well as microwave measurements of the Gulf of Mexico. After the erep pass, the batteries—at a reduced level of 45% to 50% capacity—tripped off line and ceased to produce electricity. They had been designed to trip off at 20% capacity. One battery also lost the regulator that allowed the solar panel to recharge it, decreasing the total Workshop power by 6%, or 250 w, leaving 4200 w. The Workshop required 3600 w for maintenance, leaving only 600 w for experiments. The second erep pass was canceled for a power evaluation. Sixteen batteries were brought back on line but two remained off line and were useless. Heat, fans, and lights were powered down. Workshop power continued reduced May 31 and erep experiments were canceled. The crew continued medical experiments, each taking a turn in a rotating chair to provide data on motion sickness and maintaining balance in zero g. Weitz repaired the mirror system on the uv stellar photography experiment. Temperatures had dropped to 301 K (82°F). The Skylab astronauts took their first day off June 1 (Mission Day 8) and their first shower in space. On a 15-min color telecast they performed housekeeping chores and—to the music from the film “2001”— did handstands, somersaults, and cartwheels in the zero-g atmosphere. Conrad led the crew in a run around the watertanks. Centrifugal force overcame weightlessness, so the men could keep their feet on the track. On the ground Skylab officials announced the decision to make a second attempt to free the jammed solar panel, while engineers and the backup astronauts, led by Russell L. Schweickart, tested EVA procedures. On June 2, Conrad and Weitz made a 10-min erep photo pass from California to Central Mexico to gather data on earthquakes, volcanoes, pollution sources, mineral resources, and land-use patterns. On the ground Schweickart successfully tested three ways of freeing the jammed solar panel using a bolt cutter, a prying rod, and a surgeon’s bone saw. The astronauts completed the third erep pass over North America and the fifth ATM pass on June 3. The nuclear emulsion experiment, the transuranic cosmic ray detector, and the neutron analysis detector were deployed. Astronaut Conrad set a new world record for time in space at 1:17 am EDT, surpassing the 715-hr 5-min mark set by Astronaut James A. Lovell, Jr. The first ball game in space was held in the Workshop. Conrad said a ball thrown in weightlessness “goes straight as an arrow.” The fourth erep pass was made June 4, as well as five hours of atm solar viewing. Dr. John Zeiglschmid, Skylab Flight Surgeon, told a JSC press briefing that the physical condition of the Skylab crew was excellent. They were consuming the proper amount of food and getting adequate rest. Conrad and Kerwin had lost only 0.5 kg (1 lb) ; Weitz had lost 1.8 kg (4 lbs). Top Skylab officials at msfc agreed that solar wing deployment techniques developed by Astronaut Schweickart were feasible, without unusual safety hazards. On June 6 preparations were made for the next day’s EVA. Conrad said, “I guess we have a fifty-fifty chance of pulling it off.” The 16 Workshop batteries were producing 4200 w—only 600 w more than the minimum necessary for the astronauts’ survival. One battery was down to half charge and others were believed to have been damaged by the heat. The astronauts photographed hurricane Ava during an erep pass, made an atm pass, and photographed uv spectra of stars. Conrad and Kerwin opened the am eva hatch at 11:23 am edt June 7 and extended their umbilicals and a rigged-up 7.6-m (25-ft) pole fitted with cutters for releasing the jammed solar wing, as Weitz took TV photos from the Skylab and the csm. Outsid Kerwin had difficulty keeping a firm footing, with only makeshift andholds and foot restraints, as he secured the end of the pole to antenna mount. His heart rate rose to 150 beats per minute and he \s burning energy at 2000 to 2500 BTUs an hour. Finally he extended the pole to the beam holding the wing and—with Conrad repeatedly telling him to “take it easy” and “cool it”—managed after several tries to fit the cutters around the small bolt that restrained the wing. Conrad moved hand over hand along the pole to the wing. Tangling of the 10.6- and 18.3-m (35- and 60-ft) flexible umbilicals linking the astronauts to spacecraft life support systems complicated their movements. Kerwin pulled a lanyard to snap the cutters and sever the bolt and then extended the wing using a rope attached to the upper surface. Conrad pulled a rope to break a frozen actuator. Two of the sections making up the wing were 40% deployed and the other about 30%. The two astronauts also changed a film magazine in a telescope camera and latched open a balky door on an x-ray telescope before reentering the Workshop and closing the am eva hatch at 2:53 pm edt, concluding 3 hrs 30 min successful eva. The Workshop was pitched up to expose the panels to more direct sunlight and unfreeze the hydraulic system that deployed them. After a few hours one section was 90% deployed, another 40%, and the third 29%. By the next day the sections were fully deployed. Additional electric power of 3000 w was obtained and all eight batteries supplied by the solar panels were charged and in good working order—paving the way for a full Skylab mission. From Mission Control Schweickart said, “Everybody’s shaking hands down here and we just wish we could reach up and shake yours.” President Nixon sent a message: “On behalf of the American people I congratulate and commend you and your crew on your successful effort to repair the world’s first true space station. In the two weeks since you left earth, you have more than fulfilled the prophecy of your parting words, ‘We can fix anything.’ All of us now have new courage that man can work in space to control his environment, improve his circumstances and exert his will even as he does on earth.” On June 12 the ninth erep pass was made. Weitz said he could see pollution flowing into Lake Erie and he couldn’t find Washington, D.C., because of haze. Conrad melted an aluminum alloy to study the behavior of molten metal in weightlessness and used an electron beam for welding inside a small vacuum chamber. On June 13 Dr. Hawkins told a JSC medical review that Kerwin and Weitz were no longer able to perform at preflight levels on the bicycle ergometer, indicating their cardiovascular systems had been weakened by weightlessness. The condition was not at dangerous levels and was not interfering with their normal day-to-day performance. Weitz photographed a massive explosion on the sun with the atm solar telescopes June 15. The flare had erupted from the center of the sun’s side facing the earth and covered an area 40 200 km (25 000 mi) wide. Conrad checked out the Apollo CSM for the return trip to earth, while Kerwin initiated the growth of bacteria in a culture medium and photographed its behavior in the space environment. On June 17 a trim burn corrected a cross-track error and positioned the vehicle for the start of the Skylab 3 mission. President Nixon telephoned the astronauts from Key Biscayne, Fla.: “I guess the way I could summarize this project is that it proves that man still matters. With all the technical machines . . . that you had to work with, it proved that when there were difficulties the ingenuity of men in space was what really mattered, and you have made us all very proud with the way you handled some difficult problems in this project.” The President invited the three Skylab astronauts to visit him at San Clemente, Calif., after splashdown. At 3:22 am edt June 18 (MD—25) astronauts Conrad, Kerwin, and Weitz surpassed the previous space endurance record held by the Soyuz 11 cosmonauts (launched June 6, 1971). Conrad asked that a message be relayed to Soviet cosmonauts giving “our respects at this point in our flight to them and their comrades. Wish them good luck from us in the future.” EVA-2 began at 6:53 am edt June 19. Conrad and Weitz moved through space to retrieve and replace the atm film cassettes while Kerwin photographed the eva for TV from inside the Workshop. Conrad also freed a stuck relay by striking it with a hammer. One of two dead batteries began charging immediately. From the ground Schweickart said, “It worked. Thank you very much, gentlemen. You’ve done it again.” The cameras for the white light coronagraph and x-ray spectroheliographic experiments were replaced by the astronauts to permit photography during the unmanned period between Skylab 2 and 3. eva operations ended at 8:29 am edt, after 1 hr 36 min. During a June 20 press conference from space Kerwin said the astronauts’ physical condition was “a pleasant big surprise. I’m tremendously encouraged about the future of long-duration flight.” June 22:	The astronauts undocked the csm from the Skylab Workshop at 4:55 am edt on Mission Day 29. As the csm pulled away and circled the Workshop, TV and photographic coverage were obtained by the crew, cm separation from the sm at 5:40 am edt was followed by initial service propulsion system firing at 6:05 am edt and a final deorbit maneuver at 9:11 am edt. The cm splashed down at 9:50 am edt 1340 km (830 mi) southwest of San Diego. A recovery helicopter dropped swimmers who installed a flotation collar and a sea anchor. The recovery ship Ticonderoga was maneuvered beside the CM and a crane lifted it aboard with the astronauts inside. Medical examinations on board the recovery ship found some dizziness and ill effects from weightlessness. The crew would travel by ship to San Diego and by air to Ellington Air Force Base, Tex., June 24. The Skylab 1-2 mission achieved its primary objectives of establishing the Skylab Orbital Assembly in earth orbit, obtaining medical data on the crew for use in extending the duration of manned space flight, and performing inflight experiments. It contributed significantly toward program objectives of determining man’s ability to live and work in space for extended periods, extending the science of solar astronomy beyond the limits of earth-based observations, and developing improved techniques for surveying earth resources from space. Despite mission anomalies, 80% of the solar data planned was obtained; 12 of the 15 earth resources data runs were accomplished; all 16 medical experiments were conducted as required and a time history of man’s adaptations to zero-g environment was obtained for the first time; and data were taken on all 43 experiments scheduled for Skylab 2 except those precluded by the use of the solar parasol and weight and power limitations. The performance of the flight crew was good and the mission was judged officially on July 14 to be a success. Major records set to date included the longest-duration manned flight, 28 days 50 min; the longest total time in space for one man, 49 days for Conrad (veteran of Gemini 5 and 11 and Apollo 12 missions) ; the longest inflight EVA, 3 hrs 30 min by Conrad and Kerwin June 7; and the longest distance in orbit for a manned flight, 18 531 559 km (11514 967 mi). Skylab 1-2 was the first U.S. manned orbital workshop. Skylab 3 was scheduled to be launched in August and Skylab 4 in November. The Workshop would be operated unmanned between manned missions. The Skylab program was directed by NASA’s Office of Manned Space Flight, msfc developed and integrated the major program components including the ows, AM, MDA, atm, payload shroud, and most experiments and was responsible for the Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles. KSc managed launch operations. JSC was responsible for flight operations, recovery, crew selection and training, and development of the modified CSM and the spacecraft launch adapter. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under the overall direction of the Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition.

The $5548 fund included individual gifts ranging from $1500 to the $0.35 contribution of an eight-year-old boy sent in 1970 because he had heard that NASA “didn’t have enough money.” A retired Navy chief petty officer had sent one day’s pay after each manned flight in memory of his son who had been killed in the Korean war. A naturalized citizen from Eastern Europe had sent $100 in 1964 because he wished to be a part of the space program that would mean the survival of a free U.S. (nasa Release 73—98)

The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight resumed hearings on the FY 1974 nasa authorization. Dale D. Myers, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, testified that a thorough analysis of the space shuttle’s possible environmental effects had been made in 1972 and a report had been filed with the Environmental Protection Agency. The shuttle’s effect on atmosphere, water, and noise would be “minimal and below allowable limits.” Safeguards to be added would further minimize any potential environmental impact. NASA and Dept, of Defense studies with space-experienced companies to determine the reduction in satellite costs by use of the shuttle for launch and retrieval had shown “payload costs reductions of 40 to 50 percent” from “present-day payload costs.” Plans for FY 1974 called for “an orderly buildup” in prime and subcontractor manpower for the orbiter and space shuttle main engine development and award of contracts for all remaining major elements of the shuttle, including the external tank and solid rocket booster. FY 1974 funds, although less than requested, would provide for “an expanded scope of design, development, and testing activities and for continuation of subsystems and component development.” Director Douglas R. Lord of nasa’s Sortie Lab Task Force testified that the lab would be designed for installation in the space shuttle’s cargo bay “to allow nonastronaut scientists to use nearly conventional laboratory equipment at orbital altitudes.” The lab would consist of a closed, pressurized module for experimenters and their laboratory subsystems and apparatus, as well as a pallet section exposed to space when the payload bay doors were opened, for large sensors requiring space exposure, such as telescopes. The pallet could be used either with the pressurized module or separately, mounted in the payload bay and supported by the shuttle orbiter. The sortie lab would provide “an opportunity for international participation, ... for the first time in the manned program, in the initial development of a completely new capability.” (Transcript)	*
The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight held a hearing on the Skylab 1 Investigation Report [see July 13]. A Senate hearing had been held July 30. Lewis Research Center Director Bruce T. Lundin, Skylab 1 Investigation Board Chairman, testified that the failure to recognize design deficiencies in the Orbital Workshop’s meteoroid shield that led to its loss during the May 14^-June 22 Skylab 1—2 mission and the failure to communicate the importance of proper venting of the shield must be attributed to “an absence of sound engineering judgment and alert engineering leadership . . . over a considerable period of time.” There had been no evidence to indicate that “the design, development and testing of the meteoroid shield were compromised by limitations of funds or time. The quality of workmanship applied to the shield was adequate for its intended purpose.” Testing emphasis on ordnance performance and shield deployment had been appropriate. “Engineering and management personnel on Skylab, on the part of both contractor and Government, were available from the prior Saturn development and were thus highly experienced and adequate in number.” The Investigation Board had suggested corrective action: omit the meteoroid shield on any future Workshops, coat the Workshop for thermal control, and rely on meteoroid protection from the Workshop tank walls. If further protection was required, the Board had favored a fixed, nondeployable shield. To reduce the probability of separation failures as had occurred at Saturn S-II interstage second separation plane, linear-shaped charges should be detonated simultaneously from both ends, and all ordnance applications should be reviewed for a similar failure mode. Structural systems that had to move or deploy, or that required other mechanisms or components for operation, should not be considered solely as structure; and complex, multidisciplinary systems should have a designated project engineer. N0I FILMED NASA Associate Deputy Administrator Willis H. Shapley described nasa’s actions to prevent recurrence of the Skylab Orbital Workshop anomalies: “We established an independent Investigation Board, have accepted the Board’s report, and have directed all our program and project people to examine their projects in light of the findings of the Board. We will follow up to see that changes in formal management systems are made when required.” (Transcript)
The U.S.S.R. had launched three times as many reconnaissance satellites as the U.S. during 1972 but had achieved only 25% more time in orbit because of the expanding U.S. use of long-endurance “Big Bird” spacecraft, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. The U.S.S.R. had obtained 366 days in orbit for its Cosmos satellites; the U.S. total was 295 days. An improved design of U.S.S.R. reconnaissance satellites had been used for 80% of the launches, the magazine said. The new design provided for ejection of hardware—probably a vernier propulsion unit —one or two days before spacecraft recovery. The propulsion unit was used to change the spacecraft orbital path to bring it directly over the ground target. Spacecraft might also be equipped with high-resolution, narrow-field-of-view cameras for a close-look mission. Three of a total eight U.S. launches had been new-generation Big Bird satellites equipped with a giant high-resolution camera, the magazine said. The remaining satellites had been launched by a Titan IIIB-Agena booster, while the number of launches using the Thorad booster had continued to decline. The mission of the Titan IIIB-launched spacecraft was probably changing from mainly close-look to both close-look and search-and-find missions and used as gap fillers for the high-cost Big Birds.

Delegations were led by NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications Leonard Jaffe and Soviet Academician Yu. K. Khodarev. (nasa Release 73-106) February 13:	Pioneer-G, the second Jupiter-mission spacecraft, arrived at Kennedy Space Center in preparation for the opening of the launch window on April 5. If successfully launched with an accurate trajectory in the first few days of window, the spacecraft, designated Pioneer 11, might be programmed to acquire sufficient speed from the Jupiter flyby to continue to Saturn. When the spacecraft reached the Jupiter vicinity in January 1975, Jupiter and Saturn would be nearly aligned. The spacecraft could, under favorable conditions, acquire part of Jupiter’s orbital velocity during the flyby to speed it to Saturn. The predecessor Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972) had been the first spacecraft to undertake an outer planetary mission. It was due to arrive at Jupiter in December 1974. (itsc Release 27-73)

NASA turned off Oao 2 Orbiting Astronomical Observatory at 10:40 pm EST during the 22 000th earth orbit by the spacecraft launched Dec. 7, 1968. Oao 2, designed to operate for one year, had “far exceeded the fondest hopes” of NASA officials by operating more than four years. (NASA prog off; AP, SD Union, 2/14/73)
All three Skylab crews were briefed at Johnson Space Center by Robert A. Citron, Director of the Smithsonian Institution’s Center for Short Lived Phenomena. The Smithsonian was under contract to NASA to report the major daily earth surface phenomena. During the Skylab missions, scheduled to begin May 14 and 15, the reports would be used to advise the crew on suitable targets for hand-held photography and to plan or modify earth resources experiment passes which required a major reorientation of the spacecraft. During the five months of Skylab activities, the crew might expect to see 10 major volcanic eruptions, 5 major cyclonic storms, and 5 earthquakes and 10 floods large enough to cause visible changes in topography. The Center would attempt to send research teams into areas where the Skylab scientists observed unusual changes. (jSC Release 73-47)
The Air Force announced issuance of a $1 358 695, firm-fixed-price contract to McDonnell Douglas Corp. for special tooling for F-4 jet fighter aircraft, (dod Release 20-73) January 10—12:	The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics held its 11th Aerospace Sciences Meeting in Washington, D.C. The Dry-den Research Award winner for 1973, Dr. Herbert Friedman of the Naval Research Laboratory Space Sciences Div., delivered the Dryden Lecture “High Energy Astronomy.” The lecture, which carried $1000 honorarium, had been named in 1967 in honor of the late Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, first nasa Deputy Administrator, who died in 1965. Dr. Friedman said high-energy astronomy was “almost exclusively the subject of space research.” X-ray astronomy to date had revealed about 125 discrete sources and a “diffuse background which spans the energy range from 100 ev to tens of Mev.” X-ray sources revealed included supernova remnants, pulsars, and binary systems in the galaxy. Extragalactic sources included radio galaxies, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. Gamma ray astronomy had shown “no evidence for antimatter within the universe.” (Program; Text) A committee established by aiaa to evaluate NASA’s space shuttle program reported its conclusion that a shuttle system, including both manned and unmanned flight, ought to be built. The committee recommended a research and applications module system with interchangeable modules that could be removed in space to become part of an orbiting laboratory. Other nations should be encouraged to participate in shuttle development, the committee said. (Tech Rev, 5/73, 55) Advanced applications of the shuttle were discussed by J. E. Blahnik of Science Applications, Inc., and D. R. Davis of ITT Research Institute. An exploratory study had concluded that use of the shuttle orbiter for advanced, manned, high-energy missions from low earth orbit should be competitive with other proposed concepts, if orbital and refueling requirements were satisfied by using normal shuttle missions to deliver propellant in addition to their payload. (Program) January 10—13:	The American Astronomical Society met in Las Cruces, N. Mex. Cal Tech astronomer Dr. Robert Howard said six-year observations through the 46-m (150-ft) solar telescope at Mt. Wilson Observatory had shown sections of the sun’s outer atmosphere to be in motion with respect to time. Movements had extended to 259 000 sq km (100 000 sq mi) of photosphere—the sun’s gassy surface—and had appeared to be east-west or west-east. Some motions had been calculated at 6257 km per hr (3888 mph) ; others, at 7300 km per hr (4536 mph). Cause and significance of the motion were unknown. At a press interview Dr. John C. Brandt, chief of the Goddard Space Flight Center Solar Physics Laboratory, said Indians in New Mexico, Arizona, and California nine centuries ago might have recorded a star explosion. Drawings on walls and ceilings of a cave at Chaco Canyon National Monument, N. Mex., closely resembled an explosion of July 4, 1054, as recorded by the Chinese. Similar drawings had been found in Arizona and California. (Alexander, LA Times, 1/11/73; AP, W Post, 1/14/73, A13) January 11:	Cosmos 543 was launched by the U.S.S.R. from Baykonur Cosmodrome into orbit with 309-km (192.0-mi) apogee, 202-km (125.5-mi) perigee, 89.6-min period, and 65.0° inclination. The satellite reentered Jan. 24. (gsfc SSR, 1/31/73; SBD, 1/12/73, 54)
nasa might delay the Skylab 4 launch from October to November so that its crew could observe Comet Kohoutek swing around the sun, Thomas O’Toole in the Washington Post quoted NASA officials as indicating. No firm decision had been made, but most officials favored a delay. NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers had said, “Comets this size come this close to us once in a century. It really looks like the kind of thing you can’t pass up.” (W Post, 1/2A/12>, A12)
The National Science Foundation released Federal Scientific, Technical, and Health Personnel, 1971 (nsf 73—309). In 1971, as in most years since 1966, Federal scientific, technical, and health professional personnel increased little compared with the early 1960s. The Dept, of Defense remained, as in prior years, the largest employer of scientific and technical personnel. About 29% of Federal scientists and engineers performed research and development. The greatest concentration of R&D personnel was at NASA. More than one half of NASA’s scientists and engineers performed R&D activities. Salaries of Federal scientists and engineers increased between 1966 and 1971, largely to meet statutory requirements that they be comparable with non-Federal salaries. Women, accounting for 4% of all Federal scientists and engineers, appeared to be advancing in grade faster than men. (Text) October 1:	NASA’s 15th Anniversary. A National Space Club dinner honored leaders who had implemented the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which established NASA Oct. 1, 1958. Honored guests included Dr. T. Keith Glennan, nasa’s first Administrator, Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, the first man on the moon (July 20, 1969), and Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., the first American in space (aboard Freedom 7, May 5, 1961). NASA’s future role was described by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator: “Unless and until Congress sees fit to change our role, I think NASA should continue to have this one primary mission: to do the necessary research and development in space and aeronautics to identify promising opportunities and meet national needs. In performing this primary mission, we will continue to work closely with user agencies in government and with the aerospace industry.” NASA also was transferring its technology and experience to nonaerospace sectors of the economy and helping other Government agencies solve societal problems. “It so happens that we have the reservoir of technology, and also some available manpower, at a time when the Environmental Protection Agency and other government departments need our help.” NASA had “unique capabilities to help bring into being a pollution-free, resourcesaving hydrogen economy, and to facilitate extensive use of the ultimate energy source, solar power.” NASA’s traditional function as the Nation’s civilian space and aeronautics r&d manager “assures us a challenging and rewarding future during NASA’s next 15 years.” (Program; Prepared text) Anniversary ceremonies also included open house at NASA Centers and annual awards presentations. (NASA Activities, 11/73) During its first 15 yrs NASA had completed 277 major U.S. and international launches, with 210 successful and one still under evaluation. With the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs successfully completed and Skylab progressing, NASA had established 15 768 man-hours in space. Astronauts had spent about 40 hrs in inflight extravehicular activity and more than 90 hrs on the moon. NASA manned spacecraft had spent nearly 400 hrs on the moon and had returned more than 385 kg (850 lbs) of lunar material. Of 38 Americans who had flown in space, 3 had made four space flights, 4 had made three, 10 had made two, and 22 had made one flight each. A dozen astronauts had walked on the moon, and 24 had flown around it. Man had learned he could live and work in space. In unmanned space exploration NASA had launched thousands of sounding rockets carrying U.S. and foreign experiments. Mariner 9 probe (launched May 30, 1971, and still orbiting Mars) had produced 7300 pictures of the planet, showing it to be dynamic and geologically active. Satellites had studied stars beyond the solar system through x-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays. Oao 1 (launched Dec. 7, 1968) and Oao 3 (launched Aug. 21, 1972) had returned a wealth of information on the Milky Way and more distant galaxies. Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972, toward Jupiter) had revolutionized man’s study of the sun. The entire electromagnetic spectrum had been opened to man’s examination by study of stars in ultraviolet and x-ray. Observations from NASA-launched weather satellites had enabled forecasters to observe weather systems from space as they developed and to forecast their effects as they moved into inhabited parts of the world. Man had learned what instruments in space could provide in information about the earth’s resources and their efficient use to facilitate decision making, improve the lot of developing countries, and preserve and improve conditions in countries like the U.S. NASA had provided technological advancements to preserve the U.S. position as world leader in civil and military aeronautics. The joint NASA, Air Force, and Navy X—15 rocket-powered aircraft program had, during 10 yrs of flight, studied effects of hypersonic flight on aircraft skin friction and thermal expansion, pioneered the use of ablative coatings, aided efficient structural design, and served as a workhorse test-bed for nearly 40 experiments. NASA contributions also included the single-pivot variable-sweep wing, which allowed efficient flight at both high and low speeds; supercritical wing and fuselage shapes that permitted an aircraft to cruise at 15% higher speed without increased fuel consumption; and the world’s first digital fly-by-wire control aircraft with a computer-controlled electronic system. The clean combustion program was providing new concepts to reduce pollution from engine exhaust. The aircraft noise-abatement program focused on development of an avionics system, refinement of operational procedures, and the demonstration of two-segment flight paths for quieter landing approaches. The refan program was demonstrating JT8D engine and nacelle modifications to reduce noise of existing jet aircraft. In applications the knowledge gained in 15 yrs was being applied in science, medicine, navigation, communications, agriculture, crime prevention, and commerce. NASA-developed technologies were producing safer buildings, bridges, and aircraft and improved tires, roads, and railbeds. In international cooperation, NASA had conducted 18 cooperative satellite and space probe projects and flown 25 international experiments on its spacecraft. The global system of Intelsat communication satellites comprised 12 satellites launched by NASA. Ahead were completion of Skylab 4, the third and final manned Skylab mission; the July 1975 joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz mission to dock a U.S. and a Soviet spacecraft in space; and the introduction of the revolutionary space shuttle with its European-built Spacelab in the 1980s. In unmanned exploration Mariner 10, scheduled for launch toward Mercury and Venus in early November, was expected to provide the first photos of Mercury. Pioneer 10 was headed for a year-end rendezvous with Jupiter, and Pioneer 11 (launched April 5, 1973) was scheduled for a second reconnaissance of Jupiter in December 1974. Work was proceeding on two Mariner spacecraft for 1977 launch toward Jupiter and Saturn. Major thrusts expected for the 1980s were outlined in a statement released to the press by Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator. NASA would be vigorously developing and demonstrating systems and technologies that would make space activities useful to national and world communities, monitoring the environment and resources, developing electric power from the sun, and using space as a laboratory for new technology and processes. Continued scientific exploration of the earth, space, and the solar system seemed inevitable. And the 1980s might well be a period of preparation for continued manned exploration and exploitation of the solar system, the two-way direct transfer of information between satellites, a long-duration manned space laboratory, automated outer planet orbiters and atmosphere probes, and probably, before the end of the century, a program to establish a manned lunar base for exploration and research, (nasa Release 73-190)
The European Space Research Organization had settled on “Ariane” as the name for the European L-3S launcher, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported, esro previously had selected “Vega,” but some member countries had objected that Vega was a French beer. (Av Wk, 10/29/73, 9) October 29-November 2:	NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration flight-tested a United Air Lines 727 transport aircraft at West Coast airports to evaluate the effects of wing tip vortex trailing during two-segment instrument landing approaches. The tests were part of a continuing NASA and faa study of wing wake vortices, invisible flows of turbulent air streaming from aircraft wing tips in circular or funnel motion. The UAL 727 was flown under contract to Ames Research Center. (nasa Release 73-237)
Some members of Congress were urging a second series of Skylab missions beginning in 1976, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. The purpose would be to avoid the hiatus in manned space exploration between the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975 and the first orbital flight of the space shuttle in 1978. Dr. James Fletcher, NASA Administrator, had estimated the cost of a second Skylab series at less than $1 billion if the same experiments were flown. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-Conn.), would try to add funds for a second Skylab to nasa’s FY 1974 authorization. (Av Wk, 3/12/73, 16)
President Nixon issued Executive Order 11712 establishing a Special Committee on Energy and a National Energy Office in the Executive Office of the President. In a message to Congress on U.S. energy policy, he said: “If we are to be certain that the forward thrust of our economy will not be hampered by insufficient energy supplies or by energy supplies that are prohibitively expensive, then we must not continue to be dependent on conventional forms of energy. We must instead make every useful effort through research and development to provide both alternative sources of energy and new technologies for producing and utilizing this energy. For the short-term future, our . . . strategy will provide technologies to extract and utilize our existing fossil fuels in a manner most compatible with a healthy environment. . . . from 1985 to the beginning of the next century, we will have more sophisticated development of our fossil fuel resources and . . . full development of the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor. Our efforts for the distant future center on the development of technologies—such as rfuclear fusion and solar power—that can provide us with a virtually limitless supply of clean energy.” (PD, 4/23/73, 389-406; 412-3)
The present total electric power demands of the U.S. could be supplied by solar energy plants with a 2000-km (1240-mi) total area, assuming 30% efficiency, Associate Director Walter E. Morrow, Jr., of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory said in a Technology Review article. “This is about 0.03 per cent of the U.S. land area devoted to farming and about 2 per cent of the land area devoted to roads; and it is about equal to the roof area of all the buildings in the U.S.” (Tech Rev, 12/73, 31^3) During 1973: The U.S. put 26 payloads into orbit in 23 launches and the U.S.S.R. orbited 107 payloads in 86 launches. The U.S. total included 13 spacecraft orbited by the Dept, of Defense in 10 launches (2 of them multiple launches) and 13 by nasa. nasa’s 13 successful launches out of 14 attempts nearly matched the agency’s 1972 record of 17 flawless launches out of 17 attempts. NASA’s Skylab program successfully launched the first U.S. experimental space station—the Orbital Workshop—and three successive crews to man it. Skylab 4, the final mission and the longest-duration manned space flight to date (84 days 1 hr 16 min), also set records for man’s cumulative time in space (84 days), duration of extravehicular activity (7 hrs 1 min), cumulative orbital eva time for one mission (22 hrs 21 min), and distance in orbit for a manned mission (55.5 million km; 34.5 million mi). By the year’s end the Workshop had circled the earth more than 3350 times and housed nine astronauts. The Skylab 2 crew’s repair in space of the Skylab 1 Workshop, after aerodynamic forces damaged it during liftoff, salvaged the endangered program and proved man could do difficult construction work in space. The Skylab 2 crew spent 28 days in space and the Skylab 3 crew 59 days, each mission a record at the time. The missions proved man could live and work in space for extended periods; expanded solar astronomy beyond earth-based observations, collecting much valuable new data that might revise understanding of the sun and its effects on the earth; and improved techniques for surveying earth resources from space, returning more information than planned. In NASA’s unmanned program, Pioneer 10 (launched in 1972) swept past Jupiter in December 1973 at a distance of 130 000 km (81 00Q mi). The first spacecraft to fly beyond the orbit of Mars and to penetrate the Asteroid Belt capped its two-year, 826-million-km (514-million-mi) journey by returning more than 300 closeup photos of Jupiter and its inner moons and providing new information on the planet’s atmosphere and magnetic field. By the year’s end Pioneer 10 was beginning its five-year extended mission to reach Saturn’s orbit in 1976 and the orbit of Uranus, the limit of spacecraft communications with the earth, in 1979. Thereafter it was to become the first man-made object to escape the solar system. Pioneer 11, launched in April, had passed safely through three fourths of the Asteroid Belt on its way to its December 1974 encounter with Jupiter. Mariner 10, headed toward Mercury via Venus, was more than 14.5 million km (9 million mi) from the earth; it would pass by Venus in February 1974 and would provide the first closeup view of Mercury in March. NASA also selected landing sites for the Viking project’s landing of two spacecraft on Mars in 1976. Orbiter and lander critical design reviews, spacecraft thermal and structural tests, and other hardware tests were completed during the year. Scientific satellites launched in 1973 included Explorer 49 in lunar orbit to measure galactic and solar radio noise using occultation of the moOn to reduce background interference, Explorer 50 to complete a study of the interplanetary environment over an 11-yr solar cycle, and Explorer 51 to study the earth’s outer atmosphere. As December ended, scientists were studying Comet Kohoutek with optical telescopes, radiotelescopes, and radar from the ground; high-flying aircraft; and instruments on unmanned satellites, sounding rockets, and Skylab 4. Noaa 3, launched by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, would provide atmospheric soundings and very-high-resolution, day-and-night cloud-cover imaging. Two communications satellites, Intelsat-IV F—7 for the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization and Anik 2 Canadian domestic comsat, were successfully launched, as well as Nnss 0—20 Transit navigational satellite for the Navy. Erts 1, launched in mid-1972 as the first Earth Resources Technology Satellite, completed its 7000th photo-taking orbit of the earth, demonstrating the great potential of remote-sensing of the earth’s resources by providing data for use throughout the world. All but one prime contractor for the space shuttle had been selected and design was proceeding on schedule. Most of the shuttle orhiter subcontractors were lined up, with fabrication to begin in FY 1975. Nine nations in the European Space Research Organization agreed to build the Spacelab for a wide variety of applications as a shuttle payload. nasa and dod made joint system studies for the space tug and tentative agreement was reached for DOD to develop an initial tug stage for the shuttle. The first two powered flights of the X—24B lifting body were successfully made in the NASA and Air Force hypersonic aerospacecraft research program. NASA also vigorously pursued solutions to problems of aircraft noise, pollution, safety, and operational efficiency and technology for future-generation aircraft. Flight tests of NASA’s digital fly-by-wire advanced flight control system indicated the system improved handling qualities of aircraft in all flight conditions, with the reduced aircraft weight increasing payload potential and reducing fuel consumption. The JT8D engine refan program progressed to scheduling ground tests for February 1974. The engine modifications—in 727, 737, and DC-9 aircraft, models that made up 60% of the domestic commercial fleet— were expected to reduce areas affected by aircraft noise by 75%. A 67% reduction in 727 aircraft landing noise was anticipated from a two-segment landing procedure being tested in the NASA and Federal Aviation Administration noise abatement program. Automobile engines were used to demonstrate an internal combustion concept for reducing pollution emissions while increasing engine efficiency for general-aviation aircraft. New flight research programs included the remotely piloted research vehicle project in which the pilot flew scale models from a ground-based cockpit, eliminating risk to the test pilot and reducing test-flight costs more than 50%. In NASA’s sounding rocket program, more than 80 flights studied atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomagnetic storms, meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations; male astronomical observations in x-ray, ultraviolet, and radio regions of the electromagnetic spectrum; and supported other programs. Rocket launches provided a reference for calibration of equipment on Skylab’s Apollo Telescope Mount. Forty-nine balloons were flown for scientific research and for development of new technology for long-duration orbital missions. DOD’s year included further development and implementation of satellite communications and navigation systems, development of new military aircraft, and construction of advanced medium STOL prototypes. The U.S.S.R.’s record 86 launches topped 83 in 1971 and 74 in 1972. The 107 Soviet payloads included 85 Cosmos satellites, 2 Intercosmos, I	Luna, 2 Meteor, 1 Prognoz, 1 cooperative Soviet-French Oreol, 2 manned Soyuz, 1 Salyut, 4 Mars probes, and 4 Molniya I and 4 Molniya II	comsats. The Luna 21 probe landed the Lunokhod 2 self-propelled vehicle on the moon for lunar studies. Soyuz 12 carried two cosmonauts into orbit on a two-day mission in September, the first Soviet manned flight since 1971, and Soyuz 13 carried two cosmonauts on an eight-day mission in December. Spacecraft system tests and experiments were reported successful on both flights. (Pres Rpt 1974; NASA Release 73281; NASA Activities, 1/15/74; A&A 1973; gsfc SSR, 12/31/73; gsfc Sounding Rocket Div)
A Detroit News editorial commented on Pioneer 10’s Dec. 3 rendezvous with Jupiter: “Jupiter is lucky. It appears to radiate three times as much energy as it receives from the sun. When all the knowledge Pioneer has transmitted has been absorbed and categorized by NASA scientists, it should provide clues to new energy sources for earth, particularly solar energy and the sun’s rays. All these possibilities are beyond the comprehension of an energy-conscious nation that in four years has grown blase about man walking on the moon. But they open the door for the scientists to apply on earth the potential resources of the solar system.” (D News, 12/5/73) December 9:	A partial lunar eclipse, one of three visible from North America during 1973, shaded 10% of the moon.

Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, nasa Director of Key Personnel and former Director of Manned Spacecraft Center, retired. With NASA since its beginning, Dr. Gilruth had been Director of msc (now Johnson Space Center) from its establishment in November 1961—and through five moon landings of the Apollo program—until he came to Headquarters in January 1972. Earlier he had been at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, predecessor of Langley Research Center, and was appointed Assistant Director in 1952. In 1958 he was assigned to manage the Nation’s first manned space program, NASA’s Project Mercury, as Director of the Space Task Group at Langley, (nasa Personnel Off; nasa Biog; NASA Release 72-11)
The National Science Foundation released Federal Support to Universities, Colleges, and Selected Nonprofit Institutions, Fiscal Year 1971 (nsf 73—300). Total Federal obligations (exclusive of loans) to institutions of higher learning increased in current and constant dollars. Current-dollar volume rose $253 million, or 8%, to a record $3480 million. Constant-dollar increase was 2%, the first increase since 1967. The first 100 universities and colleges in Federal support accounted for more than $2.4 billion during 1971, or 69% of Federal funds to all academic institutions. Private universities and colleges receiving Federal funds outnumbered public institutions receiving Federal funds 1242 to 1126, but public institutions accounted for 61% of total Federal obligations, 65% of degrees awarded, and 75% of students enrolled. In 1971 life sciences research and development funding was $741 million, or 48% of all Federal r&d obligations. Obligations for general support of NSF and National Institutes of Health science programs was $100 million, the same level as in 1970. The Atomic Energy Commission continued as the principal Federal agency funding academically associated r&d centers, with 64% of the $984 million Federal total. NASA and the Dept, of Defense awarded $312 million, or 32% of the total. (Text) During April:	Apollo 17 Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, and Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt concluded the largest and most successful schedule of postflight public appearances undertaken by an astronaut crew. The tour, begun Jan. 12 in Los Angeles, included 57 stops in 25 states and the District of Columbia in 11 weeks. The astronauts met with 12 state governors and addressed state legislatures in Kansas, New Mexico, Georgia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Washington. Activities Bureau Chief Eugene A. Marianetti of NASA’s Public Events Directorate said later that the astronauts had met no evidence of antispace sentiment, “only a lack of adequate information ... on the actual amount spent on the space program.” (NASA Activities, 5/15/73, 89)
nasa held two Skylab 2 press briefings at Johnson Space Center as the astronaut crew, orbiting the earth in the Orbital Workshop launched May 14, carried out experiments and solar photography. At an Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) briefing Dr. Robert Noyes of Harvard College Observatory said the experiment to look into the outer solar atmosphere “exceeds our wildest expectations. Every object that we’ve tried to look at, we’ve done successfully and we have seen . . . entirelynew and different phenomena.” For the first time there had been enough spatial resolution to see the fine structure. Data received by viewing the sun at different heights in the corona had established the existence of two fundamental structures—points of emission 12 900 km (8000 mi) in diameter and a cloud of relatively cool material emersed in the very hot corona. The structures should provide information on heat sources and physical properties of the corona. Dr. Robert Mac-Queen, High Altitude Observatory astronomer, said that a high point of the ATM experiments had been detailed examination of the corona for 45 consecutive hours, identifying the material making up the solar wind passing into the corona. At a solar-flare activity briefing Dr. Guiseppe Vaiana, American Science and Engineering, Inc., scientist and a principal investigator on Skylab, described the TV coverage of the solar flare photographed by Astronaut Paul J. Weitz: “What you are seeing is the great event of the day.” The flare had a double structure in the active region. A portion of it outlined the magnetic field of one polarity on one side and the other polarity on the other side, with a center neutral line. Two bright spots were seen on both sides of the neutral line. The flare extended 100 000 km (62 000 mi) up from the solar surface and covered 21/2 trillion sq km (1 trillion sq mi). It had peaked in intensity 3 min after it had been discovered by Weitz and decayed during the following 30 min. (Transcript)
NASA launched a Nike-Cajun sounding rocket from Kiruna, Sweden, carrying a Goddard Space Flight Center payload to an 88-km (54.7-mi) altitude.

Corliss traced NASA’s Pioneer program from its May 1960 inception through Pioneer 9 (launched Nov. 8, 1968). The program had begun with the launch of early lunar probes Pioneer 1 through 5 by Ames Research Center. Later Pioneers—Pioneer 6 (launched Dec. 16, 1965), Pioneer 7 (launched Aug. 17, 1966), Pioneer 8 (launched Dec. 13, 1967), and Pioneer 9—had been the first spacecraft to orbit the sun systematically at widely separated points in space. They had collected information on space, solar winds, and cosmic radiation of both solar and galactic origin. The Pioneers had been “superbly reliable scientific explorers, sending back information far in excess of their design lifetimes over a period that covers much of the solar cycle.” Vol. II, System Design and Development (SP-279), and Vol. Ill, Operations (SP—280), had been issued in 1972.

Anik 2 was placed in a highly elliptical transfer orbit with a 36 480-km (22 667.6-mi) apogee, 212-km (131.7-mi) perigee, and a 26.7° inclination. After checkout and reorientation of the spacecraft, the apogee motor was fired at 5:00 pm EST April 23, bringing the spacecraft into near synchronous circular orbit with a 35 709-km (22 188.5-mi) apogee, 35 604-km (22123.3-mi) perigee, 1430.7-min period, and 0.1° inclination. The spacecraft was drifting 3° per day toward its final operational position off the west coast of South America. Under NASA-Telesat Canada contract, the NASA mission objective was to place Anik 2 into an orbit of sufficient accuracy to allow the spacecraft propulsion systems to place it in a stationary synchronous orbit while retaining sufficient stationkeeping propulsion to meet the mission lifetime requirements. The objective was met and the mission was adjudged a success April 30. Anik 2—second in a series of Canadian domestic communications satellites—was built by Hughes Aircraft Co. under contract with Telesat Canada and designed to provide transmission of TV, voice, and data throughout Canada for seven years. The spacecraft system provided 12 channels of communications to relay 10 color TV channels or up to 9600 telephone circuits. Two channels would be protection channels for the 10 traffic-carrying channels. The spacecraft was 1.8 m in diameter and 3.4 m high (6 by 11 ft). At launch it weighed 540 kg (1200 lbs) and its orbiting weight was 270 kg (600 lbs). The electronics system was powered by 23 000 solar cells with sufficient onboard battery capacity to maintain service during a sun eclipse of the solar cells. Anik 1 had been launched Nov. 9, 1972. The two-satellite system would act as space repeaters to receive transmissions from earth stations and retransmitt them to earth stations in Canada. A third satellite was retained on the ground as protection against space failure of the first two spacecraft and could be launched in 1975 to expand the system if required. NASA would be reimbursed by Telesat Canada for costs of the Thor-Delta launch vehicle and services. The project was managed for NASA’s Office of Space Sciences by Goddard Space Flight Center, (nasa prog off; nasa Release 73-58; GSFC SSR, 4/30/73) April 20:	Checkouts of the first two Skylab launch vehicles and their spacecraft, in position on Pads A and B of Launch Complex 39 at Kennedy Space Center, continued without major problems.

The Skylab 3 astronauts rested aboard recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans following their splashdown [see July 28—Sept. 25], Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, told the press at Johnson Space Center that their 59-day mission had proved man’s usefulness in earth orbit as the Apollo missions had proved his use of the moon. “In the 15 years since its founding, nasa has successfully placed more than 250 payloads in earth orbit. Of all these, the mission that we completed today will perhaps prove to be the most fruitful of all.” Skylab 3 had proved “how great an advantage it is to have the human mind on the scene to make judgments, to observe, to respond to unexpected developments, and to effect corrective measures. All these were demonstrated on Skylab.” Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said the Skylab 3 astronauts had surpassed their scientific objectives by 150%. “The mission can only be described in superlatives.” (O’Toole, W Post, 9/26/73, 1A; AP, B Sun, 9/26/75)

The National Science Foundation published Continued Growth Planned for Federal Civilian R&D Programs (nsf 73—314). Federal support for civilian research and development had risen 9.1% per year for the past five years. The chief areas of growth were health, transportation and communication, environment, and crime prevention and control. In 1969 civilian-oriented programs had constituted nearly 25%, or $3.6 billion, of a $15.6 billion total; they were expected to form 33.3% of the 1974 $17.4 billion total. National security took up more than 50% of the R&D total each year. In 1974, its growth in R&D obligations was expected to be $478 million, making the national security share of the Federal r&d total 54.2%, higher than any other year since 1969. Space remained the second function in funding size 1969-1974, but reflected the greatest loss in priority. Space r&d obligations showed a steady annual decrease, and the share in the r&d total had declined correspondingly, from 23.9% in 1969 to 14.1% in 1974. From 1973 to 1974, total r&d obligations for space were expected to drop by $234 million, the largest decrease for any function.

Launched March 2, 1972, the spacecraft had completed the 430-million-km (270-million-mi), seven-month trip through the belt with no damaging hits from asteroid particles. Dr. William H. Kinard, Langley Research Center scientist, said NASA was “firmly convinced that the Asteroid belt presents little hazard to future spacecraft going out to explore outer planets.” Pioneer 10 had encountered an average of one large particle of 0.1- to 1-mm (0.004- to 0.04-in) dia a day and had come within 1640 million km (400 million mi) of only one asteroid over 10 m (33 ft) in diameter. Particle encounters had been observed by measuring sunlight scatter of particles by telescopes and by pressurized cells that leaked when penetrated by a particle. Pioneer 10 project scientist Dr. John H. Wolfe of Ames Research Center said the asteroid distribution was fairly uniform. Pioneer 10 had made the most distant observations of solar atmosphere and solar wind to date and had found that the sun’s atmosphere expanded with distance while the solar wind slowed but heated up with distance. The spacecraft had covered 70% of its 1-billion-km (620-million-mi) flight and would reach Jupiter Dec. 3. After exploring Jupiter’s atmosphere it would escape the solar system. Pioneer-G, scheduled for April launch, would travel a similar course to Jupiter. (Transcript; nasa Release 73-27)
NASA activities in solar heating and cooling were summarized by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in testimony before the House Committee on Science and Aeronautics’ Subcommittee on Energy in hearings on H.R. 10952, the Solar Heating and Demonstration Act. Thermal control of spacecraft had been a NASA challenge since the space program’s inception. NASA and its contractors had developed competency in materials, thermal control coatings, heating and cooling technology, and thermal analysis technology which bore directly on the collection and use of solar energy. In the Skylab program Marshall Space Flight Center had developed a thermal coating with unique properties that increased solar collection efficiencies, resulting in higher operating temperatures. The higher temperatures allowed more efficient operation of absorption refrigeration cycles. NASA’s work in solar heating and cooling included advanced research and technology, a residential systems engineering demonstration program, and the planned use of a large new office building as a test bed to obtain realistic engineering and operating experience.

The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight continued hearings on the FY 1974 NASA authorization [see Feb. 27], Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider described progress of the Skylab project at Kennedy Space Center: “The flight hardware has undergone intensive check-out at the module level including docking tests to verify the critical interface between the Multiple Docking Adapter and the Command and Service Module.” Stacking of the Saturn V and Saturn IB launch vehicles “has proceeded apace and end-to-end integrated systems tests of the orbital assembly have been completed.” Activities supported the mid-May dual launch, with rollout to Pad 39B scheduled for mid-April. The Skylab pyramid test program, “starting at the component qualification level and building up through the levels of subsystem and module testing, through acceptance reviews and checkouts, to the countdown demonstration, provides the confidence needed to launch and operate America’s first space station.” Deputy Associate Administrator for Management Harry H. Gorman in the Office of Manned Space Flight discussed the NASA personnel changes brought by completion of the Apollo program. The research, development, and operations contract support effort during the Apollo program had peaked in FY 1968 at 17 500 persons. The FY 1974 budget request would provide employment at a 9500 level—a 45% reduction. The Civil Service staff would decrease by 825 positions in FY 1974, to a total of 10 525. The reduction was also related to completion of Skylab, termination of communications lead center activity, and suspension of the High Energy Astronomy Observatory program. (Transcript)

Visitors included scientists from the U.S.S.R. who presented papers on Apollo lunar samples received from the U.S. At the opening session Dr. George M. Low, nasa Deputy Administrator said, “I can see at least a decade of fruitful analysis, synthesis, and integration of the information locked up in the material brought back and still coming back from the scientific stations left on the moon” in the Apollo program. Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg, California Institute of Technology scientist, described “lunar cataclysm.” Lunar dust brought back by Apollo astronauts had been estimated to be as old as 4.5 billion yrs. But most lunar rocks were less than 4 billion yrs old and none were younger than 3 billion yrs. The best explanation was that 3.9 billion yrs ago the moon was battered and bombarded on an unprecedented scale, creating so much heat that old rocks were destroyed and a new generation of rocks was created. Since then the moon might have experienced minor volcanic eruptions but nothing like that period of cataclysm. Some scientists believed the moon had cooled and gone into a period of hibernation. Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer of the State Univ. of New York said even the orange soil found by Apollo 17 astronauts had turned out to be 3.71 billion yrs old, an age disappointing to scientists who had believed the moon had been formed by more recent volcanic activity. Dr. Keith A. Howard, U.S. Geological Survey geologist, compared the lunar landslide found near the Apollo 17 landing site to a large, high-velocity avalanche on earth. Dr. Howard suggested that gas within the lunar soil had been released during the slide. Apollo 17 samples would be searched for evidence of fluids. One Apollo 17 instrument placed on the lunar surface had made an atom-by-atom search for evidence of lunar atmosphere. Although the moon had no atmosphere, traces of argon, neon, and helium had been found. Dr. John H. Hoffman, associate professor of physics at the Univ. of Texas, said only argon appeared to have been generated from the moon’s interior. Neon and helium apparently had been deposited by the solar wind. Conference attendees unanimously voted to congratulate NASA on completion of the Apollo program by sending a letter to Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator: The conception, design, and implementation of lunar exploration represented “an extraordinary human and technological achievement.” To explore another planet, it had been necessary for man “to achieve many successive levels of technological capability and to surpass formidable barriers. This was accomplished brilliantly by the dedicated engineers and astronauts of NASA in conjunction with skilled management. On this technical base a new branch of science has been built.” (Transcript; Goddard News, 3/73, 2; jsc Roundup, 3/16/73, 1; NASA Activities, 4/15/73, 67) March 5-9:	More than 1000 administrators, congressmen, and government, industry, and university scientists attended the Erts 1 Earth Resources and Technology Satellite Symposium sponsored by Goddard Space Flight Center in New Carrollton, Md. Two hundred papers presented results from Erts 1 (launched July 23, 1972) experiments in agriculture and forestry, mineral resources and geology, environmental surveys, land-use mapping, and marine surveys. Dr. Marian Baumgardner, scientist at the Purdue Univ. Laboratory for the Applications of Remote Sensing, said results from Erts 1 study of semi-arid regions suggested that the satellite could identify and map vegetative, species, and management differences in range lands; gross soil patterns and differences related to agricultural and land-use-management problems and practices; areas of surface water and changes related to ground water recharge; crop damage by hail and windstorms; and areas of bare soil and related problems of erosion and conservation. Dr. William A. Fischer, U.S. Geological Survey scientist, said data from an Erts 1 study of Alaska had reinforced recent plate tectonic theories of a continuing mobility in the earth’s crust. The satellite had mapped fractures previously unknown or not put together as continuous structures in the earth’s crust. The fractures indicated “there has been a fundamental movement, extending deep down into the crust.” Dr. John Miller of the Univ. of Alaska said seismic data and Erts 1 identification of previously unknown fractures “has been an important input to the design of a bridge structure across the Yukon River . . . and possibly the pipeline.” (Transcript)

Joint Commission on Scientific and Technical Cooperation: “What is clear is that after two postponements of the Commission’s debut and a good deal of indecisiveness, at least on the Washington end, concerning how much R&D [research and development] cooperation to offer the Soviets, both parties are approaching the relationship with caution and no evidence of haste. We will no doubt be seeing more Soviet researchers than ever before, and access to labs in the USSR will be eased a bit for American visitors, but the politically inspired match of the two research communities should not be mistaken for a raging love affair.” (Sci & Govt Rpt, 4/1/73, 3)	... April 2:	Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified on nasa’s role in supersonic transport aircraft development before the House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Development-Space-Science-Veterans during FY 1974 appropriation hearings: “I don’t think we can turn our back on supersonic technology. This is a fact of life. Military planes are flying supersonically in this country; ssts are flying in Europe and Russia. We can not just say we don’t want to build a transport ourselves and therefore we should turn off all technology in this area. What we are doing in NASA is trying to address ourselves to the main problems with supersonic flight, both military and civilian. The main problems include the economic factors involved, the pollution of the stratosphere, and the noise.” NASA was the only agency qualified to investigate these problems but “I do think that the Congress has responsibility to determine any future development of a supersonic transport in this country, at least as far as the Government’s support of such a program, and it is not our intention to in any way change that decision.” (Transcript)

Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial praised Soviet aircraft designer Andrey N. Tupolev, who died Dec. 23, 1972: “His warmth, intense and lively professional curiosity and sense of humor did much to open channels of communication between the secrecy-shrouded and isolated Russian aerospace industry and the West.” Until close to his death “he was still the gracious host to foreign technicians at his experimental facility outside Moscow.” Tupolev had “escorted astronaut Neil [A.] Armstrong around his supersonic transport prototype in 1970.” (Hotz, Av Wk, 1/8/73, 9) January 8-10:	The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics held its 9th Annual Meeting and Technical Display in Washington, D.C. Langley Research Center Director Edgar M. Cortright was General Chairman. Lane Director for Space Eugene S. Love delivered 1972 von Karman Lecture, “Advanced Technology and the Space Shuttle.” Lecture discussed shuttle development, need to maintain aggressive advanced research and technology programs independent of near-term needs of major systems, and future transport systems that would blend successful shuttle development technology with nonshuttle technology advancements that could be accomplished within the current decade. Guest speaker Sen. Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-Conn.), criticized Administration budget policies that had affected NASA programs and gone “far beyond the space program.” Policies implied “cutback and stand-still philosophy.” Sen. Weicker was “concerned over the recently announced White House directed NASA cuts but Pm much more concerned about the leadership of this nation . . . playing to our lowest, most immediate desires rather than our" highest future potential.” Apollo 17 had been “15 years in the making and thousands of years in the future will benefit.” Vietnam war “in 10 years has undone 200 years of building the American image and contributed not one year to the American dream.” Dr. Holt Ashley, Director of Exploratory Research and Problems Assessment in the Office of Research Applications of National Science Foundation, was installed as 1973 aiaa President. aiaa presented the Daniel Guggenheim Medal posthumously to William C. Mentzer, Senior Vice President for Engineering and Maintenance with United Air Lines, Inc., for “many-fold accomplishments in airline engineering, maintenance, and economic disciplines, which accomplishments contributed significantly to the achievement of today’s civil air transportation system.” The Elmer A.

Langley Research Center engineers and technicians were cooperating with investigators from West Virginia Univ. in a summer study to improve rural West Virginia housing with space age technology. The preliminary study was to lead to eventual construction and demonstration of a self-contained house or small community, “Space Station West Virginia,” incorporating modern technology to supply energy, water and sewage, fire control, and systems analysis. (NASA Release 73—132) July 18—27:	The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics sponsored an aeronautical technology display at the Soviet Exhibition of Economic Achievement in Moscow, aiaa also cosponsored, with the U.S.S.R. Committee for Science and Technology, a joint Symposium on Aeronautical Technology at the exhibition July 23 to 27. Advanced equipment to modernize civil air traffic control systems was displayed or depicted by 27 U.S. companies and reviewed by an estimated 25 000 aviation specialists from the U.S.S.R. and its East European allies. The joint symposium—opened by Federal Aviation Administrator Alexander P. Butterfield and the Soviet Minister of Civil Aviation, Gen. Boris P. Bugaev—covered air traffic control, airport and air system facilities, and new aircraft technology. Among participants were members of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on International Cooperation in Science and Space, (aiaa Release 7/20/73; Program; Shabad, NYT, 7/22/73, 43) July 19:	NASA’s X-24B lifting body [see July 5-6], flown by NASA test pilot John A. Manke, successfully completed its first captive flight from Flight Research Center, attached to a B—52 aircraft. Erratic B-52 power resulted in unintelligible telemetry traces and forced a switch to X—24B internal power. The telemetry cleared and excellent traces were returned. X-24B performance was adjudged satisfactory but the scheduled glider flight was postponed until July 24 to allow for battery recharge. The X-24B had been built around the existing basic structure and subsystems of the X-24A, which, like other lifting bodies, had been designed for reentry from space flight. But the X—24B had a new doubledelta shape with small blended wings and three vertical tails—parts of a configuration representing a forerunner of future aircraft capable of hypersonic (above mach 5) flight. Like its lifting-body predecessors, the X-24B would be air-launched by a B-52 aircraft from 12 000-m (40 000-ft). Subsequent flights would use the XLR—11 rocket engine to increase speed and altitude performance in the joint NASA—usaf program at Flight Research Center, (nasa prog off; nasa Release 73-130)
Aerospace Industries Assn, of America, Inc., issued its semiannual analysis of aerospace employment. Continued restraints in Government spending and an increase in foreign competition for existing markets were cited as causes of an expected continued decline in aerospace industry employment through June 1974. Employment had dropped by 33% since 1968. Nearly 950 000 persons had been employed in June 1973, but by June 1974 payrolls were expected to have been cut by about 32 000. The most significant decline would be among scientists and engineers— a reduction of 6000, 3.6% below December 1972. Employment of production workers was expected to decline by 13 000 jobs, leaving 460 000 employed by the end of FY 1974. Missiles and space employment was expected to decline by 28 000 workers between December 1972 and June 1974. Aircraft group employment faced a similar period of decline, from 556 000 to 533 000. Employment in the helicopter and general-aviation field was expected to increase 500 from June 1973, resulting in a work force of 22 500 by June 1974. Employment in the general-aviation aircraft field alone was expected to rise more than 20% during FY 1974. (Text)

The role of commercial aircraft in monitoring meteorological parameters and atmospheric constituents was discussed in a Science article by Lewis Research Center scientist Robert Steinberg. Wide-body jet aircraft could supply global atmospheric and tropical meteorological data. “While scientists are not in total agreement on the magnitude of the effect of particulates and gases on the atmosphere, there is almost unanimous concurrence that we are severely limited in information, and that global baseline concentration must he established for particulates and gases in the troposphere and lower stratosphere as soon as possible.” Commercial aircraft were flying 10 hrs a day on long-range flights, equipped with inertial navigation systems and central-air-data computers coupled to advanced data-storage systems capable of satellite interrogation. “This means that there is now a large amount of synoptic weather information which can be obtained with a minimum of effort and cost. Likewise, a start at obtaining measurements of atmospheric constituents on a global basis can be made now.” (Science, 4/27/73, 375-80) April 27—May 2:	Goddard Space Flight Center sponsored three scientific meetings: the X-ray Astronomy Symposium and the Goddard Scientific Colloquium met April 27 and the International Symposium and Workshop on Gamma-ray Astrophysics met April 30-May 2. Dr. Floyd W. Stecker, GSFC scientist, and Jean-Loup Puget of the Paris Observatory presented their theory before the gamma ray symposium that the galaxies had been formed when equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the universe coalesced into separate regions after the universe expanded and cooled from an extremely hot, dense state about 15 billion yrs ago. The regions could have grown to the mass of galaxy clusters by the time the universe had cooled enough to go from a plasma to an atomic gaseous state. The theory would account for the sizes, mean densities, and rotational speeds of galaxies and was consistent with Dr. Stecker’s interpretation of recently observed cosmic gamma radiation as resulting from matter-antimatter annihilation.

The cost-plus-award-fee contract extension would total $32 733 000. (nasa Release 73-198; jsc Release 73-129) September 29:	A Washington Post editorial praised the Skylab program: “The prospect of permanently orbiting manned space laboratories used to be the stuff of dreams. The Skylab program underscores how rapidly such science fiction is becoming scientific fact. It shows how quickly man is becoming more at home in space and more accustomed to the reality of extended space flight—to the extent that the most impressive human and technological feats have come to be regarded by laymen as almost routine. Since the first ‘giant leap for mankind,’ NASA’s achievements have produced a quantum jump in man’s comprehension of the universe. The task now is to build on that new foundation, and to secure an equal measure of political progress to insure that this new capability will be used for universal benefit.” (W Post, 9/29/73, A14)

The Nippon Electric Co. of Tokyo had won a contract to design and install the antenna and communications equipment for the first Swiss communications satellite station, the New York Times reported. The station was being built above the Rhone Valley in the Valais canton. (Lusinchi, NYT, 10/6/73) October 7—13:	The International Astronautical Federation (iaf) held its 24th Congress in Baku, U.S.S.R. In a message of greeting, the Soviet Council of Ministers said: “Nowadays, when important positive changes take place in international situations, ever more favourable opportunities for development of scientific communication, exchange of experience and uses of scientific achievements for practical needs of mankind open to scientists.” Academician Sergey Vernov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said Soviet artificial satellites, placed simultaneously in different orbits, had facilitated studies of many regions of earth’s radiation belts, including those where no space station had been before. He hypothesized the existence of an “unstable radiation zone” beyond the outer radiation belt where Soviet Electron satellites had recorded a flux of electrons with energies over 150 000 ev. He believed the zone to be a necessary link in the formation of the earth’s radiation belts. Honorary guests Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford, U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project commander, and Soviet Cosmonauts Georgy T. Beregovoy, Vitaly I. Sevastyanov, and Vladimir A. Shatalov participated in an open discussion. Shatalov, head of cosmonaut training, said the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. could be good and equal partners in conquering space. Stafford said cooperation in astp had already solved colossal technical problems. “And if we can solve problems in space we can, consequently, solve considerable problems on earth.” Soviet scientists reported on a man-plant interaction experiment in which four researchers spent six months in a closed biological environment simulating the earth’s biosphere. The Siberian test project, sponsored by the Krasnoyarsk Institute of Physics, had demonstrated that man could live in an artificial atmosphere created by green algae, fastgrowing wheat, and a variety of vegetables. The plants had been irrigated with sewage waste and with condensed moisture from the atmosphere. The researchers had breathed oxygen released by the plants, eaten the vegetables, and baked bread from the wheat during a simulated space trip in an underground chamber. A paper by Soviet specialists reported that an electric field might divert a flux of charged particles from a spacecraft. The spacecraft’s exterior surface might act as one of the field’s electrodes while the vacuum of outer space acted as an insulating medium, providing an effective radiation shield. Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, Marshall Space Flight Center Associate Director for Science, cochaired two sessions on scientific spacecraft systems. The 7th International History of Astronautics Symposium included the papers “From Back Fire to Explorer I” by Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director, Kennedy Space Center; “R. H.

(Lyons, NYT, 1/5/73, 4) January 5:	NASA began program cutbacks to adjust to a lower spending level in compliance with President Nixon’s $250-billion target for total Government spending in FY 1973. Space shuttle manpower buildup would be slowed, delaying the first orbital flight. Work on the High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) was being suspended at least one year and work on communications satellites would be phased out, with cancellation of ats-G. Work on nuclear propulsion would be discontinued and work on nuclear power curtailed. Plum Brook Station of Lewis Research Center would be closed. In aeronautics, quiet, propulsive-lift, experimental, short takeoff and landing (questol) aircraft would be canceled, but technology would continue to be developed. Skylab, space shuttle, Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (astp), Viking, Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, and many applications and aeronautics projects would be retained to continue essential elements for a balanced and productive space and aeronautics program within tight fiscal restraints. NASA also would continue development of a new front fan to reduce jet aircraft engine noise. NASA spokesmen told the press that the cutbacks would trim 700 civil servants from the NASA payrolls and would save the Government $200 million through June 30, 1973.

The large, multipurpose, orbiting, optical astronomical facility would be launched by the space shuttle, which also would return it to the earth for major maintenance and refurbishment. The LST would use a 3-m (10-ft) primary mirror and—because of its size, quality, and location above the earth’s atmosphere—would be able to resolve objects 10 times smaller and 100 times fainter than those observed by ground telescope, (msfc Release 73—110)
A Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial commented on the first anniversary of the Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite: “For Ohio alone, erts is telling truer tales about strip mining and pollution. For others it is doing such diverse things as charting safe routes for ocean shipping and forecasting water requirements of inland areas. The list of what already has been done and is yet to be done is almost endless.” (Cl PD, 8/14/73)	_ August 15:	NASA held an earth resources experiment package briefing at Johnson Space Center. Dr. Verl R. Wilmarth, erep project scientist at jsc, said that Skylab 3 Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Dr. Owen K. Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma, launched July 28 to crew the Orbital Workshop, had completed 10 erep passes and had exceeded four hours of data collection. They had photographed 125 test sites over the U.S., South America, Thailand, East Malaysia, and Australia under the conditions required by the individual primary investigators. Wilmarth said the equipment was “working great” with “essentially no problem at all with any of the camera systems.” (Transcript)
NASA launched two sounding rockets, one from Alaska and one from White Sands Missile Range. A Nike-Tomahawk from Poker Flats, Alaska, carried a Goddard Space Flight Center magnetospheric physics experiment to a 233.2-km (144.9-mi) altitude. The rocket and instrumentation performed satisfactorily. An Aerobee 170A from White Sands carried a Massachusetts Institute of Technology x-ray astronomy experiment to a 184.3-km (114.5mi) altitude. The rocket and instrumentation performed satisfactorily. (gsfc proj off)
The Soviet Mission Control Center at Star City, near Moscow, was described by U.S. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Director Glynn S. Lunney during a Johnson Space Center briefing on the Oct. 1-18 visit of a U.S. delegation to work with Soviet counterparts on the July 1975 joint docking mission. Soviet Mission Control was “not unlike the control centers ... in this country.” It was “characterized by consoles with some . . . large display screens down front and television display systems on the individual console.” The building housing Mission Control was in two sections. “One is sort of a wing where the main operations Control Room is and some auxiliary rooms and equipment.” Another wing held equipment for teletype, intercom, and TV. Lunney said a U.S.-built docking system and a U.S.S.R. docking system, “actually almost two docking systems, that were brought over by members of the Soviet test team,” had been undergoing tests at JSC since September. “The tests are almost complete with the mandatory test points that have to be taken. There’s a period . . . where some additional test points may be taken . . . and that will probably go on for the rest ... of November.” To date, the tests had gone smoothly. “I think what they are telling us is that the assumptions that went into the design appear to be verified and that indeed we can expect that same kind of results when we use the production hardware in the qualification test next year.” Lunney said U.S. delegates had learned that the Sept. 27-29 Soyuz 12 flight had tested fixes to the spacecraft to prevent reoccurrence of the fatal June 30, 1971, Soyuz 11 accident in which three cosmonauts died from decompression. He said that “all the fixes worked properly.” Modifications included use of spacesuits for launch and reentry, a gas supply and hose system, and a strong cap on the valve that had been triggered open accidentally; the cap now had to be fired pyrotechnically to release. Firings to separate the reentry module were modified and a manual override on the valve was made more accessible to the crew. Discussions had given “a fairly full treatment of the problem, to the point where we are satisfied that we know what happened and we know what the fixes are and they appear indeed to be very substantial.” (Transcript)
In its program of international cooperation, NASA launched Anik 2 domestic communications satellite for Telesat Canada and Intelsat-IV F—7 for Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization. A significant milestone was the Intergovernmental Agreement on U.S. and European cooperation on Spacelab, signed by the U.S., Belgium, France, West Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. To be funded and developed by nine members of the European Space Research Organization, the Spacelab would be carried into orbit by NASA’s space shuttle orbiter and would accommodate experiments and personnel on missions of 7 to 30 days. Notable progress was made in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, with the joint U.S.—U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission on schedule for July 1975 launch. Working groups met in both countries and a November Moscow meeting familiarized eight U.S. astronauts with the Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. Docking system designs were essentially completed and all hardware construction was on schedule. Joint dynamic testing of test units began at Johnson Space Center. Flight crews were selected in both countries. Eighty-three nations entered into Definitive Agreements for intelsat, permanently establishing the global communications satellite system envisioned in the U.S. Communications Satellite Act of 1962. Scientists from other nations cooperated in nasa studies ranging from investigations of the solar system to practical applications of space technology. Erts 1 and Skylab environment and resources data were used throughout the world. Scientists from 37 countries and the United Nations participated in Erts 1 experiments and Brazil and Canada established their own erts data-acquisition facilities. Four foreign experiments were carried on Skylab missions and foreign scientists participated in the Apollo solar telescope program and in correlated astronomy sounding rocket programs. Scientists in 19 countries and the U.N. participated in 40 Skylab data-analysis investigations. German and Australian scientists were coinvestigators for Pioneer 11 experiments and French and U.K. scientists for Mariner 10. Investigators from 40 nations and esro were selected to participate in the Apollo 17 lunar sample program. A joint working group of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and nasa held the third and fourth meetings on space biology and medicine, exchanging information on manned space flight. Parallel communications channels using Intelsat and Molniya comsat systems were planned for 1974 to support the U.S.—U.S.S.R. Direct Communications Link, with construction of earth stations in both countries for access to each other’s satellites. Work went forward for future cooperative satellite projects. Agreement was reached with Italy to fly San Marco C-2 in 1974. Negotiations were underway with West Germany for 1974 launch of the aeros-b aeronomy satellite and work continued on the experimental cts comsat to be launched with Canada, the helios solar probe with Germany, the intasat ionospheric beacon with Spain, the UK—5 stellar x-ray satellite, Canada’s Anik C, and U.K.’s X4 technology spacecraft. Negotiations were also underway on nasa launch services for the French-German Symphonic comsat in 1974 and two ESRO test comsats in 1976 and 1977. The U.S. and esro were about to enter agreement for an air traffic control and navigation satellite system. During the year nasa launched 30 sounding rockets from ranges in other countries, including rockets carrying foreign payloads or cooperative experiments. New sounding rocket agreements were signed with Australia, Brazil, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden.

The shortage reached crisis proportion with the embargo by Arab nations on oil shipments to the U.S. in retaliation for U.S. support to Israel during the October Arab-Israeli war. In a November speech President Nixon noted the U.S. was on the verge of “the most acute shortage of energy since World War II.” He called for reduced use of heat, electricity, and gasoline; announced Federal Government steps to lower energy consumption; asked the Atomic Energy Commission to accelerate licensing and constructing nuclear power plants; and asked for an emergency energy act. Nine energy bills, passed in rapid succession by the first session of the 93rd Congress, included authorizations for mandatory fuel allocation programs, construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline, a return to year-round daylight saving time, a speed limit on interstate highways, and the National Emergency Act. Soaring prices of all kinds of fuel, long lines of cars and banned Sunday sales at gas stations, and airline fare increases and schedule cutbacks marked closing months of the year. Economists forecast a possible depression as energy shortages aggravated an already recessed economy. Scientists sought additional sources of fossil fuels and, for the future, new sources of energy to make the U.S. energy-autonomous. The focus turned to NASA and its pioneering expertise in the technologies of solar energy and development of hydrogen as a substitute for gasoline in automobiles and aircraft. At the year’s end pending legislation endorsed NASA cooperation with other appropriate agencies in solving the worldwide energy shortage and in providing the U.S. with future sources of non-fossil-fuel energy.

Univ. of Texas physicists A. A. Jackson IV and Michael P. Ryan, Jr., proposed in a Nature article that the event that leveled forests in a wide region of Siberia on June 30, 1908, was the passage of a black hole that had plunged completely through the earth. They suggested that ships’ logs for that date be examined for evidence of an unusual occurrence. The object that fell on Siberia had been referred to as the Tunguska meteorite, although it had left no crater or other clearly identifiable meteorite residue. “We suggest that a black hole of substellar mass . . . could explain many of the mysteries associated with the event.” (Nature, 9/14/73, 88-89) September 14—23:	The first major international aerospace show in Latin America was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil. More than 250 firms from 11 nations displayed products from satellite equipment to metal forgings, aircraft, helicopters, and small components. Aircraft exhibited included the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier vstol [vertical or short takeoff and landing] fighter, Fokker F-28 twin-jet transport, Israel Aircraft Industries’ Arava cargo transport, Aeronautica Macchi MB-326 jet trainer-fighter, Aerospatiale A-300B Airbus, Canadair CL-215 amphibian, Northrop F-5E light jet fighter aircraft, and Lockheed C-5A heavy logistic transport.

Twin 26-m (85-ft) solid-fueled-rocket strap-on boosters would be attached to the core. The Titan-Centaur, scheduled to be launched on its proof flight in January 1974, mated the Titan III core vehicle and its twin solid-fueled rockets with the Centaur high-energy liquid-fueled final stage. The 49-m (160-ft), 3610-kg (7959-lb) configuration was designed to carry heavy payloads on orbital and planetary missions, such as the Viking Mars mission and the joint U.S. and West German Helios mission to the sun, during the mid- and late 1970s. The liftoff thrust of the twin solid-fueled boosters was 10.8 million newtons (2.4 million lbs). On its proof flight the Titan-Centaur would carry a mass model of the Viking spacecraft and a 66-kg (145-lb) Space Plasma High Voltage Interaction Experiment (sphinx) spacecraft, to measure in orbit for one year the interaction of space plasmas with high-voltage surfaces. The main purpose of the flight would be to demonstrate that the launch vehicle and launch facilities could support operational missions and that the Centaur could perform an operational two-burn mission and an operational three-burn mission carrying a payload to a synchronous altitude of 35 888 km (22 300 mi). The effort to integrate the Titan with the Centaur had begun in the mid-1960s when NASA recognized the need to fill a performance and cost gap between the Atlas-Centaur and Saturn launch vehicles, (ksc Release 215-73)	*

Work was to be concluded 12 mos after the contract award, (jsc Release 73-27) March 15-30:	Five U.S.-U.S.S.R. joint working groups met at Johnson Space Center and reached agreements on the July 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Technical specialists from each country would be in the other country’s control center during the mission and flight crews and specialists would be trained and made familiar with each country’s spacecraft and systems. Under a flammability agreement, the U.S. would provide fire resistant material for the Soviet cosmonauts’ flight clothing; the cosmonauts would use an Apollo headset in the Apollo spacecraft for communications to the Soyuz spacecraft over the Soviet communications link; the Soviet TV camera used in the Apollo spacecraft would be in a fireproof hermetically sealed container; and the still camera and film used by the cosmonauts in Apollo would be stored in a flameproof container. The U.S. would provide a 16 mm camera for Soviet use during docked operations in both Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft. Agreements were reached on the prescribed procedure if either country encountered anomalous results during test activities that concerned the other country and on mission planning for rendezvous. The groups agreed that additional testing was required on the docking seals, that the U.S. would limit Apollo control system thrusting in the roll axis to two thrusters to preclude excessive structural loads on the Soyuz spacecraft, and that an additional docking test could be performed on the second day, with the Apollo systems passive and the Soyuz active. Both countries agreed to perform and exchange safety assessments in fire, pyrotechnic devices, cabin pressure, and propulsion and control systems. The 47-man delegation of Soviet scientists and engineers included Cosmonauts Vladimir A. Shatalov and Aleksey S. Yeliseyev and the Soviet astp Technical Director, Academician Konstantin D. Bushuyev. At a March 19 press conference Bushuyev and U.S. astp Technical Director Glynn S. Lunney agreed that cordial, friendly, and cooperative progress was being made in planning the joint mission. Preliminary drawings of the two spacecraft had been exchanged so that mockups could be built. (C. M.

Ames Research Center biologists Paul H. Deal and Kenneth A. Souza had discovered an earth organism that could survive and grow in an environment resembling that of the outer planets of the solar system, NASA announced. The rod-shaped bacteria were swimming, growing, and reproducing in a highly alkaline solution of sodium hydroxide. The atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus were believed by some scientists to be highly alkaline. The discovery renewed questions of possible life on Jupiter, since the planet’s extreme alkalinity had been cited as a major deterrent to life. (NASA Release 73-238)

President Nixon transmitted to Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1973. The plan abolished the National Aeronautics and Space Council, including the position of Executive Secretary, and the Office of Science and Technology, including the posts of Director and Deputy Director, nasc had been created under the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, enacted July 29, 1958. Provisions of the plan would take effect July 1 unless Congress acted against the plan. In his transmission message the President said NASC had “met a major need during the evolution of our nation’s space program. Vice President Agnew has served with distinction as its chairman for the past four years. At my request, beginning in 1969, the Vice President also chaired a special Space Task Group charged with developing strategy alternatives for a balanced U.S. space program in the coming years. As a result of this work, basic policy coordination can now be achieved through the resources of the executive departments and agencies, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, augmented by some of the former Council staff.” In streamlining the Federal science establishment, the Administration was “firmly committed to a sustained, broad-based national effort in science and technology.” The research and development capability of executive departments and agencies had been upgraded. The National Science Foundation had “broadened from its earlier concentration on basic research support to take on a significant role in applied research as well” and had “matured in its ability to play a coordinating and evaluative role within the Government and between the public and private sectors. I have therefore concluded that it is timely and appropriate to transfer to the Director of the National Science Foundation all functions presently vested in the Office of Science and Technology, and to abolish that office.” The President also announced his intention to ask Dr. H. Guyford Stever, nsf Director, to take on the additional post of Science Adviser to advise and assist the Administration “on matters where scientific and technological expertise is called for” and to act as the President’s representative in selective cooperative programs in international science, “including chairing such joint bodies as the U.S.—U.S.S.R Joint Commission on Scientific and Technical Cooperation.” (PD, 1/29/73, 75-8; nasa Leg Off)

Dr. Karl G. Harr, Jr., President of the Aerospace Industries Assn, of America, Inc., testified on the effects of the Apollo program before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during NASA FY 1974 authorization hearings: Apollo “did not just sweep across our landscape to successful achievement of its specific objectives. Its effects on Earth are permanent and pervasive. Not just the hundreds of thousands of jobs it provided, the schools and homes it caused to be built, and the economic impact of the program itself; not just the invaluable accretion of scientific knowledge; not just the restoration of faith in American technological leadership—but a radical and enduring upgrading of technological capability throughout American industry. It is such advances that have enabled the United States to retain its preeminence in high technology production. And it is the continuation of such preeminence that is at stake when we consider the future of our space program.” (Transcript) April 5-26:	NASA’s Pioneer 11 (Pioneer-G), second Jupiter probe, was successfully launched into an excellent trajectory from Eastern Test Range at 9:11 pm est by a three-stage Atlas-Centaur-TE.........M-364—4 launch vehjcle. Eighteen hundred persons watched the nighttime launch after touring the Kennedy Space Center Flight Training and Vehicle Assembly Buildings, where Skylab was being prepared for a mid-May launch. Pioneer 11 sped away from earth at a velocity of 51 800 km per hr (32 200 mph), equaling the speed of Pioneer 10 (launched March 2, 1972, and still heading toward Jupiter), which flew faster than any previous man-made object. The primary objective was to obtain precursory scientific information beyond the Mars orbit with emphasis on investigation of the interplanetary medium during the 609- to 825-day journey, the Asteroid Belt, and Jupiter and its environment. The secondary objective was to advance the technology for long-duration flights to the outer planets. The 259-kg (570-lb) spin-stabilized spacecraft carried 12 scientific experiments to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and charged particles; the electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared ranges; and the asteroid-meteoroid population. During the encounter trajectory with Jupiter, the spacecraft would provide the best possible information on the radiation environment, provide good viewing conditions of Jupiter before periapses, and obtain a short occultation of the spacecraft by Jupiter. The spacecraft also carried a pictorial plaque identical to the one carried on Pioneer 10 for identification of its origin by any possible intelligent beings of another solar system. Six hours following launch the large number of thruster pulses used to precess the spacecraft and point the antenna toward the sun provided the impulse to deploy fully one of the two radioisotope thermoelectric generators that had failed to deploy completely at first. The magnetometer boom was deployed and the spin rate stabilized at 5.4 rpm. On April 6 four science instruments—the helium vector magnetometer, charged particles experiment, geiger tube telescope, and meteoroid, detector—were turned on. An April 11 midcourse correction moved the target point at Jupiter from slightly ahead of the planet as it moved on its orbit, and above the equatorial plane, to slightly behind the planet and below the equator. The adjusted course would allow several mission choices: to make an equatorial pass either close to or distant from the planet to inspect one or more of its moons; to pass over the flattened pole of the planet; to fly on to Saturn in 1980; or, like Pioneer 10, to leave the solar system and escape into interstellar space. The option chosen would depend on Pioneer 10 findings during its pass of Jupiter in December. Nine of the twelve experiments were turned on and were operating normally.	. The control center for Pioneer 11 was transferred April 16 from Jet Propulsion Laboratory to the Pioneer Missions Operations Center at Ames Research Center. On April 26 Pioneer 11, traveling at 9.34 km per sec (20 900 mph), was 14 350 000 km (8 920 000 mi) from the earth. A second midcourse correction was made. The operation of all spacecraft subsystems was normal and 11 of the 12 experiments were transmitting good data. Six to seven hits had been recorded by the meteoroid detector. The infrared radiometer remained to be turned on. The spacecraft was expected to enter the Asteroid Belt in August 1973 and reach Jupiter in December 1974. The Pioneer program, begun in 1958, was directed by Ames Research Center. Pioneer 6 and 7 (launched Dec. 16, 1965, and Aug. 17, 1966, to study the heliocentric space environment) and Pioneer 8 and 9 (launched Dec. 13, 1967, and Nov. 8, 1968, to study interplanetary phenomena) continued to supply data from heliocentric orbit on solar plasma, magnetic and electric fields, and cosmic rays.

Bean, Dr. Owen K. Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma completed their 42nd day working aboard the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist Joseph Airman said that a flare photographed by the Skylab 3 crew was about 17 times the cross-sectional area of the earth and “optically the biggest flare we’ve had during ATM and perhaps the biggest for this entire year.” Within 30 min after the event “high energy protons made it from the Sun to the earth as a consequence of this flare.” Confirmation had also been given by x-ray satellites and by short-wave fade-out and other ionospheric disturbances on the ground of a very intense x-ray event. Within two days, with the arrival of subsequent particles, an aurora would be visible at the latitude of Chicago and enough geomagnetic activity would occur to disrupt power lines in high latitudes. Hirman said that the flare had created enough energy to “run everything in the United States and the rest of the world combined for 500 years.” (Transcript)

Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released a statement on private communications of crews of the Skylab Orbital Workshop (launched May 14), after meeting with the Deputy Administrator, Dr. George M. Low; Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers; and Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs John P. Donnelly. A May 3 memorandum had authorized private communications for morale purposes (weekly calls from Skylab astronauts to their families), for “extreme” operational emergencies, and for medical reasons (to permit private doctor-patient relations). Following objections from some newsmen to the May 29 Charles Conrad, Jr., private conversation on operational matters, Dr. Fletcher had decided to instruct Mission Control’s Capsule Communicator to query the seriousness of a situation before permitting a private conversation from Skylab. Dr. Fletcher said in his new statement that he would rescind this instruction because “we believe it would be imprudent to discourage requests by the crew for private operational communications.” Paraphrases of the communications would he released to the press. “We will continue to leave it entirely up to the flight crew as to when to call for such a conversation, and will send no new instructions or clarification of instructions. This decision was reached so that we would in no conceivable way inhibit them from calling for a private conversation when they believe a need exists, and so that we will not jeopardize the safety of the mission.” (NASA Release 73—110)

Newspaper editorials commented on the repair of the Skylab Workshop by Skylab 2 astronauts as the mission, begun May 14, continued to pursue its objectives of photographing and studying the solar atmosphere. The Philadelphia Inquirer found “vast excitement in the Skylab adventure beyond potential dividends and the high drama of the suspense itself.” The astronauts’ repair of the Workshop “tells us, all jokes aside, that Americans have managed an accomplishment of delicacy, complexity and force that would have been beyond the imagination of all but a few visionaries a decade ago. That tells us, all doubts aside, that America can do wonders when it sets its mind to it.” (P Inq, 5/30/73) New York News: “We hope the lesson learned will not be lost on those who decry the ‘expense’ of manned space exploration. If we had relied on push-button robots instead of human ingenuity, it’s a good bet Skylab would have ended up a complete washout.” {NY News, 5/30/73) Christian Science Monitor: “Much of the technology spurred by space has applications nearer home. For example, modest solar-energy devices have already arrived on the market for home and commercial use after solar-energy pioneering in space. But even without such applications the Skylab venture would represent a remarkable manifestation of the problem-solving talent especially needed now that Americans are waking up to problems they hardly knew they had.” (CSM, 5/30/73) San Francisco Chronicle: “Who could feel anything short of total admiration for the undeniable courage of the astronauts for venturing into an oven of 125 degrees Fahrenheit [325 kelvins] to carry out their endangered mission? The coolness and confidence of men who reckon the limits of what they can do and then run the risks of approaching those limits while their defective vehicle is speeding in space at 17,500 [28 200 kilometers] an hour are something to celebrate.” (SF Chron, 5/30/73)
Components of a navigation system similar to that of the lunar roving vehicles launched aboard Apollo 15, 16, and 17 (July 26, 1971, and April 16 and Dec. 7, 1972) to explore the lunar surface had been turned over by Marshall Space Flight Center to the Univ. of Kentucky for possible incorporation into a remotely controlled mine-surveillance vehicle, the Marshall Star announced.

The “spreading Watergate scandal”—arising from investigations of alleged White House implication in the burglarizing and electronic surveillance of Democratic National Committee Headquarters by members of the Committee to Reelect the President—had slowed down Administration research and development decision making, a Science & Government Report editorial said. The subsequent disintegration of presidential staff had created “a decision-making paralysis that is subtly but steadily spreading to agencies far remote from current headline events.” The editorial quoted an Office of Science and Technology staff member as saying that “just about every thing that the President set out in his Science and Technology message 14 months ago requires some sort of approval at the White House level now and then, and there’s no one to talk to there.” The newly created White House National Energy Office had “already received some shock waves from the scandal through the resignation of presidential assistant John D. Ehrlichman,” who had been appointed by President Nixon to a three-man Special Committee on Energy to “give political weight” to neo decisions. Difficulties flowing from Watergate were aggravated by the impending transition in management of the Science-Government relationship. Many OST responsibilities would shift to the National Science Foundation Director, Dr. H. Guyford Stever, when the OST was abolished June 30. “Whether for good or ill, the change is a change, and necessarily involves the dissolution of longstanding relationships, some of them dating back to early post-Sputnik days.” {Sci & Gov Rpt, 5/15/73, 7)
Soviet helicopter designer Nikolay I. Kamov died at age 71, He had received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for his services in the development of Soviet helicopter design and construction. (Tass, FBIS—Sov, 10/28/73, Ul) November 25:	Compelling evidence of the existence of a previously predicted black hole in space had been discovered by a Univ. College team in London, using nasa’s Oao 3 Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (launched Aug. 21, 1972), NASA announced. The scientists, headed by Dr. R. L. F. Boyd with Dr. Peter Sanford, had tied the binary supergiant star system HDE 226868 to the x-ray source Cygnus X-l and had detected evidence of the structure of the star system’s gas clouds swirling around and into the x-ray source, or black hole. Using Oao 3, they had also observed extended x-ray sources identified with clusters of galaxies like those in the Perseus, Coma, Virgo, and Centaurus constellations. They believed enormous upheavals in the nucleus of the Seyfert galaxy were affecting the entire Perseus cluster of several thousand galaxies. They also believed the x-ray emission detected in the Seyfert galaxy might be associated with the inverse Compton effect, in which high-velocity electrons traveling near the speed of light collided with radio and optical photons. Their conclusions suggested that x-rays originated in the most active galaxies of the cluster, (nasa Release 73251)

Pioneer 10—launched March 2, 1972, toward Jupiter—had traveled farther into space than any man-made object, NASA announced. The spacecraft, when it swung hy Jupiter on Dec. 3 to give man his first closeup look at that planet, would set a speed record of 132 000 km (82 000 mi) per hr, breaking its own earlier mark of 51683 km (32 116 mi) per hr set at launch. After the Jupiter encounter, Pioneer 10 would be hurled by the planet’s gravity beyond the solar system toward the red star Aldebaran in the constellation Taurus. It was expected to cross the orbit of Pluto in 1987 still transmitting scientific data to the earth. The onboard experiments had been designed to yield useful data as far as 30 to 40 astronomical units, 4.5 billion—6.0 billion km (2.8 billion—3.7 billion mi), away. The spacecraft had been tracked and controlled so precisely that it would arrive at Jupiter within less than a minute of the time predicted at launch. NASA had submitted three applications to the National Aeronautic Association and the Federation Aeronautique Internationale for Pioneer .70’s unmanned interplanetary space flight records: maximum distance traveled from the sun, maximum distance of communications from the earth, and duration of the mission during which the spacecraft had been functioning, (nasa Release 73-183)

Flight Research Center was evaluating a side-stick flight controller for the Air Force YF-16 lightweight fighter aircraft on the frc digital fly-by-wire aircraft, a modified F-8 fighter with an electronic control system. The new side-stick controller was stationary and used pilot-applied force to maneuver the aircraft. The inflight studies were to aid fighter pilots to control highly maneuverable aircraft, provide information for the Air Force lightweight fighter program, and provide a base for future research. The side-stick control replaced conventional sticks between the pilot’s legs, impractical in future high-performance aircraft where the pilot would fly in supine position, (frc Release 27-73)
Mobile launcher 3, used for five manned Apollo/Saturn V launches, was being deactivated at Kennedy Space Center. A task team of NASA and contractor employees, organized by the icsc Support Operations Directorate, was removing and storing reusable equipment from the platform that was two stories high, 49 m (160 ft) long, 41 m (135 ft) wide. Nine swing arms had already been removed; other items to go included an acceptance checkout equipment room; a computer station; racks of electronic, timing and communications gear; and instrument cables. Cable salvage alone was expected to cover half the deactivation cost. With completion of deactivation in mid-1974, equipment worth millions would have been salvaged for future use in space shuttle and other programs. The basic launcher structure would be modified for use in space shuttle launches, (ksc Release 288—73)

A model for the interaction of the solar wind with very thin hydrogen gas in deep space, developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration geophysicist Dr. Thomas E. Holzer, would aid future space flight planning and provide data on the origins and fate of universe, NOAA announced. The presence of thin hydrogen gas in interplanetary space had been observed by Ogo 5 (launched by NASA March 4, 1968). Interaction of the solar wind and interstellar hydrogen could become important at astronomical units from the sun. Neutral hydrogen could become charged and associated with the solar wind. Some solar wind energy would be converted to random motion or heat. At the same time, the velocity of the solar wind would be diminished. Neutral hydrogen could act as gentle, penetrable barrier to the solar wind, (noaa Release 73-7)

A Science editorial criticized the Nixon Administration’s abolition of the post of Presidential Science Adviser and the Office of Science and Technology: The deed had been done in a way “not worthy of a great nation.” The office had first been abolished, “then someone woke up to the fact that it served important functions. After scrambling around, someone had the inspiration to transfer the functions of the office to the National Science Foundation (nsf) and appoint [Dr. H.] Guyford Stever (head of the nsf) as science adviser. The solution has merit. However, if it is to represent more than a gesture, Stever and the NSF will be overloaded with conflicting responsibilities.” (Abelson, Science, 2/16/73, 641) February 17:	The nasa-U.S.S.R. joint mission to measure ice, surface, and atmospheric conditions in the Bering Sea began, following arrival at the experiment site of the U.S. Coast Guard ship Staten Island, NASA instrumented Convair 990 Galileo aircraft, and Soviet weather ship Priboy and 11—18 aircraft.

The National Academy of Sciences released Plans for U.S. Clear-Air Turbulence Research in the Global Atmospheric Research Program. The report of a panel of the U.S. Committee for the Global Atmospheric Research Program (garp) recommended that increased Federal logistic support be provided for clear-air turbulence studies in planning, because of importance to aviation safety and to understanding effects of small-scale motions on large-scale dynamics of atmosphere. The Dept, of Defense should make available additional C-130 and RB57 aircraft for vertical-motion measurements in Project Wamflex (wave-induced momentum flux experiment) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s continuous-wave radar should be modified to detect clear-air turbulence in the tropopause. And NASA should provide additional instrument support including scaning lidar. (Text)
NASA research to improve general-aviation-aircraft flight control systems and increase the use of new flight equipment was described by Flight Research Center and Langley Research Center engineers at the Society of Automotive Engineers Business Aircraft Meeting in Wichita, Kan. frc flight tests of a new attitude-command-control system aboard an experimental aircraft had shown that a flight-path control system similar to an automobile’s steering system was a great improvement over conventional control systems. Use of the new system, plus an improved flight display tested by frc, could reduce the general-aviation workload throughout most flights. Astronautics Corp. of America was developing a low-cost flight director under NASA contract. The Univ. of Kansas would evaluate its economical, separate, surface-stability-augmentation flight control system on a modified commuter aircraft under a NASA grant. LaRC was developing structural design technology to provide the greatest chance of pilot and passenger survival in a crash. Full-scale aircraft crashes were simulated by using a 60-m (200-ft) pendulum to swing instrumented aircraft into the ground at controlled angles and speeds. Resulting data were used to design aircraft to absorb more of the crash forces without destroying the cabin areas. NASA stall and spin studies at LaRC used a vertical wind tunnel, unique in the U.S., to develop data for designing aircraft with improved spin recovery characteristics, (nasa Release 73-63; frc Release 7-73)
Mikhail D. Millionshchikov, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and a principal spokesman in Soviet scientific contacts with the West, died in Moscow at age 60. He had contributed significantly to the studies of the turbulent flow of liquids and gases, nuclear energy, and new techniques for direct energy conversion. On April 28, 1970, Academician Millionshchikov—as head of a 10-man Soviet delegation to a conference sponsored in Washington, D.C., by the Fund for Peace— had suggested U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space exploration. This proposal had been “the first public suggestion by a Soviet spokesman of this hope,” the New York Times reported later. Apollo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman, also a conference participant, had proposed the next day that the two countries agree to exchange space engineers as a first step toward joint space cooperation. {NYT, 5/29/73, 32) May 28:	A New York Times editorial commented on the repair of Skylab 1, damaged on launch May 14: “Many people deserve credit for this remarkable turn of events. First there were the Houston ground controllers who maneuvered the crippled Skylab into an optimal position. ... A small but varied army of technicians hurriedly contrived not one but three possible ways of creating a parasol in space so as to replace the missing heat shield that had created the most trouble. Finally, the Sky-lab astronauts mastered their new tasks in an incredibily short time, reached orbit in the neighborhood of Skylab, surveyed the damage, and made the most essential ‘fix,’ the sunshade, which yesterday brought the station’s temperature down to tolerable levels.” It had been a grueling test for all concerned. “But for the moment, at least, the Skylab project has been truly resurrected from near-death.” (NYT, 5/28/73, 14)

NASA held two Skylab press briefings at Johnson Space Center, while the Skylab 3 crew (launched into orbit July 28) completed its 56th day of<< work in the Orbital Workshop. At an Apollo Telescope Mount briefing, Skylab principal investigator James E. Milligan said that the Skylab 3 crew had operated the ATM console photographing the sun for 300 hrs. It was “remarkable how few mistakes they have made.” The sun also had been cooperative. “During this mission we’ve had everything from one of the quietest Suns I have ever seen to a Sun that was as active as it ever is, at least during a moderately active day during Sunspot maximum.” The crew had taken “thousands and thousands and thousands” of photographs of “on the order of one hundred” flares, coronal transients, and prominences. Jack H. Waite, Marshall Space Flight Center’s manager of corollary experiments, said at a corollary briefing that all the planned objectives of the corollary experiments had been completed. MSFC’s Material Processing Program Manager Robert L.

The enormous expense, the high risk, the much-ballyhooed and grossly exaggerated claims about the pertinence of manned earth orbital flights to the quality of life on earth are creating an ever-widening credibility gap between the public interest and a vested interest inherited from the space of the nineteen-sixties. The result is the squandering of public funds.” He suggested “indefinite postponement of the space shuttle program, a reduction in excessive NASA management costs and the establishment of a moderate unmanned space program emphasizing space science and applications” on a less than $2-billion budget.

NASA held two Skylab 1—2 postmission briefings at Johnson Space Center. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, told a NASA press conferC ■ 3 ence that, “as near as we can tell, essentially all of the objectives that were anticipated for this mission have been completed. And needless to say none of us really dreamed that this could be done at the time that the meteoroid shield failed to deploy. So it exceeded our wildest expectations at that time.” Skylab 1-2 could be symbolized by a hammer, and the Skylab 2 astronauts could be characterized as “the master tinkerers of space.” The mission’s anomalies had made no major impact on NASA’s budget. Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, jsc Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, said at a crew medical status briefing that the astronauts had “looked rather wobbly and unsteady when they got out of the spacecraft.” The crew—aware of the increased pull of gravity—had said they felt as if they were “very heavy . . . like about a two-G load.” All three men had experienced dizziness, lightheadedness, and some nausea. Astronaut Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin felt more of these effects than Charles Conrad, Jr., and Paul J. Weitz. His blood pressure had dropped to a critical level 25 min after splashdown and he had to inflate his spacesuit to force the blood back up from his legs to his brain. During medical tests aboard the recovery ship Ticonderoga, Conrad had performed at his premission level.

Discovery by use of nasa’s Oao 3 (Copernicus) Orbiting Astronomical Observatory that the density of the universe was much lower than expected was announced on the first anniversary of the satellite’s launch. Princeton Univ. scientists Dr. John B. Rogerson and Dr. Donald G. York reported they had used Oao 3’s telescope to determine the relative abundance of deuterium (a heavy form of hydrogen) in interstellar gas to be one deuterium atom for every 100 000 atoms of gas. Knowing what fraction of hydrogen became deuterium and accepting the theory that deuterium had been created moments after the “big bang” believed to have started the expansion of the universe, the scientists had calculated the amount of matter created and the average density of the current universe. The extremely low density indicated that there was not a relatively large amount of invisible mass in the universe. (NYT, 8/21/ 73, 13; A&A 1972)
A helmet designed by Ames Research Center and Aerotherm Corp. to keep the heads of helicopter pilots cool had been tested successfully by stock car racing driver Richard Petty, NASA announced. The helmet, lined with polyurethane through which water circulated, kept the pilot’s head cool, lowering heat stress on his entire body. (NASA Release 73-120)
The House passed H.R. 9430, a bill naming a Federal building and carrying an amendment that repealed the 1972 naming of Jet Propulsion Laboratory after former Rep. H. Allen Smith (R—Calif.). (CR, \2/1>/13, H10468)
NASA launched two sounding rockets. A Black Brant IVB, launched from Wallops Island, carried an Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center payload to a 603.5-km (375-mi) altitude to flight-test a modified version of the Black Brant IVB. The rocket and instrumentation performed satisfactorily. A Black Brant VC, launched from White Sands Missile Range, carried a Harvard College Observatory experiment to a 268.8-km (167-mi) altitude to collect data on solar activity to collaborate with data collected by the Apollo Telescope Mount instruments aboard the Skylab Orbital Workshop (launched May 14), now manned by the Skylab 3 crew (launched July 28). A capsule containing film was parachuted to the earth and recovered 160 km (100 mi) from the launch site. One detector failed but the experiment was 80% successful. The rocket performed satisfactorily. (NASA proj off; Reuters, B Sun, 8/10/73, A6) August 10:	NASA announced it had granted a five-year patent license to K-H Enterprises to manufacture and sell a burglar-intrusion detection system based on an Ames Research Center-developed capacitance pressure transducer. The transducer had been developed by ARC scientist Grant Koon to measure pressures on wind-tunnel models. In its application as an aircraft intrusion detection system, the transducer sensed the physical mass of an approaching person in the aircraft’s vicinity as a change in capacitance and activated an alarm, (nasa Release 73-148)
Military and aerospace expenditures in the laser field were expected to average about $317 million annually in the next five years, according to a study by technological market research organization Frost & Sullivan, Inc., the New York Times reported. The FY 1973 laser market would be about $290 million, more than double earlier estimates. Operational thermal (laser) weapons were probably 10 yrs in the future, but prototype experiments were expected to be made by 1975. Technology had progressed to high-energy, gas-dynamic lasers that produced light beams when their internal gases were heated, expanded, and forced through small nozzles at supersonic speeds. The laser’s most notable military contribution thus far had been bombs directed through the air toward targets illuminated by laser lights. A new system, target-recognition attack (tram), was being developed to spot targets day and night with an infrared detector bore-sighted with a laser range finder to illuminate the target. (Middleton, NYT, 9/13/73, E22) September 13-October 17:	Ames Research Center conducted a five-week experiment to determine the effects of weightlessness and reentry into earth gravity on female space shuttle passengers. The experiment, with 12 Air Force nurse volunteers participating, was a follow-on to similar studies on men made in 1972. Following two weeks of orientation and medical studies, eight of the nurses would simulate weightlessness with absolute bedrest while four acted as ambulatory controls. After two weeks of immobility, the eight would be subjected to g forces expected when the shuttle entered the atmosphere at a mission’s end. The final week would be for recovery and testing, (arc Release 73-107; arc Biomed Research Div)
Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, released the statement given out at the nasa FY 1974 budget briefing held Jan. 27: “The budget the President has approved for NASA for FY 1974, like those of other agencies, has been reduced substantially below previous plans and expectations to hold total government spending to the targets set by the President. At the same time, the budget will permit NASA to carry forward a substantial and significant program in space and aeronautics.” The budget provided for continuing the major projects in the schedule announced Jan. 5 and for starting two new projects: Nimbus-G, “another in NASA’s series of experimental earth oriented satellites, which will be directed at environmental pollution and oceanographic measurements, and LAGEOS, a new geodetic satellite for extremely accurate measurements of movements of the earth’s surface.” In addition to reductions in programs announced Jan. 5, the budget required “that we stretch out schedules in a number of ongoing projects. The second Earth Resources Technology Satellite (erts-b) will be delayed two years, until 1976. This will allow it to carry an additional sensor. Tiros-N, the prototype of a new series of operational meteorological satellites for the National Weather Service, will be delayed by about one year to 1977. “We will also undergo another belt-tightening in NASA. By the end of FY 1974 our civil service complement will be reduced 1880 positions below the FY 1973 end strength approved in the FY 1973 budget. This reduction includes the previously announced reductions related to the termination of our nuclear programs.” Despite a “sharp decrease from the level budget anticipated last year,” Dr. Fletcher was “very pleased with the program content we were able to retain. Clearly from what has been said today and on January 5, we will have to curtail several activities that are of major importance to the nation.” But “we have been able to keep NASA’s main line program essentially intact and each of the programs curtailed will still be done, either at a later date than anticipated or in an alternate way to that planned last year. Although I, personally, would like to see a higher NASA budget, I believe we can capitalize on the belt-tightening required to produce even greater yield for the tax dollar in future years.” NASA was “making substantial efforts to reduce future costs . . . while still giving the nation a strong program in space and aeronautics.” Additionally, a prime object of the space shuttle program was to reduce costs of operating in space. NASA intended to “develop and introduce new design concepts and management approaches which, together with the relaxed weight and size constraints of the Space Shuttle, will result in substantially lower development and operating costs.” NASA Comptroller William E. Lilly discussed personnel cutbacks necessitated by the new budgetary limitations. The total NASA Civil Service reduction of 1880 positions would include a Marshall Space Flight Center cut of 650; Goddard Space Flight Center, 158; Kennedy Space Center, 100; Manned Spacecraft Center, 75; Wallops Station, 17; Lewis Research Center, 660; nasa Hq., 150; and Ames, Langley, and Flight Research Centers, a total of 70. From a peak Civil Service complement of more than 34 000 in 1967, nasa would be reduced to under 25 000 employees by June 1974—a drop of 30%. Total employees from all sources—contract and in-house—would drop from the 1966 peak of 420 000 to about 100 000. (Text; Transcript)

Hospital room by Marshall Space Flight Center, nasa announced. The devices permitted remote control by severely handicapped or paralyzed patients of communications systems and appliances for comfort and recreation, (nasa Release 73-169) August 25:	A New York Times editorial praised Skylab 3 (launched July 28 to man the Orbital Workshop launched May 14) as the mission passed the 28-day mark set by Skylab 1—2 (May 14-June 22), to become the longest manned space mission to date: The Skylab 3 astronauts “already have much more than mere longevity in space to their credit. Their two long walks in space have permitted them to do more useful work in orbit outside their vehicle than human beings ever have done before. Their scientific observations and experiments—particularly the study of the sun—have added much to human knowledge.” With its midpoint near, Skylab 3 had already “proved itself one of the most productive manned space missions since the first sputnik went into orbit almost a generation ago.” (NYT, 8/25/73, 22) August 26:	Albion, Mich., police had reported the recovery of a spacesuit worn by Astronaut Alan L. Bean during the Apollo 12 mission (Nov. 14-24, 1969), the Associated Press reported. The suit, valued at $6000, had been on loan from the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum when it was taken from the Kingman Museum in Battle Creek, Mich., a week earlier. (W Post, 8/27/73, A22) August 27:	nasa’s Manned Spacecraft Center was officially rededicated as Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in ceremonies at jsc, attended by Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator; Texas Gov. Dolph Briscoe; and Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson. A bust of the late President Johnson by sculptress Jimilu Mason, donated by the Houston Chamber of Commerce and the Albert Thomas Space Hall of Fame, was unveiled. A Johnson Room opened in the jsc Visitor Center displayed the original U.S. copy of the Treaty for the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, signed in 1967 during President Johnson’s Administration. At the dedication Dr. Fletcher said that President Johnson had needed “great political courage” 1965-1967 to fight for funds for NASA programs of the 1970s such as Skylab and Viking. “The decision to continue with a strong space program after Apollo may . . . prove to be the most important of all the decisive actions Lyndon Johnson undertook on behalf of space progress.” Earlier in the day Astronaut Alan L. Bean, commander of the Skylab 3 crew orbiting the earth after July 28 launch to join the Orbital Workshop for 59 days, had radioed: “We think the work in which we are engaged right now would not have been possible except for [Johnson’s] strong support and leadership in the Senate and the Presidency.” President Johnson himself had said—on a March 1, 1968, visit to msc—referring to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958: “The one legislative enactment that I suppose I am proudest of is the bill that I wrote and introduced that made possible NASA, that brought into existence this great facility and others in the program throughout the nation.” President Nixon had signed the law making the name change Feb. 17. Mr. Johnson had died Jan. 22. (Transcript; jsc Roundup, 8/17/73; 8/31/73; McElheny, NYT, 8/28/73, 24)

A secret Department of Defense study and an independent Air Force study had shown that costs on the F-15 fighter aircraft could run $1.7 billion —21%'—above estimates given to Congress, the Washington Star and Daily News reported. The engine developed for the F—15 had had 52 hitherto undisclosed hardware breakdowns. Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., was convinced the F—15 would not encounter the cost problems plagued by other large aircraft programs but was concerned about the engine problems. Seamans had asked NASA to help solve the problem and find better ways to develop new aircraft engines, the newspaper said. (Kelly, W Star & News, 3/18/73, Al) March 19:	President Nixon submitted Aeronautics and Space Report of the President: 1972 Activities to Congress. He said in his transmittal message: “The Apollo program was successfully concluded with the flights of Apollo 16 and 17. These missions were designed to obtain maximum scientific return and provided almost half the lunar exploration time in the Apollo program. Though it is far too early to attempt a definitive assessment of the value of this program, it is clear that one result will be a quantum jump in both our scientific knowledge and our technical expertise. Our unmanned satellites include a variety of vehicles ranging from meteorological, navigational and communication satellites to a new experimental spacecraft providing information on our resources and environment. Increasing practical applications for satellite technology confirm the immediate value of our efforts in space, while observatory satellites and others carrying specialized scientific instruments provide accurate and dependable data never before available to scientists on earth. The conclusion of the Apollo programs marks only another step in this Nation’s push into space.” The year 1972 had also seen advances in aeronautical research and development. “It should be emphasized that work in this field is particularly vital if America is to maintain its leadership in the development and production of civil and military aircraft and engines. Our efforts in aeronautics and space will allow us to meet demands in these and other important domestic and foreign areas.” The report said the year had been one “of significant, advanced accomplishments in lunar exploration, exploration of the planets and the universe, and in aeronautical concepts.” A balanced program had been initiated to “continue exploration in space, space science studies, application of space for benefits on earth, and the development of new technology for space and aeronautics” by the 16 Federal agencies reporting.

Skylab 3 scientist-astronaut Dr. Owen K. Garriott, Jr., received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Phillips Univ. during Homecoming Day ceremonies in his home town of Enid, Okla. (Oklahoma Journal, 11/15/73) November 16—February 8, 1974:	The Skylab 4 Apollo spacecraft carrying a three-man crew was launched into near-earth orbit and rendezvoused and docked with the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop (launched May 14) for the third and final manned mission in the Skylab program. Despite persistent problems with the spacecraft’s onboard control moment gyroscopes, the crew proceeded successfully, making four space walks and setting new manned flight records. The astronauts collected significant data in medical experiments, astronomy (including 121 observations of Comet Kohoutek), and earth resources surveys for 84 days before undocking for a safe return to earth Feb. 8, 1974. The CSM/S-IVB combination was placed in a phasing orbit with a 222.3-km (138.1-mi) apogee and 148.2-km (92.1-mi) perigee 9 min 45 sec after launch. Eight minutes later the CSM separated from the stage. The S-IVB/iU deorbit maneuver was commanded on the third orbit and the stage impacted in the Pacific Ocean at 3:00 pm EST. After five rocket maneuvers the CSM rendezvoused with the Orbital Workshop during the fifth orbit. Docking was achieved at 5:02 pm EST after two unsuccessful attempts. Carr radioed down to Mission Control, “Great to be home.” During rendezvous and docking Pogue suffered from motion sickness and vomited. Later, in a conversation unintentionally taped by the astronauts and transmitted to the ground the astronauts decided not to report the incident to ground controllers. Capsule communicator Alan B.	Shepard later told the crew, “We think you made a fairly serious error in judgment” in the attempt to cover up Pogue’s condition. Carr agreed, “It was a dumb decision.” Pogue recovered by late evening, Carr suffered only minor motion sickness problems, and Gibson remained in good health. Carr, Gibson, and Pogue entered the multiple docking adapter at 9:32 am est Nov. 17 (Mission Day 2) and began Workshop activation. They found a welcoming note on the teleprinter: “Jerry, Ed and Bill, welcome aboard the space station Skylab. Hope you enjoy your stay. We’re looking forward to several months of interesting and productive work. Signed, Flight Control.” In addition they found three dummies dressed in tan flight suits left by Skylab 3 Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Dr. Owen K. Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma. Pogue replenished the fluid in the Workshop’s primary cooling system, which had developed a leak during the Skylab 3 mission [see July 28—Sept 25]. The 5l^-hr task required Pogue to punch a hole into the plumbing lines to inject the fluid. Spacecraft activation was completed Nov. 21. November 22—February 4:	The first extravehicular activity (EVA1) began at 12:44 pm est Nov. 22. Pogue and Gibson moved through space to install film cassettes in the Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) cameras, deploy experimental hardware, and repair the control system for an earth-scanning antenna that had jammed during the Skylab 3 mission. Gibson, anchored in a portable foot restraint on the bottom of the spacecraft, held onto Pogue while Pogue rewired the instrument, bypassing a short circuit and restoring the antenna to 80% of its original capacity. Gibson and Pogue reentered the Workshop and began pressurization at 6:19 pm EST. The 6-hr 35-min eva surpassed the 6-hr 31-min record set Aug. 6 by Skylab 3 Astronauts Garriott and Lousma. At 3:45 am est Nov. 23 one of three moment gyros which controlled the spacecraft overheated and was ordered shut down by Flight Controller Philip C. Shaffer. Shaffer told the press at Johnson Space Center that a near-normal mission could still be flown but it would take more time and fuel to make maneuvers. Pogue began extensive photographic study of Comet Kohoutek. By the end of the mission Comet Kohoutek had been observed and recorded 121 times as it approached, looped around, and retreated from the sun. The first full day of scientific research was scheduled for Nov. 27. While photographing a barium cloud—created by the launch of a Black Brant IVA sounding rocket from Poker Flats, Alaska—the spacecraft’s thruster attitude-control system used three times the amount of nitrogen gas fuel anticipated. The extra fuel use, in addition to poor weather conditions, forced postponement of the first earth resources experiment package (erep) pass while ground teams designed improved techniques for managing attitude control and fuel consumption. For the first time Carr pointed the space station’s six large solar telescopes at an unusually active region of the sun. The first erep pass was made Nov. 29 during a 23-min 8850-km (5500-mi) sweep from the southwestern U.S. to South America. In a Johnson Space Center press conference Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said that the ground team had concluded that the Nov. 28 problem had been caused by an incorrect input of initial conditions into the fuel management program. Restrictions on maneuvers were eliminated and, with proper fuel management, the mission could “continue essentially as planned.” On Dec. 1 the astronauts photographed a laser beam pointed at them by Goddard Space Flight Center scientists who were testing the lasers as a reference point for possible use in spacecraft navigation and communications. Earlier attempts to spot the flashing green laser had failed. In a Dec. 13 Mission Day 28 Review of the first third of the mission Program Director Schneider said the Skylab 4 crew had accomplished 84 hrs of atm solar viewing, 45 separate observations of Comet Kohoutek, 80 earth observation experiments, and 12 erep passes, although a significant portion of the data from 9 passes had been lost because of wrong camera filters. Schneider said that the crew was in good physical and mental health and that their performance had been outstanding, but flight planners had needed to adjust work schedules to the pace of the crew. A spectacular limb prominence on the sun, estimated to be the largest observed in 25 yrs, was recorded by the crew Dec. 18—19. Astronauts Carr and Pogue opened the hatch for EVA-2 at 11:55 am est Dec. 25, Christmas Day. Pogue mounted three special cameras to photograph the sun and Comet Kohoutek before it passed behind the sun. Photographs were taken of the comet’s tail and coma. Carr replaced film cassettes in the atm and repaired a jammed filter on an ATM camera. The constant movement of Carr and Pogue outside the spacecraft disrupted Gibson’s efforts to aim the laboratory cameras at Kohoutek and the thruster attitude control system used more fuel than planned. Carr and Pogue reentered the Workshop and closed the hatch at 6:56 pm EST after a 7-hr 1-min spacewalk that surpassed Gibson and Pogue’s Nov. 22 record. The Dec. 28 perihelion passage of Comet Kohoutek was marked with a live ground-to-air televised conference between Dr. Lubos Kohoutek, discoverer of the comet (1973F), and the Skylab 4 crew. Gibson said that the comet, as seen on the white-light coronagraph, was growing dramatically. The tail fanned out 20° from the central axis and could be seen back to a distance three times the diameter of the coma. Dr. Kohoutek congratulated the “first human beings studying a comet from outer space” and wished them a flawless splashdown in February. The crew began EVA—3 at 12:29 pm est Dec. 29. Carr and Gibson moved outside to photograph the sun and Comet Kohoutek as it began its trajectory away from the sun. Gibson said the comet had a spike and a tail. “That spike is very evident. It is not 180 degrees out from the tail, but more like 160 degrees. It is yellow and orange . . . just like a flame. It seems to be the same distance out as the tail, and there is a diffuse amount of material which goes out and joins up with the tail.” The astronauts recorded other astronomical phenomena, retrieved samples from the magnetospheric particle collector, and retrieved the comet observation camera. At 3:58 pm EST Carr and Gibson moved back inside the Workshop and closed the hatch after 3 hrs 29 min. On Jan. 10 the mission was given a go-ahead for a seven-day extension, with weekly reviews through the end of a tentative 84-day total mission. In the 56-day mission review at JSC, Skylab Program Director Schneider said the crew was “in good spirits and excellent physical condition and the spacecraft is in good shape to continue.” On Jan. 13 and 14 the Skylab 4 crew photographed a solar flare from beginning to end—the first opportunity for scientists to study the complete life cycle of a solar flare. At 10:10 pm edt Jan. 14 Carr, Gibson, and Pogue had been in orbit 59 days 11 hrs 9 min, surpassing the record manned flight time in space on a single flight set by Skylab 3 Astronauts Bean, Garriott, and Lousma during their July 28—Sept. 25 mission. Mission controllers struggled with gyroscope problems with increasing frequency throughout the mission. On Jan. 22 the second control moment gyro was in the distress position for six hours, causing Skylab officials to order the recovery force into port at San Diego three days earlier than planned, erep passes were limited and other maneuvers reduced to conserve fuel and reduce stress. Despite nearly three dozen gyro 2 stress periods, gyros 2 and 3 held up for the rest of the mission. At 1:46 pm edt Jan. 25 (MD—71) the crew passed the record cumulative time in space of 69 days 15 hrs 45 min set by Bean during the Skylab 3 mission. The hatch was opened for EVA-^1 at 11:19 am edt Feb. 3. Gibson and Carr measured the atmosphere surrounding the Skylab solar instruments to evaluate the light-scattering produced when photos of the sun were taken. The astronauts also photographed the sun with an x-ray sensitive camera, retrieved film from ATM cameras, and removed a plate and piece of rubberized material from the side of the spacecraft for a study of effects of nine-month exposure to the space environment. eva operations ended at 4:38 pm edt after 5 hrs 19 min. The csm undocked from the Workshop at 6:34 am edt Feb. 8 (MD-85) and made a fly-around inspection of the Workshop. One of two redundant CSM rocket thruster systems developed a leak during reentry preparation, forcing the astronauts' to reenter without a. backup thruster system. Just before sm jettison at 10:45 am edt, a procedural error caused circuit breakers to open, blocking the stabilization and control thrusters from firing. Carr quickly took manual control for reentry. The cm splashed down upside down at 11:17 am edt Feb. 8, 282 km (175 mi) southwest of San Diego and 5 km (3 mi) from the recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans—ending 1214 revolutions of the earth. The capsule was righted by flotation bags while the carrier maneuvered alongside, and the CM was raised by a crane to the hangar deck about 40 min after landing. Immediate medical examinations found the crew had no apparent severe effects from their long exposure to weightlessness. They had grown one to two inches taller from stretched spinal columns in space and had lost some muscle mass, with body fluids readjusted for zero gravity; but they lost most of the slim-trim look on return to the earth. They were back to normal in a few days. The astronauts would remain aboard ship in San Diego for medical examinations and, after a brief dockside ceremony Feb. 10, would fly to Houston. The men would be allowed to rejoin their families but contact with the general public would be restricted for one week. The Skylab 4 mission achieved its primary objectives of performing Saturn Workshop operations, reactivating the Skylab orbital assembly in earth orbit, obtaining medical data for use in extending the duration of manned space flights, and performing inflight experiments. All 58 planned scientific and technical experiments in biomedicine, solar astronomy, solar physics, and engineering were accomplished, erep instruments were operated during 39 passes over the earth and the crew spent 338 hrs photographing the sun and Comet Kohoutek with atm instruments. Skylab 4 was officially adjudged a success Mar. 29, 1974. Major records set by the mission included the longest-duration manned space flight to date, 84 days 1 hr 16 min; the longest cumulative time in space for a man, 84 days each for Carr, Gibson, and Pogue; the longest orbital EVA, 7 hrs 1 min Dec. 25; the longest cumulative inflight eva time for one mission, 22 hrs 24 min; and the longest distance in orbit for a manned mission, 55.5 million km (34.5 million mi). Skylab 4 was the third and final mission to man the Skylab Orbital Workshop. Skylab 2 astronauts had worked aboard the laboratory 28 days, May 15-June 22, conducting experiments as well as making repairs to the orbital assembly to salvage the Skylab program. The Skylab 3 crew collected data in medical experiments, solar astronomy, and earth resources surveys for 59 days, July 28-Sept. 25. There were no plans to send another crew to inhabit the Workshop, which would be g-dormant—lacking in power, air conditioning, and atmosphere—by Feb. 9. Skylab 1 was expected to remain in orbit for nine years before reentering the earth’s atmosphere and burning up.

The crew of Skylab will mark in space the 16th anniversary of America’s first step toward the heavens. From the launch of a 30-pound [13.6-kg] space satellite, we progressed to the exploration of the Moon, which is helping to determine Earth’s place in the universe. Now we are moving to determine through space technology man’s own place in the universe, and to greater understanding of our own planet. As we are grateful for the success of our previous ventures into space, and as we look to the success of that which is imminent, let us never take for granted the skill and courage and devotion of those who labor on behalf of the United States space program. Let us rather pause to reflect with pride upon what we have done, asking God’s blessings upon our efforts, and God’s grace upon those who bravely place their lives at the service of peace for all mankind.” (PD, 11/19/73, 1338)

President Nixon sent to Congress United States Foreign Policy for the 1970’s: Shaping a Durable Peace. The report recalled agreements made during the May 1972 Moscow Summit Meetings, including the agreement on a joint rendezvous and docking of Apollo and Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in 1975. “Since the summit, all of the agreements have been carried out as expected. Our space agencies have conducted preliminary tests of models of the spacecraft docking system and crew training will begin this summer. The Joint Committee on Environmental Protection met in Moscow in September 1972 and planned 30 collaborative projects on a variety of subjects. . . . The Joint Commission on Science and Technology met in Washington in March 1973 and agreed to carry out some 25 projects in . . . energy, chemistry, biology, and agricultural research. American and Soviet naval officers will meet this year to review the agreement on reducing incidents between ships and aircraft. This process of cooperation has begun to engage an ever widening circle of people in various professions and government bureaus in both countries. Direct contact, exchanges of information and experience, and joint participation in specific projects will develop a fabric of relationships supplementing those at the higher levels of political leadership. Both sides have incentives to find additional areas for contact and cooperation, and I anticipate further agreements patterned on those already concluded.” (PD, 5/14/73, 455-653)

Effects of FY 1974 budget restrictions on Kennedy Space Center was conveyed to ksc employees in letter from ksc Director, Dr. Kurt H. Debus. The personnel ceiling for June 30, 1974, would be 2309—112 less than the current total onboard strength. The necessity for an average grade ceiling of 11.22 by June 30, 1973, would impose “further constraint in terms of available options.” (Text)
An exhibit honoring black pilots, including the 450 who flew combat missions in World War II, was opened at the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, (upi, W Star & News, 4/8/73, 4) April 15-June 16:	Storm penetrations by high-performance jet aircraft enabled ground-based scientists to check radar returns against airborne measurements of in-cloud turbulence for the first time. A two-month experiment by the Air Force Systems Command’s Cambridge Research Laboratories and the National Severe Storm Laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at Norman, Okla., fingerprinted the wind to gather faster, more accurate information to identify tornadoes and devastating windstorms. Hazardous air currents swirling inside storms registered a distinct impression on doppler radar. Radar signals were processed through an electronics package to permit observers to pinpoint and measure gusts or turbulence. With severe storm patterns identifiable, observers could forecast their threat to aircraft in flight and people and installations on the ground, (afsc Release OIP 101. 73; afsc pio) April 16:	The Skylab Orbital Workshop atop its Saturn V launch vehicle was moved from the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center to Launch Complex 39, Pad A, for May 14 launch.

Mars 4 and 5 were 19 515 000 km (12 126 000 mi) and 18 584 000 km (11548 000 mi) from the earth and would reach Mars in February 1974. Mars 6 and 7 were 16 664 000 km (10 354 000 mi) and 15 623 000 km (9 708 000 mi) from the earth and would reach Mars in March 1974. Radiation and magnetic measurements were being made and cosmic rays were being studied, Sagdeyev said. The stations also would investigate solar noise in the meter wave band as well as register the flux of solar plasma. United Press International reported later that Western space experts had speculated that a landing craft might carry a Marsokhod roving vehicle to explore the Martian surface. UPI also reported that it was believed that the U.S.S.R. departure from the usual practice of not announcing mission goals was to demonstrate Soviet willingness to cooperate with the U.S. in view of the plans for a 1975 joint U.S.— U.S.S.R. mission.

First anniversary of the launch of Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite from Western Test Range July 23, 1972. Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, at an anniversary celebration at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, said the use of space technology to solve the earth’s problems was “a second giant stride for mankind.” Erts 1 had had “a profound effect on the thinking of the world, particularly on our approach to the emerging problems of protecting our environment and maintaining the quality of life for all of Earth’s people. I think it means that we do have to be sensitive to how we use these precious resources; not just clean air and water, but clean land.” In the program to follow, “the ocean is also going to be a precious resource that we must conserve.” Dr. Fletcher said 38 countries were participating in the ERTS program, with 300 principal investigators—200 in the U.S. and 100 in foreign countries—examining ERTS data. Dr. William Nordberg, Chief of Goddard Space Flight Center’s Laboratory for Meteorology and Earth Sciences, reviewed Erts 1’s year-end status: its multispectral scanner was fully operational, the retum-beam-vidicon TV cameras had been turned off but could be reactivated, one of the two tape recorders was still operating, although at reduced capacity. More than 60 000 erts scenes—equivalent to an area more than four times the globe—had been imaged, 333 000 unique messages had been relayed from some 140 platforms at remote sites, and nearly 3 million photos had been reproduced at the NASA Data Processing Facility.

A New York Times editorial praised Skylab 3’s solar observations: “The special value of the observations on the sun arises from that body’s extraordinary behavior this month.” An unexpected burst of tremendous solar activity had occurred. “An unprecedented wealth of data on this startling phenomenon [had] been gathered . . . , which should contribute significantly to helping scientists understand the physics and chemistry of the vast celestial body that is the source of almost all the energy available on earth.” (NYT, 9/23/73) September 24:	A Memorandum of Understanding on international cooperation in NASA’s space shuttle program was signed in Washington, D.C., by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and Dr. Alexander Hocker, Director General of the European Space Research Organization (esro) . Nine ESRO-member countries would design, develop, manufacture, and deliver a Spacelab flight unit to be carried in the space shuttle orbiter. The Spacelab would comprise a pressurized manned laboratory module and an instrument platform, or pallet, to support telescopes, antennas, and other equipment requiring direct space exposure. The Spacelab would be transported to and from orbit in the orbiter payload bay and would be attached to and supported by the shuttle orbiter throughout 7- to 30-day missions. At the mission’s end, the Spacelab would be removed and prepared for its next mission. The estimated $300-million to $400-million Spacelab cost would be borne by Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland—the European nations that signed, with the U.S., the Intergovernmental Agreement for space shuttle cooperation [see Aug. 14]. The agreement was open for signatures by other nations as well. Under Memorandum of Understanding terms NASA would manage all operational activities, including crew training and flight operations, following delivery of the Spacelab unit in late 1978, about one year before the space shuttle’s scheduled first operational flight. NASA planned to carry a European flight crew member on the first shuttle flight and subsequent European flight crew opportunities would be provided in conjunction with ESRO or ESRO-member-govern-ment projects. NASA would make the shuttle available for Spacelab missions on either cooperative or cost-reimbursable basis. NASA would procure from ESRO any additional Spacelab units needed for U.S. programs and would not develop any further units duplicating the Spacelab’s design and capabilities. Final signature of the Memorandum of Understanding having established the cooperative Spacelab program, NASA had decided to use Spacelab terminology. Steps were instituted to change designations of the Sortie Lab Task Force and Task Team at Marshall Space Flight Center to Spacelab Task Force and Task Team, (nasa Release 73-191; nasa Shuttle Off, omsf; Spacelab Newsletter, 9/26/73)
Former astronaut Frank Borman, now an Eastern Air Lines, Inc., senior vice president, left Moscow after a visit to the U.S.S.R. at the invitation of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. During the visit, which began April 28, Borman laid a bouquet at the Kremlin wall where Yuri Gagarin and other cosmonauts were buried and visited the cosmonaut training center and a Salyut orbital station mockup at Star City. In an interview he said that he believed the 1975 U.S.—U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz space flight was “the forerunner, the prototype to exactly the type of mission that we’ll eventually see going to Mars. It is very difficult to project the pace at which space exploration will go forward, because it doesn’t depend on technology so much as it does on economic and political action. But I think that by the end of this century we will have a manned earth mission to Mars.” (Tass, fbis—Sov, 4/30/73, L2; 5/3/73, G2; Moscow News, 5/19-25/73)

Results of Apollo 14 and 16 (launched Jan. 31, 1971, and April 16, 1972) heavy-particle dosimetry experiments were reported in Science by scientists from Johnson Space Center and the General Electric Research and Development Center. Earlier measurements using Apollo helmets as dosimeters had indicated that a significant 1% of certain nonregenerative motor-control cells in the bodies of astronauts in space would be killed by radiation from densely ionizing, heavy atomic nuclei with the current Apollo spacecraft shielding. Doses of heavy particles penetrating the CMs of Apollo 8, 12, 14, and 16 correlated well with calculated effects of solar modulation of the primary cosmic radiation. Differences in doses at different positions inside the CMs had indicated that the redistribution of mass within the spacecraft could enhance safety from the biological damage that would otherwise be expected on manned, deep-space missions.

An Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial saluted Skylab as “a triumph of man’s ingenuity, endurance and indomitable spirit.” The May 14-June 22 Skylab 1—2 mission had been “a tremendous demonstration of why man is vital to the broad expansion of space missions that looms for the next decade, and it demonstrated on live television for every taxpayer who cared to watch exactly what the space shuttle is all about.” The first Skylab crew had salvaged 80% of a successful mission and a $2.5-billion investment from the prospects of total disaster, opened new vistas on the scientific work that could be accomplished from a space platform, and proved that man could live and work usefully for extended periods in space. (Hotz, Av Wk, 7/9/73, 7) July 9-20:	Apollo-Soyuz Test Project specialists from NASA and the Soviet Academy of Sciences met at Johnson Space Center. They continued development of trajectories and flight plans, agreed tentatively to a scientific experiment plan, and familiarized the Soviet crew of tbe July 1975 mission with the Apollo spacecraft. Participants included astp technical directors Glynn S. Lunney for the U.S. and Academician Konstantin D. Bushuyev for the U.S.S.R., Apollo and Soyuz flight crews, the Working Group on Mission Model and Operational Plans, and members of the Working Group on Control and Guidance. The Soyuz cosmonauts [see May 24] attended lectures on and demonstrations of the Apollo spacecraft, docking model briefings, and crew activity discussions. Lunney and Bushuyev reviewed astp milestones and reaffirmed that they were on schedule. On July 14 the Soviet delegation heads and cosmonauts toured assembly and checkout facilities at the Rockwell International Corp. plant in Downey, Calif., where astp work was being carried out. Meeting results were announced by NASA in a July 20 communique. Progress had been reported on crew activities, control center operations, trajectories, and other operational aspects. Agreements were reached on November familiarization of the U.S. flight crews with Soyuz equipment in the U.S.S.R., a preliminary cosmonaut training plan in the U.S. in April 1974 and February 1975, and astronaut training in the U.S.S.R. in July 1974 and March 1975. The training plan was expected to be completed in November and flight procedures finalized by the end of 1974. Final selection of joint experiments would be made in October 1973. Flight safety reports would be exchanged. The U.S.S.R. had specified the Moscow Center of Control of Manned Space Flight near Moscow as astp control center and had announced that Cosmonaut Aleksey S.

Declining jobs at Kennedy Space Center would level off at about 9600 total for contractors and Civil Service in 1976 when the space shuttle buildup began, Today quoted KSC Director of Administration George A. Van Staden as saying. The number would be a drop from the current 14 500 but would mean community stability in employment for the first time. Previously NASA had projected 6000 to 7000 jobs for shuttle operations. Employment would fall by 3000 at the end of 1973, with completion of Skylab, and would drop again after the mid-1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission. When the 9600 level was reached in 1976, jobs would gradually build up for two years, to about 10 800 in 1978 when shuttle testing began. (Today, 3/22/73, Al)

A five-week Ames Research Center experiment to determine women’s qualifications for space flight had shown women to be as physically fit for travel in weightlessness as men, NASA announced. The experiment— in which 8 of 12 Air Force flight nurses had two weeks of total bed rest in weightlessness simulation, while 4 acted as ambulatory controls—was one of a series to investigate responses to space flight conditions, looking forward to use of the space shuttle by other than pilot-trained astronauts. NASA emphasized that the test was to determine women’s qualifications for space flight and did not represent a commitment to add women to the astronaut corps. Dr. Harold Sandler, head of the experiment team, said the bedridden nurses were weaker after the experiment and showed a 50% reduction in their tolerance to various stresses. “But the same is true of men astronauts.” (nasa Release 73-218; AP, P Inq, 10/25/73)
Successful applications of earth resources surveying by satellite were described by representatives of agriculture and the lumber, oil, and aerospace industries at a Johnson Space Center press briefing sponsored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Lockheed Electronics Co. earth resources coordinator Gordon R. Heath said surveys from Earth Resources Satellites would provide lumbermen “a continuous flow of up-to-date information which has never before been available to them,” a new management tool for timber lands. “And better management will balance supply and demand . . . and help stabilize lumber prices.” Lumber company executive James B. Webster said the development of earth resources surveying was “one of the most important events in the history of man.” Incipient damage to trees from insects and forest fires had previously been impossible to detect. “And what we’ve got here is ... a system which will permit us to know what’s happening all over the world, with all the world resources at any given time.” Dr. Richard Phelps, technical information director for an agricultural firm, said a photo taken over a northern California area by Erts 1 (launched by NASA July 23, 1972) had been “a tremendous help” in complementing information from ground sources on farm crops. “It’s still very difficult for us to realize that we can obtain so much detail from an electronically reconstituted print transmitted from a satellite as far away from the earth as Wichita, Kansas, is from Houston.” (Transcript)

U.S. and U.S.S.R. delegates met in Vienna to continue Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (salt). (Tass, fbis-Sov, 5/9/73, HI) May 9:	The House Committee on Science and Astronautics favorably reported H.R. 7528, a $3.074-billion nasa FY 1974 authorization bill replacing the original $3.016-billion H.R. 4567. Increases in research and development funding included $25 million for the space shuttle, to total $500 million; $12 million for space applications, to total $159 million; $34 million for aeronautical research and technology, to total $180 million; $10 million for space and nuclear research and technology, to total $11 million; and $500 000 for technology utilization, to total $4.5 million. Overall R&D decreases were: $7 million in space flight operations, to $548.5 million; $8 million in space science programs, to $37 million; and $10 million in tracking and data acquisition, to $240 million. The budgets for construction of facilities and research and program management remained at $112 million and $707 million. The Committee said its $10-million reduction in Skylab funding, to $224 million (within space flight operations), reflected a “success postured program” without major problems and expressed confidence in NASA Skylab management. Space shuttle funding was increased $25 million to provide more effective program implementation and hold total program funding “at or below the current projection.” Total reductions of $8 million in funding for orbiting explorers, physics and astronomy, and lunar and planetary exploration supporting research and technology would be applied to the Earth Resources Survey Satellite program to permit immediate reinstatement of the erts-b project, on which the Committee placed “the highest priority.” In the aeronautics program, a $14-million increase—from $18 million to $32 million—was recommended “to investigate and demonstrate noise reduction modifications to current narrow-body jet aircraft” and $20 million was added to reinstate the quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (questol) aircraft program terminated in January. The $10-million increase in space nuclear research and technology funding was “to maintain a viable, long-range capability in advanced nuclear power and propulsion research.” It was probable “that any sensible energy research program undertaken by this nation would involve a significant part of this continued program.” (CR, 5/1/73, D452; H Rpt 93-171; Text)
Abandonment of technology, a “source of man’s strength,” would be a senseless alternative to its further development and use, Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner, Massachusetts Institute of Technology President, warned in a Technology Review article. Man’s exploitation of and dependency on the environment could not be changed through greater understanding of science and its application. Even a relevant technology alone would not suffice. Man needed “to develop the ability to estimate rationally and to choose among alternate courses of action, particularly when new technology is concerned. Above all, we need the humility to admit that we will not find any absolute answers or permanent solutions.” But the fallacy of the approaching doomsday argument was “that it ignores the considerable evidence we already have that man can in fact modify his behavior fast enough to avoid the catastrophic disasters predicted by the doomsday-sayers.” The evidence included the fact that scarcely a decade after Rachel Carson’s warning against pesticides (in her book Silent Spring) “those chemicals are severely controlled—possibly too much so—and biodegradable equivalents are on the verge of being introduced.” Lake Michigan’s marine life was nearing extinction 10 yrs ago; “by vigorous ecological controls it has been restored.” Development and control of the rapidly changing synthetic environment had become as important as contending with nature. Those who saw only evil in technology “fail to recognize that our situation would be much worse if the search for new technological solutions was stopped.” The challenge was “to move on from where we are to technologies and ways of employing them that will avoid uncontrollable effects in the future. Stopping science will shut off new knowledge and weaken our efforts to reverse the present situation. Technology alone is not the answer, but without technological developments few answers are likely to be found.” More than 30 yrs ago Dr. Vannevar Bush had called science the endless frontier; “it remains that today. The range of exciting research now exceeds that which was imaginable when Dr. Bush coined the title.” (Tech Rev, 5/73, 10-13) June 1:	Skylab 3’s target launch date had been changed to July 27, NASA announced at a Johnson Space Center press briefing. SL-3, to carry the second crew to the Orbital Workshop launched May 14, previously had been scheduled for Aug. 8. The new target date was set because unexpected use of Skylab hardware during the Skylab 1—2 mission had exposed electronics, batteries, and systems to unusual environments. Deputy Skylab Program Director John H. Disher said a July 27 launch would give greater solar power input, because the relation of the sun to orbit plane at that date would give the spacecraft a greater percentage of time in the sun. The precise date would be set after the end of the Skylab 2 mission. (Transcript; NASA Release 73—111)

Dr. Eggers testified before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Energy during a hearing on energy research and development: “Particularly close ties are developing between nsf/rann and NASA in the field of Energy Research and Technology.” The major focus was on terrestrial applications of solar energy. Lewis Research Center was especially active in joint work on requests for proposals on solar thermal areas, photo-voltaics (use of the generation of electromotive force when radiant energy fell between dissimilar substances), flat plate collection, and heating and cooling of buildings. NASA had made a preliminary inventory of its test facilities applicable to nsf’s solar energy research program. nsf had requested NASA to review the status of solar insolation data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and, working with noaa, to examine the need for better data and methods. Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Cal Tech Environmental Quality Laboratory were jointly conducting workshops and studies in water heating and other solar technology applications. A NASA Wind Energy Workshop at LeRC would pursue plans for a wind energy research program. Other areas of NASA participation included research into bio-conversion of organic materials to fuels, thermal batteries and superconducting transmission technology, earthquake engineering, regional environmental systems, trace contaminants, and fire.

Radio signals from Comet Kohoutek, racing toward a Dec. 28 pass behind the sun were picked up by scientists using the Kitt Peak, Ariz., radio telescope, nasa reported. It was the first strong evidence of radio emissions—produced by electrically excited molecules of methyl cyanide, a gas previously observed in the region of the Milky Way where new stars were formed—from any comet and the first evidence that methyl cyanide molecules existed in comets. The press quoted a Goddard Space Flight Center spokesman as saying, “Comet Kohoutek appears to be bringing a sample of the distant interstellar matter into the solar system for the first time.” (upi, W Post, 12/12/73, A23)
Representatives of major U.S. automobile manufacturers began visiting Jet Propulsion Laboratory for demonstrations of a NASA-developed system to enable the automotive industry to meet legal limitations on automobile engine emissions [see above]. JPL engineers had had promising results in reducing pollution while increasing engine efficiency in laboratory tests of the system, but the work was in its early stages. Dr. William H. Pickering, jpl Director, had said automotive company representatives had been invited “to assess the utility of the system with a view to the possibility that they might wish to work cooperatively with us.” (nasa Release 73-184; Witkin, NYT, 9/17/73, 1)
Navy plans for collecting temperature and cloud-cover data directly from Air Force weather satellites were reported by Aviation Week & Space Technology. A receiver and computer processing center at Monterey, Calif., would prepare data for worldwide dissemination to the fleet and would process weather photos and atmospheric vertical-temperature profiles.

NASA held an Apollo-Soyuz Test Project news briefing at Manned Spacecraft Center. U.S. Technical Director Glynn S. Lunney said the U.S.S.R. had agreed to lower the Soyuz cabin pressure to within 350 newtons per sq cm (5 lbs per sq in) of Apollo pressure during the July 1975 joint docking mission, to eliminate two-hour depressurization for each crew member before transfer to the other spacecraft. The change Would permit time for all three astronauts and two cosmonauts to fly in the others’ spacecraft. Previously, Only two astronauts had been scheduled to make the transfer. Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford, commander of the U.S. crew, said “the mission is going to be one of the most difficult . . . because it involves a different country, different language, different operating techniques. . . . But it can certainly open the doors for future cooperation between the countries, can enhance our capabilities” for progress together. Astronaut Donald K. Slayton, who would fly his first mission since he was disqualified from Project Mercury’s Aurora 7 flight (launched May 24, 1962) because of an erratic heart rate, said, “I think I’ve been pretty fortunate. And I don’t believe in looking back at the past too much except in relation to what benefit it will give me in the future.” Astronaut Vance D. Brand, who would make his first space flight, said, “I am really happy to get on this mission. I think as we look back over the years, it’ll be regarded as a very historic thing . . . having the doors open between the Soviet Union and the United States.” (Transcript)

A survey of knowledge about technology and research at the Univ. of Michigan by Chairman David Fradin of the Federation of Americans Suporting Science and Technology (fasst) was reported in Air Force Magazine. Of student respondents, 50% to 75% knew the Federal Government was the major source of research and development funds, that it took 6 to 10 yrs to research and develop a new product, that the U.S. had a positive balance of trade in high-technology and agriculture products, and that the trend in U.S. trade had been negative. More than 75% of respondents did not know the amount of Federal expenditure for defense or for human and physical resources, or that aerospace was the Nation’s largest manufacturing employer. Scientific effort was deemed unnecessary for national defense by 25% to 50%. From 50% to 75% felt the space program had helped U.S. technical growth, but that money spent in going to the moon had been wasted; they considered tangible space program benefits like new knowledge of the environment to be more important than aerospace leadership, national prestige, or keeping ahead of the U.S.S.R.

nasa launched an Aerobee 200A sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range carrying a Goddard Space Flight Center astrophysics experiment to a 213.2-km (132.5-mi) altitude. The flight was nominal until 250 sec into the flight, when high-voltage problems developed. Final results would be determined after recovery of the payload, (nasa proj ; off) August 23-September 13: Intelsat-IV F—7 communications satellite was launched by nasa for Communications Satellite Corp. on behalf of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (intelsat). The 1379-kg (3041-lb) satellite was launched from Eastern Test Range at 6:57 pm edt by an Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle into a highly accurate transfer orbit with a 35 819.5-km (22 257.2-mi) apogee, 548.1km (340.6-mi) perigee, and 27.3° inclination. NASA’s primary objectives were to conduct design, performance, and flight-readiness reviews for the Federal Communications Commission; to ensure compatibility of intelsat spacecraft with NASA launch vehicles and launch environmental conditions; and to launch Intelsat-IV F—7 into a transfer orbit that permitted the apogee-kick motor to insert the spacecraft into a synchronous orbit on the equator over the Atlantic Ocean. During a design life of seven years the spacecraft would add 12 TV channels to those available between the U.S. and other countries and would increase the telephone capacity by 3500 two-way circuits. The apogee-kick motor was fired at 8:30 am edt Aug. 25 and Intel-sat-IV F—7 entered a near-circular orbit with a 35 778-km (22 231.4-mi) apogee, 35 773-km (22 228.3-mi) perigee, 1435.6-min period, and 0.4° inclination. The spacecraft was at 327° east longitude, drifting at 0.15° per day, and was expected to reach its planned station of 330° east longitude over the Atlantic Ocean within 10 days. NASA adjudged the mission a success Sept. 13. Intelsat-IV F—7 was the fifth communications satellite in the Intelsat IV series. Intelsat-IV F—4 (launched Jan. 22, 1972) was operating satisfactorily over the Pacific. Intelsat-IV F—5 (launched June 13, 1972) was operating over the Indian Ocean.

Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, discussed plans for the June 18—23 summit meeting to be held by President Nixon and Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev in Washington, D.C., and San Clemente, Calif., at a Washington, D.C., press briefing. Asked why Brezhnev would not be visiting Johnson Space Center as had been reported [see June 7], Dr. Kissinger said, “There were various ideas for various possible stops, but given the fact that a maximum amount of time was always intended to be devoted to discussion ... it simply proved impossible.” {PD, 6/18/73, 771-8)
Twelfth anniversary of the May 5, 1961, launch of Freedom 7 by the Mercury-Redstone 3 launch vehicle, on the suborbital mission which carried Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., as the first U.S. man in space. {Marshall Star, 5/2/73, 1) May 6:	Langley Research Center Director Edgar M. Cortright received the degree of Doctor of Science honoris causa at the 152nd Annual Commencement of George Washington Univ. in Washington, D.C., and gave the commencement address to the University’s School of Engineering and Applied Science. He said it was perhaps “a blessing in disguise” that the U.S. was running out of fossil fuels. In seeking new energy sources, “you will develop clean energy. And you will develop it within our own resources, thus alleviating the balance of trade problem.” Three sources appeared particularly promising: nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, and solar energy. “In addition, you may even tap the heat of the Earth’s core.” (Newport News, Va., Daily Press, 5/10/73; Langley Researcher, 5/11/73, 1) _
Experiments by international groups using the intersecting storage rings of the European Nuclear Research Center (cern) on the Swiss-French border had shown that protons grow when accelerated to great energy, the New York Times reported. New questions were raised as to what would happen within the nucleus of an atom that was packed with protons and neutrons and subjected to high-energy acceleration. Experiments had indicated that the proton—once thought a homogenous building block of the atomic nucleus—harbored processes and forces yet to be discovered. (Sullivan, NYT, 3/9/73, 1) March 11:	The U.S.S.R.’s Lunokhod 2 began its third working day on the moon. The roving vehicle was 400 m (1300 ft) above its landing site at the upper rim of the 3.5-billion-yr-old-crater. Lunokhod 2’s primary task during its third working day would be to study the crater thoroughly. (Tass, fbis-Sov, 3/13/83, LI) *	The book 13: The Flight That Failed—an account of the aborted Apollo 13 mission (launched April 11, 1970) by Henry S. F. Cooper, Jr.— was reviewed by Joseph McElroy in the New York Times Book Review: In a spacecraft so full of safety valves and designed redundancies “it had seemed incredible that two of three fuel cells from the two liquid oxygen tanks in the service module could go dead. . . . But to lose two fuel cells and then eventually two oxygen tanks? Not possible.” Command module pilot John L. Swigert, Jr., had said after the mission that if anyone had thrown at the crew a simulation of what actually happened “they’d have thought it unrealistic.” To have had less than this confidence, McElroy said, would have been unrealistic. The care and skill with which the many teams of NASA technicians work, plus the computers whose development may be “the main reason NASA could achieve a moon landing so soon” had created “an efficiency as unprecedented as the Apollo 13 disaster was implausible to the engineers at Houston Mission Control.” Cooper’s “plain, detailed picture of the teams at their consoles and in discussion and over the intercom ‘loop’ and under the adroit supervision of Eugene Krantz, a flight director who was unquestionably an executive hero of Apollo 13, gives their work a fascinating muscle and texture that might surprise those inclined to think this side of NASA boring.” (NYT Book Review, 3/11/73, 4-5) March 12:	Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science, testified on the status of space science programs and plans during hearings on NASA’s FY 1974 authorization before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: “The largest and most significant current project is Viking, a program to continue the exploration of Mars with two automated spacecraft during the 1975-76 opportunity.” A Mariner spacecraft would be launched in October or November toward Venus. “As the Mariner passes close to Venus its path will be bent and it will be accelerated toward . . . Mercury. If all goes well, we will make our deepest penetration toward the sun and get our first view of the sun-scorched Mercury. Pioneer G is ready for shipment to Cape Kennedy. It will be launched in April 1973 and will follow Pioneer 10 [launched March 2, 1972] through the asteroid belt to explore Jupiter. “We are proceeding with the development of the two Mariner spacecraft planned for launch to Jupiter and Saturn in 1977. The experiments and experiment teams have been selected. We are proceeding also with spacecraft design and will be purchasing some of the subsystems—those common to Viking—in Fiscal Year 1974. The use of common subsystems and leftover Viking hardware is helping us to minimize costs on this project. The major manned mission of 1973 is . . . Skylab, which will have many scientific experiments aboard. The most important and the largest ... is the Apollo Telescope Mount (atm), which contains five major experiments using eight scientific instruments, all devoted to observing and studying the sun. This complex assembly of solar instruments is designed to be man-operated in a manner similar to a ground-based observatory. The atm is now assembled as part of Skylab, awaiting launch in May 1973. An international campaign of solar observations in 15 countries . . . will be run simultaneously with ATM; a number of sounding-rocket payloads will be launched to help calibrate the instruments on atm and to make complementary observations.” Oso 7, in orbit, “made many unique observations during the August 1972 period of intense solar activity and made the first observations of gamma rays in solar flares, oso-i is planned to be launched late in 1974. It will carry several major experiments to make detailed measurements of the process that transports energy from the sun’s surface to its intensely hot corona. The broad international participation in oso-i is exemplified by a major French instrument and by a group of over 40 guest investigators from the U.S., France, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R.” Associate Administrator for Applications Charles W. Mathews testified on special applications programs: “The Earth and Ocean Physics Applications Program (eopap) is an interrelated series of projects directed to the solution of important problems in earth and ocean dynamics that can best be addressed by the application of space techniques. Major areas of eopap are (a) global monitoring, reporting and forecasting of ocean-surface conditions and (b) monitoring of motions of the whole earth and its crust to obtain a better understanding of the processes that produce earthquakes, with the expectation that this will lead to the development of techniques for predicting the occurrence, magnitude and location of earthquakes.” The second special program underway, the space-processing applications program, was “organized to exploit the unique environment of space flight, weightlessness and unlimited vacuum, for research and technological developments in material sciences and processing with the specific goal of inventing, developing and commercializing new products and manufacturing techniques for use on earth or in space.” NASA’s role was “that of an initiator of new technology and, following a suitable ‘incubation period,’ a supplier of supporting services to a developing area of commercial endeavor.” (Transcript)
Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue—in the 39th day of their mission aboard the Orbital Workshop [see Nov. 16-Feb. 8, 1974]—were participating in new tests developed by nasa scientists and heart specialists at the National Heart and Lung Institute to determine the effects of prolonged weightlessness on the heart, the New York Times reported. Space program doctors wanted data to help explain the smaller heart size, sudden drops in blood pressure when shifting quickly from a prone to upright position, and the smaller output of blood during exercise experienced by astronauts immediately after space flight. The new technique, called echo-cardiography, used sonarlike sound waves of extremely high frequency to produce internal pictures of the heart. The Skylab 4 crew had been tested using echo-cardiography for a week preceding launch. Repeat studies would be made aboard the recovery ship within hours after splashdown. The astronauts would be studied over the course of weeks and possible months to record the complete readaptation of the heart to gravity. (Schmeck, NYT, 12/24/73, 1)
The National Science Foundation published NSF Forecasts Rise in Company-Funded, Research and Development and R&D Employment (nsf 73-301). Company-funded R&D expenditures were projected to increase by 22% between 1972 and 1975, to a record level of $14 billion annually by 1975. A moderate upswing in employment of scientists and engineers on company r&d programs was anticipated. Industrial firms had spent estimated $11.4 billion on R&D during 1972, 7% more than in 1971. Between 1970 and 1971 company-financed r&d rose 4%. Between 1970 and 1972 the number of scientists and engineers employed on company r&d programs rose slightly, to 240 000; an increase to 260 000 was anticipated by 1975. Aerospace firms foresaw future r&d growth below the rest of the industry. The downward trend of employment on company-supported basic research had stabilized; it was expected to rise 10% between 1972 and 1975.

A Wall Street Journal editorial commented on Comet Kohoutek: “The mind can only boggle at how little we still really know about the universe where comets like Kohoutek may number in the billions. Reflecting on this may not lead to any change in our conduct here on earth anymore than the appearance of Halley’s Comet in 1910 seems to have significantly improved earthly conduct. But the implications of Kohoutek, and of the scientific void into which it will soon return, are reminders of the cosmic scope of man’s environment.” (WSJ, 12/11/73) December 12:	NASA test pilot John A.

(Naval Research Reviews, 8/73, 27; nrl pio) July 17:	Skylab Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz testified on the May 14-June 22 Skylab 1-2 mission in a joint hearing before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Conrad said the mission had proved the feasibility of maintaining a large space station for manufacturing in space. “I think the data will show that you can do all the things up there that you can do down here and many of them perhaps better.” Skylab 1-2 earth resources and solar telescope data would show “that eventually space has a very definite role in helping mankind and in solving some of these problems that are in front of us. After all, the Sun is probably the most single efficient nuclear device that we know about. We do have an energy crisis. We need to better understand that. We just scratched the surface with our 30,000 photographs we brought back. I think you will find that the Earth resources data, when coupled with . . . erts [Earth Resources Technology Satellites] and those types of sensors will ... as an overall systems design, tie all of these things we talk about with different satellites into a big picture.” At the mission’s completion the Skylab 1—2 crew could hand over to the Skylab 3 crew a Workshop that could harbor “a 100-percent successful 56-day mission.” Dr. Kerwin said Skylab 1—2 medical experience enabled him to extrapolate a 56-day mission “without difficulty.” He felt the inflight portion would be “a piece of cake.” Postflight, the Skylab 3 astronauts might “feel a bit loggier than we did.” But Skylab 1—2 had demonstrated that this was a “minor illness . . . that you get from being 28 days in space and that you can return very rapidly to normal.” Weitz said Skylab’s earth resources survey equipment permitted a more selective data acquisition than that of unmanned erts. “I think we have shown in the past with unmanned satellites that part of the problem is that you have a continuous data flow, not all of which is usable, but all of which must be processed and reduced and analyzed in some form.” With Skylab equipment “we can track point sites” and “be selective . . . pick out specific sites, fields, or a bend in the river, if you want to study silting.” (Transcript)
Unidentified astronomers were quoted as saying Comet Kohoutek was not likely to become visible to the naked eye for at least another week. After it rounded the sun Dec. 28, it would appear in the evening sky after sunset. It might be fragmented by solar gravity and solar radiation with the comet and its tail becoming more brilliant.

Lewis Research Center scientist Stanley G. Young had applied cavitation— erosion of metal by tiny cavities formed by uneven pressure gradients in liquids—to restoring serial numbers obliterated by filing or grinding, NASA reported. In the process, of use to police in identifying stolen property, an ultrasonic vibrator generated very-high-frequency vibrations in water, creating millions of microscopic bubbles. The bubbles struck the metal surface on which serial numbers had been erased, weakening particles that filled the serial number grooves. Conventional methods of restoring serial numbers used chemicals or mechanical processes that might obliterate remaining traces of the numbers. (NASA Release 73-216)

Further cuts #would be dangerously irresponsible and I will veto any bill that includes cuts which would imperil our national security. . . . The arms limitation agreement signed with the Soviet Union last year has at last halted the rapid growth in the numbers of strategic weapons. Despite this concrete achievement, much needs to be done to ensure continued stability and to support our negotiation of a permanent strategic arms agreement. A vigorous research and development program is essential to provide vital insurance that no adversary will ever gain a decisive advantage through technological breakthrough and that massive deployment expenditures will therefore not become necessary. Yet the Congress is in the process of slashing research and development funding below minimum prudent levels, including elimination of our cruise missile and air defense programs. The Trident and B—1 programs, which are critical to maintaining a reliable deterrent into the next decade, are also facing proposals to cut them to the bone.” The President reiterated his request that Congress authorize creation of Dept, of Energy and Natural Resources and “a new, independent Energy Research and Development Administration so that we can make the very best use of our research and development funds in the future.” r&d efforts could produce “the most helpful solutions to the energy problem.” He called for a separate and independent Nuclear Energy Commission.

Apollo 17 astronaut-geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt championed manned space flight in testimony before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1974 NASA authorization hearings: “Man’s unique capabilities in space flight come into play in situations requiring special insight in dealing with complex processes or events occurring over relatively short timespans. This has been most obvious in space in the geological exploration of the Moon, for example, in the rapid and comprehensive collection of samples, photographs, and observational data in the valley of Taurus-Littrow last December. This capacity will also be clear in certain aspects of Earth and solar observation where short-term dynamic processes are involved and in many space laboratory situations where rapid adjustments to changing experimental conditions are necessary. The dynamic range of the human eye and the mind’s capability for rapid visual integration of changing geometry, color, and lighting make up an extremely versatile sensor system. In addition, when combined with experience and training of the man, this system allows for the efficient selection of other sensors pertinent to the problem at hand. By such selection man can intelligently reduce the quantity of data which analytical systems on the ground will be required to sort and treat in detail. This capability for on-the-spot data selection is not a trivial aspect of man’s presence at the data collection point. Probably one of man’s most useful capabilities is the precision by which he can operate, adjust, modify, or repair equipment. There is as yet little competition for man in this area on Earth or in space flight.” (Transcript)
The Subcommittee on International Cooperation in Science and Space of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics published Research and Development Collaboration with the U.S.S.R. and Japan. The report summarized discussions with Soviet and Japanese officials during the Subcommittee’s July visit to the U.S.S.R—U.S. Aeronautical Technology Symposium and Display in Moscow and a subsequent visit to Tokyo. The Subcommittee had found that “although military and space parity had been achieved with the United States, the U.S.S.R. is far behind in virtually all consumer products. There are also glaring weaknesses in certain areas of high technology.” Soviet leaders had accepted the fact that, “if their plans for the massive expansion and improvement of their commercial air transportation system are to succeed within the proposed time frame, assistance will be required from abroad where superior technology exists. We believe the U.S. aerospace industry is the best, though not the only, source for such high technology products, and evidently the responsible Soviet officials think so, too.” As one of the world’s most highly developed technological countries, Japan had “much to offer to any cooperative venture in science or space.” The Subcommittee urged the National Science Foundation to explore possible collaboration with the Japanese government in its Sunshine Project, a proposed large-scale effort to develop new energy sources.

The National Academy of Sciences held its annual meeting and participated with the Smithsonian Institution in a joint program to honor the Copernican Quincentennial. Dr. Philip Handler, NAS President, announced that Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., retiring Secretary of the Air Force, would become president of the National Academy of Engineering in May and that the nae council had voted to sever NAe’s affiliation with NAS. NAS elected 95 new members. During the program devoted to cosmological questions and humanistic aspects of scientific research, Dr. Stephen Toulmin, Provost of the Univ. of California at Santa Cruz, said he had detected a lack of purpose among younger scientists that might be leading to the end of the intellectual era inaugurated by Copernicus. Dr. John A. Wheeler, Princeton Univ. physicist, said the collapse of the universe into a single, great “black hole” with the annihilation of all matter and all physical laws seemed inevitable. Black holes— superdense objects in space—had been predicted as end products of the collapse of large stars when they no longer produced sufficient heat to counter the weight of their own material. Black holes could serve as examples of what would happen if the universe ceased its expansion and began to fall back upon itself. Since its expansion did not have sufficient momentum to continue indefinitely, the universe could reach its maximum size in 40 billion yrs. Dr. Alan R. Sandage of the Hale Observatory said a five percent decrease in the brightness of galaxies for each billion years of their lifetime would alter the calculation and indicate indefinite expansion of the universe, (nas Memo to Press; Sullivan, NYT, 4/26/73; 4/28/73, 48; NYT, 4/26/73, 74; 4/29/73, 47) April 23—26:	The American Physical Society held its annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Dr. Edward H. Teller, Univ. of California physicist and atomic scientist, urged legislation to declassify all Government scientific secrets after one year. He predicted the action would force the U.S.S.R. to take similar action “in maybe 10 years,” because U.S. science and technology would advance faster without secrecy. Naval Research Laboratory scientist Dr. Herbert Friedman said most astronomers who believed that creation began with a “big bang” also believed that at least as much gas and dust had been left behind when the stars were formed as had been consumed in star formation. Recent findings had been that two clouds moved out in opposite directions from an exploding galaxy to form equally shaped spheres and that radio galaxies left wakes as they plowed through space. “In both cases you need great quantities of gas to put enough pressure on the clouds or the galaxies to slow them down. Galaxies moving through empty space leave no wakes or trains behind them.” (W Post, 4/25/73, A3; LA Times, 4/26/73) April 23—27:	A symposium at Lewis Research Center’s Plum Brook Station presented ideas of NASA engineers on new uses by business, industry, labor, other Government agencies, and universities of Plum Brook facilities available because of NASA’s imminent shutdown of the station for budgetary reasons [see March 6].

Among the samples were 11 of solidification (crystal growth performed in the M-518 multipurpose electrical furnace system) and the remains of spiders Anita and Arabella, who died after spinning webs in zero g for the first time. The spiders’ bodies would be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display later in the week, following examination by a student experimenter. Preliminary examination had shown that Arabella died of malnutrition. Anita had died in space of probably the same cause Sept. 15. (msfc Release 73-146)
NASA launched an Areas sounding rocket from Antigua, West Indies, carrying a Goddard Space Flight Center payload to a 56.3-km (34.97mi) altitude. The primary objective was to measure the ozone distribution in the upper atmosphere, monitor anomalous ultraviolet absorption, and to extend the data base for a climatology of stratospheric ozone in the tropics. The launch would collect data for comparison with data from a flyby of an Air Force RB—57 aircraft and the overpass of the Nimbus 4 satellite (launched April 8, 1970). The payload was ejected near apogee and descended on a parachute. The rocket and the instrumentation performed satisfactorily and the experiment was successful. (nasa Rpt srl)
The People’s Republic of China was reportedly developing an intercontinental ballistic missile 20% larger than the largest one in the U.S.S.R., the New York Times said. Administration officials had said the missile was a three-stage, liquid-fueled icbm expected to have a range of 8000 to 11000 km (5000 to 7000 mi). Underground silos were being built at a missile test center west of Peking, a location which would permit the missile to reach major cities and military targets in the U.S. and U.S.S.R. Following the first successful tests, it would take three years before a force of 10 to 30 missiles could be deployed. (Beecher, NYT, 3/4/73, 17) March 4:	Laser beams, computers, and satellites were being used by NASA to gather data over a five-year span for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey to help predict earthquakes along California’s 965-km (600-mi) San Andreas fault.

The discovery that Saturn’s rings appeared to be made of solid chunks rather than of gas, ice crystals, or dust had been made by Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomers, NASA announced. Dr. Richard M. Goldstein and George A. Morris, Jr., had made the first successful radar probes of Saturn, using NASA’s 64-m (210-ft) antenna at Goldstone Station, and had received much stronger bounceback signals than expected. “From our radar results,” Dr. Goldstein had said, “the rings cannot be made up of tiny ice crystals, dust, or gas. Our echoes indicate rough jagged surfaces, with solid material 1 meter (3.3 feet) in diameter or larger. Possibly much larger.” The rings could be a great hazard to any spacecraft sent into them, (nasa Release 73—37)

The U.S. aerospace industry had “weathered the economic storms of recent years” to emerge “a leaner and tougher competitor,” an Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial said. For the first time in years, the industry was seeing “some of the government shackles that restricted its efforts abroad loosened and even active support forthcoming in certain key areas. The sad story of the balance-of-trade deficits and the decline of the dollar have finally shaken the U.S. government out of its economic isolation, and the aerospace industry will benefit accordingly in its increasing export campaign.” (Hotz, Av Wk, 5/28/73, 9)

Mrs. Levy also had heard from tour participant Karl Muller of Mbabane, Swaziland: “It is very pleasing to see that Swaziland is enlisting the aid of satellites in agriculture. The idea of using satellites for detecting forest fires is particularly interesting, since Swaziland has the world’s largest man-made forest.” (NASA Activities, 7/15/73, 116) July 16:	itos-e Improved Tiros Operational Satellite, launched by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, failed to reach orbit after a 10:10 am pdt liftoff from Western Test Range on a two-stage, long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta booster. Early flight data indicated that abrupt cessation of the hydraulic pump output 270 sec after 2nd-stage ignition had caused loss of hydraulic pressure and thrust vector control. The spacecraft tumbled and failed to achieve orbital velocity. Investigation was begun immediately at Goddard Space Flight Center. The meteorological spacecraft had been intended for sun-synchronous orbit to make day and night cloud-cover observations, to make continuous observations of weather features from its synchronous altitude, and to obtain global-scale quantitative measurements of the earth’s atmospheric structure. ITOS-E, which was to have been christened Noaa 3, was the fourth spacecraft in a series of second-generation meteorological satellites. Noaa 1 (itos-a) was launched Dec. 11, 1970, and was operational for nine months. ITOS—B was launched Oct. 21, 1971, but did not achieve orbit because of a Delta 2nd-stage failure. Noaa 2 (itos-d) was launched successfully Oct. 15, 1972, and had been NOAA’s primary operational spacecraft. (NASA prog off)
The Air Force Systems Command announced it had signed a $3 450 000 agreement to initiate a study for the Dept, of the Interior Office of Coal Research on a more efficient method of generating electrical power from coal with less pollution. Electrical energy would be extracted from a high-temperature ionized gas—similar to the flaming exhaust of a rocket or jet engine—by directing it through a magnetic field.

The Skylab 1 Investigation Board appointed to determine the cause of the anomaly that lost the Orbital Workshop’s meteoroid shield and one solar array wing during launch May 14 reported its findings and recommendations to Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator. The Board, chaired by Lewis Research Center Director Bruce T. Lundin, said the most probable cause was inadequate venting of the pressure in a tunnel beneath the shield. Differential pressure buildup in the tunnel had forced the shield away from the Workshop shell and into the supersonic air stream. The shield then broke the tiedowns holding the solar array wings onto the spacecraft. About 10 min into the flight one solar array wing was torn away completely when it was struck by the exhaust plume of the 2nd-stage retrorockets. The remaining solar array wing would not deploy until the astronauts cut the strap which had curled around the wing and penetrated the metal fairing housing the array. The Board had found that “the significance of the aerodynamic loads on the meteoroid shield during launch was not revealed by the extensive review process” and recommended that complex, multidisciplinary systems like the shield “should have a designated project engineer who is responsible for all aspects of analysis, design, fabrication, test and assembly.” There was no evidence that the shield’s design deficiencies had resulted from or been masked by the Skylab management system. “On the contrary, the rigor, detail, and thoroughness of the system are doubtless necessary for a program of this magnitude.” (nasa Release 73-135; Lundin testimony before Sen Com on Aero and Space Sci, 7/30/73) July 14:	Sweden had handed the 25-nation Geneva disarmament conference a list of 925 nuclear weapon tests carried out from World War II through April 25, 425 of them after the August 1963 signing of the treaty banning all experimental nuclear blasts above ground, Reuters reported. The majority of the 425 had been underground tests, but China and France, which did not sign the treaty, had continued atmospheric nuclear testing.

A Saturn IB launch vehicle would boost the Apollo spacecraft and its three-man crew into earth orbit to rendezvous and dock with the Skylab Orbital Workshop (launched May 14), where astronauts would live and work 56 days in space. The countdown was the first for a manned Saturn launch in which the flight crew would not participate with the ICSC launch team in a dress rehearsal. The rehearsal had been eliminated because of the performance record of the Saturn IB and V. The countdown would include a simulated T-zero, ignition, and liftoff with a fully fueled launch vehicle on Complex 39, Pad B. (ksc Release 163-73)
The Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight transmitted Space Shuttle— Skylab, 1973: Status Report (dated January 1973) to its parent House Committee on Science and Astronautics. The report covered the transition from detailed design to development phase of NASA’s shuttle program (in which the first manned flight was planned for 1978) and the updated cost, performance, and status of the Skylab program (to be completed in 1973). The Subcommittee concluded that technology and resources existed for successful development of the NASA configuration for an earth-orbital shuttle and that the shuttle design would permit the total development cost to stay within $5.15 billion and the per-flight operational cost within $10.5 million. Success in meeting this cost was “particularly sensitive” to the cost of the hydrogen-oxygen tanks and an acceptable recoverable and refurbishment cost of the solid-fueled rocket boosters. Space tug development was “of key importance to gaining full utility of the space shuttle.” Development of a low-cost space shuttle system was essential “if the nation is to realize the full benefits of near space in . . . scientific exploration, practical application, and national security.” The Skylab program was within costs projected by NASA for FY 1973. Development schedules were being met “with some problems being encountered in procuring and integrating experiments.” NASA was recommended to consider the possibility of flying Skylab in the 19741976 period and also possible Skylab revisits after the first three manned missions.

U.S.-U.S.S.R. Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (salt) were held in Geneva. (fbis-Sov, 11/19/73, AA1) November 7:	A five-day delay in the launch of Skylab 4, third and final manned Skylab mission, was announced by Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider at a Kennedy Space Center press briefing. The delay was caused by the discovery of cracks in the Saturn IB launch vehicle fins [see Nov. 6], The earliest rescheduled launch time would be 9:27 am est Nov. 15. Director of Launch Operations at icsc Walter J.	Kapryan said the 3.8-cm-long (1.5-in-long) cracks probably were caused by stress erosion—exposure of the material to the elements combined with stress from the weight of the fueled vehicle—and would have caused the breakup of the vehicle at 12 000 m (40 000 ft), where the rocket underwent maximum aerodynamic stress. All eight fins would be replaced. New fins were being shipped from Michoud Assembly Facility for replacement on the launch pad. (Transcript; O’Toole, W Post, 11/8/73, A3)

An era of global scarcity had begun, a Science editorial noted. “The advanced countries are vulnerable in one or more respects.” Japan had been enjoying a boom but needed to import raw materials, fossil fuels, and food. In Mexico people lived under conditions like those of 100 yrs ago, “with a disregard for sanitation,” but with “Coca Cola signs and transistor radios everywhere.” Much of the world was aware of U.S. living standard and gadgets. “They yearn for both, while the population explosion continues. We are soon going to witness dramatic and miserable confrontations of aspirations, expectations, and limitations.” (Abelson, Science, 7/27/73, 303) July 28-September 25:	The Skylab 3 Apollo spacecraft carrying a threeman crew was launched into near-earth orbit, rendezvoused with the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop (launched May 14), and docked with the space laboratory for the second manned mission in the Skylab program. A series of problems threatened to disrupt the mission, but corrective actions and workarounds permitted it to proceed successfully, setting new manned flight records. The astronauts collected significant data in medical experiments, solar astronomy, and earth resources surveys for 59 days before undocking for a safe return to earth Sept. 25. The csm/S-IVB combination was placed in a phasing orbit with 224-km (139.2-mi) apogee and 150-km (93.2-mi) perigee at 10 min 2 sec after launch. Eight minutes later the csm separated from the stage as planned. The galactic x-ray mapping experiment mounted in the instrument unit (iu) was deployed. At 5 hrs 19 min 53 sec after launch the S—IVB/iu deorbit maneuver was commanded, and the stage impacted the predicted Pacific Ocean area after planned maneuvers. During CSM maneuvers to rendezvous with the Workshop, a leak was detected in the CSM reaction control system (rcs) quad B thruster, one of four assemblies of rockets used to stabilize the spacecraft or to change its velocity and also used as a backup for bringing the CSM back from orbit. Analysis indicated the oxidizer valve was stuck open or partially open. Quad B was isolated; analysis showed that all deorbit mission rules could be satisfied. The CSM rendezvoused with the Workshop at 3:38 pm edt on the fifth orbit. Rendezvous, fly-around, and docking were covered by 23 min of TV. The crew entered the multiple docking adapter (mda) at 4:00 pm edt and began Workshop activation, but activation was curtailed because the crew quickly began to feel motion sickness. Lousma was experiencing nausea and Bean and Garriott were uncomfortable. Bean said he and Garriott tended “to be fairly careful of how we move. And since we are moving rather slowly, then it’s taking a little bit longer than we’d planned.” Motion sickness continued the second day, July 29, and the astronauts were taking scopolamine-dexedrine tablets. Bean communicated, “We feel okay, except in the stomach. . . . And our thinking is that we’re not going to be able to work much faster than we are right now. . . . There’s a desire to maybe take a break for an hour or two and get in the bunk and stay still for a while.” Flight Director Neil B. Hutchinson told the press at JSC that extravehicular activity (eva) to install a new sun shield and retrieve and install Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) film probably would be delayed from July 31 to Aug. 1 at the earliest. Four to five hours of work were carried over from July 28 and 29. Still suffering from motion sickness, the astronauts continued Workshop activation July 30 (Mission Day 3). The first EVA was delayed to Aug. 2 and later rescheduled to Aug. 4 to ensure the astronauts’ complete recovery. Activation was completed July 31 (MD-4) and research began as the crew improved slightly. Bean told ground control: “We’re getting better; it’s just taking a little longer than we thought. . . . Everybody feels pretty good between meals. Then mealtime comes, and we’re caught ... in the squeeze. We’re trying to decide whether we ought to eat all we have to ... to keep our strength up, or eat about what we want to, which isn’t very much.” A TV broadcast from the space station July 31 showed minnows for a biomedical experiment swimming in their plastic aquarium in tight spirals and sometimes apparently trying to swim toward the surface, but with their heads pointed straight down. Garriott said, “Apparently they can’t make up their minds which way is up and down, either.” He also turned a spider named Arabella loose in a plastic cage to observe her web-spinning abilities in zero-g conditions. Later in the mission Garriott reported baby minnows hatched in space performed in water “as if they’d already adapted while they were still in the egg.” They “felt right accustomed to zero-g.” August 1-September 24:	Bean told ground controllers after breakfast Aug. 1 (MD—5) : “This is the first morning we’ve been up here . . . that after a meal everybody felt good. Everybody feels real good right now. Best since we’ve been here.” During live TV the astronauts ate a hearty lunch to music. Bean demonstrated his proficiency in eating while hanging upside down. A medical briefing below at Johnson Space Center suggested that moving quickly from the confined cm to the large Workshop might have contributed to the motion sickness. The milder nausea experienced on the May 25—June 22 Skylab 2 mission could have been caused by a more gradual transition into the Workshop. “I think that it is merely a matter of room in which you can exercise your vestibular mechanisms, and that the workshop simply presents more of that space. . . . perhaps it was too much too soon.” On Aug. 2 a master alarm buzzer awakened the astronauts at 6:45 am EDT. Pressure and temperature were falling rapidly in the CSM reaction control system quad D because of an oxidizer leak. Because of quad B’s July 28 leak, only A and C of the four quads remained fully operational. The quad D leak lasted two hours, losing an estimated 5 kg (12 lbs) of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. Apollo Flight Director Glynn S. Lunney said at a morning press briefing that the spacecraft was flyable with the loss of the two quads but “it would be flown in a mode which is not entirely standard.” The main concern was “that we have had two problems which are related, at least they seem to be related.” A flaw common to the whole RCS could necessitate the crew’s immediate return to the earth or accelerated preparation of the Skylab 4 spacecraft to make it available as a rescue vehicle should the CSM become unusable. Full activation of Skylab-rescue-vehicle preparation was authorized. Launch and checkout crews began working a 24-hr-day, 7-day-week schedule, preparing two additional couches and other equipment for installation. Earliest possible date for a rescue mission was established as Sept. 5. The EVA rescheduled for Aug. 4 was again postponed, for 24 to 48 hours to free the crew for system checks, to free ground controllers to troubleshoot the problem, and to give time to work out EVA procedures for the new spacecraft configuration. While reentry procedures were being rewritten for the new configuration, the astronauts continued scientific experiments. By the afternoon of Aug. 2 Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., jsc Director, was able to tell the astronauts that troubleshooting the RCS had indicated no apparent generic problem, but two unique quad failures, and there was now confidence that the two remaining quads would ensure attitude control should immediate reentry become necessary. “We’re proceeding ... as if we’re going to have a normal mission.” Astronaut Bean replied: “Fine. You just said the right words. . . . we’re pretty happy with the way things are going, at the moment . . . and we agree 100 percent with what you just announced. . . . everybody’s happy up here.” On Aug. 3 Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider said at a JSC press briefing that continuing investigation indicated the two quad failures were unrelated and reexamination of reentry capabilities showed three ways of returning to the earth: using the primary service propulsion system, using the RCS with the two operational quads, and using the hybrid RCS in the cm. “We’re feeling considerably better than . . . yesterday morning.” A slowdown was ordered in the emergency rescue preparations. The Apollo cm would be outfitted in a Skylab 4 configuration, with three astronaut couches rather than the five needed for a rescue mission. The slowdown would delay rescue readiness until Sept. 10. Astronauts Bean, Garriott, and Lousma conducted their first full day of experiments and prepared for an earth resources experiment package pass. Garriott held the TV camera at the window to telecast a good view of the U.S. from North Dakota to North Carolina. Later the first of 26 erep passes was made, to gather data for oil exploration, ocean temperatures, mapping, land use surveys, crop inventories, and pollution studies. A master alarm sounded in the CSM Aug. 4, later attributed to a short-circuit in Skylab’s solar telescope system. The short knocked out one of the two TV systems in the atm but did not afFect Skylab’s main power system. Ground crews investigated problems in the primary and secondary coolant systems Aug. 5. One had been slowly leaking since the Skylab 1 launch May 14 and was expected to become inoperative in 16 to 20 days. The secondary loop was thought to have a small leak, begun during the Skylab 2 mission and giving the loop a predicted 60-day lifetime. Possibly additional coolant would have to be carried up by the next manned mission, Skylab 4, but Program Director Schneider said there was “no immediate danger to the crew.” By Aug. 6 evaluations showed that only the primary loop was leaking; the second was sound and could operate for the rest of Skylab 3 as well as for Skylab 4. Flight surgeon Paul Buchanan’s nightly bulletin said Aug. 5 that the crew “continues to report good health and optimistic outlook” and had asked about an increase in their menus “to match their growing appetites.” Fluid intake and output was “optimal.” The first EVA was performed Aug. 6. Garriott and Lousma stepped outside the orbiting laboratory at 1:30 pm edt to install the 3.6- by 7.3-m (12- by 24-ft), paper-thin, aluminized Mylar awning over the Workshop to reflect the sun’s rays away from the spacecraft skin, damaged when the meteoroid shield was torn ofF during the May launch. Garriott, standing in the Skylab’s open hatch, pieced together the two 16.8-m (55-ft) poles from metal sections and handed them to Lousma. Lousma attached them to a bracket to form a “V” over the Workshop. The sunshade was slowly pulled up by a system of pulleys. One rope kept twisting around the poles and the sunshade folds did not straighten immediately, but after four hours—twice the time expected—the sunshade was successfully deployed. Workshop temperatures were lowered before the EVA ended. Astronaut Bean said Garriott and Lousma worked “at a slow and steady pace” and were not tired. Lousma retrieved and replaced film in four ATM experiments, installed two new cameras, removed a door latch from an atm experiment, and fixed the particle-collection experiment to the rim of the atm. Lousma also inspected the two leaking quads in the CSM RCS and looked for coolant leaks. He noted some evidence of micrometeorite pitting but no clues to causes of the malfunctions. The astronauts completed the eva at 8:01 pm edt, after 6 hrs 31 min, surpassing the 3-hr 30-min record set June 7 by Skylab 2 Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., and Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin. Garriott, first solar physicist in space, focused the atm cameras on the sun Aug. 7 for the first time during the mission. TV audiences watched him work at the ATM panel. By Aug. 8 Dr. Lawrence F. Dietlein, jsc Deputy Director for Life Sciences, reported the astronauts were “in excellent spirits and have no health problems.” They had completely recovered from motion sickness. Their weights had stabilized after a loss of 1.8 to 2.3 kg (4 to 5 lbs) each. Data obtained on the rotating chair indicated their sensitivity to motion had lifted. Since deployment of the sunshade, temperatures in the Workshop had dropped to 296 K (74°F). The crew photographed a coronal transient with the ATM camera two hours Aug. 10. It was the first time a transient—protons and free electrons expelled violently from the sun’s limb at a speed of about 312 km (194 mi) per sec, a phenomenon that occurred two or three times a year—had been observed at that range and time resolution. Program Director Schneider announced Aug. 14 that Skylab 3 would continue its full 59-day mission. From analyses of the CSM and Workshop, he had “concluded that there is no imminent need for rescue, and ... we have made the decision to proceed with a normal test flow on an accelerated basis at Cape Kennedy.” Skylab 4 was being prepared for a normal mission but would be available for a rescue mission if necessary. The earliest launch date could be Sept. 25. Schneider said, “We’re reasonably confident that [csm] 117 is a good vehicle.” “Looks like they got a renewed burst of confidence down there,” Bean said when told of the decision. “We feel that way up here.” JSC announced Aug. 21 that the astronauts would install a new “six-pack” of gyroscopes during an Aug. 24 EVA, to replace faulty ones. The six-pack had been carried up on the Skylab 3 cm. Meanwhile the crew continued with experiments, requesting more work Aug. 14 because all had spare time and “you just can’t sleep 8 hours up here.” They photographed tropical storm Brenda Aug. 19 as it moved across theYucatan Peninsula toward the Gulf of Mexico. On Aug. 21 Astronaut Bean discovered and photographed through ATM telescopes what Skylab principal investigator Dr. Robert MacQueen called “certainly one of the biggest solar events” seen on the Skylab missions. Bean said the complex series of events on the solar limb looked “like a big bubble” sitting on the edge of the disc. He observed it with the white light coronagraph and x-ray instruments and reported it to be three fourths the size of the sun. NASA scientists alerted other facilities to make observations from ground instruments and other satellites. Dr. MacQueen said the event might have been caused by an explosion on the back side of the sun. “It was a beautiful event.” The crew “did a fine job.” Schneider announced Aug. 23 (MD—27) that the Skylab 3 crew had been given permission to continue the mission for another seven days. Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, jsc Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, told the press that he saw nothing in the medical data thus far “that would indicate that we could not press on with the mission, and ... we feel we can go the full 59 days as planned.” EVA—2 began at 12:24 pm edt Aug. 24 with am depressurization by Lousma and Garriott. Lousma completed installation of the six redesigned gyros mounted inside the spacecraft by connecting cables to a computer system outside, and the new gyro system was put into operation. The astronauts installed a sail sample on a hand rail to test durability, replaced ATM film, retrieved and stored cassettes from one experiment, and removed the aperture door ramp latch from two ATM experiments, concluding EVA-2 at 4:31 pm EDT, after 4 hrs 30 min. At 8:01 am edt Aug. 25 (MD—29) the Skylab 3 astronauts surpassed the single-mission endurance mark of 28 days 50 min set in June by Skylab 2. They had completed 404 earth orbits and had traveled 18.5 million km (11.5 million mi). And at 6:11 am edt Sept. 5 (MD-40) Astronaut Bean surpassed the space flight record for one man of 49 days 3 hrs 38 min 36 sec, set in June by Charles Conrad, Jr., on Skylab 2. EVA-3 began at 7:18 am edt Sept. 22. Bean and Garriott moved through space to retrieve and replace atm film and retrieve experiments and parasol samples. EVA operations ended at 9:59 am edt, after 2 hrs 41 min. During the mission, spiders Arabella and Anita first spun webs in corners of their cage, without the normal circular pattern. Each day, however, each improved web formation, adding more radials, adjusting to weightlessness. Garriott said of Arabella Aug. 9 that “she learned very rapidly in zero-g without the benefit of any previous experience.” She “figured out a very nice solution to the problems of zero gravity.” Later ground controllers told Garriott to share his filet mignon with the spiders to keep them alive for the entire mission. Anita, however, was found dead Sept. 16, possibly from inadequate diet. The astronauts righted the cm and remained inside until the recovery ship U.S.S. New Orleans maneuvered alongside and a crane lifted the cm aboard. Immediate medical examinations found the crew in excellent spirits and surprisingly good condition. Blood pressures and heart rates were within normal range. The astronauts would remain aboard ship in San Diego for physical checks and would fly to Houston Sept. 26. They would be quarantined for one week. The Skylab 3 mission achieved its primary objectives of performing unmanned Saturn Workshop operations, reactivating the Skylab orbital assembly in earth orbit, obtaining medical data for use in extending manned space flights, and performing inflight experiments. Despite mission problems, 150% of scheduled atm observing time was accomplished and erep sensors were operated on 39 Z-axis local vertical data runs and 5 solar inertial data runs, completing 218 of the 386 earth resources task sites. All medical experiments were successfully carried out. All but one of the corollary experiments achieved or exceeded objectives. Of 13 student experiments, 9 were completed. Added unscheduled tests and experiments had significantly increased the data yield above premission planning and Skylab was left in an excellent position to complete the final SL-4 mission. Skylab 3 was officially adjudged a success Oct. 11. Major records set by the mission included the longest-duration manned space flight to date, 59 days 11 hrs 9 min; the longest cumulative time in space for one man, 69 days for Bean (who had spent 10 days on the Nov. 14-24, 1969, Apollo 12 mission) ; the longest distance in orbit for a manned mission, 41 000 000 km (25 500 000 mi) ; the longest EVA, 6 hrs 31 min on Aug. 6; and the longest cumulative orbital EVA time, for one astronaut, 13 hrs 40 min for Garriott. In the first mission to man the Orbital Workshop May 15-June 22, Skylab 2 astronauts had conducted medical, solar, and earth resources experiments for 28 days, as well as repairing the Workshop to salvage the mission. The Workshop would be operated unmanned until the November Skylab 4 launch for a third and final mission.

Fletcher, NASA Administrator, praised NASA’s successful efforts to save the Skylab 1—2 mission during testimony before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Science hearing to review the Skylab Investigation Report [see July 13]: “We were able to save Skylab because of the tremendous depth and breadth of the NASA team and the dedication and skills of thousands of people on that team. There certainly isn’t another country that could have reacted as we did. I doubt whether there is another team within this country that could have reacted in this manner. Our team could do it because of years of training, working hard on highly exacting projects, and working as a team to drive toward a technical objective. The performance of the team on the ground, and of course the magnificent performance, skill and courage of the astronauts, saved Skylab. I would hope that this is remembered as the real story of Skylab, not the failure which caused it to happen.” NASA was “taking all the steps we know how to prevent a future failure due to similar causes in other programs.” Director Bruce T. Lundin of Lewis Research Center testified that, throughout six years of reviews and certifications, “the principal attention devoted to the meteoroid shield was that of achieving a satisfactory deployment. Never did the matter of aerodynamic loads on the shield or aeroelastic interactions between the shield and its external pressure environment during launch receive the attention and understanding during the design and review process which in retrospect it deserved.” The omission had not been surprising. “From the beginning, a basic design concept and requirement was that the shield be tight to the tank.” The question of whether the shield would remain tight against the tank under the dynamics of flight through the atmosphere “was simply not considered in any coordinated manner.” Possibly contributing to the oversight “was the basic view of the meteoroid shield as a piece of structure.” No full-time subsystem engineer had been assigned to the shield. “While it is recognized that one cannot have a full-time engineer on every piece of equipment, it is . . . possible that the complex interactions and integration of aerodynamics, structure, rigging procedures, ordnance, deployment mechanisms, and thermal requirements of the meteoroid shield would have been enhanced by such an arrangement,” (Testimony)
The National Science Foundation published Federal Funds for Research, Development and Other Scientific Activities, Fiscal Years 1971, 1972, and 1973 (nsf 72-317). The FY 1973 budget had indicated an upward trend since 1970 in Federal research and development support. The Federal r&d obligation total was expected to rise from $15.5 billion in FY 1971 to an estimated $16.8 billion in FY 1972 and to an all-time high of $17.8 billion in FY 1973. Of the $970-million increase in R&D obligations scheduled for FY 1973, the Dept, of Defense accounted for $400 million and NASA and the Atomic Energy Commission $67 million each.

Creation and detection of antitritium—the counterpart of heavy, radioactive, hydrogen isotope tritium—was reported in the Soviet press by a Soviet scientific team using the U.S.S.R.’s largest nuclear particle accelerator at Serpukhov. The New York Times later said the discovery further strengthened the hypothesis that the universe was made up symmetrically of ordinary matter and antimatter. In a joint project of the Soviet Institute of High Energy Physics and the Institute of Nuclear Research, nuclear physicists Valentin I. Petrukhin and Vladimir I. Rykalin and team had examined 400 billion particles over several months before identifying four antitritium nuclei. It was the second identification of an antinucleus at the Soviet accelerator. In February 1970, Soviet scientists had reported the creation of antihelium. The search for antimatter was being spurred by the theory that the mutual annihilation of matter and antimatter might ultimately yield a new form of useful energy.

The April 6 announcement of the discovery of a distant quasar had strengthened the growing theory among astronomers that they had seen the edge of the universe, Walter Sullivan said in the New York Times. The implication was that, as Einstein believed, the universe was finite. “Beyond its expanding volume, . . . nothing exists—not even space, because, in this concept, over such great distances space curves back upon itself.” By determining the rate at which a quasar was flying away from the earth, astronomers could estimate its distance in terms of the time its light had traveled to the earth. The universe appeared to have originated in a “big bang” some 13 billion yrs ago, and the earliest quasars should be visible far enough away for their light to have been traveling earthward for that long. “But looking across vast distances—and hence, far back into time—man can see out only to 12 billion years (in the most distant quasars).” Hale Observatory astronomer Dr. Alan R. Sandage had said that in these quasars astronomers were seeing “the edge of the world.” Astronomers had long suspected the existence of some sort of wall preventing them from seeing quasars in the region beyond 12 billion yrs. “Now it is beginning to look as though the ‘wall’ is real.” (NYT, 4/8/73, 63) April 8-23:	Lunokhod 2 (landed on the moon by Luna 21 Jan. 16) began its fourth lunar day in the Sea of Serenity near the Le Monnier Crater with the activation of its solar battery.

Lunokhod 2 was brought to an area in the eastern part of the crater where a layer of basalt lava was bisected by a fissure 16 km (10 mi) long and i00 m (328 ft) deep in some places, to study the chemical composition and magnetic properties of the lunar rock in the fissure. Ledge rocks aided Lunokhod 2’s movement. The vehicle did not stick in the loose ground and its velocity could be increased. On April 17 the lunar vehicle was halted to replenish electric power reserves before making a complex trip around the fissure.

A need “to shift gears and return to the main line of development in space flight” was underlined by Michael A. G. Michaud in a Spaceflight article: The purposes of space flight “go far beyond our lifetime. Ultimately, our journey away from Earth will determine the future of the human race; this millennial, evolutionary effort must not founder now for lack of a satisfying rationale.” The basic purpose of space flight was “to expand the realm of Man.” Reasons were to challenge human abilities, learn more about the universe we live in, search for extraterrestrial intelligence and prepare for contact with it, develop and test technologies for earth use, stimulate and employ advanced sectors of the economy, improve orbital applications of space technology with immediate benefits, develop and test military technology, and encourage international cooperation. Michaud proposed a medium-term program to the year 2000 to assemble a manned space station in earth orbit, build a base on the moon, land human beings on Mars by 2000, prepare for interstellar flight, search for planets in other systems, and begin the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. A long-term program beyond 2000 would plan to send unmanned probes to the most promising nearby stars, create a permanent colony on Mars, experiment in planetary engineering—possibly on Venus, “where orbiting space vehicles could introduce materials into the atmosphere that might change its composition” —launch the first manned interstellar flights, and communicate with extraterrestrial intelligence.

A real estate boom apparently would replace the space boom with the end of the Skylab program at Cape Canaveral, the Atlantic Journal Constitution said. Layoffs following Skylab’s end would reduce aerospace employment on the Cape to its lowest point in a decade; a total work force of less than 10 000 had been projected for December 1974. But unlike the cutbacks in 1969 and 1970, there was no panic. An influx of retirees from the North and from southern Florida had caused a shortage of homes. Unemployment in Brevard County was down to 4.2%; the area had once led the nation with more than 8% unemployed.

(Witkin, NYT, 12/15/73, 1) By Dec. 19 command and telemetry systems were checked out, the memory of the onboard computer was loaded and read out, and the tape recorder, atmosphere density accelerometer, and cylindrical electrostatic probe were switched on. All spacecraft systems were checked out by Dec. 20 and were functioning normally. Experiment instrumentation checkout would be completed by Dec. 31. The Explorer 51 mission would consist of two phases. During Phase 1, excursions would be made at two- to four-week intervals, each lasting several days. The spacecraft perigee would be lowered in steps through a range of 150 to 125 km (95 to 80 mi). At each perigee step, telemetry data would be acquired. Phase 2 would begin after eight months and last four months; the spacecraft would be placed in a series of circular orbits ranging between 250 and 800 km (155 and 500 mi) in altitude. Explorer 51 carried 14 scientific instruments provided by a research team of scientists from nine institutions. In addition to the investigation of solar uv activity, the instrumentation would examine particle fluxes, airglow intensities, plasma densities, and temperatures and magnetic fields at low altitudes. To use the full spacecraft and instrument capabilities, a new rapid-response data system would provide data reduced to physical parameters, allowing the spacecraft to operate as a laboratory-in-space periodically reprogrammed to make optimum measurements in the light of interim results rather than gathering data in predetermined modes.

Because of the new discovery and the subsequent necessary examinations and evaluations of other susceptible sections of the rocket, Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider announced at a KSC press briefing a further postponement of the Nov. 15 launch. A new launch date would be set after the situation was assessed. Director of Launch Operations Walter J. Kapryan said that the newly discovered cracks might have been the “result of residual stresses left in the forgings from the fabrication process.” (Transcript)
The Thor-Delta launch vehicle and “its entire missile launch system” were being sold to Japan by McDonnell Douglas Corp., Director Andrew Eiemiller of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (afl-cio) Dept, of Legislation said in testimony before the House Committee on Finance’s Subcommittee on International Trade. Eiemiller told the Subcommittee that the U.S. aerospace industry, “where the U.S. has held technological supremacy,” was “steadily being exported abroad.” Dept, of State spokesman Charles W. Rray, III, later told the press in Washington that the sale had been approved under a 1969 agreement on space cooperation. Japan would be obligated to use the rocket system for peaceful purposes only. (CR, 3/6/73, S3977-9; Doder, W Post, 3/7/73, A10)
NASA launched two sounding rockets. An Areas from Antigua, West Indies, carried a Goddard Space Flight Center meteorological experiment to measure ozone distribution in the upper atmosphere, monitor anomalous ultraviolet absorption, and extend the data base for a climatology of stratospheric ozone in the tropics. The launch was in conjunction with an overpass of the Nimbus 4 satellite (launched April 8, 1970), hut the mission was unsuccessful because of the rapid fall rate, caused by abnormal parachute performance, and because of the lack of radar track. (NASA Rpt SRL) An Aerobee 200A from White Sands Missile Range carried a Univ. of Hawaii solar physics experiment to a 228.4-km (141,9-mi) altitude. The rocket performed satisfactorily but, because of failure of the solarpointing-attitude reaction control system, the experiment was unsuccessful. (gsfc proj off) November 24:	A Washington Post editorial criticized NASA’s dismissal of Mrs. Ruth Bates Harris [see Oct. 26]: “nasa has compiled a dismal record with respect to female and minority employment. Dr. Fletcher himself admits as much. The question is, what to do about it? Dr. Fletcher says that every effort is being made to correct the problem. By now NASA should have learned that institutionalized sexism and racism give way to neither simple pieties nor eloquent declarations of principle. Achieving equitable employment opportunities for women and minorities in large American institutions requires skill, determination and sustained effort, just as a successful space program does. That is a lesson for the 1970s that all major American institutions must learn if the tragedies of the 1960s are to be avoided in this country’s future.” (W Post, 11/24/73, A14)
The U.S. defense outlay continued to increase despite improving relations with the U.S.S.R. and the People’s Republic of China, the U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreement to limit strategic arms, the Vietnam cease-fire agreements, and sharp cutbacks in U.S. military forces, the Wall Street Journal noted. FY 1974 spending was projected at $79 billion, up $4.2 billion from FY 1973, “a shade above the Vietnam-war peak and a shade below the World War II pinnacle. While the White House talks detente, the Pentagon speaks of growing Soviet military power and the likelihood, given further price and pay inflation, of $100 billion-plus military budgets by the end of the decade.” (Levine, WSJ, l/Yl/73, 1) July 17—18:	NASA launched a series of 26 meteorological experiments on rockets and balloons from Wallops Station to provide an in-depth com> parison between remote sensors on satellites and sensors on rockets and balloons from a mid-latitude site. The project—divided into a day and night series to provide data both with and without solar energy input—• was conducted in conjunction with Nimbus 5 (launched Dec. 10, 1972) and Noaa 2 (launched Oct. 15, 1972) satellites. Four Nike-Cajun sounding rockets were launched carrying Goddard Space Flight Center acoustic grenades to measure temperature and winds. The grenades were ejected and detonated in flight, one at a time, from 30- to 95-km (19- to 59-mi) altitude. The first Nike-Cajun was launched July 17 and reached an altitude of 117.4 km (72.9 mi). The rocket performed satisfactorily. Thirty of the thirty-one grenades were successfully detonated and the sound returns were received by the ground microphone array. The second Nike-Cajun launched 79 minutes later reached an altitude of 116.2 km (72.2 mi) and detonated all of its 12 grenades successfully. The third Nike-Cajun was launched July 18 to a 114.9-km (71.4-mi) altitude. Rocket performance was satisfactory and all 31 grenades were successfully detonated. The final Nike-Cajun was launched two hours later to an altitude of 120.7 km (75 mi). The rocket performance was satisfactory and all 12 grenades were detonated successfully. In addition to the Nike-Cajuns, the launches included 4 balloonsondes, 3 Viper Darts, and 15 Super Lokis instrumented to obtain density and temperature data. Participating in the program with Wallops Station were White Sands Missile Range, the Air Force, and GSFC. (WS Release 73-7; nasa Rpts srl)

Several U.S. correspondents had been permitted by the U.S.S.R. to visit the Soviet cosmonaut training center at Zvezdny Gorodok (Star City) near Moscow, Time magazine reported. Time reporters included in the tour had quoted Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training, as saying that similarities rather than differences predominated in the U.S. and U.S.S.R. approach to manned space flight. The similarities included a preference for jet pilots as spacecraft commanders; “training is shaped by requirements, just as the shape of the aircraft is decided by its speed.” Shatalov had recalled Watching Skylab astronauts practicing in a simulator. “It was the same as we simulate here, not more, not less. We are treading the same paths.” [Time, 7/9/73)
The People’s Republic of China was preparing to deploy the first group of 10 nuclear missiles capable of reaching U.S.S.R. targets, Joseph Alsop reported in Washington Post. U.S. intelligence agencies had observed missile sites carved into mountain sides and believed the new intermediate range missile had already been successfully tested. (W Post, 1/17/73, January 17—19:	A Skylab simulation at Manned Spacecraft Center picked up the Skylab flight plan in the 10th day of the mission scheduled for April 30 launch. Flight controllers worked in shifts to tally the day’s activities, prepare a summary flight plan for the day following, and complete a detailed flight plan for use the next day. Activities included all elements of flight between 8 am and 5 pm each day but were oriented toward experiments rather than flight operations. Skylab astronauts manned crew simulators, principal investigators manned support stations, and the Marshall Space Flight Center Operations Support Center for Skylab provided support for the Orbital Workshop. Prime contractors North American Rockwell Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. supported the simulation, msc controllers inserted simulated malfunctions to exercise procedures and mission rules for the flight and to observe the reaction of control teams, (msc Roundup, 1/19/73, 2) January 18:	The European Space Research Organization Council met in Paris and unanimously authorized establishment of a project to develop the sortie laboratory to fly with nasa’s space shuttle in the 1980s.

A Washington Evening Star and Daily News editorial commented on the U.S. stake in the Skylab missions, endangered by damage to the Sky-lab 1 Workshop during launch May 14: “Even if the present Skylab must be written off, the nation should not dismantle its unique capacity for manned space exploration. We have the equipment, including the Saturn V rocket, to mount another attempt in 15 months or so. More importantly, NASA currently has the brains and knowhow to operate in space with amazing powers of foresight and improvisation, which are being put to a severe test this week. The dispersal of this talent would be a loss to mankind in ways that can only be imagined.” (W Star & News, 5/24/73, A18) May 24-June 3: The 30th and largest Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport, marred by tragedy at its end, featured the first joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. pavilion—displaying models of Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft to be used in the July 1975 joint mission—and a record display of aircraft, subsystems, and equipment from manufacturers in 19 countries. The aircraft included the Anglo-French Concorde and Soviet production model Tu-144 supersonic transports, U.S. prototype Northrop F-5E international fighter and Grumman Navy F-14 variable-geometry air-superiority fighter, Soviet I1-62-M medium-range transport and Yak general-aviation aircraft, and the first European A-300B Airbus. nasa Associate Deputy Administrator Willis H. Shapley said at the opening of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. exhibit that NASA was “pleased to have the opportunity to demonstrate . . . the rapid progress our joint working groups have made. . . . During the past year, American and Soviet engineers have worked closely together in an atmosphere of good will to solve many complicated and technical problems. We are confident that the target date for a joint mission in Earth orbit in 1975 can be met. This joint mission will be an exciting adventure as well as a highly visible expression of our nation’s belief in the great value of exploring and using space in cooperation with other nations.” On May 30 the Apollo 17 Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, and Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt met with Soviet Cosmonauts Aleksey A. Leonov, Valery N. Kubasov, and Anatoly V. Filipchenko— of the U.S.S.R. prime and backup crew for the Apollo-Soyuz mission— and Dr. Aleksey S. Yeliseyev at the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Pavilion. They inspected a model of the Soviet Lunokhod 2 lunar roving vehicle and Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft models and were invited aboard the Soviet Tu-144 supersonic transport by its principal designer Gen. Aleksey A. Tupolev. On June 3 the Tu-144 crashed into the French village of Goussainville, near Le Bourget Airport, while finishing a series of demonstration flights. All six crewmen, including pilot Mikhail Kozlov, and seven persons on the ground were killed and 28 injured. The aircraft was destroyed. A team of French and Soviet officials was appointed immediately to investigate the accident, which observers said might have resulted from attempted aerobatics. Witnesses said the Tu-144’s performance had been erratic just before it crashed. {Av Wk, 5/28/73, 6/4/73, 6/11/73; Shapley text; Tass, fibs-Sov, 6/1/73, F5; 6/4/73, F3) May 25:	Skylab 2 was launched from Kennedy Space Center Complex 39, Pad A, on a two-stage Saturn IB launch vehicle to carry Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Dr. Joseph P.

A suggestion that quasars, mysterious bright light sources and radio waves, might be part of galactic evolution was made by Dr. Jerome Kristian, Hale Observatory astronomer, in a telephone interview with Reuters News Agency. Using photos taken through a 508-cm (200-in) reflector, Dr. Kristian had located quasars at the heart of six galaxies by a complex series of calculations of brightness and darkness. “The observations are consistent with the hypothesis that all quasars occur in the nucleii of giant galaxies.” If quasars were part of the process of the development of galaxies, “then it could mean they are the start of the galaxies.” (Reuters, B Sun, 2/3/73, A3) February 4:	India launched a two-stage Indian-made Centaur sounding rocket from Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (terls) to an altitude of 148 km (92 mi).

The National Science Foundation released Resources for Scientific Activities at Universities and Colleges, 1971 (nsf 72—315). Scientists in research and development declined 1% per year between 1969 and 1971 from an annual growth rate of 6% from 1965 to 1969. Teaching staff growth rate remained at about 10% per year 1965-1971. R&D scientists dropped from 26% of the total teaching staff in 1965 to 20% in 1971. The increase of graduate students working on R&D projects fell from an annual rate of 8% 1965-1969 to 2% 1969-1971. Science expenditures in 1970 totaled $7.9 billion—an increase of 6% per year over the $7.0 billion in 1968. The 1964-1968 annual growth rate was 15%. Federal financing of R&D leveled off to a 3% increase per year in 1968 to 1970, but recent data indicated a higher rate of increase in Federal obligations to colleges and universities for FY 1972 and FY 1973. (Text) April 3-May 28:	The U.S.S.R. launched unmanned Salyut 2 scientific space station from Baykonur Cosmodrome into orbit with 260-km (161.6-mi) apogee, 215-km (133.6-mi) perigee, 89-min period, and 51.6° inclination. The Soviet news agency Tass announced objectives were to perfect design, onboard systems, and equipment and to conduct scientific and technical experiments in space flight. Tass said systems were functioning normally. Western observers speculated that a manned spacecraft would be launched to dock with Salyut 2 and establish a manned orbital workshop, resuming Soviet manned space flight after a two-year hiatus. The large Soviet tracking ships Gagarin and Komarov had been sighted in March moving from the Black Sea toward positions in the Atlantic Ocean. On April 11 Tass confirmed earlier U.S. press reports that Salyut 2 had been maneuvered into a higher orbit. April 4 and 8 maneuvers had raised it to a 296-km (183.9-mi) apogee and 261-km (162.2-mi) perigee, with an 89.8-min period and a 51.6° inclination. Stable radio communication was being maintained and the “improved design of onboard systems and instruments” was being tested. Tass said systems and instruments were functioning normally. The new orbit, out of normal range of a manned Soyuz spacecraft, indicated to some observers a holding orbit because of delay in launching cosmonauts to join the station. Tracking data showed an increase in the number of fragments following the spacecraft after April 14. By the end of the month Goddard Space Flight Center listed 27 objects, of which 25 had reentered the atmosphere. On April 18 Moscow sources said the U.S.S.R. had no plans for a manned flight to link with the space station and that Salyut 2 was carrying out experiments in connection with the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz mission planned for 1975. Earlier Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of the cosmonaut training project, had said Salyut laboratories could gather information for weather forecasting, geology, transport, communications, agriculture, and environmental protection— without mentioning manned flight. By April 25 U.S. observers suspected that an April 14 failure, possibly an explosion or a wildly firing thruster, had sent the station tumbling end over end, tearing off the four solar panels and damaging the compartment, making cosmonaut manning of the station impossible. Radio signals from Salyut 2 were reported to have ceased. On April 28 Tass reported that Salyut 2 had “concluded the programme of flight” and that the data obtained in the experiments confirmed “the correctness of design and structural decisions and the properties chosen for the main systems and on-board equipment of the station. These data will be used in building a new spacecraft.” The spacecraft reentered May 28. Salyut 1, the world’s first experimental orbiting workshop, had been launched April 19, 1971. A three-man crew—launched aboard Soyuz 10 April 23, 1971—had docked with Salyut 1 but did not board, returning to earth after two days in space. Three more cosmonauts—launched on Soyuz 11 June 6, 1971—docked, boarded the station, and conducted scientific experiments for 23 days. During their return to earth in Soyuz 11 June 30, they died after a valve accidentally opened and evacuated the air from the spacecraft compartment. A second Salyut was believed by Western observers to have been launched in July 1972 without achieving orbit, (gsfc SSR: 4/30/73; 5/23/73.

Foster, Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering in the Dept, of Defense, testified that dod space shuttle efforts were being expanded, during NASA FY 1974 authorization hearings before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. A program memorandum on dod shuttle use, to be coordinated with NASA, would include plans for early entry into the shuttle program, identify key dod planning milestones, and treat funding and management issues. dod would “place increased emphasis on new concepts of payload design and operation . . . essential to achieving the Shuttle’s full potential for more effective, less costly space operations.” Goals of dod planning and coordination were to ensure that NASA knew and understood dod needs so that the shuttle would be of maximum utility to dod, to provide data essential to integrated planning and support decisions on future shuttle use, to explore ways to benefit most from the shuttle’s unique capabilities, and to coordinate dod shuttle activities with NASA to the best possible use of both agencies. The dod Shuttle-User Committee had been established as “a focal point for our broad and varied interests in the future military use of space.” The Committee, under Air Force chairmanship, included representatives of other military departments and the Joint Chiefs of Staff; NASA would be invited to provide an observer. The Committee would guide studies of payloads and missions, explore the transition from launching dod payloads with expendable vehicles to using the shuttle, and possibly would identify experimental dod payloads to be carried on shuttle research and development flights for NASA. DOD’s FY 1974 space program budget request of $1.6 million, $205 million more than in FY 1973, would reduce the vulnerability of the Transit navigation satellite system; procure spacecraft and boosters for the Fleet Satellite Communications (fltsatcom) System and the Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs) ; cover research and development costs of early-warning general support; and increase supporting r&d for the space test program, for advanced surveillance technology for earth-limb-measurement satellites, and for a joint-service navigation satellite experiment. FY 1974 funding for procurement of early-warning satellites and boosters had been reduced. (Transcript)

After a 25-min coast, a 130-sec burn of the Centaur engines injected the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit that would allow Mariner 10 to pass within 5300 km (3300 mi) of Venus Feb. 5, 1974. Using the gravitational field of Venus to change the speed and flight path of the spacecraft, Mariner 10 would travel toward a March 29 encounter with Mercury, approaching the sun more closely than any other planetary mission. Mariner 10 would be the first spacecraft to use gravity assist in a dual-planet mission and the first to explore Mercury. The primary objective was to measure Mercury’s environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the interplanetary medium and to obtain experience with a dual-planet gravity-assist mission. PRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED! The seven experiments aboard the octagonal 503-kg (1108-lb) spacecraft included a TV camera and an infrared radiometer to investigate the planet’s surface; plasma science experiment, charged particle telescope, and magnetometer to investigate the environment around the planet and the interplanetary medium; dual-frequency-radio science experiment and ultraviolet spectrometer to measure characteristics of the Mercury neutral atmosphere and ionosphere if they existed; and celestial mechanics experiments to measure planetary mass characteristics and test the theory of relativity. All experiments had been designed and selected for their Mercury scientific objectives but also would obtain important data at Venus and during the cruise phases. The Tidbinbilla, Australia, tracking station was unable to maintain command lock with the spacecraft following spacecraft injection. Acquisition of the star Vega by the spacecraft Canopus tracker also was delayed, but two-way communications were established within an hour and, after repeated commands, Vega was acquired. Solar panels, high-gain and low-gain antennas, and plasma science and magnetometer booms were deployed. On Nov. 4-5 four moon and three earth TV picture mosaics were completed. By Nov. 6 the spacecraft was 1 394 000 km (866 000 mi) from the earth, traveling at a speed of 4.32 km (2.68 mi) per sec. All science experiments except the infrared radiometer and electrostatic analyzer had been turned on. The scanning electron spectrometer portion of the plasma science experiment was not operating properly and the problem was being analyzed. Four trajectory correction maneuvers were scheduled during the mission. The first, Nov. 13, successfully adjusted the flight path for closest approach to Venus on Feb. 5, 1974, as planned. A second would be made Jan. 18, 1974. On Feb. 9 and March 1, 1974, after the Venus encounter, maneuvers would target the Mariner 10 to pass Mercury at 1000-km (620-mi) altitude. The Mariner program, including mission operations and tracking and data systems, was managed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory under the direction of NASA’s Office of Space Science. Lewis Research Center, with contractor General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., was responsible for the launch vehicle. Previous missions had been made to Mars, including Mariner 4, 6, 7, and 9 (launched Nov. 28, 1964; Feb. 24, 1969; March 27, 1969; and May 30, 1971). Mariner 9 had been the first spacecraft to orbit a planet other than the earth. All others had been flyby missions. (nasa prog off; jpl Release 673) November 3—January 9, 1974:	NASA’s Pioneer 10 interplanetary probe (launched March 2, 1972) became the first spacecraft to reach Jupiter during a two-month encounter, returning new findings about the giant planet and continuing toward Uranus and eventual exit from the solar system. November 3—December 3:	Encounter operations were begun Nov. 3 by Ames Research Center controllers and scientists and on Nov. 4 Pioneer 10 began sending photopolarimeter images of Jupiter to the earth three to eight hours a day. By Nov. 6 the spacecraft, 25 000 000 km (15 500 000 mi) from Jupiter, had begun measuring the placet’s atmosphere above Jupiter’s orange-and-blue-striped cloud tops and the characteristics of particles making up the dense clouds. On Nov. 8 the spacecraft crossed the orbits of Hades and Poseidon, the first two of Jupiter’s outer moons, and on Nov. 9 and 11 it crossed the orbits of Pan and Andrastea. At a Nov. 19 press briefing at arc Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science, said that low temperature in that area of the solar system slowed evolution and scientists hoped to find objects not very different from what they were at their formation. “The passage of Pioneer 10 past Jupiter also marks the gateway to the exploration of the outer solar system. This is an exploration which is critical if we truly want to understand the formation and evolution of our solar system.” Dr. William H. Kinard, Langley Research Center scientist, said that Pioneer 10 had encountered 100 times more space dust than expected during the journey between the Asteroid Belt and Jupiter. He expected that 30 times more particles would be detected as the spacecraft neared Jupiter. Pioneer 10 crossed the orbits of Jupiter’s moons Demeter, Hera, and Hestia Nov. 22 and was 11400 600 km (7 084 000 mi) from Jupiter. By Nov. 25 a charged particle detector aboard the spacecraft had begun to show traces of particle radiation. Preliminary indications were that the probe was beginning to cross into Jupiter’s magnetosphere, estimated to be 20 times stronger than the earth’s. The planet’s radiation belts contained particle concentrations up to 1 million times higher than the earth’s Van Allen Belt and were considered by some scientists to be extremely dangerous to the spacecraft’s electronics. At a distance of 8 336 400 km (5180 000 mi) from Jupiter, spacecraft instruments began returning pictures of Jupiter’s great red spot. The final spacecraft-attitude change before encounter was made Nov. 26 and a 24-hour day of imaging and polarimetry began. At 3:30 pm EST Nov. 26 Pioneer 10 successfully crossed Jupiter’s bow shock wave at a distance of 7 709 000 km (4 790 000 mi)—with great turbulence when the solar wind hit Jupiter’s magnetic field. The spacecraft was unaffected by the turbulence hut data from 6 of its 11 instruments changed dramatically. Solar wind speed abruptly decreased to half the normal velocity and solar wind temperatures rose sharply. On Nov. 27, at a distance of 6 760 000 km (4 200 000 mi) from Jupiter, the spacecraft crossed into the planet’s true magnetic envelope, the region of interplanetary space into which the solar wind could not penetrate. Pioneer 10 crossed the magnetopause, entering the magnetic field for the first time at 3:30 pm est. At a Nov. 29 press briefing arc scientists said new data had shown the reach of Jupiter’s magnetic field to be greater than predicted. It stretched more than 13 000 000 km (8 000 000 mi) in diameter and its strength was 40 times that of the earth’s ma'gnetic field. Its direction was south, rather than north as predicted. The strength of the magnetism at 6 400 000 km (4 000 000 mi) from the planet seemed to rise and fall in a regular 10-hour phase, possibly because of the planet’s rotation. Jupiter’s mass was also found to be greater than estimated and the spacecraft was being drawn toward Jupiter faster than planned; it would arrive at its closest approach two minutes earlier than predicted. On Nov. 30 Pioneer 10 recorded a sharp drop in magnetic and radiation measurements, indicating disappearance of the magnetic field. Eleven hours later the spacecraft again crossed the magnetopause, which had apparently been driven toward the planet by a disturbance in the solar wind. At 1 427 500 km (887 000 mi) from the planet, the spacecraft entered Jupiter’s dipole magnetic field. Preliminary data indicated that the outer portions of Jupiter’s magnetic field did not rotate with the planet and were more flattened than the earth’s field. Also, the magnetic dipole center was appreciably offset, both radially and toward the north from the center of the planet. The magnetic axis was tilted from the spin axis. Pioneer 10 crossed the orbits of Jupiter’s innermost moons—Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Io—Dec. 2-3. As it came within 446 000 km (277 000 mi) of Ganymede, the infrared radiometer indicated the moon’s surface temperature was 125 K (—235°F). Six hours before its closest approach to Jupiter the probe entered the dangerous region of intense radiation and, soon after, the imaging system ceased returning picture data. Radio commands switched the system back to normal operation within 30 minutes, however. The press later reported that NASA attributed the mishap to an unidentified flight control room guest who had inadvertently pressed against a cathode ray display, pushing a button that cut out eight instruments. December 3—11:	As the gold and silver spacecraft approached Jupiter and radiation intensity increased 10-fold every two hours, reaching 65 million ev 90 min before periapsis, tense scientists paced the floor of arc’s Mission Control with fingers crossed. At 9:25 pm est Dec. 3, after a flight of 641 days and 826 000 000 km (513 000 000 mi), Pioneer 10 sped past Jupiter at an altitude of 130 000 km (81 000 mi), traveling 155 140 km per hour (96 400 mph), the fastest speed ever achieved by a man-made object. The spacecraft’s 11 instruments sent back readings and pictures that came in loud and clear, taking 46 minutes to reach a jubilant team on earth. “Needless to say, we’re elated,” Dr. John Wolfe, Pioneer Project Scientist, told cheering newsmen. The Washington Post later described the scene at arc: “So deluged were Pioneer scientists with transmissions of the spacecraft’s instruments, they were literally changing their minds about Jupiter’s physics and chemistry every hour.” Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said, “Some of us have been looking through telescopes at Jupiter since our early teens. This is more than we ever dreamed of.” The spacecraft suffered no apparent failures and continued to function as planned. However, preliminary estimates of radiation belt parameters and observed effects on the spacecraft and instrumentation indicated that the margin of survival had been small. As Pioneer 10 flew by Jupiter, the spacecraft was accelerated and slung by the planet’s gravity into a new trajectory that would take it past the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto and, traveling at a constant 40 000 km per hr (25 000 mph), out of the solar system toward the constellation Taurus. Pioneer 10 would be the first spacecraft to leave the solar system. By 7:00 pm EST Dec. 4, it had traveled nearly 1600 000 km (1000 000 mi) beyond Jupiter. December 11—January 9:	arc Mission Control ended Jupiter picturetaking Dec. 11 and returned to routine interplanetary operations. The spacecraft recrossed the bow shock wave Dec. 12 and continued into interplanetary space. By Dec. 14 the spacecraft was 10 881000 km (6 761 000 mi) from Jupiter, traveling at 83 525 km per hr (51 900 mph) toward the edge of the solar system. Preliminary findings from the encounter included the discovery of an ionosphere (implying a tenuous atmosphere) surrounding Jupiter’s moon Io, detection of helium in Jupiter’s atmosphere, new density measurements of the entire Jovian system that would affect current theories on the formation of the universe, and new temperature measurements of Jupiter that indicated little difference between average daytime and nighttime temperatures. Pioneer 10 was expected to continue collecting and returning data until it reached the orbit of Uranus in 1980, almost 3 200 000 000 km (2 000 000 000 mi) from the earth. Data returned would determine whether the second Jupiter probe, Pioneer 11 (launched April 5 and crossing the Asteroid Belt since August), could safely be retargeted closer to the planet. The Pioneer 10 mission was officially adjudged a success Jan. 9, 1974. The Pioneer program, begun in 1958, was directed by arc. Pioneer 6 and 7 (launched Dec. 16, 1965, and Aug. 17, 1966, to study the heliocentric space environment) and Pioneer 8 and 9 (launched Dec. 13, 1967, and Nov. 8, 1969, to study interplanetary phenomena) continued to supply data from heliocentric orbit on solar plasma, magnetic and electric fields, and cosmic rays, (nasa prog off; arc Release, 11/6/73; nasa Releases 73-243K, 73-256, 73-279; Wilford, NYT, 11/25/73; 11/30/73, 1; 12/4/73, 1; 12/5/73, 13; O’Toole, W Post, 12/4/73, Al; AP, W Star-News, 11/28-29/73; AP, B Sun, 12/3-4/73; Miles, LA Times, 12/4/73; 12/6/73) November 3:	The Skylab 4 launch crew successfully completed a simulated launch of the Saturn IB booster at Kennedy Space Center.

(faa Release 73-30) February 9—19:	The U.S.S.R. ground control commanded the lunar explorer Lunokhod 2 to unfold its solar battery panel and begin its second lunar day of exploration. The moon car explored its parking area—a small deep crater with outcroppings of bedrock at its edge, formed 3 million yrs ago by a large meteorite that hit the surface of congealed lava. Lunokhod 2 made measurements of the magnetic field inside the crater by approaching it four times from different directions and making 120 precision maneuvers. The vehicle moved southeasterly to the Taurus Mountains. En route it measured physicomechanical properties of the soil and tension of the local magnetic fields, took panoramic photos of surrounding terrain, and tested riding characteristics of the lunar vehicle in various modes of operation. A monolith one meter (three feet) long of unusual lunar material was discovered Feb. 13. The plate had a strong, smooth surface unlike surrounding pockmarked stones and appeared to be much younger. During exploration of the giant crater Lunokhod 2 skidded and swerved over 2.3 km (1.4 mi) of difficult terrain with slopes up to 25° and sank in dust to the hub of its wheels as it ascended the rim of the crater. At the top of the rim, TV cameras showed a complex surface with ejecta piled on the rims of lunar holes formed when three meteorites hit the area within millions of years. Lunokhod 2 descended the slope of a 100-m (330-ft) crater, leaving deep ruts in loose rock. The difficult ascent was interrupted for 20 hrs to replenish electrical energy Feb. 19. Lunokhod 2 had covered 9.6 km (6.0 mi) since landing on the moon Jan. 16. (Tass, fbis-Sov, 2/14/73, LI; 2/15/73, L2-L3; 2/21/73, L2-L3) February 10-March 10:	Water impact and towing tests of the space shuttle’s solid-propellant booster were conducted by the Navy at the Long Beach, Calif., Naval Shipyard. Tests, under Marshall Space Flight Center direction, gathered data on retrieval of reusable solid-fueled-motor casings jettisoned from the orbiter stage at 40-km (25-mi) altitude. Test hardware, a 77%-scale model of the shuttle booster, was dropped from heights of 0.3 to 12 m (1 to 40 ft) at angles of 10°, 20°, and 30° off vertical. The model was towed at speeds of 3.7 to 14.8 km per hour (2.3 to 9.2 mph). Kennedy Space Center was responsible for development of the retrieval techniques; MSFC, for design and fabrication of solid-propellant reusable boosters, (msfc Release 73-12; icsc Release 22-73; NASA prog off) February 11:	Rising costs of the Skylab missions were discussed by Thomas O’Toole in a Washington Post article: Nearly $400 million had been added to cost estimates since the Skylab program had originated seven years ago. Postponement of the first Skylab launch from April to May had added $5 million in overtime costs and NASA had conceded another two-week delay and $5 million in additional costs was possible. Another reason for skyrocketing costs was the post-Apollo switch of emphasis from the moon and planets to the earth. Skylab’s original purpose had been to study the sun and addition of the earth studies program on Skylab had added greatly to costs. Skylab was the flagship of the U.S. manned space program. It was the “most impressive machine ever built,” weighing 90 metric tons (100 U.S. tons) and providing living quarters equal to a three-bedroom house. Scientists saw Skylab as the link between the first decade of space exploration and the 1980s, when the reusable shuttle would become operational. It would provide much information about effects on the human body of long periods in space. The last of three Skylab crews might stay in space for 70 days. “If they make it that long without any serious side effects, they will have done as much for space exploration as any of the pioneers before them.” (O’Toole, W Post, Al) February 12:	A statement by Western Union International, Inc., Vice President Thomas S. Greenish that mainland China had no plans for establishment of a domestic satellite communications system was quoted by Aviation Week & Space Technology.

Since then, four administrations have committed our industrial resources, our technological and scientific capacities and the national will to the proposition that America can and must play a role in outer space equal to its responsibilities as a great nation.” People of all nations stood in awe of NASA’s accomplishments. “The men of NASA have undertaken one of the greatest human adventures with such consummate skill, cool exactness in the face of untold dangers, and professional disdain for the sensational that we have come already to take for granted the legitimacy of man’s place in an environment entirely alien to him. But neither the courage, skill and devotion of the men of NASA, nor the benefits of their efforts, should be taken for granted. In every phase of our national life, new products, new techniques and new understanding have resulted from our efforts in space. And in relations between nations, the prospects for a lasting peace have been enhanced by the now absolute awareness that the primary interests of mankind are identical and shared in common. On the fifteenth anniversary of NASA, we look ahead to the same ordered progress into our space future which has characterized our first tentative steps into space.” (Text)

Fifteenth anniversary of the first U.S. satellite, Explorer /, launched by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and Jet Propulsion Laboratory Jan. 31, 1958. The U.S. and the Western world had entered an age of space with the launch of the 14.0-kg (30.8-lb) stovepipe-shaped satellite. Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center, recalled the mood of excitement surrounding the launch that had followed two successful U.S.S.R. launches and a failure in the first U.S. attempt to launch Vanguard. “I think we were all aware that this wasn’t just another mission—that perhaps the entire world was watching this one.” Explorer I had made significant scientific contribution with the discovery of the Van Allen Radiation Belt surrounding the earth. The satellite had transmitted data until May 23, 1958, when its small batteries were exhausted. It reentered the earth’s atmosphere Mar. 31, 1970. (nasa Release 73—14; icsc Release 17-73)
A planned layoff of 2500 workers—including scientists, engineers, and blue collar personnel—had been announced by Lockheed-California Co., the Associated Press reported. The work force reduction of 9% of the 29 000 employees would follow earlier signing of an agreement with Eastern Airlines, Inc., in which the airline asked for delayed delivery of wide-bodied Lockheed aircraft.

Lunney met with Soviet counterparts in Moscow for two weeks of discussions of technical problems of the joint U.S.—U.S.S.R. mission scheduled for July 1975. Discussions culminated in an Oct. 18 midterm review of the project by Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, and Academician Boris N. Petrov, Chairman of the Intercosmos Council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Dr. Low had arrived in Moscow Oct. 14; his stay included visits to the Institute of Geochemistry, the Institute of Space Research, the Cosmonaut Training Center, and the Space Flight Control Center. In an Oct. 18 communique Dr. Low and Academician Petrov confirmed their satisfaction with the astp project status. All major milestones were being met on schedule and, Dr. Low said, progress made indicated that the scheduled launch date could be met. Soyuz orbital and Apollo docking module drawings had been exchanged and agreement had been reached that U.S. specialists would participate in preflight final checkout of flight equipment at the Soviet launch site. Specialists would be exchanged to fit-check compatible equipment at U.S. and U.S.S.R. launch sites. Academician Petrov told the press that U.S. specialists would be permitted at the Soviet launch site “up to the very minute of launching.” During the visit U.S. officials learned the deaths of three cosmonauts on Soyuz 11 June 30, 1971, were caused by accidental triggering open of an exhaust valve rather than by a hatch leak. The valve tripped open just after the reentry capsule separated from the larger orbiting module in a maneuver including firing of 12 explosive bolts. At least two crew members tried to close the valve but were unable to move fast enough. Unconsciousness from rapid decompression came in less than 10 sec; ground tests showed it would take 27 sec to close the valve by hand. U.S. officials said they were satisfied that subsequent modifications to the valve and crank mechanisms—tested on two unmanned flights, Cosmos 496 and 573, and on the manned Sept. 27-29 Soyuz 12 mission —were sufficient to prevent reoccurrence of the accident.

At a postflight crew press briefing, Skylab 3 Astronaut Alan L. Bean —who had splashed down Sept. 25, after a 59-day mission working in the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop (launched May 14) with crew members Dr. Owen K. Garriott and Jack R. Lousma—said that the crew’s health had been “good the whole time.” Sufficient exercise, meals on time, and plenty of sleep had accounted f or their happiness and well-being. Having a scientist-astronaut aboard had created a “greater variety of interchange around the dinner table,” making “a better mission for everybody.” The mission would have been “50% less productive if Owen had not been there. He added a great amount to it . . . because his point of view is, just different.” Garriott said that a longer mission would necessitate “a somewhat less strenuous program,” but he could have spent eight hours a day at the wardroom window with a camera in each hand and a good supply of film “and never have any tendency to become bored.” Lousma said he still felt “a little less energetic” than before the mission, but within two weeks “I’ll be back to the same condition.” Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, jsc Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, said that the crew was “in very good shape” but still had dizziness with specific head movements. Strength of the flexor and extensor muscles had decreased 20%. The astronauts’ weights were steadily climbing toward their preflight weights. Early blood tests had shown the red cell mass was down an average of 12% for all three crew members. The blood plasma was also down 15% to 20%. In an overview of Skylab 4, the third and final manned Skylab mission, Skylab Program Office Manager Kenneth S. Kleinknecht said that the spacecraft (Command and Service Module 118) and crew members Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue were being readied for Nov. 11 launch. Final decision on the launch date would be made after further evaluation of the mission. In preparation, 140 kg (300 lbs) of operational equipment had been deleted from stowage. It had been replaced with another 150 kg (300 lbs) of operational equipment, 60 kg (130 lbs) for Skylab experiments, and 70 kg (150 lbs) of special equipment for Comet Kohoutek observations. After Oct. 8—10 flight readiness tests, only servicing, stowage, pyrotechnic installations, countdown demonstrations, and launch would remain. CSM—119, the rescue vehicle, was being prepared and would be available for a Jan. 6 launch if needed. Alfred A. Bishop, Manager of the jsc Missions Office, said that, after the first two weeks of acclimation, the Skylab 4 crew would perform 28 man-hours of experiments each day, an increase from the 19 to 221/j man-hours on Skylab 3. The increase would provide an additional 200 experiment man-hours. The crew would observe Comet Kohoutek, perform 12 experiments using the Apollo Telescope Mount, observe Mercury crossing the sun Nov. 10, observe a solar eclipse, and perform 10 to 14 new earth resources experiment package passes.

The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology opened its hearings on the FY 1974 nasa authorization. Rep. Ken Hechler (D-W. Va.), Committee Chairman, said the Subcommittee would be particularly concerned with “the extent of progress toward the enunciation of a national aeronautics and aviation policy.” The Subcommittee had been partially responsible, he said, for the reduction of emphasis on aeronautics because it was “not aggressive enough in its insistence that more emphasis be placed on aeronautics during . . . the late I950’s when the Committee was first established, and the early 1960’s when the tremendous emphasis on space tended to push aeronautics . . . into the background.” Roy P. Jackson, nasa Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology, testified that reorientation of NASA’s space and aeronautical programs to meet changing national goals had been completed “without jeopardizing the continuing development of a broad base for new knowledge, and the potential for meeting future, but presently unseen, needs.” In the oast aeronautics program the research and technology base took priority over experimental programs. The R&T base was “work that is unparalleled in the U.S. It is the data base from which springs new ideas for development in the future.” When faced with the necessity to cut expenditures, “we had to consider primarily a reduction in our work on flight experiments and experimental programs.” Among examples of meeting future needs, hydrogen as a long-term aircraft fuel for the distant future was a “concept of potential major importance to the reduction of air pollution, while simultaneously conserving our increasingly scarce petroleum reserves.” Hydrogen eliminated hydrocarbon pollution and was “a more efficient fuel, but the reduction of NOx [oxides of nitrogen] may require additional effort.” The “earliest likely commercial use of hydrogen as an aircraft fuel will be about 15 to 20 years hence.” Hydrogen was “a low-density, cryogenic fuel which represents problems of relatively large, insulated tanks, the need for materials to keep their strength through wide temperature variations, very low temperature hardware including pumps, valves, seals and associated maintenance. In addition to cost, hydrogen is difficult to store and transport. . . . Our experience with the practical use of liquid hydrogen in NASA’s space program suggests that there will be some complexities to solve but these should not be insurmountable.” Dr. Seymour C. Himmel, Deputy Associate Administrator for Technology in OAST, reported on the quiet, clean, short-haul experimental engine (qcsee) program to integrate and demonstrate technology required for an environmentally acceptable and economical powered-lift propulsion system, “qcsee will utilize a basic existing engine core, modified as required to mate with specially designed low-pressure spool fans and turbines to build up an experimental engine. This, together with appropriate flight-type acoustic nacelles and wing section installations, will be tested for noise and performance and operating characteristics. The design and test program will provide the technology base needed to help guide Government . . . environmental rulemaking and to provide industry with data to evaluate propulsion concept effectiveness and development risks.” George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs in OAST, described the status of aeronautics programs after revisions necessitated by FY 1974 budget restrictions. The General Electric Co. quiet engine contract had been completed and both engines delivered to NASA. Engines A and C were scheduled for extensive in-house research programs at Lewis Research Center. An in-house study underway at LeRC would determine the technical value of another contracted effort, for a second-generation quiet engine. “In the meantime, we are working to generate component noise design and performance data, so that a significant noise reduction below that demonstrated by the first Quiet Engine can be obtained in any future engine program. No important area in aeronautical propulsion has been terminated, although funding levels for certain portions of the aeronautics programs have been readjusted based on a review of priorities. The F-8 high-speed supercritical wing verification project was not cut back or terminated. During FY 1973, the project was completed according to plan. The results were very encouraging and gave confidence as to wind-tunnel test results at transonic speeds.” A follow-on to the F-8 was under study. Depending upon results, a follow-on F-8 flight-test program might be undertaken in FY 1975. (Transcript)
nasa launched a Nike-Tomahawk sounding rocket from Poker Flats, Alaska, carrying a Goddard Space Flight Center magnetospheric physics experiment to a 239.8-km (149-mi) altitude. The rocket and instrumentation performed satisfactorily, (gsfc proj off) During March: A large comet from 16 to 160 km (10 to 100 mi) in diameter was discovered past Jupiter’s orbit by Czechslovakian-born astronomer Dr. Lubos Kohoutek, using a telescope at Hamburg Observatory in Bergedorf, West Germany. Dr. Brian Marsden, Director of the Smithsonian Institution’s Central Telegram Bureau, said later that Comet Kohoutek should reach perihelion, its closest point to the sun— 21 million km (13 million mi)—Dec. 27, “when it should shine perhaps as luminously as the star Sirius.” Its nearest approach to the earth would be 121 million to 129 million km (75 million to 80 million mi) in mid-January 1974. The comet should be visible six weeks before, and northern hemisphere observers should enjoy a good view of it Jan. 10-15, 1974. (Alexander, W Post, 4/15/73, G7)
Experiments by 50 European scientists at the European Nuclear Research Center (cern), near Geneva, had indicated that electromagnetism and the “weak” force of radioactive decay—two of nature’s four basic forces—might be expressions of the same phenomenon, the New York Times reported. The findings had been supported by experiments at the National Accelerator Laboratory near Batavia, 111. If accurate, the findings would support the long-sought goal of a “unified field theory” relating the four seemingly diverse forces, which also included gravity and the “strong” force that bound together particles of the atomic nucleus. (Sullivan, NYT, 10/30/73, 29) NASA and the Dept, of Defense were in the final phase of a joint study to determine the most efficient development method for the shuttle space tug, or upper stage, for high-energy orbit missions. “One consideration is the adaptation of existing stages such as the Agena, Centaur, or Tran-stage, which could be modified for use with the shuttle. Since the modification . . . would not satisfy all of the science, application and DOD requirements that are now projected for the 1980s, we are also examining costs and technical characteristics of new configurations which would have the performance capability required to accommodate the entire range of prospective payloads. It may be possible to phase these two Tug approaches in a way that will provide adequate transportation capability when needed while reducing near-term funding requirements. We . . . expect to reach a final decision by the end of this calendar year.” Dr. Fletcher presented 1973 Payload Model: Space Opportunities 1973—1991, a study of the number and kinds of payloads that could be launched through 1991 with the space shuttle and Spacelab using budgets at the FY 1973 level. The study was not a program plan but an estimate of kinds of payloads that could be flown. Dr. Fletcher felt “the full range of the space capability offered” by the Shuttle was even greater than the model indicated. Anticipated possible annual space payloads for all NASA programs and the user community, excluding DOD, began with 12 in 1973 and moved through 18 in 1974, 38 in 1980 (when the shuttle was to begin its operational phase), 61 in 1985, to 70 in 1990 and 59 in 1991. The 70 payload opportunities in 1990 included 21 automated and 27 sortie (Spacelab) payloads for nasa and 17 automated and 5 sortie for non-NASA, non-DOD users. Anticipated requirements through 1991 totaled 810 payloads, 572 for nasa and 238 for non-NASA, non-DOD users, nasa and other non-DOD agencies were expected to use 69% of the shuttle traffic and dod 31%. The model anticipated NASA automated payloads through 1991 might include 77 for astronomy, 43 for physics, 49 for planetary exploration, 8 lunar, 26 life science, 53 earth observations, 22 earth and ocean physics, 2 communications and navigation, and 6 space technology. Anticipated user totals were 120 automated communications and navigation payloads, 59 earth observations, and 9 earth and ocean physics. Possible nasa sortie payloads were forecast at 58 in astronomy, 52 in physics, 24 in earth observations, 43 in space processing, 24 in earth and ocean physics, 11 for communications and navigation, 28 in life science, and 46 in space technology. User sortie payloads might be 10 for space manufacturing and 40 foreign payloads.

Tass reported that Cosmos 605 carried white rats, steppe turtles, insects, fungi, and instruments to monitor their condition. Objectives of the mission were to study the effects of space on living organisms and to test life-sustaining systems for biological subjects. The spacecraft was recovered Nov. 22. Dr. Avetik I. Burnazyan, U.S.S.R. Deputy Minister of Public Health, said in a Pravda article on Nov. 9 that the satellite was a continuation of earlier Soviet experiments designed to gain statistically reliable data on the effects of weightlessness on individual cells of organisms and the effects of radiation on the genetic properties of organisms. Previous Soviet biological satellites included Cosmos 110 (launched Feb. 22, 1966, carrying two dogs for a 22-day mission) and Cosmos 368 (launched Oct. 8, 1970, carrying yeast cells, seeds, and onion bulbs all of which were exposed to radiation during a 6-day mission).

The House attitude toward solar energy as a factor in relieving the energy crisis was discussed in a Washington Post guest column by Rep. James W. Symington (D-Mo.), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications, and Rep. Mike McCormack (D— Wash.), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, both of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Members of the subcommittees had expressed the urgent need for an accelerated program in solar energy research and development and had encouraged NASA and the National Science Foundation to use funds provided to develop “an expanded, mission-oriented program.” But they warned against expecting that solar energy would provide any significant relief from the energy crisis during the immediate future: “We cannot emphasize strongly enough that this nation must depend primarily upon the combustion of coal, gas, and oil, and on nuclear fission, for energy for the balance of this century. No amount of enthusiasm for solar energy, and no expansion of solar research and development, should keep us from pursuing and expanding the more immediate and urgent research and development programs in coal gasification and liquifica-tion and in research and development associated with nuclear reactors and nuclear breeders.” (W Post, 8/6/13, A23)
June 10-20:	NASA launched Explorer 49 (rae-b; RAE 2) Radio Astronomy Explorer by a long-tank, thrust-augmented, Thor-Delta launch vehicle from Eastern Test Range at 10:14 am edt into a transfer trajectory for the moon. The second of two approved RAE missions and the last scheduled U.S. mission to the moon, Explorer 49 was to measure galactic and solar radio noise at frequencies below ionospheric cutoffs and outside terrestrial background interference, using the moon for occul-tation, focusing, or aperture-blocking for increased resolution and discrimination. At 17 min after launch, the spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle’s 3rd stage. One midcourse correction was made at 11:28 am edt June 11; the planned second correction was not required. During the transfer trajectory, data acquisition from telemetry systems was excellent. The lunar orbit insertion motor was fired at 3:21 am edt June 15, putting the spacecraft into lunar orbit with 1334-km (828.9-mi) apolune, 1123-km (697.8-mi) perilune, 241-min period, and 61.3° inclination. On June 18 the lunar insertion motor was jettisoned and the hydrazine-fueled velocity-control propulsion system placed Explorer 49 in a lower, near-circular orbit with a 1063-km (660.5-mi) apolune, 1052-km (653.7mi) perilune, 221.2-min period, and 38.7° inclination. On June 20 a 37-m (l20-ft) dipole antenna was extended by ground control and the, dipole experiment turned on. After a two-week calibration, the dipole would be retracted and the orbit adjusted as needed. The two main V antennas, joined in an X shape, would then be deployed to 183 m (600 ft). After another week, the V antennas would be deployed to their full 229-m (750-ft) length to achieve the mission’s gravity-gradient, three-axis-stabilization mode. The 200-kg (442-lb) spacecraft was the first known to use boron filament for the inertial booms that helped stabilize it during the lunar trajectory. Explorer 38 (RAE 1)—the first successful radio astronomy satellite, launched July 4, 1968—had measured galactic radio sources and traced the movement of sporadic radio outbursts from the sun beyond the orbit of Mercury for four years. Explorer 38’s receivers, however, had been saturated 25%-40% of the observing time by interference from the earth’s radio noise. Explorer 49, in lunar orbit, would be shielded from terrestrial noise as it orbited the moon’s far side. The rae project was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center under the direction of the NASA Office of Space Science. GSFC designed, constructed, and tested the spacecraft and provided the scientific instrumentation. GSFC was also responsible for the Thor-Delta launch vehicle and the operation of the worldwide Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (stdn). Launch services were provided by ksc.

The House Committee on Science and Astronautics published The Federal Government and Energy R, & D.: Historical Background. The report, by the Science Policy Research Div. of the Library of Congress Congressional Research Service, said energy research and development in the Federal Government had “followed a typically American pragmatic course. A need has appeared—necessary research has been conducted— development has occurred almost simultaneously.” One exception was the National Science Foundation. “Its support of basic research includes energy R&D projects which may or may not be based on any demonstrated needs for practical results.” To a much less extent, “basic research is conducted in other Federal agencies but their projects are usually mission-oriented.” There was no comprehensive national energy R&D program or policy.

Dr. Edward E. David, Jr., Presidential Science Adviser, resigned to return to private industry. The former communications systems scientist at Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., had served as Director of White House Office of Science and Technology for 28 mos and had instituted reorganization of the Federal science complex. The New York Times quoted White House sources as saying the resignation was prompted by disappointment that his advice had not been heeded by the Nixon Administration. Federal support for science and technology expressed as percentage of budget outlays for research and development had reached the lowest point since latter years of the Eisenhower Administration. The White House had declined comment on the resignation and had not released the text of Dr. David’s letter to the President. (Lyons, NYT, 1/3/73, 1)
The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight held hearings on NASA’s proposed space tug. The hearings sought to determine the tug’s role in the space shuttle program, the tug’s fiscal impact on the program and the overall manned space flight budget, the operational impact on NASA’s latest proposed mission model and on projected cost-per-flight of the shuttle, the Dept, of Defense role in development and use of the tug, and NASA’s and industry’s progress in tug conceptual design. Charles V. Donlan, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, and Capt. Robert F. Freitag (usn, Ret.), Deputy Director of Advanced Programs, presented an overview of the tug program Sept. 5 but made no recommendations, pending completion of a study. NASA would later recommend program approach and supporting rationale. Representatives of General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div,, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., Martin Marietta Co. Denver Div., and Grumman Aerospace Corp. presented results of efforts to date, with supporting data to substantiate the options afforded NASA in proceeding with tug development.

A Chicago Sun-Times editorial praised the “mapmaking” of the Skylab 3 astronauts (launched July 28 to man the Skylab 1 Orbital Workshop launched May 14) : “We were particularly impressed to read about their assigned job of photographing a swamp in southern Sudan as they zipped over North Africa.” Such tasks “point up the way in which a space shuttle can be used to facilitate jobs on Earth and, no less important, encourage co-operation between nations.” (C Sun-Times, 9/4/73) September 5:	President Nixon submitted to Congress Science Indicators, 1972, the fifth annual report of the National Science Board of the National Science Foundation. The proportion of the gross national product spent for research and development 1963—1971 declined in the U.S., France, and the United Kingdom, but increased in the U.S.S.R., Japan, and West Germany. By 1971, U.S. r&d expenditures were 2.6% of GNP, Soviet 3.0%, U.K. and West Germany 2.0%, and Japan and France 1.8% each. The number of scientists and engineers engaged in r&d per 10 000 persons declined in the U.S. after 1969, but continued to increase in the U.S.S.R., Japan, West Germany, and France. All countries reduced the national defense proportion of their R&D expenditures significantly between 1961 and 1969. U.S. defense expenditures dropped from 65% to 49% of total Government R&D spending. Increases in the U.S. and most other countries occurred in space, community services, and economic development. The U.S. had a favorable but declining “patent balance” between 1966 and 1970, with a reduced number of patents of U.S. origin in France, West Germany, and the U.K. and increased U.S. patents of Japanese origin. The U.S. had an increasingly favorable position in the sale of “technical know-how”—including patents, techniques, formulas, franchises, and manufacturing rights—during 1960-1971; Japan was the major purchaser, surpassing all of Western Europe after 1967. The favorable U.S. balance of trade in technology-intensive products grew 1960-1971, but was increasingly negative in nontechnology-intensive areas. Within technology-intensive areas, products with the fastest rising trade surplus were aircraft, computers, and plastics. (PD, 9/10/73, 1069; Text)
NASA launched a Black Brant VC sounding rocket from White Sands Missile Range carrying a Goddard Space Flight Center payload to a 276.8-km (172-mi) altitude.

NASA launched a Javelin sounding rocket from Natal, Brazil, carrying a Univ. of California barium cloud experiment. The rocket and instruments performed satisfactorily, (gsfc proj off) November 18-Dec. 1: U.S. flight crews for the July 1975 U.S.—U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission visited the U.S.S.k. for familiarization with the Soyuz spacecraft and discussions with Soviet counterparts on the flight plan. The discussions, held mostly at the Yuri A. Gagarin Center for Cosmonaut Training near Moscow, included joint crew activities and onboard documentation. Astronauts participating were Thomas P. Stafford, U.S. astp commander; Vance D. Brand, command module pilot; and Donald K. Slayton, docking module pilot; backup crew Alan L. Bean, Ronald E. Evans, and Jack R. Lousma; support crew Robert F. Overmyer and Karol J. Bobko; and Eugene A. Cernan, Special Assistant to the U.S. astp Technical Director. At a press conference following the Nov. 29 concluding meeting, Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Shatalov, chief of cosmonaut training, said the U.S.S.R. planned further manned space flights—individual Soyuz missions and linkups of Soyuz with .the Salyut orbital platform—before the joint U.S — U.S.S.R. mission. Stafford told newsmen he was completely satisfied that the Soyuz would be “a great ship to fly.” He said there would be two joint training sessions in 1974, in Moscow in July and at Johnson Space Center in September, (nasa Release 73-250; Smith, NYT, 11/30/73, 9)

The 1973 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded in Stockholm to three pioneers in ethology, the comparative study of behavior. Austrian-born Dr. Karl von Frisch, retired, and Dr. Konrad Lorenz of the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology, shared the $121 000 cash prize with Netherlands-born Dr. Nikolaas Tinbergen, professor of animal behavior at Oxford Univ. (NYT, 10/12/73, 1) October 12:	NASA research pilot Einar K. Enevoldson conducted the first flight of a new remotely piloted research vehicle (rprv). A three-eighths scale model of an Air Force high-performance F—15 fighter—air-launched from a B-52 aircraft from Flight Research Center at 14 000 m (45 000 ft)—was controlled by Enevoldson from a ground cockpit with flight instruments and a TV screen. His commands were fed through a computer programmed with F—15 flight characteristics to the RPRV; flight information from the rprv and video signals from its TV camera were transmitted to the ground control station. After a nine-minute flight, the RPRV descended 5000 m (15 000 ft) and a series of parachutes were deployed to slow the descent rate. An Air Force helicopter recovered the rprv in mid-air and lowered it to the ground for reuse. Eventually the 7-m (23-ft) model would be flown through stall and spin maneuvers using the new FRC-developed flight research technique to reduce the cost of flight-testing experimental aircraft and spacecraft.

Dr. Dixy Lee Ray, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, read a message from President Nixon during a speech before the annual meeting of the Atomic Industrial Forum and American Nuclear Society in San Francisco: It was “important that the aec aggressively pursue research and development of the harnessing of thermonuclear fusion to produce electric power. While the fusion program is a longer-range effort, we have a responsibility to future generations to do our very best to perfect this process, since it promises to provide mankind with a virtually limitless supply of clean energy. Nuclear power in all its forms —both present fission and breeder reactors and fusion—must accept a greater share of the world’s energy load in the years ahead.” (Text)
NASA launched three sounding rockets in a series from Wallops Station carrying Goddard Space Flight Center payloads to determine the ion composition and electron density of the ionospheric D-region. A Nike-Cajun was launched to an 86.2-km (53.6-mi) altitude. The rocket and instrumentation performed satisfactorily. An Astrobee D was launched 18 min later to a 92.5-km (57.5-mi) altitude. The rocket performance was less than planned. The instrumentation was satisfactory except for the Gerdien trap, which ceased providing data at 22 sec. A Nike-Apache was launched three minutes after the Astrobee D to a 77.4-km (48.1-mi) altitude. The rocket performed satisfactorily but no useful scientific data were received from the ion mass spectrometer and the scientific objectives of this flight were not achieved, (nasa Rpts SRL)

A Navy F—14 jet fighter aircraft shot itself down over the Pacific with a Sparrow air-to-air missile launched erratically from its mount beneath the aircraft. The two Grumman Aerospace Corp. crewmen ejected and were rescued unharmed by a Navy helicopter. The F-14 had been flight-testing the missile’s ability to drop clear of its mount before firing, the Navy explained in a statement issued June 21, but the missile failed to clear, struck the fuselage, and exploded. It was the third loss of an F—14 since the swing-wing aircraft’s December 1970 maiden test flight. (Witkin, NYT, 6/22/73, 8)
Rep, Wright Patman (D-Tex.) introduced H.J.R. 255 to change the name of Manned Spacecraft Center to Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in honor of the late President. He said: “Lyndon Johnson understood the importance of space exploration to the people of the United States and its ultimate benefits to all of mankind. He understood the necessity of this advance technology to our security, He understood the stimulation this new field would create in our educational systems. He understood the palpable gains to the average citizen from our weather, communications, and other applications satellites. He understood the challenge to excellence and achievement it posed to our scientists, engineers, and technicians. But most of all, he understood ... the need of man to explore, to reach out, and to seek new ways to bend science and technology to our use.” (CR, 1/29/73, S1467)
NASA’s 15th anniversary year—memorable for advances in earth resources technology, aeronautics progress, expanded international cooperation in space, and increased promise for future manned and unmanned planetary exploration—boosted the U.S. space program from the spectacular orbit of Apollo lunar exploration to a steady program of extended service to science and mankind. Skylab’s triumph heralded the approach of the shuttle era that would weld with the earth the vast regions of near-earth space, extending man’s transportation system into regions beyond land, sea, and air. The newest Pioneer probes began penetration into the mysteries of outer planetary space. Budget restrictions in line with President Nixon’s January 1250-billion target for total Government spending slowed space shuttle manpower buildup, suspended work on the High Energy Astronomy Observatory, and required phase-out of communications satellite work and curtailment of work on nuclear propulsion. But Skylab, the space shuttle, the scheduled U.S.-U.S.S.R. 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission, the Viking, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn mission, and many applications and aeronautics projects were retained in a balanced and productive program. Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for the past seven years and member of the NASA staff since October 1958, retired at the end of the year. Dr. Newell had been Science Program Coordinator in the Nation’s first satellite program, the Naval Research Laboratory’s Project Vanguard, before establishment of NASA. Tight funding and the near completion of the Skylab missions brought a net reduction in NASA Civil Service employees of 1646, including retirements, during the calendar year, with a total 25 598 on board Jan. 5, 1974. Headquarters employees dropped by a net change of 80, Kennedy Space Center by 117, Johnson Space Center by 110, Marshall Space Flight Center by 374, Ames Research Center by 49, Flight Research Center by 13, Langley Research Center by 62, Lewis Research Center by 494 (with the phasing down of Plum Brook Station), Goddard Space Flight Center by 289, and Wallops Station by 14. aec-nasa Space Nuclear Systems Office was closed with the end of the nerva program. Further reductions of 628—including 405 at msfc and 200 at LeRC—were scheduled in 1974, to bring the FY 1974 end-of-year total to the required 24 970 ceiling. Aerospace industry employment in the Nation increased to 946 000 in June but declined to 935 000 by the year’s end. Techniques developed for aerospace activities were applied to earthquake prediction, development of residential solar heating, and fuelsaving integrated systems for housing. NASA added 550 technical briefs to its more than 5000 technical innovations already available for U.S, industry use. More than 68 000 U.S. industrial and commercial firms requested additional data on these innovations. Some 3000 firms spent $625 000 for special assistance from nasa’s Regional Dissemination Centers; 1500 firms purchased 1891 computer programs and related documentation for $221 530. NASA liberalized its patent-licensing procedures to speed technology transfer and during 1973 five exclusive patent licenses, the largest number since the program’s inception, were granted. A nasa liaison office was opened in New York City to work directly with city agencies on public safety, drug detection, and fire prevention. A rechargeable heart pacemaker was developed under nasa auspices by the Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Laboratory. Electronic components designed for space use were incorporated in the device, which could be recharged at home by the patient, eliminating the need for surgery every two years to replace conventional devices. A new radio transmitter temperature pill allowed doctors to check localized internal body temperature changes. A portable visual testing device permitted early detection of eye disorders. A test hospital room for paralyzed patients used space-developed devices for remote operation of communications systems and appliances. The nasa FY 1974 appropriation of $3,002 billion was $13.9 million below the budget request, $62.4 million below the $3.0645-billion FY 1973 authorization, and $406 million below the FY 1973 appropriation of $3,408 billion.

The National Science Foundation released Graduate Student Support and Manpower Resources in Graduate Science Education (nsf 73—304). Graduate science enrollment in doctorate departments applying for nsf traineeships declined 3% from 1970 to 1971 in all scientific areas except psychology and the social sciences. The number of students enrolling for the first time dropped 4% in 1970 and 8% in 1971. Graduate enrollment of foreign students declined 2% in 1971, after having increased 10% from 1967 to 1968 and another 11% by 1969. The enrollment dropoff of nearly 2% in full-time graduate science students was attributed to an acute financial squeeze, during which several leading universities began restricting enrollment, and to student disenchantment with science and technology because of rising unemployment among scientists and engineers.

The Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics continued hearings on NASA’s FY 1974 authorization. Dale D. Myers, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, identified locations for space shuttle development: Kennedy Space Center and Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., as the launch and landing sites; NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility for the external tank production; and the Rockwell International Corp. facility at Downey, Calif., for orbiter and systems integration. “The major unknown, at the moment, is where the solid rocket boosters will be produced and tested. We expect that this location will be identified when the solid fueled rocket booster contract is awarded this November.” Philip E. Culbertson, Director of Mission and Payload Integration in omsf, contrasted a typical operational communications satellite program using expendable launch vehicles with one using the space shuttle. Launched on the Titan IIIB-Centaur launch vehicle, each spacecraft was estimated at 467 kg (1030 lbs). To fulfill 1979-1990 requirements for reliable communications services, 26 spacecraft would be required. Use of the Titan IIIB-Centaur would require 26 new spacecraft and 26 new launch vehicles, at an average cost for each flight of $25.8 million. “If the same program is carried out using the Shuttle and Tug, the cost changes significantly. First, with the Shuttle we can apply the low cost approaches to payload design. We are no longer constrained by weight limitations; therefore, we can ruggedize the spacecraft structure, simplify the design and verification test program, and thus reduce both development and unit spacecraft cost.” The shuttle and tug combination could deploy and retrieve 2 satellites on a single flight, making 13 flights to deploy 26 spacecraft—10 new and 16 refurbished. On 8 of these flights 2 spacecraft would be deployed and retrieved. “The total cost for conducting the program would be $14.9 million per spacecraft flight, compared to the $25.8 million for the expendable approach—a savings of 42 percent.” m/g Robert H. Curtin (usaf, Ret.), nasa Director of Facilities, discussed disposition of facilities at Lewis Research Center’s Plum Rrook Station, which would he closed because of FY 1974 budget cuts. LeRC was discussing the station’s availability and capability with potential user agencies—including the Electric Research Council, which planned to establish an electric power research institute, and the Eusi-ness and Employment Council of the Governor of Ohio, which had recommended establishment of a state-funded Ohio Development Center. LeRC was studying possible use of the station’s reactor for environmental research by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Plum Rrook space power facility was being prepared to test the shroud for NASA’s Viking spacecraft but “there are no additional programmatic needs for the use of this facility and it is anticipated that it will be placed in a standby mode by the end of Fiscal Year 1974.” (Transcript)
The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight held a hearing on the General Accounting Office’s June 1 report on space shuttle program costs. NASA’s Deputy Associate Administrator Willis H. Shapley testified: “nasa believes that the results of our cost benefit analyses are important and valid elements supporting the decision to develop the Space Shuttle, even though the principal justification for the Space Shuttle is in the new capabilities it will provide. In our view, the GAO review, which we welcome as an independent review and check of what we have attempted to do, has not found or demonstrated any substantial reasons for questioning the correctness of the decision which has been made to proceed with the development of the Space Shuttle.” The Subcommittee concluded, following their testimony by NASA and Gao representatives: “a. The five noneconomic issues cited by gao ‘ as major considerations in the decision to develop a space shuttle are valid and proper elements in the original decision to proceed and in the future evaluation of the progress and pace of space shuttle development, b. Cost, performance and schedule goals and estimates are both a valid and essential element in the decision making process of the Congress and the GAO studies in these areas . . . must have sufficient depth to encompass all major cost considerations, c. The fragmentary arguments with respect to costs advanced by GAO reports are so incomplete as to fail to validate the GAO conclusions drawn from them. d. That GAO should continue review of the space shuttle program development in conjunction with the legislative and oversight activities of the responsible committees of Congress with emphasis on evaluation of cost, performance and schedule as the space shuttle development program progresses.” (Transcript)

Twelve sensors mounted on an Air Force NC—135 aircraft flying 11 km (7 mi) above the Sahara desert had found no evidence of the shadow bands which had swept over the landscape just before the June 30 total solaT eclipse, the New York Times reported. A Canadian aircraft flying in the troposphere, the lowest region of the atmosphere, had seen the bands—one of the most unusual manifestations of the eclipse—clearly and had photographed them on the aircraft’s wing. Astronomers had theorized that-the bands resulted from refraction of the narrow slit of sunlight that shone through atmospheric layers when the sun was almost totally eclipsed. Another theory was that the sunlight had been detracted by the edge of the moon.

Brick for “her outstanding contributions to women’s aviation over the past 23 years” as a member and Chairman of the Board of the All-Women’s Transcontinental Air Race “Powder Puff Derby.” (naa News, 9/73, 1—2; faa Release 73— 155; A&A 1972) September 3:	The U.S. had “discreetly blocked” Soviet attempts to purchase 10 ilc Industries’ Apollo lunar-configured spacesuits, Aviation Week & Space Technology'said. The U.S.S.R. had been told that U.S. export of such technology could not be approved. (Av Wk, 9/3/73, 11) September 4:	World atlases were inaccurate in delineating outer boundaries of polar icecaps according to imagery returned by Nimbus 5 (weather satellite launched by NASA Dec. 10, 1972), NASA announced. A Goddard Space Flight Center study had shown that synoptic photos from Nimbus 5 clearly indicated polar regions underwent large-scale changes in a short time. Boundaries between the multiyear icepack around the North Pole and the large areas of first-year ice varied significantly within one freezing season. Even greater changes occurred around Antarctica. Nimbus 5 also was measuring daily rainfall distribution over the earth’s oceans to indicate to meteorologists how much energy was being released into the global atmosphere. An electrically scanning microwave radiometer aboard the spacecraft was measuring rainfall rate and heat thus released to enable forecasters to understand a tropical storm or hurricane and predict its 24- to 48-hr intensity, (nasa Releases 73-176, 73-175)
Lunar laser ranging system at the Univ. of Texas McDonald Observatory located the French retroreflector array attached to the Soviet unmanned explorer Lunokhod 2 (landed on the moon Jan. 16 by Luna 21). At the request of the French National Center for Space Studies (cnes), the 270-cm (107-in) McDonald telescope transmitted light pulses, which were observed after reflection from mirror array. Preliminary data indicated the surface location of Lunokhod 2 was very near coordinates given by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The lunar radius at that point appeared to be smaller than previous data had indicated, (nasa Release 73-13)

nasa Associate Administrator for Applications Charles W. Mathews testified on nasa’s FY 1974 applications program in authorization hearings before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. With communications satellite services being provided throughout the world “on a highly useful, economic, and profitable basis,” NASA had turned its emphasis to earth resources observations from satellites. “Perhaps the most significant event occurred last July [23] with the launch and successful operation of the first Earth resources technology satellite, . . . whose very special images of the Earth’s surface are being provided to users and investigators here and throughout the world every day.” More than 300 investigations were under way and “important uses are being defined in almost every area under study.” The Noaa 2 satellite launched by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oct. 15, 1972, “afforded for the first time the measurement of temperatures at various heights in the atmosphere throughout the entire world on a truly operational basis.” The information was being rapidly provided to the U.S. Weather Service for prediction programs. In addition, more precise images of global cloud cover were being obtained night and day. Noaa 2, in conjunction with the continuation of the experimental program through the launch of Nimbus 5 in December, “bodes well for continued progress in meteorology.” New efforts in earth observations to start under the FY 1974 budget were in pollution monitoring, oceanography, and earth and ocean physics. In technology applications, NASA was supporting the Dept, of Housing and Urban Development on integrated utility systems to minimize energy consumption and waste output in housing units and the Dept, of Transportation in urban mass transportation. Special programs also included manufacturing in space. In a new lead-center concept, responsibility for support in particular disciplines had been assigned to Centers: Johnson Space Center—Earth Resources Center; Goddard Space Flight Center—Weather and Climate Center; and Ames Research Center—applications aircraft program. The Applications Program Integration Board (apib) had been established to evaluate major new proposals for applications or modifications to major ongoing efforts. (Transcript)
Appointment of David R. Scott, former astronaut, as Deputy Director of Flight Research Center was announced by frc.

After leaving the astronaut corps in 1972, he had served as Technical Assistant to the Apollo Program Manager and as Special Assistant for Mission Operations and Government Furnished Equipment in the Apollo Spacecraft Office at Manned Spacecraft Center (which became Johnson Space Center Feb. 17). He held two nasa Distinguished Service Medals, the nasa Exceptional Service Medal, two Air Force Distinguished Service Medals, the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross, the David C. Schilling Trophy of the Air Force, and the Robert J. Collier Trophy for 1971. (frc Release 21—73)
The “much vaunted European challenge” to U.S. aerospace industry would “remain a myth,” an Interavia editorial said. Recent agreements for U.S. companies to provide European manufacturers access to their high technology might seem against U.S. interests, but “such agreements are in fact usually followed by orders for U.S.-designed aircraft.” It was “not simply that the currency crisis has made the US product much cheaper than the competitive European design, but also that the Americans are in a position to contract out production work on a proven sales success.” European commercial aircraft industry products would “never achieve the success expected of them.” Europe’s total share of the Western market for commercial aircraft—just over 9%—was “steadily dropping as the early model bac Ills and Caravelles are withdrawn from service and there are no advanced versions to replace them.” However tempting technologically the advanced commercial aircraft offered by European industry might be, “they are not what many airlines want in the present economic climate.” There “seems little or no inclination in Europe to accept inter-dependence in high technology areas. There is apparently more of a readiness to cooperate across the Atlantic than across the European frontiers. If the European aerospace industry wishes to remain a viable, independent force on the world scene, then the time has surely come when something more than lip service must be paid to the European ideal.” (Interavia, 9/73, 939)
Objectives of Skylab’s scientific and engineering experiments were outlined in a Kennedy Space Center press briefing. The 57 major experiment components aboard the space station scheduled for May 14 launch would provide data for 270 investigations in earth resources, solar astronomy, and materials science by 702 investigators and associates— 200 of them foreign. Dr. Edward J. McLaughlin, NASA Director for Space Medicine, said 20 life sciences experiments would provide “a comprehensive picture of the interactions of man with his environment and of various body systems that are influenced ... by the space environment.” They would deal primarily with the metabolic and cardiovascular systems, exercise capacity, and nutrition. Dr. Goetz K. Oertel, NASA Chief of Solar Physics, said the objective of Skylab astronomy was “the study of the stars, including the sun, and other objects in space such as planets,| comets, objects and libration points near the moon, and x-ray objects in the sky.” Emphasis would be placed on the study of solar activity known to influence general weather patterns and on solar flares, responsible for radio communication blackouts and interference. Skylab was unique in that it would be manned. The astronaut would be able to align the instruments and select targets of interest, taking advantage of phenomena as it occurred. Dr. Robert A. Parker, astronaut and Skylab program scientist, said that corollary experiments would study gas and particles surrounding the Skylab and their effect on sensitive instruments, collect micrometeoroids, study man-made disturbances in Skylab and their effect on instrument alignment, and study flammable materials and manufacturing techniques in the zero-g environment.

The House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology continued hearings on the FY 1974 NASA authorization. George W. Cherry, Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs in the nasa Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology, described the Dept, of Transportation Climatic-Impact Assessment Program (ciap), in which nasa was cooperating: The ciap “undertakes to assess the potential impact on the atmosphere of large fleets of SSTS [supersonic transports] operating in the eighties and the biological consequences of their potential modification of the stratosphere. We are cooperating with dot by contributing to the technology needs of ciap, with particular emphasis on the levels to which pollution can be limited.” Contradictory requirements for civil transport aircraft (low-fuel consumption engines required by SSTs for good range and payload characteristics, tended to be extremely noisy in terminal areas) might be best met by variable-cycle engines that varied their mode of operation in each condition of the flight profile, nasa would “intensively study variable cycle-engine concepts in FY 1974.” Dr. Seymour C. Himmel, Deputy Associate Administrator for Technology in oast, testified that hypersonic research for potential application to military and civil airbreathing cruise vehicles was directed at “the critical aspects of propulsion, structures, and aerodynamics for this flight regime where hydrogen is used both as the fuel and as a coolant.” Hydrogen was the most likely candidate for hypersonic aircraft fuel because its high coolant capacity was essential for a propulsion system to survive in the high-temperature environment, and liquid hydrogen’s coolant capacity could cool portions of the vehicle’s structure away from the engine area. NASA’s structures and materials program provided essential technology for designing lightweight, reliable, actively cooled structures and advanced the technology of actively cooling structures heated to high temperatures. The program also extended shuttle technology on reusable surface insulation toward hypersonic cruise application. Flight Research Center test pilot Gary E. Krier testified on nasa’s digital fly-by-wire program to develop an all-electric flight-control system using intelligence inserted into the digital computer memory. “We did this by using refurbished Apollo equipment and two surplus [Navy] F-8 fighters. Using this approach, we estimate we flew about 2 years earlier than we otherwise could have.” To date, nasa had flown 15 DFBW flights with no major problems. “Airliners that we’ll ride in the 1980’s could profit from fly-by-wrre in the form of smooth flight at very high speeds and the near elimination of the response to turbulence by computer application of smoothing controls.” The “best use of fbw” was to build a control-configured vehicle [ccv] with reduced drag, increased lift, and slower approach and landing speeds. “It has been estimated that landing speed could be cut by 25 percent and range increased 15 percent with no sacrifice in mission capability, just by modifying existing aircraft. A much larger improvement in performance could be gained by starting from scratch with fbw. We have been refining aircraft for years now, and the fbw/ccv combination gives us a chance to make a quantum jump in aircraft performance.” (Transcript)
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Program Director Chester M. Lee testified on the status of the joint 1975 U.S.-U.S.S.R. mission, during the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight hearings on the FY 1974 NASA authorization. Activities were being directed to identify and define candidate astp experiments to provide data for U.S. and Soviet scientists, provide for coinvestigators in both countries, require active cooperation by Soviet cosmonauts, and use existing hardware where possible. Experiments would be discussed at the March meeting of U.S.-U.S.S.R. working groups [see March 15-30]. No launch vehicle work specifically for ASTP had begun, but modification, testing, and checkout would begin during the coming year at Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39 and other facilities. The program was “on schedule and moving well toward our current mission date of mid-July 1975.” (Transcript)
The National Science Foundation released Research and Development in Industry 1971: Funds, 1971; Scientists & Engineers, January 1972 (nsf 73—305). Industry spent $18.3 billion on r&d activities in 1971— a gain of 1% over the 1970 level. Company r&d funds increased by 4% 1970-1971, with the companies financing 58% of total U.S. R&D effort; r&d decreased only in the aircraft and missiles industry. Aircraft firms spent 6% less on r&d in 1971 than in 1970. The ratio of R&D spending to net sales had declined steadily from its 1964 peak. In 1971 the ratio was 3.5%—the lowest since 1957. The number of r&d scientists and engineers in industry also continued to decline. Between January 1969 and January 1972 the number decreased by 9%, to 325 200. During this period r&d professionals in the aircraft industry dropped by 27%. (Text)

The U.S.S.R. Tu-144 supersonic transport had reached a speed of 2100 km per hr (1300 mph) during a test flight, Tass reported. It had carried Soviet journalists to an altitude of 17 km (11 mi) on a 90-min flight between Moscow and Saralov. The designer, Gen. Aleksey A. Tupolev, had said new design changes included extendable wings on the front that improved aerodynamic performance. The engine and landing gear had also been improved. (Tass, fbis-Sov, 6/1/73, L4)
Skylab science and medical briefings were held by NASA at Johnson Space Center. Results from the first Orbital Workshop mission, Skylab 1—2 (launched May 14 and May 25), were discussed and science plans for the Skylab 3 mission, scheduled for launch July 28, were announced. At an Apollo Telescope Mount briefing Dr. Robert A. MacQueen, a Skylab principal investigator and High Altitude Observatory scientist, said that a first look at available data indicated that the objectives—■ to examine the solar corona on a regular basis, deduce the threedimensional structure and geometry of the corona, understand the evolution of the corona and its relationship to the solar disk, and understand the outflow of the solar wind from the corona—would be met. The most important conclusion drawn was that “in appearance the corona is now a less dynamic subject than other solar phenomena.” Dr. Edward M. Reeves, Harvard College Observatory scientist, said that an ATM scanner had observed “velocity changes in whole large areas of the Sun in lines of the transition region and the corona which have never before been seen in this part of the spectrum.” At the medical science briefing, Dr. Michael W. Whittle, Principal Coordinating Scientist, said that the weight losses of the three Skylab 2 astronauts—1.8 kg (4 lbs) for Charles Conrad, Jr., 2.7 kg (6 lbs) for Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, and 3.6 kg (8 lbs) for Paul J. Weitz—were “pure and simple adaptation to weightlessness. . . . Increased nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus, the major constituents of muscle tissue, had appeared in the urine and indicated the muscle loss. Dr. Stephen L. Kimsey, a Skylab principal investigator, said that experiments had shown “no abnormal changes in red cell metabolism” in amount of energy stored, change in the integrity of the cell membrane, or change in the red cells’ ability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the tissue. Dr. Verl R. Wilmarth, earth resources experiment package project scientist, said during an erep briefing that the objective of mapping the depression of the sea surface of the Puerto Rican trench using altimeter data had been met. At a briefing on the corollary experiments Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, Associate Director for Science at Marshall Space Flight Center, said that the materials processing and welding experiments would help verify methods of construction and assembly in weightless conditions. Among the first things built in space might be a reflector for microwavq energy, to transmit large amounts of energy from one point of the earth to another. A reflector of the size needed could not be launched in one piece but would have to be assembled in space. Dr. Robert A. Parker, astronaut and Skylab program scientist, said new experiments that would be flown on Skylab 3 included a vehicle disturbance experiment; a survey of celestial sources of x-rays; two circadian rhythm experiments, one with vinegar gnats and the other with desert mice; movement tests of astronauts with two different extravehicular activity backpacks; a gallium arsenide crystal growth experiment; observation of cellular mechanisms and metabolism in zero g; observations of the earth’s ozone and airglow in the upper atmosphere; the collection of micrometeoroids; and an evaluation of the spectral capability of the human eye while observing earth resources from space.

The National Science Foundation released Immigrant Scientists and Engineers in the United States (nsf 73-302). A mid-1970 survey of characteristics and attitudes of foreign scientists and engineers who had immigrated to the U.S. between 1964 and 1969 showed most had come seeking a higher standard of living. Nearly 6 of every 10 held a Ph.D. or Master’s degree. One of every five had continued graduate training. More than 90% were employed in professional positions, and more than one half were in research and development. Although the majority were under 40 yrs of age, 35% had authored scientific papers in the U.S. and 8% held U.S. patents. (Text) August 7:	The earth had passed between NASA’s Pioneer 10 (launched toward Jupiter March 2, 1972) and the sun for the second time during its 1-billion-km (620-million-mi) journey, Ames Research Center announced. Pioneer 10 was 850 million km (530 million mi) from the earth and was scheduled to make history’s first visit to Jupiter in December. When the spacecraft, the earth, and the sun were aligned in inferior conjunction, Pioneer 10’s sun sensor would look almost directly at the sun, interfering with the sensor’s count of the spacecraft rotation rate. To avoid the problem, arc flight directors were keeping the pointing direction of the spacecraft’s radio beam and sun sensor 1.5° from the sun and 1° from the earth. Pioneer 11 (launched toward Jupiter April 5, 1973) was 150 million km (93 million mi) from the earth. Both spacecraft were functioning well, (arc Release 73-84)
Soviet Novosty Press science writer Yury Marinin said in a letter to the Washington Post that the U.S.S.R. “abandonment” of manned lunar missions did not mean that nation was lagging behind the U.S. in space exploration. “Soviet specialists think it more expedient to explore the moon by automatic devices, with the present level of world technology. Besides, manned flights to the moon involve tremendous expenses.” Soviet automatic devices would be “steadily improved as they continue their planned studies of the moon.” (TV Post, 1/11/73, A19)
NASA’s instrumented Convair 990 aircraft Galileo, piloted by Ames Research Center pilot J.

Dr. James C. Fletcher, nasa Administrator, met in Cleveland with Ohio newspaper editors and businessmen to discuss the space program’s future and applications of NASA technology. He denied rumors that Lewis Research Center would be delegated responsibility as the national center for energy research, but said LeRC would continue its important role in Government energy research. Dr. Fletcher predicted the next steps in space would be establishment of a permanently inhabited space station, probably by the U.S.S.R.; establishment of a permanent base on the moon; and a manned mission to Mars. “But I don’t see a manned Mars mission in this century, unless it is a cooperative venture with the Russians.” He said the U.S.S.R. had “let up on their secrecy enormously in recent months” in preparation for the July 1975 joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Apollo-Soyuz docking mission. (Cl PD, 11/28/73)
The April 12 loss of NASA’s instrumented Convair 990 aircraft Galileo would have “very serious effects” on NASA’s research programs, Dr. Hans Mark, Ames Research Center Director, told the press in Mountain-view, Calif. The $5-million aircraft had been carrying more than $l-million worth of equipment when it and a Navy aircraft collided and crashed in flames. The Galileo had participated in the Feb. 17-March 8 U.S.—U.S.S.R. survey of the Bering Sea and was scheduled to chart the patterns of whales and other sea mammals. “It was one of the major programs at Ames.” Dr. Mark said. “We do not have another aircraft to carry on its work.” It would be “impossible” to go ahead with the project. A joint NASA-Navy investigation would try to determine the cause of the collision, r/a Herbert S. Ainsworth (usn) told the press that human error was responsible. (W Post, 4/14/73, A3)

The dizziness and nausea of Skylab 2 Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz on their return to the earth June 22 were probably due to problems of the inner ear, the Wall Street Journal quoted Dr. Willard R. Hawkins, Johnson Space Center Deputy Director of Life Sciences for Medical Operations, as saying. The symptoms had occurred particularly when the men moved their heads from side to side. Dr. Hawkins had theorized that the fluid in the semicircular canal, whose movement transmitted impulses via tiny hairs in the ear to the brain, was out of action because of the long period of weightlessness. When the astronauts had come under the sudden influence of gravity, the inner-ear mechanism became unusually sensitive to almost any head movement. Ordinary movements could produce the symptoms of motion sickness. The inner-ear balancing mechanism could adapt to gravity quickly. Dr. Kerwin, the most affected, had returned to normal after 12 hrs.

President Nixon signed S J.R. 37 into Public Law 93-8, redesignating the Manned Spacecraft Center the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in honor of the late President, who died Jan. 22. The President said: “Few men in our time have better understood the value of space exploration than Lyndon Johnson.” As senator, Johnson had written, introduced, and helped to enact legislation which created NASA. He had called NASA the “proudest legislative achievement” of his congressional career. As Vice President and Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, he had served in the “early years of exploration when the groundwork was laid, and the determination made to put a man on the moon.” As President, Johnson had overseen the first Apollo flights, “in a way that led people beyond the adventure and the pride to the deeper meaning and the deeper benefits of space exploration.” President Johnson “by his vision and his work and his support” had drawn America up closer to the stars “and before he died he saw us reach the moon—the first great plateau along the way.” (PD, 2/26/73, 160)
Unusual pulsed-noise signals detected by Soviet scientists at Gorky Univ. [see Oct. 16] might be from experimental U.S. Air Force communications satellites in highly elliptical Molniya-like orbits, Aviation Week & Space Technology said. Possible sources were satellites orbited March 21, 1971, and Aug. 21, 1973—thought to be test vehicles for the Air Force’s planned Satellite Data System. (Av Wk, 11/5/73, 47) The primary objectives were to place the spacecraft in sun-synchronous orbit with a local equator crossing time of 8:30 am to permit the spacecraft to accomplish its operational mission requirements, make an in-orbit evaluation, and check out the spacecraft before turning operational control over to noaa’s National Environmental Satellite Service (ness) . Operational responsibility for the spacecraft was transferred to noaa Nov. 29. Excellent data were being returned. The orbit would permit regular, dependable daytime and nighttime meteorological observations in both direct-readout and stored modes of operation in support of the National Operational Meteorological Satellite System (nomss). Noaa 3 was the second operational spacecraft to provide temperature soundings of the earth’s atmosphere as well as direct-readout and globally recorded cloud-cover data. The three-axis-stabilized satellite carried redundant very-high-resolution radiometers, vertical-temperature-profile radiometers, and scanning radiometers. Noaa 3 was the fourth in the Improved tiros Operational Satellite series of second-generation meteorological satellites. The prototype had been Itos 1 (launched Jan. 23, 1970), and the first NOAA-funded spacecraft, Noaa 1, had been launched Dec. 11, 1970. Noaa 2 (launched Oct. 15, 1972) continued to provide meteorological data. The first series of spacecraft had included nine satellites—Essa 1 through Essa 9 (launched 1966-1969). The tos program was a joint NASA and Dept, of Commerce effort under a Jan. 30, 1964, agreement. Goddard Space Flight Center was responsible for the design and development of the spacecraft and ground systems, launch checkout and evaluation, tracking and data acquisition, and the Thor-Delta launch vehicle, ness was responsible for operating the spacecraft and processing the data, (nasa prog off; GSFC proj off) November 6:	Fourteen hairline cracks were found in the eight stabilizing fins of Skylab 4’s Saturn IB launch vehicle during a routine inspection at Kennedy Space Center.

Six of the fins had two cracks each, the two others one crack each, all at the juncture of the 5-m (16-ft) aluminum fins and the body of the launch vehicle. During rocket inspection, Skylab 4 Astronauts Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue practiced launch abort procedures in a simulator at Johnson Space Center.

A Science editorial commented on the altered structure of Federal science advisory apparatus arising from the demise of the Office of Science and Technology and the July 10 appointment of the National Science Foundation Director, Dr. H. Guyford Stever, as Presidential Science Adviser and Chairman of the Federal Council for Science and Technology. Dr. Stever had met with presidents or principal officers of most of the major scientific and engineering organizations and had indicated “that he would welcome policy advice and recommendations concerning personnel. As specific problems arise, the appropriate organizations will be tapped. Thus it seems that a major difference between the new and the old apparatus will be the replacement of a small, formal, elite group by more broadly based ad hoc groups. The concept is worth a try. Whether it will be viable will depend on how effectively it is implemented by both sides.” (Abelson, Science, 10/5/73, 13)

NASA launched an Areas sounding rocket—second in a series of two—from Antigua, West Indies, carrying a Goddard Space Flight Center payload to a 52.5-km (32.6-mi) altitude. The objectives were to measure the ozone distribution in the upper atmosphere, monitor anomalous ultraviolet absorption for the evaluation of the Nimbus 4 (meteorological satellite launched April 8, 1970) backscatter uv experiment, and extend the data base for a climatology of stratospheric ozone in the tropics. The rocket was launched during a Nimbus 4 overpass. The rocket and instrumentation performed satisfactorily. The first rocket in this series was launched Feb. 13. (nasa Rpt srl) February 21:	The emergency team formed by NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Navy’s Fleet Weather Facility to aid Jacques-Yves Cousteau’s crippled research vessel Calypso [see Feb. 15] had been disbanded, NASA announced. The Calypso had safely navigated the dangerous Drake Passage between Antarctica and the Ushuaia port, Argentina, using weather and ice information supplied by Ats 3 satellite. Satellite photos had been processed at Goddard Space Flight Center, turned over to fwf, and analyzed and information transmitted to Cousteau aboard the Calypso, (nasa Release 73-33)
Apollo 17 geologist-astronaut Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt testified on the legacy of the Apollo program before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight in hearings on NASA’s FY 1974 authorization: As man emerged “from the scientific revolution brought about by Apollo on the Moon with the simultaneous revolution brought about by new insight into the origins of ocean basins and continents on the Earth, we may begin to understand the great stresses and strains within our crust as ocean floors grow and continents move. These stresses and strains profoundly affect the everyday lives of people living within belts of present earthquakes and volcanic activity. Within future understanding of the frozen ocean of basalt of [Oceanus] Procellarum and the vast ridge and volcanic system that splits it, may lie the simplification of thought about past events that leads to the expansion of thoughts about present events. I will be the first to admit that these last comments give free run to the imagination. However, knowledge never becomes a resource until it is married to imagination. It is thus . . . that the scientific legacy of Apollo will be realized.” Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Marshall Space Flight Center Director and former Apollo Program Director, reported the status of the five scientific stations deployed on the moon during the Apollo program: The first station deployed by Apollo 12, in November 1969, “is still functioning over 3 years after its initial deployment in the very demanding environment of the Moon. . . . The fact that this equipment can stand these rigors of temperature and vacuum . . . and still function . . . demonstrates one facet of the technology we have developed.” All five stations were still functioning, though some of the experiments had been lost. The first total station, on Apollo 12, had been designed for a one-year life. “And yet we have had it over 3 years . . . and the seismometers worked beautifully all 3 years.” The superthermal ion detector was “working beautifully and had for 3 years, night and day.” NASA had “five seismic units just giving us beautiful information on the seismic tremors of the Moon and meteorite impacts, so now we can locate them fairly accurately.” Dr. Charles A. Berry, Director of Life Sciences in OMSF, reported: “We are vastly wiser in many medical and technical areas for our ‘decade in space.’ Much has been learned about the effects of the space flight environment upon man. We have found that some body systems respond to space flight factors . . . with changes . . . observable in the period immediately following space flight. Occasionally changes have been noticeable during the inflight period of the mission. None of these changes has been of such a severity as to cause any real concern for man’s safety in space, but all changes are . . . being watched closely lest they have implications for long duration flight.” Cardiovascular responses which showed the greatest changes also appeared most amenable to regulation by inflight countermeasures, such as lower body negative pressure. Medication had not proved of value in treating either the cardiovascular deconditioning or the loss of exercise capacity. Countermeasures were also being investigated for the small bone density losses noted. A decrease in heart size had been noted in both U.S. and Soviet space crewmen and some Soviet crewmen had experienced postflight muscular difficulties. “Both astronauts and cosmonauts have also reported sensations resembling sea sickness during spaceflight. On the whole, however, U.S. astronauts do not appear to be excessively plagued by motion sickness symptoms. The growth of opportunistic microorganisms appears to be favored in the space environment.” (Transcript)
Findings that the Aug. 4, 1972, solar storm—the largest ever recorded— had caused a small but measurable increase in the length of a day on earth were reported in Nature by Goddard Institute for Space Studies research associate Stephen Plagemann and John Gribben, an astronomer employed by Nature. Examination of U.S. Naval Observatory data had shown a daily increase in the day’s length 10 times greater than usual between Aug. 4 and Aug. 8, indicating that the earth’s rotation had slowed down fractionally. After a few days, the rotation rate had returned to its normal level. (Nature, 5/4/73, 26)
NASA and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics held a joint press briefing at Johnson Space Center on the commercial benefits from Skylab electronics technology. Robert H. Webster of Ampex Corp. said that the 28-track, high-reliability earth resources experiment package tape recorder developed for the Skylab missions was being tested for use by auto and truck manufacturers. Airlines and heavy equipment manufacturers were using it because of its environmental strength. Thomas H. Kenton, Westinghouse Regional Vice President for the Southwest, said that Westinghouse had manufactured two sensitive, low-light-level TV cameras for Skylab. The cameras could operate at light intensities 500 million times less than typical studio lighting conditions and equal to the light level of a dark moonless night. The cameras could be used for commercial TV camera systems. (Transcript)
The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin editorial commented on the name change of Manned Spacecraft Center to Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center: “While the U.S. is cutting back its spending in space, this nation and the world can never forget the adventure and exploration of the Sixties and the person largely responsible, after John F. Kennedy’s death, for getting man to the moon.” It was therefore “appropriate that Mr. Johnson be honored. ... At one point Mr. Johnson was reported to have called the creation of NASA his ‘proudest’ legislative achievement as a congressman. The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center will keep that achievement alive.” (P Bull, 2/23/73)
President Nixon issued Executive Order 11726 from San Clemente, Calif., establishing a Federal Office of Energy Policy. He announced the appointment of Colorado Gov. John A. Love as its Director and released a statement outlining a $ 10-billion, five-year program for energy research and development. The President established a goal for the next 12 mos for energy consumption reduction of 5% nationwide, and 7% within the Federal Government. {PD, 6/7/73, 867—75) June 30:	A seven-minute, four-second, total solar eclipse, one of three seven-minute-plus total solar eclipses in the 20th century, began at sunrise in Brazil and crossed Guyana, Surinam, the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Verde Islands, Mauretania, Mali, Algeria, Niger, Chad, the Central African Republic, Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and the Somali Republic. It ended at sunset in the Indian Ocean between India and Madagascar. A partial eclipse was visible for 3200 km (2000 mi) on both sides of the totality track. Previous total solar eclipses had been June 8, 1937, for seven minutes four seconds, and June 20, 1955, for seven minutes eight seconds. The next solar eclipse in the current “saros,” or 18-yr period, would be July 11, 1991, for 6 minutes 54 seconds, but the June 30 eclipse’s duration would not be exceeded for 177 years, British astronomer Peter MacDonald said later in a New Scientist article. The African eclipse was witnessed by an estimated 5000 amateur astronomers and tourists and by 2500 international scientists on land, on sea, and aboard research aircraft. Concorde 001, the specially instrumented Anglo-French supersonic transport aircraft, carried seven U.S., U.K., and French scientists across North Africa in lunar shadow at altitudes to 17 000 m (56 000 ft) during a two-hour six-minute flight. They observed total eclipse conditions for 74 min. The Skylab 1 Workshop, unmanned since Skylab 2’s June 22 splashdown, saw only about 10% of the eclipse because its orbital position and telescope mechanisms were not suited for maximum effectiveness. Its cameras operated from 7 am edt until midnight, and eclipse films taken would be retrieved by Skylab 3 astronauts scheduled for July 27 launch. Other scientific observations of the eclipse by at least 28 nations included an instrumented U.S. Air Force aircraft and rockets fired from the Soviet research ship Professor Vize near the Cape Verde Islands [see May 29]. Univ. of Texas observations by telescopes in the Sahara desert tested Einstein’s theory of relativity by measuring the bend of the sun’s gravity.

A series of calibration rocket (calroc) launches at White Sands Missile Range during the manned Skylab 2 mission scheduled for May would provide a reference for the calibration of equipment used in two experiments on Skylab’s Apollo Telescope Mount (atm), Marshall Space Flight Center announced, calroc launches were also scheduled during the Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 missions. The rockets would acquire solar flux data on specific regions of the sun in conjunction with. Skylab astronaut observations of the same regions with ATM experiments. Instrumentation on calroc would be similar to but smaller than that aboard the atm. Black Brant VCs would be used for all the launches. Taking part in the program, managed by MSFC, were Goddard Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center, the Naval Research Laboratory, Harvard College Observatory, and White Sands Naval Ordnance Missile Test Facility, (msfc Release 73-42)

Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomers—using the 610-mm (24-in) telescope and coude spectrograph at Table Mountain Observatory, Calif.— had found that a 20% fluctuation in carbon dioxide absorption was a recurring four-day phenomenon in the thick Venus cloud bank, NASA announced. The top of the cloud deck might move up and down more than one kilometer (two thirds mile) in a constant wave motion. The astronomers had said the observation was “a fundamental feature of atmospheric dynamics that is not explained by current theories of atmospheric circulation on Venus.” (NASA Release 73-97)

French hydrogen bomb testing in the Pacific was “a moral outrage and a diplomatic embarrassment,” a Washington Post editorial said, “but it is also a political fact, and one likely to become more rather than less important as the 1970s unfold.” As a strategic weapon the French nuclear striking force was relatively elementary, lacking warheads to fit into long-range missiles, multiple warheads, long-range missiles, and missile-carrying submarines. “As a political force, however, the force de frappe is quite real. As [the late President Charles] de Gaulle intended, it is virtually certain to give France a larger voice in the evolution of European affairs than it otherwise would have.” (W Post, 3/5/73, 26) May 3-4:	European Space Research Organization (esro) representatives met with U.S. space officials in Washington, D.C., to negotiate a draft Intergovernmental Agreement and draft a nasa-esro Memorandum of Understanding.

Newspaper editorials commented on the safe Sept. 25 return of Skylab 3. Baltimore Sun: The mission had been “an immense scientific success which produced unprecedented and extremely valuable data especially on solar activity.” It would be “mere superstition to believe nature is co-operating with man by producing solar flares and comets just when we would most like to have them. But the Skylab missions so far have had a lot of good luck.” (B Sun, 9/27/73, A14) Miami Herald: “All told, the Skylab missions appear to promise rewards even greater than the enlargement of knowledge created by the Apollo moon voyages. The outreach of the human mind is inexorable.” (M Her, 9/27/73) Chicago Sun-Times: “With casual aplomb, the astronauts performed their sophisticated experiments, floated weightlessly through, outside and around the Skylab, and fixed their spacecraft like mundane mechanics when something went haywire. It all seemed so routine. In the austere domain of space, as on Earth, how quickly does the miraculous become absorbed into the commonplace.” (C Sun-Times, 9/27/73) Christian Science Monitor: “Even those most intimately involved with the space program, slated now for more international participation as well as applause, would admit we may now but dimly grasp the full significance of our space sorties.” The names of the Skylab 3 astronauts would, nonetheless, be added “to the list of welcomed home heroes of mankind’s young space chapter.” (CSM, 9/27/73) Philadelphia Inquirer: “Space exploration has matured to space work. During 59 days in earth orbit—more than doubling the space flight record set earlier this year by three astronauts in the same Skylab—assignments were carried out with diligence and precision. Scientific experiments and observations could “produce long-range dividends, not immediately apparent.” Despite NASA’s extraordinary safety record space was “a hostile environment posing hazardous challenges to courageous men. But the richest rewards in space will come not from derring do but from workmanlike execution of assignments with down-to-earth relevance to needs of mankind.” (P Inq, 9/27/73)

The National Science Foundation released National Patterns of R&D Resources: Funds & Manpower in the United States 1953—1973 (nsf 73-303). Total U.S. research and development spending was expected to reach $30.1 billion in 1973, 3% above the $29.2-billion 1972 level. R&D was expected to account for 2.4% of the gross national product (gnp) in 1973, down from 2.5% in 1972 and 3.0% in peak year 1964. The Federal Government would support 53% of U.S. R&D in 1973, with about 70% concentrated in defense and space programs. Almost 40% of R&D spending in the U.S. was for research, with 1973 basic research expenditures estimated at $4.5 billion and applied research at $6.8 billion. Development spending was estimated at $18.8 billion. Colleges and universities would perform nearly three fifths of U.S. basic research, with industry leading in applied research and development. An estimated 525 000 R&D scientists and engineers were employed in the U.S. in 1972, 1% fewer than in 1971. Of these, nearly 70% were employed by industry. (Text)

Magnuson (D—Wash.) explained S. 2495, a bill to apply NASA’s expertise to solving domestic problems, during the first day of two-day hearings on the state of the aerospace industry by the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Sen. Magnuson, with Sen. Frank E. Moss (D-Utah) and Sen. John V. Tunney (D-Calif.), introduced the bill Sept. 27. The bill, the Technology Resources Survey and Applications Act, would amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to provide “an organization within NASA to carry out programs ... to resolve critical national problems. This would expand an activity already underway within NASA and enable us to better utilize a capability which has already exhibited an impressive record of success.” The programs would be determined by a National Technology Resource Council of Cabinet members and heads of technological agencies, which would make its recommendations to the President. Sen. Magnuson suggested changing NASA’s name to the National Applications of Science Administration. “I do believe the name . . . would accurately reflect the new role which my bill attempts to create for NASA.” Dr. Karl G. Harr, Jr., President of the Aerospace Industries Assn, of America, Inc., testified that foreign competition for U.S. and international aerospace markets was currently “of a scope, determination, and quality that we have not had to face since World War II. The underpinning of strong research and development programs—vital to our technological advance—is being downgraded to a serious degree. There is an alarming scarcity of private sources of financing for the development and production of new commercial aircraft. As a low-profit industry, traditionally averaging a profit about half that of other manufacturing industries, we lack the resources for reinvestment, cushioning against risk, and attracting investors. Above all, there is uncertainty in this transitional period about future national gods which might utilize our capabilities. Will we continue to contribute primarily to space exploration, defense, and long-range air travel, or will we next find ourselves emphasizing such efforts as environmental control, law enforcement, health delivery services, housing, and urban mass transit?” Dr. Wernher von Braun—Vice President, Engineering and Development, Fairchild Industries, Inc., and former NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning—testified on the future of satellite communications: “There is no field in which the goals of space applications are expanding at a faster rate.” Ever since NASA demonstrated “that radio signals bounced off passive reflection satellites such as the Echo balloon or rebroadcast by active repeater spacecraft such as Early Bird, worldwide communications by satellite have been growing. . . . Satellites, by providing international telephone and television service, are an important force in overcoming regional and national barriers. It is difficult to maintain hostility and isolation in the presence of free communications.” Satellite communications would “soon be commonplace in our country.” With the advent of the reusable space shuttle to service and repair satellites in the 1980s, “even nations with limited fiscal resources can put in a network of smaller, far less expensive ground stations.” Thanks to NASA programs initiated a few years ago, “the United States is still quite active in the area of pioneering new technology for communications satellites.” (Transcript) September 27—29:	The U.S.S.R. launched Soyuz 12, carrying cosmonauts l/c Vasily G. Lazarev and flight engineer Oleg G. Makarov, from Baykonur Cosmodrome at 5:18 pm local time (3:18 pm Moscow time; 8:18 am edt) into earth orbit with 229-km (142.3-mi) apogee, 180-km (111.8-mi) perigee, 88.6-min period, and 51.7° inclination. Soviet news agency Tass announced the objectives of the two-day mission were to test improved flight systems, test manual and automatic control in various flight conditions, and obtain spectrographic data of separate sections of the earth “for the solution of economic problems.” The flight would further improve development of manned spacecraft. After six hours in flight the cosmonauts reported they had adjusted to weightlessness and were carrying out all scheduled activities. All spacecraft systems were functioning normally. During the first day, Lazarov—45-yr-old air force test pilot and physician—and Makarov— 40-yr-old engineer who had taken part in developing the control board and flight program for Yuri A. Gagarin’s Vostok 1 mission of April 12, 1961—maneuvered their spacecraft in orbit to test manual and automatic control and piloting techniques. The spacecraft was moved into a higher and nearly circular orbit, with parameters reported by Tass as 345-km (214.4-mi) apogee, 326-km (202.6-mi) perigee, 91-min period, and 51.6° inclination. The cosmonauts also made spectrographs of natural formations of the earth’s surface. They were reported Sept. 28 to be in high spirits and good physical condition. Tass reported a new spacecraft design and a new spacesuit, “very simple and comfortable,” were being tested. Spacesuits were worn for launch and descent but not during the flight itself. On Sept. 29 the crew oriented their spacecraft and fired the braking engine. The landing module separated from the spacecraft and entered descent trajectory. The parachute system was deployed at 7.6 km (4.7 mi) above the earth and engines softlanded the craft 400 km (250 mi) southwest of Karaganda in the Kazakhstan Steppe at 2:34 pm Moscow time (7:34 am edt). A medical check at the landing site showed “the state of [the cosmonauts’] health is good.” Soyuz 12 was the first Soviet manned space flight since the 1971 Salyut 1-Soyuz 11 mission. Soyuz 10 (launched April 23, 1971, carrying three cosmonauts) had docked with the orbiting Salyut 1 space laboratory (launched April 19) but the cosmonauts had not boarded. American observers believed the Soyuz spacecraft had spun out of control, causing the cosmonauts to become ill and necessitating an early return to earth. Three cosmonauts launched June 6, 1971, on Soyuz 11 had docked with and boarded Salyut 1. They worked successfully in orbit for 24 days but were found dead on landing, from pressure loss in the landing craft, (gsfc SSR, 9/30/73; fbis-Sov, 9/28/73, Ul-A>; 10/1/73, Ul—3; SBD, 9/28/73, 138; Kaiser, W Post, 9/28/73, Al; Shabad, NYT, 9/30/73, 1; Seeger, W Post, 9/30/73, 145) September 27:	The Air Force launched an unidentified satellite on a Titan IIIB-Agena launch vehicle from Vandenberg Air Force Base into an orbit with a 384.6-km (239-mi) apogee, 128.8-km (80-mi) perigee, 89.8-min period, and 110.5° inclination.

A specially equipped United Air Lines, Inc., 727—200 jet transport aircraft was testing two-segment landing approach procedures to reduce noise levels near airport landing patterns in an Ames Research Center and Federal Aviation Administration cooperative program. The aircraft first descended at a steeper than usual glide-path angle. As the aircraft neared the runway and intersected the normal, shallow-approach flight path, the glide-path angle was decreased and the final landing made normally. A 67% reduction in the area disturbed by objectionable landing noise was expected to be achieved, (nasa Release 73-113)
