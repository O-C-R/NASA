Researchers led by Mikki M. Osterloo of the University of Hawaii announced in the journal Science that their team had found evidence of salt deposits on the surface of Mars. The scientists explained that the existence of salt deposits would provide evidence that Mars had once had an abundant supply of near-surface water, which could have sustained life. NASA’s Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System, a camera capable of producing images in visible light and infrared wavelengths, had made the discovery. The images showed spectral features consistent with chloride minerals, located at approximately 200 sites in the southern hemisphere. The salt deposits ranged in size from 0.5 square miles (1.3 square kilometers) to 25 times that size, with a thickness ranging from 3 to 10 feet (0.9 to 3 meters). Scientists believed that the mineral sites, which were approximately 3.5 to 3.9 billion years old, had formed when groundwater seeped to the surface and evaporated, leaving behind salty deposits.(NASA, “NASA Mission Finds New Clues To Guide the Search for Life on Mars,” news release 08-084, 20 March 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/mar/HQ_08084_Mars_Deposits.html (accessed 13 January 2011); David Mosher, “Newly Found Martian Salt Deposits Suggest Ancient Life,” Space.com, 20 March 2008, http://www.space.com/5150-newly-martian-salt-deposits-suggest-ancient-life.html (accessed 13 January 2011); M.

NASA announced that officials had ceased operations on the Phoenix Mars Lander after Lander stopped communicating with mission engineers on 2 November 2008. The project team had originally scheduled Phoenix for three months of operations, launching Phoenix on 4 August 2007 and landing it on Mars on 25 May 2008. NASA had extended its mission twice until, with the seasonal decline in sunlight, Phoenix’s solar arrays could no longer charge its batteries. During its mission, the US$428 million Lander had taken more than 25,000 pictures of Mars and had observed the planet’s soil and weather, looking for indications that Mars might have had an environment suitable for microbes in the past. Phoenix had documented falling snow on Mars; had found calcium carbonate, perchlorates, and salts deposits; had observed alkaline soil; and had verified the presence of two distinct types of water ice. The University of Arizona had led the Phoenix mission, and NASA’s JPL had managed the project.(NASA, “Mars Phoenix Lander Finishes Successful Work on Red Planet,” news release 08-284, 10 November 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08-284_Phoenix_Finishes_ Mission.html (accessed 22 August 2011); Kenneth Chang, “NASA Loses Contact with Mars Lander and Ends Its Mission,” New York Times, 11 November.)
NASA announced that it had selected a proposal for a robotic mission to Mars, a mission that would study the planet’s atmosphere, climate history, and potential habitability. Out of 20 proposals submitted, NASA had accepted the proposal of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder to build the US$485 million Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft. According to the proposal, MAVEN would begin orbiting Mars in the fall of 2014. Over the course of one Earth year, the craft would use its eight instruments to gather data, including a study of the upper atmosphere 80 miles (128.75 kilometers) above the Martian surface. Scientists would also be able to use MAVEN to relay support for robotic missions on the ground on Mars. NASA would provide the University of Colorado with US$6 million for mission planning and technology development, and Lockheed Martin would build the spacecraft. NASA’s GSFC would manage the MAVEN mission. MAVEN would be the second mission conducted by the Mars Scout Program—NASA’s series of small, low-cost, principal investigator−led missions to Mars.(NASA “NASA Selects Mission To Study Mars Atmosphere,” news release 08-233, 15 September 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/sep/HQ_08-233_MAVEN_Mars_mission.html (accessed 26 July 2011).)

After allowing some of the water to evaporate from a sample measuring 3 cubic centimeters (0.18 cubic inches), scientists had used Phoenix’s whirling rasp to grate the soil into the TEGA. The TEGA had analyzed the vapor that the sample released when heated to the melting point of 32°F (0°C), confirming the presence of water in the soil. The analyzer had also examined the sample while it was heating to 1,800°F (982.22°C). Although the Mars Odyssey spacecraft had first sighted ice on the planet’s surface while orbiting Mars in 2002, Phoenix’s test was the first chemical analysis to prove the existence of water ice on Mars. NASA announced that it planned to add 90 days to Phoenix’s original mission, extending the mission through 30 September 2008.(Kenneth Chang, “Test of Mars Soil Sample Confirms Presence of Ice,” New York Times, 1 August 2008; NASA, “NASA Spacecraft Confirms Martian Water, Mission Extended,” news release 08-195, 31 July 2008, http://www. nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jul/HQ_08_195_Phoenix_water.html (accessed 18 May 2008); David Perlman, “NASA Craft Probes Ice on Mars,” San Francisco Chronicle, 1 August 2008.)
NASA announced that its Phoenix Mars Lander had verified the presence of water ice in the Martian soil. Phoenix, which landed on Mars on 25 May 2008, had collected a soil sample from a 2-inch-deep (5.08-centimeter-deep) trench. Phoenix Mars Lander had dug the trench in the Martian polar region. The spacecraft had experienced difficulty moving the soil into the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer (TEGA) for testing, because the freshly dug soil samples had been
A team of researchers, led by Roger J. Phillips of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, announced in the online version of the journal Science that NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) had gathered evidence indicating that Mars’s lithosphere is colder and thicker than scientists had previously thought. Using the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) on the MRO, the researchers had produced the most precise pictures to date of the Martian crust and upper mantle below the polar ice cap. The ice cap on Mars is 1.2 miles (1.93 kilometers) deep and 310,000 square miles (802,896.31 square kilometers) wide. On Earth, the force of a similar weight would cause the lithosphere to sag, but the Martian lithosphere remains level and even. The crust’s rigidity implies that the planet’s interior is colder than scientists had previously thought, indicating that any aquifers of liquid water that may exist on Mars would lie deeper below the surface, closer to the planet’s warm core. The radar pictures also showed that the crust is composed of layers of icy dust, interspersed with layers of almost pure ice. The researchers believed that vacillations in Mars’s orbit had caused the planet’s climate to change, resulting in these layers. ASI, the Italian space agency, had produced the SHARAD. NASA’s JPL managed MRO for NASA’s SMD.(NASA, “NASA Satellite Finds Interior of Mars Is Colder,” news release 08-128, 15 May 2008, http://www.nasa. gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_08128_MRO_Mars_Temp.html (accessed 16 March 2011); Charles Q.

NASA’s Phoenix spacecraft made a successful landing in the Martian northern polar region, beginning a three-month mission to burrow into the soil of Mars in search of water ice and carbon-based compounds. Phoenix had launched on 4 August 2007 and had completed a 422- million-mile (679.14- kilometer) journey to reach Mars. Phoenix was the sixth spacecraft to land safely on Mars and the first craft since the 1976 Viking 2 to land without airbags. The spacecraft, built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems, was 7 feet (2.13 meters) tall and weighed 904 pounds (410.05 kilograms). It contained seven scientific instruments, including cameras, small chemistry labs, an 8-foot-long (2.44-meter-long) robotic arm, and a weather station. The Phoenix mission, which cost US$457 million, would be the first to collect water samples on another planet. The University of Arizona was leading the mission, in partnership with NASA’s JPL and Lockheed Martin in Denver. International contributors to the mission included CSA; the University of Copenhagen and the University of Aarhus, both in Denmark; the Max Planck Institute in 65 Germany; the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland; and the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
A team of scientists led by John W. Holt of the University of Texas at Austin announced in the journal Science that they had discovered large buried glaciers of water ice in the Hellas Basin on Mars. Using the Shallow Radar instrument on NASA’s MRO, the team had made radar soundings of the gently sloping geographical features known as aprons. Scientists had long puzzled over these features. The radio waves had passed through the aprons without a significant loss of strength, indicating that the area contains a thick layer of ice, covered by a thin layer of rocky debris. The velocity of the radio waves was consistent with the composition of water ice. The researchers believed that these glaciers are the largest deposits of ice on Mars outside the polar caps. Besides providing a possible source of water for human explorers, the glacial ice may have scientific value: on Earth, buried glacial ice has preserved a record of ancient organisms and a history of the planet’s climate.(NASA, “NASA Spacecraft Detects Buried Glaciers on Mars,” news release 08-304, 20 November 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08-304_MRO_BuriedGlaciers.html (accessed 22 August 2011); see also John W.

A team of researchers announced in the journal Science that they had found on Mars soil deposits composed of more than 90 percent silica. NASA’s Spirit rover had found the deposits in the Columbia Hills in Mars’s Gusev Crater. Initially, scientists had used Spirit’s Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) and Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer to identify a pure silica deposit in the groove that Spirit’s broken front wheel had made as it dragged through the dirt. Subsequently, they had found other silica deposits nearby. On Earth, pure silica forms from the interaction of hot water and rock. Therefore, the scientists believed that these deposits might indicate that Mars had possessed hydrothermal vents in its ancient past. Because hydrothermal vents support microbial life on Earth, scientists believed that similar vents on Mars might also have hosted life.(Andrea Thompson, “Hydrothermal Vents on Mars Could Have Supported Life,” Space.com, 23 May 2008, http://www.space.com/5374-hydrothermal-vents-mars-supported-life.html (accessed 16 March 2001); see also S. W. Squyres et al., “Detection of Silica-Rich Deposits on Mars,” Science 320, no. 5879 (23 May 2008): 1063−1067.)
At the American Geophysical Union’s Fall Meeting, a team of scientists led by Bethany L. Ehlmann of Brown University announced that they had found carbonate minerals in Martian bedrock. The team had used the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on NASA’s MRO to observe carbonate exposures in the Isidis basin, particularly along the trough system known as Nili Fossae. Carbonates form when carbon dioxide and water interact with calcium, iron, or magnesium in volcanic rocks. Because carbonates dissolve quickly in acid, their presence indicated that Mars had once possessed neutral or alkaline water. A nonacidic environment would have favored ancient life forms. Previous researchers had found carbonates in Martian soil or dust, but the presence of carbonates in bedrock indicated that they might have formed over extended periods during Mars’s early history. The journal Science planned to publish the study’s findings in its 19 December 2008 edition.(NASA, “Scientists Find ‘Missing’ Mineral and Clues to Mars Mysteries,” news release 08-331, 18 December 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/dec/HQ_08-331_Mars_minerals.html; see also Bethany L. Ehlmann et al., “Orbital Identification of Carbonate-Bearing Rocks on Mars,” Science 322, no. 5909 (19 December 2008): 1828−1832.)
A team of scientists reported in the journal Nature that they had gathered new evidence to support the theory that Mars’s Borealis Basin is a large impact crater. After NASA’s Viking spacecraft had captured the first clear images of the Martian surface in the 1970s, scientists had puzzled over the dichotomy of the planet: the roughly cratered southern highlands have an altitude 2.5 to 5 miles (4.02 to 8.05 kilometers) higher than the smooth plains of the northern lowlands. One theory that scientists had advanced to explain this dichotomy was that the impact of a foreign object had created the lowlands of the Borealis Basin. However, many in the scientific community had doubted this theory because the images from the 1970s suggested that the basin did not have the typical shape of an impact crater. In the article in Nature, NASA’s MRO and NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor teams reported that they had gathered new topographical and gravitational data, showing that the basin has an elliptical shape consistent with that of impact craters. Moreover, two other studies published in the same Nature issue had used computer models to demonstrate that a meteor might conceivably have created the Borealis Basin. Scientists estimated that an object 1,250 miles (2,011.68 kilometers) wide, traveling at a speed of approximately 20,000 miles (32,186.88 kilometers) per hour, could have formed the crater when it crashed into Mars. If this theory proved correct, the Borealis Basin would be the largest known impact crater in the solar system.(NASA, “NASA Spacecraft Reveal Largest Crater in Solar System,” news release 08-159, 25 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08159_Mars_crater.html (accessed 21 April 2011); Kenneth Chang, “Astronomers Explain Mars’s Lopsided Shape,” New York Times, 26 June 2008; see also Jeffrey C.)
A team of scientists led by Janice L. Bishop of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute announced in the journal Science that they had found geological evidence that water, and possibly microorganisms, had been present in Mars’s Mawrth Vallis region in the past. Using NASA’s MRO’s Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), the scientists had studied the layers of sediment comprising the 4 billion-year-old clay deposits of that region. The top layer of clay, which contained many aluminum deposits, had probably formed in a wet environment when other minerals were leached from the soil leaving large amounts of aluminum behind. Immediately below the top layer containing aluminum-rich clay was a layer of silica opal. Clay rich in reduced iron formed a still lower layer. A large body of water interacting with a lakebed of basaltic ash or rock probably formed the lowest layer, which is composed of iron and magnesium smectites. Bishop’s team noted that, on Earth, the actions of microorganisms frequently cause iron reduction in the soil. However, the team also stated that other forces could have been responsible, on Mars.(Andrea Thompson, “Clays Shed Light on History of Mars Water and Possibly Life,” Space.com, 7 August 2008, http://www.space.com/5709-clays-shed-light-history-mars-water-possibly-life.html (accessed 20 July 2011); see also Janice L.
