Remotely controlled tests by Ames Research Center of a modified Russian planetary rover, Marsokhod, are planned for February 13-18 in a volcanic area that resembles the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. The test site is in Kilauea Volcano�s summit caldera and southwest rift zone on the island of Hawaii. Marsokhod, which combines the Russian rover chassis with western avionics, is a sophisticated prototype of a long-distance rover. (NASA Release 95-14)
NASA�s telescope on its Kuiper Airborne Laboratory has begun to examine the chemical composition of Mercury, which is the least understood of the four terrestrial planets-Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Flying at 41,000 feet, the specially outfitted C-141 military transport plane is able to detect invisible infrared radiation that is refracted and reflected by the planet�s surface rocks. While nothing startling was immediately about the planet�s surface, weeks or months of analysis are likely to turn up new information about Mercury. (NY Times, May 16/95; Fla Today, Jul, 9/95)
The Hubble Space Telescope serves as an interplanetary weather satellite for Mars and Venus. It shows that the Martian climate has changed since Viking visited Mars in the mid-1970s. The planet is now cooler, clearer, and drier. Venus continues to recover from an intense shower of sulfuric �acid rain� triggered by a suspected volcanic eruption in the late 1970s. Such knowledge of weather is critical to the planning of future missions to these planets. They also make natural laboratories for testing computer models that will lead to a general theory of the behavior of planetary atmospheres. The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). (NASA Release 95-31; Fla Today, May 14/95; AvWk, Mar 27/95; Science, Mar 31/95)
The 1,700 lb., $1.7 million robot Dante II, built by Carnegie Mellon University scientists, took gas samples and video pictures of the Spurr volcano in Alaska. The research is aimed at proving that cheap robots can be used on dangerous missions on Mars. (Bus Wk, Jan 9/95)
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory selected Lockheed Martin Astronautics to develop two small spacecraft that will explore Mars in 1998. They will be half the weight and cost of the 1996 Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Pathfinder. Their low weights of the new orbiter and lander will allow them to be launched on a new launch vehicle called the Med-Lite, which is being developed by McDonnell Douglas.

The Mars robot, that will land around July 4, 1997, will be named after �Sojourner� Truth, who advocated the right for all people to be free. (NASA Release 95-112; NY Times, Jul 16/95; AP, Jul 14/95)
Four more missions have been selected for NASA�s Discovery program. Formally started in NASA�s FY 1994 budget it features small planetary exploration spacecraft with focused science goals that can be built in about 36 months for about $150 million. Lunar Prospector was judged mature enough to proceed, while missions to study the Sun, Venus, and a comet (mission Stardust) were selected for further detailed study. Two missions are already under development in the Discovery program: the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission(which would orbit the asteroid Eros in 1999(and the Mars Pathfinder, which would land on Mars in 1997.

A 600 pound, solar power aircraft named Pathfinder set a new altitude record of 50,500 feet. The remotely-controlled vehicle is being evaluated by NASA and industry for environmental sampling missions. (NASA Release 95-152; AvWk, Sep 18/95 & Sep 25/95)
