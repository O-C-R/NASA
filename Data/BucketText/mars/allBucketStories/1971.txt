Text of Dr. Wemher von Braun interview by West German magazine Der Spiegel was released to U.S. press, nasa Associate Administrator for Planning was convinced that in 20 yrs “we shall have reached the point where space travel will earn more than it is costing.” Earnings from “bread and butter programs”—comsats, weather-monitoring spacecraft, and ers satellites—could pay for permanent lunar bases and manned exploration of Mars. “Most important product of the seventies” would be application of “all that the space program has taught us.” (Wilford, NYT, 2/21/71, 75)
Mariner 9, en route to Mars on orbiting mission, successfully completed first midcourse maneuver with 5.11-sec burn that produced 6.7-m-per-sec (15.1-mph) velocity change. Maneuver placed Mariner 9 on trajectory that would approach to within 1600 km (1000 mi) of Mars; second maneuver would be conducted Oct. 24 if necessary to correct trajectory further. Spacecraft had traveled 21 779 000 km (13 533 000 mi) since launch May 30 and was 2 076 000 km (1 290 000 mi) from earth, traveling at 10 985 km per hr (6826 mph). It was scheduled to reach Mars vicinity Nov. 13. (nasa Releases 71—96, 71-100)
Countdown for launch of nasa’s Mariner-I spacecraft toward Mars orbit was interrupted by hold at 4:59 pm edt 72 min from launch. Hold was caused by difficulty in interpreting data from Centaur stage guidance package. Difficulty was not resolved by 6 pm and launch was postponed to next day. (NASA Proj Off)
Mars orbit of Mariner 9 was changed by 17-sec engine firing to compensate for effects of dust storm on mission objectives. Periapsis was raised from 1388 km (862 mi) to 1650 km (1025 mi) to expand area covered in mapping photos and to provide required overlapping of pictures. Mapping would be completed in three 20-day cycles with fourth cycle available to fill in open areas where photos did not overlap. Period was increased by 1 min 19 sec to place periapsis in middle of Goldstone viewing period for maximum data return, (nasa Release 71—252; Pasadena Star-News, 12/31/71)
Flight path of Mariner 9, en route to Mars, was reported sufficiently precise for orbital insertion without scheduled second midcourse correction. Next critical event for Mariner 9 would be Mars orbit insertion Nov. 13, when spacecraft would begin to collect atmospheric and surface data and map 70% of Martian surface during 90 days in orbit. At 9:00 am edt, after 142.4 days in flight, Mariner 9 was 88 847 850 km (55 207 500 mi) from earth. Spacecraft was traveling at 59 220 km per hr (36 800 mph) relative to earth and had traveled total distance of more than 349 452 100 km (217 139 500 mi) since May 30 launch. (nasa Proj Off)
AP quoted NASA Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs John P. Donnelly as saying NASA was not releasing some information on Soviet space program received through official channels. Clampdown was being made at U.S.S.R’s request and through “bilateral agreement.” AP said Donnelly had forbidden NASA engineers who had returned from NASA-Soviet Academy of Sciences meeting on compatible docking system Nov. 29—Dec. 7 in Moscow to talk to press. Text of message telexed by Soviet scientists to nasa at JPL during exchange of Mars 2 and 3 and Mariner 9 information would be withheld at Soviet request. Soviet scientists had sent three such messages. (NYT, 12/16/71, 27)
Mariner 9 photographed Martian plateau from 6500-km (4000-mi) altitude. Photo, released by jpl Dec. 29, showed area 120 km (75 mi) square in Phoenicis Lacus region, covered with fault lines and resembling wrinkled elephant hide. Faults and scarcity of craters suggested region was volcanic and relatively young geologically. (AP, B Sun, 12/30/71, A5; Miles, LA Times, 12/30/71)
nasa held Mariner 9 pre-encounter news briefing at nasa Hq. Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, and Robert H. Steinbacher, Mariner Project scientist at jpl, described mysterious yellow dust storm—greatest observed since 1956—that had developed on Mars Sept. 23 and 24 and was first detected through telescopes Sept. 26. Steinbacher said, “The question as Mariner goes into orbit ... is, will we be doing mapping or covering some dynamic atmospheric phenomenon. . . .” It would be fortuitous “if, with the cameras and other instruments of Mariner 9, we catch the most dramatic event on Mars.” (nasa Release, 10/20/71; Haughland, W Post, 10/30/71, A3; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 10/30/71, A3)
National Urban Coalition released Counterbudget—A Blueprint for Changing National Priorities, 1971-1976. Report noted diminishing public support for science and technology and recommended 4% increase in r&d funding to prevent deterioration of Government’s role in science and technology in national affairs. Space program should be kept at funding level just over $3 billion, rather than $5.9-billion level reached in 1966. Space shuttle and station programs should be continued but on stretched schedule. Mars mission should be undertaken only when it could be done internationally. Value of space program as whole lay in its scientific yield, practical results, and national leadership.

Marine* 9, launched, from the Eastern Test Range on a 398-million-fdlometer (247-million-mile) direct-ascent trajectory, headed toward the planet Mars. Encountering Mars Nov. 13, the spacecraft would be the first to orbit a planet other than earth. Mariner 9—weighing 1000 kilograms (2200 pounds) and spanning almost 7 meters {22% feet) with its solar panels extended—would orbit Mars 90 days to study the atmosphere and surface in detail and map 70 percent of the surface. during 1971 opportunity; Mariner 8 (Mariner-H) launch attempt May 8 had failed because of malfunction in Centaur stage of booster. Scheduled for arrival at Mars on Nov. 14, Mariner 9 would make detailed study of Martian surface and atmosphere and map 7G^o of surface during planned 90-day orbit of planet. Launch vehicle performance and spacecraft injection were nominal. Spacecraft separated from Centaur, deployed four solar panels at 6:40 pm, and locked sensors on sun at 7:16 pm, soon after leaving earth’s shadow. About four hours into flight Canopus sensor was energized and spacecraft rolled 55° and locked onto star Achernar. Canopus acquisition was achieved at 10:26 pm and spacecraft would remain in sun-Canopus orientation for mission except during maneuvers. All spacecraft systems were operating normally. Mariner 9 weighed 1000 kg (2200 lb) at launch and carried six scientific experiments: infrared radiometer to measure surface temperature; uv spectrometer to investigate composition and structure of atmosphere; infrared interferometer spectrometer to measure surface and atmospheric radiation; S-band occultation experiment to study pressure and structure of atmosphere; TV cameras to transmit low-and high-resolution photographs of surface; and experiment to investigate Martian gravity field. Orbit of spacecraft was designed to guarantee it would not hit Mars for at least 17 yrs, to avoid contamination of planet before studies on surface were made by landing spacecraft. ossa assigned project responsibility to Jpl, including mission operations and tracking and data acquisition. Launch vehicle was responsibility of Lenc, with contractor General Dynamics Corp. Convair Division, (nasa Proj Off; nasa Release 71—75) May 30-June 6: Apollo 14 Astronauts Alan B.

Mariner 9, en route to Mars, was 7 900 000 km (4 909 000 mi) from earth at 9:00 am edt after traveling 82 500 000 km (51 263 000 mi) and receiving over 500 commands since launch May 30. Spacecraft was expected to accomplish its basic 90-day scientific mission objectives, but was using more nitrogen gas than predicted for maintaining attitude stabilization. Current predictions indicated nitrogen gas supply would be depleted in early August 1972, nine months after spacecraft went into orbit around Mars. Increased rate of consumption was due to circuit design error in attitude-control-system electronics. (nasa Proj Off; nasa Release 71-120)
Bemaining “puzzles” of solar system pattern were discussed by Walter Sullivan in New York Times article: General assumption was that sun, planets, and moons had been formed from “swirling, flattened cloud of material.” But: “Why does Mars have two tiny moons, each only a few miles in diameter, yet our moon is a quarter the diameter of the earth? Why do some of the outer moons of Jupiter go the ‘wrong way’—counter clockwise—around that huge planet? Why is the earth’s moon formed of a different mix of elements from that constituting the earth?” Recent information had “illuminated these questions though it had not resolved them.” Earth’s moon was giving off “far more heat than had been predicted on the basis of assumptions of how it was formed.” Mariner 9 photos of the two Mars moons had shown both to be irregular chunks “rather than systematically spherical bodies in the manner normally attributed to moons and planets.” George Washington Univ. scientist J. Martyn Bailey had proposed that all seven of Jupiter’s outer moons were asteroids captured by that planet’s powerful gravity and that Jupiter’s clockwise moons had been captured when planet was farthest from sun, while counter-clockwise moons had been captured when Jupiter was nearest sun. Lunar Science Institute scientists had agreed there had been sufficient sorting and layering on earth’s moon to produce radioactive crust that could account for heat flow. Information on two Martian moons had indicated that Phobos and Deimos looked much like asteroidal fragments but that did not prove that they were captured asteroids. They could have been formed as spherical moons from material left when Mars was being created and later “battered into their irregular shapes.” (NYT, 12/5/71, 4:8)
Launching of eight Soviet Cosmos satellites, Mars 2, and Mariner 9 had raised number of man-made objects in space to 2378, Reuters reported. Of total, little more them one fifth were satellites or payloads; remainder was space junk. Spokesman for usaf Air Defense Command had said usaf had recorded 2840 objects, 760 payloads, and 2080 bits of debris that had decayed since launch of Sputnik 1 Oct. 4, 1957. (LA Times, 6/17/71)
Findings on atmosphere of Mars from UV spectrometer observations made during NASA’s 1969 Mariner flyby missions were reported in Science by Univ. of Colorado scientists Dr. Charles A. Barth and Dr. Charles W. Hord: “Mars . . . reflects sunlight in the ultraviolet, but it is the atmosphere, not the surface, that is responsible for the reflected light. Even though there are atmospheric scatterers in addition to the molecular scatterers, it is possible to relate the intensity of the scattered radiation with the atmospheric pressure. The variation of the pressure over the planet reveals the topography to vary over 7 kilometers [4Yz miles] in height and to be correlated with visible features. The carbon dioxide polar cap, in addition to being a cold trap for volatile gases in the atmosphere, may also be a very efficient absorption trap for nonvolatiles. This last property may make the cap a repository for gases produced by geological or biological activity.” (Science, 7/16/71, 197-201)
U.S. Patent No. 3 631 294 was awarded to Steven R. Hofstein, President of Princeton Electronics, Inc., for Lithicon, first electronic storage tube to record on silicon and silicon dioxide. Tube, with target area consisting of more than 10 million silicon storage elements, had been used by JPL to record Mariner 9 Mars photos, by airlines and Federal agencies to inspect parcels that might contain bombs; by hospitals for brief x-ray and sonar exposures, and by libraries to retrieve microfilmed publications.

Mariner 9 and Soviet Mars 2 and 3 race to Mars was “exciting race for knowledge and the fame of exploration, exemplifying the kind of peaceful competition the world needs,” Washington Evening Star editorial commented. “If Mariner 9 reveals half of what it was sent out to find, it will be worth much more than the $150 million it is costing.” (W Star, 11/24/71)
Pioneer-F, 250-kg (550-lb) spacecraft, was expected to be ready for launch from ETR in late February or early March 1972 and would fly by Jupiter in December 1973, nasa scientists announced at jpl press conference. Pioneer-G was to be launched in 1973 and fly past Jupiter in 1974. nasa Director of Planetary Programs Robert S. Kraemer said Pioneer flights would be “vital precursor” to future Grand Tour flights to outer planets. Pioneer spacecraft would be first to penetrate vast asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and first to study planet’s intense radiation belts. (Wilford, NYT, 11/17/71, 26)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 (launched May 19) and Mars 3 (launched May 28) were continuing to operate satisfactorily en route to Mars, Tass announced. By 6:00 am Moscow time (11:00 pm edt July 26) Mars 2 had completed 43 communications sessions and was 17 580 000 km (10 924 000 mi) from earth; Mars 3 had completed 38 sessions and was 16 400 000 km (10 190 000 mi) from earth. Data from Mars 2 and Mars 3 measurements of corpuscular beams of solar and galactic cosmic radiation had confirmed data from same measurements conducted by Lunokhod 1 lunar rover on moon.

The Russian Space Bluff by Leonid Vladimirov, Soviet engineer-journalist who had defected in 1966, had been published in U.K., AP reported. Book said Soviet space program had begun as series of publicity stunts to persuade West that U.S.S.R. had reached level of advanced technology equal to that of U.S. Vladimirov had said that U.S.S.R. knew “she could not beat America to the moon because she cannot build a moon rocket. Even today the Soviet Union cannot produce any significantly big jet nozzles.” Mid-1960 flights in Voskhod series had been short because spacecraft were overloaded earlier Vostok type with some equipment removed. Last-minute modifications had been engineering disgrace. (AP, W Star, 11/25/71, H7) On Nov. 27 Mariner 9 failed in attempt at closeup photograph of Martian moon Phobos. JPL ground controllers said spacecraft’s camera wasn’t pointed correctly when attempt was made. Orbit of Phobos was not known precisely enough to ensure getting photo. Successful photo of Phobos would have shown greater detail than recent picture of Deimos, Mars’ other moon, since Phobos was twice as large as Deimos and spacecraft passed 1600 km (100 mi) closer. Mariner 9 had photographed Phobos Nov. 13 from 150 000 km (93 000 mi) out. (O’Toole, W Post, 11/27/71, A4; W Star, 11/28/71, A6)
NASA held Mariner 9 press conference at JPL. Discussion centered on dust storm that had covered planet since mission began and on origin of Martian craters. Dr. Bradford A. Smith of New Mexico State Univ. said storm had begun 10 wks earlier, had reached peak of intensity in 5th wk, and was gradually but continuously clearing. Project scientists disagreed, however, how long dust would obscure Mars; predictions ranged from a few weeks to months. If storm continued throughout mission, primary objective might have to be changed. Dr. Smith explained prime objective “was to map 70 percent of the planet in high resolution. If the storm does not clear up immediately, it will not be possible to do that within the nominal mission. An alternative might be to focus on the phenomenon that we have on our hands; that is, the dust storm. And instead of studying it in bits and pieces and waiting for the planet to clear up ... to rearrange our sequences to make an all out study of this atmospheric phenomenon.” Failure to complete mapping as planned would not significantly affect Viking Mars landing mission because, with only slight degradation, Viking zone could be mapped in last half or last third of Mariner 9 mission. “Also Viking has the capability to keep its landers in orbit for as long as two months while it does the mapping . . . [and] the capability to do some photographic site selection even if there were no usable pictures returned from ’71.” Dr. Harold Masursky of U.S. Geological Survey described four high points on Mars, all with large summit craters, suggesting that they might be volcanic calderas. Great alignment of relatively young topographic highs with summit craters suggested that Mars was geochemically active—that in not too distant past there had been extensive volcanic activity. Similar features might be found at lower elevations; they would be of interest because they had been, and still might be, hot. Such volcanic sources had, according to most opinions, produced terrestrial atmosphere; that is, carbon dioxide and water had come from such volcanic vents. Dr. Masursky emphasized that volcanic theory was not agreed on; project scientists’ views ranged from “agreement, to skepticism, to outright disbelief.” Data on Mars moons Deimos and Phobos were described by Dr. James B. Pollack of ARC. Deimos was 12 by 13km (7% by 8% mi) and Phobos was 21 by 26 km (13 by 16 mi). Moons were “among the darkest objects in the solar system,” reflecting only about 5% of sunlight that fell on them. Moons’ darkness could be attributed to basalts or carbonaceous chondrites in soil. If scientists could determine reason for darkness, they would soon be able to determine whether moons were captured asteroids or remnants of material from which Mars was formed. (Transcript)

U.S.S.R.’s Mars 3, approaching Mars, had detected possible evidence of earth’s magnetic tail farther out in space than previously reported, Pravda article said. Both Mars 2 and Mars 3 had passed through area 19 million km (12 million mi) from earth, where they had detected magnetic field. When Mars 3 passed through area it recorded streams of charged particles whose velocities differed from those observed in solar wind. Soviet scientists speculated that particles of solar wind were mixed with those of earth’s magnetic tail. (NYT, 12/5/71, 9)
Washington Evening Star editorial commented on Administration’s New Technologies Opportunities Program [see Oct. 31]: Much was worthwhile, “especially the attempt to mount a genuine program of conversion from defense and space-related to socially useful technological emphasis.” But “purely economic objectives of the program are murkier, at least at present. Granted that this nation may be on its way, in a number of industrial fields, to losing the technological lead that for so long has been a mainstay of our economic strength. Does it follow that the answer, in high-technology fields like electronics and commercial aviation, is what one Presidential adviser has called ‘an unaccustomed set’ of supports and subsidies to industry?” Question contained “all the elements of explosive controversy, and the administration will be hard-pressed to make a convincing case.” (W Star, 12/6/71, A10) Scientist Steve Korn of TRW Inc. Viking biological instrument team described instruments being developed for $11-million experiments to be conducted by two Viking landers scheduled for 1976 Mars landing. Sophisticated units for four experiments to search for microscopic life on Mars would be among most complex systems ever flown aboard unmanned spacecraft. Experiments included heat release experiment to analyze Martian soil for photosynthetic life similar to plant life on earth; experiment that would add nutrient to solid sample and measure metabolic conversion; gas exchange experiment to monitor environment surrounding sample for changes in gaseous makeup that would indicate presence of living organisms; and light-scattering experiment to provide nutrient to soil sample and detect any increases in scattering attributable to growth of microorganisms. Also, three-legged probes would snap photos; study Martian atmosphere; return meteorological data, pressures, temperatures, wind, and humidity; report on Mars’ magnetic and physical properties; and check seismic events. Probes would be lowered by parachute and retrorocket after landers had obtained orbit in procedure designed to land them accurately in areas deemed most likely to be habitats for life.

Role of radioelectronics in space was described in Pravda by Soviet Academician V. Andreyanov: “Radioelectronics might be called the nervous system of cosmonautics. It links our planet by living threads with the spacecraft and apparatuses when they fly to Mars, work on the moon, or study the earth and circumterrestrial space, like the Salyut station. In less than 15 years, research into space and the nearest planets has not only stimulated the development of many fields of science and technology but has also been accompanied by the emergence of new fields of knowledge and technical methods. A ‘spacifica-tion’ of the sciences had been noted. Concepts which were earlier unusual have also appeared in radioelectronics: space radio communications, space telemetry and television, space radionavigation, and radio methods for studying celestial bodies and interplanetary space.” (fbis-Sov-7 1-123, 6/23/71, L5)
Tass announced that French equipment on Mars 3 (launched May 28) for investigating solar radio emission in one-meter-waveband experiment was functioning successfully.

National Geographic Society was quoted in Chicago Tribune as saying, Phobos, Martian satellite, was darkest body yet observed in solar system, “possibly because meteoroids had scoured it clean of reflecting dust.” (C Trib, 11/5/71)
Mars 3 probe was launched by U.S.S.R. from Baykonur at 8:26 pm local time (11:26 am EDT) into parking orbit from which it was injected into heliocentric trajectory toward Mars. Payload would supplement that of Mars 2, launched May 19. All instruments functioned normally. By 10 pm Moscow time (3 pm edt), Mars 2 was 2 495 000 km (1 550 000 mi) from earth and Mars 3 was 44 000 km (27 000 mi), Tass reported. Each satellite weighed 4650 kg (10 250 lbs) and had as prime mission objective complex research of Mars and its atmosphere. Tass said that Mars 3 carried instrumentation for exploration of Mars and neighboring space, for investigating solar radio emission in one-meter wave band in experiment developed and manufactured by French specialists in French-Soviet cooperative program, and for measuring characteristics of solar plasma and cosmic rays, (fbis—Sov— 71-104, 6/1/71, LI; SBD, 6/2/71, 69; Shabad, NYT, 5/29/71, 1)

Production of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and glycolic acid in uv tests under simulated Martian conditions indicated organic material was probably being produced by sunlight on Mars’ surface, jpl scientists Dr. Norman H. Horowitz, Dr. Jerry S. Hubbard, and Dr. James P. Hardy reported in Proceedings of National Academy of Science of USA. Same organic compounds were believed to have been precursors to biological molecules on primitive earth. Dr. Horowitz said findings, obtained from irradiation of fine soil and powdered glass samples by high-pressure xenon lamp and low-pressure mercury lamp, provided “most favorable indication for a possible Martian biological evolution that we have had in the last five years.” There were “still many uncertainties, however, which won’t be resolved until we land on the planet.” (Proceedings of NAS, 3/71, 574-8)
In international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched NATO’s Natosat 2 military comsat for usaf and NATO, Eole Cooperative Applications Satellite for France, Isis 2 cooperative U.S.-Canada ionospheric satellite, and Ariel 4 ionospheric satellite for U.K. Italian crew trained by NASA launched NASA’s Explorer 45 Small Scientific Satellite and Italy’s San Marco 3 from Italian platform off coast of Kenya. Joint NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences meetings on compatible spacecraft rendezvous and docking system progressed to discussion of possible joint test missions. Data obtained by NASA’s Mariner 9 and Soviet Mars 2 and 3 probes were exchanged under agreement that covered broad range of U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space science and applications. Agreement on future exchanges of medical and biological manned space flight data called for meetings between U.S. and Soviet experts at least annually. U.S. and U.S.S.R. exchanged Apollo 11 and 12 and Soviet Luna 16 lunar samples and Soviet scientists were among 750 experts attending Second Annual Lunar Science Conference at Lunar Science Institute in Houston. First U.S.-U.S.S.R. Conference on Communications with Extraterrestrial Intelligence was held in Soviet Armenia. Joint meeting of NASA and European Space Conference (esc) identified candidate areas for possible European participation in U.S. post-Apollo space programs, including design and development of space shuttle subsystems. International Workshop on Earth Resources Survey at Univ. of Michigan was cosponsored by NASA, Dept, of State, usn, and aid to inform representatives of 51 countries and international organizations of latest techniques for interpreting earth resources data acquired by aircraft and satellite remote sensing systems. nasa’s C-130 aircraft equipped with remote-sensing devices participated in U.S. survey of Jamaica’s natural resources undertaken at request of U.N. and Jamaican government. NASA signed agreement with West Germany for series of barium-ion-cloud (bic) probe launches, and new sounding rocket agreement was signed with France. Under sounding rocket agreement, 20 French Centaure and NASA Nike-Cajun rockets would be launched from Kourou Center, French Guiana, in cooperative France-U.S. upper-atmosphere research project. By end of year NASA had entered into cooperative agreements with 39 countries, including agreements on lunar samples, tracking and data acquisition, and geodetic satellite program. Scientists of 87 countries besides U.S. were participating in cooperative ground-based programs and personnel exchanges and 62 countries were exchanging scientific and technical information. Since the beginning of 1962, NASA had launched 21 satellites under international agreements, in addition to flying 21 international experiments on NASA satellites. Since the beginning of the sounding rocket program, 683 cooperative rockets had been launched for research, (nasa Release 71—245; NASA Int Aff; “Selected Statistics on Int’l Affairs,” 2/17/72; A&A, 1971)
New mission plan had been adopted for Mariner-I (Mariner 9) Mars probe scheduled for launch no earlier than May 29, NASA announced. New plan—which would provide high-quality data return for all of original experiments but less data than planned for original two-spacecraft mission—assigned 65° inclination, 12-hr period, and 1200-km (750-mi) periapsis (low point in orbit around Mars) to Mariner-I, with Nov. 14, 1971, arrival date. New inclination would yield map covering almost 70% of Mars and period would ensure two-tape-load-per-day data return. (NASA Release 71-94)
Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director of gsfc Institute for Space Studies, was quoted as saying in London that people often forgot intelligence factor in debate over manned versus unmanned space missions. Dr. Jastrow had pointed out that by time unmanned space exploration technology reached level of achievement already exhibited in manned exploration, lunar exploration—or even Martian exploration—might have advanced to stage of extended expeditions or space station. Then human performance would again have jumped ahead of machines. (Cowen, CSM, 2/11/71)
Mariner 8 (Mariner-H) Mars probe, launched by nasa from etr, Launch Complex 36, Pad A, at 9:11 pm edt, failed to enter orbit when Centaur stage of Atlas-Centaur booster malfunctioned after normal countdown and liftoff. Anomalies began to appear with Centaur main engine start. Centaur stage oscillated in pitch in diverging manner and subsequently tumbled out of control, engines shut down from starvation caused by tumbling, and Centaur and spacecraft separated and reentered earth’s atmosphere approximately 1500 km (900 mi) down range and 400 km (250 mi) north of Puerto Rico. Failure investigation team composed of LeRC, General Dynamics Convair Div., ksc, and jpl personnel had been established to determine cause of failure and recommend corrective action required before launching Mariner-I.

Detailed Tass description of Mars 2 and 3 missions with diagrams of spacecraft and landing procedures appeared in Soviet newspapers. Enroute to Mars, spacecraft had measured solar wind particle streams, measured parameters of interplanetary magnetic fields, determined electron concentrations in interplanetary medium, studied solar radio emissions with Soviet-French Stereo-1 experiment, and studied spacial structure, directivity, and mechanism of radiation processes. In Mars orbit spacecraft had investigated Mars solar wind flow and its interaction with Mars ionosphere, recorded spectrum of charged particles and variations in magnetic field, and measured refraction of radiowaves. Mars 3 descent package had transmitted pictures only briefly after landing on Mars surface Dec. 2, Tass said: “At the computed time, the transmission of video pictures was begun and continued for about 20 sec. During that period a small part of a panorama was transmitted in which no discernible details were detected because of [the lack of] contrast. Now, it is still difficult to say what caused the termination of the transmission. It is possible that it was associated with the local peculiarities in the landing area, which are completely unknown, or with the dust storm raging at the time. Apparently the dust storm acted as a ‘veil’ covering the surface details during the panoramic exposure. The sudden cessation of signals made it impossible to obtain information from the scientific equipment.” Orbiting vehicle carried infrared radiometer, two TV cameras, photometer, and instruments to measure CO2 and determine water vapor content, surface radio-brightness temperature, and atmospheric density.

NASA announced it had issued Management Study of NASA Acquisition Processes, report of team established in September 1970 to review NASA project and program planning for R&D and activities and procedures for acquiring goods and services from definition of requirements through contract award. Report covered processes used for acquisitions leading to use of formal source evaluation boards for agency-level and field center-level source selections. Study group had concluded that basic framework of NASA acquisition process was sound, but it recommended some improvements in project planning, source solicitation, and source selection, (nasa Release 71—118; Text) jpl astronomer Dr. Donald G. Rea said Jupiter was biggest enigma and challenge to most space scientists. It “emits about three times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. It has a magnetic field 20 times that of Earth, intense radiation belts, and apparently rotates at three different speeds. An important characteristic for flight projects is its gravity which will allow us to send a spacecraft to study Jupiter and then continue on” to investigate outermost planets of solar system. JPL scientist James E. Long recommended spacecraft be launched in 1981 for insertion into Jupiter orbit early in 1984 after 750-day trip from earth. “Depending on Jupiter’s radiation hazard, the spacecraft will have an active life in orbit of six months to a year.” It was “imperative that we get direct measurements well into Jupiter’s atmosphere over long periods . . . to determine the dynamic processes involved.” Technology for Thermoelectric Outer Planet Spacecraft (tops), sustained by self-repairing computers and capable of 10-yr scientific missions to outer planets, was described by jpl engineers Carl C. Wertz, Paul 0. Chelson, and Richard A. Easton, JPL computers being developed and tested were star (self-testing and repairing) and CATS (computer-aided telemetry system). Both had built-in redundancy, with backup parts for each unit that might fail. Easton said star computer was spacecraft’s brain and cats computer its nervous system. Selfrepairing computers were needed for outer planetary mission because “potentially hazardous environments, such as the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, or radiation from Jupiter itself, require that Grand Tour spacecraft subsystems be self-adaptive to either transient or permanent failures. Another consideration is the eight-hour roundtrip communications delay from Neptune or Pluto.” Leonard Jaffe, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications, received Lloyd V. Berkner Award, presented annually by aas to persons making significant contributions to commercial space utilization. aas Flight Achievement Award was presented to Astronaut John L. Swigert, Jr., for Apollo 13 crew. LaRC Director Edgar M. Cortright received aas 1970 Space Flight Award “in recognition of his contribution to space flight through early planning for the organization of NASA, his direction of the Lunar and Planetary Program, his influence while Deputy Associate Administrator of the Oflice of Space Science and Applications, and later the Office of Manned Space Flight and his current position as Director of nasa Langley Research Center.” In speech on technology crisis Cortright said: “It is ironic that after 10 years of ‘delivering the goods’ in an unparalleled manner, culminating in manned exploration of the Moon, the space program is fighting for its life with a host of other priority programs. Already the national team of Government, industry, and university scientists, engineers, and technicians has been reduced to about Yi of its peak of over 400 000. If we are not to see the progress of a decade of dedicated national effort squandered away, we had better make our case for space loud and clear. I think we have a compelling case—even in these days of relevancy.” (jpl Releases 577, 578, 579; NASA Activities, 7/15/71, 117; 8/15/71, 129-34; Langley Researcher, 7/19/71, 1; Boeing Release S-0826)
NASA telexed thanks to Soviet scientist Dr. I. A. Zhulin for “very informative transmission” of Mars 2 and 3 data that included description of instruments [see Dec. 21] and forwarded Mariner 9 UV spectrometer results. Message, signed by Mariner 9 Program Manager Dan Schneiderman, continued exchange between JPL and Moscow of information from U.S. and Soviet Mars probes. NASA requested more information on Soviet experiments and spacecraft on “detailed level . . . described in our icarus publication previously transmitted to you,” and said Mariner 9 photo of Mars 3 lander site area was being dispatched by diplomatic pouch. New value for direction of Mars polar axis based on dynamic considerations was included in NASA message to Moscow, nasa noted, “Although this will probably cause a revision of the Mars coordinate system at a later date, we will continue to observe the existing convention in describing the positions of visible surface features.” (NASA Release 71-254)
Baltimore Sun editorial commented on quantity of new scientific data to be expected from U.S. Mariner 9 and U.S.S.R. Mars 2 and 3 probes of Mars—data “certain to be gathered later if not now.” Whatever was learned, “the store of mystery held by the skies and even their nearest objects will remain enormous. . . . The admiration for man’s persistence in pitting his intelligence, skill, courage and inventiveness against the solar system’s magnificent teases is equaled by the folly of supposing we shall ever read any but a few of their overpowering riddles.” (B Sun, 11/17/71)
NASA released Jan. 28 briefing on FY 1972 budget request, in which Dr. George M. Low, NASA Acting Administrator, said: “For the past several years we have reported ... a further decrease in budget authority. This year we can report a clear halt in this trend: the budget authority for FY 1972 is at the same level as the funds appropriated for FY 1971. The exact figure for FY 1972 is $3,271 billion. NASA would complete Apollo program with four previously planned missions but would delay Apollo 17 five months to ensure that mission carried experiments originally scheduled for canceled Apollo 18 and 19. Skylab missions would be delayed about four months, to follow as soon as practical after last Apollo flight. Plans for unmanned planetary exploration included two Mars orbiters in 1971, Jupiter flybys in 1972 and 1973, launch in 1973 for Venus-Mercury flyby in 1974, and two Viking launches in 1975 to land on Mars in 1976. Dr. Low said NASA had asked for $190 million for space shuttle in FY 1972. “We have included in our budget $100 million. This reduction means essentially that we will move out with the engine development exactly as we had planned; that we are still in a position to make a decision after we have completed the studies on the air frame development, whether to continue with additional design or whether to proceed with the development of the air frames.” Near-earth science programs included Orbiting Solar Observatories in 1971, 1973, 1974, and 1975 and last orbiting Astronomical Observatory in 1972. Space applications program would progress as planned, including two erts, two Nimbus experimental weather satellites, two Synchronous Weather Satellites, and two advanced communications experiments with ATS—F and ATS—G. New FY 1972 projects would include start of work on High Energy Astronomy Observatory (heao) and program for exploration of outer planets. “To do this we will develop a versatile new spacecraft, and we will plan Grand Tour missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-1977; and to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, in 1979.” NASA also would study mission to orbit Jupiter as alternative to first Grand Tour. Major new initiative in aeronautics in FY 1972 would be development of experimental stol aircraft. Downward trend in aerospace industry employment on NASA programs would be halted during FY 1972. “Although aerospace jobs will continue to decline in FY 1971, we expect employment to start increasing by the middle of FY 1972, with the end-of-year level being about equal to that at the beginning of the year.” NASA would reduce civil service work force by 1500 positions by end of FY 1972, bringing total decrease to 6800 since July 1967. Work on NERVA nuclear rocket engine would be limited to “essentially long-lead time items,” preserving ability “to move forward . . . when the need arises,” without large expenditures in FY 1972. Program included “no plans at this time for a manned Mars landing mission.” (Transcript)
nasa published Mariner-Venus 1967, Final Project Report (nasa SP—190). In foreword, Project Manager Glenn A. Reiff said Mariner 5 (launched June 14, 1967, toward Oct. 19, 1967, flyby of planet Venus), apart from significant contributions to knowledge of deep space, had achieved secondary objective, “to gain engineering experience by converting a spare Mariner-Mars 1964 spacecraft into one that could be flown to Venus,” with substantial savings. Cost of mission had been 10% less than anticipated. (Text) During 1971: U.S. orbited 51 spacecraft in 29 launches—including Apollo 14 and 15 csms Kitty Hawk and Endeavor with lms Antares and Falcon and their S—IVB stages intentionally crashed onto moon. U.S.S.R. orbited 97 payloads in 83 launches; Japan, 2; U.K., 1; France, 1; Italy, 2 (1 for U.S. on U.S. booster); and Communist China, 1. U.S. total included 33 orbited by DOD in 17 launches and 19 by NASA in 13 launches. NASA’s total included 1 launched for USAF on behalf of NATO, 1 for France, and 1 for U.K. NASA’s manned space flight program continued with launches of Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 manned lunar landing missions. Mobile equipment transporter, used for first time on Apollo 14 to carry equipment and samples, allowed astronauts to explore 3.5 km (2.2 mi) of lunar surface and collect 43 kg (94.8 lbs) of samples. On Apollo 15, astronauts traveled 28 km (17.4 mi) over lunar surface on four-wheeled, battery-powered lunar roving vehicle (lrv) Rover and collected 77 kg (170 lbs) of lunar samples, including one white anorthosite rock about 4 billion yrs old. Unmanned program was highlighted by Mariner 9 Mars probe, which traveled 400 million km (248 million mi) to Mars and began transmitting photos of major Mars dust storm and, later, of details of Martian surface and moons Deimos and Phobos. Mariner 8 launch vehicle malfunctioned at launch. Oso 7 Orbiting Solar Observatory—rescued from initially incorrect orbit by ground command—made first x-ray observations of beginning solar flare and revealed that sun had “polar caps.” Other unmanned missions included lntelsat-IV F-2 and Intelsat-IV F—3 for ComSatCorp and Explorer 43, Explorer 44, and Explorer 45 (the last launched for NASA by Italy). Launched as secondary payloads were Subsatellite on Apollo 15 and Tetr 3 on Oso 7. All elements of Skylab flight system reached final manufacturing and checkout in preparation for 1973 launch and intensive engineering studies on Space Shuttle were conducted throughout year. In joint NASA—usaf lifting-body program, M2—F3 and X—24A lifting bodies made 17 flights, including first supersonic flight by M2-F3. X-24A reached 1687 km per hr (1048 mph) before completing program and beginning modification for new flight program as X—24B. In aeronautics NASA TF-8A jet aircraft with supercritical wing - made 27 successful flights. USN F-14 fighter aircraft successfully demonstrated first automatically programmable variable sweep wing. USA CH—54B helicopter set new world altitude record of 5120 m (16 798 ft) while carrying 10 000-kg (22 000-lb) payload. New v/stol Wind Tunnel at LaRC became operational, providing greatly improved testing capability for scaled models. GE quiet experimental engine successfully completed initial tests in NASA program to reduce jet engine noise, and NASA let competitive design contracts for development of quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (questol) transport U.S.-U.S.S.R. Space Activity, 1957-1971 Successful Launches to Earth Orbit or Beyond aircraft, sst program ended, with Congress voting to terminate program. In sounding rocket program, 126 successful flights were made to study atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomagnetic storms, meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations and to make astronomical observations in x-ray, uv, and radio regions of electromagnetic spectrum. DOD’s 33 payloads included orbiting of 2 Defense Satellite Communications System (dscs-2) military comsats, 2 ov—i scientific satellites, and Cannonball 2 and Mmketball. U.S.S.R.’s 83 launches set an all-time record in number of flights. The 97 payloads included 81 Cosmos satellites, 2 Luna, 2 Soyuz, 1 Salyut, 2 Mars, 1 Intercosmos, 4 Meteor, 2 Molniya I, 1 Molniya II, and Oreol (launched for France).

Apollo manned missions swelled storehouse of lunar information. Unmanned astronomical missions gathered unique data, including new clues to Martian atmosphere. NASA-developed inventions saw increased use beyond space exploration—in environmental sciences, communications, medicine, industry, and agriculture. U.S.—U.S.S.R. space meetings set stage for future joint space missions. And balanced program of space and ^aeronautics, despite low funding level, continued to raise U.S. prestige as aerospace pioneer while it worked to improve man’s future. Some observers, however, warned of higher rate of technological advances abroad than in U.S. and of ever-growing U.S.S.R. space program and technological capability. Soviet expenditures on space were estimated at level about double U.S. peak expenditure of l°/o of GNP when combined nasa-dod space program was at highest level and four times present level. Dr. James C. Fletcher was nominated new nasa Administrator by President Nixon. President of Univ. of Utah and former aerospace executive, Dr. Fletcher took office April 27. He succeeded NASA’s third Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, who had resigned Sept. 15, 1970, to return to industry. Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, had served as Acting NASA Administrator in the interim. Operating at lowest budget level since 1962, nasa in 1971 continued phase-out of Apollo program with successful completion of Apollo 14 and 15. Man’s fourth landing on moon, in Apollo 15 mission, proved to many that man had an effective scientific role in space. At year’s end, Apollo 16 had been scheduled for March 1972, with Apollo 17 to complete program later in year. Reduced funding forced additional reduction of personnel as well as program cutbacks, stretching out remaining Apollo missions, delaying first Skylab flight, and slowing studies of space shuttle, nerva nuclear rocket engine program was reduced to holding action. Bioscience funding was eliminated. Aerospace employment in industry throughout nation also fell, reflecting cuts in DOD spending as well as in NASA’s. During year, however, Skylab hardware manufacture neared completion and space shuttle work continued. Shuttle preliminary design contracts were extended so that nasa could examine alternative configurations, contingent on Administration approval of shuttle development. In erts program, aircraft tested remote sensing devices for gathering earth resources data and first satellite for global monitoring of resources was scheduled for 1972. During 1971, instrumented aircraft measured air pollution, investigated corn blight infestation, and sought hidden natural resources. Pioneer-F spacecraft for planned 1972 launch and December 1973 Jupiter flyby went into final manufacturer’s tests. Increased emphasis on aeronautics included research into aircraft noise reduction, increased air transport efficiency with use of supercritical wing, and STOL aircraft for transportation. To emphasize practical goals of space science, NASA established new Office of Applications, increased technology utilization budget from $1 million to $5 million, and issued request for proposals for additional uses of space-developed technology to solve problems of society. Among NASA projects were nsf contract to investigate use of solar cells to electrify homes and buildings and hud contract to study application of space technology to sewage recycling. Joint nasa-dot study resulted in recommendations for civil aviation R&d policy (card). Research achievements at NASA centers included ARC discovery of amino acids—building blocks of life—in second meteorite. Discovery strengthened case for chemical evolution of life elsewhere in universe. NASA FY 1972 appropriation of $3,298 billion was $27 million more than requested $3,271 billion and $29 million above FY 1971 appropriation of $3,269 billion—halting downward trend but far below 1965 peak of $5,250 billion.

Bochum Observatory in West Germany said it had received what appeared to be on and off switching signals from Soviet Mars probes, Mars 2 and 3. (AP, W Post, 11/19/71, A3)
Comments on U.S. Mariner 9 and U.S.S.R. Mars 2 and 3 missions were made in New York Times editorial: Three spacecraft—“one American and two Soviet—now speeding toward Mars represent the best type of international competition. Their rivalry centers about the pursuit of knowledge, with the honors going to that nation whose instruments send back the most important data on the red planet that is one of the earth’s nearest space neighbors.” U.S. led Mars race to date, “because of the brilliant feats by Mariners 4, 6, and 7. In the 1960’s the pictures and other data acquired by these pioneering vehicles completely revolutionized scientists’ views of the Martian terrain and environment.” (NYT, 6/1/71)
New York Times editorials commented on recent astronomical events— Nov. 26 Mariner 9 photographing of Martian satellite Deimos and Oct. 7 report by astronomer Dr. Hannes O. Alfven of discovery of asteroid Toro. Deimos’ photo was “only the latest of Mariner 9’s unique accomplishments. This is the first man-made artificial satellite of another major planet in the solar system and it has already journeyed more than a million miles around Mars.” Barring Mariner 9 malfunction, “lifting of the dust storm in the days ahead should permit even greater revelations of the nature of this planet that has been a mystery to man throughout the ages.” Evidence suggested asteroid Toro might crash into earth after 200 yrs, Times said. “Any such collision could do great damage. It may not be too early for space scientists to begin thinking about ways of nudging Toro out of a collision course with earth when, as and if the need arises. If men can send space ships across hundreds of millions of miles to Venus and Mars, it should be no great feat to visit Toro— a mere nine million miles [14 million kilometers] away at present closest approach—by way of performing whatever celestial engineering is required to prevent a mammoth cosmic traffic accident.” {NYT, 11/27/71, 30)
Lowell Observatory astronomers had made first accurate mapping of weather of Mars as result of worldwide cooperation of observatories in NASA-funded ground-based planetary patrol program centered at Lowell, Christian Science Monitor said. Principal investigator Dr. William A. Baum had said object of program, begun in 1969, was to “maintain nearly continuous photographic surveillance of Mars, Jupiter, and Venus during favorable periods.” Mars weather seemed analogous to weather in arid regions of earth. (CSM, 6/24/71)
Mariner 9, launched by NASA May 30, had covered 142 600 000 km (88 600 000 mi) in 167-day journey to Mars. Spacecraft was 15 300 000 km (9 500 000 mi) from earth and had received more than 600 commands, (nasa Release 71—136)
Hanna Reitsch, described by Washington Evening Star as “Nazi Germany’s famous daredevil woman test pilot and the only woman in German history ever to be given two Iron Crosses for her exploits,” told of her glider research during Star interview. “I am searching for the right currents over the Alps. I don’t have to worry about . . . borders in the air. ... As we enter space work more, we will realize how small mankind is and how necessary it is to come together in peace.” (Dean, W Star, 11/16/71, B7) nauts to Mars and return them safely to Earth in a total round-trip time of 60 days.” (A&A, 11/71, 6) Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, in keynote address said tools and techniques originating from space exploration had arrived just in time to aid ecologists in saving planet earth. “Many benefits are now being realized, but we can expect far greater returns as increasingly sophisticated devices go into service.” (Program; Birmingham Post-Herald, 11/17/71) Mariner scientists reported in news conference at JPL Nov. 19 that instruments had shown planet was flattened at poles and bulging at equator and had more irregularities in its gravitational field than moon had. Bulge was discovered in area called Tharsis, on equator, making planet’s diameter 39 km (24 mi) greater at equator than through poles. Infrared spectrometer had measured reflected radiations that suggested wide range of rock compositions on Mars surface, varying from high in silicon and oxygen to low. Spectrometer had also detected small amounts of water vapor at south pole, as had been observed on previous Mariner flights. On Nov. 23 Mariner 9’s infrared interferometer spectrometer (iris) detected pocket of warm air above south polar cap in same region as water vapor traces had been found earlier. Air pocket was about 240 K (—30°C). (Wilford, NYT, 11/20/71, 51; O’Toole, W Post, 11/20, 23, 24/71; Miles, LA Times, 11/24/71; jpl Hist Off)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 satellites were “successfully continuing the scientific exploration of Mars and the space near the planet in substantially different orbits,” Tass announced. To date, 153 radio communication sessions had been held with Mars 2 and 159, with Mars 3 fbis-Sov-71-241 )
Successful free-flight development test of parachute system for Viking Mars landers to be launched in 1975 was conducted by NASA at dot Joint Parachute Test Facility in El Centro, Calif. Test was to verify functioning of main decelerator parachute and its deployment mechanism and confirm structural adequacy of system design. Deployment mortar and parachute—16 m (53 ft) in diameter, packaged in instrumented drop vehicle 3 m (10 ft) long and 51 cm (20 in) in diameter—were dropped from NASA B-57 aircraft at altitude of 15 200 m (50 000 ft), (nasa Release 71-162; frc pio)
NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences had agreed to rapid exchange of findings on Mars from U.S. and U.S.S.R. probes nearing that planet, nasa announced. Recommendations of Joint Working Groups of U.S. and Soviet scientists who met in Moscow Aug. 2-6 to negotiate agreement on joint projects and exchanges in space research and applications had all been approved. Included was telegraphic exchange of findings of special interest by NASA’s Mariner 9 (launched May 30) and Soviet Mars 2 (launched May 19) and Mars 3 (launched May 28). All three spacecraft were scheduled to reach Mars orbit in November. nasa and Soviet Academy also had agreed on joint seminars to facilitate analysis of data; exploration of feasibility of transmitting magnetometer data from U.S.S.R. ground-based observing stations in real-time to U.S. satellite ats-f (scheduled for mid-1972 launch) and retransmitting data to ground with data from onboard magnetometer; and bilateral discussions on scientific results, objectives, and strategy of planetary exploration. Further agreements were to exchange information on photography from past and future missions and all lunar maps, to continue exchange of lunar samples, to conduct multipurpose aerospace and field experiments on environment, and to make joint efforts in remote sensing of ocean. Technical Note would be exchanged on temperature sounding from satellites to develop joint experiment over Western Europe in 1973 and 1974. Information on methods of microwave measurement and of data on cloud emissivity would also be exchanged. Efforts would be made to achieve similarity in U.S. and Soviet requirements for ground receiving equipment. nasa and Soviet Academy also had agreed to research topics for meteorological sounding rocket investigations by both nations, to exchange alerts of stratospheric warmings, to conduct rocket system intercomparison tests, and to present scientific results in regular seminars and symposia.

U.S.S.R.’s Mars 3, launched May 28, was continuing its flight toward Mars. At 9:00 pm Moscow time (1:00 pm est) spacecraft was 138.8-million-km (86.3-million-mi) from Mars, having traveled approximately 472 million km (293 million mi). (NYT, 12/1/71, 20; fbis-Sov-71-231-3, 12/1/71, LI)
kasa selected Douglas Aircraft Co., Grumman Aerospace Corp., and Lockheed-Georgia Co. for negotiations of three separate $ 1.5-million, six-month contracts for design phase of questol (quiet, experimental stol) program. After completion of design phase one contractor would be selected to fabricate two experimental transport aircraft for flight research program. (NASA Release 71-238) *	Description by Soviet professor of physics and mathematics M. Marov of Mars 2 scientific program to Soviet journalists was reported by Tass: “Registration of various radiations from Mars, ranging from ultraviolet light to radio waves, by sputniks from a comparatively short distance will give much more complete information about Mars. Certain findings which are still quite inadequate are readily available. It has been established that at least nine-tenths of the Martian atmosphere consists of carbon dioxide. Nitrogen is practically absent, while water vapors are very scant. The thin atmosphere of Mars is extremely heterogeneous. Its structure varies widely with seasons, the time of day and night. The structure of the surface in the areas explored is very heterogeneous too.” (fbis-Sov-71-233, 12/3/71, L3)
U.S.S.R. launched Mars 2 probe toward Mars from Baykonur at 9:23 pm local time (12:23 pm edt). At 10:59 pm Baykonur time (1:59 pm edt) spacecraft was injected into flight trajectory for Mars from “artificial earth satellite” in terrestrial orbit, according to Tass. Instruments were said to be working normally and flight was said to be close to calculated course. Primary objective of six-month, 470-million-km (292-million-mi) mission, Tass said, was to conduct complex research of Mars and its atmosphere and study characteristics of solar plasma, cosmic rays, and radiation along Mars route. Satellite was scheduled to reach Mars vicinity in November, when planet was 129 million km (80 million mi) from earth. Mars 2 was said to weigh 4650 kg (10 250 lbs)—almost five times weight of 1000-kg (2200-lb) Mariner-I scheduled for launch by nasa toward end of May. Size of Mars 2 had led U.S. space experts to predict that it might attempt Mars orbit. Mars 1, launched Nov. 1, 1962, had failed when radio contact was lost 106 million km (66 million mi) from earth. Zond 2, launched Nov. 30, 1964, had also ended in communication failure, (gsfc SSR, 5/31/71; SBD, 5/21/71, 112; Shabad, NYT, 5/20/71, 1; fbis-Sov-98-71, 5/20/71, LI; A&A, 1962; 1963; 1964)
The US.SJl.’s Mars 3 probe softlanded a capsule art the planet Mars. The capsule transmitted signals 20 seconds before falling silent. In the Toss news service photo the descent apparatus—shown here in descent position—carried a braking cane that also served as a heat shield for the capsule. The cone fell away as the main parachute, stored in the container immediately above the capsule, opened to slow the fall. (Photo courtesy of United Press International) cameras have been frustrated by a storm that has covered almost all of Mars with dust for more than two months. It’s almost impossible to imagine a global dust storm, and when one thinks of a global storm lasting for two months, it’s even harder to imagine life surviving such cataclysmic weather conditions. . . . now the dust has begun to settle on the planet, revealing striking features that man has never seen before. Nevertheless, the idea that there might be life among those features is one that seems to be a dying one.” (W Post, 12/2/71, A19)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 3 probe (launched May 29) reached vicinity of Mars and ejected capsule which softlanded on planet. U.S.S.R. did not announce landing until Dec. 7 and did not release details until Dec. 19. After separation, capsule bearing Soviet coat of arms entered Mars atmosphere and parachuted to softlanding in Mars southern hemisphere between Electris and Phaetonis in area 45° south latitude and 158° west longitude. Mars 3 continued flight into orbit with 1500-km (930-mi) periapsis and 11-day period. Tass said signals from landing capsule “were received and recorded on board . . . Mars 3 and later . . . transmitted to the earth on December 2-5. The videosignals received from the surface of Mars were brief and suddenly discontinued.” (fbis-Sov-71-236, 12/8/71, LI)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 had discovered presence of oxygen and atomic hydrogen in Mars’ upper atmosphere, Tass announced. Hydrogen corona was located at altitude of 10 000-20 000 km (6200-12 400 mi) above surface, and oxygen at 700-1000 km (435-620 mi). Spacecraft also measured temperature changes on Martian surface. Individual areas on diurnal side did not exceed 258 K (—15°C, or 5°F). On nocturnal side, temperature in some regions exceeded that of environment by 20-25 K (20-25°C, or 68-77°F).

NASA notified U.S.S.R. of Mariner 9 Mars orbit in telexed message to I. A. Zhulin, Soviet space expert, in Moscow. Message, from Dan Schneiderman, Mariner 9 Project Manager at JPL, said spacecraft had achieved desired orbit but ephemeris used in planning orbit required 60-km (37-mi) adjustment. Mars “appears brighter than expected by a factor of two. Surface features are almost entirely obscured, but the south polar cap can be seen because of its brightness. This is believed to be the result of a dust storm which covers the entire planet.” Infrared instruments on the two Mariner 9 cameras “appear to be seeing the [Martian] surface, but interpretation of their results is complicated by effects of the dust storm. Message invited Soviet request for additional orbit information and described Nov. 10 and 11 photos taken by Mariner 9 before Mars arrival. Photos had shown “four distinct dark features,” one “possibly Nix Olympica.” Nov. 12 photos had shown streaks 1000 km (620 mi) long originating at fourth spot. “Changes in appearance of these four dark areas over the coming weeks may provide unique information about the dust storm.” (nasa Release 71—229)
jpl announced selection of Motorola, Inc., Government Electronics Div. for negotiations on $2 179 000 contract with award fee to design, fabricate, and test flight-data subsystem for NASA Mariner Venus-Mercury spacecraft for 1973 mission. JPL also had selected Litton Industries Guidance and Control Systems Div. for negotiations on $10.4-million contract for development, fabrication, and testing of gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (to be carried on Viking lander) to analyze Mars surface, (jpl Releases 581, 582)
Thomas O’Toole described in Washington Post effects of Mariner 9 data on idea that life existed on Mars: “In the three weeks that it has spent in Martian orbit so far, Mariner 9 has found that the planet’s atmosphere is even thinner than it was thought to be—about 260 times as thin as Earth’s atmosphere. It also found Martian surface temperatures to be no higher than 80 degrees below zero. To date, Mariner 9’s
Dr. George M. Low, Acting nasa Administrator, presented nasa FY 1972 budget request to House Committee on Science and Astronautics: FY 1972 projects—including Apollo 15 and 16, two Mariner spacecraft, first erts satellite, and continuing work toward future flights of Apollo 17, Skylab, earth resources and ats satellites, and Viking probes —represented “the fulfillment of enterprises of the 1960’s, the tailing off to completion of work in progress for many years. By 1974 the number of nasa space launches per year will have declined from 26 in 1966 to eight. After the Skylab missions in 1973, we face at least 4 years in which there will be no United States manned space flight. “Five years ago there were over 390 000 people in industry employed on nasa work. By the end of fiscal year 1971 that figure will be about 108 000. The decline will continue for a few more months, but we expect it to start increasing by the middle of fiscal year 1972, with the end-of-the-year total being about equal to that at the beginning.” U.S. was “running a serious risk of losing too much of the aerospace capability that is an essential ingredient of our long term national strength and security.” There was every indication U.S. would lose leadership in space “unless we move forward now with our space programs for the 1970’s. In 1970 the Soviets launched 88 payloads into space compared to . . . 36 for the United States. Their r&d budget is continuing to increase. They have seldom missed a launch window in the exploration of Venus and Mars while we have many gaps in our planetary program. We would expect them to use automated vehicles and sample return spacecraft from the planets, while we have no such program. Finally the Soviets have a systematic continuing manned space flight program and have stated that they expect to fly a space station before we do.” U.S. should continue to compete with U.S.S.R. “because accomplishments in space represent a measure of the state of our technology; and in today’s world, the level of our technology is of first importance, strategically, economically, and politically.” Dr. Low believed U.S. could cooperate with U.S.S.R. “in the areas we have under discussion without prejudicing any of our vital national interests.” nasa was reexamining procurement policies and practices and “beginning a serious critical appraisal of the proper size, composition, and organization of NASA’s institutional base.” Position reduction of 1500 in FY 1972 budget was in anticipation that “reduction of this magnitude would be found possible without unduly impairing our ability to carry out the program. Our budget justifications show this reduction as a flat percentage cut—about 5.1%—in all of our major activities. The actual adjustments . . . will be refined as our study of the nasa institutional base proceeds.” nasa program was 1.4% of U.S. budget, contrasting with 53% for domestic programs related to human and physical resources, yet U.S. stood to gain “tremendous benefits now and in the future” from exploration and applications of space science and technology. And whole future “as a nation and as mankind” depended on space science. “For in order to survive in the changing environment on our planet Earth, we must understand the processes that govern our universe.” Dr. Wernher von Braun, Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, said purpose of nasa Meteorology Program was to “develop and demonstrate sensors and spacecraft for making those meteorological measurements that will enable a continued improvement in weather forecasting throughout the world with an ultimate view to a limited degree of weather modification and control of severe weather systems. Projections indicate that by about 1980 it should be possible to reach a global capability to acquire information throughout the atmosphere and to develop comprehensive weather models. Once developed, these models can be used to make 14-day weather forecasts and long-range climate estimates.” Ability to develop weather models would permit basic experimenting in weather control. Space shuttle was key nasa development believed essential in 1970s, Dr. von Braun said, presenting U.S. with its greatest technology challenge for space in this decade. “Preliminary analysis indicates that if the shuttle is used in lieu of current expendable systems, the transportation costs will be reduced by at least a factor of ten. . . . Only by an investment now will we be able to have operational an economical transportation system by the end of the 1970’s to support a vigorous and balanced space flight program.” (Transcript)
Baltimore Sun editorial commented on softlanding on Mars of instrumented capsule by Soviet Mars 3: “For the first time man has been able to reach Mars with implements that have proved capable both of surviving a landing and of working, for a time at least, after they have been landed. This of course is only one approach to the new studies of brother objects in space. The United States Mariner 9 may by photographic means add valuable pictorial knowledge to that which Mars 3 has reported by signal. And even if neither of these latest raids on the unknown returns as much information as men want, they have together shown that the means by which more and more can be learned are now in our hands, even if in only a primitive and imperfect state so far.” (B Sun, 12/8/71, A18)
Univ. of Toronto had announced discovery by astronomer Dr. Sidney Van Den Bergh of three galaxies composed of thousands of stars, Washington Post reported. (W Post, 11/12/71, A36) First photos were obscured by dust storm but before end of month Mariner 9 had shown that Mars bulged at equator, was “rougher gravitationally” than expected, and probably had wide variety of rock compositions; instruments had detected small amounts of water vapor at south pole and warmer air pockets above pole [see Nov. 16-23]. Spacecraft also made man’s first close photo of potato-shaped Martian moon Deimos [see Nov. 26—27] and photos of moon Phobos [see Nov. 29-30]. First Mariner photos from orbit were broadcast live by national TV network, but detail was limited by dust storms that had raged on surface since September. Dr. Robert H. Steinbacher, jpl project scientist, said “We’re hopeful that as the storm dies down we can get some good pictures of the dust settling to the surface. This is an unprecedented chance to watch changes in the Martian weather.” He said that if cameras worked properly pictures would be 1000 times better than any earthbound telescopes had taken. On Nov. 14 spacecraft transmitted three sequences of TV pictures. Of more than 60 photos returned, only seven revealed surface features. Dust storm continued and atmospheric experts could see no sign of abatement. Dust obscuring planet was apparently very fine sand which high winds pushed to height of as much as 16 km (10 mi) above surface. On fourth orbit spacecraft successfully completed orbit trim maneuver at 9:44 pm est Nov. 15. Maneuver changed orbital period of spacecraft to make it synchronous with Mars viewing period of Deep Space Station antenna at Goldstone, Calif. New orbital parameters were 1394-km (866.2-mi) periapsis altitude, 11-hr 57-min 12-sec period, and 64.34° inclination. Data from remote-sensing instruments confirmed earlier observations that carbon dioxide was major constituent of Martian atmosphere and also suggested possibility of “hot spots” on planet. Dr. Ellis D. Miner of JPL said sensor detected average temperature rise of 6.7 K (12°F) in area 24 km (15 mi) square below Mars equator. Temperature rise might indicate hole in cloud cover exposing mountain peak or plateau reflecting residual heat or evidence of internal source of heat on Mars, uv spectrometer data indicated dust storm was made up of fairly coarse-grained, sandlike particles, (nasa Proj Off; Wilford, NYT, ll/14r-16/71; O’Toole, W Post, ll/14r-15/71; W Star, 11/16/71, A4)
NASA sent message to Dr. I. A. Zhulin in Moscow via telex communication system established for exchange of information on Manner 9 and Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions to Mars. Message congratulated U.S.S.R. on success of Mars 2; requested Mars 2 coordinates, orbital parameters, doppler data, and data from uv spectrometer; and provided information on U.S. Mariner 9 photos of Mars and moons, doppler data, and uv spectrometer data, (nasa Release 71-240)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 probe (launched May 19) ejected capsule 1380 km (858 mi) above Mars on direct trajectory to planet’s surface. Capsule, carrying pennant bearing U.S.S.R. hammer-and-sickle coat of arms, became first man-made object to reach surface. After capsule ejection Mars 2 decelerated and entered Martian orbit with 25 000-km (15 500-mi) apogee, 1380-km (858-mi) perigee, 1080-min (18-hr) period, and 48.9° inclination. Mars 2 had traveled 470 million km (292 million mi) to reach Mars. During flight it had explored interplanetary space and three midcourse corrections had been conducted, June 17, Nov. 20, and automatically on Nov. 27. Spacecraft was reported operating normally in Martian orbit. U.S.S.R. did not indicate whether capsule softlanded or hard-landed or what mission was.
