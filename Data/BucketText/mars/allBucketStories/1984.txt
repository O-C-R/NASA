NASA reported on scientific data of the Viking Lander Monitor Mission (VLMM) in the areas of meteorology, radio science, and imaging. The Viking program had explored Mars, using two instrumented orbiters operating in conjunction with two instrumented landers on the planet’s surface. Two identical spacecraft, each consisting of a lander and orbiter, were launched in 1975 and began operating at Mars in 1976. A frugal VLMM was conducted from the end of the extended mission in 1980 until June 1983. Based on the data acquired in support of the mission objectives, NASA judged the VLMM successful. Analyses of the data from the mission would continue for some years, supported by the Mars Data Analysis Program of the Solar System Exploration Division.

At a ceremony today in Washington, D.C., NASA transferred ownership of Viking Lander 1, which was on the planet Mars, to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum. It was the first time a museum would own an object located on another planet. The transfer also included loan of the official Viking Lander plaque, which renamed the lander the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in memory of the Viking landing imaging team leader and NASA associate administrator for space science who had died in a climbing accident in the Himalayas in 1980. NASA retained reclaimant rights to the lander for scientific purposes. (NASA Release 84-58; NY Times, May 3/84, A-19)
