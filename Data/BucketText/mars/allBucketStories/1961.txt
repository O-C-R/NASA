In news conference, Dr. Albert R. Hibbs, Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Chief of Space Sciences, stated that it would be a “major accomplishment” if the United States were to overtake the Russians in the race to the Moon, a “less than 50-50 chance.” He pointed to the rumors that the Soviet Union had already attempted to launch a probe to Mars.
President Kennedy stated in his state of the Union address to Congress: “This administration intends to explore promptly all possible areas of cooperation with the Soviet Union and other nations ‘to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors.’ Specifically, I now invite all nations—including the Soviet Union—to join with us in developing a weather prediction program, in a new communication satellite program, and in preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus, probes which may some day unlock the deepest secrets of the universe.”
