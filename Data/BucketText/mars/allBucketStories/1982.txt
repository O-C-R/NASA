Charles (Pete) Conrad, who commanded Skylab’s first mission and was now a vice president for marketing at McDonnell Douglas, said that pieces of Skylab that crashed in 1979 over western Australia after five years in orbit would go on sale, with proceeds to NASA, for the support of Viking I, the Mars lander still sending messages from the surface of that planet. The Skylab pieces fitted into colorful posters were expected to raise from $150,000 to $500,000. Conrad had been a member of the Apollo 12 mission that landed on the Moon as well as commander of the Skylab mission in 1973. (W Post, Nov 12/82, A-10)
A robot craft, Venera 13, fifth from the Soviet Union to land on Venus, sent the first color pictures of that planet’s surface and scooped up a soil sample for the most detailed analysis to date of Venus chemistry, Tass reported. A module detached from Venera 13 plunged through Venus’s dense carbon dioxide atmosphere to an area called Phoebe, south of its equator. A Venera 14 identical lander was scheduled to arrive March 5 at an area east of the Phoebe site. Soviet mission planners had consulted scientists and radar maps from the U.S. Pioneer Venus project in deciding where to aim the Veneras; they promised to share Venera data at future international scientific conferences. U.S. scientists familiar with the Soviet plans said that the Veneras were equipped for “much more sophisticated” studies of Venus soil chemistry than previous probes; these were the first craft able to drill into the crust, extract a sample, and analyze it, as the Vikings had on Mars. Pioneer Venus 1 had been orbiting Venus since December 1978, mapping the planet by radar. Pioneer Venus 2 deployed five probes to sample the planet’s atmosphere, only one of them surviving to transmit an hour of data on surface temperatures. Soviet studies of Mars failed, but Venera 9 and Venera 10 in 1975 transmitted the first images from the Venus surface, and Venera 11 and Venera 12 in 1978 collected data on radioactive soil. After separation and landing, Venera 13 had survived to send surface data relayed by the mother ship for 127 minutes.

On the basis of data acquired in support of its mission objectives, NASA declared successful the Viking extended mission conducted from the end of its primary mission in 1976 until August 1980. Viking’s mission was to explore the planet Mars using two instrumented orbiters operating in conjunction with two instrumented landers on the surface. Identical spacecraft launched in 1975, each consisting of an orbiter and a lander, began operating at Mars in 1976. The design life of the spacecraft was 90 days following orbit insertion or landing on the Martian surface; however, the Viking flight team found “ingenious ways” to extend the operating lifespans and obtain the maximum possible science data. When the extended mission began November 15, 1976, Orbiter 2 operated until July 24, 1978 (another 20 months), when a small leak in its attitude-control system depleted its gas supply. Lander 2 operated on the planet’s surface for 41 months, until April 12, 1980; its transmitter was turned off when its batteries could no longer hold a charge. Orbiter 1 lasted even longer, a total of 45 months after orbital insertion, and completed is operations August 7, 1980, when its control gas was also exhausted. The end of Orbiter 1 operation was to be the official end of the Viking extended mission; however, Lander 1—designated the Mutch Memorial Station January 7, 1981—was still operating in a continuation automatic-mission mode and providing important science data. Extended-mission objectives were “to obtain seasonal variations, long-duration sampling for statistically important experiments, and to obtain data not possible during the primary mission due to time constraints or observational limitations.” Mission results were “far in excess of those expected.” The program now consisted of Lander l’s acquiring and storing imaging, meteorology, and engineering data in a seven-plus day cycle and transmitting to Earth on command. Data should continue until the end of 1994, when the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) could no longer power the transmitters.
