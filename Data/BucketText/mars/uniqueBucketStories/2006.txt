NASA announced that its Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) was likely no longer operational. The spacecraft had ceased communications with NASA on 2 November 2006, and NASA’s subsequent efforts to reestablish communications had failed. NASA did not officially terminate the spacecraft’s mission. NASA had launched MGS in November 1996 to create a map of Mars. After completing its primary mission in January 2001, MGS had remained in operation, and NASA had decided to extend the spacecraft’s mission. The MGS mission had eventually become the longest and most productive ever sent to Mars, producing nearly 240,000 images that revealed features of Mars never before seen, as well as the first strong evidence of the previous existence of water on the planet.(NASA, “NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor May Be at Mission’s End,” news release 06-357, 21 November 2006, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/nov/HQ_06357_MGS_update.html (accessed 7 July 2010); Thomas H. Maugh II, “Missing Mars Craft Appears To Be a Lost Cause,” Los Angeles Times, 22 November 2006.)
NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) began the primary science phase of its mission, a phase scheduled to continue until December 2008. NASA had designed MRO to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars, while orbiting the planet, and had launched the orbiter in August 2005. During the primary science phase, MRO would produce high-resolution surveys of 15 percent of Mars’s surface. NASA planned to use the images to identify particular areas for more detailed examination. NASA anticipated that data from MRO’s surveys would enable scientists to examine changes in the surface of Mars occurring over time, including the effects of water and wind.(NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, “NASA’s Newest Mars Orbiter Passes Communications Relay Test,” 17 November 2006, http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=1230 (accessed 16 August 2010); NASA, “Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Arrival” (press kit, March 2006), 8–18, http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/ files/mro/mro-arrival.pdf (accessed 16 August 2010).)
After a seven-month, 310-mile (498.9-kilometer) journey, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) completed the crucial step of entering orbit around Mars. To achieve initial capture by the planet’s gravity, the orbiter fired its main propulsion engines for 27 minutes, thereby reducing its speed by 3,540 kilometers per hour (2,200 miles per hour). This placed the US$720 million spacecraft in a highly elliptical orbit. The next phase of the orbiter’s mission would involve a seven-month “aerobraking” process. The spacecraft would dip into Mars’s atmosphere hundreds of times, using the friction of atmospheric drag to move from an approximately 35- hour orbit, extending almost 35,000 miles (56,000 kilometers) above the planet, to a 2-hour polar orbit that skims only 190 miles (300 kilometers) above Mars’s surface. A two-year phase of scientific study would follow the aerobraking phase. During those two years, the orbiter would use six instruments to study every level of Mars, from underground layers to the top of the atmosphere. The instruments would include the most powerful telescopic camera ever sent to another planet, an advanced mineral mapper to identify water-related areas, radar to probe beneath the surface for buried ice and water, and a weather camera that would monitor the planet daily. MRO Project Manager James Graf predicted, “this spacecraft will return more data than all previous Mars missions combined.”(NASA, “Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Arrival,” press kit, March 2006, http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/ mro/files/mro/mro-arrival.pdf (accessed 30 July 2010); Damian Carrington, “New Mars Probe Safely Enters Orbit,” New Scientist, 10 March 2006; Warren E. Leary, “U.S. Spacecraft Enters Orbit Around Mars,” New York Times, 11 March 2006.)
