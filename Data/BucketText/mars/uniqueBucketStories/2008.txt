NASA announced that officials had ceased operations on the Phoenix Mars Lander after Lander stopped communicating with mission engineers on 2 November 2008. The project team had originally scheduled Phoenix for three months of operations, launching Phoenix on 4 August 2007 and landing it on Mars on 25 May 2008. NASA had extended its mission twice until, with the seasonal decline in sunlight, Phoenix’s solar arrays could no longer charge its batteries. During its mission, the US$428 million Lander had taken more than 25,000 pictures of Mars and had observed the planet’s soil and weather, looking for indications that Mars might have had an environment suitable for microbes in the past. Phoenix had documented falling snow on Mars; had found calcium carbonate, perchlorates, and salts deposits; had observed alkaline soil; and had verified the presence of two distinct types of water ice. The University of Arizona had led the Phoenix mission, and NASA’s JPL had managed the project.(NASA, “Mars Phoenix Lander Finishes Successful Work on Red Planet,” news release 08-284, 10 November 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/nov/HQ_08-284_Phoenix_Finishes_ Mission.html (accessed 22 August 2011); Kenneth Chang, “NASA Loses Contact with Mars Lander and Ends Its Mission,” New York Times, 11 November.)
Researchers led by Mikki M. Osterloo of the University of Hawaii announced in the journal Science that their team had found evidence of salt deposits on the surface of Mars. The scientists explained that the existence of salt deposits would provide evidence that Mars had once had an abundant supply of near-surface water, which could have sustained life. NASA’s Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System, a camera capable of producing images in visible light and infrared wavelengths, had made the discovery. The images showed spectral features consistent with chloride minerals, located at approximately 200 sites in the southern hemisphere. The salt deposits ranged in size from 0.5 square miles (1.3 square kilometers) to 25 times that size, with a thickness ranging from 3 to 10 feet (0.9 to 3 meters). Scientists believed that the mineral sites, which were approximately 3.5 to 3.9 billion years old, had formed when groundwater seeped to the surface and evaporated, leaving behind salty deposits.(NASA, “NASA Mission Finds New Clues To Guide the Search for Life on Mars,” news release 08-084, 20 March 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/mar/HQ_08084_Mars_Deposits.html (accessed 13 January 2011); David Mosher, “Newly Found Martian Salt Deposits Suggest Ancient Life,” Space.com, 20 March 2008, http://www.space.com/5150-newly-martian-salt-deposits-suggest-ancient-life.html (accessed 13 January 2011); M.

A team of scientists led by Janice L. Bishop of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute announced in the journal Science that they had found geological evidence that water, and possibly microorganisms, had been present in Mars’s Mawrth Vallis region in the past. Using NASA’s MRO’s Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), the scientists had studied the layers of sediment comprising the 4 billion-year-old clay deposits of that region. The top layer of clay, which contained many aluminum deposits, had probably formed in a wet environment when other minerals were leached from the soil leaving large amounts of aluminum behind. Immediately below the top layer containing aluminum-rich clay was a layer of silica opal. Clay rich in reduced iron formed a still lower layer. A large body of water interacting with a lakebed of basaltic ash or rock probably formed the lowest layer, which is composed of iron and magnesium smectites. Bishop’s team noted that, on Earth, the actions of microorganisms frequently cause iron reduction in the soil. However, the team also stated that other forces could have been responsible, on Mars.(Andrea Thompson, “Clays Shed Light on History of Mars Water and Possibly Life,” Space.com, 7 August 2008, http://www.space.com/5709-clays-shed-light-history-mars-water-possibly-life.html (accessed 20 July 2011); see also Janice L.

A team of scientists reported in the journal Nature that they had gathered new evidence to support the theory that Mars’s Borealis Basin is a large impact crater. After NASA’s Viking spacecraft had captured the first clear images of the Martian surface in the 1970s, scientists had puzzled over the dichotomy of the planet: the roughly cratered southern highlands have an altitude 2.5 to 5 miles (4.02 to 8.05 kilometers) higher than the smooth plains of the northern lowlands. One theory that scientists had advanced to explain this dichotomy was that the impact of a foreign object had created the lowlands of the Borealis Basin. However, many in the scientific community had doubted this theory because the images from the 1970s suggested that the basin did not have the typical shape of an impact crater. In the article in Nature, NASA’s MRO and NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor teams reported that they had gathered new topographical and gravitational data, showing that the basin has an elliptical shape consistent with that of impact craters. Moreover, two other studies published in the same Nature issue had used computer models to demonstrate that a meteor might conceivably have created the Borealis Basin. Scientists estimated that an object 1,250 miles (2,011.68 kilometers) wide, traveling at a speed of approximately 20,000 miles (32,186.88 kilometers) per hour, could have formed the crater when it crashed into Mars. If this theory proved correct, the Borealis Basin would be the largest known impact crater in the solar system.(NASA, “NASA Spacecraft Reveal Largest Crater in Solar System,” news release 08-159, 25 June 2008, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jun/HQ_08159_Mars_crater.html (accessed 21 April 2011); Kenneth Chang, “Astronomers Explain Mars’s Lopsided Shape,” New York Times, 26 June 2008; see also Jeffrey C.)
A team of researchers announced in the journal Science that they had found on Mars soil deposits composed of more than 90 percent silica. NASA’s Spirit rover had found the deposits in the Columbia Hills in Mars’s Gusev Crater. Initially, scientists had used Spirit’s Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) and Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer to identify a pure silica deposit in the groove that Spirit’s broken front wheel had made as it dragged through the dirt. Subsequently, they had found other silica deposits nearby. On Earth, pure silica forms from the interaction of hot water and rock. Therefore, the scientists believed that these deposits might indicate that Mars had possessed hydrothermal vents in its ancient past. Because hydrothermal vents support microbial life on Earth, scientists believed that similar vents on Mars might also have hosted life.(Andrea Thompson, “Hydrothermal Vents on Mars Could Have Supported Life,” Space.com, 23 May 2008, http://www.space.com/5374-hydrothermal-vents-mars-supported-life.html (accessed 16 March 2001); see also S. W. Squyres et al., “Detection of Silica-Rich Deposits on Mars,” Science 320, no. 5879 (23 May 2008): 1063−1067.)
NASA announced that its Phoenix Mars Lander had verified the presence of water ice in the Martian soil. Phoenix, which landed on Mars on 25 May 2008, had collected a soil sample from a 2-inch-deep (5.08-centimeter-deep) trench. Phoenix Mars Lander had dug the trench in the Martian polar region. The spacecraft had experienced difficulty moving the soil into the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer (TEGA) for testing, because the freshly dug soil samples had been
