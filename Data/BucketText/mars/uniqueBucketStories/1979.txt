Pioneer 10 had become the first U.S. craft to fly beyond Mars, Today reported. An Associated Press (AP) story said Pioneer 10, now 2 billion miles from home, had crossed the orbit of Uranus July 11 on its way out of the solar system. Launched in March 1972, Pioneer 10 sent back the first close-up views of Jupiter 21 months later and continued to transmit “valuable data about unexplored space and the outer solar system,” said NASA spokesman Duke Reiber. A spokesman for TRW, which built both Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, said Pioneer 10 would cross Pluto’s orbit in 1987. (Today, July 13/79, 10A; NASA Release 79-84)
NASA reported that the Viking 2 lander cameras had photographed a new layer of frost on the Utopia Planitia site, creating “a scientific puzzle” for researchers. In September 1977, the lander recorded frost on the surface of Mars during its northern winter (one Mars year and almost two Earth years ago); scientists had explained the frost as the result of a major dust storm, during which atmospheric particles picked up moisture that wound up as frost on the surface. However, latest observations of Mars showed the atmosphere clearer than it had been since the Vikings arrived in 1976, so that the frost could not be explained as before.
