Countdown for launch of nasa’s Mariner-I spacecraft toward Mars orbit was interrupted by hold at 4:59 pm edt 72 min from launch. Hold was caused by difficulty in interpreting data from Centaur stage guidance package. Difficulty was not resolved by 6 pm and launch was postponed to next day. (NASA Proj Off)
Mars orbit of Mariner 9 was changed by 17-sec engine firing to compensate for effects of dust storm on mission objectives. Periapsis was raised from 1388 km (862 mi) to 1650 km (1025 mi) to expand area covered in mapping photos and to provide required overlapping of pictures. Mapping would be completed in three 20-day cycles with fourth cycle available to fill in open areas where photos did not overlap. Period was increased by 1 min 19 sec to place periapsis in middle of Goldstone viewing period for maximum data return, (nasa Release 71—252; Pasadena Star-News, 12/31/71)
Flight path of Mariner 9, en route to Mars, was reported sufficiently precise for orbital insertion without scheduled second midcourse correction. Next critical event for Mariner 9 would be Mars orbit insertion Nov. 13, when spacecraft would begin to collect atmospheric and surface data and map 70% of Martian surface during 90 days in orbit. At 9:00 am edt, after 142.4 days in flight, Mariner 9 was 88 847 850 km (55 207 500 mi) from earth. Spacecraft was traveling at 59 220 km per hr (36 800 mph) relative to earth and had traveled total distance of more than 349 452 100 km (217 139 500 mi) since May 30 launch. (nasa Proj Off)
Mariner 9 photographed Martian plateau from 6500-km (4000-mi) altitude. Photo, released by jpl Dec. 29, showed area 120 km (75 mi) square in Phoenicis Lacus region, covered with fault lines and resembling wrinkled elephant hide. Faults and scarcity of craters suggested region was volcanic and relatively young geologically. (AP, B Sun, 12/30/71, A5; Miles, LA Times, 12/30/71)
Mariner 9, en route to Mars, was 7 900 000 km (4 909 000 mi) from earth at 9:00 am edt after traveling 82 500 000 km (51 263 000 mi) and receiving over 500 commands since launch May 30. Spacecraft was expected to accomplish its basic 90-day scientific mission objectives, but was using more nitrogen gas than predicted for maintaining attitude stabilization. Current predictions indicated nitrogen gas supply would be depleted in early August 1972, nine months after spacecraft went into orbit around Mars. Increased rate of consumption was due to circuit design error in attitude-control-system electronics. (nasa Proj Off; nasa Release 71-120)
Findings on atmosphere of Mars from UV spectrometer observations made during NASA’s 1969 Mariner flyby missions were reported in Science by Univ. of Colorado scientists Dr. Charles A. Barth and Dr. Charles W. Hord: “Mars . . . reflects sunlight in the ultraviolet, but it is the atmosphere, not the surface, that is responsible for the reflected light. Even though there are atmospheric scatterers in addition to the molecular scatterers, it is possible to relate the intensity of the scattered radiation with the atmospheric pressure. The variation of the pressure over the planet reveals the topography to vary over 7 kilometers [4Yz miles] in height and to be correlated with visible features. The carbon dioxide polar cap, in addition to being a cold trap for volatile gases in the atmosphere, may also be a very efficient absorption trap for nonvolatiles. This last property may make the cap a repository for gases produced by geological or biological activity.” (Science, 7/16/71, 197-201)
Mariner 9 and Soviet Mars 2 and 3 race to Mars was “exciting race for knowledge and the fame of exploration, exemplifying the kind of peaceful competition the world needs,” Washington Evening Star editorial commented. “If Mariner 9 reveals half of what it was sent out to find, it will be worth much more than the $150 million it is costing.” (W Star, 11/24/71)
NASA held Mariner 9 press conference at JPL. Discussion centered on dust storm that had covered planet since mission began and on origin of Martian craters. Dr. Bradford A. Smith of New Mexico State Univ. said storm had begun 10 wks earlier, had reached peak of intensity in 5th wk, and was gradually but continuously clearing. Project scientists disagreed, however, how long dust would obscure Mars; predictions ranged from a few weeks to months. If storm continued throughout mission, primary objective might have to be changed. Dr. Smith explained prime objective “was to map 70 percent of the planet in high resolution. If the storm does not clear up immediately, it will not be possible to do that within the nominal mission. An alternative might be to focus on the phenomenon that we have on our hands; that is, the dust storm. And instead of studying it in bits and pieces and waiting for the planet to clear up ... to rearrange our sequences to make an all out study of this atmospheric phenomenon.” Failure to complete mapping as planned would not significantly affect Viking Mars landing mission because, with only slight degradation, Viking zone could be mapped in last half or last third of Mariner 9 mission. “Also Viking has the capability to keep its landers in orbit for as long as two months while it does the mapping . . . [and] the capability to do some photographic site selection even if there were no usable pictures returned from ’71.” Dr. Harold Masursky of U.S. Geological Survey described four high points on Mars, all with large summit craters, suggesting that they might be volcanic calderas. Great alignment of relatively young topographic highs with summit craters suggested that Mars was geochemically active—that in not too distant past there had been extensive volcanic activity. Similar features might be found at lower elevations; they would be of interest because they had been, and still might be, hot. Such volcanic sources had, according to most opinions, produced terrestrial atmosphere; that is, carbon dioxide and water had come from such volcanic vents. Dr. Masursky emphasized that volcanic theory was not agreed on; project scientists’ views ranged from “agreement, to skepticism, to outright disbelief.” Data on Mars moons Deimos and Phobos were described by Dr. James B. Pollack of ARC. Deimos was 12 by 13km (7% by 8% mi) and Phobos was 21 by 26 km (13 by 16 mi). Moons were “among the darkest objects in the solar system,” reflecting only about 5% of sunlight that fell on them. Moons’ darkness could be attributed to basalts or carbonaceous chondrites in soil. If scientists could determine reason for darkness, they would soon be able to determine whether moons were captured asteroids or remnants of material from which Mars was formed. (Transcript)

U.S.S.R.’s Mars 3, approaching Mars, had detected possible evidence of earth’s magnetic tail farther out in space than previously reported, Pravda article said. Both Mars 2 and Mars 3 had passed through area 19 million km (12 million mi) from earth, where they had detected magnetic field. When Mars 3 passed through area it recorded streams of charged particles whose velocities differed from those observed in solar wind. Soviet scientists speculated that particles of solar wind were mixed with those of earth’s magnetic tail. (NYT, 12/5/71, 9)
Washington Evening Star editorial commented on Administration’s New Technologies Opportunities Program [see Oct. 31]: Much was worthwhile, “especially the attempt to mount a genuine program of conversion from defense and space-related to socially useful technological emphasis.” But “purely economic objectives of the program are murkier, at least at present. Granted that this nation may be on its way, in a number of industrial fields, to losing the technological lead that for so long has been a mainstay of our economic strength. Does it follow that the answer, in high-technology fields like electronics and commercial aviation, is what one Presidential adviser has called ‘an unaccustomed set’ of supports and subsidies to industry?” Question contained “all the elements of explosive controversy, and the administration will be hard-pressed to make a convincing case.” (W Star, 12/6/71, A10) Scientist Steve Korn of TRW Inc. Viking biological instrument team described instruments being developed for $11-million experiments to be conducted by two Viking landers scheduled for 1976 Mars landing. Sophisticated units for four experiments to search for microscopic life on Mars would be among most complex systems ever flown aboard unmanned spacecraft. Experiments included heat release experiment to analyze Martian soil for photosynthetic life similar to plant life on earth; experiment that would add nutrient to solid sample and measure metabolic conversion; gas exchange experiment to monitor environment surrounding sample for changes in gaseous makeup that would indicate presence of living organisms; and light-scattering experiment to provide nutrient to soil sample and detect any increases in scattering attributable to growth of microorganisms. Also, three-legged probes would snap photos; study Martian atmosphere; return meteorological data, pressures, temperatures, wind, and humidity; report on Mars’ magnetic and physical properties; and check seismic events. Probes would be lowered by parachute and retrorocket after landers had obtained orbit in procedure designed to land them accurately in areas deemed most likely to be habitats for life.

Tass announced that French equipment on Mars 3 (launched May 28) for investigating solar radio emission in one-meter-waveband experiment was functioning successfully. French instrumentation was manufactured by French specialists under French-Soviet cooperative program. (fbis-Sov-71-228-3, 11/26/71, Ll)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 spacecraft were functioning normally en route to Mars, Tass announced. At 6:00 am Moscow time June 8 (11:00 pm edt June 7) Mars 2, launched May 19, had completed 14 communications sessions and was 4 897 000 km (3 042 900 mi) from earth. Mars 3, launched May 28, had completed 19 communications sessions and was 2 880 000 km (1789 000 mi) from earth. (Sov Rpt, 6/25/71, 7)
Production of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and glycolic acid in uv tests under simulated Martian conditions indicated organic material was probably being produced by sunlight on Mars’ surface, jpl scientists Dr. Norman H. Horowitz, Dr. Jerry S. Hubbard, and Dr. James P. Hardy reported in Proceedings of National Academy of Science of USA. Same organic compounds were believed to have been precursors to biological molecules on primitive earth. Dr. Horowitz said findings, obtained from irradiation of fine soil and powdered glass samples by high-pressure xenon lamp and low-pressure mercury lamp, provided “most favorable indication for a possible Martian biological evolution that we have had in the last five years.” There were “still many uncertainties, however, which won’t be resolved until we land on the planet.” (Proceedings of NAS, 3/71, 574-8)
New mission plan had been adopted for Mariner-I (Mariner 9) Mars probe scheduled for launch no earlier than May 29, NASA announced. New plan—which would provide high-quality data return for all of original experiments but less data than planned for original two-spacecraft mission—assigned 65° inclination, 12-hr period, and 1200-km (750-mi) periapsis (low point in orbit around Mars) to Mariner-I, with Nov. 14, 1971, arrival date. New inclination would yield map covering almost 70% of Mars and period would ensure two-tape-load-per-day data return. (NASA Release 71-94)
Detailed Tass description of Mars 2 and 3 missions with diagrams of spacecraft and landing procedures appeared in Soviet newspapers. Enroute to Mars, spacecraft had measured solar wind particle streams, measured parameters of interplanetary magnetic fields, determined electron concentrations in interplanetary medium, studied solar radio emissions with Soviet-French Stereo-1 experiment, and studied spacial structure, directivity, and mechanism of radiation processes. In Mars orbit spacecraft had investigated Mars solar wind flow and its interaction with Mars ionosphere, recorded spectrum of charged particles and variations in magnetic field, and measured refraction of radiowaves. Mars 3 descent package had transmitted pictures only briefly after landing on Mars surface Dec. 2, Tass said: “At the computed time, the transmission of video pictures was begun and continued for about 20 sec. During that period a small part of a panorama was transmitted in which no discernible details were detected because of [the lack of] contrast. Now, it is still difficult to say what caused the termination of the transmission. It is possible that it was associated with the local peculiarities in the landing area, which are completely unknown, or with the dust storm raging at the time. Apparently the dust storm acted as a ‘veil’ covering the surface details during the panoramic exposure. The sudden cessation of signals made it impossible to obtain information from the scientific equipment.” Orbiting vehicle carried infrared radiometer, two TV cameras, photometer, and instruments to measure CO2 and determine water vapor content, surface radio-brightness temperature, and atmospheric density.

Baltimore Sun editorial commented on quantity of new scientific data to be expected from U.S. Mariner 9 and U.S.S.R. Mars 2 and 3 probes of Mars—data “certain to be gathered later if not now.” Whatever was learned, “the store of mystery held by the skies and even their nearest objects will remain enormous. . . . The admiration for man’s persistence in pitting his intelligence, skill, courage and inventiveness against the solar system’s magnificent teases is equaled by the folly of supposing we shall ever read any but a few of their overpowering riddles.” (B Sun, 11/17/71)
Mariner 9, launched by NASA May 30, had covered 142 600 000 km (88 600 000 mi) in 167-day journey to Mars. Spacecraft was 15 300 000 km (9 500 000 mi) from earth and had received more than 600 commands, (nasa Release 71—136)
Hanna Reitsch, described by Washington Evening Star as “Nazi Germany’s famous daredevil woman test pilot and the only woman in German history ever to be given two Iron Crosses for her exploits,” told of her glider research during Star interview. “I am searching for the right currents over the Alps. I don’t have to worry about . . . borders in the air. ... As we enter space work more, we will realize how small mankind is and how necessary it is to come together in peace.” (Dean, W Star, 11/16/71, B7) nauts to Mars and return them safely to Earth in a total round-trip time of 60 days.” (A&A, 11/71, 6) Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning, in keynote address said tools and techniques originating from space exploration had arrived just in time to aid ecologists in saving planet earth. “Many benefits are now being realized, but we can expect far greater returns as increasingly sophisticated devices go into service.” (Program; Birmingham Post-Herald, 11/17/71) Mariner scientists reported in news conference at JPL Nov. 19 that instruments had shown planet was flattened at poles and bulging at equator and had more irregularities in its gravitational field than moon had. Bulge was discovered in area called Tharsis, on equator, making planet’s diameter 39 km (24 mi) greater at equator than through poles. Infrared spectrometer had measured reflected radiations that suggested wide range of rock compositions on Mars surface, varying from high in silicon and oxygen to low. Spectrometer had also detected small amounts of water vapor at south pole, as had been observed on previous Mariner flights. On Nov. 23 Mariner 9’s infrared interferometer spectrometer (iris) detected pocket of warm air above south polar cap in same region as water vapor traces had been found earlier. Air pocket was about 240 K (—30°C). (Wilford, NYT, 11/20/71, 51; O’Toole, W Post, 11/20, 23, 24/71; Miles, LA Times, 11/24/71; jpl Hist Off)
Successful free-flight development test of parachute system for Viking Mars landers to be launched in 1975 was conducted by NASA at dot Joint Parachute Test Facility in El Centro, Calif. Test was to verify functioning of main decelerator parachute and its deployment mechanism and confirm structural adequacy of system design. Deployment mortar and parachute—16 m (53 ft) in diameter, packaged in instrumented drop vehicle 3 m (10 ft) long and 51 cm (20 in) in diameter—were dropped from NASA B-57 aircraft at altitude of 15 200 m (50 000 ft), (nasa Release 71-162; frc pio)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 3, launched May 28, was continuing its flight toward Mars. At 9:00 pm Moscow time (1:00 pm est) spacecraft was 138.8-million-km (86.3-million-mi) from Mars, having traveled approximately 472 million km (293 million mi). (NYT, 12/1/71, 20; fbis-Sov-71-231-3, 12/1/71, LI)
The US.SJl.’s Mars 3 probe softlanded a capsule art the planet Mars. The capsule transmitted signals 20 seconds before falling silent. In the Toss news service photo the descent apparatus—shown here in descent position—carried a braking cane that also served as a heat shield for the capsule. The cone fell away as the main parachute, stored in the container immediately above the capsule, opened to slow the fall. (Photo courtesy of United Press International) cameras have been frustrated by a storm that has covered almost all of Mars with dust for more than two months. It’s almost impossible to imagine a global dust storm, and when one thinks of a global storm lasting for two months, it’s even harder to imagine life surviving such cataclysmic weather conditions. . . . now the dust has begun to settle on the planet, revealing striking features that man has never seen before. Nevertheless, the idea that there might be life among those features is one that seems to be a dying one.” (W Post, 12/2/71, A19)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 3 probe (launched May 29) reached vicinity of Mars and ejected capsule which softlanded on planet. U.S.S.R. did not announce landing until Dec. 7 and did not release details until Dec. 19. After separation, capsule bearing Soviet coat of arms entered Mars atmosphere and parachuted to softlanding in Mars southern hemisphere between Electris and Phaetonis in area 45° south latitude and 158° west longitude. Mars 3 continued flight into orbit with 1500-km (930-mi) periapsis and 11-day period. Tass said signals from landing capsule “were received and recorded on board . . . Mars 3 and later . . . transmitted to the earth on December 2-5. The videosignals received from the surface of Mars were brief and suddenly discontinued.” (fbis-Sov-71-236, 12/8/71, LI)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 had discovered presence of oxygen and atomic hydrogen in Mars’ upper atmosphere, Tass announced. Hydrogen corona was located at altitude of 10 000-20 000 km (6200-12 400 mi) above surface, and oxygen at 700-1000 km (435-620 mi). Spacecraft also measured temperature changes on Martian surface. Individual areas on diurnal side did not exceed 258 K (—15°C, or 5°F). On nocturnal side, temperature in some regions exceeded that of environment by 20-25 K (20-25°C, or 68-77°F).

Thomas O’Toole described in Washington Post effects of Mariner 9 data on idea that life existed on Mars: “In the three weeks that it has spent in Martian orbit so far, Mariner 9 has found that the planet’s atmosphere is even thinner than it was thought to be—about 260 times as thin as Earth’s atmosphere. It also found Martian surface temperatures to be no higher than 80 degrees below zero. To date, Mariner 9’s
Baltimore Sun editorial commented on softlanding on Mars of instrumented capsule by Soviet Mars 3: “For the first time man has been able to reach Mars with implements that have proved capable both of surviving a landing and of working, for a time at least, after they have been landed. This of course is only one approach to the new studies of brother objects in space. The United States Mariner 9 may by photographic means add valuable pictorial knowledge to that which Mars 3 has reported by signal. And even if neither of these latest raids on the unknown returns as much information as men want, they have together shown that the means by which more and more can be learned are now in our hands, even if in only a primitive and imperfect state so far.” (B Sun, 12/8/71, A18)

U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 probe (launched May 19) ejected capsule 1380 km (858 mi) above Mars on direct trajectory to planet’s surface. Capsule, carrying pennant bearing U.S.S.R. hammer-and-sickle coat of arms, became first man-made object to reach surface. After capsule ejection Mars 2 decelerated and entered Martian orbit with 25 000-km (15 500-mi) apogee, 1380-km (858-mi) perigee, 1080-min (18-hr) period, and 48.9° inclination. Mars 2 had traveled 470 million km (292 million mi) to reach Mars. During flight it had explored interplanetary space and three midcourse corrections had been conducted, June 17, Nov. 20, and automatically on Nov. 27. Spacecraft was reported operating normally in Martian orbit. U.S.S.R. did not indicate whether capsule softlanded or hard-landed or what mission was.
