A robot craft, Venera 13, fifth from the Soviet Union to land on Venus, sent the first color pictures of that planet’s surface and scooped up a soil sample for the most detailed analysis to date of Venus chemistry, Tass reported. A module detached from Venera 13 plunged through Venus’s dense carbon dioxide atmosphere to an area called Phoebe, south of its equator. A Venera 14 identical lander was scheduled to arrive March 5 at an area east of the Phoebe site. Soviet mission planners had consulted scientists and radar maps from the U.S. Pioneer Venus project in deciding where to aim the Veneras; they promised to share Venera data at future international scientific conferences. U.S. scientists familiar with the Soviet plans said that the Veneras were equipped for “much more sophisticated” studies of Venus soil chemistry than previous probes; these were the first craft able to drill into the crust, extract a sample, and analyze it, as the Vikings had on Mars. Pioneer Venus 1 had been orbiting Venus since December 1978, mapping the planet by radar. Pioneer Venus 2 deployed five probes to sample the planet’s atmosphere, only one of them surviving to transmit an hour of data on surface temperatures. Soviet studies of Mars failed, but Venera 9 and Venera 10 in 1975 transmitted the first images from the Venus surface, and Venera 11 and Venera 12 in 1978 collected data on radioactive soil. After separation and landing, Venera 13 had survived to send surface data relayed by the mother ship for 127 minutes.
