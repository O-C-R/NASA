New York Times editorial commented on first global map of Mars produced by U.S. Geological Survey from Mariner 9 photos [see Nov. 27] : “Ever since telescopes were invented people have wondered to what extent Mars resembles Earth. Now, for the first time, the existence of a reasonably comprehensive picture of Mars provides a basis for comparison.” Despite differences from earth, “increased familiarity with the forces that have shaped its surface is bound to give man a more cosmopolitan view of how planets evolve—a view that should provide us with better understanding of the planet we call home.” (NYT, 11/29/72) November 30:	Six-day countdown for Apollo 17 began at 8:30 am EST at Kennedy Space Center. Spacecraft was scheduled for launch at 9:53 pm EST Dec. 6 (ksc Hist Off; AP, W Post, 12/1/72, A22)
NASA’s Mariner 9 Mars probe (launched May 30, 1971) completed photo-mapping of entire Mars surface with acquisition of final elements needed in playback of 30 pictures, bringing total photo count to more than 7000. Spacecraft—in Mars orbit since Nov. 13, 1971— would make 500th revolution around Mars July 20. During next three months Mariner 9 would provide precision tracking data to test relativity theory that electromagnetic radiation—spacecraft’s radio signal— passing close to sun would be slowed by sun’s gravitational field. Additional pictures would be taken once in August, once in September, and twice in October and stored for playback in late October. Lifetime was dependent upon supply of attitude-control gas.

Results of U.S.S.R. research of Mars as released by Soviet press were summarized by Interavia. Initial analysis of data collected by Mars 2 and 3 (launched May 19 and May 28, 1971) spacecraft during interplanetary flight had indicated large variations in composition of interplanetary plasma ions at 20 million km (12.5 million mi) from earth. Data had also revealed new information on distribution of solar plasma around solar system and its relationship with interplanetary and terrestrial magnetic fields. No magnetic field had been detected near Mars, indicating possible lack of liquid core. Orbits of spacecraft had been selected to cover areas of Martian surface difficult to investigate from earth-central latitudes of southern hemisphere to 65° south, equatorial zone, and northern hemisphere to 29° north. During Martian orbit infrared radiometer data had shown certain areas of surface to be definitely warmer than immediate surroundings, indicating possible volcanic activity. Mars 2 and 3 had found steam content in Martian atmosphere to be 2000 times less than that existing in terrestrial atmosphere. At times precipitated water could be 50 micrometers; at others, less than 10. Since photos taken by NASA’s Mariner 9 revealed impressive valleys which could have been formed by erosion, Soviet scientists had theorized that higher temperatures and pressures, sufficient to produce water in liquid form, existed on Mars in previous era. Very sharp differences in planet’s brightness, never before observed from earth, were observed by visible range photometer. Data were collected from measurement of radio-wave reflection. After landing, scientific results from Mars 2 and 3 had been meager. Mars 2 had hardlanded a capsule on Mars Nov. 27, 1971. Photos and measurements by Mars 3 (which softlanded a capsule Dec. 2, 1971) had indicated a dust cloud 6 to 8 km (4 to 5 mi) thick covering landing area, leading to speculation that either dust storms had raged over area and caused capsule to land incorrectly or capsule had sunk into dust layer. Soviet Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov had said U.S.S.R. planned to use 1973 launch windows if program of Martian exploration continued as planned. (Interavia, 10/72, 1139—41; gsfc SSR, 1/31/73)
nasa’s Pioneer 10 Jupiter probe (launched March 2) entered Asteroid Belt, beginning first reconnaissance of huge region of dust and rocks that circled sun between orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Doughnut-shaped belt was about 3 billion km (1.8 billion mi) around, 280 million km (175 million mi) wide, and 80 million km (50 million mi) thick. Asteroids in belt ranged in size from dust particles to rock chunks as large as Alaska. Passage of Pioneer 10 through belt would permit first measurements of asteroids too small to be seen with earth-based telescopes and of amounts and kinds of asteroidal material. During seven-month passage through belt, spacecraft was expected to pass within 8.9 million km (5.5 million mi) of asteroid Palomar-Layden Aug. 2 and asteroid Nike Dec. 2. Pioneer 10 carried three experiments for measurements in Asteroid Belt—asteroid-meteoroid detector, gas-cell-array meteoroid detector, and imaging photopolarim-eter.

Cameras on board NASA’s Mariner 9 Mars probe (launched May 30, 1971) were turned off to check out malfunction in onboard computer. (nasa Release 72-67)
Pravda article by scientists from Soviet Academy of Sciences Institute of Space Studies described preliminary results from U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 probes. Spacecraft (launched May 19 and May 28, 1971) had measured atmospheric humidity and surface temperature, photometered atmosphere and surface, and photographed surface. Temperature along route from 58° south latitude, 330° longitude to 30° north latitude, 190° longitude had been determined. Highest temperature—recorded near mid-day region—was 253 K (—20°C; —4°F). On night side of planet temperature dropped to 183 K (—90°C; —130°F). Dust storm that had covered Mars since Mars 2 reached planet Nov. 27, 1971, was subsiding. “Photometric recordings obtained by means of the red filtre show dark areas corresponding to the Martian ‘seas’ that were previously absolutely undistinguishable. But the recordings made with the ultraviolet filter again showed bright clouds.” Onboard instruments to record emissions in three spectral bands containing lines of hydrogen, oxygen, and argon atoms showed that hydrogen emissions stretched to more than 3400-km (2100-mi) altitude and oxygen atoms concentrated near surface up to 600-800 km (370-500 mi).

Science agreements signed during U.S.-U.S.S.R. summit meetings May 22-26 were praised in Science article: “Taken together, they represent not only a significant expansion of programs already in existence, but forays into areas hitherto unexplored.” Agreements were designed to “insulate cooperative scientific endeavors from the stresses of international politics by putting authority into the hands of appropriate government agencies rather than the foreign ministries.” In space agreement, “nasa is operating on the assumption that the joint docking is only the first in a series of increasingly ambitious mutual experiments—serving both the causes of economy and international understanding—which could conceivably lead to something as grandiose as a joint landing on Mars 20 years hence.” (Holden, Science, 6/9/72, 1106-8)
Soviet scientists V. Moroz and L. Ksanfomaliti described in Izvestia findings on Mars atmosphere from Mars 2 and 3 spacecraft. Difference in contrast on two wavelengths between continents and seas during dust storm and change in contrast in same field had permitted evaluation of dust particle size and cloud thickness. Average radius of particles over Iapigya region Dec. 15, 1971, was estimated to be less than one micrometer and density of particles to be 100 million per sq cm (645 million per sq in). “If clouds of such density uniformly envelop the entire planet, its atmosphere must have contained several thousand million tons of dust.” Estimates suggested that particles have mostly silicate composition, “which agrees with the infra-red spectra obtained by Mariner 9. Particles of such a tiny size . . . fall very slowly—for about a month even in the absence of supporting vertical currents in the atmosphere. Hence the conclusion that no prolonged storm in the true sense of the word, i.e. constant winds in the period of investigation, occurred.” Unlike Venus, where cloud layer and atmosphere were more pervious and created “hothouse effect,” surface of Mars “gets cool rather than heated, giving rise to what may be described as an ‘anti-hothouse effect.’ When the storm ended, the temperature rose.” Water vapor content of atmosphere was low during and after the dust storm (Tass, fbis-Sov, 3/22/72, LI)
NASA’s Mariner 9 Mars probe—orbiting Mars since Nov. 13, 1971—had resumed its scientific examination of Mars following engineering analysis of onboard computer, NASA announced. Cameras had been turned off March 17 while trouble-shooting procedures were conducted. Cause of problem had not been determined, but systems were working properly and problem had not recurred. Mariner 9 was 288 million km (179 million mi) from earth and had returned 7000 pictures of Mars and mapped 85% of Mars since launch May 30, 1971. Last pictures to be taken by Mariner 9 until first week in June had been recorded March 22 and 23 and science instruments would be turned off March 30. From April 2 to June 4 Mariner 9 would pass through Mars shadow once during each orbit for periods of up to 100 sec, during which spacecraft would operate on battery power. Limited science operations would resume after June 4, with spacecraft recording data and taking pictures about once a week until mission ended in November. Primary objectives of mission had been completed Feb. 11. (NASA Release 72-67)
Photographic equipment carried by U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 spacecraft in Mars orbit were described by Tass: “Automatic devices take pictures on the film which is automatically processed after photographing and then, on command from earth, the pictures are sent by television channels to the flight control centre.” Each spacecraft carried two “photo-television devices with wide-angle and long-focus objectives. ... all units and elements are placed together in one rigid body with the objective fixed outside and in the wide-angle camera—together with the objective and a device for changing colour filters.” Pictures were taken synchronously and transmitted with “an optico-mechanical television device.” (fbis—Sov, 3/8/72, LI)
Tass reported completion of U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 missions. Spacecraft, launched May 19 and'May 28, 1971, had reached Mars in November and December 1971 and had transmitted data on planet and atmosphere. Mars 3 instrumented capsule had landed on Mars and transmitted data from surface for 20 sec. Preliminary findings were: temperature ranged from 163 K (— 166°F) to 286 K (55°F); soil had low conductivity, with Martian seas warmer than continents; surface-level atmospheric pressure was 50-60 newtons per sq m (5.5-6 millibars), 200 times less than earth’s; carbon dioxide atmosphere broke up into carbonic oxide molecule and oxygen atom at 100-km (62-mi) altitude; atmosphere was 10 times less dense than earth’s and was closer to surface; and magnetic field charges exceeded interplanetary background level 8 times.

NASA released three photos of Mars taken by Mariner 9 Aug. 7. Pictures showeid that Mars north polar icecap was shrinking and showed sedimentary systems during late spring. Fractured terrains, partially flooded by volcanic extrusions, were visible in center of planet. (LA Her-Exam, 9/7/72)
First photos of Mars taken by U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 spacecraft were shown on Moscow TV. One photo showed equatorial zone with sun at low angle throwing long shadows over mountainous area. Second photo showed sharply defined, ring-shaped formation against light-colored background. Origin of formation, visible through dust clouds, was not established. Third photo showed craters of Syrtis Major. (NYT, 1/23/72)
Mission officials for Viking Mars mission were concerned about tenuous values of dielectric constant (measure of electrical charge a substance could withstand at a given electrical field strength) estimated from radar observations of Mars surface, Aviation Week & Space Technology reported. Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigators had found strong signal in 2-5 dielectric-constant range and weaker signal above that. Values suggested Mars had either hard bedrock surface impenetrable by spacecraft sampling equipment or deep dust surface that could not support landing vehicle. (Av Wk, 9/11/72, 11)
Institute of High Energy Physics at Serpukhov, near Moscow, inaugurated experimental complex which could extract proton cluster with maximum energy from 70-bev proton accelerator in millionth fractions of a second. (Tass, fbis-Sov, 6/9/72, LI) June 8-9:	NASA’s Mariner 9 spacecraft—orbiting Mars since Nov. 13, 1971—began photographing Mars after two-month rest period. Clear photos of Mars south and north poles—not clearly visible with earth-based telescopes and obscured from spacecraft by clouds in winter and spring—were taken June 8 and stored before transmission June 9 to Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Goldstone Tracking Station. Pictures were taken during 418th revolution in orbit with 16 900-km (10 500mi) apogee and 1650-km (1000-mi) perigee. Mariner 9 would take about 500 pictures during next nine weeks. It had taken 6876 photos covering 85% of planet between Nov. 13, 1971, and April 2, 1972, before it entered occultation period. (NASA Release 72-123)
Space researchers should look for insect life on Jupiter and for seeds and pollen on Saturn, Russian-born cosmologist Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky said during lecture sponsored by Ames Research Center’s Biotechnology and Planetary Biology Divs. at arc. He hypothesized that Venus and Mars had been in different orbits and had passed close enough to earth in centuries before Christ to cause cataclysms described in Old Testament. Dr. Velikovsky also suggested that several magnetic shells within solar system could return echoes and urged that spacecraft be sent to investigate them, (arc Astrogram, 8/3/72, 1; Mead, San Jose, Calif, Mercury, 8/15/72)
U.S.S.R.’s Mars 2 (launched May 19, 1971) had completed 111 revolutions of Mars and Mars 3 (launched May 28, 1971) had completed 6 revolutions, Tass announced. Radio contact with spacecraft remained stable and onboard instruments were continuing to function satisfactorily. (fbis—Sov, 2/22/72, L2)
U.S. planned to commemorate 200th anniversary of Nation’s birth by attempting to land unmanned spacecraft on planet Mars July 4, 1976, according to NASA spokesman quoted in Washington Post. Attempt would be made by Viking spacecraft scheduled to enter Mars orbit about July 1, 1976. (W Post, 4/6/72, A2)
NASA’s Pioneer 10 spacecraft, en route to Jupiter, crossed orbit of Mars and entered space never before visited by spacecraft. Pioneer 10 had safely crossed region of “Great Galactic Ghoul” 209 million km (130 million mi) from sun where two Mars-bound spacecraft had been lost and third had stopped transmitting for seven hours, apparently because of impact of high-velocity meteoroids. Since launch March 2 Pioneer 10 had traveled 249 million km (155 million mi) on its 998-million-km (620-million-mi) flight path to Jupiter and was 75 million km (47 million mi) straight-line distance from earth. It would enter Asteroid Belt in early July, reach Jupiter in December 1973, and cross orbit of Pluto in about 15 yrs. (NASA Release 72-111)
NASA’s Mariner 9 Mars probe (launched May 30, 1971) photographed vast Mars chasm with branching canyons resembling network of dry river beds. Describing photo, which was released to press Jan. 19, Harold Masursky, of U.S. Geological Survey, said in interview that chasm probably had been caused by “faulting of the crust,” a cracking and sliding process associated with earthquakes. Masursky believed line of small craters running parallel to canyon had probably been caused by venting volcanic gases and ash. Wind erosion and landslides had probably altered canyon, but landscape in photo appeared to be geologically young. (Wilford, NYT, 1/20/72, 25)
Low-altitude qualification test of Viking parachute—decelerator system to slow Viking spacecraft for softlanding on Mars 1976—was conducted by NASA at Dept, of Defense Joint Parachute Test Facility in El Centro, Calif. Parachute, 16-m (53-ft) in diameter and deployed by mortar, was dropped from B-57 aircraft. It opened on schedule, but dropped payload. Test was first of two low-altitude tests planned for 1972 and followed series of six development tests. High-altitude tests with balloon-launched parachute would be conducted during summer. Investigation was under way to determine cause of failure, (frc Release 6-72; W News, 4/28/72, 45)
U.S.S.R. hoped to land robot life-detection laboratory on Mars within few years, according to Leninskoye Znamya (Lenin’s Banner) newspaper article by Soviet space experts. Automatic Microbiological Laboratory would scoop up sample of Martian soil and examine it for microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts, and fungi that might be able to survive in thin Martian atmosphere. Laboratory would also draw Martian air through filter to trap and analyze microorganisms and would detect emission of heat and carbon dioxide. (Wilford, NYT, 3/27/72, 7; upi, W News, 3/13/72, 5)
Mariner Mars ’71 extended mission of 259 days beyond primary mission was adjudged success. Objectives of extended mission of Mariner 9 (launched by NASA May 30, 1971, and inserted in Mars orbit No. 13, 1971) had been to map 70% of planet with 1-km (0.6-mi) visual resolution and to study dynamic characteristics of Mars at reduced data-acquisition rate. During extended mission Mariner 9 had mapped 100% of planet and had observed large areas with infrared and ultraviolet instruments. S-band occultations and celestial mechanics measurements had proved Mars to be geologically and meteorologically active. (nasa proj off)
NASA’s Mariner 9 completed 146th day in Mars orbit. Since launch May 30, 1971, Mariner 9 had responded to 37 764 commands and had taken 6876 pictures. Spacecraft was undergoing solar occultation (passing into shadow of Mars) and would resume acquisition of data in early June when occultation ceased. Spacecraft resources were being budgeted to keep Mariner 9 active through superior conjunction of Mars and sun in September when spacecraft signals would be deflected by solar gravity. Analysis of deflection could provide accurate check on theory of relativity. (NASA proj off)
Experiments at U.S.S.R.’s Radio Physics Institute had suggested that upper Mars mantle was hard and porous like earth dendrites, Tass reported. Report on study had said small, isolated dust regions were source of Mars dust storms and there was no uninterrupted dust mantle. Dust over Martian surface was no more than 1 mm (0.04 in) thick. White polar caps were reported to be hard-frozen carbon dioxide. (fbis-Sov, 7/31/72, LI)
