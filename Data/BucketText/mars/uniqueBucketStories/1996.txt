NASA commemorated the 20th anniversary of Viking 1’s landing on Mars, the first time that a spacecraft had successfully descended to the surface of the planet. NASA marked the occasion with an address from Administrator Daniel S. Goldin and the celebration of Mars Day at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum. Viking 1 had searched for life on Mars, but at the end of its quest, scientists had found no evidence of life on Mars. As it celebrated its accomplishments, NASA continued its efforts to learn more about Mars throughout its 20th anniversary year, with the development of Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Pathfinder.(NASA, “Activities Planned To Commemorate 20th Anniversary of First Mars Landing,” news release 96-141, 15 July 1996.)
