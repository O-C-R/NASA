A panel of experts convened by the National Academy of Sciences opined against a U.S./U.S.S.R. joint mission to Mars. The reason they cited was the lack of any experience in cooperation between the two and instead suggested a "graceful path of coordinated but independent explorations." (NY Times, Apr
The Los Alamos National Laboratory urged NASA and the National Space Council to fund a multibillion dollar nuclear propulsion project that the group believed would reduce the Mars journey by half of the expected time. The proposed system would draw on a 1970s technology, Rover and Nerva programs, that circulated liquid hydrogen through a solid reactor core, thereby heating the hydrogen and creating thrust. The reactor engine could operate only in a vacuum, so testing it on Earth would prove difficult. The program, reported Space News, would likely receive substantial money. (Sp News, Feb 1925/90)
A letter from Lennard A. Fisk to Jacques Breton of the French space agency, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales, revealed NASA's defunct plans for a U.S.French experiment that was to fly aboard a 1994 Soviet mission to measure the mineral content of Mars. The constraints recently imposed on the two countries was the reason given for cancellation of the project. W Post, Jun 18/90)
