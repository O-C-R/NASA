Communications with NASA’s Mariner IV Mars probe, launched Nov. 28, 1964, were terminated because of greatly reduced telemetry availability. Spacecraft had responded to series of commands Oct. 25-27 and had continued operating satisfactorily until it exhausted its gas supply in the attitude control system Dec. 7 and began to pitch, roll, and yaw. On Dec. 10 and 11 Mariner IV recorded 83 micrometeoroid hits which apparently induced severe perturbations in pitch and yaw causing degraded signal strength. During its 3.06-yr lifetime, Mariner IV had traveled more than 1.5 billion mi in heliocentric orbit, taken world’s first closeup photos of Mars from 5,500-mi altitude, and returned excellent data, (nasa Proj Off; AP, B Sun, 12/23/67; W Post, 12/23/67, A5)	_

oar’s afcrl would launch four 812-ft-long balloon systems from Walker afb in summer 1967 to complete series of five launches conducted by nasa to investigate possible parachute landing systems for Voyager program [see May 9], oar Commander m/g Ernest A. Pinson announced. Scheduled for June 27, July 20, Aug. 9 and 24, flights would evaluate performance of different types of parachutes at pressures and velocities equivalent to a descent through the Martian atmosphere. Each balloon would carry, for release at high altitude, a simulated Voyager capsule and a parachute designed to softland the capsule on Mars. Five cameras—two on the capsule and three on the parachute—would be used to evaluate each test. First flight in the series was conducted Aug. 30, 1966.	(oar Release 67-17; AP, NYT, 6/8/67, 3)
JPL announced development of double vacuum chamber, designed by jpl’s James B. Stephens, to simulate extreme effects of interplanetary space on spacecraft. Called Molsink (molecular sink of outer space), chamber was expected to determine what happened to paint, components, and even microorganisms on spacecraft. The eight-foot-dia chamber would be capable of capturing 99.97% of all condensable molecules emanating from test item by freezing the molecules to the walls at — 400° F with super-cold helium gas. Conventional vacuum chambers had not been able to pump, or capture, more than half of gas molecules flying off test item. Space scientists believed Molsink chamber would provide reliable tool to measure and counteract problem of spacecraft out-gassing. In testing, long periods would simulate actual flight time of spacecraft to planets—four months to Venus, seven months to Mars, for example. The chamber was expected to be fully operational early in 1968, when testing would be stepped up for nasa’s Mariner Mars 1969 exploration program. ( jpl Release 459) Local sunset for second lunar day occurred on Oct. 23. Spacecraft operating time from turn-on command until second sunset was 232 hrs. Total of 1,043 TV pictures were obtained. By sunset Surveyor V had been configured for hibernating through second lunar night. Estimates were that engineering interrogations and compartment heating would be discontinued Oct. 31.

Mariner IV, launched Nov. 28, 1964, survived apparent micrometeoroid shower. Spacecraft’s cosmic dust detector registered 17 hits within 15 min, while Mariner IV traveled between orbits of earth and Mars. Spacecraft was 29.6 million miles from earth and had traveled about 1.4 billion miles in its 1,020 days of flight. Micrometeoroid shower had caused temporary change in spacecraft’s attitude but no loss of power. Scientists concluded, from one-degree temperature drop inside spacecraft, that only the thermal shield was damaged. Within about a week, spacecraft was operating without any apparent effect from incident. Since photographing Mars in July 1965, Mariner IV had been used for engineering experiments and acquisition of scientific data. (O’Toole, W Post, 9/16/67, A7; NASA Proj Off)

A 2,000-mph usaf SR—71 reconnaissance aircraft on routine training flight from Beale afb, Calif., crashed near Lovelock, Nev. Its two crew members ejected safely. Aircraft, built for usaf by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. as successor to the TJ—2, was third SR-71 to crash on routine flight; others had crashed Jan. 25, 1966, and April 13, 1967. (AP, NYT, 10/27/67, 41)	_ JPL scientists were “delighted” with the firing of midcourse guidance engine, and with transmission of pictures of Mars taken by Mariner IV more than two years ago. Scientists reported “a flawless burn . . . [which] proved we can restart engines in space years after we’ve put them there.” Future spacecraft, exploiting this success, could be launched to distant planets where they could take close-up photographs, swing back toward earth, and, on command, transmit pictures. Mariner IV had taken pictures of Mars from an altitude of 5,500 mi; 21 frames had been exposed and recorded on magnetic tape to be telemetered to earth over a 10-day period. As of 8:00 pm edt Oct. 27, Mariner IV was in its 1,062nd day of flight, 35,604,255 mi (57,299,604 km) from earth, and traveling at 3.91 mps (6.29 kps) relative to earth.

Sixty-day Sealab III experiment would be conducted 430 ft below the Pacific off San Clemente Island in winter 1967 as part of usn’s “Man-in-the-Sea” program. Underwater laboratory would be staffed by five eight-man diving teams rotating on 12-day shifts. Aquanauts would conduct experimental salvage techniques and oceanographic and marine biology research; and undergo series of physiological and human performance tests. Sealab Ill’s long-range goal was to develop capability for rescue and salvage operations under ocean’s surface and to determine how submerged continental shelf could be used militarily. In Sealab I experiment, conducted July 20-30, 1964, four divers were submerged 192 ft beneath the Atlantic; in Sealab II, Aug. 28-Oct. 10, 1965, three teams of 10 divers alternated in spending two-week periods 205 ft beneath the Pacific off La Jolla, Calif, (dod Release 72-67) performing photosynthesis. Sullivan concluded: “Despite the perceptible swing of the pendulum toward the possibility of life on Mars, a wide disparity of views on the nature of the Martian environment was presented at the meeting. It was evident that the information is still insufficient to assess the likelihood of life on Mars or even to design experiments for landings there that would most effectively test for the existence of life. . . .” (Sullivan, NYT, 2/12/67, 12E)
NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell wrote to the Editor of Aerospace Technology: “In 1973, NASA proposes to conduct the first of the Voyager series of missions to Mars, using the Saturn launch vehicle. We wish to call the attention of the scientific community to the opportunity of proposing experiments for this initial flight_ “. . . Regardless of the level of funding support obtained for Voyager this fiscal year, it is our plan to begin evaluating scientific proposals on Nov. 1, 1967, and to select scientists for participation in the planning and development steps by Feb. 1968....” (Aero Tech, 8/28/67, 8)

Conclusion in Mar. 24 Science article by Bruce C. Murray of Cal Tech and his associates about probable contamination of Mars and Venus by U.S.S.R.’s Zond 11 and Venus III received comment from Dr. Richard W. Porter, member of International Relations Committee of NRc’s Space Science Board, and from Britain’s leading radio astronomer, Sir Bernard Lovell. Murray and associates had presented information: tracking data from Jodrell Bank Experimental Station had indicated that Zond II, launched Nov. 30, 1964, had been on collision course with Mars, terminating Aug. 6, 1965; Mstislav Keldysh, President of Soviet Academy of Sciences, had said Zond II would pass within 1,448 km (900 mi) of Mars; Venus III, launched Nov. 12, 1965, may have crashlanded on Venus’ surface Mar. 1, 1966; radio communications had been maintained with Venus III throughout the flight hut were lost as the probe approached Venus; no telemetric data were received in final moments before impact. In a letter to editor of Science, Porter wrote: “Their conclusion with respect to Venus is based largely on what was not said by the Soviets about sterilization of the flyby bus and on the authors’ assumption that the capsule separation and bus deflection maneuvers were not made automatically, even after loss of radio contact.” Porter said authors’ conclusion about Mars was also based on insufficient evidence and noted that in discussions with “highly placed” Soviet scientists during spring 1965, he had received impression that Zond II’s miss distance was likely to be much greater than 900 mi. In his letter to editor of Science regarding Murray and associates’ statements on probable contamination of Mars and Venus, Sir Bernard Lovell noted that Zond II’s signals were so strong that there should have been no difficulty in tracking the probe at Mars encounter; also, miss distance of 1,500 km (932 mi) was within the accuracy of Jodrell Bank calculations. Sir Bernard Lovell would “prefer to accept the statement of the President of the [Soviet] Academy [of Sciences (Keldysh) ] about the miss distance. . . .” (Science, 3/24/67, 1505-11; 8/4/67, 487-8)
St. Louis Univ. scientists Drs. F. C. Bates and Albert Pallman were studying structure and circulation of the lower Martian atmosphere to aid nasa in deciding whether to use a hard- or soft-landing spacecraft on first Mars mission, (upi, NYT, 8/17/67,24)
NASA successfully conducted at WSMR second of five balloon-launched parachute tests to determine effectiveness of parachutes as decelerators in soft-landing unmanned instrumented capsules on Mars. On ground command, 815-ft-long balloon released disc-shaped flight unit containing parachute, eight acceleration rockets, and 500-lb payload at 129,000ft altitude, where earth atmosphere is as thin as that of Mars. Rockets then propelled unit to 140,000-ft altitude; parachute deployed and descended with payload into planned recovery area. Test was part of LaRC’s Planetary Entry Parachute Program to investigate parachute landing systems for Voyager program, (nasa Release 67-170; Roswell Daily Record, 7/28/67; AP, NYT, 7/29/67, 7)
