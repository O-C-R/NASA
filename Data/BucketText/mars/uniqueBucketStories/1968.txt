NASA announced plans to use Titan III—D/Centaur in dual launches of 6,000-lb spacecraft consisting of Surveyor-type soft landers mated to Mariner 1971 class Mars orbiters in mid-1973, in Project Viking, to obtain scientific information on life on Mars. Launched 10 days apart, spacecraft would arrive about seven months later, when orbiter propulsion systems would place orbiters and landers in Mars orbit. After reconnaissance, landers would be detached and softland on Mars. (NASA Release 68—207; Pasadena Independent, 12/6/68)
Preliminary “pathfinder” flights could delay U.S.S.R.’s first manned lunar and planetary flights, according to Soviet scientist Vasili Parin in Sovetskaya Rossiya. “Experiments with animals,” preceding interplanetary flight, he said, “will take many months and perhaps many years.” (upi, NYT, 5/4/68, 66)
NASA announced it had authorized JPL to proceed with construction of two Mariner spacecraft for 1971 Mars orbit with funds allocated under approved FY 1969 NASA appropriations bill. In combined mission to assist in establishing touchdown sites for 1973 Mars lander mission, spacecraft would be launched by Adas-Centaur boosters into orbit around Mars to examine Mars polar cap, provide high-resolution coverage of selected areas, and permit oblique views of broad areas of Mars’ surface and, possibly, its moons, Phobos and Deimos. Each spacecraft would complete trip from earth to Mars in six months, with May 1971 launch and November 1971 arrival, and would orbit Mars for three months or more, (nasa Release 68—196; B Sun, 11/14/68, A10; W Post, 11/14/68, D16)
May 28: In second Mars lander experiment [see April 23] NASA concluded JPL B&D program demonstrating feasibility of sending lightweight scientific capsules to Mars by successful 250-ft free-fall drop of 63-lb heat-sterilized planetary landing craft from hovering helicopter onto asphalt pavement at Goldstone Tracking Station. Capsule, which struck at 80 mph, or impact of 2,500 g, was powered by 12-cell silver-zinc battery which produced sufficient electricity after impact to extend wind gauge and to operate radio transmitter and timer aboard Mars lander. Battery was believed to be toughest yet developed, (nasa Release 68— 152; W Star, 9/8/68, A17; Pasadena Independent Star-News, 9/8/68; NYT, 10/15/68, 34; jpl Lab-Oratory 7/68, 8)
JPL soil sciences group, headed by Dr. Roy E. Cameron, reported tests and cultures of Antarctic soil samples in JPL’s walk-in freezer laboratory to determine what micro-organisms lived in extreme cold and to help determine whether life existed on Mars. Samples had come from high, dry valleys in Victorialand near U.S. base at McMurdo, Antarctica. Scientists discovered bacteria, yeasts, molds, and algae, which began to grow within two weeks when Antarctic soil kept laboratory-frozen for over one year was subjected to temperature 68° F or above. Studies were sponsored by nasa and nsf. (nasa Release 68—73)
nasa announced it would launch two Mariner spacecraft, F and G, on flyby missions to Mars in 1969. Project responsibility was assigned to JPL; LeRC would be responsible for launch vehicle. Deep Space Network stations would provide tracking and communications during launch period scheduled between mid-February and mid-April. Spacecraft would reach Mars between end of July and mid-August. Arrival dates of two spacecraft would not be less than five days apart. Atlas-Centaur combination would for first time be used as launch vehicle for planetary exploration. Spacecraft would weigh approximately 900 lb. Mariner III (Nov. 5, 1964) weighed 575 lb.

First recording of pulsar signals at short wavelengths, 2293 me, was made by Drs. Alan MofEet, Ronald D. Ekers, and Richard M. Goldstein of Cal Tech, using 210-ft Mars dish antenna at Goldstone Tracking Station operated by JPX. for NASA. Signals’ energy indicated origin from natural source such as white dwarf stars or neutron stars. CP—1919, one of three pulsars observed, was weakest source ever recorded. At 2293 me, signal was one-hundredth that of other two, though at longer wavelengths signal was one of two strongest of four known pulsars. (“CP” referred to Cambridge pulsar list; number indicated location.) Dr. Moffet placed pulsars 100 to 10,000 light years from earth, in Milky Way Galaxy. Although signal strengths varied, periods remained constant. (Cal Tech Release; Pasadena Independent, 5/15/68)
Tass reported Moscow scientist had compared “spectrometric analysis” of cactus growing in cold areas with spectrographs of “dark areas” of Mars and concluded areas on Mars were covered with cactus-like vegetation. Other tests on cactus, scientists said, proved it could stand extremes of temperature and other conditions similar to those on Mars. (upi, W Star, 4/28/68, A3)
