April 22: NASA announced that it had awarded a $1.1 billioncontract to Lockheed Corporation of Calabasas, California andGenCorp, Inc. of Fairlawn, Ohio, for the development of the SpaceShuttle advanced solid rocket motor (ASRM). The ASRM, which wouldreplace the current Shuttle SRMs built by Morton Thiokol, would bea next©generation solid fuel propulsion system that would use anelongated single rocket casing instead of the current segmentedcase design. According to NASA, the new design would improveShuttle safety and performance, allowing an additional 12,000©poundpayload capacity aboard the orbiters. Lockheed and GenCorp wouldeventually replace Morton Thiokol as prime contractors for Shuttlesolid rocket propulsion. A faulty field joint on one of Thiokol'ssegmented boosters was blamed for the catastrophic explosion of theSpace Shuttle Challenger in 1986. Under the terms of the seven©yearcontract, Lockheed's Missile System division and GenCorp's AerojetSpace Booster Company would design, develop, and test the newgeneration of motors, and produce enough for six Shuttle flightsbeginning as early as 1994. The contract also had an option, valuedat approximately $1 billion, for NASA to purchase ASRMs for 40additional Shuttle flights and eight test firings.

July 20: This date marked the twentieth anniversary of the firstcrew©assisted landing on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil A.Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin.  Armstrong, Aldrin, and theircrewmate, Michael Collins, commemorated the lunar landing withceremonies at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC,and the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.  During theWashington ceremony, attended by President George Bush and VicePresident Dan Quayle, the President proposed a long range programof human©assisted space exploration, including a permanentlyhabitable base on the Moon and a crew expedition to Mars, but didnot establish a specific timetable. The President cited SpaceStation Freedom as an important stepping stone toward missions tothe Moon and Mars. Speaking at the National Air and Space Museum,Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to step on the lunar surface,said: "The Apollo program enjoyed a certain nobility of purpose©©aprogram not to conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance.

August 2: A report by the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)entitled "Round Trip to Orbit: Human Space Flight Alternatives"recommended construction of a fifth Space Shuttle orbiter or aShuttle©derived launch vehicle in preparation for the Space Stationassembly missions of the late 1990s.

August 25: After travelling 4.4 billion miles over twelve years,the Voyager 2 space probe completed its fourth and final planetaryencounter by passing Neptune at a distance of 3,042 miles. Duringthe Neptune encounter, Voyager 2 discovered six new moons ofNeptune, a set of faint rings around the planet, auroral activityon Neptune and Triton, and a surprisingly dynamic atmospherecontaining large storm systems. Additionally, 
Voyager 2 obtained closeup images of Neptune's two largest moons,Triton and Nereid. Voyager 2 and its sister spacecraft, 
Voyager 1, were launched in 1977 for planned encounters withJupiter and Saturn. After its Saturn encounter, Voyager 1 wassteered away from the plane of the solar system toward interstellarspace, while the Voyager 2 mission was expanded to take advantageof a rare alignment of the large outer planets, which made possiblea "grand tour" of the outer solar system. With its power supply andall major mechanical systems still operative, Voyager 2 encounteredUranus in 1986, discovering rings and several new moons around theplanet. Advances in radio receiving technology allowed continuedcommunication with 
Voyager 2 despite the spacecraft's extremely faint signal. At theconclusion of the Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune, the craft wouldsteer clear of the plane of the solar system and continuetravelling into interstellar space. In anticipation of a possibleretrieval of the craft by intelligent extraterrestrial beings, bothVoyager spacecraft carried plaques bearing hieroglyphic messagesthat indicated their origins on Earth and contained images of ahuman male and female in a gesture of greeting. The spacecraft alsocarried a gold©plated phonographic record of sounds from Earth,including greetings in all of the world's major languages and theÔ  ‰ ?  Ôsounds of several animal species.

The Atlantislaunch had been delayed by a week because of problems with acomputer, a main engine master control device, and, finally, rain.Shortly after reaching orbit, Atlantis released the Galileo probeand the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) from the cargo bay. The IUSsubsequently fired Galileo on a trajectory toward Venus, inpreparation for a gravity assist maneuver that would swing thespacecraft back toward Earth twice and onward to Jupiter. Galileowas scheduled to reach Jupiter in December 1995, whereupon it wouldbegin orbiting the planet for 22 months of observations of theJovian system.

October 19: Soviet and western planetary scientists announcedresults from the Phobos 2 mission to Mars and the moon Phobos.Despite the premature loss of spacecraft transmissions because ofa computer error, scientists revealed that valuable data had beenobtained from the two©month period preceding the loss ofcommunications. The new findings showed that Mars has no magneticfield of its own and that incoming solar particles impact directlywith the planet's ionosphere. Researchers hypothesized that thedirect interaction between the solar wind and Mars' upperatmosphere may have been responsible for the depletion of theplanet's original atmosphere, as ionospheric particles weregradually electrified by the incoming solar particles. Theobservations suggested that Mars may have had an atmospherecomparable to Earth's during the first billion years after planetformation, and that conditions for the appearance of life may haveÔ  ‰ ? €% Ôprevailed during that time.
