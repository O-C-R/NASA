FOREWORD
A chronicle of scientific and technological events in the exploration of space offers useful perspective. To those of us engaged in these activities, it provides an inventory of the crowded kaleidoscope of swift-moving domestic and foreign events. To others interested in space exploration, it helps provide a sense of pace and a clearer awareness of genuine achievements as well as greater things to come.
Events of 1961 are mingled with the past and the future. The groundwork of this year’s milestones was laid several years ago. The scientific discoveries of Explorers IX, X, and XII; the suborbital Mercury flights of Alan B. Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom; the attainment of near-design speed (mach 6) and altitude (50 miles) of the X-15 rocket research airplane; the impact of Tiros satellites on global weather forecasting; and the successful first flight of the Saturn booster for large space payloads of the future—these were among the highlights of 1961. The decisions and programs undertaken this year will come to fruition in the months and years ahead.
The national character of the space program is evidenced in the contributions by American industry, the scientific community, the military services, and other Government agencies. Growing public recognition of the value of increased scientific knowledge and the ultimate benefits for society of the total space effort was also evident. Known and unpredictable promises of tomorrow spur everyone ahead in attaining the high goals of the national space program.
As our broad-basea scientific program and the development of a space transportation technology underwrote the events of 1961, it was also the year in which man himself first flew in space. Such was a thrilling reminder that the best interests of all mankind must ever provide the purpose and application of space exploration.
James E. Webb,
Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

PREFACE
This chronology represents but a first step in the historical process of fully recording and explaining the myriad activities, accomplishments, and problems of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the exploration and exploitation of space for the benefit of all mankind. It was prepared from open public sources. Since science and technology are fundamentally indivisible, events of space-related efforts by other governmental agencies including the Department of Defense, as well as international items of a non-NASA character, have been included to help provide the fuller context of current history. We are appreciative of the generous help of NASA offices and centers and interested members of the historical community.
This chronicle for 1961 is supplemental to “Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1915-1960,” published by NASA (Government Printing Office, Superintendent of Documents). Appendix A: “Satellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flight, 1961,” prepared by Dr. Frank W. Anderson of the NASA Historical Office, is an updating of Appendix A of “Aeronautics and Astronautics.”
A chronology is but a preliminary tool of the historical process and cannot be regarded as being definitive. Historical bookkeeping and auditing are a continuous process prefatorial to full-fledged analysis. Additional comments and criticism are welcome at any time.
Eugene M. Emme,
The NASA Historian.

September 24: Speaking at the Air Force Association convention in Philadelphia, Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, Commander of the Air Force Systems Command, said that “the United States has been notably slow to recognize the military application of new inventions. Two of the most significant inventions of this century— the airplane and the liquid-fuel rocket—are American inventions. Yet in each case their first application was made by other nations.” Gen. Schriever also stated: “We should recognize that there is no inherent difference between basic military and nonmilitary space technology. What really matters is not the technology but the intent * * * space power must become a vital part of our national strength and security.”
----- NASA made a grant to Stanford University’s School of
Medicine for development of design of payload instrumentation to determine existence of life forms on nearby planets, a project under the direction of Dr. Joshua Lederberg and Dr. Elliott C. Leventhal.
September 25: In a stirring address to the Assembly of the United Nations meeting in New York, President John F. Kennedy called for “world law in the age of self determination” rather than a “world war in the age of mass extermination.” Among basic proposals for waging effective peace, he urged “keeping nuclear weapons from seeding new battlegrounds in outer space.” In projecting the theme that “the events and decisions of the next 10 months may well decide the fate of man of the next 10,000 years,” President Kennedy spoke of the impact of space exploration as follows:
“As we extend the rule of law on Earth, so must we also extend it to man’s new domain—outer space.
“All of us salute the brave cosmonauts of the Soviet Union. The new horizons of outer space must not be riven by the old bitter concepts of imperialism and sovereign claims. The cold reaches of the universe must not become the new arena of an even colder war.
“To this end, we shall urge proposals extending the United Nations Charter to the limits of man’s exploration in the universe, reserving outer space for peaceful use, prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space or on celestial bodies, and opening the mysteries and benefits of space to every nation * *

Citing Associate Administrator Seamans, Deputy Associate Administrator Dixon, and Director of Manned Space Flight Holmes as examples, Mr. Webb added: “These men, and many others associated with them, know the technical side of aeronautics and space and are all experienced in the management of large activities. Each has demonstrated a personal earning capacity far beyond what the Government is able to pay for their services. Each is thoroughly familiar with the opportunities and problems associated with our most important technical military weapon system development efforts. It is fortunate for this Nation that men with these high qualifications and such experience are willing to forego large earnings in industry and a more normal personal and family life to supply the leadership needed in our national space effort.”
-----Launch of Mercury-Scout canceled at T minus 10 seconds at
Atlantic Missile Range because of mechanical difficulties, while record speed flight of X-15 was again prevented by cloud cover restricting instrumentation.

November 21: In a speech on “Our National Program in Space,” NASA Administrator Webb said:
“In carrying out its responsibilities, NASA cooperates with and depends upon private industry, universities, and many other Government agencies—not only the Department of Defense, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Bureau of Standards, but the Weather Bureau, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Agency, the National Science Foundation, and others.
“It has been only 4 years since the first manmade satellite orbited the Earth. Since then, progress in this new field of space has been tremendous. I believe that in the years ahead the rate of progress will trace a steeply ascending curve. I believe also that the many problems we will solve to achieve manned exploration of space will create a wealth of new materials, consumer goods, processes, and techniques, thus opening a host of new jobs, careers, opportunities for investment, and a general national growth.
“We can be first in space if we advance our scientific and technical knowledge at the most rapid rate possible, and if we go forward with the sustained effort that it requires. That is the basis of our national space effort.”

----- General Curtis E. LeMay, Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, said
in interview with U.S. News & World Report:
“I think we’re at the period of space technology that we were in aeronautical technology along about 1914. At that time no one could predict the type of weapon systems that the airplane was going to produce, or the transportation system that it would eventually produce. As a matter of fact, it was pretty much a laughing stock—a very expensive toy.
“We, of course, initially did a very poor job in our development program to advance the science of aeronautics in this country. I hope we do a better job in space. At the present time we can’t predict what will eventually come out of research in space in the way of weapon systems or commercial vehicles or any other use that we might put space to. I am sure that men are going out into space. I’m sure that they’ll find useful things to do out there, and I’m sure that, unless something is done to preclude it, they’ll find things to fight over out there, too.”
68 AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1961

------ Thomas F. Dixon, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator, in
speech before the Greater Los Angeles Press Club, reviewed west coast space projects and said:
“All of these projects are part of a unified national program, which was accelerated earlier this year. I want to emphasize that this is a national program. It is not just a NASA program. It is not just a government program. It is a program to mobilize America’s manpower and resources to meet the goals we have set for ourselves in space.”

December 2: Twelve Canadian Black Brant rockets for upper-atmosphere research were to be launched from NASA’s Wallops Station, Virginia, as the Canadian Defence Research Board shifted the firing site from Fort Churchill because a fire largely destroyed the Canadian facilities. Capable of carrying a 150-pound payload to an altitude of 150 miles, Black Brants were to be fired from Wallops at the rate of two in December 1961, two in February 1962, six in April 1962, and two in May 1962.
December 4: Ambassador Adlai Stevenson introduced a resolution before the U.N.’s Political Committee for a U.N. space program guided by four considerations: (1) Application of the principles of international law to outer space and celestial bodies to ensure against sovereignty claims in space; (2) making the U.N. a clearinghouse for use of outer space, including information on satellite launchings and cooperation for peaceful use of outer space; (3) international cooperation on weather satellite information; (4) international cooperation on communications satellites.
Ambassador Stevenson said: “There is a right way and a wrong way to get on with the business of space exploration. In our judgment, the wrong way is to allow the march of science to become a runaway race into the unknown.
“The right way is to make it an ordered, peaceful and cooperative and constructive forward march under the aegis of the United Nations.”

----- Italian Air Force crew fired Jupiter IRBM from Atlantic
Missile Range, the third such launching.
December 7: NASA postponed its projected manned orbital flight from December 1961 until early in 1962 because of minor problems with the cooling system and positioning devices in the Mercury capsule, Dr. Hugh Dryden, Deputy Administrator of NASA, said in a Baltimore interview. “You like to have a man go with everything just as near perfect as possible. This business is risky. You can’t avoid this, but you can take all the precautions you know about.”
----- Plans for the development of a two-man Mercury capsule were
announced by Robert Gilruth, Director of NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center. The two-man capsule, to be built by McDon-nel Aircraft Corp., would be similar in shape to the Mercury capsule but slightly larger and two to three times heavier. Its booster rocket was announced to be the USAF Titan II, scheduled for flight test early in 1962. One of the major objectives in the two-man capsule program would be a test of orbital rendezvous, in which the two-man capsule would be put into orbit by the Titan II and would attempt to rendezvous with an Agena stage put into orbit by an Atlas rocket. Total cost for a dozen two-man capsules plus boosters and other equipment was estimated at $500,000,000. Program name later announced as Gemini.

The resolution essentially incorporated the four-point U.S. program on the peaceful uses of outer space. The U.S.S.R. supported the resolution although it had previously rendered the Committee inoperative by boycotting its meetings.
------ The national space program portends a major technological
advance for mankind, NASA Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., told the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce. Comparing its potential to that of the invention of the steam engine, Dr. Seamans noted:
“Two aspects of such major advances are characteristic. First, the practical results are largely unforeseeable, primarily because they develop on broad fronts and, frequently, in unsuspected directions. Second, the concentration of effort required does not diminish effort expended on other frontiers of knowledge, but rather spurs such activities. For example, despite fears that space technology would monopolize the scientific effort of this country, such fields of activity as oceanography, geophysics, and the physics of high-energy particles have greatly increased since the national space effort has become a serious one.”
------ Contract awarded by Army Engineers to Brown & Root, Inc.,
for design of major portion of NASA’s Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston, Tex.

74 AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1961
December IS: NASA Administrator James E. Webb said in a speech in Cleveland that the United States would follow its first manned orbital flight in January 1962 with similar manned orbital flights every 60 days. These would gather data on effects of weightlessness, needed to determine the pacing of the two-man flight program later on. Mr. Webb also forecast the launching of 200 sounding rockets, 20 scientific satellites, and 2 deep-space probes in 1962.
—■—- USAF completed Titan I research and development test flight program of 40 launches at the Atlantic Missile Range; of the 40 launches 4 had been failures.
December 14: NASA fired a four-stage solid-fuel Trailblazer rocket from Wallops Station, Virginia, in the first of a series of reentry tests. Two stages boosted the rocket to 167 miles; then the other two drove the nose cone down through the atmosphere at 14,000 miles per hour.
----- Nike-Zeus firing in extended range from Point Mugu attained
all test objectives.
December 15: NASA’s Explorer XII satellite returned voluminous data revising previous information on the Van Allen radiation belts and showing them to be no substantial problem to manned space flight. Launched on August 15, 1961, and transmitting until December 6, 1961, Explorer XII returned information amounting to 5,636 telemetry tapes (2,400 feet each). Of principal interest was its finding that the Van Allen belts consist of a preponderance of protons over electrons in a ratio of 1,000 to 1. Since the protons are of less than 1 million electron volts energy, they do not themselves offer a serious radiation problem and serve to slow the velocity of other radiation.
-----S-IB stage of the Advanced Saturn launch vehicle would be
built by the Boeing Co., NASA announced. The $300 million contract, to run through 1966, called for development, construction, and test of 24 flight stages, plus several for ground tests. Assembly would take place at the NASA Michoud Operations Plant, New Orleans, La. The S-IB would be the first stage of the vehicle that would launch the three-man Apollo spacecraft for direct circumlunar flight or, with rendezvous, for lunar landing.
—■—- In a ceremony at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., the USAF graduated its first class of five pilot-engineers from its school for space pilots. Graduates were awarded advanced technical degrees.
December 18: Dr. Robert Jastrow, Chief of Theoretical Division and Director of the Institute for Space Studies, Goddard Space Flight Center, making the 25th annual Wright Brothers’ Lecture before the Institute of Aerospace Sciences, reviewed progress in the space sciences, said the most exciting and fruitful area thus far had been investigation of “solar control over the atmosphere of the Earth, causes of weather activity in the lower atmosphere, and the structure of the upper atmosphere.”
—■—— NASA announced that the first station in a network of data-gathering stations for use with second-generation satellites had been completed near Fairbanks, Alaska. Site for the second of the $5 million installations, each with a high-gain antenna 85 feet in diameter, was announced to be Rosman, N.C., 40 miles southwest of Asheville.
AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1961	75
December 18: USAF awarded an additional $52 million contract to North American Aviation for development of a prototype B-70 bomber, bringing to $267 million the amount allocated for the B-7°.
------ Capsule from Discoverer XXXVI was ejected from orbit after
6 days and a record of 64 orbits, landed in the Pacific near Hawaii, was kept afloat by 3 USAF pararescue men until arrival of Navy destroyer.
------ USAF Minuteman ICBM successfully fired from a silo and
traveled 3,600 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range, the second consecutive successful silo launching.
------ Successful test of a new way to steer large-size rockets was
announced by United Technology Corp., an experimental method called liquid thrust vector control (TVC), in which a gas or liquid is sprayed into the exhaust path of a rocket engine, deflecting the exhaust and thereby turning the vehicle. The test was made with a 450,000-pound-thrust solid-fuel engine.
------ DOD summary statement on the X-15 program stated that
to that date there had been 45 flights of the X-15, with planned performance achieved on 42 and the prime research objectives achieved on 40. The 98-percent launch success record of the X-15 was attributed to (1) use of alternate modes for subsystems and (2) the presence of a pilot to detect malfunctions in subsystems. This compared to a 43-percent launch record for an unmanned missile with no alternate modes in subsystems.
December 19: NASA announced that Ira H. Abbott, Director of Advanced Research and Technology, would retire in January after 32 years service with NACA and NASA. Beginning with the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory in 1929, Abbott became internationally known for his aerodynamic research, in more recent years as supervisor of X-15, supersonic transport, nuclear rocket, and advanced reentry development programs.
December 19-20: A technical conference on problems of runway slush in winter jet operations was held in Washington under joint sponsorship of the Federal Aviation Agency and NASA. The conference, open to aviation representatives, reviewed the extensive research flight tests conducted at FAA’s National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center and other experimental and theoretical work done at NASA’s Langley Research Center. Interest in all experiments centered on the adverse effects of runway slush on takeoff and landing characteristics of jet aircraft. Research findings were that on both takeoff and landing in heavy slush jetliners tend to act like “a sailboat without a keel,” that at takeoff speeds heavy slush causes jetliners to lose the effect of nose wheel steering and most of their braking power. Recommendations included the devising of a quick and accurate means of measuring runway slush and suspension of jet operations when slush reached a depth of 1 inch.
December 20: X-15 No. 3 made first flight, a successful test of new automated control system, NASA’s Neil A. Armstrong as pilot in his first flight of XLR-99-engined X-15. At half throttle, X—15 reached speed of 2,502 miles per hour and an altitude of 81,000 feet.
76 AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1961
December 20: NASA announced that Douglas Aircraft had been selected for negotiation of a contract to modify the Saturn S-IV stage by installing a single 200,000-pound-thrust, Rocketdyne J-2 liquid-liydrogen/liquid-oxygen engine instead of six 15,000-pound-thrust P. & W. hydrogen/oxygen engines. Known as S-IVB, this modified stage will be used in advanced Saturn configurations for manned circuinlunar Apollo missions.
-----Two new radiotelescopes, one at Cambridge University and
the other at Jodrell Bank, would be constructed with grants from Britain’s Department of Scientific and Industrial Research totaling $3,360,000. The Cambridge telescope would consist of three 52-foot paraboloidal aerials, two fixed and one rail-mounted, designed to examine a limited area of the sky with greater precision than present equipment. The Jodrell addition would be a 125-foot telescope to be used in conjunction with the present 250-foot telescope.
-----USAF launched Atlas ICBM from Cape Canaveral with a
rhesus monkey in a side-mounted pod on a flight 5,000 miles long and 600 miles in altitude. The flight was intended to produce information on reactions to launch and reentry conditions much more severe than in human flights. The monkey survived the flight but recovery attempts failed.
-----In San Bernardino news conference, Gen. Bernard Schriever,
U.S. Air Force, said: “I have never felt we were behind Russia in missile development.”
December 21: Army Nike-Zeus antimissile missile successfully intercepted a Nike-Hercules missile flying at over 3,000 miles per hour over White Sands Missile Range, while another Nike-Zeus made highest flight to date from Point Mugu and another Nike-Zeus was launched from Kwajalein Island in the South Pacific.
December 22: Unnamed USAF satellite launched from Point Arguello, Calif. The announcement said it was powered by an Atlas-Agena B combination and that the satellite was “carrying a number of classified test components.”
----- NASA selected Air Products & Chemicals to supply additional
liquid hydrogen for west coast development projects, a $35 million contract to be negotiated for a 5-year period.
December 26: Development time schedule for Dyna-Soar was reduced when DOD authorized the USAF to move directly from B-52 drop tests to unmanned and then manned orbital flights. This eliminated the previous interim stage of suborbital flights to be powered by the Titan II booster. USAF announced it was canceling the Titan II development contract held by the Martin Co. and negotiating a new contract for a larger booster.
----- Ten scientific organizations recommended that the American
Association for the Advancement of Science create a new section to deal with scientific information and communication. The problem was seen to be one of an overabundance of information not accessible for the scientist, particularly in interdisciplinary science. Only three other new sections have been created in the American Association for the Advancement of Science in this century.
AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1061	77
December 27: The “race in space” between the United States and U.S.S.R. was the top news story of 1961, with the Berlin crisis running second, according to a poll of Associated Press member newspapers and radio stations.
—■—— Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, speaking before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said that although science had become a determining factor in national and international events, its effectiveness was hampered because educated men did not understand science. Yet, he said, science was truly a part of the humanities; “Who in our times can make an adequate criticism of life without knowledge of the ideals, the methods, the dynamics of science?”
------ DOD and USAF revealed that the B-70 bomber may be redesignated RSB-70 (reconnaissance-strike-bomber) and its mission changed from tracking known, fixed targets to seeking out and destroying unknown, hidden, or uncertain targets.
------ Dr. Carl Sagen, of University of California (Berkeley), disputed
the “space seed” life theory in American Association for the Advancement of Science paper. “Panspermic” theory did not seem plausible in the light of the fierce environment of space and the vastness of the universe, he said.
December 28: Titan II, an advanced ICBM and the booster designated for NASA’s two-man orbital flights, was successfully captive-fired for the first time at the Martin Co.’s Denver facilities. The test not only tested the flight vehicle but the checkout and launch equipment intended for operational use.
December 29: Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of NASA, speaking in Denver before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said: “The sheer magnitude of the manned lunar exploration program, amounting as it will to $3 billion or more [in fiscal year 1963], represents a significant application of the Nation’s resources. These billions of dollars will be spent in the laboratories, workshops, and factories of the Nation and thus constitute a significant factor in the Nation’s employment and economy generally. The personnel in the space program are not all scientists and engineers but come from every walk of life.
“The ultimate and practical purpose of these large expenditures is twofold: (1) Insurance of the Nation against scientific and technological obsolescence in a time of explosive advances in science and technology; and (2) insurance against the hazard of military surprise in space.”
------ Dr. Joseph F. Shea was appointed Deputy Director for Systems
Engineering, Office of Manned Space Flight, NASA headquarters, reporting to D. Brainerd Holmes, NASA’s Director of Manned Space Flight. Dr. Shea came to NASA from Space Technology Laboratories.
------ Dr. Arthur Rudolph was appointed Assistant Director of
Systems Engineering in NASA’s Office of Manned Space Flight. Operating out of the Marshall Space Flight Center, Dr. Rudolph would serve as liaison between vehicle development at Marshall and the manned space flight program at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston.
78 AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1961
December SO: Navy HSS-2 Sea King helicopter flown at 199 miles per hour for 3-kilometer distance claimed world record at Windsor Locks, Conn., by Commander P. L. Sullivan, U.S. Navy, and Capt. D. A. Spurlock, U.S. Marine Corps.
December 31: NASA established a Management Council to ensure the orderly and timely progress in the manned space flight programs. The Council, composed of senior officials from NASA headquarters, Marshall Space Flight Center, and the Manned Spacecraft Center, and chaired by D. Brainerd Holmes, Director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, would meet at least once a month to identify and resolve problems as early as possible and to coordinate the interface problems.
------ Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Associate Administrator,
said in a radio interview that a second Venus probe had been added to NASA’s 1962 program as insurance for the first probe scheduled in August. Both probes would be the Mariner R, the reduced-weight version resorted to because of time slippage in the Centaur booster program. Dr. Seamans also said the United States plans three attempts to land instrumented packages on the Moon in 1962.
During December: General Electric announced operation of the largest solar thermionic power system at GE’s solar test facility near Phoenix, Ariz. Early tests generated an output of 12.18 watts and unit has potential efficiency of 15 to 20 percent of the total solar energy input.
—----- West German Post Office indicated that it would construct
near Munich a ground station capable of handling up to 600 phone calls simultaneously for operations in late 1963 or early 1964 with Telstar and Relay type satellites.
•----- Japan’s launch facilities for its rocket research program would
be moved from Akita on the northwest coast of Honshu to Kagoshima on the southern tip of Kiushu, according to an announcement by Hideo Itokawa at the Thul International Symposium on Rockets and Astronautics in Tokyo.
------ USIA reported that U.S. space achievements were a leading
item in their overseas information program and covered all media. USIA concluded: “The policy of ‘openness’ observed in both U.S. manned space flights during the year dramatized the basic difference between the American open society and the Soviet closed society, and drew widespread approval from commentators throughout the free world. The availability of full information about the events through all news media, together with the presence of foreign correspondents—who gave firsthand, on-the-spot coverage—enabled oversea audiences to achieve a high degree of self-identification with one of the greatest adventures of our times.”
APPENDIX A
SATELLITES, SPACE PROBES, AND MANNED SPACE FLIGHTS—A CHRONICLE FOR 1961
The following chart was prepared from open public sources by Dr. Frank W. Anderson, Jr., Deputy NASA Historian. Sources included “Satellite Situation Reports” prepared by the Space Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center and the “Space Activity Summaries” prepared by NASA’s Office of Public Information. Russian data are unofficial.
It is a characteristic of documenting space flights that the data processing of telemetry requires time, sometimes in the order of months, until scientific results are available. The documentation of such results thus remains a problem resolutely attacked but not fully solved. Comments are invited.

Orbit achieved was low Earth orbit rather than the deep elliptical one planned, so data was not obtained on some of the test items. Primary objective of testing the system was achieved. The satellite reentered on Nov. 18, 1961, somewhere between 6th and 13th orbit.
Orbit achieved; on 2d of 3 planned orbits, Mercury capsule was programed into reentry because of minor difficulties with attitude jets and electrical systems; capsule landed in the recovery area near Puerto Rico about 1:28 p.m., Nov. 29,	1961, was
pieked up by U.S.S. Stormes about 2:53 p.m. the same day; chimpanzee Enos performed satisfactorily in flight and was in good condition on recovery. Flight was considered successful; no additional primate flights were felt necessary to prepare for the manned orbital flight.
