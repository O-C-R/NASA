Earlier studies of shattered rocks and quartz crystals had already convinced many researchers that an asteroid or comet fragment slammed into southeast Utah sometime between five and 100 million years ago. Impact craters such as Upheaval dome are common in the solar system, so the geologists were attempting to learn how such craters form. (Salt Lake City Tribune, Jan 10/95)January 10: Supercomputers helped scientists from the University of Arizona and the Los Alamos National Laboratory to understand the hidden mechanism by which massive stars explode. Computer simulations show that stellar explosions (supernovas) erupt unevenly from the collapsed stellar core.

(Reuters, Jan 11/95)	*Astronomers detected a gigantic mass, equivalent to 40 million Suns, in a distant galaxy that they believe to be a black hole. The discovery, announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Tucson, Arizona, was made by a team of American and Japanese scientists using a computer-linked system of 10 radio telescope dishes stretching from the Virgin Islands to Hawaii known as the Very Long Baseline Array. Since black holes, by definition, emit no visible light or other radiation, astronomers infer their presence by their strong gravitational pull on surrounding stars.  The discovery was made by observing the rotation of a disk of gas and dust surrounding a galactic nucleus.

(NASA Release 95-8)	*In experiments aimed at answering one of the most intriguing questions in particle physics and cosmology, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico produced especially strong evidence that elusive particles called neutrinos do indeed have mass. If proven, the finding means that neutrinos could constitute a major component of the mysterious invisible matter, the long-sought missing mass, that cosmologists think fills and shapes the universe and could dictate its fate. Finding a mass for the ubiquitous neutrino would help toward completing an inventory of the missing matter, a tally that will determine whether the universe will fly apart, fall in on itself, or settle on a middle path. D. Hywel White, leader of the research team, said that the most likely explanation for the observed behavior of neutrinos produced by a proton accelerator was that these particles have some as yet undetermined amount of mass.

On February 6 Discovery approached to within 37 feet of the Kristall module of the Russian Space Station Mir, where the two 100-ton spaceships flew in formation for a time. This rendezvous was a dress rehearsal for the first in a series of seven shuttle docking flights to Mir that would begin in June. This series, which will involve the Space Shuttle Atlantis, is intended to give the United States and Russia an unprecedented opportunity to combine flight operations, ground control, training activities, and research.A spacewalk, in which Dr. Bernard Harris practiced lifting the 2,600-pound Spartan astronomy satellite before stowing it for the retrun trip, helped prepare NASA for assembling the International Space Station. STS-63 was historic in several other respects. First, it was the first time that a woman pilot, Eileen M. Collins, flew the Space Shuttle. Second, it was the second time that a Russian, Vladimir Titov (who spent a record 365 days aboard Mir in 1987-88), was launched aboard a U.S. spacecraft. The shuttle flight ended with a predawn landing at Kennedy Space Center on February 11.

(Space News, Feb 20/95; Science, Feb 24/95)February 23: Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) found an oxygen atmosphere on Jupiter’s second moon, Europa. This detection was made by a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, both in Baltimore. They used data provided by HST’s Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) instrument from observations taken on June 2, 1994. Europa’s atmosphere is only one hundred billionth that of Earth. Europa, about the size of Earth’s moon, has an unusually smooth surface of solid water ice. The oxygen on Europa, whose surface temperature is -230 degrees Fahrenheit, is formed from purely non-biological processes. Water vapor and the gases oxygen and hydrogen are formed by the combination of sunlight and the bombardment of the dust and charged particles trapped in Jupiter’s intense magnetic field. (NASA Release 95-17; C Trib, Feb 23/95)February 26: Radioactive debris leaking from a large group of orbiting Russian nuclear reactors make up the puzzling clouds of junk orbiting Earth. This is the conclusion of a team of scientific sleuths who have been sifting clues for five years. The clouds, which seem destined to grow, are threatening to wreak havoc in the most crowded orbit in the heavens, roughly 600 miles up. In all, 33 nuclear-powered radar satellites that spied on the movements of Western warships were launched into orbits about 150 miles above the Earth. Afterward, as a safety precaution, Moscow boosted the old reactors into parking orbits roughly 600 miles up. Published designs of the Russian space reactors show they were filled with sodium-potassium coolant. Liquid droplets moving at kilometers a second are just as dangerous to a spacecraft as a solid object. While the drops pose no radioactive health danger to humans, they will force engineers to add more shielding to help protect new spacecraft.

The evidence was found using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT), one of three ultraviolet instruments on the Astro-2 observatory which was operated in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle Endeavour during its 17-day mission in March. Johns Hopkins University astronomers were able to detect the helium in the light from a distant quasar called HS1700+64, about 10 billion light years away. The astronomers were essentially looking at the universe when it was a quarter of its present age. The HUT data also appear to give a partial answer to the puzzle of dark matter. Calculations based on HUT’s data show that the primordial hydrogen and helium are about equal to the total amount of baryonic dark matter scientists believe exists.

Based on the Hubble observations, astronomers estimate the belt contains at least 200 million comets. The existence of a comet belt encircling our solar system-like the rings of Saturn-was first hypothesized more than 40 years ago by astronomer Gerard Kuiper. The theory remained conjecture until 1992 when ground-based telescopes began detecting about 20 large icy bodies ranging from 60 to 200 miles in diameter. Hubble was able to identify objects just a few miles across. This region is thought to be the source of the short-period comets that orbit the Sun in less than 200 years. The planet Pluto is considered by astronomers to be the largest member of the Kuiper Belt region. The comet-disk lies just beyond Neptune and might stretch 500 times farther from the Sun than Earth. The Kuiper Belt is 100 times closer to Earth than the hypothesized Oort cloud, commonly thought to be a vast repository of comets tossed out of the early solar system.

He essentially stated that the House of Representatives’ FY96 budget resolution assumes massive cuts in NASA’s efforts to study the Earth. It would turn an integrated global program into a series of disconnected and fundamentally less effective measurements. The cuts would cripple the core of the program, the Earth Observing System. The U.S. government-in partnership with scientists, private companies, and other nations must ensure that this cutting-edge research that is the foundation of Mission to Planet Earth is continued. While NASA is committed to prudent and permanent deficit reduction, further cuts to Mission to Planet Earth(and environmental research in general(seriously jeopardize an investment in the future that will return economic and quality of life benefits far in excess of what we spend today.

(Space News, Dec 11/95; WSJ, Sep 11/95)September 18: Childbirth is expected to be made safer and easier with the space-age forceps being developed by Marshall Space Flight Center with the Collins Clinic in Slidell, Louisiana. Using space program instrumentation technology, fiber optic sensors in the forceps will enable the physician to monitor forces on the infant throughout the delivery. The use of composite materials will help ensure a safer distribution of pressure on the infant. Additionally, the instrumented forceps will allow obstetrical students to learn to use forceps within safe limits before entering practice. (NASA Release 95-153)September 19: An early goal of NASA’s proposed New Millennium program is to test highly sophisticated space hardware to prove that scientific spacecraft can be built more than 30 percent smaller without sacrificing performance. The first New Millennium spacecraft will explore a comet, an asteroid, or some combination of them. Three deep space missions are to be flown by the year 2000.

(NASA Release 95-159; USA Today, Oct 26/95; Fla Today, Nov 26/95; Science, Sep 22/95)September 25: TRW received a contract to build two more Earth Orbiting System (EOS) spacecraft. EOS is the centerpiece of NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth, a long-term effort to study global climate changes. (Space News, Oct 9/95; AvWk, Sep 25/95)NASA’s Optical Transient Detector (OTD) has found a relationship between intense satellite-observed lightning activity and tornado formation. Launched April 3 aboard a Pegasus rocket, the OTD observed a peak of 60 flashes per second a minute before a tornado was seen touch the ground. (NASA Release 95-160; Space News, Oct 30/95)Microcosm Inc. is developing a rocket engine that would be the basis of a “Scorpius” family of low-cost launch vehicles. It estimates that its “Liberty” version would cost one-tenth the price of the Lockheed Launch Vehicle (LLV). Liberty involves four stages, seven propulsion pods, and 49 engines. The work started with a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract from the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization in 1993. NASA is deciding whether to fund several SBIR contracts for a one-engine “SR-S” rocket. (AvWk, Sep 25/95)September 29: To insure that new and far-reaching concepts continue to be identified, NASA has initiated a program called Advanced Concepts Research Projects. It intends to fund eight ACRP Fellows in 1996. (NASA Release 95-165; Space News, Oct 9/95; AvWk, Oct 16/95)Pioneer 11 is scheduled to end operations after an epic career. Although launched a year before Pioneer 11, Pioneer 10 inexplicably has a stronger power supply and should function for another three or four years. (NASA Release 95-163; AP, May 15/95)OctoberOctober 5: Saturn’s possible two new Moons sighted by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on May 22 are thought instead to be orbiting clumps of icy rubble. Images from the August 10 “ring plane crossing” presented a new mystery. They seem to show at least three new objects, which are in different orbits than the two May objects. An explanation is that a shattered moonlet would be brighter and more visible, than when all of its mass was compressed into a single solid body. (NASA Releases 95-172; Science, Oct 20/95)In 2004, the asteroid Toutatis will pass by Earth at a range of four times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Unlike the rotations of hundreds of asteroids have been studied with optical telescope, Toutatis nas neither a simple rotation nor a fixed pole, according to two NASA-sponsored scientists. The asteroid is 2.9 miles by 1.5 miles by 1.2 miles. No known asteroid or comet will approach Earth as close as Toutatis until the year 2060. (NASA Release 95-171; Science, Oct 6/95)October 6: A panel of industry managers and academic researchers recommends improvements in the way NASA conducts scientific research. It recommends that the agency give its chief scientist more authority, develop realistic priorities to match a slowly declining budget, combat the “insular culture” at NASA centers and subject technology to more exacting peer review. (Space News, Oct 9/95; Science, Oct 6/95)October 7: A robot alfalfa harvester is a joint project of Carnegie Mellon, NASA, and the New Holland farm equipment company. Although America lost the robot wars in the last few decades, many new applications are now seen. (NY Times, Oct 7/95; AvWk, Jun 26/95)October 10: NASA is flight testing an aircraft with controlled nose strakes that promises increased maneuverability and agility in air combat situations. The strake project, called Actuated Nose Strakes for Enhanced Rolling (ANSER), consists of two moveable “flipper-like” panels called strakes installed on the upper nose of an F-18 aircraft. The hinged four-feet long, six-inch wide panels will assist the pilot in yawing to the right or left at high angles of attack when conventional rudders lose their effectiveness. (NASA Release 95-175; Antelope Valley Press, Oct 18/95; AvWk, Nov 20/95)October 16: The HST has discovered ozone on Jupiter’s satellite Ganymede, making it one of the solar system’s rare moons that have atmospheres. Ganymede’s ozone is produced when it passes through charged particles trapped in Jupiter’s powerful magnetic field. (AvWk, Oct 16/95)HST has also imaged bright auroras of Saturn’s northern and southern poles in far ultraviolet light. The circular band centered on the north pole is an enormous auroral curtain rising as far as 1,200 miles above the cloudtops. This curtain changed rapidly over the two hour period of Hubble observations. The aurora is produced as trapped charged particles collide with atmospheric gases-molecular and atomic hydrogen in Saturn’s case. (AvWk, Oct 16/95; Science, Aug 18/95)October 18: NASA physicists have assembled the first view of the spiral structure of our solar system’s magnetic field. The aerial photo of the interplanetary magnetic field became possible as Ulysses flew over the south pole of the Sun in 1994. The method involved tracking the bright spots of radio waves excited by moving electrons ejected from the Sun at speeds over 62,100 miles per second. Such spots are caused by solar flares or other explosive events on the Sun. The travel of electrons is constrained to the large-scale magnetic field lines, much as cars follow roads. A chart of the received radio emissions shows they follow the expected spiral shape, even including kinks due to variations in solar wind speed. At these high speeds, the whole path takes about 20 minutes to Earth’s orbit. (NASA Release 95-185; W Post, Oct 23/95)October 20: Launch of Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-73). During the mission Columbia provided a calm, stable platform for 16 days of on-orbit research using the Microgravity Laboratory (USML-2) Spacelab that consisted of over 40 fluid-physics, material science, and biotechnology experiments. Columbia landed on November 5. Columbia’s window was nicked by space debris. The Space Shuttle also received a 1 cm crater in its cargo bay door, the biggest impact to date.

Originally called the “Full Scale Tunnel” when built in 1931, it was the largest wind tunnel in the world until 1945. (NASA Release 95-194; AvWk, Nov 20/95)NovemberNovember 2: The Hubble Space Telescope has provided pictures of a special type of newborn star emerging from dense, compact pockets of interstellar gas called evaporating gaseous globules (EGGs). Hubble found the EGGs, appropriately enough, in the Eagle nebula which is a star-forming region of the nearby constellation Serpens. Many EGGs are found at the tip of the two largest finger-like features protruding from the nebula’s monstrous columns of cold gas, dubbed “elephant trunks.” Photos of EGGs at different stages of being uncovered provide an unprecedented look at how stars and their surroundings appear before they are truly stars. This process of forming stars from high-speed columns of hydrogen is quite different from the process of stars forming in isolation. The EGGs appear unable to form the disks that go on to become solar systems. (NASA Release 95-190; NY Times, Nov 3/95; W Post, Nov 3/95; W Times, Nov 3/95; USA Today, Nov/95; Fla Today, Nov 3/95; AP, Nov 3/95; Newsweek, Nov 13/95)November 6: NASA’s unmanned spacecraft Wind, patrolling interplanetary space 662,000 miles from Earth, detected a “giant magnetic cloud” on October 18. An updated “space weather alert” was issued to commercial satellite operators, electrical utilities and other organizations worldwide. The disturbance was speeding to Earth at over 2.1 million miles per hour. It produced a magnetic storm and auroral displays that persisted for two days. Future disturbances are anticipated as the 11-year sunspot cycle is expected to peak shortly after the year 2000. The Wind spacecraft was launched November 1, 1994. (NASA Release 95-202; Space News, Oct 30/95)NASA suspended the X-34 program for two weeks on November 2 over the issue of whether a U.S. or a Russian engine would be used. The next day White House officials denied NASA’s request to withdraw from the government-industry team building the unmanned reusable launcher. (Space News, Nov 6/95; AvWk, Nov 6/95)Lockheed Martin plans to develop an advanced Atlas rocket to launch large commercial satellites. The “IIAR” would be ready to launch medium-lift to intermediate-lift payloads in December, 1998. This new rocket is a challenge to Arianespace, the 53-member European space consortium, and to the McDonnell Douglas Corp. (WSJ, Nov 6/95)Boeing Co. is developing a venture to use converted oil-drilling platforms to launch satellites atop Zenit rockets, which are built by NPO Yuzhnoye of the Ukraine. The plan would allow as many as 22 launches through 2001, as long as world demand for launches to geosynchronous orbits remains strong. (Space News, Dec 11/95; WSJ, Nov 6/95 & Dec 6/95)November 7: A satellite payload designed and built by college students was launched onboard a NASA launch vehicle. Shortly after launch the SURFSat-1 was separated from the primary payload and moved into a polar orbit. When the project began in 1987, six Caltech students were chosen to begin the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURFSat). Each summer a new group of undergraduates took over. Through 1994, 61 students have participated. The satellite has two experiments: one tests how Earth’s atmosphere affects the new Ka-band being implemented on NASA’s Deep Space Network, and the other tests ground stations supporting NASA’s new Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry project. The latter will be used to communicate with a Japanese spacecraft that will make radio astronomy studies of quasars and other objects at the edge of the universe. (NASA Release 95-204; Space News, Sep 4/95 & Nov 13/95)NASA will pursue a non-competitive contract with United Space Alliance to eventually assume responsibility for Space Shuttle operations. Rockwell International and Lockheed Martin Corporation, together holding 69 percent of the dollar value of all Shuttle related prime contracts, formed the joint venture, “United Space Alliance.” The non-competitive contract was clearly in the public interest as no other company could possibly meet NASA’s safety, manifest and schedule requirements.

On its second visit to Space Shuttle Mir, Atlantis added a permanent Russian-built docking port. The 15-foot, 9,000 pound docking tunnel came with two new solar arrays, one built in Russia and one provided by NASA, that would be assembled later. The link up, which occurred on November 15, required the pilot, Kenneth Cameron, to aim for a target about three inches in diameter and connect at a speed of less than one-tenth of a mile per hour. The quarter-million-pound spacecraft docked with Mir, of about the same weight, as they sped through space at 17,500 mph. They remained docked for three days. Mission STS-74 ended on November 20, paving the way toward assembly of the International Space Station beginning in November 1997. The show went on despite a possible Government shutdown. Mision Control jokingly told the five astronauts, “We expect you to show up for work, furlough or not.” (NASA Release 95-192; NY Times, Nov 13/95, Nov 15/95, Nov 16/95, Nov 19/95 & Nov 21/95; W Post, Nov 13/95, Nov 14/95, Nov 15/95, Nov 16/95, Nov 19/95 & Nov 21/95; USA Today, Nov 13/95, Nov 14/95 & Nov 20/95; Fla Today, Nov 14/95 & Nov 23/95)November 13: The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) mission will be launched in October 1998. This mission was selected earlier in the year as part of an overall restructuring of the Explorer program. Beginning in 1958, the Explorer program provides Earth-orbiting satellites to conduct research in space physics and astrophysics. (NASA Release 95-206; Space News, Nov 27/95)November 15: A temporary government shutdown is being considered. Although the Space Shuttle would remain in orbit, NASA TV(the entity that provides footage of the astronauts during the mission(could be closed. (CSM, Nov 15/95)November 17: NASA plans to create independent institutes that would take over much of the research now being performed at five NASA centers. However, many scientists fear that the reforms were hastily conceived and could shortchange NASA research. (Science, Nov 17/95)November 20: Two large aerospace contractors, Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., are investigating their merger potential. (WSJ, Nov 20/95)November 21: An international team of scientists have examined data from the Japanese/U.S. X-ray astronomical satellite “ASCA” which may confirm how cosmic rays achieve speeds near the speed of light. Enrico Fermi suggested a theory in 1949 in which charged particles are bounced between turbulent regions inside the shock front of a supernova explosion. Bouncing much like a ping pong ball between a table and a paddle as the paddle is brought closer to the table, a charged particle gains energies up to 100 trillion electron volts. The tell-tale clue to the discovery was the detection of two oppositely-located regions in the rapidly expanding remnant of the Supernova of 1006 AD. The ASCA satellite contains telescopes for simultaneously taking images and spectra of X-rays, allowing astronomers to distinguish between different types of X-ray emission from nearby regions of the same celestial object. ASCA was launched February 20, 1993. (NASA Release 95-208)November 28: A fully automated landing of a transport aircraft was made using only engine thrust for control. Landing was a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 using a Propulsion Controlled Aircraft (PCA) system at NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center. PCA is expected to become an important back-up system in the event of a loss of an aircraft’s hydraulic flight control system. (NASA Release 95-149; Fla Today, Sep 24/95; AvWk, Sep 4/95)Scientists at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center have determined a three-dimensional atomic structure of an important enzyme from one of four species of parasites that cause Schistosomiasis. Using highly specialized X-ray equipment and protein crystallization techniques developed for space-based microgravity research, they were able to perform an important step leading to the use of drugs and vaccines. Schistosomiasis affects 200 to 300 million people and is second only to malaria in cause of death worldwide. (NASA Release 95-211; Htsvl Tms, Dec 3/95)DecemberDecember 1: NASA’s Galileo spacecraft has confirmed it has reached the inside of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Direct measurements of the Jupiter system may now begin. Final tuning of the flight path is scheduled for December 2. On December 7, Galileo’s previously deployed atmospheric probe will plunge into Jupiter’s cloud tops and descend into the giant planet on a parachute. An hour after the probe mission is completed, Galileo will begin to fire its onboard rocket beginning a two year mission of close-up studies of the planet’s large moons, Jupiter itself, and the magnetosphere. The spacecraft was launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis and an Interim Upper Stage (IUS) on October 18, 1989.

The proposals are for Phase II contracts in NASA’s Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Pilot Program. The STTR program is similar to the Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIRP) but varies by requiring small business concerns to conduct cooperative research and development by partnering with a research institution. At least 40 percent of the work must be performed by the small business concern, and at least 30 percent of the work must be performed by the research institute. STTR and SBIRP comprise only some of the many research grants NASA awards each year. (NASA Releases 95-46, 103, 165, 174, 183, 199, 210 & 214)The Hubble telescope has confirmed a second super-massive black hole. Located in the direction of the constellation Virgo, it has a mass 1.2 billion times that of the Sun. First identified in Hubble observations made in 1992, new Hubble images reveal the structure within the disk. In this case the disk is off-center, which is evidence for a dynamic close encounter. Another puzzling aspect is that the black hole is offset from the center of its galaxy. (NASA Release 95-216; Science, Dec 15/95)December 15: A device invented at NASA’s Langley Research Center may protect homeowners everywhere from deadly carbon monoxide fumes. It uses a new class of low-temperature oxidation catalysts to convert carbon monoxide to non-toxic carbon dioxide at room temperature. It also can remove formaldehyde gas. (NASA Release 95-218)December 19: Dr. Daniel S. Goldin, head of the nation’s space agency, has won support in the White House for his philosophy of smaller, better, and less expensive spacecraft. A case in point is the early planning for a Pluto mission. Four years ago, engineers came up with a concept costing as much as $4 billion. After many redesigns they developed a mission, called Pluto Express, at an estimated cost of $400 million. Instead of packing many instruments into a single craft weighing several tons, engineers designed two lightweight craft weighing as little as 300 pounds each. In the proposed mission, the craft would be launched separately, perhaps by Russian Proton rockets, on “fast” trajectories. They should be able to reach Pluto in 6 to 8 years, compared to Voyager 2’s travel time of 12 years to distant Neptune. The Discovery program of small spacecraft is already a start in the direction of lower-cost flights. The large, ultimately unsuccessful Mars Observer was launched three years ago on a Titan 3 rocket costing $350 million. But craft the size now being planned could be launched with less powerful Delta rockets costing $60 million or less. (NASA Release 95-195; NY Times, Dec 19/95; Space News, Nov 27/95)December 20: In the three years since NASA began funding a group consisting of five leading origin-of-life researchers and their 20 students at four separate institutions, they have published a bevy of high-profile papers and thrown fuel on a number of long-smoldering debates. The group believes that while science may not unravel the exact origin of life, it is constantly moving toward a plausible explanation of it. (Science, Dec 22/95)
