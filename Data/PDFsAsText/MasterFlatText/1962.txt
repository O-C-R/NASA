FOREWORD
Days, weeks, months, and years of the space age clock on. Noteworthy events in space science and technology flash by at an ever-accelerating rate. Many events appearing of current importance become less so with the passage of time, while others emerge slowly as the significant milestones align themselves into the dynamic patterns of progress. Our comprehension of the meaning of astronautics to the future of mankind is likewise a growing thing. The great breadth of the social, political, economic, and strategic impact of man’s nascent steps to explore his universe must not be ignored. Yet all of us tend to become preoccupied with our problems and responsibilities near at hand.
One of the useful tools to help gain perspective and greater appreciation is a chronology of documented events. As current meaning stems from the decisions and progress of the past, so also is the future conditioned by the comprehension and the actions of the present. Prepared from open sources, this chronology has reference value of contemporary utility and will also serve the cause of future historians and analysts.
The year 1962 was only the fifth year since the Soviet sputnik opened many American eyes to the early practical significance of space science and technology. Yet it was another spectacular year in space affairs. The highlights of 1962 were many: the orbital flights of Mercury Astronauts Glenn, Carpenter, and Schirra; the successful launching of more than 61 American vehicles; the spectacular data-recording flight past the planet Venus by mariner ii, not to slight ranger v hitting the moon and the first international satellites, Ariel i and alouette. There was the continued contribution of Tiros weather satellites as well as the dramatic first live global telecommunications achieved by telstar. The rocket-powered X-l 5 research airplane continued its record-making contribution to the science and technology of manned space flight. Decisions by management and progress throughout nasa’s program also are reflected in this chronology, not to ignore the indispensable contributions of other governmental agencies, the aerospace industry, and the academic community to the massive research and development effort now well underway.
In his address at Rice University on September 12, 1962, President John F. Kennedy said that this Nation “means to be a leading space-faring nation.” These words sound the challenge for which a response must be fashioned by all Americans. While 1962 was an eventful year, the future of astronautics appears even more stimulating.

PREFACE
A chronology is not a full-fledged history. But this chronology is a necessary beginning of the historical process of documentation, analysis, and verification concerning the activities, problems, and accomplishments of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its academic, industrial, governmental, and international partners in the exploration and use of space for the benefit of all mankind.
This historical report was prepared from open, public sources. Science and technology in today’s world are essentially indivisible. Space-related efforts by the Department of Defense and the military services, as well as international items of a non-NASA character, have therefore been included to help retain a valid historical context. Any effort by a free society also manifests considerable public discussion and policy comment, the inclusion of which was considered pertinent to meaningful presentation of known events in the science and technology of space exploration. The nasa Historical Staff appreciates the generous support by various nasa offices and centers as well as by members of the historical community in compilation of this report.
Astronautical and Aeronautical Events of 1962 is supplemental to Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1915-60, published by nasa (gpo, Superintendent of Documents), as well as Aeronautical and Astronautical Events of 1961, a nasa Historical Report published in 1962 by the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Appendix A: "Satellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights—1962,” compiled by Dr. Frank W. Anderson, Jr., Assistant nasa Historian, is a continuation of Appendix A in both of the above chronologies. Appendix B: “Chronology of Major nasa Launchings, 1958-62,” originally drafted by Mr. Robert Rosholt, provides a useful catalog not previously available.
Compilation of this chronology involved the entire nasa Historical Staff with Mrs. Helen T. Wells carrying the major drafting and editorial responsibilities. Appendix A was launched by Mr. Alfred Rosenthal, Historian of the Goddard Space Flight Center, while nasa Center historians at Launch Operations Center, Manned Spacecraft Center, and Marshall Space Flight Center also made their mark in this preliminary report.
Incompleteness, perhaps errors, either by commission or omission, may require further guidance by history-makers and scholars. Comments and criticism are welcomed by the nasa Historical Staff at any time.
Eugene M. Emme, nasa Historian (afeh).

JANUARY 1962
January 1: National Bureau of Standards and U.S. Naval Observatory increased the standard frequency transmissions by 2 parts in 1 billion to allow for higher precision in scientific measurements, radio communications and navigation, and satellite tracking.
•	The United Nations should tax commercial ventures in outer space,
the ocean depths, and polar regions to obtain financial support, said Dr. Eugene Staley of the Stanford Research Institute in a memorandum to the United Nations. He also proposed that the U.N. should be given exclusive authority to license and regulate space traffic and satellites relaying telephone and television signals.
January 2: Army announced installation of new 102-foot antenna near Fort Dix built in conjunction with dod’s Project Advent, one link in development of a microwave radio-relay system for global communications using active-repeater satellites in a 22,300-mile-high orbit.
•	Walter Hahn of General Electric’s Defense System Department
was named nasa’s Director of Management Analysis Division.
January 3: nasa announced that Mercury Mark II spacecraft would be named “Gemini,” after the third constellation of the zodiac featuring the twin stars Castor and Pollux. Gemini would be a two-man spacecraft used in development of the rendezvous technique, would be 50% larger than the Mercury capsule, and launched into orbit by a Titan II booster.
•	Mercury capsule installed on top of Atlas booster preparatory for
MA-6 manned flight; it was also reported from Cape Canaveral that first American orbital manned flight was now unofficially scheduled for January 23.
•	Vice President Johnson sent a congratulatory telegram to members
of the oscar amateur radio satellite team: “For me this project is symbolic of the type of freedom for which this country stands— freedom of enterprise and freedom of participation on the part of individuals throughout the world.” oscar i was launched with discoverer xxxvi on December 12, 1961.
•	Dartmouth College announced new graduate program leading to a
doctorate in the field of molecular biology.
January 3-10: Soviet cosmonaut, Major Gherman S. Titov, visited Indonesia at the personal invitation of President Sukarno, was then scheduled to go to Burma.
January 4- Announced at the Manned Spacecraft Center that a large “innertube” or “flotation collar” may be used to keep Mercury capsule afloat after a water landing. Collar would be installed by Navy frogmen. Astronaut Alan B. Shepard took part in proving tests conducted on Chesapeake Bay.

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
January 4- nasa announced contract with the University of Texas to design and build a radio antenna at the Balcones Research Center to be used in making radiation measurements of the moon and planets. It would be 16 feet in diameter and operate effectively at 30,000 to 150,000 megacycles.
•	Dr. William W. Kellogg of the nas Space Science Board reported
on the study of the planet Venus at the American Geophysical Union. Bolometer studies of the atmosphere of Venus indicated a temperature of —40° C (presumably the cloud tops), while temperatures deduced from measurements by large radiotelescopes indicated temperatures of about 300° C (572° F) (believed to be surface temperature). A planetary probe could probably answer questions raised on the thickness and nature of Venus’ aerosphere.
January 5: President Kennedy released part of a report submitted earlier by Vice President Johnson, Chairman of the Space Council. The report stated that the U.S. had generated a greater rate of progress in space in 1961 than in any other year but that “it is too early to make definitive comparisons as between our newly developing competence and the capabilities of the U.S.S.R.”
•	nasa first made public drawings of three-man Apollo spacecraft
to be used in lunar landing development program.
•	Dr. J. P. Kuettner, formerly chief of the Mercury-Redstone pro-
gram, was named mfsc Manager of the Saturn-Apollo System Integration Program.
•	usaf Minuteman successfully fired from silo at Cape Canaveral,
its third straight success in underground firing.
January 6: faa released memorandum dated December 29, 1961, stating that Stanford Research Institute’s radiotelescope was a hazard to air navigation. The first of three such telescopes to be built in the U.S. by sri extends 90 feet too high for Moffett Field air traffic and 128 feet too high for Palo Alto Airport traffic.
January 7: National Science Foundation reported that Congress had appropriated $10.8 billion for research and development in FY 62, which included $3 billion for research, $6.7 billion for development, $1 billion for facilities, and $100 million for information. nasa spent $1.4 billion, the dod $6.2 billion.
•	Executive Director of the Space Science Board of the National
Academy of Sciences, Dr. Hugh Odishaw, reviewed the prospects in space in first of a series of lectures prepared for the Voice of America. Despite the great promise of practical application of space technology, Odishaw said: “I would contend that the challenges of research dwarf those of adventure and application.” Other members of the Space Science Board were slated for later lectures in this Voice of America series.
•	Reported by J. Alsop that experts estimate that the U.S.S.R. could
possibly test an antisatellite missile during 1962, and would probably do so in 1963.
January 8: Special hand tools for use in zero-gravity conditions were tested by personnel of the Manned Spacecraft and the Marshall Space Flight Centers. Experiments were conducted in simulated space environment to try out non-torque hand tools drawn from a number of industrial sources.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	3
January 8-13: Five-day symposium on aerospace medicine held at School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks afb, Texas, which included some 500 medical school professors, industrial scientists, military, and other Government specialists.
January 9: nasa’s Associate Administrator, Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., moderated a panel discussion on “Reliability—The Key to Space Operations,” at the 8th National Symposium on Reliability and Quality Control in Washington. Panelists John H. Rubel, Assistant Secretary of Defense; Dr. C. Stark Draper, Head of the Dept, of Aeronautics and Astronautics, mix; Dr. Simon Ramo, Exec. YP of Thompson Ramo Wooldridge, Inc.; and Dr. Jack A. Morton, VP Device Development, Bell Telephone Laboratories discussed means of comprehensive, planned efforts to increase the Nation’s percentage of success in space launchings and operations.
•	Addressing sam’s Aerospace Medicine symposium, Major General
C.	H. Mitchell, Vice Commander of afcs, said that the “Russian threat in space is becoming obvious . . . Clearly it is our responsibility as a nation to insure that space is used to benefit all mankind. We can insure this only through development of the ability to conduct military operations in space with maximum effectiveness . . .”
January 10: nasa announced that the Advanced Saturn launch vehicle, to be used for manned flights around the moon and for manned lunar landings with rendezvous technique, would have five-engined first and second stages. The first stage (S-IB) would be powered by five F-l engines (total of 7.5 million pounds thrust) and the second stage (S—II) would be powered with five J-2 engines (total of 1 million pounds thrust). A third stage (S-IVB) with a single J-2 engine would be used on escape missions.
•	X-15 No. 1 piloted by Cdr. Forrest Petersen (usn) made its first
forced landing in 47 flights when its rocket engine failed to ignite in mid-air after two attempts. X—15 was brought down without incident at Mud Lake, Nevada.
•	nasa and aec awarded 5-yr. contract for the development of the
Nerva engine to Aerojet-General Corp. At same time, Aerojet-General signed a subcontract with Westinghouse Electric Corp. for nuclear portions of the development which began in 1955.
January 11: In his State of the Union message to the Congress, President Kennedy said: “With the approval of this Congress, we have undertaken in the past year a great new effort in outer space. Our aim is not simply to be first on the moon, any more than Charles Lindbergh’s real aim was to be first to Paris. His aim was to develop the techniques and the authority of this country and other countries in the field of the air and the atmosphere.
“And our objective in making this effort, which we hope will place one of our citizens on the moon, is to develop in a new frontier of science, commerce and cooperation, the position of the United States and the free world. This nation belongs among the first to explore it. And among the first, if not the first, we shall be.
“We are offering know-how and cooperation to the United Nations. Our satellites will soon be providing other nations
4 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
with improved weather observations. And I shall soon send to the Congress a measure to govern the financing and operation of an international communications satellite system, in a manner consistent with the public interest and our foreign policy.
“But peace in space will help us naught once peace on earth is gone . . . .”
January 11: usaf B-52H flew nonstop and without refueling 12,519 miles from Okinawa to Madrid, breaking by 1,283.4 miles the 1946 record set by Navy P2V-1 “Truculent Turtle.” Maj. C. E. Evely headed crew of eight making the 21-hour-52-minute flight.
•	At sam symposium on aerospace medicine, Lt. Col. Burt Rowen
(usaf), Chief of Bioastronautics at afftc, presented heartbeat and breathing records of Maj. Robert White during X-15 record speed flight of November 9, 1961. “When the President’s Scientific Advisory Committee first became aware of the high heart and respiration rates [of pilots in high-performance aircraft] they became concerned with the question of success of the Mercury program. . . . But now this has come to be regarded as normal.” Dr. Charles Sandhous of the University of California warned that an astronaut caught in space during a solar flare might age three years or more as a result of the radiation received.
•	At Eighth National Symposium on Reliability and Quality Control
in Washington, W. T. Sumerlin of the Philco Corp. estimated that 3,000 engineers and others were now devoting full time to this “new field.”
•	E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. announced it had awarded grants
totaling $1,693,300 to 161 American universities and colleges to strengthen the teaching of science and related subjects, to promote fundamental research, and to aid facilities for education or research in science and engineering.
January 12: John Jay Ide, European representative of naca (1921-40, 1946-50) and U.S. representative at numerous international air law and commerce conventions, died in New York. He was a founder and fellow of the ias, a board member of the naa, and an honorary member of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Mr. Ide had contributed to world aviation in making known the results of naca research and in acquiring information on European progress, as well as helping the establishment of transatlantic commercial air routes.
January 18: usaf discoverer xxxvii launched from Vandenberg afb but did not attain orbit.
•	nasa launched 2-stage Aerobee sounding rocket from Wallops Sta-
tion to an altitude of 130 miles to obtain planning data for future solar physics projects.
•	Dr. Hans-Georg Clamann, Chief of Space Medicine at sam, sub-
mitted that a mountain peak near the south pole of the moon may be the ideal location for a lunar base. Continuous sunlight would provide support for growing vegetation.
•	Reported from New York that three-day U.S.-British discussions
on U.N. problems had devoted considerable time to problems of “the law of outer space.” U.S. representatives indicated that the U.N. resolution of December covering “international cooperation and the peaceful uses of outer space” had extended

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	5
international law to space. In view of this, the U.N. resolution destroyed any argument that surveillance satellites violate international law, as orbiting satellites are legally no different from operating a destroyer in international waters.
January 14: National Science Foundation released comprehensive report on “Education and Professional Employment in the USSR” by Nicholas DeWitt of the Harvard Russian Research Center.
January 15: “Big Shot” suborbital inflation test of 135-foot diameter sphere in Echo II program was conducted from amr. The 44-inch cannister containing the uninflated balloon that would be larger and more rigid than echo i was separated at altitude from a specially stabilized Thor booster which carried both TV and 16-mm movie cameras. These cameras monitored the separation of the cannister and inflation of the “balloon satellite,” showed the too-rapid inflation that ripped the balloon apart at 250-miles altitude; capsule with movie film re-entered and was later recovered by skin divers.
•	In regular press conference, President Kennedy announced that he
had asked his Science Advisory Committee, in cooperation with the Federal Council for Science and Technology, to report “as quickly as possible on the specific measures that can be taken within and without the Government to develop the necessary and well-qualified scientists and engineers and technicians to meet our society’s complex needs—government, educational and industrial.” He prefaced his announcement with a review of the declining number of scientists and engineers educated in the United States since 1951.
•	In nasa press conference in New York City, Dr. Abe Silverstein,
Director of the Lewis Research Center, outlined factors in nasa’s nation-wide recruitment of 2,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians: (1) nasa had already interviewed 4,000 candidates in other cities and hoped to screen another 1,000 in New York; (2) salaries in industry tended to be higher than in Federal employment but nasa offered better postgraduate experience as well as opportunity to acquire national or international reputation; (3) nasa’s manpower drain on the annual pool of 40-45,000 engineering graduates was small; and (4) the new specialists trained in the space program during the next decade would be an effective argument for much of the cost of the entire space effort.
January 16: In speech to the American Astronautical Society, Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, submitted that Russia could match the U.S. in space “only if we place short-run convenience ahead of our nation’s future. . . . There are those who seem to take for granted that a country like Soviet Russia, with less than half the per capita income of the United States, can afford a major successful space program, while we can not. That is, at best, ridiculous, and, at worst, deliberate sabotage.”
•	Rep. George P. Miller, Chairman of the House Committee on
Science and Astronautics, spoke to the American Astronautical Society on the broad benefits derived from the space program. He said: “Space exploration is of such immense importance to man’s total knowledge that it will benefit and alter the course of his
6 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
existence in ways no more foreseeable today than those which resulted from the invention of the wheel. . . . One of the major benefits being gleaned from this vast effort to conquer space is the stimulus which it is providing for scientific research in new and uncharted areas. . . .”
January 16: Army Pershing missile successfully fired on longest test flight to date—400 miles—from amr.
January 17: X-15 (No. 3) flown to 3,715 mph and 133,000 ft. in test of new autopilot control system, nasa’s Neil Armstrong as pilot.
•	Navy F8U Crusader piloted by Cdr. George Talley (usn) made
first aircraft landing on a nuclear-powered carrier, the U.S.S. Enterprise, off the Virginia Capes.
January 18: Administration budget for FY 63 presented to Congress by President Kennedy, nasa requests totaled $3,787,276,000, with $2,968,278,000 going to research, development, and operations, and $818,998,000 to construction, dod requests totaled $51.64 billion, with $6,843 billion going to research, development, test, and evaluation.
•	In a nasa press conference following the presentation of the Admin-
istration’s budget to Congress, Mr. James Webb, nasa Administrator, commented on the general attitude toward nasa’s doubled appropriation request: “I would say that the people I have talked to have felt that we ought to go forward with the effort at about the level the President has recommended. I have seen no indication as we have had advanced discussion with some of the leaders, like the Chairman of the House Committee, Congressman Miller, the Chairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Kerr, and with some of the Appropriations members; we have seen no disposition on their part to just simply throw up their hands and say, 'No, sir.’ Each one of them has said that what you have makes sense and we are going to look it over very carefully, of course, but nevertheless there has been no tendency to start out with a reaction that it was simply out of line with reality. . . . Under those circumstances my judgment is that there will be a good, strong, vigorous debate, just as there was when this agency was formed, and that when the issues are clearly out on the table, and the success of the very active flight program that we are now conducting makes itself felt, that there will be support for the program and that we will end up with about the recommendations of the President.”
•	nasa Goddard Space Flight Center selected Rohr Aircraft Corp.
to negotiate for the manufacture and erection of three 85-foot-diameter parabolic antenna systems to be located at Pisgah National Forest (Rosman, N.C.), Fairbanks, Alaska, and an undetermined location in eastern Canada. When completed, these facilities in addition to similar system completed at Gilmore Creek, Alaska, would serve as the core of nasa’s wide-band satellite instrumentation network. They would receive and record telemetry from large “second generation” satellites including Nimbus and the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (Oao).
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	7
January 19: At nasa press conference, scientists described preliminary scientific results obtained by explorer xii: based on study of 10 per cent of the data, it now appears that instead of the two radiation belts (previously called the inner and outer Van Allen belts) there is one magnetosphere extending roughly from 400 miles above the earth to 30,000 to 40,000 miles out. In this magnetosphere there is only a handful of matter but a very wide range of charged particles trapped by the earth’s magnetic field. Density of electrons is now considered to be 108/cm2/sec as opposed to the 1011 derived from previous satellites. Radiation levels of protons in the lower portion of the magnetosphere were found to be the same as reported by previous satellites, so that the magnetosphere still poses a formidable radiation problem to extended manned flight. At about 10 earth radii the magnetosphere ends abruptly. Above it is an extended area, about
20,000	km. across, of electromagnetic turbulence and featuring very low energy particles on the order of 1 to 20 kilovolts. Beyond this is thought to be true interplanetary space.
•	Ranger III lunar shot postponed because of technical difficulties
with Atlas booster rocket.
•	Dr. John P. Meehan of the University of Southern California
reported that “Enos,” 37-lb chimpanzee who orbited the earth in MA-5 on November 29, 1961, developed temporary hypertension during flight due to frustration and confusion caused by equipment malfunction.
•	In speech before the Builders and Contractors Exchange, Thomas
F. Dixon, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator, pointed out that one fourth of the total nasa appropriation for FY 1963 was for construction of facilities. This construction does not include that to be undertaken by other Government agencies or by the thousands of private industries, educational mstitutions, and others with a role in the space effort.
•	nasa received patent (3,016,693) for electrothermal rocket invented
by John R. Jack and Wolfgang E. Moeckel of Lewis Research Center.
•	Department of Defense authorized usaf to proceed with develop-
ment of a mobile mid-range ballistic missile (mmrbm).
•	Unnamed Soviet scientist, called “chief designer of Soviet space-
ships,” reported by Tass as saying that U.S.S.R. planned to establish an “industrial undertaking” on the moon.
January 21: nasa announced the launching of two Areas meteorological sounding rockets from Kindley afb, Coopers Island, Bermuda, the first of a series of tests to measure the structure and density of the atmosphere in support of an atmospheric re-entry experiment utilizing a Scout rocket fired from Wallops. January 22: Reported from amr that MA-6 launch would be dela.yed until January 27 at the earliest, due to difficulties in the oxygen system of the Mercury spacecraft.
•	Fuel tank of the Atlas booster of Ranger III was repaired from
inside in 48 hours, first such repair while booster was upright on the pad. Effort of General Dynamics/Astronautics crew was necessitated by fuel leak.
8	ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 19 62
January 23: nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center announced the selection of Motorola, Inc., Military Electronics Division, of Scottsdale, Ariz., as contractor for research and development on the Goddard range and range-rate tracking system. Intended for tracking satellites in near-space and cislunar space, the system will measure spacecraft position to within a few feet and velocity to within fractions of a foot per second by measurements of carrier and side-tone modulations.
•	Institute of the Aerospace Sciences awarded: the Louis W. Hill
Space Transportation Award, carrying a $5,000 honorarium, to Robert R. Gilruth, Director of nasa’s Manned Spacecraft Center, for his “outstanding leadership in technical development of spacecraft for manned space flight”; the Lawrence B. Sperry Award to Douglas G. Harvey for design, development, and testing of the first two nuclear auxiliary powerplants placed in orbit; and the Sylvanus Albert Reed Award to Alfred J. Eggers, Jr., chief of Vehicle Environment Division at nasa’s Ames Research Center, for his work on solving problems of space vehicle re-entry and alleviating heat problems at hypersonic, satellite, and escape speeds.
•	National Academy of Sciences’ Space Science Board report on the
atmospheres of Mars and Venus released. Prepared by William W. Kellogg of rand and Carl Sagen of the University of California, it reported that available evidence suggests the existence of life on Mars and that space flights during the next decade would probably resolve this question.
•	Reported by Dr. Sigmund Fritz of the Weather Bureau that tiros
iii had spotted fifty tropical storms during the summer of 1961.
•	Construction contract for Saturn umbilical tower (Launch Complex
34, Cape Canaveral) was awarded by nasa Marshall Space Flight Center to Consolidated Steel and Ets-Hokin-Galvin. Cost of the 240-ft. steel tower was estimated at $504,900.
January 24-: nasa announced Aerojet-General Corp. had been selected as the contractor for design and development of the M-l liquid-hydrogen engine. To develop 1,200,000 pounds of thrust, the M-l would be used in the Nova vehicle as propulsion for the 2nd (4 M-l engines) and 3rd (1 M-l engine) stages. Target date for the operational use of the engine was 1965, total cost of the contract expected to be $90,000,000.
•	Mr. John Stack, Director of Aeronautical Research, nasa, speaking
before the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences in New York, advocated a variable-wing, variable-fuselage configuration for the nation’s supersonic transport aircraft. Not only were these practicable for the state of the art but the only way he saw to gain the necessary subsonic vs. sonic flight characteristics and load flexibility to make the aircraft economically usable.
•	Composite I, the Navy’s 5-in-l satellite package, was launched
from amr but failed to achieve orbit when the 2nd stage of the Thor-Able-Star booster rocket misfired.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962

January 25: explorer x detected a "shadow” on the side of the earth facing away from the sun; in this shadow there is an absence of the solar “wind”, a belt of plasma moving out from the sun at about 200 miles per second but deflected around the earth by the earth’s magnetic field and creating a cone-shaped “shadow” some 100,000 miles across at its larger end. The explorer x findings were reported to the annual meeting of the American Physical Society in New York by Dr. Bruno Rossi of mit.
•	nasa approved Saturn C-5 development program and authorized
nasa Marshall Space Flight Center to direct its development.
•	“Satellite Communications Corporation” bills were introduced by
Senator Robert Kerr (S. 2650) and by Rep. George Miller (HR-9696), which would amend the nasa Act by adding a new section which would declare that it is “the policy of the United States to provide leadership in the establishment of a worldwide communications system involving the use of space satellites.” The section would create a “Satellite Communication Corporation” which would be privately owned and managed, and which would develop and operate a communications satellite system.
•	Stars may devote % of their lifetime energy to production of neu-
trinos, according to Dr. Hongyee Cinu of Yale and nasa’s Institute for Space Studies, speaking before the American Physical Society in New York. Neutrinos are among the most elusive of atomic particles, having no weight and no electrical charge, passing through matter with little chance of being stopped and with minimum interaction. Dr. Chiu theorized that the universe may have once been made up entirely of neutrinos which interacted to produce other particles and elements and that eventually the universe may return to neutrinos.
•	The 140-ft. radiotelescope under construction at Green Bank,
W. Va., would not be completed until 1963 and its original cost of $6 million would rise to $13 million, the National Science Foundation reported. Cause of most of the delay and added cost was said to be the danger of brittle fracture in the steel used to construct the antenna, which required that the fabricated parts be scrapped and new parts made.
•	Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory at Fort Mon-
mouth announced development of a super-powered laser with a peak power of more than 3 million watts. The laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) is 300 times as powerful as lasers in general laboratory use. It has potential in the fields of communications, range-finding, space vehicle guidance and special-purpose illumination.

10 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
January 26: ranger iii was launched from amr; excessive acceleration by the Atlas lst-stage booster caused the 727-lb. payload to pass 22,862 miles in front of the moon on January 28 instead of impacting as had been planned. Failure of a high-gain antenna to home on the earth rendered signals too weak to provide usable television photographs from the ones ranger took of the moon as it passed it. ranger iii went into orbit around the sun. The flight proved out many of the systems within the payload, including the mid-flight guidance mechanism.
•	During hearings of the Joint Senate and House Economic Com-
mittee, Senator Paul H. Douglas stated that “the public has never really had a chance to consider” the space program and that one third of the members of the American Astronautical Society had indicated in a poll that “a man landing on the moon was not desirable.” Budget Director David E. Bell stoutly defended the space program. Senator Sparkman questioned Senator Douglas: “I wonder whether Congress felt the same way when it put up money for Samuel Morse” to develop the telegraph.
January 27: With the countdown at T —29 minutes, nasa postponed the first U.S. manned orbital flight until February 1 because of cloud cover at the launching site that would have precluded adequate tracking of the vital first minutes of the flight. Astronaut John H. Glenn had been in the Mercury capsule atop the Atlas launch rocket for more than 5 hours when the launch was postponed.
January 29: nasa announced selection of three firms to submit final proposals on the design and development of the Rift (Reactor-In-Flight-Test) rocket stage that would flight-test the Nerva nuclear rocket engine. The firms were General Dynamics/ Astronautics, Lockheed Missile and Space Company, and Martin Marietta Corp. When selected, the contractor would be responsible for designing the Rift stage, fabricating and assembling it at the Michoud Operations Plant, and conducting tests and checkouts related to eventual flight test. The three firms were selected from five who submitted initial bids on January 3, following a first-phase preproposals conference at Marshall Space Flight Center on December 7 attended by 33 firms.
•	The last test model of the usaf Titan I icbm was successfully fired
from amr. It was the 47th Titan I launching from Cape Canaveral, of which 34 were successes, 9 partial successes, and 4 failures.
January 30: nasa announced at Cape Canaveral that manned MA-6 launch would be postponed until February 13 because of “technical difficulties with the launching booster.” John A. Powers, nasa press spokesman, quoted Astronaut John Glenn as saying: “Sure, I’m disappointed, but this is a complicated business. I don’t think we should fly until all elements of the mission are ready. When we have completed all our tests satisfactorily then we’ll go.”
•	nasa announced that Cdr. Forrest S. Petersen (usn), one of six
research pilots assigned to the X-15 flight project, returned to Navy duty after 3}£ years with the X-15.

•	Rep. James G. Fulton, senior Republican on the House Committee
on Science and Astronautics, said in an interview: “There’s no doubt our overall space program is slipping despite the high words and fine praise coming from the White House ... If it continues to slip, we’ll be lucky to get a man on the moon before 198°.” _ ...
•	Reported from Cairo, Egypt, that Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin has said
that the United States “eventually” would orbit a man around the earth.
February 8: Interviewed at home, Astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr., said that scheduled MA-6 launch on February 13 “can only bode for success.” Surveying the crowd of newsmen on his lawn, Colonel Glenn remarked that “it looks like Hangar-S was not such a bad place after all.”
February a(; Hindu astrologers predicted disaster during the period February 4-5 when five planets, the sun. the moon, and an invisible body called Khentu moved into rough alignment. Predictions of disaster were based on astrological tables. Reaction was so widespread that it prompted Prime Minister Nehru to ridicule the predictions in an address: “I do not know the secrets of nature. We will know them gradually. But what we don’t know, we should not accept blindly. At least what strikes our intelligence as completely absurd should not be accepted.”

February 5: nasa submitted to the Congress a draft nasa authorization for FY 1963 bill. It would provide legislative authority to support the nasa budget for FY 1963, and authorize nasa to spend $2,968,278,000 for research, development, and operations and $818,998,000 for construction of facilities.
•	Results of Aviation Week poll of the members of the House of
Representatives to secure “grass-roots” opinions on the U.S. space program were published. Representatives were asked to indicate how their constituents felt about key space aspects. The majority indicated that the U.S. space program is “proceeding at the right pace”; of the minority who disagreed with this, twice as many favored “speeding up the program.” Landing a man on the moon was considered “something the U.S. must do primarily to keep up with the Russians.” The majority also felt that nasa rather than the military should run the space program (“emphatic support for nasa on this question by a ratio of almost 5 to 1”). Rep. Emilio Q. Daddario noted, on his questionnaire that it is regrettable tnat the space program is linked in the public mind to the cold war contest with Russia: “I am concerned by this because the space program does not therefore stand on its own and there is the resulting danger that it will not receive the continuous support it will need over the years ahead to do what must be done . . .”
•	In Voice of America broadcast, Dr. Herbert Friedman, Supt. of
Atmosphere and Astrophysics Division of nrl, reported that the mechanism involved in solar flares may contain the secrets of controlled production of thermonuclear power.

The President declared that the creation of a satellite communication system would be “a measure of immense long-range importance.”
14 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
February 7: In regular press conference, President Kennedy was asked for liis “evaluation of our progress in space at this time” and whether the U.S. had changed its “timetable for landing a man on the moon?” He replied: “I have said from the beginning we’ve been behind. And we are running into the difficulties which come from starting late. We, however, are going to proceed. We’re making a maximum effort, as you know, and the expenditures in our space program are enormous. And, to the best of my ability, the time schedule, I hope, has not been changed by the recent setbacks.”

February 14: MA-6 launch postponed because of bad weather in recovery areas. At regular press conference, President Kennedy was asked about the eighth postponement of “Col. Glenn’s flight.” He replied as follows: “Well, it is unfortunate. I know it strains Colonel Glenn. It has delayed our program. It puts burdens on all those who must take these decisions as to whether the mission should go or not.
“I think it’s Deen very unfortunate. But, I have taken the position that their—the judgment of those on the spot should be
16 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 19 62
final in regard to this mission and I’ll continue to take that judgment.
“I think they would be reluctant to have it cancelled for another three or four months because it would slow our whole space program down at a time when we’re making a concentrated effort in space.
“But I’m quite aware of the strain it caused everyone and it’s been a source of regret to everyone and—but I think we ought to stick with the present group who are making the judgment and they are hopeful still of having this flight take place in the next few days.
“And I’m going to follow their judgment in the matter even though we’ve had bad luck.”

February 20 was announced as the earliest possible launch date. Notified of the decision at 12:50 AM, Astronaut Glenn said: “I guess it was to be expected. We all knew the weather was marginal.”
•	Dr. Robert C. Seamans, nasa Associate Administrator, outlined
nasa’s views of solid-propellant Nova-class motors in a letter to John H. Rubel, Deputy Director, Defense Research and Engineering:
“nasa has a strong interest in the technology of solid-propellant rockets and hopes to make use of them in nasa vehicles when the appropriate feasibility is demonstrated . . .” nasa interest was expressed for motors with thrust levels of “about 2.5 million and 5 million lbs. and burning times of approximately 115 seconds.”
“The higher thrust level produced by motors about 240 inches in diameter by about 100 feet long is especially attractive from a long-range, payload growth viewpoint. In addition, the greater thrust and impulse per motor results in designs with fewer motors per stage, and thus with greater potential for reliability. . . .”

Bureau of Standards’ Central Radio Propagation Laboratory, reviewed the “new dimension to research in ionospheric science” added by space vehicles. He pointed out that “scientific expeditions landing on the surface of Mars or Venus, whether manned or unmanned, will have to communicate by radio with terrestrial headquarters. We must know which frequencies will get through the planetary ionosphere, and which can be used with the radiomirror effect to talk from one part of the planet to another. So far we have had only [the earth’s] ionosphere to study, but this is like the doctor with only a single case. To understand a disease he needs many cases.”
•	The Air Force Space Plan, a ten-year blue-print for military space
technology, was given to a House committee by Lt. Gen. James Ferguson, dcs/r&t. The Space Plan foresaw a military need for

February 20: Mercury spacecraft (Capsule 13), friendship 7, was launched into orbit by Atlas booster (109D), Lt. Col. John H. Glenn, Jr., (usmc), as astronaut. After three orbits (apogee: 162.5 mi.; perigee: 98.9 mi.), friendship 7 re-entered and parachuted into Atlantic some 166 miles east of Grand Turk Island in the Bahamas. Picked up by the destroyer Noa, Glenn remained inside capsule until on deck. Beyond being the first
U.S. manned orbital space flight, MA-6 flight of friendship 7 provided aerospace medical data during 285 minutes of weightlessness, including consumption of solid and liquid food and disorientation exercises. Astronaut Glenn was forced to “fly by wire” (i.e., pilot the spacecraft) during 2nd and 3rd orbits due to troubles with the automatic pilot. Glenn was pronounced “hale and hearty” after his 81,000-mile flight of 4 hrs. 56 min.
•	President Kennedy made a statement to the press on the lawn of
the White House, expressing the “great happiness and thanksgiving of all of us that Col. Glenn has completed his trip ....
“I also want to say a word for all those who participated with Col. Glenn in Canaveral. They have faced many disappointments and delays—the burdens upon them were great—but they kept their heads and made a judgment and I think their judgment has been vindicated.
“We have a long way to go in this space race. We started late. But this is the new ocean, and I believe the United States must sail on it and be in a position second to none.
“Some months ago I said that I hoped every American would serve his country. Today Col. Glenn served his, and we all express our thanks to him.”
•	Estimated that over 60 million Americans witnessed the launch of
friendship 7 on live TV. Voice of America carried live overseas radio coverage. The U.S. Senate recessed at 2:30 PM est just before the landing of Mercury spacecraft. The U.S. Post Office placed Project Mercury postage stamp on sale minutes after Astronaut Glenn stepped on the deck of Noa.
February 21: At regular press conference, President Kennedy opened with a statement on space, saying:
“It is increasingly clear that the impact of Col. Glenn’s magnificent achievement yesterday goes far beyond our own times and our own country. The success of this flight, the new knowledge it will give us, and the new steps which can now be undertaken will affect life on this planet for many years to come.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	19
“This country has received more than 30 messages of congratulations from other heads of state all over the world .... I want to express my thanks to them and at the same time pay tribute to the international cooperation entailed in the successful operation of the Mercury tracking network ....
“. . . Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Union [suggested] . . . that it would be beneficial to the advance of science of our countries if our countries could work together in the exploration of space. I am replying to his message today ....
“We believe that when men reach beyond this planet they should leave their national differences behind them ....
“It has been said that peace has her victories as well as war, and I think all of us can take pride and satisfaction in this history of technology and the human spirit.”
February 21: Mercury officials debriefing Astronaut John Glenn at Giand Turk Island announced that he was in “excellent physical condition.” Dr. Robert B. Voas, psychologist and training officer, said that it was “quite significant” that Glenn had been unable to detect any ill effects during almost five hours of weightlessness. Voas pointed out that longer flights such as the 17 orbits of Cosmonaut Titov are required to document the physical effects of prolonged weightlessness.
•	In formal response to congratulatory note from Premier Khrushchev
on the flight of friendship 7, President Kennedy said: “. . . I welcome your statement that our countries should cooperate in the exploration of space. . . . We of course believe also in strong support of the United Nations in this field and are cooperating directly with many other countries individually.
“I am instructing the appropriate officers of this Government to prepare new and concrete proposals for immediate projects of common action, and I hope at a very early date our representatives may meet to discuss our ideas and: yours in a spirit of practical cooperation.”

Observatory (Oso) containing 13 experiments, within a week.
•	D. Brainerd Holmes, Director of nasa’s Office of Manned Space
Flight, addressed the Engineers, Scientists, and Architects Day meetmg, in which he said: “as a stimulus to our fervent interest in rocketry have been the realities of life in a world which is divided into two armed camps, one of which has the avowed intention of imposing its own way of life on free peoples everywhere. We are, in short, compelled to achieve and maintain leadership in space research and technology because our own fate as a free nation and, in fact, the fate of human civilization as we know it, will depend upon whether the spacecraft of the future are devoted to peaceful purposes or to the destruction of the human race . . .”
•	Thomas F. Dixon, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator, in a
speech on the Apollo Program at San Jose, California, outlined nasa’s progression of flight programs leading to goal of a manned lunar mission before 1970, relating the X-15, Ranger, Surveyor, Mercury, Gemini, and rocket propulsion developments to the Apollo program.

that carried Project Mercury, the U.S. initial manned space flight program, from its inception to the successful accomplishment of man’s flight in orbit about the earth ...”
Lt. Col. John H. Glenn also was awarded the nasa Distinguished Service Medal by the President, the citation to which said:“ . . . made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of human knowledge of space technology and a demonstration of man’s capabilities in space flight. His performance was marked by his great professional skill, his skill as a test pilot, his unflinching courage. . . .”
In his remarks, Astronaut Glenn thanked fellow astronauts and the entire Mercury organization: “we all acted literally and figuratively as a team. ... It goes across the board . . . sort of a crosscut of Americana, of industry, and military and civil service. . . . It was headed up by nasa, of course, but thousands and thousands of people have contributed as certainly much or more than I have to the project. . . .”
February 23: In later nasa press conference at Cape Canaveral, Astronaut John Glenn described his three-orbit flight. He related his observation, his pilotage during almost two orbits, and his concern when burning fragments of the retrorocket package during re-entry appeared to indicate to him that the heat shield was breaking up. He referred to “weightlessness” as a “very pleasant” sensation to which he is becoming “addicted.” Administrator Webb and Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center, Robert Gilruth, spoke briefly. This conference, like all events associated with the MA-6 flight, was fully covered in all detail by the entire American press, radio, and TV.
•	12 European nations agreed on draft convention for the creation
of a European Space Research Organization.

•	dod and nasa signed an agreement that neither agency would
begin the development of a launch vehicle or a space booster without the written acknowledgment of the other.
•	Senator Henry M. Jackson in a radio interview said there was
evidence that “lives were lost” in the Russian manned space flight program. He urged the Kennedy Administration to challenge the U.S.S.R. to “lay bare” its trials and errors in achieving manned space flight.
•	Drew Pearson repeated rumors previously published in his column
that 5 Soviet cosmonauts may have been killed in manned space flight attempts.

February 24: Robert B. Leighton of Cal Tech reported on first direct detection of elastic waves 40 to 50 miles high that carry heat from the sun to its corona. Photographs made through Mount Wilson Observatory detected the energy transfer mechanism of waves which rose and fell at the rate of 1,000 mph and in five-minute periods.
•	Department of Defense Directive (No. 5030.18) issued which
specified responsibilities and procedures for the support of nasa “in order to employ effectively the Nation’s total resources for the achievement of common civil and military space objectives.” It assigned responsibilities within dod to cover existing dod-nasa Agreements on program content, funding, scheduling, and assignment of respective responsibilities.
•	Studies conducted by American Airlines revealed that 78% of
Americans have never traveled on commercial airliner, while 8 million use the airlines regularly (15% of these accounting for 64% of commercial air passengers).
February 25: Soviet scientists claimed to have discovered the third radiation belt around the earth and published such findings two years before the findings of explorer xii were made public by nasa on January 19, 1962. Academician Blagonravov, Vice President of the International Committee on Space Research, said in an Izvestia interview that the existence of a dense belt with energies of 200 to 20,000 electron volts at a distance of
25.000	to 50,000 miles was recorded by Soviet space launchings in 1958. Such findings, he said, were published by Dr. K. Gringauz and associates in the February and April issues of the Soviet Academy oj Sciences Proceedings in 1960, and in later publications. Commenting on the view that the three radiation belts really formed a single large pulsating band that might be called a “magnetosphere,” Blagonravov agreed that the boundaries might be arbitrary but that the charged particles in each belt had distinctive characteristics and that it would be “inexpedient” to reject the theory of three belts.
February 26: John Glenn Day in Washington, D.C. An estimated
250.000	persons lined the rain-drenched parade route from the White House to Capitol Hill. In 20-minute address to the joint session of the Congress, Astronaut Glenn paid tribute to the Project Mercury team and pointed to the unbounded future of space exploration:
“. . . I feel that we are on the brink of an area of expansion of knowledge about ourselves and our surroundings that is beyond description or comprehension at this time.
“Our efforts today and what we’ve done so far are but small building blocks on a very high pyramid to come . . .
“We’re just probing the surface of the greatest advancement in man’s knowledge of his surroundings that has ever been made . . . There are benefits to science across the board. Any major effort such as this results in research by so many different specialties that it’s hard to even envision the benefits that will accrue in many fields.
“Knowledge begets knowledge. The more I see, the more impressed I am not with how much we know but with how tremendous the areas are that are yet unexplored . . .”
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	23
February 26: In nas lecture for Voice of America broadcast, Dr. Joseph W. Chamberlain of the University of Chicago’s Yerkes Observatory predicted that space-age research techniques may soon provide final answers to questions about the aurora that have eluded scientists for centuries. "Better understanding of physical processes producing the aurora,” he said, “should allow the spec-troscopist to derive even more information from his observations of the auroral spectrum about the physics and chemical processes in the high atmosphere.” He suggested that space probes may detect auroras on other planets which will provide an entire new set of data different from terrestrial phenomena with which to test hypotheses for auroral bombardment mechanisms.
•	Technical difficulties with third stage of Thor-Delta booster post-
poned launching of Oso satellite at amb.
•	Senators Estes Kefauver and Wayne Morse proposed legislation
calling for a government-owned corporation to operate space satellite communications network.

a news conference that the U.S.S.R. would cooperate with the U.S. and other member nations of the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space meeting on March 19. Zorin said that he hoped that the committee would be able to agree on a work program for “mutually beneficial and advantageous cooperation.”
February 27: nasa Administrator Webb introduced Robert R. Gilruth and Astronauts Shepard, Grissom, and Glenn to nasa Headquarters’ personnel assembled in fob No. 6, Washington.
•	House Committee on Science and Astronautics began hearings on
$3.7-billion nasa authorization request. Administrator Webb, Robert R. Gilruth (Director msc), and Astronauts Glenn, Grissom, and Shepard appeared as witnesses.
Mr. Webb outlined nasa’s projected program to be covered in detail in subsequent testimony: (1) total ten year program ahead may cost over $35 billion; (2) new astronaut training program to include scientists will be announced shortly; (3) future manned spacecraft will be capable of landing on land or water; (4) nasa is opposed to using astronauts as goodwill ambassadors, as they are needed on the current program; (5) 92% of nasa’s budget will be spent through industry and universities.
Astronaut Glenn pointed out that the Nation “must be prepared” for failures in future manned space flights. “We don’t envision every flight,” he said, “coming back as successfully as the three we have had so far ... I hope we will always have the confidence in the program that we now have despite the fact there will be times when we are not riding a crest of happiness and enthusiasm as we now are.”
•	nasa witnesses appeared before the Senate Committee on Aero-
nautical and Space Sciences hearings on communication satellites system. Deputy nasa Administrator Dryden stated that the U.S. would nave operational satellite communications within five years.

February 27: Second Saturn flight vehicle (SA-2) arrived at Cape Canaveral aboard the barge Promise.
•	In testimony before closed session of the House Appropriations
Committee, Prof. James A. Van Allen stated that man-in-space programs were not necessary for scientific space exploration. “For the same investment of effort we learn much more without the man. ... A monkey made the first orbital trip and he made out alright.” In testifying on behalf of the National Science Foundation appropriation, Van Allen said that the U.S. should not rush into a cooperative space program with Russia; failures would worsen relations since Russia has more to gain from such a program. The U.S., he said, had surpassed Russia “in nearly all areas of purely scientific investigation of outer space” but some American scientists have “an uneasy, creeping feeling that Russia is about to launch a manned flight around the moon.” Testimony was released on May 14.
•	usaf witnesses before the Senate Military Appropriations Sub-
committee testified under questioning that dod budget was not adequate in all areas. Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, usaf Chief of Staff, said that funds should be provided for “at least 100 more Minuteman icbm’s” than in present budget, and that he favored a “little more emphasis” in the military space program on early-warning systems. Secretary Eugene Zuckert indicated that he favored development of the RS-70 as a full-fledged weapon system.
•	Dr. Nancy Roman, Chief of Astronomy and Solar Physics in nasa’s
Office of Space Sciences, was one of six receiving the Federal Women’s Award.
February 28: Mercury astronauts Shepard, Grissom, and Glenn appeared before both the House Science and Astronautics Committee and the Senate Aeronautics and Space Committee, answering a variety of questions on future manned space flight.

Sanderson succeeded Frank Smith of nasa’s Langley Research Center.
•	Pilot course in the practical engineering aspects of space satellites
began at Texas a&m College under an agreement with nasa.
•	Major problem under study by Air Force Cambridge Research
Laboratories’ Sacramento Peak Observatory was the prediction of safe intervals for manned space flight. Since March 1961, intensive study has been made of proton showers originating from solar flares and arriving at the earth from 30 minutes to 6 hours after the flare has peaked. One major flare out of every four produces proton showers winch follow the 11-year cycle of activity. Sunspot maximum occurred in 1957-1958 and the minimum is expected in 1964-1965.
•	Army announced establishment of Space Construction Office in the
Office of the Chief of Engineers to coordinate all activities carried out for nasa, to be headed fly Brig. Gen. T. J. Hayes, III.
•	Dr. Mia G. Masevich, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Astronomical
Council, published first serious mention of echo i in a leading non-technical Russian magazine (Ogonyok). Virtually nothing has been said about echo i in the Soviet press since its launch in August 1960, although it has remained in orbit longer than any Soviet satellite and was visible to Soviet citizens.
•	Draft convention presented to Australia covering joint use of the
Woomera Rocket Range by space research program of the western European nations.

26 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
During February: Astronaut John Glenn’s orbital space flight produced a great propaganda dividend for the United States, Mr. Edward It. Murrow, Director of the United States Information Agency, said. “The contrast was immediately drawn around the world between the openness, the complete coverage of the flight, compared to the Russian efforts in this area . . . More newspapers normally hostile to the United States had to admit not only the scientific achievement but the fact that we were prepared to let our own people and the rest of the world see the entire operation from beginning to end.”
MARCH 1962
March 1: John Glenn Day in New York City. An estimated four million people lined the streets to cheer the Mercury astronauts. Mayor Robert Wagner presented the city’s highest award, the Medal of Honor, to Col. Glenn and Robert R. Gilruth.
•	Third successful static-test firing of “Old Salty”—an H-l engine
that had been submerged in salt water for four hours before each of its test runs. Purpose of tests was to determine feasibility and costs of recovering, rebuilding, and reusing booster engines as opposed to cost of new engines. Early results indicated that engines could be recovered and rebuilt at a cost of about 10% of new engines.
•	nasa fired a Scout rocket from Wallops Station, Ya. The rocket
flew 135 miles high and about 800 miles downrange in a re-entry test reaching speeds of 19,000 mph.
•	Rift (Reactor-in-Flight-Test) bidders conference held at Marshall
Space Flight Center.
•	Morton J. Stoller was named Director of the Office of Applications
in nasa Hq., a post he had held in an acting capacity since January 1962. He was made Deputy Director in November 1961.
•	Reported in the press that a 3-ft. by 2-ft. metal fragment found on a
farm in South Africa on February 21 was identified by numbers stamped on it as a part of the Atlas booster that placed Astronaut John Glenn into orbit on February 20. Local reports of an explosion about 1 AM on February 21 indicated that the fragment came to earth after about 8 hours in orbit. Fragment was reported as 4 ft. by 2-ft. “stainless steel” in Capetown telegram to nasa Feb. 26, 1962.
•	nasa selected Chance-Vought Corp. as contractor to study rendez-
vous of space vehicles. A primary part of the contract would be a flight simulation study exploring the capability of an astronaut to control an Apollo-type spacecraft.
•	American Airlines 707 jet transport crashed in Jamaica Bay, N.Y..
seconds after takeoff from New York International Airport, and all 95 persons on board were killed, the highest toll in U.S. history in the crash of a single airplane. The crash occurred about one hour before the start of the giant parade in honor of Lt. Col. John H. Glenn, Jr.
March 2: Mercury astronauts visited the United Nations, and John Glenn, during an informal reception given by Acting Secretary-General U Thant, said: “To be here at the United Nations this morning and have all these tributes to our project and all the people that are working on it from people of this calibre, is indeed overwhelming all over again after yesterday. . . .
“As space science and space technology grows still further and our projects become more and more ambitious, we will be relying more and more on international teamwork.

“And the natural center for this teamwork is the United Nations . . . Colonel Glenn also expressed the gratitude of Project Mercury to those countries who had cooperated in the flight operations.
March 2: In Nation-wide radio-TY address, President Kennedy announced that the U.S. would begin atmospheric nuclear tests from Johnston and Christmas Islands in the Pacific during April unless such tests were rendered unnecessary by the clear willingness of the U.S.S.R. to take mutual steps toward “general and complete disarmament.”
•	Five Nike-Cajun rockets were fired from Wallops Station, Va.,
in a series of tests to measure atmospheric conditions at high altitudes. At 5:47 AM nasa scientists fired the first rocket to spread a trail of water vapor up to 89 miles altitude. At 5:54 AM the second rocket was fired. It loosed a cloud of sodium vapor starting at 26 miles and rising with the rocket to 84 miles. The cloud was spectacular in the sunrise and visible for hundreds of miles along the Atlantic coast. At 6:15 AM the third rocket jettisoned and detonated grenades one at a time at altitudes from 24 to 55 miles. Two additional Nike-Cajun rockets were fired in the evening with sodium and grenade experiments.
•	usaf reported that “an Air Force satellite had provided the first
continuous data on the actual size and intensity of the inner belt” of proton radiation over the Equator at altitudes of 600 to 3,000 miles. Stating only that the data was acquired from a 23-lb. experiment aboard an Agena, the report said radiation intensity at the center of the belt was 600,000 proton particles passing through one sq. inch per second, previously estimated at 100,000.
•	A simple satellite plotter costing only a few hundred dollars and
accurate to within 10 miles on any orbit was devised by Major William Gamble of the Canadian Defence Research Board. The Defence Research Board would use the device to give quick fixes on satellite orbits to radar stations.
March 3: Astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr., was welcomed in his home town of New Concord, Ohio, by a crowd estimated at 50,000 people (normal population of New Concord, 2,127).
•	Capsule from discoverer xxxviii recovered in midair over the
Pacific by a usaf C-130 piloted by Capt. Jack R. Wilson. It was his second recovery, the 8th midair recovery, and the 12th recovery air or sea during the Discoverer series. The capsule had been in polar orbit 4 days since its launch on February 27.
•	nasa selected Sverdrup and Parcel of St. Louis as contractor for the
design criteria and initial master planning for the Mississippi Test Facility, the 13,500-acre site that would eventually contain 6 or more static test stands for testing booster stages of Saturn and Nova vehicles.
•	U.S. navy filed claims with Federation Aeronautique Internationale
for new time-to-climb records for the McDonnell F4H Phantom II fighter (which is also slated for usaf service as the F-110), superseding records held by the usaf’s F-104 since 1958 and apparently bettering new usaf claims for the same marks based on flights made by the T-38 Talon trainer on Feb. 19, 1962. The Phantom claims: 3,000 meters: 34.523 sec, LCdr. J. W. Young (usn); 6,000 meters: 48.787 sec, Cdr. D. M. Longton

March 4' usaf’s first balloon launching in Project Stargazer ended when the large helium balloon exploded at 42,000 feet two hours after launch. It dropped its gondola loaded with telescopic camera equipment into deep Sierra Mountain snow. Launched from Chico, Calif., the balloon was to have ascended to the upper atmosphere where its telescopic cameras would have photographed the stars and planets free from the filtering action of the atmosphere.
March 5: usaf B-58 Hustler bomber claimed 3 transcontinental speed records after a Los Angeles-to-New York-to-Los Angeles nonstop flight: round trip, 4 hrs. 42 min. 12 sec.; west-to-east, 2 hrs. 1 min. 39 sec.; east-to-west, 2 hrs. 15 min. 12 sec. Flying most of the way at 50,000 ft. and at an average speed of 1,044.3 mph, the B-58 trailed a 40-mile-wide sonic boom along the ground in its wake. Crew was: Capt. Robert Sowers, pilot; Capt. Robert MacDonald, navigator; and Capt. John Walton, defense systems operator.
•	U.S. reported to the United Nations that a total of 72 U.S. space
vehicles and associated objects were in orbit around the earth as of February 15.
•	Department of Defense has issued a directive providing for closer
and more effective cooperation between dod and nasa, dod’s Deputy Director of Research and Engineering John H. Rubel told the Senate Aeronautical and Space Committee. The directive gave the usaf authority to work with nasa on all levels for purposes of coordinating efforts and exchanging technical information but reserved to dod the responsibility for establishing new programs and assigning military support to nasa.
•	Tiros weather satellites have been of major assistance in improving
forecasts for airline operations. Mr. Silvio Simplicio, supervising forecaster at New York International Airport, said: “We can do a job nowadays we never thought we could do years ago . . . With the aid of the Tiros satellites we never had it so good, and with the Nimbus meteorological satellite now undergoing tests, we expect even better results.”
•	nasa selected American Telephone and Telegraph Co. as contractor
for system engineering support for the manned space flight program. It was estimated that some 200 specialists would be available under the contract for quick fact-finding in regard to critical decisions on the complex program.
•	Caledonian Airlines DC-7 with 111 persons aboard crashed near
Douala, Cameroon, the worst single aircraft disaster in civil aviation history.
March 5-7: nasa Wallops Station, Va., suffered storm damage first estimated in excess of $1 million as a result of high seas accompanying series of severe storms. Facilities of the main base on Wallops Island unused by nasa were subsequently opened to house evacuees from Chincoteague and surrounding areas.
30 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
March 6: Each of the series of weather satellites, Tiros, Nimbus, and Aeros, would not only provide an advance in capability but would extend observations into vital new areas, Morton J. Stoller, nasa’s Director of Applications, testified before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Speaking of Nimbus and Aeros, he said: “With one Nimbus in orbit, about half a day passes before we again see the same area. This will be a reasonably satisfactory time for the observation of such systems as cyclonic storms and hurricanes whose normal life is considerably greater than 12 hours. But, if we attempt to observe thunderstorm cells or tornadoes, systems whose life is appreciably less than 12 hours and often less than 6 hours will usually form, move and die without ever being detected. It is for this reason that the Aeros satellite with its capability for focusing on small short-lived storm systems and tracking them continuously, is considered to be an integral component of the eventual operational system.”
•	Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert, speaking before the
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, cited Dr. Hugh L. Dryden’s summation of the purposes of the national space program—“(1) insurance of the nation against scientific obsolescence in a time of explosive advances in science and technology; and (2) insurance against the hazards of military surprise in space.” The Secretary added: “He defined in these two purposes the peacetime role of nasa in the national space program, and the defense role of the Air Force. The two must advance in harness, and they do. They are interdependent. One cannot move without the other. Furthermore, the nation cannot stand for any diversion of the efforts of either toward jurisdictional conflicts which which can rob us of the most precious ingredient—time.”
•	Dr. Arthur E. Raymond was appointed a special consultant to the
nasa Administrator. He would be concerned with organization and management of research and development programs, especially those involving advanced research and over-all systems planning. Dr. Raymond retired in 1960 as senior vice president of engineering for Douglas Aircraft Co., having spent 35 years with the company. He served as a member of naca from 19461956.
•	aec selected the Martin-Marietta Corp. as contractor to design,
build, and ground test Snap 11, the thermoelectric nuclear generator for use on nasa’s Surveyor spacecraft. Snap 11 would weigh about 30 lbs., including shielding, and would provide a minimum of 18.6 watts of power continuously for 90-day lunar missions.
•	Army fired a Nike-Zeus antimissile missile from Kwajalein Island
and successfully intercepted an electronically simulated icbm warhead.
March 7: oso i (Orbiting Solar Observatory) was successfully launched into orbit from Cape Canaveral, marking the seventh straight success for the Thor-Delta booster. The 458-lb. satellite, with an apogee of 370 mi. and a perigee of 340 mi., immediately began sending back signals on the sun’s radiation in the ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma ray regions from its position above the filtering action of the earth’s atmosphere. By an intricate position-
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	31
ing apparatus, oso’s 13 instruments were focused constantly on the sun with a pointing accuracy of 1 minute of arc. This was the first of a series of Osos to be launched by nasa in the next 11-year sun cycle.
March 7: nasa established the nasa Launch Operations Center at Cape Canaveral, with Dr. Kurt H. Debus as Director. Reporting to the Director of Manned Space Flight at nasa Hq., the new Center would serve all nasa projects launched from Cape Canaveral, absorbing Marshall Space Flight Center’s Launch Operations Directorate. Similarly at Point Mugu, Calif., the nasa Test Support Office was redesignated the nasa Pacific Launch Operations Office, with Cdr. Simon J. Burttschell as Acting Director.
•	D. Brainerd Holmes, nasa’s Director of Manned Space Flight,
testified before a subcommittee of the House Science and Astronautics Committee on the very large and complex manned space flight program. The most important step in space capability in 1961, he said, “was not that of awarding particular contracts or making technical decisions, but rather Mr. Webb’s carefully planned reorganization of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.” Speaking of future launch sites for the Advanced Saturn vehicle as the workhorse of the manned lunar program, he said: “. . . it shows our plans for an entirely new concept of launching our large space vehicles. Instead of literally assembling or building the launch vehicles on the pads as we do at present, this arrangement would permit assembly and test at a location remote from the launch pads and under cover, protected from weather. It will be possible to have vertical transfer of the entirely assembled vehicle to the launch pad in a tested condition. This arrangement should offer many advantages in order to permit better and more thorough checkout, and to assure more rapid launching and efficient utilization of each pad. For the extremely tight schedules that will be required for launch operations in support of orbital rendezvous, this rapid launch capability is highly desirable.”
•	Escape-velocity payloads with the nuclear-engine Rift as the 3rd
stage on an Advanced Saturn booster would be more than double that of a 3-stage, all-chemical Advanced Saturn and higher than that of the Nova 12-million-pound-thrust vehicle, according to testimony given to a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics by Harold B. Finger, nasa’s Director of Nuclear Systems.
•	Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa’s Director of Space Sciences, testifying
before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science ana Astronautics, said: “Because of this great breadth and scope of space science, and because of the many basic scientific problems that it encompasses, our country must have a sound and vigorous space science program if we intend to maintain our position of leadership in world science . . .
“The space science of today is needed to sow the seeds for the harvest of future applications of space knowledge and technology. The weather, communications, and navigation satellites of today grew out of the scientific engineering and research of the past decades. Their perfection, and the development of new
32 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
applications, will rest upon the space science and engineering of today and the years to come.”
March 7: usaf launched an unidentified satellite with an Atlas-Agena B from Point Arguello, Calif.
March 8: John L. Sloop, nasa’s Director of Propulsion and Power Generation, testifying before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said: “. . . some of the new solid propellants promise an increase in performance of over 18 percent. ... If applied to our new Surveyor spacecraft designed to land instruments on the moon, this 18 percent increase in solid propellant specific impulse could make possible an increase in the weight of instruments aboard by more than 50 percent.”
•	Tracking network that operated during Glenn orbital flight would
for the most part be sufficient to handle the 18-orbit flights to follow, according to Edmond C. Buckley, nasa’s Director of Tracking and Data Acquisition, in testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. For the Glenn flight, the ground stations had to provide five minutes of contact and communication for every 15 minutes of flight during the 4K-hour mission. For 18 orbits the current requirement was one contact per orbit. This would require repositioning of the two ship stations and adding more telemetryreceiving equipment and command systems to some of the existing sites.
•	Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., nasa Associate Administrator, speak-
ing before the ias National Propulsion Meeting in Cleveland, said: “As we move on toward the moon, with Saturn, Advanced Saturn, and Nova as our launch vehicles, the reliability problem takes on a new dimension.
“These big space vehicles will be the first developed especially for manned space exploration. The unit cost will be high. Only a few of each version will be produced. The systems and the missions are extremely complex, involving long periods of operation in space and a return launch from the moon without the help, needless to say, of a lunar Cape Canaveral.”
•	Army launched a 3-stage Nike-Zeus anti-icBM missile in its first
full-missile test from Point Mugu, but the missile was destroyed in midair when it seemed to be going off its planned trajectory.
•	USAF Minuteman icbm fired from a silo at Cape Canaveral and
flew more than 3,000 mi. down the Atlantic Missile Range, the sixth straight success in the underground launchings.
March 9: In a Pentagon ceremony, Lt. Col. John H. Glenn, Jr., was awarded the Navy’s astronaut wings and a new Marine Corps device—a winged rocket superimposed on a globe—that would also be given to all future Marines who orbited the earth in a space capsule.
•	Titan II underwent a successful 20-second full-power captive
firing at Cape Canaveral and was considered ready for its first flight test in about a week. usAF-developed Titan II produced
430.000	lbs. thrust in its 1st stage; the 2nd stage would add another
100.000	lbs. thrust; compared with 400,000 lbs. for the Atlas E and 380,000 for Titan I. Titan II, already selected as booster for nasa’s 2-man Gemini capsule, burns storable fuels that emit a stream of hot, clear gases rather than flame.

March 10: In address at fund-raising dinner at Miami Beach, President Kennedy pointed out that nasa would spend five times as much in Florida during next fiscal year as last, and that “research, development and production expenditures will also increase at the Cape, in this state’s private industry, and in your great universities.”
•	The Astronautics Committee of the 51-nation F4d4ration Aero-
nautique Internationale, meeting in Paris, certified Soviet Cosmonaut Gherman Titov as holder of two new world records for space flight: duration of flight, 25 hrs. 11 min.; and length of flight, 436,911 mi. In certifying Titov’s records, the committee relaxed its rule that the pilot must land with his vehicle (Titov parachuted to earth). The heaviest payload in orbital flight still belongs to the other Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin (10,419 lbs.).
March 11: Second anniversary of the launching of the unsurpassed pioneer v space probe, pioneer v produced first data on the nature of interplanetary space, including solar flare effects in interplanetary space which were compared with earth-orbiting-satellite readings, and sent back telemetry 22.5 million miles from earth on June 26,1960, a communications record unmatched until the flight of mariner ii.
•	Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences an-
nounced that improvements had been made in the second Project West Ford package soon to be launched into orbit: (1) weight had been reduced from 75 to 50 lbs., thus reducing the number of dipoles in the package from 350 million to 250 million; (2) the container had been redesigned to ensure that it would be imparted with the proper spin by the rifle-like barrel from which it is ejected (this caused failure of the first experiment to disperse); (3) vhe beacon and telemetry were included to ensure tracking capability; and (4) a fail-safe device would prevent the capsule from ejecting at any other than the proper orbit. Report sent to International Astronomical Union to assure astronomers that every care was being taken that the filaments not interfere with astronomical observations.
•	nasa announced that echo i, the 100-ft. balloon-type passive com-
munications satellite launched on August 12, 1960, had recently become increasingly difficult for observers to see. The sphere now presented only K to its original size, due either to shrinkage or distortion during its year and a half in orbit.
•	Reported in London that U.S.S.R. has nearly completed negotia-
tions with the United Arab Republic and Iraq for supply of Soviet guided missiles.
March 12: U.S.S.R. had shown a “change in attitude in recent weeks” on cooperating with the U.S. on development and use of a weather satellite system, Dr. Francis W. Reichelderfer, Chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau, testified before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics.
•	Orbital data from satellites have suggested that scientists do not
really know the shape of the earth, Dr. George P. Woollard, Director of the Geophysics and Polar Research Center of the University of Wisconsin, said in a Voice of America broadcast. Such studies have indicated that the earth may have not only
34 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962
the “flattened ‘tomato shape’ that has been assumed since the time of Isaac Newton but also a superimposed ‘pear shape.’ ” Citing the number of forces that can operate on a satellite, thus requiring extremely careful analysis of its data, Dr. Woollard pointed out that the Committee on Geodesy of the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences had recommended the launching of a specially instrumented geodetic-research satellite to resolve some of the questionable areas of influence on magnetic readings.
March 12: U.S. News and World Report carried article on “Red Space Failures,” pointing to official U.S. policy with regard to Soviet launchings: “No Soviet feat [in space] has ever been publicly challenged in Washington and no failure publicly announced.” It reported that while Premier Khrushchev was at the United Nations in September 1960, “a Soviet cosmonaut was sent more than a hundred miles into space and killed”; that in a five-month period in 1960-61, four Soviet space probes were fired toward Mars and Venus, but failed; and that during the same period “a dozen other Soviet space shots went awry . .
March 13: Dr. Abe Silverstein, Director of nasa’s Lewis Research Center, received the National Civil Service League's Career Service Award, one of 10 Government leaders so recognized.
• Sharp rise in heating of re-entry vehicles returning from manned lunar missions at speeds of 25,000 mph was described to the subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics by Milton B. Ames, Jr., Director of Space Vehicle Research and Technology, nasa. Mr. Ames stated that a simulation study at nasa’s Ames Research Center had “demonstrated
Eeat promise for pilot-controlled re-entries during orbital and nar missions, and we plan to extend our work in this area.”
• usaf launched its second Stargazer balloon from Chico, Calif., and achieved an altitude of some 88,000 ft. Balloon performed well in this test preliminary to manned flights that would send two men and a stabilized telescope to 16 miles. The first Stargazer burst at 40,000 ft. on March 4.
March H: nasa’s Director of Aeronautical Research, John Stack, testifying before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, spoke of nasa support of dod missile programs: “Included in this work are such as Pershing, Atlas, Nike, Nike-Zeus, Eagle, gar-9 and Skybolt. The nasa contributions have been in two areas, one providing critical aerodynamic information for performance determination and control system characteristics and the other in suggesting configuration improvements to improve the over-all characteristics.”
• nasa announced that sea damage to Wallops Station, Va., occurring earlier in the month was not extensive, and that rocket firings would be resumed in a few days. Although launch pads and some tracking gear on the island itself had been damaged by water, the more important tracking and data acquisition facilities on the mainland were undamaged.
• explorer ix, launched on February 16, 1961, provided new and refined information on the density of the upper atmosphere, a press conference of nasa and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory scientists reported. They confirmed a figure previously
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1862	35
released—that the density of the atmosphere at 420 mi. was 3 x 10-17 grams per cubic centimeter, or 1/40 million millionth of that at sea level, explorer ix density values were about 10 times lower than those computed in 1959 from earlier satellites. Most of this decrease is attributed to the decrease in solar activity since the peak of the solar cycle in 1958 and 1959. Changes were also clearly related to the 27-day rotational period of the sun and to the occasional violent solar storms that affect the earth’s atmosphere. explorer ix, a 12-ft. aluminum-foil sphere painted with white “polka dots,” was expected to have an orbital life of two more years. As it spiraled down into denser atmosphere, it was expected to provide much more information on density at altitudes down to 100 mi.
March 14: United Nations opened a public register on satellites in orbit. At the time of opening, it contained only the U.S. report submitted on March 5, which reported “72 U.S. space vehicles and associated objects in sustained orbit or space transit” as of February 15, 1962.
•	nasa and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced the selection
of Military Electronics Division of Motorola, Inc., as contractor to manufacture and test radio equipment in the first two phases of a program to augment the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility by providing “S” band capability for stations at Gold-stone, Calif.; Woomera, Australia; and Johannesburg, South Africa. With these stations located some 120° apart around the earth, dsif would have a high-gain, narrow-beam-width, high-frequency system, with very little interference from cosmic noise and would provide much improved telemetering and tracking of satellites as far out as the moon and nearby planets.
•	Walter C. Scott, Chief of nasa’s Space Power Technology Program,
testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said one of the promising developments in solar cells was the possibility of producing thin strips of silicon solar cells on some kind of substrata. If this can be done, the “much lower cost, lower weight and improved mechanical properties will be attractive to the space industry and for that matter to the civilian economy. Thin films of cadmium sulfide have been produced in small areas with conversion efficiencies of 3%. It has been stated that if this efficiency could be increased to 5% and produced in large areas, solar power would be economically competitive with conventional sources at rates of 3 to 4 mils per kilowatt hour.”
•	Navy launched solid-propellant Terrier-Asp IV sounding rocket
from Point Arguello in successful first flight test.
•	Theodore Shabad, Moscow correspondent for the New York Times,
described the Clubs of Young Cosmonauts in U.S.S.K. The Moscow club was organized in January 1962 under joint sponsorship of Moskovsky Komsomolets, newspaper of the Young Communist League, and the cosmonautics section of the Soviet Federation of Aviation Sports. Its purpose was to interest youngsters in space and also to publicize Soviet achievements in space.
•	usaf announced it would extend space surveillance to the moon
through a system developed by the Space Track Kesearch & Development Facility at Laurence G. Hanscom Field, Mass.
36 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
There will be surveillance of orbiting man-made or natural objects beyond the earth’s nominal, low-altitude orbital areas out toward the moon.
March 14-' Six candidates were selected by the usaf for Dyna-Soar, including four Air Force and two nasa test pilots. Dyna-Soar is designed to be boosted into orbit by a Titan III.
March 15: nasa announced that LCdr. M. Scott Carpenter (usn) would be the pilot on the next Mercury orbital space flight (MA-7). Major Donald K. Slayton (usaf), the astronaut originally scheduled for the flight, was disqualified because of an “erratic heart rate,” after the medical findings bad been reviewed by an Air Force medical board and a board of civilian cardiologists. Astronaut Walter M. Scbirra was named as Carpenter’s backup pilot.
•	Editorial in the Royal Aero Club magazine Flight claimed that
because the U.S. had made “six major launches on which basic orbital information had been withheld from world scientists,” the U.S. was practicing “brinksmanship in space.”
•	National Rocket Club announced the establishment of the Dr.
Robert H. Goddard Historical Essay Award, an annual competition in the history of rocketry and astronautics, the first such competition in the field of history.
March 16: usaf Titan II icbm successfully launched on first flight, from Cape Canaveral. Initiated less than 2 years ago, Titan II is powered by storable propellants (430,000-lbs. thrust in 1st stage, 100,000-lbs. in second stage), and will also be used as the boosters for nasa’s Gemini two-man spacecraft.
•	Premier Khrushchev claimed that the U.S.S.R. had a new “invul-
nerable global rocket,” announced the orbiting of cosmos i (the 16th Russian satellite), and stated that the U.S.S.R. would carry out new atmospheric nuclear tests if the U.S. resumes its atmospheric tests. Tass released a news story on the new satellite, giving its orbital data as apogee, 609 mi.; perigee, 135 mi.; period, 96 min.; and inclination, 49° to the equator. A scientific payload included measurements of meteoric impacts, low-energy solar radiation, earth’s radiation belts, cosmic rays, earth’s magnetic field, short-wave radiation from sun and other celestial sources, and atmospheric cloud patterns.
•	First anniversary of the dedication of the Goddard Space Flight
Center, nasa. During that year, seven Goddard satellites were orbited, the Center successfully operated the new 18-station world tracking network for the Glenn flight, began expansion of the 13-station scientific satellite tracking and data network, saw some 70 of its sounding rocket payloads launched from Wallops Station, established the Institute for Space Studies in New York, and added three buildings and 700 persons to the Goddard staff.
•	At Robert H. Goddard Memorial Dinner, Vice President Lyndon
B. Johnson pointed out areas in which international cooperation should begin in outer space. “As we attempt to look 25 years into the future, we catch visions of breathtaking journeys in large man-made planets around the sun to Mars and Venus—of a new freedom of movement of man across millions of miles of space—of a permanent colony on the moon and of large space stations or space forts at key locations for the conduct of space research, for aid to space navigation, and for rescue operations.”
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	37
Major awards of the National Rocket Club were presented: the premier Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy was presented by Mrs. Esther C. Goddard and the Vice President to Robert R. Gilruth, director of Project Mercury; the National Rocket Club Award was given to the New York Times; the Nelson P. Jackson Aerospace Memorial Award was given to the Radio Corp. of America for its design and construction of the Tiros meteorological satellites; and the Astronautics Engineer Award was given to William G. Stroud of nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center for his contribution to the technology of meteorological satellites.
March 17: vanguard i began fifth year in orbit, having traveled 543,195,264 miles ia 15,712 orbits and still transmitting. Its rotation had slowed from three revolutions per second to one revolution in 23 seconds due to dampening effect of the earth’s magnetic field.
•	President Kennedy wrote Premier Khrushchev proposing specific
areas of peaceful cooperation in space to be undertaken by the U.S. and U.S.S.R.: (1) in furtherance of an operational weather satellite system, proposed each country launch a weather satellite in near-polar orbit, disseminate data to all nations; (2) in space tracking, proposed each country build a tracking station in the other’s territory and train personnel of the host country to maintain and operate the station; (3) in mapping the earth’s magnetic field, proposed each country launch a magnetic-measurement satellite, one in near-earth orbit and one farther out, and disseminate data to all nations; (4) in communications satellites, proposed that U.S.S.R. join in cooperative program to establish an operational communications satellite system, to be made available to all nations; (5) in manned space flight, proposed that the two countries pool their knowledge of space medicine; (6) proposed general continued future cooperation, as in joint exploration of the lunar surface or scientific investigation of Mars and Venus. Further proposed that any agreements reached be reported to the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
•	Soviet News Agency Tass reported that cosmos i satellite was
transmitting a steady stream of technical data.
March 19: U.N.’s reorganized 28-nation Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space opened its meetings with the reelection of Dr. Franz Matsch of Austria as chairman and his subsequent ruling that the committee would make decisions by “consensus” rather than by vote. U.S. delegate was Francis T. P. Plimpton; his deputy was Richard N. Gardner, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs. Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of nasa, was Plimpton’s technical adviser. Dr. Homer Newell of nasa and Leonard C. Meeker of the State Department were alternate representatives. Congressional advisers were Senators Howard W. Cannon and Margaret Chase Smith, and Representatives James G. Fulton and George P. Miller. U.S.S.R. representative was Platon D. Morozov. V. Dobronravov, member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and space expert, was his scientific adviser.
•	Space science might provide an answer within five years to the
question of whether gravitation is growing weaker with time,
38 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
Dr. Robert H. Dicke, Professor of Physics at Princeton University’s Palmer Physical Laboratory, said in a lecture for the Voice of America. This new theory of gravitation, not in accord with Einstein’s theory of gravitation, could be tested with a satellite that was instrumented to act as a “gravitational clock” and checked against an atomic clock.
March 20: Premier Khrushchev replied to President’s letter of March 17 proposing U.S.'—U.S.S.R. cooperation on peaceful uses of outer space by accepting in principle and specifically approving of cooperation in certain areas (letter released on March 21): (1) communications satellites; (2) weather satellites; (3) coordination of tracking and data reception on scientific satellites; (4) international search and rescue operations to recover space crews who have returned to earth outside the planned recovery areas; (5) mapping the earth’s magnetic field and exchange of information on space medicine; (6) joint agreement on problems of international law as related to space exploration, beyond those points already agreed to in the U.N., especially the prohibition of space experiments that would inhibit the space experiments of other nations. Premier Khrushchev warned, however, that space cooperation would “depend to some extent on the settlement of the disarmament problem,” since much military hardware and techniques were used in peaceful space exploration vehicles.
•	U.S.S.R. representative to U.N.’s Committee on Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space pledged that U.S.S.R. would cooperate “by deeds” in international programs on space. Promised reports to U.N. on Soviet satellite and rocket launchings, cooperation on communications satellites but on the basis of “international regional agreements.”
•	usaf awarded contract to North American Aviation, Inc., for
development of RS-70 prototypes, including fabrication of three aircraft.
March 21: President Kennedy opened his news conference with the announcement that he had received Premier Khrushchev’s reply to his letter on cooperation in the peaceful uses of space and stated: “I’m gratified that this reply indicates that there are a number of areas of common interest.” He further announced that Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of nasa, had been designated to lead the technical discussions with Soviet representatives beginning in New York on March 27.
•	House of Representatives passed by a vote of 430 to 0 a bill author-
izing $13 billion to dod for procurement of ships, aircraft, and missiles. Included was $491 million for development of the controversial RS-70 but without the previous Congressional language directing dod to use that amount for the RS-70 in FY 1963. Rep. Carl Vinson, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, read letters from the President and Secretary of Defense in which they asserted their Constitutional obligation to make the final determination in such matters but promised, in view of the Committee’s concern over continued bomber development, to re-examine the RS-70 program.
•	House Science and Astronautics Committee’s Panel on Science and
Technology recommended that Project Anna, dod’s geodetic satellite, be declared an international scientific satellite.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	39
March 21: nasa announced selection of Westinghouse Electric Coro, as contractor for constructing and testing prototypes and flight models of the S-52 U.S.-U.K. scientific satellite. Second of the three satellites in this program, S-52 was scheduled for launch from Wallops Station, Va., m 1963, would contain 3 major experiments for measurement of galactic radio noise, of vertical distribution of ozone, and of micrometeorite flux.
March 21-22: Fourth meeting of the Panel on Science and Technology of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics held. Fifteen leading American scientists and engineers plus Dr. George B. Kistiakowsky, Dr. Harrison S. Brown, and Sir Bernard Lovell discussed mapping and geodetic satellites, propulsion problems, use of boron as a fuel element in space flight, and the need to strengthen universities in the training of scientists and engineers. Dr. James Van Allen commended nasa for “marked improvement” during the past two years in its fostering of university scientific research and training programs and suggested that five per cent of the national space budget be so invested.
March 22: Experimental ejection-seat capsule for use in supersonic aircraft was ejected from usaf B-58 at 870 mph and 35,000 ft. Bear and capsule landed safely by parachute near Edwards afb. Calif., 7 min. 49 sec. later.
•	usaf launched a Minuteman from a silo at amr and sent it 4,000
miles downrange, the seventh straight success in the Minuteman silo-launch test series.
•	Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Jodrell Bank Experimental
Station in England, testified before the House Science and Astronautics Committee that life on other planets was a real possibility, estimated that four per cent of the billions of stars in the universe must have planets capable of sustaining life. Listening for messages from other planets would not be worthwhile on a random basis; if disarmament came, military radar might be devoted to this purpose, he said.
•	naa announced that Mrs. Constance Wolf would receive the 1961
Montgolfier Award from the fai for her balloon flight from Big Springs, Tex., to Boley, Okla., on November 19-20,1961. Claiming 15 world records, Mrs. Wolf would be the first woman to receive this international award.
March 28: President Kennedy, speaking at the University of California in Berkeley on the occasion of the University’s Charter Day and the awarding to the President of an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, said: “. . . history may well remember this week for . . . the decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to seek concrete agreements on the joint exploration of space . . . the scientific gains the joint effort would offer might be small compared to the gains for world peace. For a cooperative Soviet-American effort in space science and exploration would emphasize the interests that unite us instead of the conflicts that divide us. It offers us an area in which the stale, sterile dogmas of the cold war can be left literally a quarter of a million miles behind. And it would remind us on both sides that knowledge, not hate, is the passkey to the future—that knowledge transcends national antagonisms—that it speaks a universal language— that it is the possession, not of a single class, a single nation or a single ideology, but of all mankind.”
40 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
March 23: usaf combat missile crew launched an Atlas D icbm from Vandenberg afb, Calif., during President Kennedy’s visit to the missile base, the first time an American President had witnessed a live launching of an icbm.

which released an 80-mile-long sodium-vapor cloud to measure air density and wind direction in the upper atmosphere.
•	Early tests of pressure and dynamic stability models of the Apollo
spacecraft were completed in wind tunnels at jpl and Langley Research Center.
•	D. Brainerd Holmes, nasa’s Director of Manned Space Flight,
speaking before the Explorers Club in New York, listed one of the nasa organizational accomplishments of recent months as “the establishment of a liaison office with the Department of Defense, particularly with the Air Force Systems Command.”
•	Bell Telephone Laboratories announced the formation of a new
corporation, Bellcom, Inc., to supply system engineering support to nasa’s space program. The new corporation would be owned jointly by at&t and Western Electric Corp.
•	First U.S. patent granted to a citizen of U.S.S.R. in 10 years was
granted to Nikolai V. Soodnizin of Moscow on a powered device for coupling and uncoupling lengths of pipe in an oil well. U.S.S.R. recently began encouraging its citizens to apply for foreign patents.
March 24'- Two-week meeting of Study Group IV of the International Radio Consultative Committee (ccir) of the International Telecommunication Union (itu) concluded in Washington, D.C. Study Group IV reviewed technical phases of space communications, including the selection of frequencies for telecommunications with and between space vehicles. Over 200 representatives from 30 countries participated in these sessions, Dr. John P. Hagen serving as head of the U.S. delegation.
•	Prof. Auguste Piccard, pioneer Swiss explorer of the stratosphere
and ocean depths, died in Geneva at the age of 78. In 1931 Prof. Piccard ascended to 51,777 ft. in the gondola of a balloon of his own design. In numerous balloon ascents in the 1920’s and 1930’s, he made many studies of radioactivity, atmospheric electricity, cosmic rays, and other scientific phenomena. Turning from the air to the oceans, Prof. Piccard designed his bathyscaphe and in 1953 he and his son reached a depth of two miles. In 1960 the U.S. Navy took an improved version of his craft down to 37,800 ft.
•	Soviet Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, executed in 1937 on Stalin’s
orders and exonerated in 1956, was honored in the official military newspaper, Red Star. It was pointed out that in 1932 Tukhachevsky insisted on the development of rocket engines and that he persisted in this effort until purged.
March 25: National Academy of Sciences announced that the John J. Carty Medal would be awarded Provost Charles H. Townes of mit for his pioneering work in the development of the maser (microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation). Dr. Townes was credited with the conception of the idea for the maser in 1951, which was subsequently used in radio astronomy in recording and charting minute radio signals emanating from
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	41
celestial bodies and to receive echoes of a radar signal reflected from the planet Venus.
March 26: U.S.S.R. submitted information on 16 Soviet space flights for inclusion in the U.N. public registry on space launchings. Included were the manned orbital flights by Majs. Yuri A. Gagarin and Gherman S. Titov. U.S. submitted a similar list to the U.N. on March 5, covering U.S. space launchings to Feb. 15, 1962, that were still in orbit.
•	Coordination of international arrangements for exchange and dis-
semination of weather data, including weather satellite information, was on the agenda of the third session of the U.N.’s Commission for Synoptic Meteorology as it opened a 26-day session in Washington. Technical experts from more than 100 nations had been invited.
•	Dr. James A. Van Allen, Chairman of the Department of Physics
and Astronomy at the State University of Iowa, summarized the satellite and space probe findings about the structure of the geomagnetic field surrounding the earth. Describing the inner zone as relatively stable in intensity of charged particles and caused by a combination of internal and external forces, he said the outer zone showed fluctuations in intensity “by factors of 100 to as much as 1,000,” said these were complexly related to solar flares and geomagnetic storms. The only convincing explanation for the origin of the outer zone yet made is “the capture of ionized solar gas which sweeps by the earth in great clouds from time to time. . . . But the detailed mechanism for producing the observed energy spectrum remains obscure and the nature of this mechanism is perhaps the most interesting unresolved problem in the subject of trapped radiation.”
•	John A. Johnson, General Counsel of nasa, testifying before the
Senate Subcommittee on Monopoly, stated that as of Feb. 28, 1962, a total of 297 inventions had been reported by nasa contractors under the patent provisions of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. Of these, 268 had been determined to be Government property, 29 had been or are being considered for waivers.
March 27: U.S. and U.S.S.R.. technical representatives held the first of a series of talks on the possibility of joint cooperation in space research and exploration. Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of nasa, represented the U.S.; Dr. Anatoli A. Blagonravov, of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, represented the U.S.S.R.	.	.
•	nasa fired a Nike-Cajun rocket from Wallops Station, Va., which
released a sodium vapor cloud between 25 and 74 miles altitude. Rays of the setting sun colored the sodium cloud red, instead of sodium vapor’s normal yellow.
•	In address to the Institute of Radio Engineers in New York, NASA
Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden stated: “The costs of satellites and space probes are so great that every possible step must be taken to assure success. In our scientific experiments we insist that the bench prototype developed by the physicist be redesigned by engineers to meet the environmental requirements, that the engineered prototype be tested on vibrators, in vacuum and temperature chambers and other ground equipment simu-

42 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
lating the space environment beyond the required conditions, and that, if possible, the equipment be tested on the less expensive sounding rockets prior to use on the more expensive satellites. . . .
“To state the matter another way, we desire assured and demonstrated performances and reliability. The cost of the necessary engineering and tests is small compared to the cost of a single failure. We do not wish to be the first to use the newest and most advanced device nor the last to give up the obsolete. A moderately conservative engineering approach with adequate analysis and test is indicated as the best design philosophy.”
March 27: Dr. Edward Teller, testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, recommended a program for establishing a large and independent colony on the moon, as a means of having a working base in space and control of near space from a standpoint of national security. A nuclear reactor should be developed to operate on the moon, eventually to furnish the power to extract water from the moon’s rocks and soil, he said.
March 28: U.S. submitted to the U.N. a supplemental list of U.S. space launchings, covering the period of Feb. 15 to March 15, 1962, updating the coverage of the first U.S. list submitted on March 5, 1962. This second official list did not include Astronaut John Glenn’s 3-orbit flight, since the U.S. contended that the U.N. roster was supposed to contain only those space objects still in orbit, not those that had already re-entered. U.S.S.R. listed all its space flights in its report to the U.N. on March 26. Although MA-6 flight was not registered, the U.S. submitted information on the Glenn flight to the U.N. on April 3.
•	U.S. and Soviet space officials ended two days of technical discus-
sions in New York on possible cooperation in outer space. No public announcements were made.
•	Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee unanimously
approved a bill for ownership and operation of the Nation’s commercial communications satellites.
•	In speech at Worcester, Mass., Gen. Curtis E. LeMay stated that
the U.S.S.R. is “moving at full speed for a decisive capability in space” and that the U.S. could not afford a “fatal technological surprise in the 1970’s.” Gen. LeMay pointed out that many people looked at military space operations as “merely an extension of nuclear weapons. . . . This may not be the case at all. Our national security in the future may depend on armaments vastly different from any we know today, and believe me they won’t be ultimate weapons either.”
•	David Sarnoff, Chairman of the Board of Radio Corp. of America,
speaking to the Institute of Radio Engineers in New York, called for the free world to organize an international community of science, staffed by its best scientific brains, to expand knowledge of basic science and to attack pressing world problems such as global communications and weather and adequacy of world’s food, water, and power supplies.
ASTEONATJTXCAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	43
March 29: In testimony before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Gen. Bernard Schriever, Commander of afsc, discussed the “reciprocal support” between NASA and the usaf, and the national requirement for military space weapons systems. He pointed out that: (1) 102 usaf officers were assigned full-time with nasa as well as 23 Navy and 33 Army; (2) $49 millions of nasa support was funded by the usaf through FY 61 and over $200 millions in FY 62; (3) $270 millions of nasa funds were processed under cognizance of afsc during FY 61; and (4) nasa use of usaf booster, launch, and tracking capabilities and the joint X-15 program further demonstrated “the work nasa and the Air Force are doing together as a team.” Gen. Schriever pointed to the fundamental capabilities of future space weapon systems and the assignment by the Secretary of Defense of major responsibility for military space systems development to the Air Force.
•	President Kennedy sent to Congress a reorganization plan that
would establish an Office of Science and Technology within the White House staff. Its director would advise and assist the President on (1) major science policies and programs in the Federal government; (2) assessment of scientific and technical developments for effect on national policies; (3) review, integration, and coordination of major Federal science activities; (4) ensuring “good and close relations” with Nation’s scientists and engineers. President said this would leave the National Science Foundation free to concentrate on fostering basic research and science education.

Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space began discussions.
•	House Appropriations Committee cut a $65 million nasa item for
purchase of land at Cape Canaveral and in Mississippi from a supplemental appropriations bill for the balance of FY 1962. The action was taken because the House Science and Astronautics Committee had not authorized the expenditure. Approved was $80 million for development, $5 million less than nasa asked for.
•	Army announced that Nike-Zeus antimissile missile had intercepted
3,000-mph Nike-Hercules missile in test over White Sands.

APRIL 1962
April 1: Beginning of third year of successful weather satellite operation by the U.S. nasa’s tiros i, launched on April 1, 1960, performed beyond all expectations, operated for 78 days, transmitted almost 23,000 cloud photos, of which some 19,000 were useful to meteorologists, tiros ii, launched November 23, 1960, transmitted more than 33,000 photos and one year after launch was still occasionally taking useful photos, tiros hi, launched July 12, 1961, took 24,000 cloud photos and was most spectacular as a “hurricane hunter.” tiros iv, launched February 8, 1962, has averaged 250 operationally-useful photos per day.
•	Senator Margaret Chase Smith, in a radio interview with Senator
Kenneth B. Keating, expressed doubt on the value of space cooperation with the U.S.S.R. A member of the Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, Sen. Smith said the U.S. had “decided superiority over Russia on really important space development. Russia has the edge over us on thrust power but when it comes to finer scientific space developments and information, we have great superiority over Russia. Perhaps one of our greatest areas of superiority is in the development of miniaturization. I think we could learn something from Russia but there is a question as to just how far we can trust her and what we get in return.”
April 2: oso i, launched March 7, 1962, was reported by nasa to be performing well. As of this date, 360 telemetry data tapes had been recorded from 403 orbits. Tapes would require about one year for complete analysis of data.
•	Dr. John A. Simpson, of the University of Chicago’s Enrico Fermi
Institute for Nuclear Studies, said in a Voice of America broadcast that space probes and satellites have offered the scientist the first tools for direct measurement and study of electrodynamics in the interplanetary medium, explorer x, for example, had recorded a density of protons in space substantially below predicted values and “almost one million billion times less than the best vacuum that man creates in the laboratory.
“Such experiments in space emphasize the fact that there occur phonemena in nature which cannot be scaled down without losing the essence of their physical properties.”
•	usaf announced it would build a new phased-array radar system
that would have a multiple-track capability and quicker reflexes than present radar for the detection, tracking, identification, and cataloging of satellites. Contractor woud be Bendix Aviation Corp.
April 8: Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee opened hearings to determine whether the U.S. has paid “unnecessary and excessive profits” to companies working on dod contracts. Sen. John L. McClellan, chairman of the committee, announced 40
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	47
that investigation would begin with the Army's family of Nike missiles, to be followed by the usaf’s Atlas.
April 3: usaf said it would procure twelve additional Thor space boosters to meet future requirements. Since January 1957 there have been 142 launches of Thor with 111 successes, thirteen partial successes, and eighteen failures.
•	LCdr J. W. Young piloted F4H-1 to its seventh world time-to-climb
mark, reaching 25,000 meters in 230.44 seconds.
April Jf.: nasa Administrator James E. Webb, speaking before the National Association of Broadcasters in Chicago, cited nasa’s space sciences program as “a quest for fundamental knowledge” without which the applied science and technology “would soon run dry. . . . Suppose we had laid out a program five or six years ago, directly tied to manned space flight. We would never have discovered the Great Radiation Belt, which . . . constitutes one of the severest manned-space flight problems we face.”
•	Soviet cosmonauts have had changes introduced into their training,
including special gymnastics, in an attempt to offset nausea induced by prolonged weightlessness, according to Trud, newspaper of the Central Labor Union.
•	Army fired Pershing missile 200 miles at amr, 29th success out of
33 test firings.

Armstrong was pilot. Whereas the previous control system was automatic only while the X-15 was within the atmosphere and the pilot had to control flight with reaction jets while in space, the new system would be automatic in both regimes.
•	Two outstanding challenges to science today were the conquest of
space and the achieving of controlled fusion power, Dr. Peter L. Kapitza, one of Russia’s leading physicists, wrote in the April issue of the Bulletin oj the Atomic Scientists. Very-long-range rockets would have little practical use except as a means of cheap, safe disposal of radioactive waste in outer space, he said.
•	Army launched Nike-Zeus missile in what was described as a
successful intercept of a simulated icbm nose cone.
48 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 19 62
AprUm6: nasa sponsored a day-long technical symposium in Washington on results of the MA-6 three-orbit space flight. Astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr., and officials of Project Mercury reviewed the findings of the Feb. 20 flight and stressed the conclusion that the presence of the astronaut had been indispensable to successful completion of the three-orbit mission. On the Glenn effect—the firefly-like particles Glenn reported seeing outside his capsule during each of the three sunrises—Dr. John A. O’Keefe, Assistant Chief, Theoretical Division, Goddard Space Flight Center, reported that study had shown them to be flakes of paint from the spacecraft.
•	nasa research pilot Glenn W. Stinnett and Stanford physiologist
Dr. Terence A. Rogers emerged from 7-day confinement in a simulated lunar spacecraft. Unique study by Ames Research Center involved performance of continuous and realistic professional tasks while under confined space flight conditions.
•	Soviet Union announced launching of cosmos ii satellite (975-mile
apogee, 133-mile perigee, 49° inclination, 102.5-minute period). cosmos ii reportedly had the same instrumentation as cosmos i launched on March 16: investigation of radio transmission, radiation belts, magnetic field of the earth, distribution and formation of cloud cover, and to test “elements of space vehicle construction.”
•	Test flight of first Atlas-Centaur rocket canceled because of heavy
cloud-cover at Cape Canaveral.
•	In ejection capsule test, brown bear “Big John” rode in capsule
ejected from B-58 at 1,060 mph and 45,000 ft. and parachuted to earth near Edwards afb, Calif.
•	In testimony before Senate subcommittee, Federal Communications
Commissioner T.A.M. Craven reported that talks with Russian and other representatives had been encouraging on establishment of a global communications satellite system, fcc Chairman Newton N. Minow said that fcc “could live with” the proposed U.S. corporation with stock to be owned by the public and by communications companies. The fcc was, Minow stated, ill equipped to handle a Government-owned system.
•	Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa’s Director of Space Sciences, speaking to
a sectional meeting of the American Society for Engineering Education at Texas Technological College, Lubbock, Texas, said: “. . . accomplishing the space mission absolutely requires the strong and vigorous participation of our colleges and universities, which in turn requires that nasa bear its fair share of the support required to make it possible for the universities and colleges to participate. The universities must bear their share of responsibility to the space program and allocate an appropriate fraction of their material, as well as human, resources to the effort. In such a partnership, nasa stands ready to invest an appreciable fraction of its resources.”
•	Soviet Academician Leonid Sedov denied in interview with Trud
that U.S.S.R. had launched other men into orbit besides Majs. Gagarin and Titov. U.S. press had speculated that as many as five Russian cosmonauts had been killed in unsuccessful flights.
•	Space-age religion must be an “open undogmatic religion which
itself reaches out for undiscovered truth,” Rabbi Sheldon H.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	49
Blank, professor at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, said in Williamsburg, Va. If space exploration discovers rational people living on other planets, religious people on earth “will have to abandon parochialism and reach for a God who is less comfortably near than we have wanted to believe.”
April 7: Atlas-Centaur launching from amr was again postponed, this time because of high-altitude winds.
•	A censored transcript of testimony before a closed hearing of the
House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee by Dr. Harold Brown, dod’s Director of Research and Engineering, on March 19, was released, disclosing questions by Chairman George H. Mahon on security aspects of the prepared statement which outlined dod’s r&d projects. Dr. Brown replied that it was necessary under the U.S. system to inform the public, that no numbers of weapons or specific capabilities of weapons were given, and that “having the other side know what we are thinking can in some cases be useful.”
•	Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of England’s Jodrell Bank radiotele-
scope, said in an interview in Los Angeles that Soviet secrecy with regard to their space launches was justified. “There are two ways of looking at this thing, you know. In scientific circles it is customary not to announce an achievement until it has actually proven a success.”
•	Educational Testing Service received a $30,300 grant from the
National -Science Foundation for the showing of science films over stations of the National Educational TV Network of 58 stations.
•	State Board of Education in Minnesota voted to stop requiring
any science or mathematics as prerequisite to high-school graduation. Members argued that some students were not suited to courses in science and mathematics.
April 8: Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, in a Tass interview, said: “It is now necessary to determine how long a man can operate in outer space without prejudice to his health—five days, ten days, or more. This is one of the main tasks before proceeding to more complex flights to the moon, for example, or to the establishment of orbital or interplanetary stations.” He criticized the U.S. for being “reluctant” to file details of the Glenn flight with the U.N. “The best information about outer space has been obtained in the U.S.S.R. The Americans can benefit more by our experience than we by theirs. Some people in America are not interested in exchanges of scientific information.” The U.S. had submitted information concerning the Glenn flight to the U.N. on April 3,1962.
•	Surveyed by the Washington Post on the proposal to fire rockets
loaded with radioactive waste into outer space, Washington-area clergymen responded variously. Comments on the proposal ranged from a “dreadful desecration of the Heavens” to a “fulfillment of the divine commandment to protect man and the earth on which he dwells.” Soviet nuclear scientist, Dr. Peter Kapitza, had made the proposal in the April issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
50 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
April 9: Astronaut John H. Glenn was awarded the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society “for extraordinary contributions to scientific knowledge of the world and beyond as a pioneer in exploring the ocean of space.” Awarded only 20 times since it was struck in 1906, the Hubbard Medal honorees have included Adm. Robert E. Peary, Charles A. Lindbergh, Roald Amundsen, and Adm. Richard E. Byrd.
•	Aerospace Medical Association, meeting in Atlantic City, heard
research papers indicating new findings about space radiation. Dr. Sol M. Michaelson, of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, said preliminary evidence from animal tests indicates the possibility that one type of radiation exposure—mild amounts of microwave—might enhance recovery from x-ray damage because it generated increased activity in the bone marrow. Maj. Robert W. Zellmer (usaf), of the School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks afb, Texas, said tests on rats indicated the possibility that seriously excessive G forces, such as experienced during launch and re-entry of a spacecraft, might also give some protection against radiation.
•	usaf launched its fifth unidentified satellite employing an Atlas-
Agena B booster, from Point Arguello, Calif. In Washington, the State Department said the satellite would be registered with the U.N. if it went into orbit and stayed in sustained orbit.
•	President Kennedy nominated Dr. J. Herbert Holloman to the new
post of Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology. Dr. Holloman was general manager of the General Engineering Laboratory of GE in Schenectady, N.Y.
•	An Atlas icbm blew up on the pad during launching at amr. The
missile had been heavily instrumented in an effort to determine causes of difficulties on recent flights.
•	Joint aec-dod announcement designated a second nuclear test
area in the Pacific, this one centering on Johnston Island and enclosing an area with a radius of 470 mi. on the surface, expanding to an area with a radius of 700 mi. at 30,000 ft. and above. Ban on entering the area would become effective April 30.
•	U.S. space experiments with regard to the moon may well give
scientists new information on “how the Earth and the planets and the Sun were formed,” Dr. Gordon J. F. MacDonald, Associate Director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics of the University of California, said in a Voice of America broadcast. The seismometer to be landed on the moon by nasa’s Ranger, for example, would help determine whether there are “moonquakes” some eight times more frequent than earthquakes, as there should be if the moon contains the same concentration of radioactive elements as the earth.
•	European Broadcasting Union ended a 20-nation conference in
Seville, Spain, with an announcement that preliminary arrangements had been made for an international television service by use of communications satellites. Three U.S. television networks—cbs, nbc, and abc—would join with usia to operate the system from the U.S., transmitting from Andover, Maine, and the European receiving station would be the British General Post Office Facilities in Cornwall, which would relay the signals to other members of the European Broadcasting Union.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	51
April 9: U.S.S.R. Presidium of the Supreme Soviet declared April 12, anniversary of the first Soviet space flight, to be a national annual holiday in Russia. In announcing ceremonies for Cosmonautics Day m the Soviet Union, Leonid Korneyev reviewed the U.S.S.R.’s space program from its beginning in April 1932, with the formation of a group to study jet propulsion. Between 1932 and 1941, Korneyev pointed out, the U.S.S.R. had developed 118 different liquid-fuel rocket engines.
April 10: Fifty-five delegates from the U.N. toured the Atlantic Missile Range at the invitation of the State Department. Six Communist countries were represented, but delegates from the U.S.S.R. had declined at the last minute. Among the sights were the U.S.-U.K. satellite scheduled for launch that day but postponed because of trouble in the second stage of the Thor-Delta booster, the Saturn rocket being prepared for launching, and the Project Mercury site and control room.
•	Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach testified before
the Senate Commerce Committee that the compromise communications satellite bill, while generally acceptable to the Administration, would place control of the system in the communications industry. “There is real danger,’’ he said, “that ground stations, if separately owned by the carriers, may because of their high cost represent an obstacle to technical growth so as prematurely to freeze the type of system.” The compromise bill, approved by the Senate Space Committee two weeks ago, provided for a 50-50 split of the stock in the satellite corporation between the communications industry and other companies and investors.
•	Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, Commander of afsc, said in a speech at
Mississippi State College: “The Materials Laboratories at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base developed the basic material and structures used in ‘sandwich construction’ of aircraft; titanium alloy as a structural material; plastic, ceramics, and metallic alloys to withstand the high temperatures encountered during re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere.”
•	The Boys Clubs of America honored Lt. Col. John H. Glenn, Jr.,
for his example of good citizenship to youth, presenting him with the “Man and Boy Award” at Alexandria, Va.
•	First stage (S—I) for Saturn vehicle SA-3 had its first flight qualifi-
cation test at msfc, all eight engines firing for 30 sec.
April 11: nasa Administrator James E. Webb, testifying before the Senate Committee on Commerce, supported the President’s bill setting up a communications satellite corporation and approved of the Senate amendments, except for a caution on the one that would direct the fcc to encourage communications common carriers to build and own their own ground stations. Mr. Webb summarized nasa's responsibilities under the bill: (1) to advise fcc on the technical characteristics of the system; (2) to advise fcc on the technical feasibility of attaining the desired technical characteristics; (3) to coordinate its space communications r&d work with that of the corporation; (4) to furnish launching facilities, vehicles, and services in connection with the development and operation of the system; (5) to furnish other services on a reimbursable basis; and (6) to advise the Secretary of State on technical feasibility of the system providing communications service to a particular point in the world.
52 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OR 1962
April 11: usaf launched an Atlas missile from Yandenberg afb, Calif., in a test flight down the Pacific Missile Range. A sac combat missile crew launched the Atlas from a horizontal, semi-hard “coffin” launcher.
•	In a recent tightening of dod policy on information about military
satellite launchings, officials were reported to have stated that in future even the Discoverer flights would not be so identified. Any information beyond bare announcement of launch of an unidentified satellite would be considered on a case-by-case basis.
•	Atlas-Centaur initial launch from amr was again postponed by
nasa, this time because of fueling problems.
•	Robert J. Lacklen, nasa’s Director of Personnel, said that the first
part of nasa’s nationwide recruiting drive to hire 2,000 scientists and engineers had ended on March 15, with the completion of the field work. During this phase, teams of interviewers contacted 14,000 persons, interviewed 5,000. The second phase would involve setting up a national job register.
•	Dr. Ross A. McFarland of Harvard University was awarded the
Walter Boothby Award by the Aerospace Medical Assn, for outstanding research directed at the promotion of health and prevention of disease in professional airline pilots.
April 12: nasa was studying the problem of falling fragments from orbital objects and the possibility of injury or damage to persons or property on earth. Four fragments from the Atlas booster that put Astronaut John Glenn into orbit were recovered on earth, the first pieces known to have re-entered from an orbiting object without burning up. Statistically the chances of injury to anyone on earth would be extremely small, especially since the orbits are over water about 80% of the time, nasa pointed out that some 100 meteorites weighing two pounds or more struck the U.S. every year, yet there had never been a report of anyone being struck by one.
•	usaf Blue Scout launched from Cape Canaveral but second stage
did not fire.
•	nasa would begin an education program in the fall of 1962 to provide
financial support for 10 doctoral candidates in science and engineering at each of 10 U.S. universities, nasa Administrator dames E. Webb announced to the Institute of Environmental Sciences in Chicago. Students would receive a stipend of $2,400 per year, expenses up to $1,000 per year, and the university would be reimbursed for tuition, fees, and other expenses. Grants would be for one year, renewable to a maximum of three years. Mr. Webb said nasa expected the program “will increase considerably in years to come.”
•	nasa awarded $1,000 to nasa engineers for inventions contributing
to the advancement of aeronautical and space science and technology. Langley Research Center’s Henry J. E. Reid, Jr., and H. Douglas Garner split a $1,000 award for conceiving a simple, lightweight attitude control system to control the axis of a spinning vehicle. Goddard Space Flight Center’s James S. Albus received a $1,000 award for his digital solar aspect sensor that has been flown in several Explorer satellites.

•	National holiday in the Soviet Union, the anniversary of orbital
flight of Yuri Gagarin. In ceremony in the Kremlin’s Congress Hall, Cosmonaut Gagarin declared: “We are on the threshold of more new space launchings. When these space ships return to earth, the Soviet people will have more holidays to celebrate.” Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev and Cosmonaut Titov also made short speeches, while Matislav Keldysh, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, made the major address.
•	Pravda editorial extolled the future of communism as demonstrated
by Soviet space achievements as follows: “The successes of the Soviet conquerors of space reflect the great achievements of the Soviet people in the development of the mighty productive forces of our homeland, the indisputable advantages of socialism, and its superiority over the capitalist system. The most reasonable representatives of the western world cannot fail to admit that socialism, as Comrade Khrushchev put it, is indeed the reliable launching pad from which the Soviet Union launches its spaceships.
“Only a year has passed since a Soviet man heralded the dawn of the space age by making his first flight into interplanetary space, but this year has been packed with great events. The 22nd cpsu Congress adopted a party program which gave wings to the Soviet people and marked out the clear prospects for building communism. Guided by the historic decisions of the congress and the new party program, our Soviet people will exert every effort to foster the building of a communist society, the bright future of all mankind . . . .”
In Tass statement, Cosmonaut Gherman Titov described Cosmonautics Day as a “holiday of labor and man’s victory over the forces of nature.”
April IS: nasa announced the X-15 had been assigned a service function in aeronautical and space research beyond its original role as an experimental test vehicle. The National Research Airplane Committee, composed of nasa, usaf, and usn delegates, had approved a series of experiments including ultraviolet stellar photography, horizon scanning for research on accurate horizon sensing in space vehicles, atmospheric density and micrometeorite measurements, and evaluation of advanced systems and structures.
•	In a nasa press conference on the X-15 additional research program,
Mr. John Stack, nasa’s Director of Aeronautical Research, said: “. . . when I was talking about the total research airplane program, this started really because two men in high positions in a time of great stress also had time to think of the future, and I refer to General Arnold and Dr. George W. Lewis. And when this approach, this sort of thing, was put to them in late ’42—and you can readily appreciate General Arnold and Mr. Lewis were
54 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
pretty busy men at that time—they did under the stress of all that find time to think also of the future. And this kind of a program that has progressed is a kind of a monument to the foresight of those two men.”
April 18: nasa Administrator James E. Webb, addressing the National Conference of the American Society for Public Administration in Detroit, said: “No new department or agency in the recent history of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government was created through the transfer of as many units from other departments and agencies as in the case of nasa. Three and one half years ago, nasa did not exist. Today nasa comprises approximately 20,500 employees, ten major field centers, and an annual budget approaching the $2 billion mark.”
•	Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aero-
nautics and Space Council, was awarded the Arnold Air Society’s trophy as the civilian who had made the most outstanding contribution to aerospace science and national security in 1961.
April 18-14: U.S. Army claimed two world flight records for time-to-climb in a helicopter in flights made at Fort Worth, Texas. On April 13, Capt. Boyce B. Buckner (usa) piloted a YHU-lD Iroquois helicopter to 6,000 meters (19,686 ft.) in 5 min. 51 sec. On April 14, Lt. Col. Leland F. Wilhelm (usa) took the turbine-powered helicopter to 3,000 meters (9,843 ft.) in 2 min. 14.6 sec.
April 14: Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa’s Director of Space Sciences, said that in addition to nasa’s international program for space science and the European organizations for cooperative space research, “some South American groups are considering the possibility of cooperative sounding rocket endeavors.”
•	usaf selected proposals submitted by United Technology Corp.
for the 120-inch solid motor and stl-arma for the guidance efforts to be placed in Titan III which will serve as a large space booster. Contracts were contingent upon final program approval.
April 15: U.S. Weather Bureau began daily international transmissions of cloud maps based on photos taken by tiros iv. This was the first time that the actual cloud map was sent abroad by radio facsimile, although coded data had been sent previously.
•	In an article in Ekonomicheskya Gazeta, the economic newspaper of
the Soviet Communist Party, Dr. Peter Kapitza, one of Russia’s outstanding physicists, said that Soviet science had been hampered by attempts to judge the validity of scientific theories on the basis of Marxist dialectics. If Soviet scientists had listened to Marxist philosophers in the 1950’s, he said, the Russian achievements in space would have been impossible.
April 16: Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa’s Deputy Administrator, speaking to the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Atlantic City, said: “. . . the air age brought us great supplies of aluminum and the basis for building lightweight structures, not only for airplanes but also for trains, buses, and ships. The nuclear age brought applications of isotopes in medicine and in inspection of materials. Nuclear developments brought remote manipulators and sealed pumps for hazardous liquids and gases. The space age has brought to maturity the concept of systems analysis and optimization of designs involving many branches of science and engineering. In addition the space
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	55
age has given us high-temperature ceramics, ablating materials for heat protection, pressure-stabilized lightweight tanks, computers handling large amounts of data, and many other developments which are finding application throughout industry.” April 16: Senate passed the nasa supplemental appropriations bill, with amendments providing $71,000,000 for construction at amh but contingent on passage of authorization legislation. Bill would now go to Senate-House conference to iron out differences between the versions passed by the two Houses.

•	Dr. Gerald de Vancouleurs, Professor of Astronomy at the Uni-
versity of Texas, said in nas Voice of America broadcast that the discovery of clues to the prehistory of the solar system and possible contact with extraterrestrial forms of life “stand out as two of the most challenging and promising goals of space exploration.” Dr. de Vancouleurs pointed out that direct sampling and probing of the surface and crusts of the moon and planets may help discover these clues. “Of even greater scientific and philosophic interest,” he said, “is the probability that direct exploration of at least one planet—Mars—may place us in contact with extraterrestrial forms of life, whose study may help solve the problems of the origin and evolution of life under different planetary conditions.”
April 17: nasa launched a Nike-Cajun sounding rocket from Wallops Station, Va., which detonated 12 grenades from 25 to 57 mi. altitude. Fifteen minutes later a Nike-Asp sounding rocket was launched. It released a cloud of sodium vapor from 26 to 144 mi. altitude in a study of wind velocities and upper-atmosphere densities.

•	Subcommittee on Patents of the House Committee on Science and
Astronautics released its report following three years of study of the operation of the patent provisions of the Space Act of 1958. The report of the subcommittee headed by Rep. Emilio Q. Daddario contended the patent provisions that gave the Government title to most inventions resulting from NASA-financed research were damaging to small business, cost the taxpayer money, diluted the national space effort, and made industry reluctant to market the products of such research. Recommended that patent ownership in most cases be turned over to industry, with Government retaining royalty-free use. A minority report by Rep. William F. Ryan pointed out that with almost 95% of Government research money “going to big business, retention of title by the contractors will inevitably bring about concentration of technology and economic power.”
•	Howard Simons reported that many U.S. space experts feel that the
U.S.S.R. has reshaped its space program from a few, spreadout “spectaculars” to a more orderly scientific program. While spectaculars have not been abandoned, it was thought the bulk of the program would be conducted with smaller, cheaper rockets for more useful scientific objectives and with more international cooperation. This was considered to be a victory for Soviet scientists over military and political planners who had favored the spectaculars.
•	Reuters reported that the Tower of London had been asked by
Airresearch Manufacturing Co., of Los Angeles, for information on the finely articulated joints in a suit of armor once worn by Henry VIII as a possible aid in spacesuit design. The 94-lb. suit of armor was designed for jousting tournaments with the wearer on foot; it covered the whole body and its joints permitted full mobility.
April 18: nasa approved the highest national priority for the Apollo program, covering Saturn C-l, Saturn C-5, Titan II, and Atlas-Agena launch vehicles, as well as all stages and engines connected with the vehicles.
•	nasa announced that the first Centaur launch was due no earlier
than April 20. Postponement on April 11 was caused by too low calibration of a transducer, which gave a false indication of the pressurization of the fuel systems in the Atlas booster.
•	nasa announced it would begin taking applications for additional
astronauts now and continue until June 1, 1962. In July persons meeting the requirements would be interviewed, selected applicants given thorough physicals, and final selection of some 5 to 10 astronauts would be made in the fall. Qualifications were also announced; these were slightly less demanding in terms of test-pilot time, but more demanding in that they lowered the age limit to under 35 and required a college degree in science or engineering.

•	Attempt at first flight test of nasa’s Centaur was canceled because
of troubles in the ground-handling equipment used to pump liquid oxygen into the vehicle.
•	nasa published an integrated series of three Quality Publications
setting forth nasa’s intensified quality assurance program now required in nasa space programs from r&d concept through space operations. These publications required nasa prime and subcontractors on space system work to establish and maintain a quality program that in many elements was beyond traditional quality control. They also provided guidelines for nasa management to evaluate contractor quality performance both as a factor of current contract performance and as a consideration in award of future contracts.
•	White House released report on “Strengthening the Behavioral
Science” prepared at the request of the President’s Science Advisory Committee by a subpanel headed by Prof. Neal E. Miller of Yale University. The report submitted that “the general issues studied by behavioral scientists are critically important to our national welfare and security,” and that “ways must be found to strengthen these disciplines and improve their use.” It recommended increasing general and specific education in the behavioral sciences following the lead in the physical sciences. It also suggested that the Social Science Research Council be invited to appoint a standing committee, and that a group of representatives of relevant governmental agencies be created, to review and provide “appropriate advice in the light of current possibilities and needs of behavioral science.”
•	usaf announced selection of seven usaf officers and one usn officer

•	Sir Frederick Handley Page, British aviation pioneer, and chairman
and managing director of Handley Page Ltd., died in London at age 76. Inventor of the slotted wing, he provided England with its first bombers in 1915 and his Halifax bomber of World War II, of which more than 60,000 were produced, was a key weapon of raf Bomber Command.
April 22: Jacqueline Cochran became first woman to pilot a jet aircraft across the Atlantic and claimed 49 world records in 5,120-mile flight from New Orleans, La., to Hanover, Germany, with stops at Gander and Shannon, in a Lockheed Jet Star.
April 23: nasa’s ranger iv was launched by Atlas-Agena from amr, went into parking orbit, and was put into proper trajectory to the moon by restart of the Agena B booster. Failure of a timer in the ranger iv payload caused loss of both internal and ground control over the vehicle. Analysis of the trajectory indicated that the payload would probably slain the leading edge of the moon on April 25 and be pulled by the moon’s gravity to a crashlanding on the far side of the moon, but that none of the experiments would operate and no data would be received.
•	U.S. and U.S.S.R. scientists have agreed on a proposal to establish
a “world weather watch” for improved collection, analysis, and dissemination of world weather information by means of conventional weather techniques and weather satellites. Dr. Harry Wexler, Director of Research, U.S. Weather Bureau, and Dr. Viktor A. Bugaev, Assistant Director of the Hydrometeorological Service, U.S.S.R., drafted the plan at the World Meteorological Organization headquarters in Geneva. Plan would call for expanded and improved weather observation by both conventional and satellite means, the establishment of world and regional weather centers to collect, analyze, and disseminate weather information, including participation by underdeveloped countries through pooling of their resources to develop regional weather forecasting centers. Soviet participation was indicated by Dr. Konstantin T. Logvinov, Deputy Director of U.S.S.R.’s Hydrometeorological Service. He indicated possibility of Soviet weather satellites, although he said U.S.S.R. was not as advanced as U.S. in this area—“We are just learning from American experience”—and establishment in U.S.S.R. of a ground station to receive cloud-cover photos from satellites. The proposed global weather plan was to be submitted to the WTorld Meteorological Organization May 22 and then to the U.N.
•	First International Symposium on Rocket and Satellite Meteorology
opened in Washington, D.C. Attended bv some 500 delegates from more than 20 nations, the conference was sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization, the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, and the Committee on Space Research of the International Council of Scientific Unions. It was hoped that the symposium would lead to an international sounding rocket program during the International Year of the Quiet Sun in 1964-65.

April 23: National Council of the Federation of American Scientists adopted a policy statement that space activities should be classified only when there are compelling military reasons.
•	In Voice of America broadcast, Dr. Leo Goldberg of the Harvard
College Observatory reported that the accumulation of knowledge in solar physics is proceeding “at a fantastic rate, due to the inherent importance of the subject coupled with a sudden fusing of new instrumental techniques and theoretical ideas.” Dr. Goldberg noted that sun spots in the photosphere have been the object of intense study since Galileo but that “observations have not yet been synthesized to provide even an accurate description of their physical nature, let alone the mechanism of their origin.” Crediting high-altitude rockets for initial detection and occasional study of hidden solar radiation, detailed study requires continous observation of the sun on a 24-hour basis, which “can only be accomplished with the aid of one or more satellite observatories.”
•	National Academy of Sciences awarded the J. Lawrence Smith
Medal for outstanding achievement in the investigation of meteoric bodies to Dr. Harold C. Urey of the University of California of San Diego. The award was based upon Dr. Urey’s many publications on the chemical composition of meteorites, only one of his most recent fields of interest. He received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1934. After World War II he launched into speculations concerning the origin of the solar system, the cosmic abundance of the elements, the composition and structure of the moon and the planets, the latter work depending upon his chemical analysis of meteorites.
April Joint U.S.-Japanese sounding rocket launching at Wallops Station, Va., was postponed because of high winds.
•	U.S.S.R. launched cosmos iii, identified by Tass as another of the

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	61
April #5:’'Saturn (SA-2) booster rocket was successfully launched from amr in its second flight test. Like the first Saturn vehicle launched on October 27, 1961, the Saturn fired only the first-stage engines, generating 1.3 million lbs. of thrust. Dummy second ana third stages filled with water were detonated at 65 miles altitude (Project High Water) and the water ballast formed an artificial cloud. Maximum velocity was slightly more than 3,700 mph. Modifications to decrease the slight fuel sloshing encountered near the end of the previous flight test were apparently successful.
•	Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aero-
nautics and Space Council, stated that the U.S. program for peaceful development of space was not inconsistent with military space development, in a speech before the National Capitol Section of the ars. “The true mission of our military strength is to protect the peace,” he said. “If we do not take adequate care of our national defense, we will not have a chance to do any of the other things in space—at least as free men.”
•	D. Brainerd Holmes, nasa’s Director of Manned Space Flight,
speaking before the American Management Association in New York, said: “We believe that the soundness of our present engineering program can be illustrated by the correlation between predicted events and time of occurrence in John Glenn’s recent flight. Indeed, the time from lift-off to impact in this mission was within one second of the pre-flight calculations.”
•	U.S. resumed atmospheric nuclear testing in Operation Dominic
with the detonation of a medium-yield device dropped from an aircraft near Christmas Island in the Pacific.
•	American Newspaper Publishers Association meeting in New York,
set up a scientific advisory committee to make a year’s study of possible application to newspapers of space technology, nuclear energy, computer technology, and other developments.

Pierce of Bell Telephone Lab.
April 26: A very eventful day in space exploration: launched into orbit were ariel i, cosmos iv, and two unidentified usaf satellites; ranger iv impacted the far side of the moon; and a U.S.-Japa-nese probe was launched from Wallops.
•	ranger iv impacted on the moon at 7:49:53 AM est, ending a
231,486-mi. journey from amr that began with its launching on April 23. Goldstone Tracking Station maintained contact with the 50-milliwatt transmitter in the lunar landing capsule until it passed behind the left edge of the moon. Impact velocity was 5,963 mph, point of impact 229.3° E, 15.5° S, on a part of the moon never seen by man. ranger iv’s instrumentation, which ceased useful operation some ten hours after launch, never functioned again. About the same time as the lunar impact, the Agena B 2nd stage passed to the right of the moon and went into orbit around the sun.
62 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962
April 26: Ariel i (S-51), the first international satellite, launched into orbit from Cape Canaveral by Thor-Delta booster. The 132-lb. spacecraft was built by gsfc of nasa and carried six British experiments to make integrated measurements in the ionosphere. Three experiments measured electron density, temperatures, and composition of positive ions in the ionosphere, while two experiments were designed to monitor the intensity of radiation from the sun in the ultraviolet and x-ray bands of the solar corona. The sixth experiment was designed to measure cosmic rays, supported by simultaneous experiments from ground and by aircraft and balloon flights.
•	U.S. and Japan launched a joint sounding rocket from Wallops
Station, Va. nasa furnished the Nike-Cajun rocket, launch facilities, data acquisition, and a langmuir probe to measure electron temperature. Japan furnished instrumentation, a device designed to measure electron temperature and density simultaneously, functions which up to now have required two separate instruments. Height of the flight was 75.6 mi.
•	U.S.S.R. launched cosmos iv, presumably another in the recent
series of scientific satellites. Orbital data: apogee, 206 mi.; perigee, 186 mi.; period, 90.6 min.; and inclination, 65°. No other details were announced.
•	In address at Tulane University, Dr. James R. Killian, President
of mit, stated that the Soviet Union had placed “their first rate people” in their space program and thus weakened their high-energy physics program. “We must be very careful in space exploration that we do not tend to draw strength from other technological areas. We need balance,” he said.
•	nasa deadline for proposals invited from 15 companies for detailed

•	nasa graduated first group of Project Mercury tracking personnel
completing new course at Wallops Station, the seven graduates representing personnel from nas a and dod contractors. Directed by gsfc, the Mercury Network Training Program consists of specialized courses to support the man in space mission, one requiring that the subsystems at all 18 sites in a global network are continuously monitored and provide precise data concerning the spacecraft’s location, altitude, and operational status as well as the astronaut’s condition. Real-time data must flow between the sites, the Computer Center at gsfc, and the Mercury Control Center at Cape Canaveral.
•	Reported that nasa had drafted for review by other Government
agencies a policy statement on measures being studied for the prevention of rocket booster parts surviving re-entry, possibly injuring life and property on earth. Fragments of MA-6 booster had surprisingly survived re-entry. Measures, as reported, included programed booster destruction, perhaps at the cost of payload weight.
•	Maj. Gen. O. J. Ritland (usaf), formerly Commander of afsc’s

April 26: The Senate Committee on Commerce concluded its hearings on S. 2814 to establish a commercial communications satellite system.
•	Separation of the disciplines of geology and geophysics in U.S.
universities is “nothing short of an intellectual outrage,” Dr. Uoyd V. Berkner told the American Geophysical Union in Washington when that organization presented him with its first John Adams Fleming Award. Only three American universities were moving toward broad programs in geophysical study, he said. He urged the nas and universities to work toward programs that would recognize that geology and geophysics are now “intimately intertwined.”

R. Dyer, Jr., of the Space Science Board Secretariat, stated that
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	65
the history of astronomy is an alternation between major technological and theoretical advances. “The stage is set,” he said, “for the next two big steps.” The first will be the space-age technology enabling observation of the stars, nebulosities and galaxies using new devices capturing practically all octaves in the scale of radiation ranging from the very high-frequency gamma rays to the slow undulations of the longest radio waves. The second of the anticipated major advances will be a theoretical revolution, the nature of which will depend on results of improved observation techniques. These new findings “will either explain the universe on classical evolutionary grounds or demand a revision of fundamental physical theory at least as far reaching as the Theory of Relativity or the Quantum Theory.”
April SO: In address to ias meeting in St. Louis, George M. Low, nasa Director of Spacecraft and Flight Missions, concluded with a statement of basic organizational concepts: “We believe that we must obtain the very best efforts of the very best people we can find, both in Government and industry, if we are to achieve our National goal. We believe that our organizational concepts and management techniques must be no less excellent than our technical efforts. We believe that with constant attention to these concepts, and with the hard work and dedication of the people involved, we will be able to carry out our responsibility to our Country to be second to none in man’s conquest of space.”
•	Report released by White House of study committee examining
nonprofit research groups. Report stated that Government must continue to rely heavily on private institutions, including nonprofit research groups, to carry out Federal research programs. At the same time, the committee recommended that steps be taken to improve the competence of the Government’s own scientific staffs and laboratories to direct research programs.
Late April: faa awarded first seven contracts, totaling $2.66 million, for commercial supersonic transport aircraft, faa Administrator N. E. Halaby said the action was “the first step leading to the development of a safe, practical, economical airplane to carry the traveling public beyond the speed of sound.”
During April: Dr. John C. Houbolt, of nasa’s Langley Research Center, writing in the April issue of Astronautics, outlined the possible advantages of lunar-orbit rendezvous for a manned lunar landing as opposed to direct flight from earth or earth-orbit rendezvous. Under this concept, an Apollo-type vehicle would fly direct to the moon, go into orbit around the moon, detach a small landing craft which would land on the moon and then return to the mother craft, which would then return to earth. Advantages would be the much smaller craft having to perform the difficult lunar landing and take-off, the possibility of optimizing the smaller craft for this one function, the safe return of the mother craft in event of a landing accident, and even the possibility of using two of the small craft to provide a rescue capability.
•	Mach 2.2 windowless supersonic transport A-60 design announced
by the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, England, which featured six buried turbojet engines and 73° sweep slender delta wing. The A-60 design differs from the Sud Super Caravelle being studied as a joint Anglo-French project.

•	Reported that Electro-Optical Instruments Inc., had developed an
ultra-high speed Kerr cell framing camera capable of taking six frames at a rate of 100,000,000 frames per second with exposure times as brief as five nanoseconds. Designated KFC-600, the camera may have wide applications in aerospace studies of physical phenomena such as arc and plasma gas discharge, explosive detonation, hypervelocity impact, shock wave studies, and nuclear instrumentation.
•	tiros ii was turned on late in April from unknown spurious source.
An engineering investigation was run in early May before turning it off again. An analysis of the data indicated that at least some usable IR data was obtained. It was interesting to note that the IR electronics and tape recorder are still running after 17 months in orbit. Continued operation of the satellite was not feasible because of power problems.
•	Tass reported that Soviet astronomers of the Crimean Astrophysical
Observatory discovered molecular oxygen in the outer atmosphere of Venus, using 157.6-in. solar telescope and a special spectograph. Also reported were indications of the presence of nitrogen.
MAY 1962
May 1: International Committee on Space Research (cospar) meeting in Washington received summary reports of accomplishments of 1961 and plans for 1962 by the U.S. and U.S.S.R. A. A. Blagonravov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences reported that the U.S.S.R. planned to send more men into orbit this year as well as several more unmanned scientific satellites, including one to study “the distribution and production of cloud systems in the atmosphere.”
Dr. Richard W. Porter of the U.S. delegation specified that nasa planned to launch 22 instrumented satellites and space probes during the year. During 1961, Porter reported, the U.S. had launched: over 300 high-altitude research balloons; 866 weather rockets; more than 70 larger rockets not meant to carry payloads into orbit; and 31 instrumented satellites and deep-space probes.
•	British scientists protested U.S. plans to explode “rainbow” bombs
500 miles above the Pacific test area (called “rainbow” bombs because high-altitude nuclear explosions light up the sky thousands of miles away). Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Jodrell Bank Radio Observatory, Martin Ryle, radio-astronomer, and Sir Mark Oliphant, Australian nuclear physicist, all protested the “probable” distortion of the Van Allen radiation belt by the forthcoming U.S. tests.
•	Dr. Richard W. Porter, head of the U.S. delegation to cospar
meeting in Washington, reported that the moon emits x-rays as a result of solar and cosmic ray bombardment. Rockets shot of October 24, 1961, detected x-radiation from the lunar surface. By future studies of these energies it is hoped to determine the composition of the surface of the moon.
•	Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara announced in London
that the U.S. would contribute over $30 million for the development of the stol/vtol fighter aircraft, the P-1127, originated by Hawker Siddelev Aviation Co., as part of the U.S.-British-West German cost-sharing agreement of February. This is the first agreement to develop nato weapons jointly.
•	In television interviews in New York, Cosmonaut Gherman Titov
denied reports that any Russian cosmonauts had been killed prior to the orbital flight of Gagarin as reported in the American
Sress. Titov said he also saw the tiny “fireflies” reported by ohn Glenn.
• In speech to ias-nasa Manned Space Flight Conference at St. Louis, General Bernard A. Schriever, Commander of afsc, said that if the Soviets attain a “really significant breakthrough in space technology, they may be able to deny other nations access to space—even for purposes of scientific research. . . . We must have necessary strength to ensure that space is free to be used for peaceful purposes.” Schriever said that “both the

military and civilian aspects of our space program are vital, and both must be pursued with urgency. They share a common aim—• the security and well-being of the United States.”
May 1: The Television Academy announced annual Emmy Award nominations. The orbital flight of Astronaut Glenn and Mrs. John F. Kennedy’s tour of the White House—regarded as top TV events—were not considered because they had been cooperatively covered by the three major networks.
May 2: Dr. James A. Van Allen termed the planned U.S. hydrogen bomb explosion high over the Pacific Ocean as a “magnificent experiment,” one which should bring new knowledge concerning the origin of the inner belt of high-energy protons. He disagreed with scientists abroad who object to the test as a unilateral military experiment.
•	nasa scientists reported to cospar session that data from explorer
ix indicated that the upper atmosphere was heated by sun spot activity. In 1957 and 1958, when solar activity was at the maximum of its 11.1-year cycle, air density at a height of 350 miles was 10 times higher than in 1961 when activity was nearer its minimum. This suggests that “with a decrease in solar activity the upper atmosphere becomes cooler and shrinks to the earth, so that the air density at a given altitude decreases.” Report on explorer ix, the 12-ft. inflated satellite sensitive to density changes, was made by William J. O’Sullivan, Claude W. Coffee, Jr., and Gerald M. Keating.
•	House of Representatives defeated by voice vote a bill sponsored
by Rep. William F. Ryan which would have provided for Government ownership of the U.S. portion of a communications satellite system.

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	69
Sciences, Glenn and Titov both spoke about possible international cooperation in manned space flight, Titov suggesting that the diplomats would first have to reach agreement on disarmament. Titov said that the Soviet press conference on August 14, 1961, held at Ludnicki, at which the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Matislav Keldysh discussed the rocket boosters of vostok ii, contained all useful information available on the Soviet rockets. Titov also said that the released photograph of vostok ii was of a mockup.
May S: House of Representatives passed the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 by a vote of 354 to 9, one creating machinery to operate the U.S. portion of a worldwide communications satellite system. Act (H.R. 11040) declared that it is the policy of the U.S. “to establish as soon as practicable a commercial communications satellite system ... in conjunction and cooperation with other countries ... to be responsible to public needs and national objectives, serve the communications needs of the United States and other countries, and contribute to world peace and understanding.” Act created a private corporation, one half of whose stock would be public owned, the remainder by communications companies. Three directors are to be appointed by the President, six elected by public stockholders and six by industry stockholders.
•	Soviet Academician Anatoli A. Blagonravov told the press in Wash-
ington that U.S.-U.S.S.R. talks on space cooperation would be resumed at Geneva during the meeting of the subcommittee of the U.N. Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on May 28.
•	Prof. Vassily V. Parin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences reported
that fruit flies carried aloft in Soviet spacecraft had shown a “considerable increase in gene mutations,” in a report on space biology to cospar meeting in Washington. Evident to some observers was that the Russians have conducted a wide range of biological experiments in their satellite program.
May 4- Astronaut M. Scott Carpenter and Mercury team went through complete simulated MA-7 mission exercise.
•	nasa announced appointment of Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff,
Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at mit, as Director of nasa's Office of Advance Research and Technology (oart), effective in July. Dr. Bisplinghoff, who succeeds Ira H. Abbott who retired in January, has been at mit for 16 years, has served as a consultant to more than a dozen industrial firms, and as a member of numerous dod and naca advisory committees.
•	Optical and radar observations of Project Highwater experiment,
23,000	gallons of water bursted from upper stages of Saturn test launch at 65-mile altitude on April 25, showed that the burst took 2-3 seconds to expand to about 10 times the size of the moon in a roughly circular pattern, and lasted about 10 seconds. A second fainter trail, about one lunar diameter, followed along the trajectory from the burst and lasted a few minutes, presumably caused by venting out of the incompletely destroyed second stage. Project Highwater was an msfc responsibility, a bonus experiment to the Saturn test conceived by Dr. Charles Lundquist.
•	New York Academy of Sciences conference revealed disagreements
on evidence presented on extraterrestrial life. Dr. Bartholomew
70 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
Nagy of Fordham University, Dr. George Claus of NYuMedical Center, and Dr. Warren G. Meinchein of Esso Research presented evidence, first reported last year, that they had found “organized elements’’ in the Orgueil meteorite. Dr. Frank W. Fitch and Dr. Edward Anders of the University of Chicago reported that the Fordham group found “probably nothing more than earthly contaminants such as ragweed pollen and starch grains.” Dr. Harold Urey of the University of California (La Jolla) stated that the U.S. is spending $25 billion to go to the moon to answer this and other questions. All agreed that the question of extraterrestrial life was of basic scientific significance.
May 4: nasa’s msfc completed negotiations with Aerojet-General Corp. for the design and development of the M-l engine, two or more of which will power the second stage of the Nova.
•	“Dynamic model” study on one-fifth-scale Saturn rocket at nasa’s
Langley Research Center offered useful concept for testing structural characteristics of the future Nova rocket. As reported by Homer G. Morgan, application of varying frequencies to the “Baby Saturn” while suspended as if in free flight provided clues on structural vibration capable of transmitting false indications into the vehicle’s guidance system. The two successful test firings of the Saturn demonstrated value of this research. After test of a “Baby Nova” for structural efficiency, Morgan said, construction of an operational booster could be expedite^. A full-scale Saturn model had been similarly tested at msfc.
•	Launch of usaf Titan I on 5,000-mile flight down pmr marked the

May 5: 117 members of the International Committee on Space Research (cospar) toured Cape Canaveral, and a delegation also toured nasa’s Wallops Station.
May 6: usaf Cambridge Research Lab reported record ten-day flight of superpressurized balloon at a constant altitude of 70,000 feet with a 40-lb. payload. Launched from Chico, Calif., on April 26, development ballon landed on command near Cedar City, Utah, and will lead to 20-day balloon flight experiments at a constant altitude later this summer.
•	In the Third International Space Science Symposium sponsored by
cospar, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists W. K. Victor and Robertson Stevens reported that radar soundings of Venus suggest that its surface material and roughness are comparable to that of the earth. Radar probes of Venus have demonstrated that uhf signals can be used for space communications over distances of 50-75 million miles.
•	Astronaut John Glenn and Cosmonaut Gherman Titov appeared
on abc-TV program, “The Nation’s Future.” Col. Glenn pressed Major Titov on possible Soviet space mishaps, but no new information was forthcoming.
•	afcrl scientists launched a second artificial meteor by means of
a multistage rocket fired from Wallops Island. The meteor traveled at a re-entry speed of 12 kilometers per second, exceeding that attained in the previous experiment of April 21, 1961.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	71
May 6: “American Roulette 500 Miles Up” was the title of the article by Sir Bernard Lovell in the Sunday Observer (London"), which repeated his arguments against the planned nuclear explosions by the U.S. over Johnston Island in June and July.
•	Cosmonaut Titov at the Seattle World’s Fair said that he saw “no
God or angels” during his 17 orbits of the earth.
•	Full flight test of Polaris missile with live warhead, the fifth U.S.
atmospheric nuclear test in the current Operation Dominic series, fired from submerged U.S.S. Ethan Allen in Pacific test area. Reportedly the first U.S. firing of a missile with a live nuclear warhead, the shot was described by Navy spokesmen as a complete success.
May 7: In speech in New Orleans, nasa Administrator James E. Webb reviewed the National Launch Vehicle Program, which “recognizes all the requirements of our nation in space, and includes the vehicles to fulfill them.” He pointed out that of the ten launch vehicles “in the National Launch Vehicle Program, the two smallest rockets [Scout and Delta], and the four most powerful ones [Centaur, Saturn, Advanced Saturn, and Nova], have been, or are being, developed by nasa. The four of intermediate size are adaptations of Air Force missile carriers, Thor, Atlas, and Titan.” Mr. Webb pointed out the proximity to New Orleans of nasa’s Michoud Plant and the Mississippi Test Facility.
“Now that we have crossed the threshold of space,” he concluded, “the benefits that can be gained for all mankind, the assurances to our national security that can be obtained, and the stimulus to our well-being that can be produced, are looming large on the horizon. . . . The important thing now is to make sure we are not behind in any area vital to our national security or our national leadership.”
•	nasa announced at Cape Canaveral MA-7 launching, scheduled for
May 15 or afterward, would be delayed several days because of check-out problems with the Atlas booster.
•	In Voice of America broadcast, Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen of the
University of Pennsylvania said that there is an increasing recognition of the role man can play in space exploration because “there are aspects of exploration which no machine yet conceived can carry out.” He pointed out that “the only computer capable of all functions such as remembering, recognizing, learning, thinking, reasoning, judging, integrating, reacting, communicating, and logically altering a previously programmed sequence of events is man himself.” He then reviewed the medicophysio-logical factors to be overcome for manned space flight, and he warned that “even the practicability of truly extended flight outside the earth’s atmosphere is not yet assured.”
•	Maj. Gherman Titov in San Francisco press conference continued
to chide U.S. space program. He said that if he was asked to join a U.S. astronaut in a cooperative space mission: “I would be a bit afraid because there have been quite a lot of failures in your program.” And, he remarked, the MR-3 capsule was “not even good enough for flying in orbit.”
May 8-10: Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space sponsored by nasa was held at Century 21 Exposition in Seattle, Wash.
72 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
May 8: In message to the Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space at Seattle, President Kennedy noted that the U.S. was already “working hand in hand with scientific groups of fifty nations.
“Ours is an open society and the benefits of our space program will continue to flow throughout the world. It is my hope that the Soviet Union will cooperate constructively in the proposals which we have made so that all peoples will gain in the improvement of weather observation, communications systems and the manifold output of the peaceful application of space technology.”
•	X-15 No. 2 flown at 3,511 mph and to about 73,000 feet by Major

•	First launch of Atlas-Centaur was unsuccessful; vehicle exploded
55 seconds after launch over Cape Canaveral. Flight plan called for starting 15,000-lb.-thrust liquid-hydrogen second stage at 300-mile altitude.
•	nasa selected three companies for negotiation of production con-
tracts for major components of the Apollo spacecraft navigation and guidance system in support of mit’s Instrumentation Laboratory initial development of the complex Apollo navigation-guidance system, a contract let last August. Companies selected from 21 bidders, which will work under Manned Spacecraft Center contract were: A.C. Spark Plug Division of General Motors Corp. to fabricate the inertial guidance with associated electronics, ground support, and checkout system, and to assemble and test all components of the system; Raytheon Company to manufacture on-board digital computer; and Kollsman Instrument Corp. to build the optical subsystems including a space sextant, sunfinders, and navigation display equipment.
•	nasa scientists Theodore P. Stecher and James E. Mulligan
reported at cospar meeting that “a complex series of solar events” in November 1960 caused the inner Van Allen radiation belt to “dump” its captive high energy particles along the earth’s magnetic field. This event disrupted a rocket experiment, but it detected an ultraviolet aurora with almost no visible counterpart. Indications were that the inner belt was soon refilled and returned to “normal.”
•	Edmond C. Buckley, nasa’s Director of Tracking and Data Acqui-
sition, told the Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space meeting in Seattle that jpl’s successful radar tracking of Venus over a two-month period in 1961, which resulted in a 200-times improvement in the measurement of the Astronomical Unit, was actually a by-product, though an important one, of a rigorous systems test of the Deep Space Net and of several prototype pieces of equipment that had been developed for the Net by jpl.
•	Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences reported
out Communications Satellite Bill S. 2814, which was referred to the Senate Commerce Committee.
•	U.S.S.R. turned down proposal to show friendship 7 capsule in

next month. It was stated that the spacecraft would have “no purpose in a medicine exhibit.”
May 9: In regular press conference, President Kennedy was asked whether “proposed H-bomb explosion 500 miles up” would jeopardize U.S. policy to restrict outer space for peaceful objectives only. He replied that he did not think so and that it was a matter that “we are looking into to see whether there is scientific merit that this would cause some difficulty to the Van Allen Belt in a way which would affect scientific discovery . . .
“I want you to know that whatever our decision is ... it will be done only after very careful scientific deliberation, which is now taking place . . . Generally what we are attempting to do is to find out the effects of such an explosion on our security, and we do not believe that this will adversely affect the security of any person not living in the United States.”
•	18-nation 5th cospar meeting in final session voted to establish a
consultative group for determining the potential harmful effects of experiments in space. Group of six scientists was charged with recommending to cospar’s executive council possible action by the international scientific community to sanction or condemn such experiments. Other closing actions: (1) Maurice Roy of the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris was elected President for 1962-63; (2) expressed “satisfaction at the intention of the U.S. to launch a geodetic satellite carrying a flashing beacon for international use”; (3) proposed series of coordinated rocket measurements of winds in the ionosphere from Oct. 1962 to Feb. 1963; and (4) recommended numbering satellites during 1963 by the ordinal number rather than Greek letter.
•	President Kennedy in answering a question on a uniform patent
policy among governmental agencies said that it was a “difficult problem, because you have to balance off the gains on the one hand and at the same time the incentives to companies to spend their own funds in order to develop patents ... so that we nave some differences in the space agency problems, the Department of Defense and perhaps some other agency of the Government.” He said that it was a matter now under review and if changes appear warranted that recommendations would be sent to the Congress.
•	usaf announced that it had begun negotiation with United Tech-
nology Corp. for development of solid-fuel motors for use in Titan III space booster.

systems. The pacing factor in this advance is not technology— it is management.
“. . . two stages occur in the acquisition of new systems—the preselection phase and the implementation phase . . . Not enough attention has been paid to the more crucial phase—the decision to select a specific system from a galloping technology.”
May 9: Cdr. George C. Watkins (usn) became the first man to make
1,000	aircraft landings aboard a carrier, when he landed an AD-6 aboard the U.S.S. Constellation.
May 10: mit scientists, headed by Prof. Louis Smullin, fired 13 separate bursts of light (using a ruby crystal maser) through 12-inch telescope at smooth area of the moon, then “caught” the reflection 2% seconds later in a 48-inch telescope. Ruby crystal rod was about six inches long and the red light would have been visible on the moon. Technique demonstrated was hailed as promising “a means of delivering power over vast distances to orbiting satellites.”
•	Attempt to launch Anna geodetic satellite by Thor-Able-Star rocket
was unsuccessful.
•	In address at dedication of the nasa Space Exhibit at the Seattle
World’s Fair, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson said that “our entire space program now costs each American about 30 cents a week. During the next few years we plan to spend about 50 cents a week per person on space.
“However, our space program and its by-products will stimulate a sharp increase in the nation’s productive output which in turn will increase our gross national product, our income, and the Federal Government’s intake . . .
“. . . we are hopeful of achieving fruitful cooperation with the Soviet Union in such fields as communications, weather forecasting, mapping the earth’s magnetic fields and space medicine.
“We feel that cooperation in outer space may establish a firm basis for greater mutual understanding—which in turn will help in our efforts to obtain disarmament . . .
“The responsibility to cooperate also lies heavily on the other great space power—the Soviet Union. I am able to tell you in a spirit of cautious optimism that the Soviet Union appears to realize that—in outer space, at least—there may be something to be gained by cooperatingwith the rest of humanity.”
•	In speech to the Oregon Department of Planning and Develop-
ment, nasa Administrator James E. Webb pointed out that “one of the dominant features of our age is the snort time lag between scientific discovery and practical applications.” The practical benefits of the U.S. space program would, he said, be early derived in three major ways: (1) satellites will be put to work on a global basis to report the weather, transmit messages and worldwide television programs, and to serve as electronic lighthouses in the sky; (2) in pushing our space program, we are making many technological advances which can be utilized to improve industrial processes and raise our standard of living; and (3) the money we spend on space activities stimulates business in general and our industrial pioneering in particular.

•	Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric, at Wilton, Conn.,
stated that peaceful uses of outer space was still the National goal but that the U.S. would be “ill-advised if we did not hedge our bets.” He said that a satellite interception system would get serious attention if another nation was developing such a capability. “We ought to be ready,” he said in a press conference, “to anticipate the ability of the Soviets at some time to use space offensively.”
•	Premier Nikita Khrushchev said in speech to transport workers
that despite the claims of American scientists no U.S. rocket has hit the moon: “The Americans have tried several times to hit the moon with their rockets. They have proclaimed for all the world to hear that they had launched rockets to the moon, but they missed every time. The Soviet pennant on the moon has been awaiting an American one for a long time but in vain and is becoming lonesome.”
•	In answering Premier Khrushchev, Dr. William Pickering, Director
of jpl, stated: “On April 26, at 4:47.50 AM, Pacific standard time, ranger iv was tracked by the Goldstone receiver as it passed the leading edge of the moon. At 4:49.53 it crashed on the moon at a lunar longitude of 229.5 degrees East and lunar latitude of 15.5 degrees South.” After 64 hours of tracking, the trajectory of ranger iv was precisely known and it was only 110 miles from the surface when it vanished behind the moon.
•	nasa X-15 pilot, Joseph Walker, said that film taken during recent

•	In session on the impact of space exploration on society at the Second
Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space, President Lee Du-Bridge of the California Institute of Technology said that man is limited as a butterfly: “Man is out of his cocoon [in space] . . . his life span is too short to get very far from home.” DuBridge pointed out that a flight to the nearest star would take at least
40,000	years and that a trip to Mars at present speeds would take six months, “but months would run into years even reaching other planets of the earth’s system. We are not going to accomplish space travel except to nearby planets for many generations to come.”	_ ,
•	In talk at National Conference on Peaceful Uses of Space, William
H.	Meckling, rand Corp. economist, stated that space-age economic payoffs are being exaggerated: “The exploration of space is a very exciting affair, indeed. ... If glamour displaces science in guiding national policy, however, the results may be disappointing. ...
“A communications satellite system that charges prices not very much different from present prices and that must be constantly subsidized and protected from competition, is not much of an accomplishment. . . .

It means our desire to share space for peaceful purposes with the rest of the world. And it underscores our determination to see to it that no nation is disfranchised in space . . .
“The primary purpose of our arms has always been peace, not war . . .
“Space is the new measure of our problems as well as our opportunities. The principal responsibilities for the nation’s space program are vested in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Air Force. We work together as a team, not rivals. And together we are doing the spadework for the space technology of tomorrow.
“Today, space is still free and open. It must stay that way. We can not allow it to be pre-empted tomorrow for use as a military staging area by those who hope to dominate the world.
“I believe with President Kennedy that space is a great opportunity as well as a great task. ...”	_
May IS: In address before joint American Assembly-British Institute for Strategic Studies conference at Brighton, England, John J. McCloy urged Western Europe to forego its aspirations to become a third space power and to cooperate with the U.S. in the exploration of space. Mr. McCloy, chairman of the General Advisory Committee to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, appealed to the 70 delegates that once the leaders of the Soviet Union “sensed a united position on the part of the West,
T

they are prepared to moderate their views accordingly.” When dealing with the Soviet Union on space issues, McCloy stated: “Questions of international prestige quickly emerge and we are still plagued with the almost frenetic antipathy of the Soviet Union to inspection.”
May 13: msfo Ad Hoc Evaluation Team was established for design review of the Centaur vehicle.
May 14: In nas broadcast for Voice of America, Dr. Colin S. Pitten-drigh, Professor of Biology, Princeton University, said that biological engineering for manned space flight will have an influence on theoretical physiology, but that “space technology holds far less promise of any revolution in biology than in physics.” The possibility of extraterrestrial life, he described as “the most exciting scientific question of the day.”
Optimum conditions for a manned spacecraft with regard to temperature, moisture, oxygen, and carbon dioxide can be specified. But “we have difficulty in being precise about anything else.” He pointed to the possible exclusion of heavy radiation by means of an intense magnetic field, but “can man perform normally in such intense magnetic fields?” Little is known about the reliability of algae, and new studies of photosynthesis and techniques of algoculture are needed. Rhythmic innate oscillations, previously considered superficial to the physiological architecture of organisms, are “a highly significant parameter of physiological organization.” And the possible effect of the earth’s gravitational field on normal physiological function is not fully known. Dr. Pittendrigh concluded: “Clean questions and clean answers are going to be difficult for some time. When we put organisms into space at present and detect deleterious effects, we are simply unable to disentangle the many variables that exist there and decide which has been responsible.”
•	U.S. delegate to the 17-nation disarmament conference, Charles
C. Stelle, urged early action to ban outer space for nuclear armaments: “This conference could lead to measures designed to insure that outer space can become an impetus to man’s peaceful progress and not a battleground in the future.”
•	Testimony of Feb. 27 by Prof. James A. Van Allen before the House
Committee on Appropriations on the relative worth of instrumented unmanned satellites versus manned satellites was released. Van Allen was misquoted on the wire news services to the effect that manned space flight was of limited scientific value in the future.

Pearson’s report of February 23, 1962, that five Russian cosmonauts had been lost in previous manned space flight attempts.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	79
He pointed out that the unsuccessful attempts were not orbital shot, rather were suborbital “rocket rides” such as that of Cdr. Alan Shepard.
May 15: In testimony before Subcommittee of the House Science and Astronautics Committee, Dr. Homer E. Newell reviewed history of nasa’s geodetic satellite project, which had been requested in the FY 1960 budget. In mid-1960, dod recommended the geodetic satellite program be classified, which was approved by the Unmanned Space Panel of the nasa/dod aacb in August 1960. Thus was created Project Anna, declassified at the cospar meeting in Washington on April 27, 1962.
•	nasa witnesses testified before a subcommittee of the House Science
and Astronautics Committee that Centaur rocket development administration had in recent months been streamlined. Problems in the program were attributed to too austere a budget at the start, “growing pains” of a new organization, and unexpected technics difficulties in utilizing high-energy liquid hydrogen as a rocket fuel.

May 16: nasa announced that “unidentified objects” on film of X-15 flight on April 30, mentioned by Joe Walker at Seattle, were actually bits of ice flaking off the fuel tank area.
•	Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell L. Gilpatric, in Armed Forces
luncheon address in San Francisco, stated that he was reluctant to identify dod contributions to the national space program as “The Military Space Program,” because “there is only one unified national program, not two or three or four.
“We are mindful of the stated U.S. national objective of using space for peaceful purposes only, and we [dod] support this policy completely and wholeheartedly. ... We are well advised in buying technological insurance even while earnestly hoping that space will be used only for peaceful purposes.”
Since the U.S. must avoid technological surprise in the military space area and there is no guarantee that the U.S.S.R. will cooperate on the peaceful use of space, Gilpatric announced that dod has decided to develop manned orbital rendezvous space systems for inspecting other satellites to determine intent and neutralizing if hostile, and then land at predetermined locations on earth. These would be separate, he said, from nasa’s Gemini and Apollo programs.
In reviewing the evolution of the U.S. space program, Gilpatric pointed out that the “division of labor” between nasa and dod in space was based “partly in logic, partly in pragmatic assessment . . .”
•	In testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee Air
Force Chief of Staff LeMay requested additional funds to speed the development of the RS-70. Asking for nearly three times the Administration’s budget request, or $491 million, LeMay said that limiting funds “would lose more than a year” beyond the 1967 target date for the first three prototypes. “This program has been slowed down at least four years. We have delayed and delayed until there is practically no risk in it now.”

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	81
permits a number of universities to pool resources for research and to plan complementary programs directed to the needs of the region. Industry, too, has much to gain from regional cooperation . . . beginning, more and more, to look to the universities of their region for the most important resources of the age—ideas, scientific brainpower, and advanced technological skill and experience.
“It is not a question today of whether a region can already qualify. . . . The question is whether the region is creatively doing what it can to equip its citizens to serve their area and their Nation in a period when our prosperity and our very existence as a free people depend on scientific and technological leadership. . .”

search, would retire June 1 after 34 years of Federal service with naca and nasa. No successor was announced. Mr. John Stack achieved world-wide eminence for his wind-tunnel research and conception of the rocket airplane as a research tool, beginning with the X-l and the D-558, and culminating with the X-15. He was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1951 for solution of the transonic wind tunnel problem. In 1947, he shared the Collier Trophy with Maj. Charles Yeager and Lawrence D. Bell for the X-l which made the first flight through the speed of sound. Stack also received many other awards, including the Sylvanus Albert Reed Award of the ias and the annual medal of the Swedish Society of Engineers. He was a fellow of the ias and the Royal Aeronautical Society (England).
•	In a speech to the American Ordnance Association, Dr. Glenn Sea-
borg, aec Chairman, said that nuclear energy provided the most feasible means of accomplishing long voyages in space: “To perform long-range, manned missions, it is essential that we increase the specific impulse (amount of thrust per pound of propellant) of the propulsion system well beyond the values that can be achieved with chemical combustion. . . .” He stated that a hydrogen-fluorine rocket system, now in research phase, can provide up to approximately 475-lbs. thrust per pound of propellant (kerosene-oxygen—300 lbs.). A nuclear rocket, which utilizes hydrogen (through its heat exchanger system) could provide highest specific impulse of 800 and above. He reviewed progress of Project Rover and Nerva.

•	In statement before the House Space Subcommittee, Grant L.
Hansen, Vice President of the Astronautics Division of General Dynamics and Director of the Centaur program, stated that preliminary data on May 9 explosion indicated that structural failure was caused by the “design of the weather shield between the nose fairing and the Centaur itself” and the design of weather shield “was an engineering mistake.” Design of the weather shield was based, he said, upon assumptions that “turned out to be false . . ., very difficult to define by laboratory analysis and without full-scale wind-tunnel tests.” In spite of program delays, Hansen said that the Centaur program had been subjected to “unwarranted criticisms.”
•	In answer to question on Astronaut M. Scott Carpenter’s history of
motion sickness, John Powers, Mercury information officer, said that Carpenter had no such history. He noted that Cosmonaut Titov had reported that he had only 350 hours of pilot flight time before his space flight, which compares to at least 1,000 hours for each of the seven Mercury astronauts. “Titov never saw his space capsule until 60 days before he flew it,” Powers said, “whereas the astronauts have become familiar with their capsules over a period of three years.”

May 21: In concluding lecture in a Forum series on Space Science broadcast on the Voice of America, Dr. Carl E. Sagen of the Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California (Berkeley), explained that “extraterrestrial life and the origin of life are questions intertwined.” Recent study on these issues related to four topics: (1) the origin of life on earth; (2) the physical environment of the moon and planets; (3) the present evidence of life beyond the earth; and (4) prospects for future exploration.
He discussed the chemical reactions which must have existed in the primitive terrestrial environment and produced organic matter. The critical event was the origin of a molecular system capable of synthesizing itself, and “this event—which occurred some 4,200 million years ago—can be identified with the origin of life on Earth.” From then on the long evolutionary sequence from molecule to Man was under way.
Dr. Sagen asserted that “through the interaction of organic molecules life must arise on countless other worlds, in our solar system, and other solar systems . . . [but] the forms of living organisms on other planets must be intriguingly diverse.”
Dr. Sagen reviewed the improbability of life on Venus, the possibility of life on the moon, and the “favorable” environmental features for life on Mars. It is not, he said, a closed question with regard to life on Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The presence of extraterrestrial organic matter in meteorites “greatly substantiates the belief that organic matter is an abundant constituent of the solar system.” Detailed characterization of extraterrestrial organisms likely to be found in exploration of the moon and the planets “will open up a new era, not only in biology but in all fields of human endeavor.”

•	In regular press conference, President Kennedy answered a question
on the possible U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space because of recent progress in formulating a joint proposal for the use of satellites for weather analysis: “We felt the best place to start was on weather, and any progress we can make on that would be very welcome. I must say that we strongly support any cooperative effort we could make on weather, predictions of storms, and all of the rest, and I hope it will lead to other areas of cooperation in space.”
•	In testimony on proposed Federal salary reform before the House
Post Office and Civil Service Committee, nasa Administrator James E. Webb stressed the requirements of the national space program for adequately paid scientific and technical personnel in government. He pointed out that one third of nasa’s personnel were professional scientists and engineers, one third skilled craftsmen and research mechanics and their supervisors, one eighth were engineering and scientific technicians, and one sixth were clerical and secretarial. The remainder were professional-level specialists in management, legal counsel, librarians, editors, etc.
Mr. Webb said that in considering pay raise legislation (H.R. 10480) the Federal Government must be able to compete favorably in the nation-wide labor market and that present salaries must be raised to have “reasonable comparity” outside of Government.

“As long as the Soviets remain committed to their goal of world domination, their accomplishments in space can be a potential source of danger to free men everywhere. In their efforts to bring about the complete victory of their system, they have not hesitated to use any means. There is no reason to believe that space will be an exception. ...
“National defense missions in space have certain unique requirements, but in many ways they are closely related to other aspects of the national space program. There has been and continues to be close cooperation between the Air Force and
NASA.
“The rate of progress in our space program will be determined by two factors. The first of these is research. Development of space technology urgently calls for new knowledge. . . .
“Research alone is not enough. The knowledge we acquire must be applied in timely fashion. The key to this application is management. ...”

•	In speech before the Aviation and Space Writers Association meet-
ing in San Francisco, Dr. Harry Goett, Director of gsfc, reviewed the events in the life of scientific satellites after they are placed into orbit. Once in orbit, he said, a scientific satellite “does not have striking news value. . . .
“Except for manned space projects there is no single personality on whom the spotlight can be concentrated; the job of putting together the cosmic jigsaw puzzle of space from the bits and pieces obtained from our satellites is one that engages the effort of many people throughout the scientific community; and this jigsaw puzzle goes together so gradually that there are no singular events which merit a headline. I suspect that there are Nobel prizes in the making, but it is going to be difficult to determine who should get the medal.”
Dr. Goett, reviewing the scientific accomplishments in space, said that the general public needs to understand this part of the space effort “on the basis of its real accomplishments and potentialities.” He said that this was a real challenge to the space writers.
•	In speech at the Seattle World’s Fair, Secretary of State Dean
Rusk urged that activities in space be subjected to international law and supervision before it is too late. Without international regulation, he said, “the frontiers of space might be pierced by huge nuclear-propelled dreadnaughts, armed with thermonuclear weapons. The moon might be turned into a military base. Ways might be found to cascade radioactive waves upon an enemy. Weather control might become a military weapon. . . .”
•	One year ago, President Kennedy in his address to Congress declared
the national space goal of “landing an American on the moon in this decade.”

•	At nasa news conference at Cape Canaveral, Astronaut M. Scott
Carpenter gave a detailed chronological account of his three-orbit flight in aurora 7. He quoted Mercury training psychologist Dr. Robert B. Voas, who had told Carpenter that data-collection is the “heart and soul of science.” Carpenter said: “And that’s true. Isolated data points mean nothing. We now have two data points on nearly everything. His [John Glenn’s] flight confirms jmine [and [mine confirms his . . . .”
Carpenter said of weightlessness that “there was the sensation of floating . . . Every function is easier when you are weightless. It’s the only time I’ve ever spent in that [space] suit that was comfortable.”
He reported briefly on his launch into orbit, his scientific observation, re-entry, and recovery, full scientific reports of which would be forthcoming in future weeks.

•	In an impromptu speech at opening of an Italian industrial exhibi-
tion in Moscow, Soviet Premier Khrushchev acknowledged that the U.S. had achieved “notable successes” in space and saluted the courage of Mercury astronauts Glenn and Carpenter. Commenting on M. Scott Carpenter’s MA-7 flight in auboba 7, Khrushchev declared:
“I congratulate him especially because he gave proof of great courage in a situation in which he could have been burned in his ship or drowned in the sea. All the scientists could do from the earth was to advise him to drink water and to land. But he had the presence of mind and the courage to continue his flight.”
May 29: M. Scott Carpenter Day in Boulder, Colo. Presented with an engineering degree from the University of Colorado, Astronaut Carpenter said that he hoped the degree, which he missed in 1949 because he failed a course in heat transfer, could be justified by the “unique” education in the subject received during his re-entry in aurora 7. At a news conference, Carpenter said: “All mankind stands to gain more as a result of these flights— and mark my words, man will be going to the moon and neighboring planets in the near future—than in any previous exploration in the history of the world.”
•	Before the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the U.N.
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, nasa’s Dr. Homer E. Newell of the U.S. delegation proposed that an international launching site for space research be established near the Equator.

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	95
June 5: nasa explained the reasons for the 250-mile overshoot of the landing by aurora 7, attributing most of the overshoot to a 25° error in the capsule’s yaw attitude at the time the retrorockets were fired. This caused the thrust of the retrorockets to be exerted on the capsule at an angle rather than in line and resulted in less slowing of the capsule and consequently a shallower descent curve than jdanned. This accounted for some 175 miles of the 250-mile overshoot as well as a deviation of 15 miles to the north of the orbital track. Other factors that contributed to the overshoot were the retrorockets delivered about three per cent less than the specified thrust, and the retrorockets fired about three seconds late.	_
•	A cooperative program for testing Relay and Telstar communica-
tions satellites by nasa and communications organizations in the U.S., Europe, and South America was announced by nasa.

June Ilf.: In regular press conference, President Kennedy was asked for his assessment of the U.S. space effort and “whether you plan any major realignments, such as a military role?” In answer, he said: “. . . the military have an important and significant role, though the prime responsibility is held by nasa and is primarily peace, and I think that that proportion of that mix should continue. I think the American people have supported the effort in space, realizing its significance, and also that it involves a great many possibilities in the future which are still almost unknown to us and just coming over the horizon.
“As far as where we are, I don’t think that the United States is first yet in space, but I think a major effort is being made, which will produce important results in the coming months and years.”
•	In Paris, delegates from 10 nations—France, Britain, West Germany,
Italy, Spam, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden—signed a convention creating the European Space Research Organization (esro). Denmark and Norway nave indicated their intention of joining later. Prof. Pierre V. Auger of France was named Director-General of the new organization. With an eight-year budget of $300 million, esro plans to carry out some 500 space experiments beginning with 10 sounding rockets in 1963, and the first European satellites in 1967. Launching vehicles will be supplied by another organization, the European Council for the Construction of Spatial Vehicles, which was created last March.

•	U.S. Weather Bureau announced that the formation of the season’s
first hurricane would be detected by one or all of its battery of ships, planes, radar, and Tiros weather satellites. Last year tiros hi discovered Hurricane Esther as it was forming in the Atlantic Ocean. Altogether, the Weather Bureau said, tiros iii had seen 5 hurricanes and one tropical storm in the Atlantic, two hurricanes and a tropical storm in the eastern Pacific, and 9 typhoons in the central and western Pacific. In preparation for 1962 season, the Weather Bureau arranged to transmit satellite cloud-photographs by photo-facsimile to warning centers in San Juan, New Orleans, and Miami, where they will be used in forecasting and tracking tropical storms.
•	At Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences hearing
on the Administration’s FY 1963 budget request for the space program, Dr. Harold Brown, dod Director of Research and Engineering, testified that dod is “developing the technologies which contribute to military and unmanned orbital systems able to rendezvous with satellites and then land at pre-selected locations on earth.” Dr. Brown assured the committee that dod has “no intention to pre-empt those areas which are within the proper purview” of nasa.

munications satellite systems began, with Sen. John O. Pastore as floor manager of the White House-backed bill.
•	Sir Robert Watson-Watt, British radar pioneer, said: “Even in
physics, it is undesirable that technological fools should rush in where scientific angels fear to fly,” referring to the high-altitude nuclear test planned by the U.S. Sir Robert was speaking to the 3-day “Scientists for Survival” meeting in New York.
June 17: Testimony by nasa Administrator Webb before House Appropriations subcommittee was released in which he declared that the U.S. has given far more than it has received in exchanges of space flight findings with the Soviet Union. By publicly releasing information gained from space flights, the U.S. is “ . . . cooperating with them, but not getting very much in the way of return cooperation,” he said. Webb defended U.S. policy of making space research results generally available:
“We are, in this open way, exposing the problems just ahead of us to the largest number of able minds all around the world. This is really the way mankind has made its forward advance. No one can tell from which mind comes the solution to a problem.
“I think the progress which can come from this can never be matched by Russia and the nations which do these things in secret.”
•	usaf announced launching of an unidentified satellite with an Atlas-
Agena booster from Point Arguello, Calif.
•	In an address at Northeastern University in Boston, nasa Adminis-
trator James E. Webb told the graduating class that “change and the accelerating rate of change will be the dominant features of your existence.” In discussing nasa’s program, he pointed out
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	103
that in 1961 the nine largest contractors, who received 62 per cent of nasa contracts, actually purchased or subcontracted well over half this work to 10,989 first-tier suppliers or subcontractors located in 46 states and the District of Columbia. While 56 per cent of nasa direct purchases and contract awards ($25,000 or more) went to states west of the Mississippi, the award of subcontracts so shifted the distribution that 53 per cent of the dollars were actually spent east of the Mississippi. All regions of the nation can contribute to “the full development of the possibilities inherent in the application of scientific and technical advances,” and share in “ the potential for a period of economic growth that will bring a flowering of human progress, education, and culture.”
June 17: Senator Hubert Humphrey spoke on the floor on the coordination of information between dod, nasa, and aec, and inserted in the record a memo of June 13, 1962, in which he criticized nasa’s information exchanges. He stated: “nasa has developed highly advanced blueprints, so to speak, for information exchange. . . . The blueprints are a long way from realization. . . . [nasa] possesses, moreover, in-house personnel and a principal information contractor with a very high degree of professional competence.”
•	Through the official Soviet newspaper Pravda, the U.S.S.R. asserted
that the U.S. was endangering an international program for cooperation in the use and exploration of outer space by failing to accept the Soviet drafts of codes to regulate activities in space, and by planning to undertake a program for the military use of space.
Pravda reported: The “United States thus had left the door open for carrying the armament race into outer space. It seems that American representatives have come to Geneva not so much to negotiate on the peaceful exploration of space as to justify by legal pettifogging the Pentagon’s militaristic plans in space and these plans already are too well known.”
•	Dr. Wernher von Braun, msfc Director, presented cash invention
awards totaling $1,750 to 5 employees on behalf of the nasa Inventions and Contributions Board. Award of $750, highest at msfc to date, went to engineer Billy C. Hughes for feeder restrictor for gas-bearing gyros to be used for Saturn guidance platform. Other inventors honored were John R. Rasquin and Robert J. Schwing-hamer ($500 jointly) for device that electronically measures roll during rocket assembly; Wilhelm Angole and Hans G. Martineck ($400 jointly) for an electrical cabling system; and Martineck ($100 singly) for plug and connector for miniaturized circuits.
•	In address to Loyola University in Los Angeles, Gen. Bernard A.
Schriever (usaf) said: “For the first time in history, scientific and engineering knowledge gives man a realistic means of world wide attack on the age-old problems of hunger, poverty, and disease . . . Now science has opened the way to space.
“There is every reason to be grateful for this new knowledge and power. But some have gone too far. Instead of merely accepting and using the fruits of scientific discovery, they have made a religion of science. This, in essence, is what has happened under Communism—and it has turned out to be the most false, deceptive, and cruel religion the world has ever known. It means
104 ASTRONAUTICAL ANP AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
that men and women are treated the way a biologist treats plants and animals. It is power without principle . . .”
June 17-August 10: Space Science Summer Study, sponsored by National Academy of Sciences Office of Space Sciences (funded by nasa grant), held at State University of Iowa, Dr. James Van Allen as chairman. Scientists represented nasa, dod, aec, nsf, private industry, and research organizations. Review of nasa’s space science program was contained in a detailed nas report released January 1963.
June 18: nasa selected Hughes Aircraft Co. for negotiating a $2.5 million, 6-month study contract on advanced Syncom satellite. The contract covered satellite subsystems which would require long leadtime developmental and feasibility work. Second-generation Syncom would be 500-lb., spin-stabilized satellite capable of relaying hundreds of telephone calls or several TV channels. (First-generation Syncom, for which Hughes is prime contractor, is limited to single telephone channel relay.) Syncom project is under technical direction of gsfc.
•	usaf announced the launching of an unidentified satellite with a
Thor-Agena D booster from Vandenberg afb, Calif.
•	nasa’s oso i, launched March 7, 1962, had provided 60,000 minutes
of data on its solar-pointed experiments prior to failure of its real-time telemetry on May 22, 1962. On May 15 the tape-recorded playback system had malfunctioned. Data received from oso i included information on more than 75 solar flares and subflares.
•	In extended action on the floor of the Senate, Senators Russell B.
Long, Albert Gore, Estes Kefauver, and Wayne Morse opposed the passage of the Administration’s amended communications satellite system bill (S. 2814) previously brought out of the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Senator Long charged that the Senate had been subjected to lobbying “the like of which the Congress had never seen before” on the private ownership of the proposed communications satellite system, and he was questioned by Senator John O. Pastore, the bill’s floor manager.
•	In an address before the American Management Association Forum
in New York, Maj. Gen. Robert J. Friedman, afsc Comptroller, spoke on “Management of the Decision-Making Process.” He pointed out that the Air Force Systems Command was an organization of 60,000 employees with an annual budget of seven billion dollars to administer, afsc has, he said, over 33,000 active contracts involving companies of all sizes and in all states.
Gen. Friedman discussed the “boundaries” within which afsc must manage its decision-making processes: (1) actions of the military competitors of the U.S.; (2) the constraints of limited funds; (3) the number of alternative courses available in the solution of technical, strategic, and tactical military problems; (4) limitations of time; and (5) the availability of information and competence at various organizational levels within one jurisdiction.
•	Aerobee sounding rocket launched to 140-mi. altitude at White
Sands Missile Range (wtsmr), N.M., by usaf Cambridge Research Laboratories, with objective of studying x-radiation from the
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	105
moon. X-rays expected from the moon were blanketed by much stronger source in general vicinity of constellation Scorpius. Analysis of data from sensors indicated the radiation is in form of soft x-rays that do not penetrate earth’s atmosphere below 50-mi. altitude. Data also seem to indicate the sensors may have detected a second x-ray source on the galactic rim. afcrl planned a second rocket flight for October to verify results of this experiment.
June 18: Aerospace Research Pilot School began a seven-month course to train seven Air Force and one Navy officers for future space missions and projects. This was the second space-training course given at Edwards afb, Calif., but the first for potential “operational” personnel.
•	At Seventh Military-Industry Missile and Space Reliability Sym-
posium at San Diego, Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (usaf) stated that it had become clear that “performance has outstripped reliability in a number of areas” and that this “imbalance” needed correction since “overall systems effectiveness implies considerably more than performance.” He pointed out that afsc had attacked this problem by setting up reliability offices in afsc headquarters, in each of the four development divisions, and in the three contract management regions. Representatives from each of the offices serve on the Reliability Task Force to achieve AFSc-wide focus and action. The publication of Military Specification (mil-r-27542) on “Reliability Requirements for Aerospace Systems, Sub-systems, and Equipments” replaced previous documents and as a standard section in all new systems contracts ensures the “greatest possible understanding between the Air Force and industry with regard to specific reliability requirements.” Gen. Schriever pointed out that quantitative reliability figures were being included in system inception documents (sor’s and osr’s) . Over the long term, research and training of personnel include reliability considerations.
June 19: tiros v launched into orbit by Thor-Delta booster from Cape Canaveral, faulty guidance system placing it into elliptical orbit (apogee: 604 mi.; perigee: 367 mi.; period: 100.5 min.) instead of 400-mi. circular orbit. Cloud-cover pictures transmitted to tracking station at Wallops Station on early orbits were of excellent quality, tiros v was expected to chart the origin, formation, and movement of hurricanes, typhoons, and other storms during the August-September peak tropical storm period.
•	In speech to the National Rocket Club in Washington, George Low,
nasa’s Director of Spacecraft and Flight Missions, outlined the three methods of manned lunar missions (direct, earth-orbit rendezvous, and lunar-orbit rendezvous) and indicated that a nasa decision would shortly be forthcoming as to which would be used in the Apollo program.
•	Mercury Astronaut Virgil I. (Gus) Grissom was presented the
General Thomas D. White Space Trophy by Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert, at the National Geographical Society in Washington.

with like-minded peoples of the world, the utilization of space for the benefit of men. Captain Grissom and the other astronauts are playing a vital role in the national space effort, nasa’s program is of vital importance to the Air Force. We must build the nation’s defense capability in space on the foundation which nasa lays . . .
“The feat for which he [Capt. Grissom] is recognized,” said Secretary Zuckert, “is one step, a very, very early step, toward mastery of space for constructive purposes. The American people have launched a tremendous program to acquire the capability to master the aerospace just as we have mastered the seas and the air, and kept them free . . .”
June 19: usaf brought down a research balloon after a record 19-day flight 9,300 miles from Bermuda to near Iwo Jima. Launched at Kindley afb, Bermuda, on May 31, the balloon carried instruments measuring wind direction and velocity, humidity, pressure, and temperature.

June 26: Dr. Frank E. Bothwell, Chief Scientist of the Center of Naval Analysis, Franklin Institute, received the Navy’s highest civilian award, the Distinguished Civilian Service Award, for his work on design and development of the Polaris ballistic missile. June 27: X-15 No. 1 flown to unprogramed but record speed of 4,159 mph (mach 6.09) by nasa’s Joseph A. Walker at Edwards, Calif. Record speed was achieved at 96,000 ft. on climb to an altitude of 120,000 ft. In test of X-15 re-entry stability, Walker glided in at 23-degree angle of attack, highest angle flown to date, and placed X-15 into 80-degree bank.
•	nasa announced that flight of X-15 No. 3 on June 21 by Major
Robert White (usaf) reached an altitude of 247,000 feet (46.8 mi.) instead of the 250,000 feet as first announced.
•	Thor-Agena D booster launched usaf satellite from Vandenberg
afb, Calif.
•	nasa Director of Manned Space Flight, D. Brainerd Holmes,
announced that Mercury-Atlas 8 manned flight would be programed for as many as six orbits late this summer. Astronaut Walter M. Schirra (Cdr. usn) was announced as prime pilot, with Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper (Major usaf) as backup pilot. Capsule No. 16 was scheduled as the mission spacecraft.
Holmes said: “We believe that another three-orbit mission will increase considerably our growing knowledge of space flight. Anything more than three orbits should be considered a bonus.” A four-orbit mission would bring the spacecraft down about 200 miles east of Midway Island in the Pacific, while a five or six orbit flight would cause it to land 300 miles northeast of Midway.
•	“dod-nasa Guide: pert Cost System Design,” a joint set of man-
agement principles for common use by nasa and dod contractors, was issued. The basic pert (program evaluation and review technique) was first introduced for government-industry use in 1958 and has been applied largely to evaluation of schedules and time-related problems with wide success. Since nasa and dod use virtually the same industrial base, adoption of a single approach as contained in the nasa-dod Guide will minimize differences in application of pert techniques to cost applications.
•	nasa named Charles H. Zimmerman as Director of Aeronautical
Research in the Office of Advanced Research and Technology. Zimmerman, who had joined naca in 1929 and served as associate head of the Aerospace Mechanics Division of Langley Research Center since August 1959, succeeded John Stack who retired last month. Zimmerman would be responsible for the expanding nasa aeronautical program, which supports and conducts research for national goals in military and commercial aircraft, including v/stol aircraft, supersonic transports, long-range flight at hypersonic speeds, technical support of the usaf X-20 (Dyna Soar) and full responsibility for the X—15 research airplane program.
•	Dr. Eugene B. Konecci appointed nasa's Director of Biotechnology
and Human Research in the Office of Advanced Research and Technology. Dr. Konecci will be responsible for directing research and development of future life support systems, advanced systems to protect man in the space environment, and research to assure man’s performance capability in space.
T
110 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
In announcing the appointment, Associate Administrator Seamans said: “Our success and progress in manned space flight in the next 10-20 years depend on the human research we do today. The human, man-machine and man-system requirements must be determined through research prior to the design of any manned system. The human capabilities and limitations will directly influence various subsystems of the space vehicle. It is therefore important that work in Biotechnology and Human Research be conducted at an accelerated rate, in order to have the necessary answers for the design of future aero-space vehicles.” The Life Sciences Research Group at Ames Research Center will have a major role in carrying out the programs of Dr. Konecci’s office, along with the other nasa centers and full utilization of the Nation’s military, research, and industrial resources and personnel.
Dr. Konecci was Chief of the Life Sciences Section of the Missiles and Space Systems Division of Douglas Aircraft Co. and had previously served as a research scientist at the usaf School of Aviation Medicine and as Chief of Physiology and Technology in the usaf Directorate of Flight Safety before 1957.

The X-19 is a twin-engine, tandem, high-wing aircraft with four tilting propellers mounted in nacelles at the wingtips, and is designed to cover a range of speed from 0 (hovering) to 400 knots in conventional flight.
June SO: University of California’s sixty-inch cyclotron, basic research tool that led to construction of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs in the U.S., was closed down and dismantled to make room for more modern equipment. Invented and first operated by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1939, this cyclotron was instrumental in the discovery of neptunium, plutonium, astatine, curium, berklium, californium, and mendeleevium. In addition to these seven transuranium elements, the machine also contributed to the discovery of carbon-14 and produced radioisotopes for a variety of medical experiments.

•	aec and Columbia University announced the discovery of the
existence in nature of two different type of neutrinos (the smallest atomic particle), one connected with mu-mesons, the other with electrons. Neutrinos were first proposed to explain a loss of energy not otherwise accounted for.
•	By this date, 57 nations had joined the U.S. to support the develop-
ment of peaceful uses of outer space, uniting with nasa in joint-flight, flight-support, or training programs.
•	An estimated 23,000 visitors toured Marshall Space Flight Center
during the “Family Day” observance of msfc’s second birthday.
•	Article in Soviet periodical Ekcnomicheskaya Gazeta stated U.S.S.R.
had 84 All-Union and centralized professional organs, 94 central offices of technical information at the Councils of the National Economy, more than 4,000 offices of technical information, 3,000 “homes” and “rooms” of technology at industrial enterprises, and more than 16,000 scientific and technical libraries.

•	Series of full-scale wind-tunnel tests of vtol fan-in-wing model
vehicle at nasa Ames Research Center for Army lift-fan flight research program. Part of General Electric (Cincinnati) research contract, model and test hardware were fabricated by nasa, while GE fabricated and tested propulsion systems including two lift fans, two diverter valves, and two YJ85 engines. Wind-tunnel tests proved acceptability of inlet temperature, control characteristics, transition capability, and aircraft stability.
•	Analysis of six photographic emulsion blocks carried aloft by
discoverer xviii on December 7, and recovered on December 10, 1960, revealed that inner Van Allen radiation belt dips as low as 180 miles. According to Herman Yagoda of the usaf Cambridge Research Lab., the production of star tracks and “enders” by energetic protons of the inner belt increased exponentially with altitude from 180 up to 340 miles. Thus manned space operations would probably be restricted to lower latitudes rather than high inclination orbits because it is not feasible to shield against the energetic protons of the inner belt with present payload limitations.

mph in a two-way flight at 47,000 ft. over a 15-to-25-km. course near Moscow, by Lt. Col. Georgy Mosolov according to Tass. If confirmed by fai, the flight would break record set in November 1961 by McDonnell F4H of 1,606.342 mph flown by Lt. Col. Robert G. Robinson (usmc).
July 8: Megaton-plus hydrogen device exploded at more than 200-mi. altitude, lofted by carrier Thor rocket from Johnston Island in the Pacific as a part of Operation Dominic. It was the highest thermonuclear blast ever achieved and lighted up the Pacific sky from Wake Island to New Zealand, causing some communication disruption but less than predicted. Success followed two previous attempts on June 4 and June 19. It was expected that traac satellite launched in November 1961 would be in a position to measure the influence of the blast upon the Van Allen belt.
July 9: tiros v stopped transmitting pictures from the Tegea-lens, medium-angle camera. The Tegea camera system transmitted 4,701 pictures of which 70% were considered excellent quality. The wide-angle Elgeet-lens camera, which is still functioning, had transmitted 5,100 pictures to date, some of which aided in the analysis of Typhoon Joan over the Western Pacific.

July 9: NASA scientists concluded that the layer of haze reported by Astronauts Glenn and Carpenter was the little-understood phenomenon called “airglow.” Using a photometer and other instruments, Carpenter was able to measure the layer as being 2-degrees wide. Airglow accounts for much of the light of the night sky.
•	mit’s Lincoln Laboratory announced development of the gallium
arsenide diode, capable of generating light at wave lengths in the near-infrared region. Use of this diode was expected to be useful in closed-circuit television and in communication with re-entering spacecraft, since the infrared beam may be able to penetrate the ionized plasma sheath built up around a spacecraft as it re-enters the earth’s atmosphere. Development was reported by R. J. Keyes and T. M. Quist of the Lincoln Laboratory’s applied physics group.
•	General Thomas D. White, former usaf Chief of Staff, wrote in
Newsweek article: “There are military requirements in space which this nation can fail to fulfill at its grave peril. ... I wish we would move faster on the satellite inspector and interception. We soon may need to verify what the Soviets have put into space; we may someday want to shoot it down. . . . Another intriguing concept . . . ought to have more steam and money behind it. This is the true ‘space plane.’ ”
July 9-14: Communist-led World Peace Congress opened in Moscow with more than 2,000 delegates from 101 countries attending. Purpose of the Congress was to line up as much world opinion as possible behind U.S.S.R. foreign policy, particularly in the area of disarmament.

118 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
France and Britain, while transmission was also picked up at both Andover and Holmedel, N.J., and relayed to American TV networks.
First voice transmission from space was the Christmas message of President Eisenhower which was broadcast from usaf Project Score satellite on December 18, 1960. echo i, passive communications satellite, provided a reflector for a host of communication experiments after its launch on August 12, 1960. The moon also had been used as a reflector in communications experiments, the first being a radar reflection on January 11, 1946, by the Army Signal Corps.
July 10: President Kennedy nominated Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner to be director of the Office of Science and Technology.
•	Launching of telstar marked tenth straight successful flight of the
3-stage Delta rocket. The history of Delta goes back to the Thor-Able and the earlier Vanguard, from which it acquired its upper stages. Originally designed as an interim booster when nasa ordered twelve Deltas from Douglas Aircraft in April 1959, it achieved what nasa Administrator Webb called “the greatest level of reliability of any of our launch vehicles . . . .” The following satellites were orbited by Delta boosters: echo i, tiros ii, iii, iv, and v; explorers x and xii; oso i; ariel i; and
TELSTAR.
•	nasa Langley Research Center (LaRc) announced plans to build
a cyclotron laboratory on 1,300 acres of usAF-owned land, a former Bomarc missile site, halfway between naRC and Williamsburg, Va. The laboratory will include two accelerators to generate electrons and protons of the energies spacecraft will encounter on deep space flights.
•	A U.S.S.R. Tu-114, world’s largest commercial airplane, left
Moscow on a survey flight for direct air route to Havana, Cuba. When begun, the Moscow-Havana commercial service would mark the first regularly scheduled flights of Soviet aircraft into the Western hemisphere.
July 11: nasa press conference explained basic decision on Apollo manned lunar exploration program: to base the next phase of its planning, research and development, procurement, and space flight program on the Saturn (C-5) to accomplish the initial manned lunar landing and recovery, using the lunar orbit rendezvous as the prime mission mode. Based on more than a year of intensive study, the basic decision on the lunar orbit rendezvous (lor) mode enables immediate industrial consideration of the lunar excursion vehicle and firm planning on early employment of two-stage Saturn (C-lB) to test-flight the Apollo configuration in earth orbits.
It was also announced: (1) an in-depth study of an unmanned lunar logistic vehicle would be undertaken; (2) continued feasibility studies would be made of the earth-orbit rendezvous mode using Saturn (C-5) with a two-man spacecraft, with the possibilities of a direct flight with this spacecraft; (3) continued study would be made of the Nova vehicle (two to three times capability of C-5).
nasa Administrator Webb said: “We are putting major emphasis on lunar orbit rendezvous because a year of intensive
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	119
study indicates that it is most desirable, from the standpoint of time, cost and mission accomplishment. In reaching this decision, however, we have acted to retain the degree of flexibility vital to a research and development program of this magnitude . .
lor was unanimously recommended by nasa’s Manned Space Flight Management Council because it: (1) provides highest probability of mission success with essentially equal mission safety; (2) provides mission success months earlier than other modes; (3) will cost 10 to 15 per cent less than other mode; and (4) requires least amount of technical development beyond existing commitments.
July 11: Second successful test of usaf Titan II rocket, 5,000-mi. flight from amr. Second generation ballistic missile with storable liquid fuels will be used as a booster in nasa’s Project Gemini.

British Broadcasting Company announced that French transmission violated agreement with Britain and other European Broadcasting Union nations.
•	White House Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, said that successful
performance of telstar indicated that a full study of international communications involving all concerned governmental agencies would be initiated by the White House. He said that a preliminary working paper by Tedson J. Meyers, administrative assistant to fcc Chairman Newton N. Minow, was already under study by the State Department and other agencies.
•	The Senate passed nasa authorization for FY 1963 (H.R. 11737) of
$3,820,515,520. Amendments submitted by Senator William Proxmire to require competitive bidding on space projects and to establish a presidential commission to study the impact of the space program upon the nation’s manpower were both defeated by lopsided votes. Senate authorization restored $116 million cut by the House.
•	nasa announced that Mercury Astronaut Donald K. Slayton
(Major usaf) would assume new operational and planning responsibilities.

•	Leading editorial of New York Times said, “The tendency of man’s
technological progress to outdistance bis institutions for coping with that progress is strikingly indicated by current developments in space. . . .” Pointing to the “brilliant initial successes” of telstar, it stated: “The clear lesson of these technological accomplishments is that space is now a full-fledged area of human activity for a wide variety of purposes, and will increasingly be employed for men’s ends in the years immediately ahead. Yet the cosmos today is a lawless dimension and there is no universal agreement even on so elementary a question as where space begins—no boundary line between the region in which existing national and international law bolds sway and the region in which it does not. . . .”
Editorial called for fulfillment of the responsibility resting on the space law committee of the United Nations’ Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space since “the cosmos bears some resemblance to a jungle.”
•	Walter C. Williams, associate director of nasa Manned Spacecraft
Center, defended orbital flights by astronauts that apparently are duplicates of previous flights, saying that the only way the U.S. can have a space program in depth is to repeat some of the operations. He stated that new data were gathered from each flight, replying to critics of the second manned 3-orbit spaceflight mission (MA-7).	_
•	Statement issued by the European Broadcasting Union declared
that France had “contravened” an international agreement by transmitting the first television broadcast from Europe to the United States via telstar. Under an agreement including the French, “no television material of entertainment or informative character” was to be broadcast to the U.S. before the joint “Eurovision” program scheduled for July 23. The appearance of Yves Montand and two other singers on the French transmission on July 10 was considered the case in point. In response, French officials said they had not transmitted a program but merely some experimental sequences.
•	Reported that at nasa meeting of lunar scientists the view presented
by astronomers, a geologist, and geophysicists that scientists can learn to become astronauts as well as an astronaut can make scientific observations. Which scientific discipline should be represented as a member of the 3-man Appoflo crew did not receive a unanimous endorsement.
•	Atlas icbm launched by usaf squadron from Vandenberg afb, two

•	nasa announced that two technical notes propose new concept on
the mechanics of solar heating of the upper atmosphere. Dr. Isadore Harris (TN-D-1443) and Dr. Wolfgang Priester (TN-D-1444) of Goddard Space Flight Center proposed that corpuscular radiation (i.e., solar wind) in association with hydromagnetic waves may be the energy source required to explain the results obtained from orbiting satellites. Harris’ note provided for the first time a diurnal picture of the thermosphere (120 to 2,050 kilometers above the earth’s surface). Priester’s note postulated the physical properties scientists are likely to encounter during a complete 11-year solar cycle when upper atmospheric conditions change according to solar flare activity.

July 16: Douglas Aircraft Co. reached separate agreement with two labor unions on a three-year contract, thus avoiding threatened strike of aerospace workers.
•	In an interview with fourteen American newspaper editors, the text
of which was released, Premier Nikita Khrushchev asserted that showing of documentary film on the Soviet antimissile missile to the Communist-sponsored Peace Conference last week had been overruled by those who felt its showing “might have been misunderstood” as a warlike gesture. “Had the people been shown this film,” Khrushchev said, “they would have seen what kind of a machine it is. You can say our rocket can hit a fly in outer space.”
July 17: X-15 No. 3 flown to record altitude of 58.7 miles (314,750 feet) by Major Robert White (usaf). Flight was programed for only 282,000 feet but maximum speed of 3,784 mph was 284 mph faster than planned. White’s flight made him eligible for astronaut wings, reserved for those who have flown over 50 miles high, previously held only by four Mercury astronauts. Flight was also the first to achieve the original design altitude of the X-15 of 50 miles.
•	nasa Ames Research Center reported that a number of beetles had
survived the 25-mile-high balloon flight in which the monkey and hamster passengers in the bioscience payload perished because of a failure in the life-support system supplying oxygen and heat.
•	In reviewing technical considerations leading to nasa’s selection of
the lunar orbital rendezvous mode (lor) for Project Apollo, D. Brainerd Holmes, Director of Manned Space Flight, told ars lunar conference in Cleveland:
“The mission I have described has been widely reported in the newspapers and technical journals, with a liberal use of superlatives in assessing its magnitude and complexity. In this case, resort to superlatives is well-advised—this is truly a staggering undertaking. Entirely new concepts of component and system reliability must be developed and proven. Extensive tests must be carefully planned and conducted, and results must be exhaustively studied. Crew capabilities must be developed and meshed with proven automatic systems so that the two work together with Swiss-watch precision.
“It is a challenging task, studded throughout with difficult decisions which must be soundly based and properly made. . . .
“With the decision as to the method by which we will go to the moon we think we have taken a giant step forward. Essentially, we have now ‘lifted off’ and are on our way. ...”
•	In Cleveland, Dr. Joseph F. Shea, nasa’s Deputy Director of
Manned Space Flight for Systems, told ars conclave that the manned lunar landing was greatly dependent upon information acquired by the unmanned Ranger and Surveyor payloads. The landing zone for Apollo flights (strip 20° wide along lunar equator) is about the size of Alaska. Maps of two-fifths-of-a-nnle to an inch are required, which must be based on photographs which can identify five-or six-ft. objects for navigational fixes and

initial exploration. Smallest objects now discernable in the photographs of the moon’s surface by the test telescopes on earth are about the size of a football field.
July 17: In address to ars lunar meeting in Cleveland, Dr. James A. Van Allen said that protons of the inner radiation belt could be a serious hazard for extended manned space flight, and that nuclear detonations might be capable of cleaning out these inner belt protons, perhaps for a prolonged period, for making manned orbits about 300-mi.-high above the earth. Van Allen said that the recent shot over Johnston Island was far too small and too low to have such an effect.
•	Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics,
headed by Rep. Victor Anfuso, opened hearings on the role of women in the space program. Jane B. Hart and Jerrie Cobb, representing the 13 women who completed unofficial space qualification tests at the Lovelace Foundation, testified that women had a real contribution to make and were qualified as astronauts. Jacqueline Cochran, well-known flier, said that “there is no doubt in the world that women will go into space.”
•	British astrophysicist, Zdenek Kopal, suggested in ars lunar con-
ference at Cleveland that the moon may have an abundant water supply, including geysers and under surface glaciers or permafrost.
•	In remarks referring to the editorial in the nasa issue of Aviation
Week and Space Technology, Representative George P. Miller, Chairman of the Committee on Science and Astronautics, said that “the national space program continues to fire the imagination of the American people. The spectacular space achievements are but the top of the iceberg. Underneath is a rapidly growing base of solid scientific knowledge which will benefit the Nation in thousands of different ways. The agency spearheading the massive scientific effort is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . . .”
•	In speech to the National Rocket Club, Senator Barry Goldwater
said: “I am convinced that the American people fully endorse space preeminence for the United States. This is our long-range goal as a nation. . . . Space superiority in all its scientific, technological, and military aspects is fundamental to the future well-being, security, and prosperity of the United States . . .
“As a new agency, nasa has picked up a momentum, a direction and a purposefulness directed toward long-range research and development which is one of impressive merit . . .
“From all I can observe, the relationship between nasa and the Air Force in the space program has proceeded fairly well to date. But I would point out that the Department of Defense is responsible for military affairs, not nasa. nasa is not a military service, and its broad-based program will undoubtedly contribute greatly to our own national military requirements. . . . The point I am trying to make is that the requirements of the United States for military programs in space should not be neglected in any vital aspect . . .”
•	France announced plans to establish rocket launching facility along
the Atlantic coast near Mont-de-Marsan in southwestern France. Station will be ready by 1967, when France has agreed to evacuate the rocket research center at Colomb-Bechar in Algeria.

•	President John F. Kennedy presented the Robert J. Collier Trophy,
aviation’s most distinguished award, to four X-15 pilots: Major Robert M. White (usaf), A. Scott Crossfield (naa), Joseph A. Walker (nasa), and Cdr. Forrest S. Petersen (usn). Following the White House ceremony, the pilots received personal miniatures of the Collier Trophy at a luncheon co-sponsored by the Aero Club of Washington and the National Aeronautic Association.
•	In X-15 awards ceremony before distinguished guests and Head-
quarters personnel, at nasa Headquarters, tribute was paid to the team of governmental and industrial persons responsible for the contributions of the X-15 program to aeronautics and space flight. Associate Administrator Seamans reviewed the objectives and achievements of the X-15 program, nasa Outstanding Leadership Awards were presented to Paul F. Bikle (Director of the nasa Flight Research Center) and Hartley A. Soul6 (Langley Research Center X-15 project manager) by Administrator Webb. After a short address on the pride of the nation concerning nasa’s achievements, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson (Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council and a key figure in the Congressional enactment of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958) awarded nasa Distinguished Service Medals to the X-15 pilots Forrest Petersen (Cdr., usn), Robert M. White (Major, usaf), and Joseph A. Walker (nasa).
•	Astronauts John Glenn and Scott Carpenter, and George M. Low,
nasa Director of Spacecraft and Flight Missions, testified before House Subcommittee on qualifications for astronauts. Low testified that qualifications would be raised rather than lowered for Project Apollo, that the sex of pilots had never been a requirement, but that if any resources were diverted for a woman in space effort “we would have to slow down on our national goal of landing a man on the moon in this decade.” Astronaut Glenn said on women astronauts: “I couldn’t care less who’s over there [in the next seat] as long as it’s the most qualified person. . . . I wouldn’t oppose a women’s astronaut training program; I just see no requirement for it.”
nasa had not found one woman to date who met all astronaut requirements: American citizenship; excellent physical condition; degree in physical or biological sciences or engineering; and experimental jet flight-test experience.

July 18: usaf launched unidentified satellite with an Atlas-Agena B booster from Point Arguello, Calif.
•	dod canceled construction of Navy’s 600-ft.-diameter radiotele-
scope at Sugar Grove, West Virginia, because major and unforeseen scientific advances provided better methods to acquire information. Initiated in 1954 and costing $47 million to date, the Sugar Grove dish had as its primary purpose military research in ionospheric physics, space communications, navigation, and radio astronomy. Since then, parametric amplifiers and masers revolutionized space communications, while more inexpensive acquisition methods had been developed for ionospheric data, dod decision did not affect National Science Foundation’s 140-ft. steerable radiotelescope at nearby Green Bank, W. Va., which would be used to scientifically map radio and thermal sources with greater efficiency.

July 22: nasa Mariner Venus probe launched by Atlas-Agena B from amr, the booster deviating from course at 212 seconds and commanded to be destroyed by the range safety officer of 290 seconds and nearly 100 miles high. Work immediately began to launch another Mariner spacecraft before the end of the 50-day Venus window on September 10, 1962, hopefully within several weeks if difficulty with the Atlas could be ascertained. Mariner had been planned to reach the vicinity of Venus about December 8 and to pierce the dense cloud layers hiding the surface of Venus from observation.
•	Chairman of fcc, Newton N. Minow, said on “Meet the Press”
TV program: “There are some optimists who think we can see the Japanese Olympics in 1964. I would personally think that is stretching it a bit, although the technology certainly will permit us to have a working communications satellite system within three or four years. This is the reason why we are are pushing to have legislation passed—it has passed the House and is now pending in the Senate—to determine national policy as to how the communications system will work. As always in this country technology is ahead of public policy. This time we want to keep our national legislative policy abreast of science.”
•	United Auto Workers (uaw) of North American and Ryan Aviation
voted to delay walkout for 60 days as requested by the President, thus joining International Association of Machinists (iam) which had previously accepted the 60-day delay in planned strike against General Dynamics (Convair) and Lockheed.
July 23: telstar relayed two 20-minute live TV shows, the first formal exchange of programs across the Atlantic.

Schirra from Cape Canaveral, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir from Mt. Rushmore. Three hours later on another orbit, the Eurovision program was beamed to the U.S. where it was carried by all three networks. It included scenes of Big Ben in London, the Colosseum in Rome, the Champs Elys6cs in Paris, reindeer in the Arctic Circle region of Sweden, Sicilian fishermen tending their nets, and a scene in the Sistine Chapel of Vatican.
•	In regular press conference, President Kennedy said: “I understand
that part of today’s press conference is being relayed by the Telstar communications satellite to viewers across the Atlantic, and this is another indication of the extraordinary world in which we live. This satellite must be high enough to carry messages from both sides of the world, which is of course a very essential requirement for peace, and I think this understanding which will inevitably come from the speedier communications is bound to increase the well-being and security of all people here and those across the ocean. So we’re glad to participate in this operation developed by private industry, launched by Government, in admirable cooperation.”

•	In interview with Science Service, Dr. John O’Keefe of nasa said
that pattern of re-entry of pieces of MA-6 booster rocket reinforced the theory that tektites originate from the moon. Tektites are black, glossy rocks scattered on the earth’s surface, and the wide area covered by MA-6 rocket pieces was a similar pattern.
•	Report by Dr. James R. Killian, Jr., released by the National Civil
Service League, stated that the U.S. Government is “unusually desperate” for more and better scientists and engineers. Education is not keeping pace “with the growing size of our national commitments in science and technology” and Government is being outbid by industries and even some universities for scarce talent. Greatest need, said the former scientific adviser to President Eisenhower and now President of mit, is for scientists and engineers “with managerial ability.” “Already there is a dangerous weakening of supervising technical leadership.”

138 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
August 2-8: In meeting at nasa Langley Research Center, Langley and msc personnel presented reports on space station studies to officials from nasa Hq. and other interested agencies.
August 8: nasa radiation-research balloon released biological payload near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, after 130,500-ft.-high, 51-hour flight from Goose Bay, Labrador. Two monkeys survived the flight in good condition, but four hamsters could not survive the day-long recovery operation in the Canadian wilderness; fate of the flour beetles was not yet known. The animals and insects were flown to the University of California at Berkeley for scientific study. This was the second in a series of four balloon experiments conducted by nasa Ames Research Center.
•	Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and fcc Chairman Newton N.
Minow testified before Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Administration-backed communications satellite bill. Urging prompt passage of the bill, Kennedy said it was “one of the most important pieces of legislation offered by this Administration” and that he was “perfectly satisfied it will protect the public interest.” This was the eleventh time Minow had testified for the bill, which the House had passed on May 3 and which previously had been approved by two other Senate committees.
•	Advanced Syncom satellite, being developed for nasa by Hughes
Aircraft Co., probably would carry four radio signal repeaters and could provide up to 300 two-way telephone channels or one TV channel. In 24-hour stationary orbit, one Advanced Syncom would be sufficient to link four continents (North America, South America, Europe, and Africa); three such satellites would provide worldwide coverage.
•	usaf Cambridge Research Laboratories announced that it would
conduct a series of high-altitude balloon astronomy experiments during 1962 and early 1963. Primary objective would be to get more complete and accurate information about the moon, Venus, and Mars. Scientific director of the project would be Dr. John Strong of Johns Hopkins University.
August 4- Senators Joseph S. Clark of Pennsylvania and Wayne Morse of Oregon, leaders of the Senate opposition to pending communications satellite bill, stated on radio and television interview that they still insisted the communications satellite system must be owned and controlled by the Government. However, they added that they were not committed to Government operation, and that they were “perfectly willing to consider working out a lease or a license” with at&t, rca, or any other communications company.
•	nasa General Counsel John A. Johnson, speaking before the Ameri-
can Bar Association’s Section on International and Comparative Law in San Francisco, stated: “It appears that the existing state of the law is that we have an area of space extending upward from the surface of the earth for an indefinite distance which is exclusively controlled by the underlying State, and above that, beginning at some undefined point, lies the ‘free’ realm of outer space. Whether there is or should be an intermediate third realm to which the exclusive power of the underlying State does not extend, but in which the full freedom of outer space may not be enjoyed, is an interesting item for speculation. . . .”
The problem is of practical significance, “because all spacecraft, before injection into orbit, must be launched through the air
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	139
space. Likewise, all space missions involving re-entry and landing require that the spacecraft move back through the air space on their return to earth. . . .
“It now appears that the manned vehicles which will be developed over the next five to ten years will enter the atmosphere rather steeply, level out, and glide at altitudes ranging from about 25 to 60 miles for distances perhaps as great as 7,000 to
10,000	miles before landing. Inevitably, it will become necessary to know in advance whether any portion of the re-entry phase of a manned space flight violates the territorial air space of another State because of the altitude at which its land or territorial waters may be overflown. . . .
“It would be most unwise to attempt to reach a solution to the so-called ‘boundary’ problem on the basis of the difference between the regimes of aerial flight and space flight. But even if it were possible to define a boundary between those regimes on scientific and technical grounds, it would bear no necessary relationship to the national interests which the principle of territorial sovereignty is designed to serve.
“I think it is evident that if this problem is to be solved it will be done on the basis of an accommodation of the political interests of the States concerned, and not on the basis of scientific or technological criteria.”
August 4- James A. Martin, nasa X-15 Program Manager, in letter to the Washington Evening Star clarified the method of computing mach number in high-speed flight. “Mach number is a direct function of atmospheric temperature at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. This temperature varies from day to day for the same altitude. Because of this, it is possible that the same number of feet per second at the same altitude can be more or less than a given Mach number.”
He pointed out that on November 9, 1961, Major Robert White flew the X-15 to speed of 6,005 feet per second; on June 27, 1962, Joseph Walker flew to 6,020 feet per second, at about the same altitude as Major White. However, because of differences in atmospheric temperatures for the two days, Major White attained higher mach number (M 6.04) than Walker (M 5.94).
August 4~d: Thousands of teen-agers toured nasa Lewis Research Center and witnessed special lecture-demonstrations during “Youth Days,” co-sponsored by lrc and the Cleveland Press.
August 5: usaf launched an unidentified satellite from Vandenberg afb, using an Atlas-Agena launch vehicle.
• Soviet Cosmonauts Gherman S. Titov and Yuri A. Gagarin hinted in a press interview that the U.S.S.R. would attempt prolonged manned orbital flight some time during 1962. Colonel Gararin remarked: “Recently in Japan I said that new flights through space are not far off and expressed confidence that they would certainly take place this year.”
Major Titov then added: “I also am of the same opinion and want to add that the time already is past when the length of cosmic flights will be only hundreds of thousands of kilometers. I think that flights of future cosmonauts will be more prolonged and the route of their cosmic ships will measure millions of kilometers.”

•	Sweden launched U.S. Nike-Cajun sounding rocket, first of series
of U.S.-Swedish cooperative program for peaceful exploration of the upper atmosphere, the rocket reaching 68-mi. altitude after launch from Kronog&rd range in northern Sweden. Fifteen minutes after launch, canister containing sample cloud particles was recovered; particles would be analyzed to provide information on composition and origin of noctilucent clouds.
•	Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (usaf), addressing the Society of
Photographic Instrumentation Engineers, declared development of the laser may prove more important to the world than “development of the ballistic missile, the discovery of the transistor, or the reality of telstar. ... As a new method for transmission of energy, the Laser has almost infinite potential. The Laser can direct a concentrated beam of light across great distances with extreme precision. It is therefore ideally suited for application in space. In addition, it appears to have many practical applications in research, industry, medicine and communications. . . .
“In the Air Force, our current funding for Laser technology is about six million dollars. Our efforts range from instrumentation development to the search for means of using Laser beams in support of our military space objectives. Our budget for Fiscal Year 1964 should include an increase for Laser research and development.
“The Laser is a striking example of the potential to be found in today’s advanced technology. We must make full use of its possibilities for national security purposes. . . .”
•	Senator John L. McClellan recommended establishment of a Senate
commission on science and technology to study Government’s growing scientific programs, including the desirability of a Cabinet post for science and technology.
•	Dr. Melvin Calvin, 1961 Nobel Prize winner for his biochemical
research on photosynthesis, said in interview that he was investigating effects of ultraviolet light on chemical elements basic to living organisms, in effort to discover the chemical evolution of life from lifeless matter.

•	Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, writing on the U.S. space
program in The Saturday Evening Post, stated that he did “not see the need for continuing this effort of such a fantastically expensive crash program. . . .
“Why the great hurry to get to the moon and the planets? We have already demonstrated that in everything except the power of our booster rockets we are leading the world in scientific space exploration.
“From here on, I think we should proceed in an orderly, scientific way, building one accomplishment on another, rather than engaging in a mad effort to win a stunt race.”

August 8: Special subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics conducted bearings on solid propellants. Chairman David King of Utah was quoted as saying be wanted the bearings to be detailed enough to commit dod and nasa to a definite plan for solid-propellant rockets.
Testifying before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator Thomas F. Dixon said that nasa was “giving solid rockets equal consideration with liquid rockets in decisions on future launch vehicle designs. . . . We have provided the Air Force with our requirements for an advanced technology or feasibility demonstration program on large solid rocket motors pertinent to the development of sobd rocket-powered launch vehicles.
“To make an informed choice of propulsion between liquid propellant engines (where the technology is fairly well in hand) and solid propellant motors (where it is not), it is necessary to advance the technology of large solid motors to the point of actual demonstration firings. The demonstration program we have proposed will allow us to make a wise choice between the two types of propulsions because a better understanding of costs and schedules as well as developmental problems will be available.”

mand, testified before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics that the revised usaf solid-propellant development program would cost considerably less than the $60 million originally planned. He said that current program review ordered by Secretary of Defense and nasa Administrator had shown that solid-fuel program was larger than necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of the boosters. Once approved by the Secretary and the Administrator, the new master plan for solid-propellant boosters would limit the program to feasibility study, since neither dod nor nasa had specific mission requirements for their application.
•	Speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Estes Kefauver reiterated his
belief that the communications satellite bill (H.R. 11040) “proposed the most gigantic giveaway in the history of this country. It would turn over to a govemmentally created private monopoly the benefits of hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money which have been invested in the development of space and satellite communications technology. ...”
•	Establishment of nasa Industrial Applications Advisory Committee
announced, with Earl P. Stevenson (former president and chairman of the board of Arthur D. Little, Inc.) as chairman. The committee would assist in transferring new scientific knowledge from nasa’s research and development programs to industry.

August 12: Lt. Col. Pavel R. Popovich, piloting vostok iv spacecraft, was launched into orbit (157-mi. apogee, 112-mi. perigee) at 11:02 AM Moscow time by U.S.S.R. Within about an hour, Cosmonaut Popovich made radio contact with Cosmonaut Niko-layev, traveling in nearly the same orbit in vostok iii launched the previous day. Nikoleyev reported shortly thereafter that he had sighted vostok iv, and within three hours after vostok iv’s launch the two spacecraft had completed two orbits of the earth in adjacent flight. Moscow radio announced that objective of orbiting the two spaceships close to each other was “to obtain experimental data on the possibility of establishing contacts between the two ships, coordinating the actions of the pilot-cosmonauts and to check the influence of identical conditions of space flight on human beings.” Tracking by Sohio Research Center (Cleveland, Ohio) placed the two spacecraft at 75 miles apart during vostok iii’s twenty-second orbit and vostok iv’s sixth orbit, and at 385 miles during later orbital passes. This was the first launching of two manned space flights within a 24-hour period.
•	Cosmonaut Andrian G. Nikolayev, pilot of vostok iii, broke three
records when he entered his eighteen orbit of the earth at 5:49 AM Moscow time, completing 25 hours and 19 minutes of flight time in space and more than 440,000 miles distance. Previous records—number of orbits, time aloft, and distance covered— had been set by second Soviet cosmonaut, Maj. Gherman S. Titov, August 6-7, 1961.
By 10:00 PM Moscow time, Nikolayev had completed 24 orbits of the earth (602,370 mi.) and Popovich had completed 8 orbits (186,300 mi.). Tass reported orbital data of vostok hi: apogee, 141.3 mi.; perigee, 109.7 mi.; period, 88.2 min.; inclination, 64.59 degrees to Equator; vostok iv: apogee, 145.8 mi.; perigee, 110.5 mi.; period, 88.3 min.; inclination, 64.57 degrees to Equator. Both spacecraft remained in orbit throughout the night.
•	TV pictures of Soviet Cosmonauts Nikolayev and Popovich orbiting
the earth in spacecraft vostok iii and iv were viewed by the public in Russia, Western Europe, England, and the U.S. The pictures were put on videotape or kinescope film during London broadcast for TV viewing in America.

August 13-17: Lunar Exploration Conference of more than 250 teachers and scientists conducted at Blacksburg, Va., by Virginia Polytechnic Institute in cooperation with National Science Foundation and nasa Langley Research Center. Major discussion topics were “The Moon as an Earth Satellite,” “Studies of the Lunar Surface,” and “Lunar Flight Exploration.”
August 13: Cosmonaut Nikolayev, by 10:00 PM Moscow time, had orbited the earth 40 times and had passed the million-mile mark in vostok hi. At this time, his companion Cosmonaut Popovich in vostok iv completed 24 orbits of the earth and logged 621,000 miles of space flight. Sohio Research Center calculated the two spacecraft were separated by 1,793 mi. at about 8:00 PM est.
•	President John F. Kennedy, in nationally televised address, com-
mented on the “extraordinary achievement of the Soviet Union” in double manned flights of vostok iii and iv. He stated that the U.S. was behind the U.S.S.R. in space exploration, and that it would “be behind for a period in the future. . . . [But] we are making a major effort now, and this country will be heard from in space as well as in other areas in the coming months and years.”
•	Congressman George Miller, Chairman of the House Committee
on Science and Astronautics, spoke on the House floor in acknowledgment of successful Soviet space flights of vostok hi and iv. Senator Alexander Wiley acknowledged the event on the Senate floor and pointed to need for advancing the U.S. space program.

Flight Center, was quoted as stating that Soviet dual-flights vostok hi and iv came “six months to a year” earlier than he had expected.
150 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
August 13: Soviet scientist Ram Bayevsky, writing in Pravda, said that miniaturized equipment was recording brain and eye reactions of Cosmonauts Andrian Nikolayev and Pavel Popovich. Other instruments reported were two recorders to register information when radio transmissions ceased (during re-entry) and when the spacemen left their cabins; microphones, in the form of thin rubber tubing, to register breathing; electrodes on the skin to record heart reactions and to follow eyeball muscles.
•	John Hodges, director of Canada’s Regina Observatory, said in
an interview that vostok iii and iv were orbiting in space at a time when millions of meteorites were bombarding the earth’s atmosphere in an unusually heavy concentration, and that scientists and astronomers were keenly interested in the outcome of meteorites colliding with the Soviet spacecraft.
•	Despite Soviet announcement that U.S.S.R. had developed a “new
calculation technique” for launching space vehicles as “a matter of routine,” U.S. space experts were reported to agree that the U.S.S.R. had not surpassed the U.S. in application of electronic computers to space technology.
•	nasa Manned Spacecraft Center officials commented that flights
of Soviet spacecraft vostok iii and iv would not affect programing of U.S. Project Gemini two-man orbital flights, scheduled to begin in 1964.
•	U.S.S.R. had declined the offer of U.S. networks to use telstar
satellite for relaying live telecasts of orbiting Soviet cosmonauts, said Russell Tomabene, Chairman of the U.S. joint network committee coordinating transatlantic telstar programs.
•	In an interview with Tass, Soviet medical scientist Dr. Georgi

August 18: Ten Air Force pilots emerged from simulated space cabin in which they had spent the last month, participating m psychological test to determine how long a team of astronauts could work efficiently on a prolonged mission in space. Project director Earl Alluisi said the experiment had “far exceeded our expectations.”
•	University of Maryland announced its Institute for Fluid Dynamics
and Applied Mathematics had received $18,179 grant from nasa, for work on an interplanetary space probe to measure solar winds and study interplanetary plasma (mixture of ions and electrons).
•	Reported that usaf had contracted with Westinghouse Research
Laboratories for modification for a solid-state fuel cell to determine its technical feasibility for aerospace applications and to evaluate the cell in comparison with other space power systems.
•	Construction of a new institute of medical radiology m the U.S.S.R.
was nearing completion, it wasjgeported. Institute’s purpose was to study the biological effect of ionizing radiation, the potentially poisonous effect of radioactive substances, possible means of protecting human beings and animals against radiation of all types, ways of using radioactive isotopes and other radiation sources for diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, and effects of radioactive fallout.
•	Speaking before the Lunar Exploration Conference in Blacksburg,
Va., Nobel physicist Dr. Harold C. Urey said that modern space science indicated the moon and the earth originated independently. It appeared likely that the moon was drawn into earth orbit early in the history of the solar system, some time after both bodies had been essentially formed in their present sizes and masses. He said that science now tended to disprove two widely accepted theories on the moon’s origin: (1) that the moon had been broken from the earth by tidal action, and (2) that the moon and earth had originated together in one gaseous cloud.
August 14: Soviet Cosmonauts Nikolayev (vostok hi) and Popovich (vostok iv) continued to orbit the earth, their flight paths reported by Sohio Research Center as ranging from 1,382 mi. to 1,793 mi. apart. Radio Moscow reported the cosmonauts were maintaining radio contact with earth and between themselves. By 4:10 PM Moscow time vostok iii completed 52 orbits; vostok iv, 36 orbits. Soviet government remained silent on plans to land the pair. Cosmonaut Popovich, orbiting the earth in vostok iv, passed the million-mile mark shortly after retiring, about 9:00 PM Moscow time.
•	X-15 No. 3 flown by nasa pilot Joseph A. Walker to 197,000-ft.
altitude and 3,784 mph speed (mach 5.13), in 9-min. flight near Delamar Lake, Nev., to evaluate new re-entry technique. Automatic roll damper ceased operating at 100,000-ft. during descent, causing X-15 to go into a simultaneous rolling and yawing motion. Pilot Walker regained stability with manual control and landed safely.
•	Senate voted (63-27) to invoke cloture rule on communications
satellite debate, cutting off the filibuster against the bill and limiting each Senator to an hour of speaking time.
152 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
August 14‘- Radiotelescope operators at Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, England, reported vostok iii and iv were orbiting within about 1,600 mi. of each other, as they continued their extended flight in space.
•	Reported from Moscow and confirmed by Goddard Space Flight
Center that pilots of vostok iii and iv were using radio frequencies of 19,990 megacycles, 20,006 megacycles, and 143,625 megacycles.
•	Announced that U.S.S.R. Ministry of Communications had already
issued postage stamp honoring double space flight of vostok iii and iv.
•	Five live telecasts of Cosmonauts Nikolayev (vostok iii) and
Popovich (vostok iv) reportedly were received and relayed by Moscow television when the spacecraft passed within range. Soviet heart specialist Prof. Alexander Myasnikov, speaking on Moscow television, said heart activity data received from Cosmonauts Nikolayev and Popovich gave no cause for apprehension. Pulse and breathing rates, accelerated during the launchings, were normal, and the cosmonauts had not complained of any disturbing cardiovascular activity.
•	British astronomer Zdenek Kopal of the University of Manchester
said the gravitational pull of the earth might have heated the interior of thejmoon to nearly 2,000° C. He ascribed the moon’s growing diameter and its rising temperature to constant push-and-pull action of the earth’s gravitational force, causing tidal friction within the lunar interior. The friction generates heat faster than the heat can escape from the moon, thus contributing to the addition of tens of thousands of sq. mi. to the moon’s surface and 1,832° of temperature over the last 4.5 billion years. Kopal was speaking before the Conference on Lunar Exploration, Blacksburg, Va.
•	Announced that 1962 Daniel Guggenheim Medal for achievement in
aviation would be awarded posthumously to James H. Kindle-berger, late board chairman of North American Aviation, Inc.
•	Soviet scientist A. Prokhorov, writing in Soviet labor organization’s
publication Trud, stated that study of structure of living organisms would provide great opportunities for their utilization in space exploration. He stated that the “general reliability of modern automation systems is less than the reliability of each of their components taken individually. Living organisms, on the other hand, having developed over millions of years, are much more reliable than their component organs.”
August 14-1J: Construction projects at nasa Marshall Space Flight and Army Missile Command, Huntsville, Ala., halted when 1,500 workers refused to cross picket lines of Local 588, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, protesting employment of nonunion electricians by Baroco Electrical Construction Co. District Court injunction ordered 5-day stop of strike, effective August 18, and set hearing for August 22.
August 15: In early morning broadcast, Radio Moscow announced Cosmonaut Nikolayev (vostok iii) had completed 61 earth orbits and Cosmonaut Popovich (vostok iv) had finished 45 orbits.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	153
August 15: Landing safely in Kazakhstan, U.S.S.R., Cosmonauts Andrian G. Nikolayev and Pavel Popovich had broken all records for number of orbits, miles traveled, and time in flight. Maj. Nikolayev in vostok hi had completed 64 earth orbits; 1,645,000 miles; and 95 hours, 25 minutes flying time. Lt. Col. Popovich in vostok iv had completed 48 earth orbits; 1,242,000 miles; and 70 hours, 29 minutes flying time.
•	President John F. Kennedy, in message to U.S.S.R. Premier
Nikita Khrushchev, said: “I send to you and to the Soviet people the heartiest congratulations of the people and the Government of the United States on the outstanding joint flights of Maj. Nikolayev and Col. Popovich. This new accomplishment is an important forward step in the great human adventure of the peaceful exploitation of space. America’s astronauts join with me in sending our salute to Maj. Nikolayev and Col. Popovich.”
•	nasa press conference at nasa Hq. on the tandem Russian orbital
flights of vostok iii and iv. Participants: nasa Administrator James E. Webb; Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L. Dry den; Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., and Director, Office of Manned Space Flight, D. Brainerd Holmes. Mr. Webb paid tribute to the Russian accomplishment as “demonstrations of a very real technological capacity, an ability to plan and engineer and build and fly vehicles that can carry man for extended periods of time. . . . They do have significance.” Dr. Dryden felt that the flights essentially conformed to the stated Russian objective, “to subject two men to identical space exposures, and weightlessness . . . plus . . . longer duration, which is needed to do this.” Dr. Seamans noted that “as far as guidance accuracy is concerned, what they achieved is roughly comparable to what we achieve in our Mercury flights. To me the significant element here is that on the second flight they were able to take off within a limited period of time . . . countdowns can be protracted for one reason or another.” Mr. Holmes said he was not surprised at the Russian flights: “I think we would be selling the Russians pretty short if we didn’t feel that a year after they launched a Vostok on a booster that could lift that kind of a weight, something of the order of 10,000 pounds, that they couldn’t indeed perform in this fashion.”
Asked whether the nasa manned space flight program could be accelerated, Mr. Webb answered that the booster program could be accelerated with a crash program spending another $1 to $2 billion a year. “You can get more done. It will be done inefficiently. We believe we have a program [now] that marries all of the considerations in an effective way . . .”
To the question of who would first land on the moon, Mr. Webb replied, “I think we will make the manned lunar landing and return before they do.”
As to future Russian capability, Dr. Dryden said: “there is a possibility that the Soviets can do circumlunar flight before we can. I once said there is a fifty-fifty chance, certainly no better than that, that we could do that as early as they can. It is for this reason, in fact, that our national goal was set at the lunar
97317—63---11
154 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
flight because this does require another booster on the part of the Russians as well as ourselves.
“Ever since the Space Agency has been formed we have been waiting for this other shoe to be dropped. People have told us every month, the Russians are going to produce this big booster in the next few months. Now four years have gone by and they have not yet shown us this big booster. To the best of our knowledge they have developed lighter-weight nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles rather than bigger space boosters. This is not to say that they may not be doing this. All I am saying is that they will require a bigger booster to land men on the moon.”
August 15: Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in London press conference, said he did not believe the U.S.S.R. was leading the U.S. in space exploration.
“We have been putting all kinds of satellites in the air for meteorological readings and other scientific information, ...” but the U.S. has not been indulging in “the same kind of spectacular” as the U.S.S.R.
“I think we should develop achievement upon achievement until it should be almost a matter of course for us to go to the moon, rather than indulge in the spectacular.”
•	Dr. Wemher von Braun, Director of nasa Marshall Space Flight
Center, said in Blacksburg, Va., that dual space flight of vostok iii and iv “was impressive from the standpoint of the whole operation, . . . [but] it does not look like the Russians used any new equipment. I don’t think there was a technical breakthrough. . . .”
When asked to comment on U.S. prospects of being first to reach the moon, Dr. von Braun said that manned lunar flights would require rockets bigger than any used either by the U.S. or U.S.S.R. so far. “We have such rockets under development, and the Russians also have to develop a new rocket to do this job .... Therefore I don’t think we have any serious handicaps to overcome so far as the lunar program is involved.”
•	Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Jodrell Bank Experimental Station,
England, said that flights of vostok iii ana iv indicated “the Russians have a clear space superiority in the military, if not the scientific, sense.” He urged that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. join each other in a cooperative attempt to explore the solar system with manned space ships.
•	Congratulating the U.S.S.R. for success of its vostok iii and iv
space flights, Prof. Hermann Oberth, leading German space scientist, added: “I am convinced that the Americans will soon come up with something similar.”
•	nasa announced that a second attempt to send a Mariner probe
towards Venus would be made within the next few days. The spacecraft and its mission would be identical to that of the first Mariner probe, which had to be destroyed shortly after launch on July 22, 1962, because of a deviation from planned flight path.
•	Soviet press agency Tass said that the cosmonauts traveling in
weightless state could not depend on their sensory organs for correct signals. The cosmonauts had to rely on instruments to determine whether they were upside down or not, Tass added.
•	Prof. G. V. Petrovich, Soviet rocket specialist, wrote in Komsol-
akaya Pravda that within a few decades the solar system will

seem no more forbidding than once-formidable Antarctica does today. When the solar system is conquered, man will be able to undertake interstellar flignts. Noting that the rockets boosting vostok hi and vostok: iv into orbit were 20,000,000 horsepower, he predicted that during the Twentieth Century rocket liners would be built with engine capacity greater than 1,000,000,000 horsepower.
August 15: Walter L. Lingle, Jr., was appointed Assistant Administrator for Management Development, nasa.
•	nasa announced that its Goddard Space Flight Center had awarded
three three-month study contracts for design of an Advanced Oso (orbiting solar observatory) satellite, to be launched into polar orbit during 1965. Advanced Oso would aid development of method of predicting solar flares. Contractors were Republic Aviation Corp., Space Technology Laboratories, and Ball Brothers Research Corp.
•	Announced that nasa had awarded contract to Rocketdyne Division
of naa for two-year continuation of H-l engine research and development. Preliminary letter contract of $700,000 was signed toward estimated $9,000,000 total cost. H-l engine is used in clusters of eight to power S-I stage of Saturn C-l launch vehicle.
During mid-August: Chandler Ross, Aerojet-General Corp. Vice President, told House Committee on Sciences and Astronautics that two Aerojet concepts of recoverable/reusable boosters compared favorably to cost and capability of Saturn C-5. One concept was Sea Dragon two-stage unmanned vehicle with payload capability “well in excess” of a million pounds; and the other was Astroplane single-stage manned vehicle with payload capability of about 550,000 pounds. “In each case the incremental cost savings is of sufficient magnitude to warrant continued feasibility studies of these systems,” Ross said.
August 16: Adlai E. Stevenson, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., stated in letter to the Senate that the communications satellite bill “provides the President and the executive branch of this Government with adequate control and influence to ensure that the instrument proposed here can be fitted or adapted to an international system when we learn enough to design one.”
•	D. Brainerd Holmes, nasa Director of Manned Space Flight, said
that Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr., probably would make his orbital flight (MA-8) the middle or end of September. Speaking at the Lunar Exploration Conference in Blacksburg, Va., Mr. Holmes made it clear that the success of recent Soviet prolonged manned space flights would not change the six-orbit mission of Commander Schirra.
•	H.R. 12812, bill to amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act
of 1958 regarding property rights in inventions by private companies under nasa contract, was reported from the House Committee on Science and Astronautics.
•	dod activated nrl’s huge radar system near Chesapeake Beach,
Md. Central feature of system was 150-ft.-diameter antenna, capable of obtaining signals from small aircraft or satellites from as far as 1,200 miles away and of receiving very strong signals from the moon (240,000 miles away). Radar would be used solely for research purposes.

August 16: Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal Rodin Malinovsky, declared in message to Cosmonauts Nikolayev and Popovich published in Krasnaya Zvezda: “Let our enemies know what techniques and what soldiers our Soviet power disposes of.”
•	S-IV stage of Saturn C-l launch vehicle was successfully static-
fired for first time in 10-sec. test at Sacramento, Calif., facility of Douglas Aircraft Co. First flight test of the liquid-hydrogen/ liquid-oxygen-powered upper stage would be made in 1963. August 17: U.S. Senate passed Administration communications satellite bill (66 to 11 vote), ending 20-day debate and liberal bloc opposition which had invoked seldom-used anti-filibuster rules. Bill was returned to the House, which had previously passed a slightly different version.
•	nasa selected Dalmo-Victor Co. and Amelco, Inc., to negotiate for
r&d and production services for initial systems of Satan (satellite automatic tracking antenna). New antenna system would orient itself automatically to orbiting spacecraft and would be a major improvement in nasa’s worldwide Minitrack system.
•	nasa Administrator James E. Webb announced appointment of Dr.
Howard S. Turner to the Industrial Applications Advisory Committee. Dr. Turner was vice president for r&d of Jones & Laugh-lin Steel Corp. and formerly president and a director of Industrial Research Institute.
•	dod spokesmen considered there was nothing in the space flights of
vostok iii and iv that dod had not anticipated, and that the double flight appeared to have no immediate military significance.
•	In joint interview of Cosmonauts Nikolayev and Popovich pub-
lished in Soviet newspaper Izvestia, Major Nikolayev stated: “In an unstrapped condition in the cabin I carried out communications and ate. In a condition of weightlessness one can live and work completely. ... In accordance with the schedule, we got up, conducted scientific work, maintained communications with the earth, made new entries in the flight log. We also had a special time for rest. In general, we worked and lived just as we do at home.”
Lt. Col. Popovich said that there had been a lot of work to do in collecting the maximum amount of scientific data. . . . “We were not idle.”
•	Reported that launch of NASA’s second Mariner Venus probe would
be delayed until August 26 or later, because of “unusual” failures in rocket’s guidance equipment revealed during prelaunch checkout at Cape Canaveral.
•	Navy’s Polaris A-2 missile, testing components for A-3 version,
exploded a few seconds after launching at Cape Canaveral.
•	Seven newspaper pages were transmitted by facsimile from Westrex
Corp. laboratories, New York; to Andover, Maine; to telstar satellite; and back in successful 12-minute communications experiment.
•	Announced that American Cable & Radio Corp., subsidiary of
it&t, would conduct the first experiments in sending teletype messages between the U.S. and Great Britain via telstar communications satellite. Tests would be made between August 20 and September 7, in cooperation with at&t and British Post Office Department.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	157
August 17: British Air Ministry announced that three U.S. Lockheed U-2 aircraft would be stationed at raf station at Upper Heyford, England, to conduct high-altitude weather research and atmospheric sampling for radioactive dust in flights over international waters in the North Atlantic area. Announcement said that results of studies would be published and would contribute to the work of technical committees of the United Nations.
August 18: Massive celebration in the Kremlin on Soviet Air Force Day as the new Russian space heroes, Cosmonauts Major Andrian Nikolayev and Lt. Colonel Pavel Popovich, were feted. In round of speech making, Premier Nikita Khrushchev welcomed the cosmonauts and their families, awarded them “Hero of the Soviet Union” medals, and said: “We are gathering new strength to surprise the world with our discoveries and victories.” He also demanded that the Western Allies get out of Berlin.
•	U.S.S.R. launched cosmos viii into orbit. Reported preliminary
orbital data: perigee, 159 mi.; apogee, 375 mi.; inclination, 49° to Equator; period, 92.9 min.
•	Norway, in cooperation with Denmark and the U.S., launched its
first ionosphere probe from Andoeya, Norway, the probe reaching altitude of about 100 km. to measure electron density and collision frequency in the ionosphere. Under arrangements between the Norwegian Committee for Space Research, nasa, and the Royal Technical University of Copenhagen, Denmark, the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment designed and fabricated the instrument equipment. For this and future launchings, Norway was assembling and launching Nike-Cajun rockets, purchased in U.S. under nasa sponsorship, nasa personnel and equipment supported telemetry operations. Results of flight would be compared with data obtained from past and future probes launched at nasa Wallops Station in Norway-U.S. cooperative program.
•	Reported that Secretary of Defense McNamara was not surprised
by the Soviet double-orbiting of vostok iii and iv, and that he did not consider the flights as cause for changing the U.S. military space program.
•	Senator Wiley of Wisconsin urged that Congress before adjourn-
ment conduct hearings on the military implications of U.S.S.R. two-man orbital space flights.
•	Dr. Carl Sagan, University of California astronomer, warned scien-
tists at the Lunar Exploration Conference, Blacksburg, Va., of the need for sterilization of lunar spacecraft and decontamination of Apollo crewmen, pointing out that lunik ii and ranger iv probably had deposited a million terrestrial micro-organisms on the moon, possibly contaminating areas around the impact points. Even more serious, he said, was the possibility that lunar microorganisms might be brought to earth where they could multiply explosively.
•	Washington Evening Star reported that usaf had orbited or at-
tempted to orbit 24 unmanned, unidentified satellites since autumn 1961 when dod adopted its policy of not issuing details of satellite launchings.
158 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
August 19: National Aviation Day, commemorating the birth in 1871 of Orville Wright in Dayton, Ohio.
•	nasa launched Scout vehicle from Wallops Island in flight experi-
ment to make direct measurements of radiative heating during atmospheric entry.

•	In nbc TV interview, Dr. F. J. Krieger, specialist of the rand
Corporation on Soviet space affairs, pointed out that the 50th anniversary of the Communist Revolution in Russia was in 1967, and that that year may be the political target date for the accomplishment of a Soviet lunar landing mission.
August 20: Senator Howard W. Cannon spoke on the Senate floor on the need for an enlarged military space program. “. . . the major emphasis being placed by present U.S. space efforts has been on the purely scientific exploration of space and on its civilian applications, in priority above and indeed to the detriment of development of vitally needed military capabilities in space. If continued, this could prove to be a fatal mistake .... Unfortunately the present direction of our national efforts in space gives little or no assurance that attention is truly directed to the development of our military capabilities .... Clearly, we ought to have an energetic development program underway, adequately supported with funds, to find means to defend ourselves against attacks that could come from hostile orbiting space vehicles.”
Senator Cannon listed several “minimum essential required space capabilities:” (1) near-space operations using manned maneuverable vehicles “capable of self-defense and having the capability of conducting offensive, defensive, and passive support missions;” (2) a standard military-civilian space launch system; (3) unmanned satellites for military communications missions; (4) improved tracking, control, and detection facilities (5) space-located facilities for r&d; (6) space-located bioastronautics research by means of a manned orbiting satellite.
•	X-15 No. 2 flown to 3,433 mph speed (mach 5.22) and 87,000-ft.
altitude by Maj. Robert Rush worth (usaf), the roll damper failing three times and forcing pilot Rushworth to rely on the backup system. Electronic malfunction did not interfere with flight’s primary mission: to chart aerodynamic heating rates at relatively high airspeeds and moderate angles of attack.
•	dod-aec jointly announced they were making a detailed study with
nasa to determine possible effects of new radiation belt created by U.S. high-altitude nuclear blast on July 8, 1962, on manned orbital space flights. Preliminary study showed new belt was 400 mi. wide and 4,000 mi. deep, stretching around the earth above the geomagnetic equator. Government scientists stated the belt had lost half its radioactivity over a 2-3 week period and predicted the decay would be more rapid at lower altitudes than at higher ones.
•	D. Brainerd Holmes, nasa Director of Manned Space Flight, stated
in press interview that the recently-created radiation belt had not altered plans for Project Mercury manned flight MA-8. “We
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	159
don’t have enough data on this. We are looking at this thing, but until we have looked at it a lot more completely, I would not like to see us change our. plans.”
August 20: dod announced plans to develop Titan III launch vehicle powered by both solid and liquid rocket fuels and capable of thrust greater than 2.5 million pounds. To become operational by 1965, Titan III would be used primarily to launch X-20 (Dyna Soar) manned spacecraft as well as heavy military satellites. Martin-Marietta Corp. was selected as prime contractor for Titan III, to cost between $500 million and $1 billion.
•	Soviet scientist A. Mikhailov, writing in Pravda, reported twin
space flights of Maj. Andrian Nikolayev and Lt. Col. Pavel Popovich apparently proved that “normal and corpuscular radiation” presented no danger to space travelers unless it was “catastrophically intensified” and that the chances of harm from large meteorites were “rather slight.”
August 21: Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, in news conference, stated that U.S.S.R. was “substantially ahead” in some phases of military space development but the U.S. was acting to overtake the lead. Confirming reports that dod space budget would not be increased, McNamara added: “Lest you interpret that as an indication that the Russian flight was not a great one, or lest you interpret it as my belief that the Russians didn’t do anything we couldn’t do, let me hasten to add that we have not accomplished what they have accomplished to date.
“We are behind in certain space developments, particularly those associated with large booster capabilities.”
He cited development of Titan III booster as a major step toward overtaking the Soviet Union. Titan III would have between two and three times the thrust of the Soviet boosters used to launch manned Vostok satellites. Secretary of Defense McNamara stated that dod FY 1964 funding would include increases for development of 120-in., 156-in., and 260-in. solid-propellant rocket motors. 120-in. motors would be used in Titan III launch vehicles.
•	Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg, in telegram message, told
unions involved in strike at nasa Marshall Space Flight Center it was “imperative” that union members “return to work immediately and remain at work.”
•	Astronaut M. Scott Carpenter, at nasa Manned Spacecraft Center
conference on Project Mercury flight MA-7, stated that his May 24 orbital space flight demonstrated there was no problem associated with prolonged drifting flight, a procedure necessary in future long-duration space flights. Reporting on re-entry and landing, he said that his preoccupation with floating particles in space consumed time available for stowing loose gear, so that his attention to last-minute stowing and to difficulties in horizon pitch scanner circuit, coupled with shift to manual control of retrofire, resulted in 3-sec. delay of retrofire and 250-mi. overshoot of target landing point.
•	Soviet cosmonauts held news conference in Moscow, revealing they
had parachuted to earth from their space capsules, landing about 124 mi. apart. Maj. Nikolayev reported that he and Col. Popovich had unstrapped themselves and floated weightless in
160^ ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
their cabins for an hour, maintaining communications with each other at the same time. He also stated that the flight program had not called for rendezvous of vostok iii and iv, and that the closest the two capsules had come to each other was 5 kilometers (a little over 3 mi.).
Col. Popovich reported they both had observed the glowing particles seen by Cosmonauts Gagarin and Titov and by U.S. Astronaut John Glenn. Popovich said they believed the particles had been “merely the exhaust of the rocket motors.”
It was stated that the results of the cosmonauts’ flights would be published after the collected data had been processed.
August 21: In response to statement by Col. Gen. Pyetr Braiko, Soviet Air Force chief of staff, regarding U.S.S.R. lead over U.S. in aircraft records, National Aeronautic Association president Martin M. Decker announced that Soviet claim was based on January 1, 1961, figures. At that time, U.S.S.R. held 176 world records— 113 aircraft, and 63 parachute; U.S. held 106 world records—all aircraft. By July 20, 1962, U.S.S.R. still led U.S. in total world records (including parachute), but U.S. held more aircraft records than U.S.S.R. Parachute records: 83 U.S.S.R. to 8 U.S.; aircraft records: 112 U.S.S.R. to 161 U.S.
August 22: In regular press conference, President Kennedy announced that the U.S.S. Skate and U.S.S. Seadragon, nuclear-powered submarines based in different oceans, had made underwater rendezvous beneath the ice at the North Pole.
In answer to questions on the present and future significance of the flights of vostok iii and iv, President Kennedy said: “Well, we are second to the Soviet Union in long-range boosters. I have said from the beginning—we started late; we’ve been behind. It’s a tremendous job to build a booster of the size that the Soviet Union is talking about, and also of the much larger size which we're presently engaged in in the Saturn Program.
“So we are behind. We’re going to be behind for a while. But I believe that before the end of this decade is out, that the United States will be ahead. But it’s costing us a tremendous amount of money. We’re putting a tremendous effort in research and development; but we just might as well realize that when we started—we started late.
“Last year, as you know, we made a decision to go to the moon, with bipartisan support, and it’s going to take us quite a while to catch up with a very advanced program which the Soviets are directing . . . thereV no indication the Soviets are going to quit ....
“But we’re in for some further periods when we’re going to be behind. And anybody who attempts to suggest that we’re not behind misleads the American people—we’re well behind—-but we are making a tremendous effort.
“We increased, after I took office, after four months, we increased the budget for space by 50 per cent over that of my predecessor. The fact of the matter is that this year we submitted a space budget which was greater than the combined eight space budgets of the previous eight years ....
“. . . we are spending for military purposes in space three times what we were in 1960—about $1,500,000,000. The two,
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	161
at least at present, the two important points that should be kept in mind are the ability to build a large booster which can put a large satellite into atmosphere. That is being done, nasa is doing that, though there has been, of course, under Titan III contract, a booster program for the military.
“In addition, the guidance, navigation, etc., that’s extremely important. That we are making a major effort in. And so that I recognize that there are those who oppose this program and then suddenly a month later say we ought to suddenly go ahead on a different basis.
“The fact of the matter is that 40 per cent of the R and D funds in this country are being spent for space. That’s a tremendous amount of money and a tremendous concentration of our scientific effort.
“I’m not saying that we can’t always do better. But I think the American people ought to understand it’s billions of dollars we’re talking about which I believe a month ago a prominent— mentioned as a great boondoggle.
“I think it’s important, vital and there is a great interrelationship between military and peaceful uses of space. But we’re concentrating on the peaceful use of space which will also help us protect our security if that becomes essential. . .

•	First attempted live radio broadcast between U.S. and Europe via
telstar satellite was unsuccessful because of failing radio connections between Boston broadcasting station and Andover, Maine, relay station. Boston station received, but could not understand, Swedish message; Sweden station did not receive message from Boston, telstar performed perfectly, however.
•	Two new sources of radiation in the Milky Way bad been discovered
by usaf Aerobee probe on June 18, physicist Riccardo Giacconi announced at Third International Symposium on X-Ray Optics and X-Ray Microanalysis, Stanford University. Giacconi said that knowledge of x-ray emissions was valuable because this kind of radiation was “intimately connected with the creation and behavior of cosmic rays and the properties of a galaxy. . . .” Discovery and investigation of such x-rays would “further understanding of the origin and dynamics of the universe . . . and may have a bearing on the study of communication of matter between galaxies.” A second probe was planned for launch on October 2, to investigate the discoveries.
•	Soviet Cosmonaut Pavel R. Popovich, in an interview on Moscow
television, was asked if be bad seen God in space during bis recent orbital flight in vostok iv, and be replied: “Yes, I can confirm this. I have seen God. I asked bis surname and be replies, ‘Nikolayev, Andrian Grigorevich.’ ”
August 2^: Speaking on the floor of the Senate, Senator Thomas Dodd supported statements by Senator Cannon on August 20, and added: “The primary goals of our foreign policy, as I see it, are first, the protection of our Nation; second, the maintenance and extension of freedom; and third, the preservation of peace. . . . Our ability to protect our freedoms and preserve the peace depends ... on our military power in-being—on land, on sea, in the air and, tomorrow, in space. ...
“I earnestly hope that it will prove possible to maintain our scientific space program and our moon program intact while instituting an immediate program to bolster our flagging military effort in space. . . .
“The reorganization of our space effort will require a number of changes. First, and preceding everything else, there must be a change in policy, which clearly and publicly assigns a greater emphasis to the military potentialities of space. . . .
“Second, there must be a specific directive to the Defense Department to proceed as a matter of the utmost urgency with the development of military space systems, in particular of manned space vehicles . . .
“Third, I believe that while proceeding with the development of specialized military spacecraft, our Military Establishment should be authorized to embark immediately on a launching program of its own for manned space vehicles, perhaps employing
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1982	163
modified versions of the equipment now under development by
NASA. . . .
“Fourth, to support the establishment of military launching and vehicle development programs, our astronaut training program will have to be stepped up, and military personnel will have to be trained in the use of the complex monitoring and control systems that constitute the brain of our entire space vehicle effort.
“Fifth, our defense program in space will have to be provided with whatever money may be necessary to achieve its objectives, and to overtake the Soviet lead in manned space vehicles.
“Sixth, the machinery of cooperation Detween nasa and Defense will have to be overhauled in a manner which gives due consideration to the requirements of defense as well as to the requirements of science. . . .”
August 2J+: nasa issued proposal requests to 23 industrial firms for research, development, delivery, and installation of two separate shock-heating, free-flight wind tunnel structures and gun development facilities. Proposals were due at nasa Ames Research Center by September 17.

•	Astronomers released photographs of the Humason comet in recent
collision with solar wind of magnetic particles. Jesse L. Green-stein of Mt. Wilson and Palomar observatories said: “When comets are close to the sun, the disintegrating effects of solar radiation can be observed on them. This is the first time such effects have been observed at anywhere near this distance from the sun.” Humason comet was about 240 million miles from the sun, traveling in a solar orbit billions of miles long.
•	Congressman George P. Miller, Chairman of House Committee on
Science and Astronautics, said in press interview that the greatest accomplishment of Soviet vostok iii and iv flight was putting two men in orbit and bringing them close together. “They’re well ahead in that respect. But we can meet that in a couple of years. We’ll be ahead when Titan 3 is ready.”
•	aec announced two U.S.S.R. nuclear tests in the atmosphere had

164 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
August 27: Atlas-Agena B vehicle boosting mariner ii Venus probe launched from Cape Canaveral at 2:53 AM edt, the Atlas boosting its load to about 115 mi. and then the Agena B igniting to project it into parking orbit. About half an hour after launch the Agena B engines reignited, accelerating the probe’s speed from
18.000	mph to 25,551 mph, when it escaped earth’s gravitational pull and flew into deep space.
Shortly after launch, scientists reported that “normal dispersions” in launch vehicle engines would cause the probe to fly not more than 600,000 mi. from the planned point of intersection with orbit of planet Venus. Later calculations pinpointed the deviation at 250,000 mi., a distance that could be corrected by radio signals within a few days. After 109-day flight covering
180.200.000	mi., mariner ii would come within 10,000 mi. of Venus on fly-by mission. Instrumentation aboard the 447-lb. craft included a microwave radiometer to determine the surface temperature of Venus and details of its atmosphere; an infrared radiometer to determine fine structure of cloud layers; a magnetometer to measure changes in Venusian and interplanetary magnetic fields; ion chamber and particle flux detector to measure charged-particle intensity and distribution in interplanetary space and vicinity of Venus; cosmic dust detector to measure density and direction of cosmic dust; and solar plasma spectrometer to measure intensity of low energy protons from the sun.
•	House approved Senate version of communications satellite bill
(H.K. 11040) in vote of 371-10, under suspension of House rules to permit neither further changes nor conference on the measure. The bill, which would establish a corporation responsible for U.S. commercial communications satellites, was sent to the White House.
•	Senate Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 12711, Inde-
pendent Offices Appropriation Bill for FY 1963, restoring $77.5 million to nasa authorization for FY 1963. Committee recommendations: $2,917,878,000 for research, development, and operation; $786,237,000 for construction of facilities; and $35,000 for general provisions. (Total $3,704,150,000.)
•	Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of England’s Jodrell Bank Experi-
mental Station which was tracking mariner ii, reportedly said that the Venus probe appeared destined to become the world’s most successful space effort to date.
•	Subcommittee on construction of President Kennedy’s Missile Sites
Labor Commission conducted closed hearing on recent 10-day work stoppage at nasa Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala. Although electricians and other construction workers had returned to work, the basic labor dispute—union members’ stopping work on vital U.S. missile and space projects because of employment of nonunion members—remained to be settled.
•	Announced that Anna 1-B geodetic satellite would not be launched
until October because recently-created radiation belt might adversely affect Anna’s solar cells. Previously scheduled for August 14 launch, satellite would orbit in 600-mi. circular path where radiation of new belt reached peak intensity. Also reportedly
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	165
postponed was launching of Canada’s S-27 Alouette satellite, planned for 625-mi. circular polar orbit. Center of peak electron intensity in the new belt had shifted from 16,000 mi. above the earth to 700 mi. Since its creation, the belt had decreased in intensity by about one half; scientists expected the radiation would soon be dissipated.
August 27: dod announced that telstar was being used to synchronize master clocks in England and the U.S. Accuracy of 10 millionths of a second was obtained in first demonstration when stations at Andover, Maine, and Goonhilly Downs, England, simultaneously sent time-check signals via telstar, on August 25.
•	Soviet Cosmonaut Andrian G. Nikolayev, interviewed on Moscow
television, indicated that although he and Cosmonaut Pavel R. Popovich had parachuted to earth from vostok iii and vostok iv, “if we had been ordered to land in the ship we would have done this. It is very easy to land in the ship.” When asked why they and Cosmonaut Gherman Titov (vostok ii) had all landed by parachute, Maj. Nikolayev replied that they all were very fond of parachute jumping.
•	nasa Goddard Space Flight Center (gsfc) announced it was train-
ing Italian scientists and engineers for the launching of Italy’s first satellite. The 165-lb. satellite would be launched by 1965 from platform in Indian Ocean off eastern coast of Africa.
•	Reported that dod was “taking steps toward developing the Nike-

•	nasa reported that power output of orbiting satellites ariel i,
transit iv-b, and traac dropped after U.S. high-altitude nuclear blast on July 8, the energetic particles created by explosion damaging the satellites’ solar cells and thereby reducing their ability to convert sunlight into electricity. Many satellites, including telstar, showed no signs of damage from radiation. telstar’s solar cells survived because they were specially designed to withstand radiation in the Van Allen belts.
•	Speaking at meeting of American Institute of Biological Sciences in
Corvallis, Ore., James C. Finn, Jr., of North American Aviation, predicted a permanent moon base would be established before 1990. He said the base would be dug at least 40 ft. underground to protect crew from bombardment by meteors and radiation and from temperature extremes between day and night.
August 29: Radio signals from Johannesburg, South Africa, activated four observation instruments on the mariner ii space probe. Transmitted data would be evaluated by Cal Tech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (jpl).

nauts John Glenn and Alan Shepard would join U.S.S.R. Cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin, Gherman Titov, Andrian Nikolayev, and Pavel Popovich at International Astronautical Congress in Bulgaria, September 23 to 29.
August 30: Dr. Brian O’Brian, State University of Iowa physicist, predicted in interview that the new radiation belt created by July 8 high-altitude nuclear blast could last for many months— possibly as long as a year. He added that only a major sun-spot storm would eradicate all traces of the band before mid-1963, and such a storm was unlikely. An associate of Dr. James A. Van Allen, Dr. O’Brian based his prediction on data from orbiting Injun satellite which he had been studying for the past month.
•	Dr. Morris Tepper, nasa Director of Meteorological Systems, told
subcommittee of House Committee on Science and Astronautics that he doubted the launch schedule for first Nimbus satellite could be accelerated and stated that the Nimbus program had never been considered “urgent.”

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	167
August SI: James E. Webb, nasa Administrator, was awarded the McCurdy Medal, honoring nasa for “outstanding contributions to the world in the field of science,” at the Canadian International Air Show, Toronto.
•	Senate passed FY 1963 appropriations bill (H.R. 12711) as amended,
giving nasa $3,704,115,000 for FY 1963. This amount represented $60,115,000 restoration of funds cut by House in its appropriation of $3,644,115,000 for nasa in FY 1963.
•	Soviet Cosmonauts Andrian G. Nikolayev and Pavel R. Popovich
described their re-entry in vostok iii and iv, in Pravda article. Their experience was “probably one of the most tremendous impressions in life. . . . Our antennas charred, the [radio] connection between the earth and the spaceships stopped. We did not close the shields over the portholes and watched with curiosity, from behind the heat-proof glass, flames that raged in different colors alternating from blue to dark red.”
•	NASA-supplied Nike-Cajun sounding rocket launched by Swedish
Committee of Space Research at Kronog&rd, Sweden, in experiment to study auroral event in progress, the rocket performing as predicted but payload failing to separate.
•	Levitt Luzern Custer, pioneer balloonist and member of the Early
Bird Club, died at 74 in Dayton, Ohio. In 1909, Custer’s first balloon flight set record for longest flight of free balloon in an hour’s time, from Dayton to Middletown, Ohio.
•	Vincent Johnson, nasa Centaur program manager, reportedly said
nasa would spend an additional $33 million to accelerate slipping Centaur launch vehicle development, nasa would divert funds from other programs rather than request supplement from Congress.
During August: First full-scale model of 3-man Apollo spacecraft underwent preliminary ocean drop-testing off California coast and was shipped to nasa Manned Spacecraft Center for further testing. J. Thomas Markley, Apollo project engineer for nasa, described all spacecraft structural tests thus far as “successful.”
•	Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, Director of nasa Manned Spacecraft Center,
presented details of Apollo spacecraft at Institute of the Aerospace Sciences (ias) meeting in Seattle. During launch and re-entry, 3-man crew would be seated in adjacent couches; during other phases of flight, center couch would be stowed to permit more freedom of movement. Apollo command module cabin would have 365-cu. ft. volume, with 22-cu. ft. free area available to crew. “The small end of the command module may contain an airlock; when the lunar excursion module is not attached, the airlock would permit a pressure-suited crewman to exit to free space without decompressing the cabin. Crew ingress and egress while on Earth will be through a hatch in the side of the command module.”
168 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
During August: Under Secretary of the Air Force Joseph V. Charyk told Seventh Symposium on Ballistic Missile and Space Technology that usaf had flight-tested two Agena D upper-stage vehicles, the first firing occurring in June. Agena D would accommodate a variety of payloads, whereas earlier models Agena A and B had integrated payloads.
•	Congressman Bob Wilson of House Armed Services Committee,
addressing the Institute of World Affairs, recommended establishment of a U.S. Military Space Academy. He said he was “deeply concerned over the tendency of our space program to emphasize the experimental and scientific and de-emphasize the military aspects of space. . . . The Air Force has started a limited program to train spacemen for the future. It should be expanded into a full-fledged space manpower program. Perhaps a ‘fourth service’ should be set up to train men in astronautics, hypersonic aerodynamics, the physiological and psychological aspects of flight.”
•	American Rocket Society gave Congressman George Miller of
House Committee for Science and Astronautics a special award for his “outstanding leadership in space.”
SEPTEMBER 1962
September 1: nasa Venus probe mariner ii passed the million-mile mark on its interplanetary journey, jpl scientists said that they would send signals Sept. 3 to alter the trajectory and swing mariner ii on path that would come within 10,000 mi. of the planet Venus.
•	U.S.S.R. made another unsuccessful attempt to launch Venus probe,
the launch vehicle failing to achieve escape trajectory and remaining in parking orbit. (See Sept. 5).
•	U.S. sources disclosed that U.S.S.R. had unsuccessfully attempted
to launch a Venus probe on August 25, and that three fragments of the spacecraft were orbiting the earth. In accordance with its policy, U.S.S.R. made no announcement of unsuccessful launch.
•	usaf launched an unidentified satellite with a Thor-Agena B booster
from Vandenberg afb.
•	aec-dod jointly announced that the man-made radiation belt
created by U.S. high-altitude nuclear explosion was stronger than anticipated and might last for many years. The blast also intensified natural Van Allen radiation belt more than anticipated. aec-dod added that the new radiation belt had completely knocked out communications from satellites transit iv-b, traac, and ariel, but it would “not constitute any hazard to manned satellite launchings that we have planned in the near future.” The belt extended from 200 mi. above the earth to 700 mi., where it merged into the Van Allen belts.
•	injun satellite was apparently unaffected by artificial radiation
belt, reported Dr. Brian J. O’Brian, State University of Iowa physicist, injun orbits earth at about 500-mi. altitude, near center of the new radiation belt which had destroyed transmission from satellites ariel, transit iv-b, and traac. Dr. O’Brian speculated that injun transmission survived because satellite used low-efficiency solar cells, not as rapidly affected by radiation as high-efficiency cells used in ariel.
•	Reginald Lascelles, personal assistant and spokesman for Sir
Bernard Lovell, director of Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, said Lovell was afraid the new radiation belt would “seriously affect space exploration by radio astronomy.”
September mariner ii, 1.2 million mi. from earth on its voyage to vicinity of Venus, successfully swung a yard-wide antenna around and focused it on earth, sending radio beam back to scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The antenna maneuver was performed on command of on-board timer and was first of two in-flight maneuvers crucial to correcting the probe’s path to within 10,000 mi. of Venus; after scientists evaluated results of antenna orientation, nasa Goldstone Tracking Station would send radio command to fire rocket aboard the 447-lb. craft.

September 2: In editorial noting addition to fcc of 19 specialists to plan enforcement of communications satellite bill’s provisions for public interest protection, New York Times said: “the policymaking decisions confronting the fcc will become increasingly complex. How well and how wisely it discharges its duties will be of crucial importance in shaping the future of this mechanism [communications satellite] for bettering life through man’s conquest of space. . . . The march of science is sure to create many more situations in which the partnership of private and public efforts will entail a need for dependable instruments of Government regulation. This makes doubly urgent the successful exercise of the commission’s first test.”
•	More than 1,600 U.S. military aircraft participated in simulated
attack and defense maneuvers during norad’s Operation Sky Shield III, with all civilian aircraft grounded during the S^-hr. exercise.
•	Tenth anniversary of Livermore Branch of Lawrence Radiation
Laboratory, University of California. Established to “help cope with problems involved in maintaining American superiority in nuclear deterrence,” the laboratory devoted about half of its effort to weapons research and the remainder to peaceful uses of atomic energy.
September 8: mariner ii flight-path correction was postponed for at least 24 hours, because scientists could not determine if the Venus probe was stabilized on the moon or the earth, jpl scientists received moon-reference indication from mariner ii’s earth-sensing system and earth-reference indication from its high-gain antenna. If mid-course maneuver were executed with moon-lock instead of earth-lock, the probe probably would come within 12,000 mi. of Venus instead of 10,000 mi.
•	Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator, interviewed in
The National Observer, said: “Some people have drawn the conclusion that the Russians are ahead of the United States in the endeavor to land men on the moon and return them safely. This is based on a misconception that going to the moon is something like progress down a one-way street, passing successive street-corners.
“That is far from being the case. The enterprise requires mobilization of a large task force with many tasks to be done and brought to fruition simultaneously. In some aspects, it makes small difference in what order the tasks are performed. The fact that the Russians have done one part of the work of going to the moon does not mean that they are ahead in the entire enterprise. ...”
When asked about U.S. participation in international space programs, Dr. Dryden said: “The United States now has arrangements with more than 55 countries for space activity. . . . We hope to increase the number of countries with which we are co-operating. We have been engaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union toward that end.
“Recently, Academician Anatoli Blagonravov and I concluded the first phase of the negotiations with a joint recommendation to our governments that they undertake co-operative efforts in meteorology, communications, and the investigation of the earth’s magnetic field. . . . ”
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	171
September S: Congressman George P. Miller, chairman of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, told the press that “since the orbiting of the Soviet twin Cosmonauts, the agitation [among members of the Senate, professional military societies, and the trade press] borders on panic and constitutes a threat to a program which is not only very important but complex and carefully planned. ... I have been a consistent advocate of a military capability in space for the United States second to none, but I see no reason why our military requirements cannot be met without hamstringing or jeopardizing the civil space program. . . . There has been so much misinformation and misimpression generated about our space program, both the civil and military aspects, that I can no longer remain silent. The record has to be set straight and I intend to do it.” He said he would deliver a major speech on the House floor later this week, when he would place the space program into “balanced perspective.”
•	Report outlining nasa’s manned space flight projects was published
by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, with cooperation of nasa. Project Gemini two-man flights, planned for 1964 and aimed at orbital rendezvous, might be as much as a week long. Three-man Apollo flights would follow, circumlunar flights to be followed by lunar landing missions. Advance-design Gemini spacecraft would be first designed specifically by U.S. to come down on dry land, using Rogallo wing to control descent.
•	Preparations for Operation Harp (High Altitude Research Project)
announced by Dr. D. L. Mordell, Faculty of Engineering Dean at Canada’s McGill University. In the McGill-initiated project, McGill’s 66-in., 470-lb. Martlet missiles would be fired to approximately 200-mi. altitude from two 16-in., 140-ton guns provided by U.S. Navy. With the first launching in October from Barbados, B.W.I., McGill would become the first university to conduct its own space research program. At least 6 firings would be made before Christmas. Also involved in Harp were U.S. Army, which transported naval guns from Hampton Roads, Va., to Barbados; Florida State University meteorologists; and usn weather-observation aircraft.
•	P-1127 VTOLjet fighter airplane was publicly demonstrated for first
time at Farnsborough, England, Air Show. Developed by Hawker Siddeley Aviation, the P-1127 uses single Bristol Sia-deley Pegasus jet engine whose thrust is directed vertically for takeoff, then directed backward for horizontal flight at supersonic speeds.
•	U.S.S.R. conducted atmospheric nuclear test explosion of inter-
mediate-range yield, between 20,000 tons and one megaton. The firing took place near Novaya Zemlya and was the ninth in current Soviet series to be announced by aec.
•	Prof. Alexander A. Mikhailov, chairman of U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences Council for Astronomy, was reported by U.S. magazine as saying that the U.S.S.R. had 36 astronomical observatories in operation and 6 new facilities under construction.
•	Prof. Bruce Patton of London’s Institute of Education told British
Association for the Advancement of Science that English should be adopted as the universal language. He gave as one reason
172 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 19 62
the fact that English was the accepted language of civil aviation (except in Communist countries) and as another the fact that approximately half the world’s scientific journals were in English.
September 3-8: Tenth Conference on Science and World Affairs held in London, with more than 200 scientists from 37 countries attending. President Kennedy urged the conference to “explore fully and objectively the basic reasons for our failure thus far to reach agreement” on a nuclear test ban.
September 4: Kadio signals to Venus probe mariner ii, nearly 1.5 million mi. from earth, repositioned the craft and fired an onboard rocket to send the probe on desired trajectory toward Venus. Launched August 27, the 447-lb. interplanetary probe would have missed Venus by 233,000 mi. if the mid-course maneuver had not corrected its path. Signals from jpl’s Goldstone Tracking Station were sent after 24-hr. delay for scientists to determine that the spacecraft’s antenna was pointing to earth and not the moon. Assuming that its corrected course was nominal, it was estimated that mariner ii would come within
9,000	mi. of Venus December 14, covering about 180,200,000 mi. through space and relaying scientific data on interplanetary space and Venusian atmosphere.
•	In joint letter to nasa Administrator James E. Webb, Chairman of
Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences Robert S. Kerr and Chairman of House Committee on Science and Astronautics George P. Miller said: “The world must of necessity admire the remarkable achievements of the Soviet Union in the field of space. A shadow is thrown over the entire space effort through their refusal to admit to failures. . . .
“We feel it is important that if the U.S. Government possesses any information relative to unsuccessful attempts by the Soviet Union to launch a spacecraft to Venus, or other planetary probes, that this information should be made available to our committees and to the American people.”
•	John Rubel, Director of dod Office of Research and Development,
testified before subcommittee of House Committee on Science and Astronautics that it was “highly doubtful that dod would undertake a new weather satellite program at this time,” and stated the military interest in weather satellite development was adequately protected by existing nasa and Weather Bureau programs.
•	Dr. S. Fred Singer, director of National Weather Satellite Center,
said he was recommending an operational Tiros weather satellite system by next June because of Tiros’ “quite astounding” ability. tiros v was first to spot five of the ten major tropical storms around the world in August. He added that scheduled launch of sixth Tiros satellite would not be delayed by the man-made radiation belt.
•	U.S.S.R. formally protested “provocative flight” of a U.S. U-2
reconnaissance airplane over Sakhalin Island in the Pacific. Replying to the U.S.S.R., U.S. stated that the pilot of the August 31 flight “has reported he was flying a directed course well outside the Soviet territorial limits but encountered severe winds during this nighttime flight and may, therefore, have unintentionally overflown the southern tip of Sakhalin.” The note reaffirmed
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	173
U.S. policy of not permitting reconnaissance flights over Soviet territory, established after U-2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers was brought down in U.S.S.R. May 1, 1960.
September British physicist Dr. Eric Mendoza of University of Manchester explained superconductivity principle at British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting. He stated the problem as why several superconducting metals (such as lead and aluminum) at extremely low temperatures suddenly lose all traces of electrical resistance and are able to conduct currents without producing heat. Normal electrical resistance is produced when electrons are knocked out of their paths by collision with heavy metallic atoms. In superconductors, he said, the electrons get past the atoms without being deflected, because “electrons, instead of moving as individuals, move in pairs.” Vibrations of the metallic atoms in superconductors are so slowed down by extremely low temperature (minus 273° C) that they are unable to break the pairs, so current flows without friction.
•	Reported that U.S.S.R. had invited Dr. Bernard M. Wagner of the
U.S. to visit U.S.S.R. for cooperative exchange of space medicine data, including information obtained from vostok iii and iv manned orbital flights. Dr. Wagner, chairman of Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, would leave for Moscow October 5.
September 5: nasa Administrator Webb reported that the U.S.S.R. had tried to send four probes to Venus and two to Mars since October 10,1958. In letter to chairmen of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Mr. Webb said Venus attempts were made on February 4, 1961; August 25, 1962; and September 1, 1962; and each time the launch vehicle achieved parking orbit but failed to send probes on escape trajectory. The one partially successful Venus probe, launched Februaiy 12, 1961, achieved proper flight path but its radio transmission failed when probe was 4.5 million miles from earth. Mars attempts were made October 10 and 14, 1960, and each time the launch vehicle failed to achieve parking orbit.
•	Agreement establishing U.S.-Italy cooperative space program,
signed in May, was confirmed in Rome by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and Italian Foreign Minister Attilio Piccioni. The Memorandum of Understanding between nasa and the Italian Space Commission provided for three-phase program, expected to culminate in launching of a scientific satellite into equatorial orbit. Generally, nasa would provide the Scout rockets and personnel training; Italians would launch the vehicle with its Italian payload and would be responsible for data acquisition as well as for towable launch platform located in equatorial waters.
•	nasa announced it would negotiate with three companies to conduct
three-month studies of a lunar logistics system. Negotiations with Space Technology Laboratories, Inc., related to $150,000 study of types of spacecraft which could carry supplies to manned Apollo landing site on the moon; negotiations with Northrop Space Laboratories and Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. related to $75,000 studies and operational analyses of possible cargoes for the lunar logistics spacecraft. Various nasa centers
174 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 19 62
simultaneously would study lunar logistics system trajectories, launch vehicle adaptation, scheduling, alternate spacecraft propulsion concepts, lunar landing touchdown dynamics, and use of roving vehicles on the lunar surface.
September 5: White House announced President Kennedy would visit military and civilian missile and rocket installations at Cape Canaveral, Fla.; Huntsville, Ala.; Houston, Tex.; and St. Louis, Mo., on September 11-12. President Kennedy would be accompanied by Vice President Johnson, Secretary of Defense McNamara, nasa Administrator Webb, bob director David E. Bell, and several Congressmen. Purpose of trip was “to study the work being done in this most important area and in connection with the preparation of the fiscal year 1964 budget. . .
•	13-min. radio program relayed from New York via telstar satellite
to Europe, where it was broadcast by Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty to audiences in U.S.S.R. and Communist-bloc countries. Program featured message on U.S.-U.S.S.R. nuclear disarmament by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey.
•	Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell L. Gilpatric, addressing repre-
sentatives of Midwest industries and universities in South Bend, Ind., said:
“The United States believes that it is highly desirable for its own security and for the security of the world that the arms race should not be extended into outer space, and we are seeking in every feasible way to achieve this purpose. Today there is no doubt that either the United States or the Soviet Union could place thermonuclear weapons in orbit. . . .
“We have no program to place any weapons of mass destruction into orbit. An arms race in space will not contribute to our security. ...”
He added that U.S. military space program has two objectives:
“First, as part of our overall Defense effort, we have continuing programs to ensure that the United States will be able to cope with any military challenge in outer space. Our programs in this area are under constant review, and this review indicates that our present rate of effort is entirely adequate.
“Second, as a part of our national space program, we in the Defense Department, along with nasa, are actively exploring the potentialities of outer space as a useful part of our expanding universe. We are developing through activities in space and observations from space our ability to improve our capabilities in fields such as communications, navigation, meteorology, mapping and geodesy. Many branches of industry are contributing to this endeavor by improving propulsion, electronic, photographic, communications and other components of systems for space research and utilization. These programs have great significance not only for our military forces hut for the economic and scientific advance of the United States and of the whole world. The progress that they represent, like all scientific advances, is neu+ral in its political and moral content. . .
•	nasa announced that nine companies had submitted proposals to
develop lunar excursion module (lem), one of three modules comprising the Apollo spacecraft. After evaluating proposals, nasa would award contract “within six to eight weeks,” according to the Wall Street Journal.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1062	175
September 5: nasa Marshall Space Flight Center announced award of $4,673,327-contract to Ets-Hokin and Galvin, Inc., of San Francisco, for construction of main structural portion of Advanced Saturn test stand at msfc, Huntsville, Ala. When completed, the 405-ft.-high test tower would be used for static-firing the 7.5-million-lb.-thrust first stage of Advanced Saturn.
•	Re-entry and disintegration of sputnik iv reported by Edward A.
Hallbach, director of Milwaukee Astronomical Society. Hall-bach and others observed the satellite as it broke into about 24 pieces, most of which fell from orbit toward Green Bay, Wise., area and Lake Michigan. Law officers in a wide area of northern Wisconsin reported seeing flaming objects at about the same time. sputnik iv was launched by U.S.S.R. on May 15, 1960.
•	Chunk of metal, too hot to touch, was discovered in Manitowoc,
Wise., street by two policemen. Considered as possibly part of sputnik iv, the 20-lb. object was sent by local members of nationwide Moonwatch tracking network to Moonwatch hq. at Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Mass., where fragment would be analysed.
•	Hughes Research Laboratories announced development of high-
power amplifier tube that could eliminate spacecraft radio blackouts such as those experienced by astronauts during atmospheric re-entry. Tubes produce about 10 times the continuous power output of any previous tubes and could pierce heat-induced ion shields to transmit messages.
•	General Mills launched balloon, trailing 315-ft.-long reflectorized
polyethelene tube in test to improve long-range communications, from GM’s research center at New Brighton, Minn. The cylinder, 23 ft. in diameter, was designed as a relay device to receive commercial TV signals from wkbt-tv, La Crosse, Wise., and relay them 260 mi. to usaf base, Wadena, Minn.
September 6: nasa Aerobee 100 sounding rocket launched at White Sands Missile Range (wsmr) by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (jpl), the rocket reaching 46-mi. altitude in successful experiment to measure ultraviolet ray airglow spectrum.
•	jpl scientists reported that Venus-bound mariner ii was success-
fully transmitting data from nearly two million mi. in space. John W. Thatcher, staff engineer of jpl’s Deep Space Instrumentation Facility (dsif), said, “We fully expect that we will be able to track it and follow it well beyond Venus.” Signals were reported coming in relatively “loud and clear” at receiving stations in Goldstone, Calif.; Johannesburg, So. Africa; and Woomera, Australia.
•	International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. (itat), announced
plans for nasa Project Relay satellite communication experiment to link North and South America. To be launched into orbit from Cape Canaveral this year, the satellite would relay 12 telephone calls at once, from itat ground relay station in Nutley, N.J., to portable ground station near Rio de Janeiro. The satellite, built by rca for nasa, would also transmit TV from North America to Europe via ground stations at Andover, Me.; Goon-hilly Downs, England; and Pleumeur-Bodou, France. In another set of experiments, Relay would establish telephone communications between Brazil and England. Relay would radiate microwave signal of 10 watts, compared to telstar’s 2-watt signal.
176 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
September 6: Congressman George P. Miller, chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, defended the U.S. space program in speech on floor of the House. Arguing that Soviet vostok in and iv manned orbital flights did not justify changes in the U.S. program, he said:
“Certainly I will not stand here and say that more and better military space programs should not be undertaken. What I do say is that a considerable effort in this field has long been underway and that the Monday-morning quarterbacks whose teeth start chattering after every Russian ‘spectacular’ might exhibit a bit more faith in those who have the actual responsibility for the defense of the country. . . .
“[We should not overlook] . . . the fact that the Soviets have now demonstrated two important capabilities: First, that they have sufficient launch facilities and rocket reliability to launch two manned spacecraft within a short time, and second, that they have the ability to time launches with great precision. These capabilities are an important step toward the development of the rendezvous and docking technique which will be of great value in achieving many advanced objectives in space exploration, some of which may have potential military value.
“These, I think, are the formidable implications of their recent feat. But these implications are no reason for us to put our program in a constant state of flux, with projects starting, stopping, and shifting in response to each new Soviet development. Our undertaking is gigantic, immensely complex. It cannot be assembled and disassembled and redesigned and reassembled without losing its direction and momentum, and the space contest itself. . . .
“There is a suggestion that the military services should duplicate work now in progress under the civilian agency. There is nothing particularly military about solutions to problems involved in the effects of long-term weightlessness, radiation, and isolation. The capabilities of both civilian and military research agencies should be brought to bear on these problems in a coordinated manner.
“On the record, then, it appears that the critics of our space program are not asking that we do twice as much—but that we do everything twice. I do not think the economy will take that, but even if it would—it just does not make sense.
“And how about the reciprocal use of the knowledge we are gaining? Science knows no exclusive applications technologically speaking, what is developed by civilians can be used militarily and vice versa. . . .
“It seems farily well established that the real cause of all this squabble about the military-in-space stems from an inhouse difference of opinion within the military establishment. The problem is not that our civil space program is retarding the military. On the contrary, it is enhancing it and will continue to do so in the future. The problem is that the military space enthusiasts have not been able to obtain all the green lights they want from their bosses. ... I am confident the controversy will be resolved in time—and expeditiously, I hope.”
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	177
September 6: usia Voice of America began broadcasting reports of U.S.S.R. unsuccessful interplanetary probes and sent the announcement to newspapers all oyer the world via its wireless press network. Public release of information on Soviet space failures was made September 5 in form of letter from nasa Administrator James E. Webb to Congressmen.
•	telstar satellite was used to relay exchange of reports of action on
New York and Paris stock exchanges, in 10-min. test transmission of telephone call between Michael W. McCarthy, chairman of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, and Smith, Inc., to Frederick J. Sears, manager of Merrill Lynch’s Paris office.
•	Weather Bureau announced weather data gathered by Tiros satellite
was relayed to France via telstar satellite.
•	Ernest Brackett, nasa procurement officer, told American Manage-
ment Association that about 80% of nasa’s contracts are made for research and development, and outlined nasa procedures of awarding r&d contracts.
•	usn launched second Polaris A-3 in partially successful test from
Cape Canaveral, a malfunction during second-stage flight causing the missile to fall far short of its intended 1,950-mi. range.
•	In response to U.S. explanation that U-2 reconnaissance plane may
have unintentionally overflown Soviet territory, Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said U.S. Government spokesmen in the U-2 situation were “making clumsy attempts to exonerate themselves, attempts unworthy of responsible politicians.” Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda claimed U.S. was renewing “provocative” reconnaissance flights and said that “such activities only intensify the threat of war, heat up the international situation and stir up suspicion and hostility between countries.”
•	British Minister of Aviation Julian Amery told London audience
that Aviation Ministry was studying an “aerospace plane” that could be operated either in the atmosphere or in space. London newspapers reported that the craft was a “space fighter” that takes off in conventional manner but can fly into orbit and back at speeds up to 18,000 mph. Space fighter was reportedly based on concept of sustained flight rather than boost-glide principle used in U.S. Dyna Soar.
•	U.S. and Australian scientists reported in Science that phases of
the moon affect rainfall on earth. Their studies in both northern and southern hemispheres disclosed that heavy rains fall most frequently in the first and third weeks of the synodical month— the period from one new moon to the next.
September 7: aec-dod-nasa announced that results of joint study of artificial radiation belt indicated Project Mercury flight MA-8 could be made with no change of plans and with no fear of harm to Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr. (Cdr., usn). Study showed that radiation on outside of capsule during Cdr. Schirra’s 6-orbit flight would be about 500 roentgen (R). Shielding, vehicle structures, and flight suit would cut this to 8 R on the astronaut’s skin. “This exposure is well below the mission limit previously established by nasa for the manned flight program,” the report said.
Other results of the investigation: Soviet Cosmonauts Ni-kolayev and Popovich (vostok iii and iv orbital flights in August)

received very small radiation doses on their double-mission flight; radio interference caused by new radiation belt constituted “a significant problem to radio astronomy”; radiation doses caused rapid deterioration of solar cells aboard ariel, traac, transit iv-b satellites as previously reported, but telstar solar cells were apparently unaffected; future space missions were being reviewed “in light of the present information concerning the new belt.” It appeared likely that “a substantial number” of future space experiments would be changed to avoid possible damage from radiation.
September 7: Replying to queries of whether Administrator Webb’s public letter of Sept. 5 on Soviet failures marked a reversal of nasa policy, nasa said no change had been made in policy of not releasing information on unsuccessful Soviet space attempts. The September 5 letter to Congressmen was “an exception to a continuing policy.”
•	Aerospace Industrial Life Sciences Assn., established to “assist the
industrial aerospace life scientist through exchange of information and to increase his contribution to the nation’s space efforts through better professional communication in the industrial life sciences field,” with Dr. Charles M. Gell of Ling-Temco-Vought as president, ails was accepted as full affiliate of U.S. Aerospace Medical Association.
•	D. Brainerd Holmes, nasa Director of Manned Space Flight,
addressed National Advanced Technology Management Council in Seattle on the U.S. lunar program. “Although we are still in a very early phase of the greatest engineering project that man has ever undertaken, the Nation has made four crucial management decisions which clear the way for action. First, the goal has been identified. We are to land American explorers on the moon. Second, the timetable has been laid down. We are to carry out the mission and return the U.S. explorers safely to earth within this decade. Third, we have settled on the organization to meet the national goal on schedule. Finally, we have selected the method which we believe can accomplish the lunar expedition on the shortest possible time schedule, with the greatest assurance of success, and at the least expense. You do not need to be a specialist in management to realize that decisions such as these are central to the success of any job—what to do, when to do it, who is to be in charge, and how it is to be done. In the United States space program, these fundamental decisions have been made. And we have proceeded with the work to carry them out at the swiftest pace consonant with other processing needs of the country and with the resources available ....
“The achievement which stands out [in the manned lunar landing program] . . ., in my opinion, has been the launching by the people of the United States of a truly national effort to demonstrate our determination and our capacity to sail on the new ocean of space and to master the technology of the space age in all its aspects—for the security of the Free World and the good of all mankind.
“The lunar landing is no stunt. The most important accomplishment will be the development by this Nation of the ability to make the landing, and not the landing itself. Achievement of such ability is worth the great investment in brains and
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1062	179
industrial capacity and technological advance that we are making. The lunar landing is a yardstick—a measure of this country’s technological leadership, a measure of the ability of this democracy to ‘manage,’ if you will, a great engineering and technological undertaking in the national interest.”
September 7: In private audience with Pope John XXIII, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson presented the Pope with a small model of telstar communications satellite.
September 8: RL-10 rocket engine successfully static-fired in second test at nasa Marshall Space Flight Center. Cluster of the liquid-hydrogen engines would power second stage (S-IV) of the Saturn C-l.
•	Atlas rocket for manned orbital flight MA-8 was static-fired suc-
cessfully for 11 seconds at Cape Canaveral.
•	usaf announced Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Develop-
ment would be focal point for space projects within the Air Staff. Lt. Gen. James Ferguson, dc/s for rad, would be responsible for such projects as Midas, Titan III, Dyna Soar, communications satellites, and nasa liaison and support.
•	Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, speaking at Danish-Soviet Friend-
ship Advancement Society in Copenhagen, attacked U.S. space projects. He charged U.S. launched satellites which spied on other countries, endangered space travel by its atmospheric nuclear tests, and put millions of copper needles in space, making space research difficult. He added: “I also know a certain country is considering plans to set up bases on the moon from which attacks on other parts of the world can be made.”
September 8-22: First nasa exhibit in Europe was displayed in pavilion of Swiss National Trade Fair, in Lausanne.
September 9: Three-man crew “survived” a simulated week-long, round-trip to the moon, in simulation chamber at Martin Co. plant, near Baltimore. Crew in the simulator, which resembled Apollo spacecraft in size and shape, consisted of 3 nasa civilian test pilots: Donald L. Maffick and Harold E. Ream of Langley Research Center, and Glenn W. Stinnett of Ames Research Center. During the simulated flight, made in July, the men took turns as pilot, co-pilot, and navigator, and each made a simulated landing on the moon’s surface in the special one-man capsule designed by Langley scientists.
•	Plan calling for international sounding-rocket launching site to be
set up under U.N. auspices would be presented to U.N. General Assembly by 28-nation Committee on Outer Space, New York Times reported. Originally proposed by U.S. last June, plan provided that all member countries would be given access to facility for collection of meteorological and other scientific data.
•	U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation re-
leased detailed report warning that any radiation dose, however small, can cause biological and hereditary effects. “The Committee therefore emphasizes the need that all forms of unnecessary exposure be minimized or avoided entirely. ” Adopted unanimously by the 15-nation committee, the 442-page report was the most comprehensive in the 7-year history of the Committee.
•	25-franc postage stamp picturing telstar communications center

180 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
September 10: nasa Project Mercury officials postponed for three days the 6-orbit space flight of Astronaut Walter M. Schirra (MA-8), now scheduled for September 28. Delay was to permit further time for flight preparation.
•	aec-dod announced that a “few” atmospheric tests would be con-
ducted with nuclear devices dropped from airplanes, beginning late this month. Extension of atmospheric series, originally planned to end in July, was expected to end in 60 days. In addition to the atmospheric tests, plans called for three more high-altitude explosions, to be conducted with rocket-launched nuclear devices and at altitudes below 100 mi. to avoid creation of further radiation belts.
•	nasa indicated it would begin series of flights with an inflatable para-
glider in mid-1963. Flights would provide information on frequency and size of micrometeoroid particles in space and allow post-flight laboratory study of impacts caused by such particles. Paraglider would be launched by Aerobee research rocket from White Sands Missile Range (wsmb) to height of 700,000 ft., and would descend to earth at speed of mach 5. Its re-entry path would be almost straight down—at an angle of 82°. Inflated paraglider would be 14-ft. long with span of 18 ft.; it would weigh 170 lbs. during launch and 85 lbs. during re-entry.
•	Fire in simulated space cabin at sam, Brooks afb, Texas, caused seri-
ous smoke-inhalation injuries to Capt. Carl C. Fletcher, Jr. (usaf) , one of two men spending 13th consecutive day in cabin; his partner, Capt. Dean B. Smith (usaf), escaped serious injury. Atmosphere in the sealed cabin was almost pure oxygen when fire occurred. Airman 1/C Henry W. Hall broke the cabin’s seal, quickly depressurized it, and brought out the two men. Cause of fire, which badly damaged the cabin, was unknown.
•	Soviet delegate Platon D. Morozov demanded that U.N. Com-
mittee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space reach agreement on legal aspects of space exploration before considering scientific and technical program, at opening meeting of Committee’s autumn 1962 session. Morozov argued that U.S. high-altitude nuclear test in July had caused atmospheric radiation that imperiled the lives of Soviet cosmonauts; he also commented that international space cooperation would be possible only “in a disarmed world.” When U.S. delegate Francis T. P. Plimpton said he hoped Mr. Morozov was not trying to “block progress” on technical issues, Morozov said U.S.S.R. had accepted “in principle” the recommendations of the scientific and technical committee and later added that his Government would not make agreement on international technical cooperation dependent upon acceptance of Soviet views on legal issues. Committee finally agreed to consider the two subcommittee reports jointly. Subcommittee on international space law had met in Geneva last summer but had failed to reach agreement.
•	David J. Mann of Thiokol Chemical Corp. told American Chemical
Society that Thiokol was developing new rocket fuel, oxygen difluoride, 15% more powerful than current rocket fuels. Used as oxidizer with such substances as diborane or monomethylhy-drazine, oxygen difluoride could save 7 ft. in length and 350 lbs. in weight on an Apollo-type launch vehicle. Other claimed
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	181
advantages were improved storability and capacity to remain in liquid form under wider range of conditions than possible with liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen. New fuel’s density would permit large amounts to be stored in smaller volume.
September 10: Communist China announced that U.S.-built “U-2 plane of the Chiang bandit group intruded into the airspace of East China on the morning of September 9 and was shot down by the air force of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.” The U.S. confirmed that the U-2 missing over East China was one of two sold to Nationalist China by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. in 1960.
•	Tass announced death of Maj. Gen. Vladimir Y. Klimov of Soviet
Corps of Engineers. General Klimov developed Y.K. jet engine used in MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighter planes.
September 11: Venus probe mariner ii passed the 2.5-million-mile mark on its 180-million-mile journey to vicinity of Venus. Speed relative to the earth was 6,512 mph. Four of the six scientific experiments aboard were sending data back to earth; the other two experiments would not be activated until spacecraft approached Venus.
•	President Kennedy toured nasa Marshall Space Flight Center,
Huntsville, Ala., and Launch Operations Center, Cape Canaveral, Fla. At msfc, he inspected a mock-up of the F-l engine and a Saturn C-l launch vehicle, and later witnessed 30-sec. static-firing of 1.3-million-lb.-thrust S-l stage for Saturn SA-4 launch vehicle. At loc, he inspected launch complexes for Mercury-Atlas vehicle, Titan rocket, and Saturn C-l. He then flew to Houston, Tex., to visit nasa Manned Spacecraft Center on September 12. Addressing workers at Cape Canaveral, the President said: “I don’t think we can exaggerate the great advantage which the Soviet Union secured in the ’50s by being first in space. They were able to give prestige to their system, they were able to give force to their argument that they were an advancing society and that we were on the decline.
“But I believe that we are an advancing society, and I believe that we are on the rise, and I believe that their system is as old as time. . . .”
He said that, as long as the American system was to be judged in at least one degree by its achievements in space, the United States “might as well be first, and therefore, this country, both political parties, have determined that the United States shall be first.”
•	Reported in the New York Times that new radiation belt created by
July 200-mi.-high nuclear explosion in the Pacific was expected to cause cancellation of U.S. planned 500-mi.-high test in the Johnston Island series. Within this new belt, electron intensity was about 100 times greater than usual radiation peak in the outer part of the Van Allen belt; at higher altitudes the electrons could persist for 5 years or more. Before the July test, U.S. had predicted any trapped electrons would disappear “within a few weeks” of the explosion.
•	U.S. delegate to U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space, Francis T. P. Plimpton, replying to Soviet criticism of U.S. high-altitude nuclear explosion, charged that U.S.S.R. had secretly conducted at least one high-altitude nuclear explosion
182 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962
within the last year. “Although the Soviet Union has never announced it, it is a fact that the Soviet Union itself carried out high-altitude nuclear tests during its series which began a year ago this month.”
September 11: U.S.S.R. delegate to the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space expressed approval of a subcommittee’s recommendation to establish an international sounding rocket launching base on the geomagnetic equator. U.S. delegate Plimpton welcomed the Soviet position.
•	National Research Corp. had determined that certain micro-orga-
nisms may be able to survive such space environment effects as temperature extremes and ultrahigh vacuum, in first phase of study program sponsored by nasa. Five known laboratory strains of micro-organisms were subjected to simulated space conditions for five days, and certain species were found to be “highly resistant” to temperature and ultrahigh vacuum effects. Future studies would consider heat and ultraviolet solar effects and gamma irradiation.
•	Congressman Victor Anfuso (N.Y.), speaking before the Pan Ameri-
can Management Club at Cape Canaveral, said:
“Recognizing the very significant contrast between our mission in space and that of the Russians, we must do three things:
“1. Convince the world that our venture into space is a peaceful one—to bring back benefits which will create a world of abundance, making war and strife among nations unnecessary. . . .
“2. We must, at all costs, achieve dominance in all phases of space exploration for our own security and that of all peoples of the earth.
“3. We must establish freedom in space and invite all nations of the world, having a contribution to make, to join our efforts.
“To accomplish all these three things requires an all-out effort on our part—a mobilization of all our resources—sacrifices on the part of Government, business, industry, and labor. . . .”
•	aec reported that kiwi b-ib reactor had been damaged recently
during its experimental ground test series with a static-power run at the Nevada Test Site. Further analysis would be required to determine exact cause and extent of the malfunction.
•	United Auto Workers and International Association of Machinists
unions in Los Angeles announced they had set September 22 as strike date against 4 aerospace companies—North American Aviation, Inc., Lockheed Aircraft Corp., General Dynamics Corp., and Ryan Aircraft Co. President Kennedy warned that such a strike, involving nearly 100,000 workers, “would seriously set us back in space exploration and would imperil the Nation’s defense.”
•	In interview in Yugoslav Government newspaper Borba, Soviet
Cosmonaut Gherman Titov said U.S.S.R. was planning flight to the moon in 1965. “If some problem arises and a solution is not found immediately, the time is extended.”

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	183
September 12: President Kennedy toured nasa’s Manned Space Center, after speaking at Rice University, Houston, where he said:
“. . . Man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space.
“Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions, the first waves of modem invention, and the first wave of nuclear power, and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space.
“We mean to be a part of it. We mean to lead it, for the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace.
“We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.
“Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first. In short, our leadership in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security, our obligations to ourselves as well as others, all require us to make this effort, to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and to become the world’s leading spacefaring nation.
“We sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own.
“Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new, terrifying theater of war.
“I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.
“There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again.........
“We choose to go to the moon ... in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
“It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the
184 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency. . . .
“We have had our failures, but so have others, even if they do not admit them. And they may be less public.
“To be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned space flight. But we do not intend to stay behind. In this decade we shall make up and move ahead. . .
September 12: nasa announced it would launch a special satellite before the end of the year to “obtain information on possible effects of radiation on future statellites and to give the world’s scientific community additional data on the artificial environment created by the [radiation] belt.” The 100-lb. satellite would be launched from Cape Canaveral into an elliptical orbit ranging from about 170-mi. perigee to 10,350-mi. apogee.
•	usaf Titan II rocket flew 5,000 miles in its third success of five test
launchings. All test objectives were met on the 30-min. flight from Cape Canaveral to target area near Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean.
•	U.K. and Canada supported U.S. request that U.N. Committee on
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space concentrate on international cooperation on space programs rather than on legal matters that contained elements of “a highly political and controversial nature.”
•	nasa management meeting held to brief key officials on a manned
space station program and to discuss possible FY 1964 funding.
•	Senate passed bill (S. 3138) to authorize faa to conduct research
to “determine what means and criteria can be employed to reduce and, hopefully, eliminate objectionable aircraft noise.” Bill was referred to the House.
•	Walter Reed Army Institute of Research dedicated a new, 55,000-
watt nuclear reactor, to be used in research on “creating a medication to ward off radiation.”
•	First “mystery” satellite in history of space exploration was
launched, according to British magazine Flight International. Magazine said satellite orbited at height of 113 mi. and reentered earth’s atmosphere 12 days later. Satellite was listed as belonging to usaf, but spokesman said this was a “scientific guess based on our assessment of previous satellite launchings.” Launching was not confirmed, and no official U.S. listing included such a satellite.
•	Balloon-borne Cassegrain telescope was launched from Artesia,
N.M., to altitude of about 86,000 ft. by usaf Cambridge Research Laboratories. Besides the telescope, the 850-lb. payload included interferometer spectrometer to take spectra of moon and planet Venus. Other information obtained on this initial Project Sky top flight concerned amount of water vapor present in upper atmosphere. Third objective of flight was to obtain information required to measure amount of different gases in upper atmosphere of Venus. Instrumentation failure prevented the telescope from orienting on Venus for sufficient length of time.
•	usaf named first two test pilots of the mach three RS-70: Lt. Col.
Joseph F. Cotton, of Rushville, Ind.; and Maj. Fitzhugh Fulton, of Talladega, Ala.
•	Two usn pilots, in separate flights, officially claimed two world
flying records held by U.S.S.R. since 1940. LCdr. Fred A. W.

Franke reached 27,380-ft. altitude in UF-2G Albatross amphibian with 4,410-lb. load; LCdr. Donald E. Moore reached 29,460-ft. altitude in same aircraft with 2,205-lb. load. Both flights were made from New York nas, Floyd Bennett Field.
September IS: Back in Washington after two-day tour of U.S. space facilities, President Kennedy held news conference. Asked why decision was made to extend U.S. atmospheric nuclear tests, the President said :
“There are two reasons. One is that, as you know, because of the blow-up in the pad at Johnston Island and because of the earlier failures of the communication system in the missile, we were not able to carry out these tests which were . . . among the most important, if not the most important of our series.
“So we are going to finish those. In addition, as a result of the earlier tests of this Dominic series, there were certain things learned which we would like to prove out.
“So we have agreed to a limited number of tests in concluding the Dominic series, and also we have taken some steps to prevent a repetition of the incident which caused an increase in the number of electrons in the atmosphere, by lowering the altitude and the yield so that lunar flights will not be further endangered.”
Asked whether U.S. position of refraining from competition with U.S.S.R. military space vehicles would condemn U.S. to second place in the military field, President Kennedy replied:
“No, Mr. Alexander. As I said last week, in the first place we are spending $1.5 billion a year on our military space program. What is the key for the success both of peaceful exploration of space as well as the military mastery of space are large boosters, effective control of the capsule, and the ability to rendezvous, and all of the rest, so that there is an obvious usefulness if the situation should require, military usefulness for our efforts, peaceful efforts, in space.
“In addition, as you know, very recently we determined to go ahead with the Titan III, which gives the United States Air Force a very strong weapon if that should become necessary. So that the work that nasa is doing on Saturn and the work the Air Force is doing on Titan and the work being done on the Apollo program and Gemini and the others, all have a national security factor as well as a peaceful factor. . . .
“I think the United States is attempting, and this Administration, as you know, is making a very massive effort in space. As I said, we are spending three times what we spent last year in space, and more in this year’s budget than the eight previous years, so that this is a tremendous effort, $5.5 billion as well as the money that we are spending for the military use of space.
“As I say, the size of the booster and the capsule and the control all would have, if the situation required it, a military use. We hope it does not; we hope that space will be used for peaceful purposes. That is the policy of the United States Government, but we shall be prepared if it does not; and in addition, as I said from the beginning, both the Soviet Union and the United States have a capacity to send a missile to each other’s country with a nuclear warhead on it, so that we must keep some perspective as to where the danger may lie. But the United States, in the effort
97317—63--13
186 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1062
it is making both in the peaceful program and the military program, all of this will increase our security if the Soviet Union should attempt to use space for military purposes.”
Asked if he were hopeful that U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperative ventures in space exploration were likely in the near future, he replied: “No. As you know, Dr. Dryden had some conversations in Geneva with regard to the matter, and some progress was made, but it is limited in its scope and we would hope more could be done and more, perhaps, could be done if the atmosphere between the two countries should be improved.”
September 13: Paresev (Paraglider Research Vehicle) flown at nasa Flight Research Center. First manned vehicle designed to be towed aloft and released like a conventional glider, Paresev was towed to 6,000-ft. altitude by Stearman biplane. Released, the craft was flown back to Rogers Dry Lake bed in 3 min. 44 sec. by nasa project pilot, Milton 0. Thompson. Paresev flight program provided data on (1) flare and landing capabilities; (2) stability and controllability; and (3) pilot training. Possible uses of the paraglider concept included recovery of future spacecraft and rocket boosters.
•	nasa-dod jointly announced undertaking of a joint study to improve
field operations involved in contract management for both dod and nasa contracts. Under direction of committee chaired by Assistant Secretary of Defense (i&l) Thomas D. Morris, the study was to improve effectiveness of field contract management, to improve responsiveness to buying offices and systems project offices, to assist nasa’s increasing contract management requirements with minimum of additional personnel, and to ensure continued contract management efficiency in times of national emergency. Combined value of dod and nasa contracts during FY 1963 would be approximately $30 billion.
•	Hearings on U.S. program for atomicTpropulsion held by Joint
(Congressional) Committee on Atomic Energy, with nasa Administrator James E. Webb, aec Commissioner Leland Haworth, msfc Director Dr. Wernher von Braun, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory Director Norris Bradbury, and snpo Director Harold Finger all agreeing on need for living facilities near atomic test site in southern Nevada, nasa-aec Nerva (nuclear engine) development would require between 1,500 and 2,000 employees at the Nevada site. However, the prospect of commuting 180 mi. daily to and from the nearest town (Las Vegas) was scaring away prospective workers, according to testimony.
•	Dr. Harold B. Finger, Director of joint aec-nasa Space Nuclear
Propulsion Office (snpo), told Joint Committee on Atomic Energy that first flight date in nuclear-powered space vehicle program (Project Rover) had been moved from 1966 to 1967. Overoptimism, technical difficulties, organizational problems, and a situation in which construction workers have to spend 4 hours a day commuting to the Nevada test site have all contributed to the delay, he testified.
•	Testimony before the Joint (Congressional) Committee on Atomic
Energy revealed management difficulties on Project Pluto nuclear-powered vehicle, to fly at 2,000 mph within the atmosphere. Dr. Leland Haworth, member of aec, testified that aec was
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	187
“awaiting a firm decision” from dod on whether the project would be continued. Reactor for nuclear ramjet rocket, under development since 1956, had been successfully ground-tested in Nevada. Dr. Harold Brown, director of dod research and engineering, said dod hoped that a decision could be reached “within a month.” An estimated $500 million would be required to continue the project through flight-test phase.
September IS: President Kennedy urged four major aerospace manufacturers (North American Aviation, Lockheed, General Dynamics, and Ryan) to accept terms proposed by a special Presidential board for settlement of their labor contract dispute with two unions (United Auto Workers and International Association of Machinists). He also named another special board to try to mediate a dispute between the International Association of Machinists and the Boeing Co., asking the union not to strike but to continue work until November 15 so the board could try to work out a solution.
•	Astronaut Walter Schirra, Jr., interviewed on nationally-televised
cbs program, criticized delayed reporting of Astronaut M. Scott Carpenter’s landing during flight MA-7: “We had a lot of information there [during the 35-min. period from blackout of communications when spacecraft re-entered until public announcement of reception of signals from spacecraft] and yet it never came out and it was disgusting, you know.”
Schirra also commented on the heavy demands on Astronaut John H. Glenn for “outside” personal appearances. Interview had been taped several weeks before its broadcast.
•	India offered to provide launching base for U.N. international
rocket probes in session of U.N. Committee for Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. India’s proposal was related to a proposal that 1964 be designated International Year of the Quiet Sun (iqsy), and include equatorial sounding rockets to gather data above the earth’s Equator. Southern part of India lies within 10° of the Equator and would provide suitable launching site for the project.
•	Congressman George Meader (Mich.) introduced H.R. 13130, bill
to establish a Commission on Research and Development. The new bill was a “perfected” version of his earlier bill. He called attention to S. 2771, the bill which had passed the Senate, and urged that “speedy action be taken on the legislation.”
•	Analysis of the metal chunk behoved to have been part of Soviet
satellite sputnik iv showed the object had greater radiation level than any other object previously recovered from space, aec scientists at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (N. Mex.) said one reason for high radiation was that the chunk was analyzed soon after being found, whereas previous objects had not been analyzed until at least three weeks after being found. Radiation expert Dr. Ernest C. Anderson of Los Alamos reported that the object had same sort of radioactivity shown by natural iron meteorites, evidence that the object was part of a spacecraft that had been orbiting for long time above the atmosphere, sputnik iv went into orbit May 15, 1960, and disintegrated September 5, 1962, over the U.S. Los Alamos forwarded 14-lb. chunk to U.S. delegation to U.N. Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space;
188 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory had kept a 6-lb. slice of the original object for further examination.
September 13: First operational Atlas-F launching silos turned over to Strategic Air Command. Ceremonies were held at one of the underground launching complexes near Salina, Kans.
•	Reported that Hughes Aircraft Co. had developed special devices
to determine radiation dosage an astronaut may absorb in space flight. Called “tissue-equivalent ionization chambers” and developed under usaf contract, the instruments would be installed in three usaf “plastinauts,” man-sized dummies of astronauts made of plastic simulating human tissue. The plastinauts were designed “to fly in any space vehicle capable of carrying a man.”
•	usaf Skybolt missile was intentionally destroyed when missile
veered off course, third failure in three flight attempts of the air-to-surface Skybolt.
•	International Air Transport Association (iata) technical committee
reported it was too early to state with certainty whether commercial supersonic aircraft were practical. Committee said there was a growing possibility that a supersonic airliner could fly within the next few years, but that “considerable research into such matters as sonic boom and cosmic radiation is still required before a final conclusion can be reached.”
•	President Kennedy, replying to question at regular news conference,
said the U.S. had no plans to permit sale of U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance planes to Nationalist China. He added that the U.S. had not sold and would not sell U-2’s to any third nation. Sale of two U-2 aircraft to Nationalist China was arranged in July 1960, during Eisenhower Administration, President Kennedy pointed out.
•	Senator Hubert Humphrey announced public hearing on improve-
ment of Government management of information and coordination of reporting would be conducted by Senate Government Operations Subcommittee on Reorganization and International Organizations, September 20. Among officials testifying would be Melvin Day, Director of nasa Office of Technical Information. September 1J+: mariner ii, U.S. Venus probe, continued to transmit signals from interplanetary space to earth on its nineteenth day of flight, thus surpassing record of U.S.S.R. Venus probe which stopped transmitting on its eighteenth day of flight in February 1961. At 8:00 PM edt the spacecraft was estimated to be 3,067,471 mi. from earth and traveling at a speed of 6,463 mph relative to the earth, jpl scientists said the probe appeared to be continuing “right on course.”
•	In meeting of U.N. Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space,
U.S. offered to U.S.S.R. a 14-lb. metal chunk, believed to be part of sputnik iv, that had landed in Wisconsin September 5. Soviet delegate to the U.N. Platon D. Morozov rejected the offer, saying “We do not know to whom it belongs.” He said it was not necessary to make dramatic gestures to show that falling satellite fragments could do harm, and charged the U.S. with “dramatic staging” to divert the Committee from Soviet proposals on legal principles for use of outer space. Displaying the chunk following the meeting, U.S. delegate Francis T. P. Plimpton said the object weighed 20 lbs. when it fell from the sky, but U.S.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	189
scientists of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory had retained a six-lb. piece for further examination.
September 1J+: House and Senate Conference Committee on FY 1963 appropriations agreed to one half the restoration of nasa funds recommended by Senate, allowing total of $3,674,115,000 for nasa FY 1963 appropriation.
•	nasa announced that nine new astronauts for Projects Gemini and
Apollo would be named at Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston, on September 17.
•	Dr. Wernher von Braun, Director of nasa Marshall Space Flight
Center, said in published interview: “People talk too much about crash programs and too little about sustained support. These space programs take time. A decision you make today on some engineering or scientific aspects of our space program may take anywhere from four to five years before it takes the form of hardware.
“When you make a wrong decision now, the payoff, good or bad, could come five years later, not sooner than that. We can’t work miracles overnight. . . .”
•	In prepared press statement, Astronaut John H. Glenn commented
on September 13 televised remarks by Astronaut Walter Schirra, and said: “I will continue to support his flight [Astronaut Schirra’s orbital flight MA-8] just as well as I possibly can. . . . I don’t want to add any more statements to a situation that has all the aspects of a tempest in a teapot. Scheduling of my time for maximum benefit from a technical and national space program standpoint has been continually reviewed by both Dr. Giiruth and the management of nasa.” Dr. Robert R. Giiruth, Director of nasa Manned Spacecraft Center, stated there was no real controversy over Col. Glenn’s position in the space program or on other questions raised by Cdr. Schirra.

•	Dr. Albert Kelley, nasa Director of Electronics and Control (oart),
told Electronics Industry Association that between 90 and 95% of U.S. space failures could be traced to failures in electronic components. “We are trying to build a reliable spacecraft with unreliable components.” He added that nasa had begun an electronic components’ reliability program separate from that of dod—a program providing a “great challenge” with prospects for rewarding technological payoffs.
•	nasa announced contract award for research in communications
between man and dolphins, results of which could apply if man encounters other species on distant planets. The $80,800, one-year contract was awarded to Communication Institute of St. Thomas, V.I., directed by Dr. John C. Lilly. Dr. Lilly’s research had already determined that dolphins communicate with each other and that they could be taught to mimic human speech.
•	nasa announced new policy under which astronauts would be per-
mitted to negotiate individually for the sale of their stories, the policy being “aimed at assuring equal access by all news media to the Astronauts’ stories of their flight missions.” Notable provisions of new policy were: (1) requirement for a second postflight news conference in which representatives of news media could question the astronaut “in depth” about his flight; and
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	191
(2) prohibiting of any publication’s advertising “exclusive” stories purchased from astronauts, with requirement that the contracting publication provide a method to avoid this inference and with all such agreements subject to approval of the NASA Administrator. Inherent in the policy was that “all information reported by the Astronauts in the course of their official duties, which is not classified to protect the national security, will be promptly made available to the public.” New guidelines applied to all nasa astronauts, civilian and military.
September 16: U.S.S.R. exploded second nuclear device of “several megatons” in two days, aec announced the atmospheric test had been conducted in vicinity of the island Novaya Zemlya.
September 17: nasa’s nine new astronauts were named in Houston by Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, Director of nasa Manned Spacecraft Center (msc).

September 17: Lockheed Aircraft Corp. Board Chairman, Courtlandt S. Gross, wrote to 56,000 employees that the union-shop proposal by President Kennedy’s fact-finding panel was “just plain wrong.” In response to President Kennedy’s plea that Lockheed and three other aerospace companies accede to labor demand for union shop, Gross protested that the “freedom to join or not to join an organization is a basic individual right. . . .” The other three companies—North American Aviation, General Dynamics/Convair Div., and Ryan Aeronautical Co.—reportedly were willing to withdraw their opposition to union shop, and the two unions— United Auto Workers and International Association of Machinists—indicated they would accept the proposed settlement.
•	Federal Radiation Council (Chairman: Anthony J. Celebrezze,
Secretary of hew) announced that radiation exposure greatly above the safety guide levels set two years ago “would not result in a detectable increase in the incidence of disease. . . . The radiation protection guides are not a dividing line between safety and danger in actual radiation situations; nor are they alone intended to set a limit at which protective action should be taken or to indicate what kind of action should be taken.” Individual situations require individual evaluation before action is taken, the council continued.
•	M. G. O’Neil, president of General Tire & Rubber Co., told na-
tional convention of tire dealers that in 10 years astronautics industry may exceed size of combined automotive industries of the world. He compared the impact of the space age to that of the discovery of America in 1492.
•	Reported that telemetry equipment developed for missiles and earth-
orbiting satellites was available to automobile engineers to help make cars quieter. To check noise and vibration accurately, car manufacturers could use two-channel electronic telemetry system that picked up sounds made by test cars and transmitted signals to receiver in another vehicle.
September 18: nasa’s tiros vi weather satellite was placed in orbit by three-stage Delta vehicle launched from Cape Canaveral at 4:45 PM edt (apogee, 442 mi.; perigee, 425 mi.; period, 98.7 min.; inclination, ranging between 58.3° north and south latitude). Orbit was believed too low for satellite’s 9,120 solar cells to be unduly damaged by artificial radiation zone created by U.S. high-altitude nuclear explosion in July. By midafternoon, pictures taken by tiros vi’s two television cameras were being incorporated with ground data into conventional weather forecasts. Weather Bureau reported quality of the photographs was “as good, if not better than that of any taken by the five previous Tiros satellites.” The launching marked the sixth straight success in Tiros program and the eleventh straight successful satellite launching by the Delta rocket.

•	dod announced award of $12.2 million contract to it&t for systems
engineering and technical advice in development of communications satellite systems.
•	Editorial in the New York Times said:
“Since the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is a civilian agency, it might be wiser to make all the astronauts civilians so that no questions of inequality or discrimination arise among them and also so that they might receive more adequate pay than is provided by the low military pay scales. . . .
“In permitting the astronauts to cash in on their exploits, the Kennedy Administration is following an unwise precedent set by the Eisenhower Administration.
“While the practice of profiting from memoirs of Government service is an old one, such memoirs are normally written by persons who have already left Federal employment. . . .
“The government would be far wiser if it paid its astronauts a sufficiently generous salary so that it could in good conscience ask them to observe the same practices of discretion and modesty which have hitherto been considered normal for all other Government employees.”
•	Dr. Ivan A. Getting, President of Aerospace Corp., told National
Rocket Club in Washington that the U.S. space program had been plagued from the beginning by an artificial “dichotomy” that assumed peaceful activities in space were “pure” and mdi-tary activities were “evil.”
“We know, all the world knows, that we have no intention of exploiting space for reasons of aggression. But now the Russians are demonstrating to the world that their space exploits are straightforward demonstrations of raw military power. . . .
“We in the United States need to reaffirm our traditional position—but with pride instead of seeming shame—that our presently great military strength is the most potent force in the world and that it is working 24 hours a day to help keep the peace. ...	_
“If our strength is to be maintained we must have the military tools that are best suited to help keep the peace . . . operational however and whenever and wherever necessary—in space, in the atmosphere, under the seas, or even underground.
“We need to restate the historic peacetime military role of sharing in exploring the frontiers . . . now in space . . . and that this sharing be on a basis of both cooperation and also some healthy competition. ...
“We must recognize that many practical space missions have both military and civilian uses; that the exploitation of space for these missions necessarily involves both the development and continuing operation of these systems, and that as a consequence, each should be evaluated on the basis of how it can be realized most effectively from the standpoint of overall national benefit.

September 21: Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of nasc, told Air Force Association convention in Las Vegas that “the objective of our [national space] policy is to obtain and maintain leadership in space activities for the benefit of man’s freedom, man’s well-being, man’s understanding, and man’s scientific progress. The details of the policy are not quite so clear, as those
196 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
who have studied our budgets and public documents have reason to know. It is clear, however, that our policy includes going to the moon during this decade. It includes developing an operational communications satellite system as well as navigation and meteorological systems on a world-wide basis. The specifics are less clear as to the roles of man in space and what can and should be done to maintain peace in outer space. This lack of clarity, however, is partly due to the difficulty of knowing what can be done and what cannot be done. Continuing efforts will be made to clarify policy, while keeping it necessarily flexible. . . .” September 21: Eeplying to September 20 statement by aec Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg regarding U.S. nuclear propulsion capabilities for a 1970 Mars mission, nasa spokesman said: “There is no such approved program for such a flight at this time, but the joint aec-nasa program is aimed at giving such a capability, and at this time it appears it may be feasible to conduct such a flight.”
•	Announced that International Association Machinist workers and
Lockheed Corp. had agreed to extend their contract indefinitely, thus averting threat of strike in this aerospace industry.

Earlier studies by Armour had indicated the lunar surface may be composed of very strong material.
•	usn announced tests conducted at U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Sta-
tion, China Lake, Calif., had included successful free-flight of a new type of rocket propulsion system called “Hybrid” because of its use of combination liquid and solid propellant in single motor.
•	Two leading U.S. space scientists born in Germany were voted
honorary members of the German Eocket Society: Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of nasa Launch Operations Center, and Prof. K. 0. Lange, Director of University of Kentucky’s Aeronautical Eesearch Laboratory.
•	Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert, addressing the Air
Force Association in Las Vegas, said: “The United States, in keeping with our motivations in freedom and peace, has embarked upon a space program aimed at peace building, constructive exploitation of space—second to none.
“In the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the nation has mobilized an effort unprecedented in history, nasa is making progress, because it has imaginative leadership, a competent staff, extensive facilities, and wholehearted support from all elements of industry and government which can contribute, especially the Air Force.
“In addition to our contribution to the success of the nasa program, the Air Force is required by its own mission to put its energies into a different kind of space effort. We are reaching a clearer definition of that mission as it relates to space. . . .
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1982	197
“The United States is dedicated as a matter of national policy to the peaceful exploitation of the space medium. The United States does not intend to extend the arms race into space.
“We are, however, taking the step to enable us to protect ourselves in the event the Soviets or any other nation were to undertake missions in space that would endanger our security. . ..
“The dual-vehicle orbital experiment of the Soviets, when coupled with their previous claims, seems to indicate that the need for protection against possible threats to our security will be in the near orbital stage of space, rather than farther out. One possible instrument of security that might be useful at this level in space may be found in extending the X-15 and X-20 technology, leading to craft which could operate from surface to orbit and back, and perform defense missions at the edge of the atmosphere. Another might be the permanently manned orbital space station designed for military purposes. Progress toward utilization of such a vehicle for security and protection would be speeded by capitalizing upon the nasa program to acquire knowledge and competence in manned orbital flight. . . .
“These are the principles on which Air Force space program must be based: (a) Ample preparation to utilize the space medium; (b) Ample preparation to defend ourselves in case others choose to extend the threat of aggression to outer space; (c) Concentration on the really important tasks, including today’s job and not just tomorrow’s, and finally, (d) An organizationally disciplined space program—well planned and specific—which fits into overall national plans and objectives.
“We in America have no choice but to extend our defenses as far as they need to be extended to save freedom on earth. . . .”
September 22: Four-stage Journeyman rocket carried 145-lb. payload to 1,058-mi. altitude, from nasa Wallops Station. Primary experiment was measurement of the intensity of RF energy at medium frequencies; secondary experiment was measurement of electron densities in the upper ionosphere and investigation of possibility of using ionosphere as a focusing medium in future radio astronomy mapping experiments. Payload landed about 1,323 mi. from launch site in the Atlantic Ocean.
•	nasa launched three-stage, solid-fuel Ram-B (Radio Attenuation
Measurement) rocket from Wallops Station, Va., all contact with the vehicle lost 11 sec. after second-stage ignition. Project Ram was designed to provide information on communications blackout during space vehicle re-entry.
•	Aerobee 150A launched from nasa Wallops Station, the rocket
reaching 117-mi. altitude in experiment to measure absolute intensity of the spectrum of stars with 50 angstrom resolution and to measure ultraviolet fluxes. No usable data were received because rocket failed to despin as planned.
•	Faulty valve in MA-8 spacecraft was replaced by technicians, a

September 22: Unnamed nasa official said that a four-stage rocket probe would be launched in October or November to check the strength of the radiation belt created by U.S. high-altitude nuclear explosion over the Pacific on July 9, 1962.
•	nasa announced award of facilities grants to five universities, first
such grants awarded by nasa. Worth a total of $6,410,000, the grants were to provide research facilities for activities in space-related sciences and technology to universities making “substantial contributions” to the U.S. space program: University of California, Berkeley; University of Chicago; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; State University of Iowa; and Stanford University.
•	According to the Washington Post, usaf second attempt to orbit
belt of copper filaments in Project West Ford experiment was apparently inadvertently revealed by Eugene C. Fubini, Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. The attempted orbiting was inferred to have been made sometime this summer, failed because of launch vehicle malfunction (first failure and only attempt publicized had been made on Oct. 21, 1961). Of this report, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, Arthur Sylvester, said to the press: “The facts are that only one attempt has been made [to orbit tiny metal filaments] and the U.S. Air Force will coordinate with the National Academy of Sciences on any future attempt.” Confusion had arisen when the Washington Post had reported that the usaf had made an unsuccessful attempt to orbit such a payload during the summer.
•	Review in Red Star by General Pavel Kurochkin, commenting on
new Soviet textbook on strategy, stated: “The Soviet people are engaged in the peaceful conquest of space. But it is perfectly clear that if the imperialists continue to conduct research for means of using cosmic space for military goals, then the interests of guaranteeing the security of the Soviet state demand definite measures from our side.” Doctrinal textbook was written by several of Russia’s top military leaders under the direction of Marshal Y. D. Sokolovsky, and was said to be the first serious work on military strategy published in Russia since 1926.
•	Israel Finance Minister, Levi Eshkol, speaking in Washington, D.C.,
said that the “missile race has entered the Middle East” and Israel must be prepared to defend itself “no matter what the cost.” He said: “When Colonel Nasser stands by Egyptian rocket launchers and boasts they are trained in our direction, we dare not mistake this for an idle propaganda boast.”
September 23: Dr. Charles M. Herzfield, Washington physicist, reported that the luminous particles sighted in space by both Col. John Glenn and Maj. Scott Carpenter probably were particles of solid nitrogen trapped in the extreme upper atmos-
Shere. “As the temperature rises, the luminosity disappears.
To other systems seem to have all the requisite properties. These particles may exist independently at the altitudes involved.

They may be produced from leaks of gas from the capsule or from
fas trapped in various portions of the vehicle. . . Dr.
lerzfield presented his evaluation in report to American Association for the Advancement of Science.
September 23: Soviet Academician Nikolai N. Semenov, Nobel Prize-winning chemist, was quoted as suggesting the moon be made into a major power source for earth. If the moon were covered with semiconductors and photo-elements of high efficiency solar energy falling on the moon could be converted to electrical power far exceeding that produced on earth. He also proposed the moon be made the site for all atomic and thermonuclear power stations, to avoid overheating and irradiating the earth. Research may find a way, he continued, to transmit the power to earth— perhaps by lasers or masers.
September 23-29: Thirteenth International Astronautical Congress was held in Varna, Bulgaria, sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation (iaf). Opening session was marked with pleas by western delegates that U.S.S.R. remove veils of secrecy surrounding her space program.
September 24’ Six-engine S-Iv stage for Saturn space vehicle was successfully static-fired in 60-sec. test at Douglas Missile and Space Systems, Sacramento, Calif.
• Announced that Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr., would study
Eerful light sources in Australia and South Africa, during his -8 orbital flight, nasa said experiment was to determine how well a space traveler could see light sources of known density on earth. Three high-intensity flares would burn at Woomera, Australia, and electric lamps at Durban, So. Africa. Schirra would try to determine effects of atmosphere on light observed from orbital altitude and to establish which light source was more readily visible. Other scientific experiments of the MA-8 flight would be studies of cosmic radiation, search for rare particles in space, and effects of re-entry heating on new materials.
• Reported that, if Astronaut Schirra’s six-orbit flight (MA-8) is fully successful, nasa would conclude Project Mercury with one 18-orbit, 24-hour flight. Present plans called for four 24-hour flights with the one-man Mercury capsule; new plan under consideration would cancel three of these and assign their mission to two-man Gemini capsule.
• fcc Chairman Newton N. Minow invited U.S.S.R. to cooperate in an international television system using high-altitude communications satellites. A high-altitude system would have advantages over low-altitude system such as Telstar, he said in Look magazine, but “we now lack the launching power to make it go.” He proposed that Soviet rockets be used to launch U.S. communications satellites into high-altitude orbits, and added that “this would be a very dramatic area of cooperation for peaceful purposes in space.”
• Congressman John E. Moss, Chairman of the Government Information Subcommittee, wrote to Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara asking why 1959 Army report “Project Horizon” was not yet declassified. Originally classified “Secret,” the study proposing manned lunar program culminating in 1965 lunar landing had 10 separate security reviews by 4 agencies,
200 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
but it was still classified “official use only.” Congressman Moss observed that the House Committee on Science and Astronautics had requested declassified version of “Project Horizon” on Aug. 3, 1961, but had never received it.
September 24: Space Technology Center of General Electric Co. said it was designing an escape system for astronauts to use if orbiting capsule malfunctioned and could not return safely to earth. Called “Moose” (Man Out Of Space Easiest), the system involved use of a “prepackaged spacecraft” consisting of plastic sack, folding heat shield, retrorocket pack, containers of foaming plastic, and a standard parachute. Astronaut, zipped into sack, would step out of faulty spacecraft, aim himself with special scope, and fire the retrorocket. Then his heat shield would unfold and sack would fill with rapid-hardening plastic foam, protecting him from re-entry heat. At 30,000-ft. altitude, he would open parachute and descend slowly to earth.
•	Communications lag between basic researchers and those who apply
the research was cited by Assistant Secretary of Commerce
J.	Herbert Holloman at testimonial dinner for nas president Dr. Frederick Seitz, in Chicago. Mr. Holloman said that communication “throughout the international scientific community” was more rapid than communication between scientists and people working in application of scientific discoveries.
•	afsc announced invention of Bio-telescanner—compact and portable
instrument to determine biological properties of other planetary soil—by Dr. William G. Glenn, sam research immunobiologist, and Wesley E. Prather, electronics expert. Designed to answer basic questions about extraterrestrial life, the instrument would analyze samples gathered by travelers to Mars or other planets and would telemeter its findings back to earth. It could be adapted to operate automatically, to gather and analyze soil samples before man set foot on the planet.

202 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
September 28: Canadian satellite alouette was placed in polar orbit by Thor-Agena B vehicle launched by nasa from Vandenberg afb. Initial orbital data: apogee, 619.2 mi.; perigee, 597 mi.; inclination, 80.84° to the equator; period, 105.4 min. Named for Canadian high-flying songbird, alouette was first satellite both designed and built by a nation other than U.S. or U.S.S.R. Launching was nasa’s first into polar orbit, first from pmr, and first use of Thor-Agena B combination. To sustain its experiments in study of the ionosphere, the 320-lb. alouette had two crossed antennae, one 150 ft. long and the other 75 ft. long.
•	X-15 No. 2 was flown by nasa pilot John B. McKay in longest
engine run to date (127 sec.), the craft reaching 67,000-ft. altitude and 2,693-mph speed (mach 4.08) in successful 9-min. flight near Edwards afb, Calif.

tion, now rapidly approaching the $4 billion mark. In addition to the intensive study the space budget underwent, the committee also conducted 26 investigations, issued 16 reports, held 124 days of hearings, and heard 236 witnesses.
“Indicative of the committee’s activity is the more than
2,175,000	words of testimony taken this year incorporated into approximately 3,860 pages of printed hearings. . . .”
September 29: nasa Administrator James E. Webb announced that the project management of the liquid hydrogen-fueled Centaur launch vehicle and the hydrogen-fueled M-l rocket engine would be transferred from Marshall Space Flight Center to the Lewis Research Center. Studies were being initiated to adapt Centaur as a stage to other boosters. Mr. Webb said: “The transfer will allow the Marshall Center to concentrate its efforts on the Saturn vehicles for the manned lunar landing program. ... It will permit the Lewis Research Center to use its experience in liquid hydrogen to further the work already done on one of the most promising high-energy rocket fuels and its application to Centaur and the M-l.”
•	usaf launched satellite from pmr with Thor-Agena booster.
•	At the 13 th Congress of the International Astronautical Federation

September SO: nasa launched Aerobee sounding rocket from Wallops Station, the 259-lb. instrumented payload reaching 106-mi. altitude in test to map sources of photons in specific wavelengths in the nighttime sky. Payload landed about 61 mi. downrange, with recovery not attempted.
•	Tropical storm developed 420 mi. east of Puerto Rico, traveling on
path that would cross impact area for Astronaut Schirra’s third orbit, nasa flight officials were closely watching the storm to determine whether it would necessitate postponing Schirra’s MA-8 flight scheduled for Oct. 3.
During September: Conclusion that wheel-shaped space station was technically feasible and identification of problems that still exist were revealed in nasa Technical Note D-1504, compilation of 11 papers by nasa Langley Research Center staff. Selection of this 150-ft.-diameter, 171,000-lb. structure was result of studies by Langley for more than 2 years and detailed analyses by North American Aviation, Inc., for past 6 months. The report indicated the space station primarily would provide a means of learning to live in space, where zero-gravity and variable-gravity experiments could be performed, closed life-support systems could be qualified, and rendezvous techniques and systems developed. Chosen model could support up to 38-man crew.
•	Issue of ars’ Astronautics contained series of articles by nasa
Langley Research Center scientists and others, reviewing LaRC research program on manned space-station technology since early 1960.
•	Search for two huge meteorites believed to have fallen in western
Virginia near Covington and West Virginia near Clarksburg was conducted by Dr. Frank Drake, Director of National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank, W. Va. Reports by wit-
204 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
nesses indicated that the meteorites weighed^about one ton each and that they fell in sparsely populated, national forest areas. During September: Dr. Joshua Lederberg, of Stanford University, and Dr. Carl Sagan, former University of California professor, wrote in September Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that large amounts of moisture may be frozen into the subsoil of the planet Mars. From openings in the planet’s crust, steam and gas may escape and create hot spots that would be “favorable microenvironments for life.” They said that recurrent clouds detected by telescope “may be symptomatic of this local outgassing of water vapor.”
•	Dr. John W. Findlay, deputy director of the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, W. Va., said Echo-type reflective orbiting balloon and West Ford-type copper-needle belts were potential threats to science of radio astronomy. Writing in Science magazine, Dr. Findlay said these objects would contribute to “noise” in radiotelescope reception and “would cut down sharply on an antenna’s ability to receive faint signals.”
•	Army Corps of Engineers announced that Launch Complex 12 at
Cape Canaveral would be modified to service larger and more sophisticated space vehicles. Complex 12 was used to launch Mariner and Ranger space probes.
•	World’s first regularly scheduled Hovercraft transportation service
ended. Operating since July with 8 round trips daily from Rhyl, Wales, to Wallasey, England, the experiment proved Vickers Armstrong 24-passenger Hovercraft could successfully negotiate soft sand and shallows as well as deeper water. Hovercraft rides 8 in. above surface (land or sea) on cushion of air.
•	Secret of radio emissions from planet Jupiter was proposed by
physicists Dr. Leon Landovitz of Yeshiva Univ. and Dr. Leona Marshall, New York Univ. They suggest that perhaps Jupiter acts as a gigantic maser, using energy from the sun as its “pumping” energy, to produce the decameter waves. They proposed that Jupiter’s decameter radiation was based on principle that the change of state of an electron with respect to static magnetic field results in either emission or absorption of electromagnetic energy, such as light or radio waves, at frequency that depends upon the magnetic field. There may be a “cascading” of such stimulated emissions from the electrons as the disturbance propagates through the electrically charged layer of Jupiter’s atmosphere, Dr. Marshall stated. Jupiter’s emission of radio waves was discovered in 1955 by Dr. Bernard Burke and Dr. Kenneth L. Franklin, then of Carnegie Institution of Washington.
•	Seven X-15 pilots and Paul F. Bickle, Director of nasa Flight
Research Center, were awarded the first John J. Montgomery Award for aerospace achievement by the National Society of Aerospace Professionals and the Aerospace Museum of San Diego. The X-15 pilots were : Scott Crossfield, naa; Maj. Robert M.

During September: Ground rehearsals for onr-nsf-nasa Stratoscope II balloon-carried telescope experiment took place in Norwalk, Conn., the 36-in. telescope focusing on the planet Jupiter. Later in month, telescope was disassembled and transported to Palestine, Tex., where it would remain in hangar until first flight, in February or March 1963. To be lifted above,most of the earth’s atmosphere by two balloons, telescope would be stabilized at 80,000-ft. altitude throughout each observing night, where it will make a variety of astronomical and planetary observations.
OCTOBER 1962
October 1: Fourth official anniversary of nasa, charged by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to organize and conduct U.S. space exploration for peaceful purposes.

•	Project Mercury flight officials studied tropical storm “Daisy,”
which continued moving westnorthwest about 300 mi. east of Puerto Rico, the general landing area for third orbit of Astronaut Walter M. Schirra’s six-orbit MA-8 flight planned Oct. 3. Mercury Operations Director Walter C. Williams, indicating continuing surveillance of “Daisy,” ordered preparations for the launch attempt to continue.
•	nasa Administrator James E. Webb, addressing the Greater Hart-
ford (Conn.) Chamber of Commerce, said that the “habit of oversimplifying has carried over into the evaluation and understanding of our objectives in space. . . . Many of our citizens believe our major, and in some cases, our only purpose in space, to be one of winning, in a contest with the Soviet Union, ‘a race to the moon.’ . . . [This concept] overlooks the significant and seldom appreciated fact that learning how to get to the moon, developing the technology which will be required to get there, and employing this technology for many purposes in space, is more important than the lunar landing itself. . . .
“Characterization of our effort solely as a ‘space race to the moon’ also leads to the mistaken notion that the nation first to conduct a lunar exploration will have assured itself of ultimate and enduring superiority in space. The fact is overlooked that landing men on the moon, although a great and challenging goal, is only one of many goals in space. . . .
“With the resources which are being applied, and knowledge of how those resources are being utilized to mobilize our nation’s scientific, technical and industrial strength, I am confident that we will achieve a space posture satisfactory to the United States given a continuation of our present efforts and support for those planned for future years. On the basis of what we know now of the scope of the Soviet Union’s efforts, and of what is required to do the job, this country has a better than even chance to conduct the first manned exploration of the moon. For these reasons, I have said I believe we will be there first.
“But in saying this I do not want to fall into the same trap which has snared too many of us—that of again inviting a characterization of this broad and vital national effort as a spectacular ‘race to the moon.’”
He pointed out that President Kennedy did not set the national goal of “landing the first man on the moon.” Rather, the President “stated our determination to attain ‘a position of pre-206
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1902	207
eminence in space’ and to become the world’s leading spacefaring nation ....
“That is our objective—to develop superior competence in space which will be available for any national purpose which may be required, whether it be the peaceful utilization of space for the benefit of mankind, or to keep the peace and forestall its exploitation by any nation for aggressive purposes . . . .”
October 1: Nova launch facilities study contract was awarded to Martin-Marietta Corp., Denver, by nasa Marshall Space Flight Center. The study assumes Nova will be launched from Cape Canaveral.
October 2: explorer xiv satellite was launched into orbit by Thor-Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral on mission to study natural and man-made radiation in space, nasa spokesmen said satellite appeared to be following the planned orbital path (53,000-mi. apogee, 185-mi. perigee, 31-hr. period), but scientists could not confirm the exact orbital figures for several days (later confirmed as 61,000-mi. apogee, 175-mi. perigee, 36.1-hr. period). The 89-lb. satellite was injected into orbit at nearly 24,000-mph speed by the three-stage Thor-Delta. This was Delta’s 12th straight successful satellite launching.
•	20th anniversary of first military jet-powered flight in the U.S.,

•	Project Mercury operations director Walter C. Williams ordered
launch countdown to continue toward MA-8 launch at Cape Canaveral the following morning. Weather conditions which had been under surveillance were considered generally favorable, and all elements of the six-orbit manned space mission were in a “go condition.”
•	Nuclear physicist Dr. Edward Teller told 1962 conference of upi
editors and publishers that recent U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific had “not been quite satisfactory” and that it was his guess “that the Kussians are ahead of us in the nuclear race today.”
•	nasa Administrator James E. Webb, addressing the Northeast
Commerce and Industry Exposition in Boston, said:
“The achievement of . . . [U.S. pre-eminence in space] requires that we learn to travel in space as we have learned to travel on the sea or in the air. We must develop what might be termed space power—the capability to utilize space for every purpose which our national interest may require. And, to fulfill the directives established by the Congress, we must develop that competence in space for the benefit of our own people, and of all mankind ....
“Although creative individual effort is as important today as it has ever been, and the imagination and initiative of the individual remain the primary source of scientific and technical progress, the development and perfection of the complex equipment, the systems and subsystems which are taking men into space are rarely, if ever, the work of single individuals. Today, teams of talented and imaginative technicians are joined in each major technological achievement . . .
208 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
October 2: Thomas F. Dixon, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator, addressed the Southern Governors’ Conference, Hollywood-by-the-Sea, Fla., on the role of the South in the Space Age, and remarked:	. . our space activities are in no sense stunts—
spectaculars, if you will—nor will the landing of U.S. astronauts on the moon be our ultimate objective. Father, the national effort is broadly organized to accomplish rapid advances in science and technology that will make it possible for us to perform any space assignment—military or civilian—that the national interest might require. Furthermore, from lunar exploration, we will go on to wider exploration of the solar system, ventures whose end no man can foresee. ...”
•	International Association of Machinists rejected contract offer of
Aerojet-General Corp. and began a strike. In Washington, a Presidential committee opened talks on labor dispute between IAM and the Boeing Co. United Auto Workers employed by North American Aviation, Inc., had accepted a three-year contract, thus averting strike.

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	209
9 hrs., 14 min. after blastoff. Within 40 min. after landing he and his spacecraft were safely aboard aircraft carrier U.S.S. Kearsarge.
Highly successful MA-S flight proved the feasibility of (1) prolonged weightless flight in space and (2) drifting in orbit without consumption of hydrogen-peroxide attitude control fuel and without physically endangering the astronaut. Schirra, who spent a total of hrs. in drifting flight, reported there were no unusual attitude control problems during drifting.
Various other scientific experiments during MA-8 flight included astronaut’s sighting of luminous particles in space, also reported by Astronauts John H. Glenn and M. Scott Carpenter; and photographing cloud formations with a special hand camera.
sigma 7 was sighted by observers on Indian Ocean tracking ship for five min. as the spacecraft made its third orbit more than 100 mi. high. The observers said sigma 7 appeared almost as bright as Venus. This was the first reported visual sighting of a manned spacecraft during orbital flight.
Only technical difficulty of tbe entire operation was attaining proper adjustment of Schirra’s spacesuit coolant supply and failure of body temperature measurements in first orbit. However, desired suit temperatures were achieved early in second orbit.
October 3: In press conference following MA-8, D. Brainerd Holmes, nasa Director of Manned Space Flight, said: “This was a highly successful flight, magnificently performed. It proved there is no substitute for sound engineering and thorough training.”
Walter C. Williams, msc Director of Mercury Operations, said that “so far as I am concerned, the mission was perfect.” He added that the next Mercury mission would be a 24-hour flight in early 1963.
•	Soviet Foreign Ministry told U.S. Embassy in Moscow that the
“Soviet Union will not undertake any action that might hinder the flight of the American spaceman Walter Schirra.” The Soviets were replying to U.S. note requesting the U.S.S.R. to refrain from nuclear tests during the MA-8 flight.
•	President Kennedy appointed Dr. Frederick Seitz to his Science
Advisory Committee. Dr. Seitz, president of the National Academy of Sciences, succeeded Dr. Detlev W. Bronk on the committee.	_

October 7: Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr., after arriving in Houston after trip from Pacific landing of six-orbit MA-8 flight, held press conference at Rice University auditorium: “My intention was to use so little [attitude control] fuel that no one could argue that we [had not] had enough fuel aboard sigma 7 for eighteen orbits, if we wanted it. I think I proved that point.” He said MA-8 was a “textbook flight” and that ho was sorry to see it end.
On the issue of space sickness, Astronaut Schirra stated that despite the prolonged weightlessness of this longest U.S. manned space flight, “there was no problem at all. There was no break-off phenomena, there was no uneasiness, there was no queasiness. I felt great.
“The suit temperature problem . . . is a problem which we have solved. I have been much hotter in the tent at Cape Canaveral than I ever, ever thought of being in sigma 7.”
He reported sighting the “fireflies” and believing they emanated from the spacecraft.
•	New York Times reported That more than 20 fragments from

•	Beginning of two-month-long Project Firefly under usaf Cambridge
Research Laboratories, the project involving about 30 research rockets carryi ng various chemical payloads to altitudes of from 50 to 150 mi. Some of the payloads were intended to create higher-than-normal electron density in ionosphere for communications studies. Other payloads were designed to remove electrons from the F-layer to generate a “hole” in the ionosphere. Other released chemicals would interact with ambient elements to produce glow; observation of glow at night would enable tracking and measuring of upper-atmosphere winds. Mixtures exploding at high altitudes would permit observation of shock-wave perturbations of the ionosphere. Vehicles used included approximately 16 Nike-Cajuns, 9 Honest John-Nikes, and 5 Aerobee 150’s. Launchings were from Eglin afb, Fla.
•	Dr. Siegfried J. Bauer of nasa Goddard Space Flight Center, one
of the scientists who discovered existence of 900-mi.-thick helium layer in the atmosphere, offered explanation of usaf probe’s failure to detect helium layer, usaf Cambridge Research Laboratories probe did not detect helium layer because the probe was launched at night, when the layer is so thin that the instruments used could not detect it. According to Dr. Bauer, even in daytime, helium layer will become relatively thin during periods of minimum solar activity and relatively thick during periods of maximum solar activity. Dr. Bauer feels the layer will not be detected by standard ionosphere probing but will necessitate use of special instrumentation.

The final decision has not been made, but in the meantime, we are proceeding with the lunar orbit rendezvous approach.”
October 16: Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert, addressing National Rocket Club, asserted: “Developing the right kind of space program is a continuing job in the Department of Defense. . . . The difficulties encountered do not relate to problems of principle. The problems are questions of specifics. There are tough decisions of choice to be made. We have to weigh effects on other activities, make careful estimates as to time, determine rates and select the projects to be pursued. . . . The current rate of investment in space by the Department of Defense reflects our best judgment as to which projects are dictated by specific requirements and those which should be carried on for general development purposes. ... As projects become more precisely defined and funding and time estimates can be firmed, and as requirements become clearer and more specific, then efforts are focused on those most pressing and most promising. . . .”

October 21±: nasa test pilot Joseph A. Walker, key speaker at 40th Anniversary and 1962 Annual Meeting of National Aeronautic Association in Washington, said: “I feel very strongly that the source of our strength in the air in commerce and in National Defense is gradually drying up. Looking at the attrition of small airports, the cost of flight instruction, the attitude of local residents near airports, and the increasing restrictions upon use of airspace and facilities, I cannot help becoming alarmed. . . . The supply of individuals with skills capable of supplying the demand for pilots will inevitably decrease from old age and retirement. . . .
“Two things are apparent. One, that the present outlook is gloomy. Two, that history and foresight give us grounds for expecting that there will be plenty of need for pilots in space as well as in the atmosphere. . . . The need for pilots will not be confined to the cockpit. Engineers with pilot training have a better understanding of the cockpit problems. We need the understanding of the cockpit problem in operations, in maintenance and repair, in management and in planning. Beyond doubt, pilot experience can be an effective tool and augment business administration as well as engineering and accounting. . . .
“The space programs are depending upon qualified, experienced test pilots. It is my belief that they don’t happen, they are made, and they are made just about the time of the first solo.”

National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank, W. Va., had recently detected in one day as many radio signals from Jupiter as smaller instruments have recorded in a month. Source of Jupiter’s long-wave radio signals was still unresolved.
October 27: explorer xv energetic particles satellite (S-3b) placed in orbit by Thor-Delta vehicle launched from Cape Canaveral. Initial orbital data: apogee, 10,960 mi.; perigee, 193.7 mi.; period, 315.3 min.; inclination, 18.02° to the equator; velocity at apogee, 6,015 mph; velocity at perigee, 21,598 mph. Launched to study artificial radiation belt created by U.S. high-altitude nuclear explosion in July, the 98-lb. satellite was similar to explorer xii and explorer xiv which successfully measured energetic particles of natural radiation belts. Although satellite achieved orbit within predicted estimated range, it was spinning on its axis about 10 times faster than the planned 10-rpm rate. Unnamed spokesman said: “We have a high spin rate. It may well be that we’ll receive acceptable data from the main experiments, with some secondary experiments not able to function. . . . We won’t know for certain until we have made a thorough study of data over a period of days.” explorer xv carried experiments on magnetic field, ion-electron, electron flux, and distribution in pitch angle of electrons; transmitter; optical attitude sensor; and solar cells, including solar-cell damage experiment. Launching marked 13th successful satel-lite-orbitingby NASA-developed Delta vehicle.

October 30: Oran W. Nicks, nasa Director of Lunar and Planetary Programs, summarized results obtained from marines ii scientific experiments, at Eighth Tri-Service Conference on Electromagnetic Compatibility in Chicago: “One of the primary scientific objectives in measuring magnetic fields in interplanetary space is to determine the magnitude and direction of the steady field component. . . . The Mariner has indicated a typical steady state transverse component of ten gamma or less, and it has clearly shown how the transverse field becomes large (as high as 25 gamma) during geomagnetic storms. In addition to this, the Mariner 2 has provided information on the steady interplanetary field indicating that the radial component is apparently more stable, even under storm conditions, and that there are quiet times when the radial component from the sun is essentially constant. . . . Measurements from the ion chamber [onboard marines ii] have indicated an average radiation level as expected, corresponding to about 1.1 milli-roentgen per hour (about 100 times the cosmic ray intensity at the surface of the earth).... It has been reported by measurements [of the probe’s cosmic dust detector] thus far that the flux of interplanetary dust particles is at least one thousand times less in interplanetary space than in the near vicinity of the earth. The cause of this is unknown. . . . Preliminary data from the [solar plasma detector in the] Mariner indicate abrupt changes in the velocity and intensity of solar winds, and correlated effects on the magnetic fields in space. Measurements show that the particle energies generally range from about 750 electron volts to 2500 electron volts, although some plasma with an energy of 3225 electron volts has been observed. These variations almost certainly were the results of events on the sun, but the exact nature of these events is not yet understood. . . .”

NOVEMBER 1962
November 1: U.S.S.R. announced it had launched mars i, a 1,970-lb. space probe on seven-month flight to Mars. Launched with an “improved booster” into parking orbit around the earth, mars i was hurled into escape trajectory when vehicle engines re-ignited. Tass reported mars i was flying as planned on its course toward Mars. “All systems are functioning normally and orders sent to the station [i.e., probe] are well received and obeyed.” Main tasks of the probe were interplanetary exploration, establishment of interplanetary space radio communications, photographing the Martian surface and relaying the photographs back to earth by radio. “Telemetric, measuring, and scientific instrumentation will be automatically activated in conformity with the flight program by radio commands from the earth,” Tass said. The flight had been preceded by an unsuccessful launch attempt the previous week, unidentified dod sources said, (nasa Administrator James E. Webb stated in September that two Soviet attempts to launch Mars probes had failed in October 1960.)
•	nasa reported radiation satellite explorer xv, launched Oct. 27,
was spinning at rate of 73 rpm instead of desired 10 rpm because of failure of despin weights to deploy. Preliminary data indicated all experiments were functioning and that all received data were of good quality. Effect of high spin rate on experimental results was under analysis.
•	High-altitude nuclear test in U.S. Operation Dominic was made in
Pacific test area, the sub-megaton device carried by Thor rocket to estimated altitude of 30 to 40 miles, aec reported two Soviet nuclear explosions also occurred, one a high-altitude test over central Asia and the other an atmospheric test over Soviet Arctic.
•	Development of new type of laser by General Electric and Inter-
national Business Machine researchers was reported in American Physical Society’s Physical Review Letters and American Institute of Physics’ Applied Physics Letters. Called “injection laser,” new crystal laser was powered by electrical current; previous solid lasers used strong flash lamps as energy source. At least 10 times more efficient than existing lasers, injection laser was expected to enable engineers to broadcast audio messages on the beams of light and to modulate the brightness of the light according to voice, television, or other pattern. Researchers anticipated that single laser beam could transmit a million telephone messages or a thousand television channels.

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	229
November 1-3: First NASA-University Conference on the Science and Technology of Space Exploration held in Chicago, with 1,181 educators and scientists representing nasa Headquarters, nasa field installations, and other Government agencies, as well as more than 300 colleges and universities.
November 1: Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator, speaking at NASA-University Conference in Chicago, said nasa needed help from universities in four main areas: space sciences, manned space flight, applications of earth satellites to communications and meteorology, and advanced research and technology. “Our educational institutions bear a major responsibility for the success of our national effort to explore space. Our universities and colleges are called upon to produce a body of scientists and engineers of unexcelkd competence. Some of these graduates will enter governmental service with nasa and other agencies participating in the space program; some will join private research organizations and industrial corporations.
“But some must remain at the universities where they continue to advance knowledge and produce new talent. This last function should receive high priority. The government laboratory, industry, and research foundation all are users of creative and talented men without reproducing this vital national resource. The university alone is the producer of new engineers and scientists.”
•	Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Director of Space Sciences, addressed
NASA-University Conference on the Science and Technology of Space Exploration, Chicago: “During the first four years of the existence of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 157 sounding rockets, 55 satellites, and 9 space probes have been launched and have yielded a tremendous amount of information in all of the areas of interest. Many hundreds of research papers have appeared in the open scientific literature and a considerable portion of the scientific community, both national and international, has become involved in the effort to make the most of the opportunities afforded by the space program for the conduct of important research. It is hoped that the university community will continue to find new and challenging opportunities and will continue to increase and strengthen its participation which has already become a major element in the success of the program so far.”
•	Dr. T. L. K. Smull, Director of nasa Grants and Research Contracts,
addressed NASA-University Conference on policies and procedures of NASA-University grants and research contracts: “The basic principle of all nasa policy regarding its relationships with universities is that nasa wishes to work within the structure of the universities in a way that will strengthen the university and at the same time make it possible for nasa to accomplish its mission. . . . nasa hopes to conduct its joint activities in a manner that will preserve and strengthen the universities’ educational role. This basic policy is interwoven in the policies and procedures of nasa support of research, facilities, and training.
“. . . nasa support of activities in the universities has approximately doubled each year since nasa was organized. During Fiscal Year 1962 some $40 million were committed for these
230 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
activities. Of this $40 million, $2 million was utilized to initiate the training grant program; $6’£> million was used to initiate the facilities grant program; and some $3}£ million was utilized for the special purpose research grants. The rest of the funds supported project type research. . . .
“It is expected that the university involvement in nasa activities during the current fiscal year will be more than double that of FY 1962. . . .”
November 2: James E. Webb, nasa Administrator, and the nasa astronauts were honored at Explorers Club’s Night of Exploration dinner in New York. Addressing the club on nasa programs and goals, Mr. Webb said: “Curiosity—the driving human thirst for knowledge—is only one reason, of course, for undertaking space exploration on the scale and at the pace which our country has established. . . .
“First, we seek for mankind the benefits inherent in the scientific and technological knowledge and dexterity that will emerge from this dynamic effort to conquer the most hostile environment that man has ever entered—and to use that knowledge and technical skill as an important new resource for human progress.
“Second, we seek to maintain our position as leader of the Free World, through continued superiority in science and technology.
“And, finally, we seek space power as a deterrent to any potential adversary who might attempt to exploit space as an avenue of aggression against us . . . .”
•	Transatlantic use of telstar communications satellite was dis-
continued for about seven weeks. During this period, telstar’s orbit brought it too briefly on line of sight with North America and Europe for useful transmission, at&t said the situation would recur every six months. Domestic transmissions would be suspended only from Nov. 26 to Dec. 2, during which time ground equipment would be “tuned up.”
•	Unnamed nasa spokesman said mariner ii was sending “about 90
kinds of information” from interplanetary space, despite power drop of Oct. 31. Officials were “pretty optimistic” Venus-bound probe could renew experiments turned off because of drop in voltage of the spacecraft’s power system.
•	dod announced anna geodetic satellite was functioning properly and
its orbit was “near perfect.” anna’s flashing fight system would be tested Nov. 4 with single series of five flashes triggered by onboard command. Full-scale operation of all systems would begin within a week with anna’s flashing fight series triggered by ground command from Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Laboratory, Md.
•	Soviet academician M. Sissakian, Presidium member of Soviet
Academy of Sciences, was quoted as saying U.S.S.R. hoped to bring mars i back to earth.
•	H. Julian Allen, Assistant Director of nasa Ames Research Center,
proposed at NASA-University conference in Chicago that interplanetary spacecraft be cone-shaped and that they enter the atmosphere point-end-first. The originator of concept for returning orbital spacecraft blunt-end-first, Allen stated: “Blunt vehicles are desirable when you are dealing with speeds of the sub-orbital range up to speeds required to escape the effects of
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	231
the earth’s gravity. But when entry speeds exceed this range, as they probably will on return to the earth from trips to other planets, radiation heating drives you away from very blunt bodies, such as the Mercury capsule, to bodies with conical noses. . . . Our concepts of aerodynamic flow, in short, must change as the velocities with which we are dealing increase. . . .”
November 2: Rep. Charles S. Gubser (Calif.) announced nasa and usn had agreed to convert an old dirigible hangar at Moffett Field, Calif., for production of Rift nuclear vehicle stage. Hangar was located about two mi. from prime Rift contractor, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co., and adjacent to nasa Ames Research Center.
•	Douglas-built S-IVB stage, originally conceived only as third stage

ningham Trophy for being selected as the Marine Aviator of the Year. Mercury Astronaut Glenn orbited the earth three times in first U.S. manned orbital flight MA-6, February 20, 1962.
November 8: mariner ii interplanetary probe reported data showing that interplanetary space was free of cosmic dust and debris found in vicinity of earth, Dr. William H. Pickering, director of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told press interviewers. “On this basis, one has to think of the earth as moving in its own cloud of dust,” Dr. Pickering added.
•	Aec announced 31st nuclear explosion by U.S.S.R. in current test
series, an atmospheric detonation of intermediate-range yield.
•	Four “hot spots” on the moon were reported discovered by Bruce
Murray and Robert Wildey of Cal Tech, using new telescope with heat-sensitive, gold-plated mirror to detect infrared radiation. The two space scientists speculated that hot spots could indicate large areas of bare rock exposed on the lunar surface. Spots were discovered during survey of the moon which also revealed the lunar surface gets colder at night than previously believed, —270°F compared to —243°F recorded by earlier heat-measuring devices. Murray said the new evidence could mean there are prominences of heat-retaining rock protruding through thick dust layer on lunar surface.
•	nasa announced Col. George M. Knauf (usaf), Deputy Director of
Space Medicine in nasa Office of Manned Space Flight, has retired from usaf and accepted appointment to same position as a civilian. Dr. Knauf was responsible for much of development and organization of Project Mercury medical recovery support operation.
November Soviet news agency Tass reported mars i probe was
606,000	mi. from earth (at 4:00 PM est) and was increasing that distance by 215,000 mi. a day. Soviet observatories photographed the Mars probe and its carrier rocket on Nov. 3; director of Crimean Astrophysical Observatory said this was the first time moving artificial interplanetary bodies had been photographed from earth.

•	U.S. transferred to Dominican Republic its rocket tracking station
at Sabana, D.R. Formerly used to track missiles launched from Cape Canaveral toward Ascension Island, the facility would be used as a training center.	_	_
•	First ground-controlled flashes from anna geodetic satellite were
delayed because delivery of command equipment to Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory had been delayed.
•	Thomas Dixon, Deputy Associate Administrator of nasa, told
Liquid Propulsion Symposium in San Francisco that nasa was studying large liquid-propellant rocket engines, beyond the 1.5 million-lb.-thrust F-l engine, that would be necessary for manned planetary flight. Pointing out the unacceptability of simply scaling up the F-l engine to produce the required 20 to 30 million-lb. thrust, since it would then measure about 60 ft. high and 45 ft. nozzle diameter, Dixon cited need for “new and imaginative approaches for propulsion in the future .... nasa will emphasize advanced research that could culminate in the development of these giant engines for the future.” He added that current nasa research projects in advanced propulsion were making progress. “These studies will assess current work on advanced propulsion concepts and point out areas where new concepts need to be investigated.”	_	_

November 7: nasa announced selection of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. to build lunar excursion module (lem) of the three-man Apollo spacecraft. In announcing the selection, nasa Administrator James E. Webb said: “We are affirming our tentative decision of last July . . . using lunar orbit rendezvous as the prime mission mode to accomplish initial manned lunar flight. . . . Studies [of alternate approaches], now completed, along with a great deal of related analyses . . . during the intervening months, make us confident that our present course is the proper one.” D. Brainerd Holmes, Deputy Associate Administrator of nasa and Director of Manned Space Flight added that more than 1,000,000 man-hours of some 700 scientists, engineers, and researchers had been devoted to studies of the Apollo mission. . . The results of these studies added up to the conclusion that lunar orbit rendezvous is the preferable mode to undertake.” Apollo lunar spacecraft will be composed of command module, service module, and lunar excursion module.
•	nasa fired two experimental rockets into upper atmosphere within a
half-hour of each other, to obtain a comparison of electron density profile with wind profile measured at about the same time. First rocket, two-stage Nik e-Cajun, attained 82-mi. altitude with a 55-lb. payload to obtain measurements of electron density and electron temperature in ionosphere at night. Second experiment, using two-stage Nike-Apache, involved use of sodium vapor clouds to measure atmospheric winds and diffusion; rocket reached 34-mi. altitude before ejecting its vapor cloud, which extended to peak altitude of 103 mi. Twin launchings, conducted at nasa Wallops Station, marked first time such experiments were conducted together. Experiments were conducted by nasa Goddard Space Flight Center and Geophysics Corporation of America.
•	Advanced usaf missile, Atlas F, was successfully fired more than

tory and Texas a&m Activation Analysis Laboratory would conduct nasa- and AEC-funded research in methods of determining chemical composition of lunar surface.
First week in November: Armour Eesearch Foundation reported to nasa that surface of the moon may not be covered with layers of dust. Initial Armour studies indicated dust particles become harder and denser in higher-vacuum environment such as that of moon, but studies had not proved that particles eventually become bonded together in rock-like substance as vacuum increased.
November 8: Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Goldstone Tracking Station turned on mariner ii’s four interplanetary experiments by command, when the Venus-bound spacecraft was 14.6 million mi. from earth. The scientific instruments—magnetometer, ion chamber and particle-flux detector, cosmic dust detector, and solar spectrometer—were turned off Oct. 31 to conserve power when onboard voltage drop was noted. Experiments were resumed when telemetry from mariner ii indicated onboard

•	nasa Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden, addressing General
Session of U.S. Savings and Loan League in Washington, said: “. . . What we are buying in our national space program is the knowledge, the experience, the skills, the industrial facilities, and the experimental hardware that will make the United States first in every field of space exploration—scientific and practical uses, including military applications. And to accomplish this result we must make advances at the frontiers of knowledge in nearly every field of science and technology which will project new ideas into our whole industrial system. . . .
“The success of the National Space Program hinges on the ability of the American people, through their government, their industry, and their privately endowed institutions, to implement many difficult tasks. Not one or two men will make the landing on the moon, but, figuratively, the entire Nation.
“And our ultimate success also depends, in some measure, on our ability to enlist the cooperation of other nations in this enor-
236 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
mous undertaking. An important (but certainly not determining) consideration in our international programs is winning and cementing friendly relations with our allies in the Free World and among the uncommitted nations. This we do by demonstration of our peaceful objectives and our willingness to share what we learn from space exploration with the scientific community the world around. . . .
“The investment in space progress is big and will grow, but the potential returns on the investment are even larger. And because it concerns us all, scientific progress is everyone’s responsibility. Every citizen should understand what the space program really is about and what it can do. . . .”
November 8: Speaking before mit School of Industrial Management, nasa Manned Space Flight Director D. Brainerd Holmes said: “The major national problem today is not a lack of technological or economic resources. It is a lack of trained and courageous minded men. For this reason, the integration of our human, economic, and technological resources is basically a manpower problem. We need a special kind of man.
“This kind of man not only combines general and scientific training and general management with technical experience, but he has the true courage of his convictions. Above all, he must be tireless and devoted and not give in to compromisers and obstructionists. Technical people may not necessarily be the best managers, but in this age of technology if you do not have the technical answers jmu cannot make good decisions. This is the vital point I want to stress to you today. . . .
“We need group research, group engineering, and group science. But we also badly need individual creativity. In short, we need to utilize effectively all of our available capabilities, regardless of the channels they take. We must integrate group and individual efforts.”
•	Lt. Col. Joseph A. Connor, Jr. (usaf) of nasa Office of Manned

Agena from Point Arguello, Calif.
• Catalogue of Astronomical Photographs featuring close-up photo-
graphs of moon, was released by Lick Observatory. Each photograph showed area 230 mi. by 280 mi. on scale of 30 mi. to the inch (view of lunar surface from 300 mi.). Lick spokesman said precise optical and guidance systems, high magnification, and skilled use of modern astrophotographic techniques were used to obtain the pictures. The 120-in. reflecting telescope at Lick is world’s second largest.
•	In interview at Soviet Academy of Sciences, Soviet physicist Dr.
Sergei N. Vernov stated he believed particle acceleration accounts for outer radiation belt of the earth. Deep-space probes have not detected enough high-energy particles to prove the outer belt is replenished by high-energy particles ejected from the sun. Dr. Vernov believes the particles acquire their energy within the belt—through some as yet unknown accelerating mechanism. He believes there are two such means of acceleration, one sustaining the day-to-day energy level and the other accounting for its increases when a cloud of erupted solar gas reaches vicinity of earth, causing magnetic storms. Dr. Vernov suggested inner belt is sustained by protons formed by neutrons which decay upon bombardment by cosmic rays; some of the high-energy protons are trapped by earth’s magnetism to become the inner radiation belt.
•	Moscow radio reported Soviet designers were working on airplane
that flies by flapping its wings like a bird. The plane was expected to have 10 to 30 times lifting power of similar-size conventional plane.
November 12: nasa Flight Research Center released photographs of “lifting body” experimental wingless craft to test landing techniques in gliding from altitudes as high as 5,000 ft. The 24-ft.-by-13-ft. craft would begin testing early in 1963, first with truck to tow it aloft and later with airplane as towing vehicle. Made mostly of plywood, the 500-lb. craft suggests shape of missile nose cone cut in half lengthwise.

•	Rocket-powered instruments will be traveling as far as Jupiter by
1975, Robert J. Parks, director of jpl Planetary Programs, said in interview. Parks said by 1975 the planets Mars and Venus probably would have been studied “quite closely” by instruments.
•	Congressman Joseph E. Karth (Minn.), chairman of space sciences
subcommittee, said in press interview that planned mission schedule for Saturn launch vehicle “doesn’t appear to be the best way to use a vehicle on which we have spent so much money.” Mr. Karth said the powerful vehicle might prove useful in “speeding up the interplanetary research program, which may not be ambitious enough.”
•	Albert J. Evans, nasa Deputy Director of Aeronautical Research,
told iata Public Relations Conference in Washington: “Our understanding of aerodynamics has reached the point where it appears certam that in time an efficient supersonic transport can be developed. . . . There is no question as to whether there will be a supersonic transport; the only question is whose. Right now part of my job is to see that the United States is the first to develop a commercially competitive supersonic transport. . . .
“In the hypersonic region, the X-15 has given tremendous focus to our efforts. The X-15 has such capability that it will be used in furthering certain space research programs. Already we are making radiation measurements—piggy-back experiments along with the hypersonic research program. Our results with the X-15 have been so encouraging that I think we must soon look beyond the transport that goes to Mach 2 or 3, and begin laying the groundwork for the generation to follow. . . .”

240 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
November 18-14: More than 500 leaders from business, industry, government, and finance participated in New England Regional Conference on Science, Technology, and Space in Boston, sponsored by mit and nasa. Dr. Howard W. Johnson, Dean of mit School of Industrial Management, told conference that the “impact of space is largely the impact of space research and development on the economy, one of the important features of the last 20 years. . . .” In 1941, he said, r&d spendings amounted to .7 of 1% of gross national product, or $900 million. Today largely because of space r&d, about 3% of gross national product, or $16.5 billion, goes for r&d.
November 14: nasa announced Maj. L. Gordon Cooper, Jr. (usaf), had been selected for 18-orbit Project Mercury flight MA-9. The day-long space flight would be made no earlier than April 1963. Astronaut Cooper, youngest of original seven astronauts, was back-up pilot and technical adviser for Astronaut Walter M. Schirra in flight MA-8. Back-up pilot for MA-9 would be Cdr. Alan B. Shepard, Jr., who made first U.S. manned space flight (suborbital flight, MR-3) on May 5, 1961.
•	In news conference at mit, Dr. James A. Van Allen said the radia-
tion caused by U.S. atmospheric nuclear test in July would be “undetectable” by July 1963. Dr. Van Allen reported signals from injun, telstar, explorers xiv and xv showed the electronic stream had disappeared within a few days of U.S. explosion and that the electrons at 600-mi. altitude were now undetectable. Electrons at 900-mi. altitude were still creating radioastronomy interference, he acknowledged, but this would be gone by next July.
Speaking at New England Regional Conference on Science, Technology, and Space held at mit, Dr. Van Allen reviewed suggestions made by panel of scientists which met last July-August under National Academy of Sciences auspices at Iowa City. Panel reviewed nasa program and recommended that nasa (1) send scientists with astronaut training along with test-pilot astronauts on early lunar and planetary flights; (2) establish an academy within a year to train scientist-astronaut volunteers, located at Houston, Tex.; (3) work harder to develop new instruments needed for lunar exploration; (4) ensure that planet Mars is not contaminated with terrestrial organisms until question of existence of Martian life is resolved; (5) make more use of university facilities; and (6) reduce time lag between concept of a space experiment and its execution. Spokesman in Washington said complete report of the panel would be issued by early January.
•	West Side Association of Commerce (N.Y.C.) presented National
West Side Award to nasa. In accepting the award, nasa Administrator James E. Webb said: “Except in war time, no large national effort has had such a rapid buildup as the space program over the past five years. The end of the buildup is not in sight, but the rate is slowing down and is keyed to the policy . . . that this is a fast paced, driving, prudently managed and efficiently conducted program, but is not a crash program. . . .
“In my view, we are entering a period when our national decisions and the debates which accompany them will not so much relate to whether and when we can achieve pre-eminence in
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	241
space, but the rate at which we should proceed beyond the time when this pre-eminence is achieved—beyond the time when we have begun manned exploration of the moon. . . .
“It is the contribution of all the forces, in industry, government, and the universities, under the leadership which President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson have given the program, that gives us the basis for the pre-eminence we have in most fields in space and the pre-eminence we will shortly have in all.”
November 14: Soviet interplanetary probe mars i was 2,725,337.592 mi. away from earth at 4 AM est, Tass reported.
•	usaf advanced Atlas missile, Atlas F, was successfully test-fired

•	Albert R. Hibbs, chief of jpl Arms Control and Disarmament, told
American Rocket Society convening in Los Angeles: “Most people on both sides don’t feel that space weapons will be too important . . .,” but military neglect of space could be dangerous pending ratification of a treaty.
•	N. E. Halaby, faa Administrator, said in speech to Bond Club of
New York that recommendations on Federal development of supersonic airliner would be submitted to President Kennedy in about two weeks. He emphasized that U.S. was interested in transport of mach 3 capability (2,000 mph or more).
•	Plan for joint British-French development and construction of
supersonic airliner was approved by French Cabinet. Under plan, British and French aviation industries would be subsidized by respective governments and would work together on airplane capable of carrying 90 passengers across the Atlantic at mach 2.2 speed (about 1,450 mph)—more than twice as fast as current jet transports.
•	Lt. Col. Charles N. Barnes (usaf) of aec Reactor Development
Div. told annual meeting of Association of Military Surgeons of the United States that first attempt to orbit nuclear reactor in joint aec-usaf Project Snapshot would be made next year. Snap-lOA would be launched with Atlas-Agena vehicle, the Agena stage to be orbited with the 950-lb. Snap-lOA which would furnish auxiliary electric power for instruments. Intended orbit would be several hundred mi. high. Reactor would be turned off after a year and the accumulated radioactive fission products allowed to decay over period of several hundred years; it would be designed to disintegrate during re-entry into earth’s atmosphere.

Launch of similar experiment would be attempted in Dec. for Commonwealth of Australia Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.
•	nasa Director of Manned Space Flight, D. Brainerd Holmes,
addressed National Industrial Conference Board, Chicago, on economic implications of manned space flight program: “ ... In a significant, though incidental way, the space program is already enriching and will continue to enrich our country. It is causing a rapid advancement of industrial technology and the stimulation of our economy. The billions of dollars required for the space effort are not being spent on the moon; they are being spent in our factories and laboratories—for salaries and for new materials and supplies, which in turn represent income for others.
“Already the space industry is a major industry. It is creating new job opportunities at all levels of skills and abilities. It is improving standards of living.
“New economically beneficial breakthroughs will be made in many fields. A successful space program will require major and rapid advances in the uses of energy and the development of new materials, fabrics, and lubricants—the very forces that are basic to economic growth.
“Space research and development is already producing corollary benefits in the form of new products, new methods, and new industrial processes which can be employed in the manufacture of countless articles for human use. The surface has probably barely been scratched. . . .
“The development of space science and technology will undoubtedly strengthen our whole industrial base and serve as effective insurance against technological obsolescence. ...”
•	nasa Administrator James E. Webb announced three-year grant to
Graduate Research Center of the Southwest, Dallas, Tex., for development of advanced scientific experiments in lunar, planetary, and space exploration. Major operating division of grcsw was Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (scas), which would “provide research organization structured specifically to design new space experiments and to provide the scientific guidelines for engineering them.”

ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1982	243
the award would praise Dr. Teller “for contributions to chemical and nuclear physics, for his leadership in thermonuclear research, and for efforts to strengthen the national security.” Dr. Teller, now a professor at University of California, is most noted for his role in development of thermonuclear bomb.
November 15: usaf announced there would be at least three-month delay in first test-flight of prototype RS-70 (reconnaissance-strike) supersonic aircraft. Delay was attributed to problems in sealing fuel cells.
• Astronomer Dr. E. J. Opik, of Univ. of Maryland, was quoted as saying “the Russians have contributed only five-tenths of one
Eer cent” of the new information on space. “They profess to ave sent huge payloads into space 10 to 100 times larger than any the United States is capable of sending. At the same time, however, 99.5 per cent of all information on space has come from the United States' probes.” Dr. Opik was cited in 1960 by National Academy of Sciences for “outstanding investigation of meteoric bodies.”
• Ambassador Charles Bohlen officiated at the opening of a nasa exhibit at the Palais de la D&ouverte, Paris, France. The exhibit would stay in Paris until January 15, included models of past, current, and future nasa spacecraft; panels explaining the goals and results of the U.S. space program; a working telstar demonstration; and a Spacemobile lecture and demonstration. The exhibit was enthusiastically received by French scientific and government personages attending the inauguration.
• afsc announced it was testing electrocardiogram package in free-fall parachute jumps for possible applications in future manned space flight. Worn inside the astronaut’s pressure suit, the small, 14-oz. package could monitor heartbeat (and other physical reactions): Conditioning unit in package converts heartbeat to FM radio signal which is sent by transmitter in package to amplifier in cockpit, and then to ground receivers, where it is converted to electrocardiogram. Use of package would provide astronaut freedom of movement by eliminating need for connections from pilot to spacecraft. Developed by Hughes Aircraft Co., the package was being considered for use in X-15 program.
• Astronomer Dr. Carl Sagan told American Rocket Society, meeting in Los Angeles, that there was a statistical likelihood that earth had been visited at least once by intelligent beings from other worlds. In interview, he suggested that successful planetary civilizations endure for perhaps a hundred million years and that, as the societies advance, they reach farther from their respective planets into space. He predicted man would begin interstellar travel in about 100 years—in star ships, powered by hydrogen-fusion ramjet engines and built in space.
• Scientists at Hughes Aircraft Co. displayed Surveyor lunar probe at American Rocket Society, the probe containing redesigned payload weighing about 114 lbs. as compared to originally designed payload weighing 220 lbs. Payload of instruments would be placed on the moon in late 1964. Dr. Leo Stoolman, Surveyor project chief for Hughes, said reasons for redesigning Surveyor instrument package were difficulty in Centaur launch vehicle program and decision to include only instruments that would directly assist U.S. manned lunar landing program.
244 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
November 15: Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, Director of nasa Manned Spacecraft Center, told Aircraft Industries Association Quality Control Committee in Houston that designs, procedures, and schedules in manned space flight program had to be flexible in order to absorb continual changes of rapidly advancing technology. Emphasizing importance of equipment malfunctions that occur during systems development or preflight preparations, Dr. Gilruth said: “In manned flight, we cannot afford to regard any of these equipment malfunctions as a ‘random’ failure. We must regard every malfunction and, in fact, every observed peculiarity in the behavior of a system, as an important warning of potential disaster. Only when the cause is thoroughly understood, and a change to eliminate it has been made, can we proceed with the flight program....
“Rapid corrective response to malfunctions throughout system development and preflight preparations is a critically important requirement of our programs if we are to meet schedules with hardware that is fit to fly. . . .”
•	Dept, of Commerce released translation of Soviet report on use of
rockets to prevent hailstorms. Report said thousands of acres of grape crops were protected by anti-hail rockets in 1961 and efforts were expanded this year. Rockets were loaded with cloud-seeding chemicals and fired into suspected clouds, the released chemicals crystallizing cloud droplets to (1) prevent existing hailstones’ growing larger, and (2) cause the crystallized droplets to “fall as harmless snow.”
•	Aviatrix Jerrie Cobb told Women’s Advertising Club of Washing-
ton, D.C.: “We’re bypassing the one scientific space feat we could accomplish now—putting the first woman in orbit. . . .”
November 16: Saturn SA-3 reached 104-mi. altitude in ballistic flight from Cape Canaveral, the fully-fueled S-I stage performing as planned. Upper stages were filled with water simulating weight of live stages. At peak altitude, rocket was detonated by radio command and the ballast water was released into the ionosphere, forming massive cloud of ice particles several mi. in diameter. From the cloud experiment (Project Highwater II) scientists hoped to gain data on atmospheric physics. This was third straight test-flight success of nasa’s Saturn and first flight with maximum fuel onboard. Vehicle generated 1.3 million-lb. thrust on flight of 4 min., 55 sec.
•	nasa Ames Research Center announced construction of four space
research facilities, totaling more than $14 million, had been authorized for FY 1963: biosciences laboratory, guidance facility, radiative heat system for Mass Transfer Facility, and helium tunnel. Bioscience laboratory would be used for studies in genetics, radiobiology, immunology, and environmental physiology, and detection of extraterrestrial life. Guidance facility, consisting of three-man capsule with systems and equipment, combined analog and digital computer, and rotating centrifuge to drive capsule, would be used to obtain data on integrated design of guidance, stabilization, control, and crew support systems in advanced manned spacecraft. Radiative heat system would permit Ames scientists to investigate re-entry heating of spacecraft from lunar or planetary missions. Sections of complete heat shields will be tested at the facility. Mach 50 helium tunnel

Its external configuration, weight, and other characteristics were same as S-IV flight units.
•	Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, Director of nasa Manned Spacecraft Center,
told newsmen: “The first unmanned capsule launch [in Project Gemini] has slipped from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 1963. There is virtually no possibility of a manned flight before 1964 .... [Slippage was] simply because of the time it takes to do this very complicated job.”
•	Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator, said in first
annual Theodore von K arm an Lecture of the American Rocket Society: “The costs of the presently approved [space] program increase next year to about six billion dollars if current time schedules are maintained. It would not be possible to include the development of a [manned] space station now without still larger resources assigned to the space program. I personally believe that the next large manned space flight project [after Project Apollo manned lunar landing] will be this one rather than extensive exploitation of the moon or manned expeditions to the planets. This might change if the early lunar exploration returned surprises in the form of natural resources of use on earth.
“I think it will now be appreciated that the present rather arbitrary subdivisions of our program will coalesce, for the manned space station will be useful for both manned and unmanned scientific exploration and could be the site of observation of weather or of communications relay stations . . . .”
•	Relationship between very low frequency (vlf) hiss and aurora
australis (Southern lights) was confirmed after six months of research by two scientists, it was reported. Ward Helms and John Turtle, working at Byrd Station, Antarctica, believe they have confirmed the theory of Henry Morozumi, Stanford Univ. scientist, when they found peaks of auroral display and vlf hiss were identical in intensity and coincided repeatedly. Helms said he was “not certain that vlf hiss is part of the aurora, per se, but I’m sure that since the aurora and hiss peaks are simultaneous there is reason to think the same particles generating the aurora also generate the hiss.”
•	Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert announced signing
of contract with United Technology Corp. for solid-propulsion rocket motors to be strapped to sides of Titan II rocket in Titan III configuration. He said contract with Martin-Marietta Corp. for airframe assembly and test of the rocket, as well as for structure of transitional upper stage, would be signed soon.

second stage veered off course and had to be destroyed.
•	dod released following statement:
“Lockheed [Aircraft Corp.] stands alone in refusing to follow the course that the other members of the [aerospace] industry considered reasonable. . . . Should a strike take place at Lockheed, Department of Defense programs of critical urgency to the national defense would be affected. It is imperative in the national interest that the Department of Defense make necessary preparations to minimize to the greatest extent possible any loss of production that might follow a work stoppage. Responsible officials of the Department of Defense are therefore considering
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OP 1962	247
whether alternate means of production can be utilized so that work on these vital programs can go forward in the event of a stoppage at Lockheed.”
November 17: Low yield nuclear device was exploded in atmosphere at U.S.S.R. Semipalatinsk testing grounds, 32nd Soviet test announced by aec in current series.

November 19: Dr. Andrie B. Severny, Director of U.S.S.R.’s Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, explained techniques used to photograph mars i on Nov. 3, when the interplanetary probe was
120,000	mi. from earth. Using 102-in. telescope, largest outside the U.S., astronomers fixed its aim at spot mars i was calculated to be; automatic controls shifted telescope’s aim slightly to sweep along the probe’s assumed trajectory. At same time, photographs were made, with each plate exposed twice at 30-sec. intervals. Resulting photographs showed mars i as well as its booster rocket traveling through space. This was believed to be greatest distance from which man-made objects had been photographed.

November 20: Office of Aerospace Research announced scientists at Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (afcrl) would conduct the “most thorough study of atmospheric ozone ever made,” a concentrated one-year series of observations with more than 700 balloons carrying sensitive ozone meters into the upper atmosphere. New 11-station network, from Canal Zone to Greenland, would participate in project. To begin in January 1963, project was expected to yield data on nature of ozone.
•	Dr. Eugene B. Konecci, Director of nasa Biotechnology and Human
Research, told conference of Manufacturing Chemists’ Association that nuclear rocket fuel “. . . may eventually make it an attractive matter to bring lunar ore to the earth for processing. . . .” Nuclear fuel would reduce the cost of each pound of payload.
•	usaf Nuclear Effects Research Laboratory dedicated at Kirtland
afb, N.M. Lab was designed to simulate effects of nuclear explosions on ballistic missile systems; study effects of radiation on people and electronic systems; simulate magnetic and radiation effects of high-altitude nuclear explosions; and conceive radiation experiments for space probes.
•	Dr. Andrei S. Severny, Soviet astronomer who heads the Crimean
Astrophysical Observatory whose 102-in. telescope is the largest outside of California, reported a partial theory on cause of solar flares—solar flare convulsion is brought about by a release of the accumulation of magnetic energy. Based on observations of changes in the strong magnetic fields, Dr. Severny’s interpretation of flares is based on technique developed by Dr. Horace D. Babcock and his son at Mount Wilson in California. Skeptical of Severny’s thesis, a colleague of the Babcocks, Dr. Robert Howard, was reported in Russia to challenge the Soviet data.
•	Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and International Association of Machinists
(iam) union agreed to Federal Mediation Service request that they resume negotiations. The request came after the union had set Nov. 28 as strike deadline.
•	Soviet astronomer Vladimir K. Prokofief reported that he had
discovered traces of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet Venus, based on observations from the spectrum of sunlight reflected from the Venutian cloud cover.
November 21: Temperature within mariner ii Venus probe was reported to be rising. Calculations indicated that when the spacecraft reached Venus its battery temperature would be 129°, 9° more than design limit—creating pressures that could rupture the sealed battery.
•	nasa confirmed Rift nuclear rocket stage would be manufactured in
renovated dirigible hangar at Moffett Field nas, Calif. To be used to flight-test nasa-aec Nerva engine, Rift was being developed under technical direction of nasa Marshall Space Flight Center with Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. as prime contractor. Rift would be flight-tested in 1967-68 as top stage of Advanced Saturn (C-5) launch vehicle.
•	Difficulties in Centaur launch vehicle development were forcing
nasa to program 1964 Mars probe for Atlas-Agena vehicle, New York Times reported. Use of Atlas-Agena would mean smaller payload, with about 60 lbs. of instruments instead of 200 lbs.	_
•	usaf launched unidentified Blue Scout probe from pmr.

November 22: Soviet astronomer Dr. Vasily Grigoryevich Fesenkov reported in interview his conclusion that earth is followed by a comet-like tail, the tip of which stretches as far out as the moon’s orbit. From lifetime of observations of zodiacal light and gegen-schein, Dr. Fesenkov believes solar winds and sunlight pressures form tail from dust cloud enveloping the earth.
Noverr her 23: mariner ii reported by jpl to have again lost power from one of its solar panels on November 15 (similar to inoperative period between October 31 and November 7, after which it suddenly returned to life). Temperatures in mariner ii continued to mount within 20° F of what was foreseen (200° F on sunward face of solar panels, 100° F toward the shady side).
•	Letter from President Kennedy defending Administration policy of
permitting astronauts to sell their personal stories for profit was made public by M. B. Schnapper, editor of Public Affairs Press, in Washington, D.C. Replying to Mr. Schnapper’s criticism of the policy, the President said the “policy decision was reached only after most careful review of all the facts and lengthy consultation both within and without the Government. Efforts were directed toward removing specific controversial aspects of the original astronaut agreement, and we feel that this goal has been reasonably achieved.”
•	In interview, faa Administrator Najeeb Halaby stated that he
would probably recommend the development of a 2,000 mph commercial jet transport, pending results of a full study. Supersonic transport would carry up to 150 passengers between New York and Los Angeles in one hour and 40 minutes. Development costs of perhaps $700 million would, said industry leaders, require Federal subsidy.
•	In press interview in Houston, Astronauts Leroy Gordon Cooper
(Maj., usaf) and Alan B. Shepard, Jr. (Cdr., usn) said television pictures of Maj. Cooper woula be transmitted to ground stations during MA-9 flight by means of miniature transmitter inside the Mercury spacecraft. Pictures could not be viewed live on commercial TV because transmissions would be on different scan speed. Astronaut Cooper also said that a rendezvous maneuver had been considered for MA-9 flight, but decision had been made not to attempt the maneuver. MA-9 is considered to be the last Project Mercury flight, to be followed by Project Gemini.
November 23-December 2: Space Science Fair, held in Cleveland and cosponsored by nasa and Cleveland Plain Dealer, included extensive exhibit covering “virtually all topics of space technology” as well as series of lectures for junior and senior high school students by aerospace scientists and engineers Honorary co-chairmen of the fair were nasa Administrator James E.

November 2/f: dod issued restrictions, it was reported by L.A. Times, on assigning new contracts to strike-threatened Lockheed Aircraft Corp. pending settlement of its labor-management dispute.
•	Soviet astronomer Dr. Iosif Samuilovich Shklovsky, head of radio-
astronomy department at Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow, said in interview with western press that first place to seek signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life is in Andromeda Nebula. The spiral nebula is closest galaxy to our own Milky Way—about 1.5 million light years away. Reasoning that it was likely an advanced civilization should be able to harness enough energy from its sun to create a powerful radio beacon, and pointing out that no such beams had been detected from other parts of our own galaxy, Dr. Shklovsky said such beams could be detected by a single radiotelescope aimed at the entire Andromeda Nebula.
November 25: mariner ii Venus probe established new communications record, transmitting “excellent quality” data from more than 22.5 million mi. in space, (pioneer v probe’s transmission had ceased with position signal from 22.5 million mi. in 1960; pioneer v had ceased transmitting scientific data at 17.7 million mi.) nasa said mariner ii signals were relaying good data on the four scientific experiments on board, mariner ii was expected to pass within about 21,000 mi. of Venus on Dec. 14.
•	Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, aec Chairman, predicted in interview that
in 20 years “we’ll be well advanced in the use of nuclear power in space both for propulsion of rockets and for auxiliary power within orbiting satellites.
“Around the year 1982 we will have already made, or be seriously planning, a manned journey to one of the near planets. And we’ll be using nuclear energy rather routinely in satellites as an auxiliary source of electric power.
“For example, by then, we’ll probably be able to have [world] television broadcasts relayed by satellites brought directly into homes, . . . Within 20 years it might be possible to get reception direct from a satellite wherever a television set was located, even in the darkest part of Africa ....
“I feel that even such predictions as I have outlined may be too conservative in the sense that there may be spectacular developments that we do not even foresee . . . .”
•	U.S. diplomatic source in Geneva disclosed U.S.S.R. had been con-
ducting nuclear tests at the rate of one every two days since Nov. 20, the date previously announced by Soviet Premier Khrushchev as end of current series.
•	Pertinent facts of human evolution should be included in prepara-
tion for interstellar communication, according to Prof. Robert Ascher of Cornell Univ. dept of anthropology and his wife, Marcia, assistant professor in Ithaca College dept, of mathematics and physics. Models of primitive man’s efforts in surmounting barriers can be used as theoretical background for thinking about
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1062	251
!>ossible civilizations on other planets. Problem of watching and istening for signals across space and developing means to reach source of those signals is essentially same as problem of prehistoric man making contact with other races or civilizations. Ascher also declared whenever two civilizations have made contact, conquest by dominant group has followed. Models of those communications should be constructed and studied, Ascher said, and applied to future interstellar communications.
November 25: Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara allotted additional $50 million for development of radar and other components in usaf RS-70 project, dod announcement said restudy of the project had been completed and that recommendations had been submitted to President Kennedy last week.
• U.S.S.R. was building an atom accelerator about twice the size of any in existence, it was reported. The “alternating gradient synchrotron” would be able to accelerate a beam of protons to energies of 50-70 bev (billion electric volts), as compared to 33-bev accelerator at Brookhaven. Atomic research station, with many supporting facilities, was located near Serpukhov.
• U.S.S.R. was building “largest radio telescope in existence” near Serpukhov, it was reported. 20-acre, cross-shaped radiotelescope featured two movable antenna arms of 1-km. length with supporting towers of 65-ft. height, the instrument modeled after cross designed by Dr. Bernard Y. Mills of Australia. Chief character-tic of cross was its ability to collect considerable amount of radio energy emanating from an extremely small area of the heavens. Another instrument at the radioastronomy station was radiotelescope with parabolic antenna 72-ft. in diameter. Station was under direction of Dr. Viktor V. Vitkevich and operated by Lebede Institute of Physics of Soviet Academy of Sciences. November 26: nasa Flight Research Center announced investigation of X-15 No. 2 accident on Nov. 9 had revealed probable cause was succession of equipment failures coupled with landing gear collapse. Inability of rocket engine to attain full power was attributed to faulty governor actuator which prevented engine’s receiving sufficient amount of propellant. Failure in engine’s receiving mechanism did not allow landing flaps to come down and resulted in high load on aircraft’s landing gear. Unusually high landing-load caused collapse of main landing gear soon after the X-15 touched down at Mud Lake, Nev. Pilot John McKay sustained severe bruises, a back injury, and shock; but he had been released from hospital and had returned to work at nasa Flight Research Center. Accident was under continuing investigation by nasa and usaf engineers, with plans calling for mechanical improvement in flap-lowering mechanism before another X-15 flight.
• Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel prize-winning chemist, predicted U.S. would land a man on the moon in 1969.

November 26: Closed-door sessions of the 13 directors of Communications Satellite Corp. were reported in Drew Pearson’s column, discussions on the revolution in communications made by satellites and the international complications involved.
•	J. G. Morse of Martin-Marietta Corp. told Atomic Industrial Forum
in Washington that the Government should begin immediately to develop nuclear power systems for communications satellites. Morse suggested that only nuclear power in form of radioactive chemical or isotopic generators could satisfy communications satellite needs—systems in power range of 60 to 300 watts, with operational lifetimes of more than 10 years.
•	Soviet scientist Nikolai Semyonov, writing in Pravda, noted that
many U.S. corporations had applied-science laboratories and U.S. universities had laboratories devoted to pure science. . . This is profitable for them inasmuch as it is university science which gives them, in the main, those fundamental scientific results which supply the laboratories of corporations, and through them, production.” Mr. Semyonov’s article was in support of Premier Khrushchev’s order that Soviet research institutions be developed on an industry basis.
November 27: Aerobee 150A sounding rocket launched from White Sands Missile Range, N.M., in nasa experiment to gather data on solar radiation intensity in ultraviolet region. Rocket carried spectrophotometer package to 124-mi. altitude. Preliminary experimental results: “High voltage arcing in the instrumentation prohibited collection of scientific data ... .”
•	Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, Assistant Director of Lunar and Planetary
Programs, nasa Office of Space Sciences, was appointed chairman of Joint Working Group of nasa Office of Space Sciences and Office of Manned Space Flight. Group would be responsible for (1) recommending detailed program of scientific exploration in future manned flights; (2) defining information desired from unmanned flights to support manned flights; and (3) establishing and maintaining close liaison with nasa field centers, other Government agencies, and universities in development of integrated scientific program for manned flight. Dr. Shoemaker had been employed by U.S. Geological Survey as Chief of Astrogeology Branch in Menlo Park, Calif.
•	Experimental new method of producing synthesis of chemicals with
low-energy ions was reported by Rocket Power, Inc., a solid-propellant manufacturer. Milton Farber, vice president and director of laboratories, and Dr. Stanley Singer, chief chemist, indicated several new compounds had been produced. Mr. Farber said the ion-synthesis method could produce rocket propellants perhaps 10 per cent more efficient than any now available in U.S. “The key is the speed of the ions. If the beam of ions meets the target chemical at too high a rate, shattering occurs. By controlling the velocity of the ions, they can be made to merge with the chemical, creating a new compound.” Research project was sponsored by usaf oar.
■ Representative Chet Holifield, Chairman of Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, declared in speech that “moon madness” is starving scientific programs other than space exploration. He predicted budgetary troubles for atomic energy programs because of “greater priority” of space programs.
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1062	253
November 27-December 9: Four launchings of Centaur rockets took place from the Argentine Rocket Range, Chamical, as part of worldwide program of simultaneous measurements of winds and turbulence in the ionosphere by means of sodium-cloud experiments. The Argentine launchings were joint cooperative effort of French National Committee on Space Studies and the Argentine National Commission on Space Research.
November 28: Presidential Science Adviser Jerome Wiesner, speaking before American Society of Mechanical Engineers in New York, said special panel to study scientific manpower had concluded that “impending shortages of talented, highly trained scientists and engineers threaten successful fulfillment of vital national commitments.” As first step to overcome shortage, Wiesner urged that 8,000 additional college students enroll in autumn 1963 as full-time graduate students in engineering, mathematics, and physics. Panel set goal of 7,500 Ph. D. graduates by 1970 (3,000 Ph. D. degrees were awarded in 1960).

•	aec announced first U.S. “breeder-reactor” had achieved self-
sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Producing more fuel than it burns, plutonium-fueled reactor was expected to become valuable and economical power source.
•	Dr. Edward Teller, Associate Director of Lawrence Radiation
Laboratory, told American Nuclear Society in Washington that peaceful use of atomic explosives had “the potentiality of becoming the first really important and thoroughly economic use of atomic energy.” Feasibility of such use was demonstrated last summer with 100-kiloton thermonuclear explosion at 635-ft. depth in Nevada, the explosion removing about 7,500,000 cu. yds. of earth and leaving crater 1,200 ft. in diameter and 320 ft. deep. Dr. Teller said radioactivity can be controlled so that excavated area can be entered a few weeks after the explosion with no more exposure than in an atomic laboratory. He predicted nuclear explosions on the moon could be used to extract water from chemical compounds in lunar rock.
•	International Association of Machinists (iam) workers struck at
Lockheed Aircraft Corp. in California, Florida, and Hawaii. President Kennedy, invoking Taft-Hartley Act, created three-man board of inquiry to investigate the dispute; board’s recommendations, due Dec. 3, would contribute to President’s decision whether to request Federal court order barring strike for 80-day period. Included in Lockheed production items are Agena second-stage rocket, used by usaf and in nasa Ranger and Mariner programs.

November 28: Project stabilization agreement—set of standard pay and benefit practices for both union and non-union workers— was adopted at Cape Canaveral, it was reported. Agreement was product of more than a year’s negotiation by contractors and unions working at Cape Canaveral, undertaken at suggestion of President’s Missile Sites Labor Commission.
November^: Dr. EdwardJWelsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, told Atomic Industrial Forum: “We cannot afford to find ourselves with a space gap due to a lack of advanced planning and of attention to advanced developments. Yet, we will assuredly have such a gap if we do not push enthusiastically the potential of nuclear energy and power at an increasing rate in the field of space. . . . It would indeed be foolish not to develop and use the propulsion system which would carry the greatest weights the greatest distances most economically. The potential of nuclear propulsion in such an objective cannot be overestimated. . . .”
•	nasa test pilot John McKay predicted X—15 would soon attain
speeds seven times speed of sound at altitudes up to 500,000 ft. during a new series of flights.
•	afssd broke ground at Edwards afb for construction of world’s
largest and most highly instrumented solid-rocket engine test facility. Stand was primarily to test five-segment 120-in. solid rockets for Titan III, but it also had capacity to test segmented solid rockets’up to’andfincludng 156-in.
November 80: Franco-American scientific sounding rocket launchings coordinated when two U.S. launchings were made from Wallops Island while France launched one from Algeria and failed to launch one from France. First U.S. rocket (Nike-Cajun) fired at 5:57 AM carried a Langmuir probe to determine electron density and the temperature of the “E” layer of the ionosphere (50-100 miles altitude); the second (Nike-Apache) launched at 6:15 AM, released a sodium vapor cloud to 106-mi. altitude which spread over 100 miles of the eastern seaboard. “Sporadic E” regions of the ionosphere have electron density that reflects much higher radio frequencies, and may result from wind shears. On November 7, gsfc scientists undertook the first sounding rocket _ firings to examine correlation between “E” region and wind shears.
•	Sixth and final powered test of Kiwi B-4A ground-test reactor for
Project Rover was successful at Jackass Flats, Nev. Newsmen were permitted to watch this test from a mile away, the first test to which outside observers had been allowed. Kiwi B-4A, looking more like a flyable engine than some of its predecessors, was mounted on a remote-controlled railroad flatcar, consumed tons of liquid hydrogen in the half-power, five-min. test. Part of the joint aec-nasa program for development of a nuclear-powered rocket, the series of ground reactors tested different reactor designs, fuels, metals, and accessories.

November SO: Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein, prof, of astrophysics at Cal Tech, estimated aggregate of energy far out in universe was equal to amount of energy released by 10,000,000 stars like our sun in their entire lifetimes. “No known physical phenomenon can account for it. It must be the result of some fantastic catastrophe in the universe,” Dr. Greenstein said. Electromagnetic energy was detected by radiotelescopes.
•	Representative Charles E. Goodell (R-N.Y.), speaking at House
Education Subcommittee hearing, criticized nasa’s hopes to recruit 1,000 graduate students into space research each year during this decade: “That’sj25 per cent of our production of Ph.D.’s in the space-oriented sciences. That’s an incredible share of our brainpower to concentrate on one agency.” John F. Clark, Associate Director and Chief Scientist, nasa Office of Space Sciences, defended nasa aim as being commensurate with nasa’s share of total Government expenditures for research.
•	Representative John E. Moss (D-Calif.), Chairman of special House
Subcommittee on Government Information, criticized “Government news management which is unique in peacetime.” He objected strongly to handling of news about military space launches: “All launches by military agencies, whether they are for a military purpose or to gather information of a scientific nature, are covered by a blanket of secrecy. . . . All information about the billions of dollars spent by the military in space research is channeled through the Pentagon’s single public information voice.”
Moss recalled last September when nasa said that six Russian attempts to send space probes to Venus and Mars had failed. Since then, Moss said, “there has been a complete blackout of information about Russian satellite efforts. This is the kind of news management that causes grave concern. ... If we cover up Russian successes ... we can certainly cover up our failures. This . . . leads to a dangerous delusion of the American people.”
•	In press interview, former President D. D. Eisenhower recom-
mended reduction in next year’s Federal spending by at least $4 billion, with $2 billion coming out of the $4-billion space budget.
•	At meeting of the National Academy of Sciences at Austin, Texas,
President Frederick Seitz said that other nations should bear a larger share of space exploration efforts. This would help solve “a big problem for us today—whether the attention being given to aero-space in America is draining too much manpower from the other sciences.”
•	Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz said in San Francisco that
Lockheed Aircraft Corp.’s “extraordinary intransigence” was responsible for deadlocked negotiations with the International Association of Machinists which resulted in two-day strike (iam strikers returned to work today). Three-man board of inquiry appointed by the President began their investigation of the “union shop” conflict.
During November: In letter to House Committee on Science and Astronautics, nasa Administrator James E. Webb advised Congress of plans to reprogram $10,426,000 in FY 1963 funds to begin construction of facilities at White Sands Missile Range (wsmr).

•	Harold Berger, Associate Physicist at Argonne National Laboratory,
said recent experiments with neutron beams had demonstrated they not only match penetrating power of x-rays but also reveal structural features which x-rays cannot expose. "It has been known virtually from the time the neutron was discovered 30 years ago that these particles might be used to make pictures through objects opaque to light,” Berger said. “But neutron radiography could not be developed until sources of slow neutron beams became available. Such sources were provided by the development of the nuclear reactor and particle accelerator.

The value of neutrons is that their absorption characteristics are quite different from those of x-rays. . . .
“One of the fascinating things that has emerged concerning neutron radiography is that the same neutron beam used to inspect several inches of uranium or lead can be used to inspect specimens such as leaves, insects, and thinner biological specimens.”

•	Radiation research results reported by George M. Woodwell of
Brookhaven National Laboratory to American Association for the Advancement of Science showed that plants, like animals, vary in sensitivity to radiation. Large plants that reproduce slowly, such as trees, appear more susceptible to radiation than less complex plants, such as algae and fungi. “. . . The hypothesis seems tenable that small organisms with wide ecological amplitudes and high rates of reproduction—in short, weeds and other organisms frequently considered pestiferous because of their persistence under persecution—have survival advantage under conditions of long-term exposure to ionizing radiation over large organisms with longer life cycles.”
•	Development of two-way portable communicator providing con-
fidential conversations up to 10 mi. apart via infrared beams was announced by Raytheon Co. Pencil-thin light beam is so narrow that it is virtually impossible to intercept or tap, Raytheon said.

•	Editorial on tactical fighter (tfx) program, contract for which was
awarded to General Dynamics and Grumman Aircraft by dod, appeared in Aviation Week and Space Technology:
“. . . Underlying the whole tfx concept is one of the solid, basic technical explorations by the researchers of the old National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (naca) that did so much to keep this country the international leader in supersonic aircraft development. Without the fundamental research into the variable sweep wing and the detailed development of this
K‘ iple by the Langley research laboratory group headed by Stack, the current tfx concepts of both final competitors would have been impossible. . . . The full story of the Langley contribution to the tfx program should be hammered home as an example of how these research and development investments eventually pay substantial dividends. . .

•	Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., nasa Associate Administrator, told
Joint Computer Conference in Philadelphia: “. . . It is no exaggeration to say that we could never have succeeded in orbiting and tracking even the simplest satellite without the availability of
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1062	261
computers. . . . And it is certainly true that one of the major pacing elements in our rate of progress toward achieving the national goals in space will be the development of progressively more advanced computers and computer techniques to help cope with the even greater tasks ahead.
. . [Data processing] systems of the future, as we see them, will involve compatible combinations of computer and ancillary devices, some of which will be spaceborne, some stationed on celestial bodies other than the earth, and some of course will still be here on earth.
“Such computer systems will be required to perform navigational and attitude control tasks; edit and store scientific and engineering data; make calculations of a conventional nature; time sequences of operations; feed displays; and trigger alarms.
“A task for the future is to extend . . . [the computer’s pre-launch checkout] function to spacecraft for launching from orbit, for landing on celestial bodies, and for take-off from remote planets for return to earth. . . . What we are looking for are systems which are fully automatic and fast. ...
“It is apparent that in general a rather complete distribution range of computing burden will exist. In some missions, such as close-to-earth satellite, earthbased computing equipment will perform most of the processing required. Other missions, such as one bound for Pluto, will require the autonomous activity of a highly redundant, self-adaptive, self-checking computer complex aboard the spacecraft.
“A vital need, therefore, is determination of the optimum nature, disposition and use of computing equipment. ...
“Eventually ... we may have large numbers of vehicles simultaneously operating in space. ... In such a situation we will need sophisticated and very comprehensive Flight Control Centers, with compatible computer systems aboard the spacecraft, to handle information on flight status, command control, navigation, and program sequences. ...”

Project was outgrowth of International Geophysical Year (igy), 1957-58, considered highly successful both in scientific results and in international cooperation.
•	John Dykstra, president of Ford Motor Co., told American Ord-
nance Association meeting that a great potential defense capability lay untapped in industry—particularly in heavy, mass-producing manufacturing. Asserting that the problem of developing and maintaining broad defense and space capability throughout industry had not been adequately realized or defined, Dykstra suggested reorganizing U.S. productive resources and putting “much more of our heavy manufacturing industry in a state of preparedness to switch readily from peacetime to wartime production. Such preparedness would mean, at a minimum, that heavy industry would be kept current in matters of defense technology in areas of natural interest to it. Such preparedness could also involve a broader distribution of space and defense research and development effort, as well as of production, on a systematic basis. . . .
“Whatever form an Industrial National Guard might take, I believe the concept is essential. In view of the enormous demands now being made on all our resources of brainpower, we cannot afford to make less than the best possible economic and efficient use of them. ...”

December 12: President Kennedy, back in Washington after inspection of defense and nuclear-rocket facilities, said:
“We are going to let these test go on of the [Project Rover] reactor. These tests should be completed by July. If they are successful, then we will put more money into the program, which would involve the Nerva and Rift, both the engine and the regular machine. We will wait until July, however, to see if these tests are successful.
“It should be understood that the nuclear rocket will not come into play until 1970 or ’71. It would be useful for further trips to the moon or trips to Mars. But we have a good many areas competing for our available space dollars, and we have to try to channel it into those programs which will bring us a result, first, on our moon landing, and then to consider Mars.”

December 14: mariner ii passed within 21,600 mi. of planet Venus and made 42-min. instrument-scan of Venutian atmosphere and surface before continuing into perpetual orbit of the sun. In world’s first close interplanetary contact, mariner ii measured and returned temperatures and other characteristics of Venutian surface and its atmosphere; telemetry signals would be analyzed and evaluated by jpl, technical manager of interplanetary programs for nasa. In press conference at nasa Headquarters, jpl Director Dr. William H. Pickering said all instruments onboard mariner ii functioned as planned and the mission was virtually a complete success, nasa Administrator James E. Webb hailed the achievement as “an outstanding first in space for this country and for the Free World.” nasa Director of Space Sciences Dr. Homer E. Newell pointed out that the probe’s internal tempera- . tures ranging from 125° F to 200° F had not prevented the scientific experiments from succeeding; temperatures were expected to continue rising as the spacecraft traveled closer to the sun. jpl would continue tracking the probe as long as possible, even though its scientific mission was considered completed.
Dr. Newell outlined significant interplanetary data already obtained from the four scientific instruments onboard mariner ii. “. . . The plasma probe revealed a steady ‘solar wind’ at 250450 miles per second. The magnetometer showed that space contains fields of at least a few gamma and that there are fluctuations by factors of as much as 5 to 10. . . . The cosmic dust detector indicated that the meteoritic particles in space are less numerous than near Earth by a factor of 10,000. . . .” When mariner ii neared Venus, two additional experiments were activated—microwave and infrared radiometers to measure temperatures and identify their sources (surface or atmosphere).

December 24: Edgar M. Cortright, nasa Deputy Director of Space Sciences, said in press interview that stringent rules on sterilization of spacecraft components constituted one of the greatest problems in Project Ranger, nasa policy to prevent contamination of the moon by terrestrial germs did not require sterilization “to the point of jeopardizing reliability,” Cortright said, but rejection rate on many spacecraft components became much higher as result of the policy; some components would not operate properly after being subjected to sterilization processes (including alcohol, ethylene oxide, ultraviolet rays, and heat). Relaxation of strict sterilization rules for Ranger spacecraft was one of the changes being considered in “re-orientation” of Project Ranger, Cortright indicated.
•	Japanese Meteorological Observatory reported abnormal atmos-
pheric pressures from a Soviet nuclear blast, apparently one of two recorded also by Uppsala University in Sweden. Japanese agency estimated the strength of the blast at 20 megatons. It said the abnormal pressure lasted from 40 to 100 minutes. Two blasts registered at the seismological institute in Sweden were listed at 19 megatons and 8 megatons. The geodetic institution of the Technological High School at Stockholm, Sweden, registered another gravitational disturbance which may have been a third Russian nuclear test, one which had a force of about 10 megatons. During the past 10 days, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission had announced that the Russians have conducted at least four nuclear tests.
December 26: At aaas convention in Philadelphia, Dr. P. J. Coleman, ucla scientist, reported on the findings of mariner ii in the vicinity of the planet Venus.

December 27-29: Second Western Conference of the American Geophysical Union at Stanford, Calif. Sidney M. Serebreny of sri reviewed tiros i photographs on 14 orbits in May 1960, which showed a blocking pattern in east-central Pacific accompanied by an invasion of tropical air aloft into northerly latitudes and rationale for positioning of the jet stream over the northern Pacific. Life history of tropical cyclones was analyzed from Tiros photographs by James C. Sadler of nsf. And Richard D. Tarble of U.S. Weather Bureau indicated that tiros i photographs of ice pack and areal snow cover eould be used to predict river flow and water supply from snow melt. Other space science papers on meteorology and planetary sciences were presented.
December 28: Preliminary results of particle-flux-detectors onboard mariner ii were reported by Dr. L. A. Frank and Dr. H. R. Anderson at American Geophysical Union meeting, Stanford Univ. The instruments showed absence of particles near Venus, indicating the planet’s magnetic field does not extend out as far as trajectory of mariner ii; this observation was confirmed by onboard magnetometer. Cosmic-ray measurements during the probe’s interplanetary flight indicated cosmic-ray flux was a constant measurement throughout the flight (approximately 3.0 particles per sq. centimeter per sec.). High-energy solar particles were generally absent except for a single solar-flare event beginning Oct. 23; low-energy solar-particle counter detected this event and at least eight others. Total radiation dose recorded in Oct. 23 event was only about 0.24 roentgens inside ionization chamber’s 0.01-in.-thick steel wall, and radiation was very non-penetrating.
•	At national conference of American Geophysical Union at Stanford
Univ., scientists John D. Anderson and George Null of jpl reported mariner ii fly-by of Venus produced the most accurate estimate yet of the mass of that planet—0.81485 times the mass of the earth, with probable error of 0.015 per cent. Final analysis might slightly alter value and further reduce error.
•	Preliminary results of solar-wind experiments by mariner ii were
reported by Dr. Conway W. Snyder of jpl at American Geo-
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	279
physical Union meeting. Experiment measured velocity, density, and temperature of solar plasma using electrostatic analyzer onboard the probe. Results showed energies of gas atoms in solar wind are very low as compared to cosmic-ray particles, but number of solar-wind particles is about a billion times greater than number of cosmic rays, making total energy content of solar wind much greater than of cosmic rays. Solar flares eject plasma clouds which may have higher velocity, density, and temperature than undisturbed solar wind—which mariner ii found to be little less than 250 mi. per sec. velocity, 10-20 particles per cu. in. density, and few hundred thousand deg. temperature, mariner ii also found solar wind appears to be “supersonic”—and supersonic effects such as plasma shockwave ahead of the earth and other planets would be objects of study of future nasa space vehicles.
December 28: Scientists again attempted to turn on relay communications equipment, but the satellite’s power level was still too low.
•	Interaction of winds in lower atmosphere and turbulence in upper
atmosphere was reported at aaas meeting by Univ. of Chicago scientist Colin O. Hines. Hines said wave motions (“internal gravity waves”) from earth appear to generate whirlpool turbulences up to 50 mph and sweeping upward as high as 50 mi. As strength of upper atmosphere varies, so too does its chemical composition; changes may react back to lower atmosphere. Hines said turbulence seems to provide heat to upper air at rate of one degree a day—and perhaps as high as 10 degrees a day. He also noted that turbulence ends rather abruptly at altitudes from 60 to 70 mi., the abrupt change altering upper air’s chemical composition: whereas presence of turbulence mixes chemicals in atmosphere, absence of turbulence separates chemicals into distinct layers. Hines concluded further study of turbulence could contribute to better long-distance radio communications which use ionospheric irregularities, partially produced and controlled by the whirlpools.
•	Dr. Sheldon J. Korchin of National Institutes of Health and Dr.
George Ruff of Univ. of Pennsylvania reported at aaas conference that American astronauts are typically Protestants, natives of small towns, members of middle or upper-middle class families, and have average IQ of 135. Summing up results of testing astronauts, two psychiatrists concluded astronauts have normal anxieties but above normal ability to control them. Average astronaut prefers outdoor sports to indoor; is oriented to action rather than thought; prefers facts to speculation; has abiding belief in his own competence and willingness to strive for perfection.
•	Efforts of special Presidential board to settle dispute between
Boeing Co. and International Association of Machinists (iam) were unsuccessful, board chairman Saul Wallen announced, and no further mediation sessions were planned. Dispute centered around iam’s demand for union shop and Boeing’s unwillingness to grant it.
280 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 19 62
December 29: Planet Venus may rotate clockwise on its axis at a rate of about once in 250 earth days, Richard H. Goldstein of nasa Goldstone Tracking Station announced. Conclusions were based on mariner ii “fly-by” of planet Venus Dec. 14 and of radar experiments conducted by Goldstein at nasa Goldstone Oct. 1-Dec. 17.
•	nasa announced 4,000-lb. micrometeorite satellite would be launched
with Saturn test vehicles SA-8 and SA-9. Satellite, to unfold in space exposing surface area of 2,000 sq. ft., would be “bonus” experiment with chief missions of flight to be launch vehicle development test and atmospheric re-entry test of Apollo boilerplate spacecraft.
•	Dr. Freeman H. Quimby, Chief of Exobiology Programs in nasa
Office of Space Sciences, announed U.S. plans to land life-detecting devices on Mars in 1966. “Perhaps Mars is sterile. But we’re working on the postulate there may be some forms of life,” Dr. Quimby told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Philadelphia.
•	Addressing American Association for the Advancement of Science,
Dr. Loren K. Eiseley, anthropology prof, at Univ. of Pennsylvania, said that space defense efforts are “consuming an enormous amount of our wealth and energy. . . . Let a few generations go by, and so much of society’s wealth and employment will be wrapped up in this sort of thing that you will get-—as we are beginning to get now—a vested interest in war. . . . [The space/defense effort is] a kind of gigantic tumor. When these emerge, you not alone run the danger of weakening society, but also encounter the fact that these tumors grow and become monstrous; to reduce them to normal size becomes difficult if not impossible. . . .” Dr. Eiseley predicted the massive emphasis on space and armaments might lead to downfall of modern civilization; he compared the preoccupation with space and armaments to Imperial Rome’s colonialism, Ancient Egypt’s tomb and pyramid building, and India’s elaborate caste system which contributed to downfall of those ancient civilizations.
•	Soviet news agency Novosti reported first Soviet radioastronomy
experiments with planet Venus Nov. 19 and 24. Scientists sent words “peace,” “Lenin,” and “U.S.S.R.” to Venus in radio code and they returned to earth about 4.5 min. later.
December 30: at&t announced that second Telstar communications satellite would be launched next spring, one which would attempt to avoid or overcome radiation damage which shortened the life of telstar i. telstar i transmitted the first live intercontinental television after launch on July 10, but developed malfunctions in power sources on November 29.
•	Speaking at general aaas meeting in Philadelphia, Dr. Hugh L.
Dryden, Deputy nasa Administrator, supported the thesis that science has developed most rapidly in an environment of a national social need, most often for national defense or health. In an atmosphere of highly motivated and widely supported national activities, science and scientists have received enhanced support over broad areas as well as in narrow specialties: Benefits of this have far outweighed unbalances. Such has been our national experience in the technologies of aeronautics, com
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	281
munications, radar, nuclear energy, and now space. In such periods, the number of free scientists supported to work on problems of their own selection is greater than in the absence of social pressures, although admittedly there is a still greater expansion of team effort.
Dr Dryden said: “. . . It is our aim in nasa to administer the [space] program in such a way as to strengthen science and engineering broadly, to strengthen our universities and our industrial base, in fact to add to our national strength in every possible way. As regards the problem under discussion, nasa has undertaken as a goal the support of about 4,000 graduate students per year in 150 qualified universities to do our part in increasing the supply.”
December 30: Dr. Robert M. Petrie, Director of Dominion Astro-physical Observatory in Victoria, B.C., told aaas in Philadelphia that the Milky Way Galaxy appears to be expanding. Dr. Petrie’s 20-year study of 600 “B” stars (hottest and brightest stars in the galaxy) produced evidence that our sun and all other stars are moving away from the galactic center.
•	Dr. James A. Van Allen, State University of Iowa physicist,
criticized Government report on atmospheric radiation resulting from U.S. high-altitude nuclear explosion in July, which stated radiation levels were much higher than had been predicted and would last longer than had been predicted. Dr. Van Allen charged the Government report was a “hasty and ill-considered” interpretation of the facts; he predicted the bulk of artificially formed radiation would no longer be detectable by summer of 1963. Dr. Van Allen said President’s Science Advisory Committee ignored findings from injun satellite (which he used to study effects of the explosion) and relied instead on data from telstar satellite, launched after the nuclear test. Scientist James W. Warwick of University of Colorado, basing his conclusions on radio measurements from ground stations in Hawaii and the Philippines, said his studies were in general agreement with those of Van Allen and his coworkers and were “inconsistent” with Government estimates .based on telstar data. The two scientists were in Philadelphia for session of American Association for the Advancement of Science.
•	Dr. Joseph A. Conner, Jr., of nasa, said in aaas paper that there
will be an arbitrary retirement age for astronauts, not in terms of years but in exposure to penetrating radiation in space.
•	Soviet Cosmonaut Pavel Popovich arrived in Havana to participate
in fourth anniversary celebration of Fidel Castro’s Cuban revolution, Havana Radio announced.
December 31: dod formally canceled Skybolt missile program, announcing that “the Air Force is taking immediate action to terminate all production in connection with the Skybolt program.” Announcement was first public dod notice since President Kennedy’s press conference statement of December 12 on the high cost of Skybolt.
•	Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy,
Rep. Chet Holifield, stated that he saw a narrowing of the Nation’s objectives in space:
97317—63---19
282 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1062
“I cannot help but wonder about the sincerity of our entire space effort in view of the trends which I see in our current program. It appears, increasingly, that our goal is gravitating toward a one-shot manned mission to the moon.
“This effort is centered around the development of chemical rockets whose limitations, compared to nuclear propulsion, are severe.
“. . . The leader in space cannot afford to be so lacking in vision as to fail to appreciate the need for nuclear power. If we are sincere in our effort to be the first on this new frontier, we must maintain a concerted effort to develop nuclear powered machinery for use in space.”
Holifield’s views were made known in a statement accompanying publication of testimony taken during September 1962.
December 81: President Kennedy named Theodore von K&rm&n as the first recipient of the National Medal of Science for leadership in the science and engineering of aeronautics. A native of Hungary, von K&rm&n became a U.S. citizen in 1936 as director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratories of Cal Tech. In 1936 he also initiated the rocket research development which led to the creation of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is presently chairman of the Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development for nato (known as agaed).
•	U.S. Navy announced that the last of its lighter-than-air ships as
well as associated spare parts and equipment was being disposed of. Although the Navy “blimp” program had been terminated in October 1961, a few airships had been maintained on a standby mobilization basis.
•	White House and State Dept, officials denied report by French news-
paper Paris-Presse that U.S. and U.S.S.R. negotiators had signed cooperative agreement to send team of Russians and Americans to the moon in 1970 on first manned lunar flight.
During December: Response to O.E. Forum survey of editors, writers, and publishers: 60% considered present expenditure for U.S. space program fully warranted; 26% probably fully warranted; 8% probably not; 5%, not warranted; and 1%, no response. Asked what should be level of expenditure (relative to gnp) in immediate future, 25% replied sharply higher; 30%, a little higher; 22%, remain at about present ratio; 6%, a little lower; 6%, sharply lower; 11%, no response. 33% said U.S. would probably exceed U.S.S.R. in space achievements by 1970, while 40% said U.S. would approximately equal U.S.S.R. by 1970. 45% said prime objective of U.S. in space was to exceed U.S.S.R. space achievements—but without duplication and inefficiencies of an all-out crash program. 35% said prime objective was to sustain a prudent and orderly program of scientific progress in space achievements, with little regard for who leads in the various aspects of space technology. 16% chose crash program to exceed the Russians in space. As to justification for U.S. space program, 59% said: “Because of its by-products, both actual and potential, our space program is an excellent dollar investment, over and above its value for military security and international prestige.” 29% chose this statement: “Our space program requires a high
ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962	283
dollar expenditure which must be justified—preponderantly if not wholly—m terms of its value for military security and international prestige.”
During December: nasa awarded contract to Ford Motor Co. Aero-nutronic Div. for development of camera system to be hard-landed on the moon. To relay photographs of lunar surface back to earth, camera would be used in future Ranger lunar spacecraft and would replace seismometers carried in bangers iii, iv, and v.
•	Hibernation of space crewmen was proposed for long-term space
travel, by usaf surgeons Capt. T. K. Cockett and Capt. Cecil C. Beehler of sam, Brooks afb, Texas. Under their plan, one astronaut would work while the other would ride in state of suspended animation, with life processes slowed to the minimum. During simulated hibernation the body withstands stresses that would be harmful under normal body conditions, the surgeons said.
•	Subcommittee of House Committee on Science ana Astronautics
issued report on solid-propellant rocket motors for Nova-class vehicles: “If the cancellation of this development program [solids for Nova] is based on the cost factor alone, then the committee feels that nasa should review the events of the past. For it was this approach in the development of our icbm that gave the U.S.S.R. their superbooster and the resultant lead in space exploration which the U.S. is still struggling to overcome. The United States cannot afford a second setback of this magnitude. . . .
“The committee is struck by the large amount of manpower and time that both the dod and nasa nave devoted to coordination in trying to reach an agreement and the extended delay in starting even the most basic development program.” Committee recommended giving nasa the funding responsibility for continuation of solid-propelled motor effort, since there exists no direct military requirement for the large boosters.
•	Modulation from ariel i satellite appeared on the carrier approxi-
mately 10 days out of the 31. Data received indicated the x-ray experiment had failed.
•	Dr. C. Stark Draper, director of mit Instrumentation Laboratory,
named 1962 recipient of Louis W. Hill Space Transportation Award by ias. Dr. Draper was cited “for his leadership in the development of inertial guidance and automatic control equipment and techniques vital to the success of space flights.”
•	Vice Adm. William F. Raborn (usn) wrote in U.S. Naval Institute
Proceedings that ability to control weather might bring about greater changes in warfare than did explosion of first nuclear bomb, adding: “The capability to change the direction of destructive storms and guide them toward enemy concentration may exist in the future arsenal of the Navy tactical commander. . . . We already have taken our first steps toward developing an environmental warfare capability. We are using satellite weather from tiros ii for current tactical operations and more accurate long-range weather predictions. . . . Some experiments in fog dissipation have shown promise, and some exploratory research has been conducted on ways to change the heading of major storms. . .
284 ASTRONAUTICAL AND AERONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1962
Admiral Raborn said usn was planning 10-year study of the atmosphere (“atmos”) which would be coordinated with separate research on oceans.
During December: Soviet Prof. V. Nikiforov, in article entitled "Chemistry in the Cosmos and on the Moon” which appeared in Soviet journal Aviation and Cosmonautics, suggested use of a chemical foam envelope on the moon to protect cosmonauts from great temperature changes, solar radiation, and materials on the lunar surface.
•	Sir Bernard Lovell of Jodrell Bank in an interview with London
Daily Telegraph:	. . Although the Russians may have [space]
superiority purely in the sense of rocketry, the Americans have tremendous superiority over the Russians in their ability to instrument their space vehicles and in the extraction of space information.
“If you made an assessment of the scientific information we have obtained about the earth’s environment from space vehicles, you could find that this was very heavily biased in favour of the Americans. They have mounted more sophisticated experiments in their satellites and space probes and they have made them work much better.”
During 1962: Dr. Louis Smullni of mit’s Lincoln Laboratories succeeded in detecting a laser reflection from the moon, although at too low a signal level and too long a pulse length for quantitative measurements. This was considered a first step in use of laser reflection for scientific research.
•	White Sands Missile Range, N.M., was busiest missile test center,
recording 2,615 “hot” tests.
•	Man’s conquest of space accelerated on a broad front. The U.S.
achieved manned orbital flight three times, provided man with his first close-up of another planet with mariner ii’s fly-by of Venus, brought global communications a step closer with the orbiting of the first active repeater communications satellite telstar i, and saw the X-15 exceed its design speed and altitude (4,104 mph and 58.7 mi.). U.S.S.R. achieved first dual manned space flight in an effort that racked up an impressive total of 112 orbits, and launched a space probe toward Mars.
During the year the U.S. successfully launched a total of 61 satellites, deep-space probes, and probes, the U.S.S.R. 17, accord-according to the U.N. Public Registry. Of the U.S. total, 20 were launched by nasa, 41 by dod.
APPENDIX A
SATELLITES, SPACE PROBES, AND MANNED SPACE FLIGHTS A CHRONICLE FOR 1962
Tbe following tabulation was drafted from open sources by Alfred Rosenthal, Historian of the nasa Goddard Space Flight Center, and finalized from available open materials by Dr. Frank W. Anderson, Jr., Assistant nasa Historian. Sources included the United Nations Public Registry, the Satellite Situation Re-ports issued by the Space Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, public information releases of the Department of Defense, nasa, and other agencies, and the President’s Report to the Congress on U.S. Aeronautics and Space Activities—1962. Russian data are from the U.N. Public Registry, translations of Tass News Agency statements in the Soviet press, and international news services’ reports. The history of space exploration requires the recording of as much of the full story as possible for the events swiftly pass by.
Orbital data are either initial or those reported in the first biweekly Satellite Situation Report after launch. Date of launch is that of local launch site time. After all available sources had been checked, there still remained six gaps in the International Code Name Greek-alphabet listing of orbital bodies: 1962 Alpha-Phi, 1962 Beta-Zeta, 1962 Beta-Theta, 1962 Beta-Iota, 1962 Beta-Nu, and 1962 Beta-Xi. Three of these can be accounted for as known but undesignated Soviet launches; the others remain unknown.
Even though the tempo of space flights continued to increase, valid interpretation of the scientific results of many satellites and probes is as yet limited by the normal “lag-time” required to process and evaluate telemetry and other data.

CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHINGS OCTOBER 1, 1958, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 1962
This chronology of major nasa launchings is intended to provide an accurate and ready historical reference, one compiling and verifying information previously scattered over several sources. It spans nasa’s first four years. It includes launchings of all vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by nasa or under “nasa direction” (e.g., abma served as launching agent for the early Jupiter C and Juno II shots, and afbmd for the Thor-Able shots).
An attempt has been made to classify the performance of both the launch vehicle and the payload and of total results in terms of primary mission. Three categories have been used for vehicle performance and mission results—successful (S), partially successful (P), and unsuccessful (U). A fourth category, unknown (Unk), has been provided for payloads where launch vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to exercise its main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary, since many of the results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they ignore the fact that a great deal was learned from shots which may have been classified as unsuccessful.
A few unique items require separate treatment. Their dates have been kept in sequence, but their history has been relegated to footnotes.
Dates of launchings are referenced to local time at the launch site.
The original table was prepared by Robert Rosholt of the nasa Historical Office, who made a comparative analysis of the several general chronologies prepared by the nasa Historical Office, the first six semiannual reports of nasa, and the Space Activities Summary prepared by the nasa Office of Public Information. Additional information and guidance was received from Headquarters Offices, from Launch Operations Center, and from the very useful comments received on the October 1962 version. For further information on each item, see Appendix A of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1915— I960), Aeronautical and Astronautical Events of 1961, and this volume.
Prepared January 1963 (AFEH).

»Aug 21, 1959. While a Little Joe was being readied for firing (at ws) a malfunction caused tbe Mercury escape rocket to flue. The vehicle was undamaged but the capsule was lost In the ocean.
* Sep 16, 1959. An Army Jupiter ntmi, containing a nasa biological experiment, was destroyed by the Range Safety Officer shortly after launch (from amr).
........... x ............. x ............ Difficult to analyze data from 2 of 7 experiments because of high spin rate. To study artificial radiation belt.
...... x .................. x ............ 1st stage only. Project High water utilized
dummy upper stages.
........... x .................. x — First launch with uprated Delta. Power supply voltage originally too low for communications experiments; voltage built up and early in Jan. 63 transatlantic TV transmissions began.
...... x .................. x ............ Micrometeoroid satellite.
*	Sep 24,1969. An Atlas-Able vehicle, scheduled to launch a Pioneer lunar-orbit pay-load, exploded on the launching pad (at amr) while being static-tested.
*	May 9, 1960. The first production model of the Mercury capsule was tested in a “pad abort" test (at ws). The escape rocket was used rather than a launch vehicle.
6 Nov 21,1960, Upon being fired (from amr), a Mercury-Reds tone (MR-1) rose one inch, stopped firing, and settled back on the launching pad; was fired again on December 19. The Mercury capsule rocket also fired. The capsule was recovered and also reused on December 19.
