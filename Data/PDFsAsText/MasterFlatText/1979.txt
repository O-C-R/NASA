NASA maintains an internal history program for two principal reasons. (1) Sponsorship of research in NASA-related history is one way in which NASA responds to the provision of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 that requires NASA to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof.” (2) Thoughtful study of NASA history can help agency managers accomplish the missions assigned to the agency. Understanding NASA’s past aids in understanding its present situation and illuminates possible future directions. Selection of items for inclusion in the chronology is the responsibility of the History Office employee assigned to assemble them; omission or manner of treatment has no relationship to agency policy.

Preface
Astronautics and Aeronautics for 1979-1984 completes the series of annual chronologies of events in aeronautics, aviation, and space science and exploration prepared by the History Division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration since 1961. The concluding volume of the series, Astronautics and Aeronautics for 1985, was published in 1988.
The present volume was written by Bette R. Janson and Eleanor H. Ritchie under the editorial supervision of the director of the NASA History Division. Items for inclusion in this volume were collected by Eleanor H. Ritchie and Lee D. Saegesser of the NASA History Division.
As with any work of this nature, its extensive scope has made the use of primary sources prohibitive. Thus, entries are based largely on normally reliable secondary sources. All entries are followed by their sources to provide researchers guides for further investigations.

January
January 1: The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) announced that this week it would complete taking over all of its own managerial and operational activities, performed by the U.S. Communications Satellite Corporation (ComSatCorp) since INTELSAT’s founding in 1964. ComSatCorp had been handing back responsibilities gradually since 1973 and would continue to provide technical and laboratory services under contract. Jobs done by ComSatCorp had included procuring spacecraft and launch services, operating and maintaining facilities, carrying out technical studies, and performing research and development. This would be the first time in INTELSAT history that it would incorporate all of its own executive functions, both administrative and technical. (INTELSAT Release
79-1-1)
January 2: Wire services reported that an explosion that damaged a Space Shuttle engine during test firing at Bay St. Louis, Miss., on December 27 might delay the first Shuttle launch, now scheduled for the end of September.
Further tests would await determining the cause of the accident—apparently failure of a valve in a high-pressure pump feeding oxygen to a combustion chamber. The engine had completed 255 seconds of a 52-second test firing when the pump exploded, damaging the engine, and NASA would also need 3 to 4 weeks to repair damage to the test stand. Last September, when NASA announced delay of the first launch, originally scheduled for March,
Associate Administrator John F. Yardley warned of further delays “if unforeseen problems arise or the tests are not entirely successful.” {NY Times, Jan 2/79 [UPI], A-13; W Post, Jan 4/79 [AP], A-2)
January 3: George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) announced that the five “payload specialists” selected last July to operate experiments on the first Spacelab mission in 1981 would begin training January 9 at seven cities in the United States and two in Canada. Selection and training of non-NASA scientists to fly in space was a “famous first” for NASA; the scientists chosen by their colleagues having experiments aboard the Spacelab would be the first noncareer astronauts and would include the first Western Europeans and the first non-U.S. citizens to fly on a U.S. space mission. Three payload specialists were Europeans: Ulf Merbold of West Germany, representing Max-Planck Institute of Stuttgart; Claude Nicollier of Switzerland, representing Europe’s Space Technology Center (ESTEC); and Wubbo Ockels of the Netherlands, representing Groenigen University. U.S. selectees were Michael

Lichtenberg of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Since October 1978, the five had been in Europe learning to operate experiments designed by European scientists. Two of the selectees would actually fly on Spacelab 1, and the other three would operate the experiment equipment on earth.
Spacelab 1 would carry 40 instruments, about equally divided between NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) experiments in terms of weight, volume, and power requirements; fields of investigation would include solar physics, space plasma physics, stratosphere and upper-atmosphere physics, biology, medicine, astronomy, earth observation, materials processing, and technology areas, such as thermodynamics and lubrication. After leaving MSFC, the trainees would visit Redondo Beach (Calif.), the Johnson Space Center (JSC), Philadelphia, Boston, and Montreal (Quebec) and Toronto (Ontario) in Canada; return to JSC in Houston; visit Palo Alto, Calif; and be back at MSFC in Huntsville on March 22. (MSFC Releases 79-1, 79-4)
• MSFC reported that a delegation from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) visiting the United States since November would arrive at MSFC January 5 to investigate peaceful uses of space technology. Following up a visit to the PRC last July by Presidential Science Advisor Dr. Frank Press, the Chinese delegation, accompanied by NASA representatives, had visited several NASA centers and U.S. aerospace industry establishments. Among items of interest to the visitors at MSFC would be the Space Shuttle orbiter Enterprise, currently undergoing tests.
The PRC representatives were to be in the United States until mid-January and had concluded an informal agreement on developing a civilian communications system for the PRC and on buying equipment to receive Earth resources data from Landsat remote-sensing satellites. NASA Administrator Dr. Robert A. Frosch headed the U.S. delegation, and Dr. Jen Xin-min, director of the PRC’s Academy of Space Technology, headed the PRC delegation. (MSFC Release 79-2)
January 7: The New York Times reported that a huge international scientific project supported by 147 nations would begin this week. The $500 million Global Weather Experiment (GWE), part of the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP), would be a joint effort of the World Meteorological Organization and the International Council of Scientific Unions, financed by the meteorological group. It would expand the existing World Weather Watch, now generating more than 40,000 daily observations, by using 10 satellites, 50 research vessels, 110 aircraft, 300 high-altitude constant-level balloons, and 300 instrumented ocean buoys, in addition to other measuring devices.
The widely dispersed instruments and large numbers of scientists would study seasonal weather cycles in Earth’s atmosphere and would gauge the practical limits of present technology for weather forecasting, to compile what would be the most complete record of global weather data ever attempted.
A
JANUARY 1979
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS
Twice daily, about 50 oceanographic research ships from 22 nations would release balloon-borne packages for atmosphere measurements; U.S. researchers would release 150 balloons in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to monitor winds and temperatures at an altitude of 47,000 feet. Satellites would record wind forces and directions by photographing changes in cloud shapes and positions; they and other spacecraft would record atmospheric temperature and humidity as well as ocean rainfall and sea surface temperatures.
The head of the U.S. team, Rex Fleming of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said that the belt of tropical oceans around Earth’s equator was an enormous heat sink absorbing solar energy and creating much of the world’s weather and that observations there were meager. “This will be the first time that an annual record of weather data will have been taken over the whole world,” Fleming said. “The world can’t afford to do this every year, but we hope from all this to design a weather-observance system that the world can afford.” U.S. organizations besides NOAA taking part in the GWE would include the Departments of Commerce (DOC), Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), Interior, State, and Transportation (DOT); the National Center for Atmospheric Research; NASA; the National Science Foundation (NSF); Defense Nuclear Agency; the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard; and many academic institutions. (NY Times, Jan 7/79, 1)
January 10: NASA reported that its first high-energy astronomy observatory, Heao 1, had exhausted its attitude-control gas supply, ending a 17-month mapping of celestial X-ray sources. Launched August 12, 1977, and designed for
a 6-month lifetime, Heao 1 had returned data of such quality that NASA had extended its mission. Its systems and experiments had functioned well throughout, though the primary mission ended in February 1978. Results included raising the number of X-ray sources from the 350 previously known to nearly 1,500; locating a new black-hole possibility near the constellation Scorpius, bringing the total to four; and discovering a universal hot plasma constituting a major part of the mass of the universe, as well as a dust and gas cloud with a mass probably sufficient to “close” the universe (prevent its perpetual expansion). The results had already engendered more than 160 technical papers and scientific presentations, and analysis of the Heao 1 data would require years of work by high-energy astrophysicists; the findings might change fundamental concepts of the universe, the NASA report said. Heao 1 would probably reenter Earth’s atmosphere in late March. (NASA Release
79-4; MSFC Release 79-3).
January 16: NASA declared the launch of Comstar C on June 29, 1978, to be successful. Put into a transfer orbit by an Atlas Centaur at the Eastern Test Range (ETR), the spacecraft on July 1 successfully fired its apogee motor to go into the desired synchronous orbit. The assessment was signed January 12 by Joseph B. Mahon, director of the expendable launch-vehicle program in the Office of Space Transportation Systems, and by John F. Yardley, associate ad-

January 20: At a press conference on NASA’s budget for fiscal year 1980 (FY80), Dr. Robert A. Frosch, NASA administrator, said the 1980 budget year would not “go down in history as my favorite.” The request NASA submitted to Congress was just over $4.7 billion, an increase of about $160 million over the FY79 budget, counting in the latter a $185 million supplemental NASA had asked for. The FY80 request would amount to slightly less than the rate of inflation, Dr. Frosch said; not counting the $185 million supplemental in the FY79 budget, the 1980 request would be “about equal to inflation.” Whereas funding sought for space science and applications was up about 20% and the total amount included support for all ongoing programs, it contained no money for “new flight project starts of any major kind” in space sciences or applications. The budget did contain “some increases in aeronautics, where it is more difficult to identify a major new start in any case.”
“Current best estimate” for the first Space Shuttle flight was November 9, postponed from September 28, and NASA’s schedule had been adjusted accordingly.
Money requested for space science had increased $100 million, about 20% over FY79; this covered major projects and research and development now under way, such as Space Telescope, Galileo (the Jupiter-orbiter probe), the high-energy astronomical observatory, Spacelab, the solar polar mission, infrared astronomy satellite, and solar maximum mission. Applications funding included money for joint multiagency research in crop monitoring and commodity projection by NASA, together with the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Interior and the Agency for International Development (AID). Funds for aeronautics would increase 14% to cover current research and technology and to continue the aircraft energy efficiency program, with research on reduction of noise and pollution.
In manpower, NASA would lose 674 permanent Civil Service positions over FY79 and FY80, part of this the agency’s share of a government-wide 2 % cut in personnel. Frosch summarized the budget as one that “in key program areas continues momentum. . .while it’s tight, we think we can make a good transition to the Shuttle era and we can keep going on the science, the applications, and the aeronautics.. .” (Text; W Star, Jan 22/79, A-10)
January 22: The Washington Post reported that Pluto, known for some 40 years as the outermost planet of the Earth’s solar system, would no longer be furthest from the Sun as of this date, when it would edge inside the orbit of Neptune and remain there until March 1999. Discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory, Pluto had an elliptical orbit that would bring it inside that of Neptune every 248 years (that is, the crossing last happened in 1731, and before that in 1483) and keep it there for about 20 years.

JANUARY 1979
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS
Scientists at the U.S. Naval Observatory said that elliptical orbits of the two planets were so inclined that Pluto and Neptune could never come closer than about 240 million miles to one another. Last year, photographs of Pluto revealed a large satellite visible from only one side of the planet; it was named Charon, for the ferryman on the river Styx in Pluto’s realm of Hades. (Washington Post, Jan 22/79, A-9)
January 25: NASA announced that it had named the first four Space Shuttle orbiters that would operate in space to honor U.S. explorer ships. The first orbiter (102) scheduled for launch later in 1979 was named for the Columbia, which located the Columbia River in 1792; Captain Robert Gray named the river for his sloop. Challenger (orbiter 099) was named for the ship that gathered data December 1872-May 1876, filling 50 volumes on Earth’s oceans. Discovery (orbiter 103) was the ship looking in 1610-1611 for a northwest passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean by exploring Hudson’s Bay. Atlantis (orbiter 104) was the first U.S.-operated vessel designed for ocean research, a two-masted ketch that logged half a million miles between 1930 and 1966. Enterprise, the first orbiter built, was named for a vessel exploring the Arctic from 1851 to 1854, as well as for the flagship in television’s Star Trek; as the test orbiter, it was not intended for use in space. (NASA Release 79-10; Washington Post, Jan 26/79, C-2; WSJ, Jan 26/79, 1).
•	NASA reported that engineers at MSFC and controllers at JSC, who had been trying to maintain the orbiting Skylab space station in an attitude of least
atmospheric drag to keep it in space until the Shuttle could try to reboost or deorbit, had turned their efforts toward preserving some control over the spacecraft’s final reentry, since NASA had decided in December to abandon rescue attempts. The controllers had put the Skylab into a solar-inertial attitude, pointing its solar panels at the Sun at all times to ensure full electric power, offering the possibility of some influence over the craft during reentry. Engineers had not agreed on the feasibility of such control but did agree that steps should be taken to preserve the option while studies continued. (NASA Release 79-12; MSFC Release 79-12)
•	Dr. Frank Press, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, told the Senate subcommittee on science, technology, and space that President Carter’s May directive reaffirmed the policy of five previous administrations: separation of military and “open” civilian space programs; data sharing, hardware sharing, and technology transfer between civilian and military programs; and domestic civilian remote sensing regulated by the government.
The United States had spent $100 billion over the past 20 years on federal space activities: about $67 billion for civilian programs ($25 billion for Apollo alone) and $33 billion in military programs. Today, the expenditure was about half and half. The FY79 budget request had been $7.1 billion, and the FY80 request would be $7.9 billion (up by 12%). These sums did not in-

January 30: NASA launched for the U.S. Air Force a satellite called SCATHA (spacecraft charging at high altitudes) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 4:42 p.m. EST on Delta into a transfer orbit pending its boost into operational orbit February 2. Later orbit elements were 43,297-kilometer apogee, 27,512-kilometer perigee, 1,416.6-minute period, 6.5° inclination. SCATHA carried twelve experiments, three provided by NASA, to collect data on high-energy solar-wind particles causing false signals from satellites by building up electrical charges on their surfaces. Military and commercial satellites in geostationary orbit over the Earth at 35,900 kilometers (22,300 miles) had been the major sufferers; the charges could effectively disable vital communications by causing equipment failure, false recording of unachieved events, or initiation of unplanned events.
SCATHA would meet the greatest challenge of its planned 1-year lifetime during a solar eclipse period beginning in March, when electrical charging would reach its height; Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) had included an electric-field detector, a pair of 50-meter antennas to be extended in opposite directions in March to form a single instrument longer than a football field. Extension of the antennas might effect the spacecraft’s dynamics. The USAF’s Space and Missile System Organization (SAMSO) would reimburse NASA about $9 million for the launch. (NASA Release 79-3; NASA MOR M-492-303-79-01 [prelaunch] Jan 17/79, [postlaunch] Oct 25/789; O Sen Star, Jan 31/79, 1; Today, Jan 20/79, 8A; Jan 22/79, 6A; Jan 30/79, 10A; W Star, Jan 23/79, A-6)
During January: The ESA announced that it planned to launch one of its Intelsat V communications satellites on Europe’s Ariane booster. The first four of this series of seven would be launched from mid-1979 to late 1980 on U.S. Atlas Centaurs; ESA’s board opted for a 1981 Ariane launch of its sixth Intelsat V and for Shuttle launches for the other two. (ESA Release Jan 1979, 1)

February
February 1: Flight controllers at JSC reported that they would halt their 24-hour Sky lab watch February 2, following NASA’s decision to abandon attempts to boost or deorbit the space station. The January 25 maneuver that positioned Skylab’s solar panels for constant sun tracking had removed it from the minimum-drag position and would result in speeding up its orbital decay. The repositioning was intended to increase power available to controllers to alter the path of Skylab’s descent, now expected between June and August. (JSC Release 79-03)
February 5: NASA announced that it had signed a contract with Rockwell International Corporation’s space systems group to build two Space Shuttle or-biters (OV-103 and OV-104), convert a ground-test orbiter (OV-99), and modify the first orbiter (OV-102); this would give NASA four orbiters for Shuttle operations. JSC would administer the $1.9-billion contract at Rockwell’s California facilities and at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. (NASA Release 79-15; JSC Release 79-07)
February 6: The Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) reported Japan’s successful launch of an experimental communications satellite Ecs, also called Ayame, from Tanegashima Space Center on an N-l rocket at 5:46 p.m. local time. Early orbit elements were 34,411-kilometer apogee, 193-kilometer perigee, 604-minute period, and 24.1° inclination. Designed for communications tests at very high frequencies, Ayame would later be maneuvered into stationary orbit, the National Space Development Agency said. (FBIS, Tokyo Kyodo in English, Feb 6/79)
February 9: NASA reported that, in keeping with President Carter’s directive on space policy, it would undertake a study with NOAA to determine how far private industry could participate directly in U.S. civilian remote-sensing programs. Under the direction of Arnold Frutkin, NASA associate administrator for external relations, and Wilbur H. Eskite, Jr., NOAA special assistant for studies and analysis, the agencies would ask for private-sector views on capital investment, system ownership, system concepts, development of commercial products, market assessments, incentives needed to participate, and the roles of government and private industry in remote sensing. (NASA Release 79-16)
February 17: The Washington Post reported that NASA’s failure to tell a contractor about classified information on the USSR’s early-warning radar network had cost the federal government $75 million, the cost of rebuilding the

Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) to maintain communications with crews on the Shuttle in its first 10 years; of operations. NASA had had to renegotiate a $786 million contract awarded 3 years ago to Western Union, which designed the TDRSS without knowing about the problem of interference from USSR installations located between the Baltic and the Black Seas and using frequencies high enough to overpower transmissions between the TDRSS and the Shuttle orbiter. An unidentified source told the newspaper that U.S. intelligence had given such a “superclassified” designation to data on Soviet radar frequencies and power outputs that NASA could not give the information to Western Union and its subcontractor TRW Systems, Inc. Renegotiation and rework had delayed the satellite system by at least a year, NASA told Congress, but would not impair Shuttle operations already delayed by engine development problems. ( W Post, Feb 17/79, A-9)
February 18: Wallops Flight Center (WFC) launched SAGE (stratospheric aerosol and gas experiment) at 11:18 a.m. EST on a Scout into an orbit with 655.1-kilometer apogee, 554.6 kilometer perigee, 96.9-minute period, and 54.9° inclination. The 32-pound spacecraft would obtain data on aerosols and ozone in the stratosphere, to be used in studying climate and environmental changes that might adversely affect life at the surface. Data from SAGE would be checked with surface measurements from teams in the United States, Japan, and Europe. SAGE would obtain readings from tropical to high latitudes; similar data for the polar regions would come from an aerosol measurement experiment on Nimbus 7. (WFC Release 79-4)
February 20: NASA reported that four organizations in the United States and Canada had formed a joint sounding-rocket program to study this month’s total solar eclipse and its effect on Earth’s atmosphere and ionosphere. The February 26 event, visible in totality only in the northwestern United States and central Canada, would be the last one in this century observable from the North American continent. Working from two launch sites in western Ontario north of Minneapolis, Minn., NASA, the Army’s Atmospheric Sciences Laboratory, the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, and Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) would gather data or predicting atmospheric responses to such disturbances.
NASA, through WFC, would be the U.S. lead agency for seven rocket launches during the operation. The NRC in Canada would provide construction, ground and flight safety, launch coordination, and other support. The Army lab would sponsor an experiment measuring electron densities, and the U.S. Air Force lab would operate a mobile observatory to measure infrared radiation from the upper atmosphere. (NASA Release 79-18)
February 25: The Soviet Union launched Soyuz 32 from the Baykonur site at 2:54 p.m. local time, carrying a two-man crew to occupy the orbiting Salyut 6 space station for the first time since November 1978, when the Soyuz 29

astronauts returned after a record 139 days in space. Soyuz 32 was manned by Lt. Col. Vladimir Lyakhov, 37, acting as commander on his first flight, and civilian flight engineer Valery Ryumin, 39, who was aboard Soyuz 25 when it failed to dock with Salyut 6 in October 1977 and had to return to Earth 2 days later.
Gen. Vladimir Shatalov, head of the USSR’s space training program, said Salyut 6 had been “an effective platform for work in space,” having been occupied for 8 of the 16 months since its launch in September 1977. It had seen five successful manned dockings (three by international crews including cosmonauts from Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Poland as part of the Intercosmos program), as well as dockings by a number of unmanned supply vessels delivering food and fuel. (NY Times, Feb 26/79, A-14; W Post, Feb 26/79)
During February: The National Aeronautic Association (NAA) reported that the Federation Aeronautique International (FAI) had admitted the People’s Republic of China as an active member effective January 1. (NAA News, Jan-Feb 79)
• MSFC reported completion of a number of Shuttle tests precedent to qualifying the engine and combined elements of the configuration for flight later in 1979. Thiokol Corporation, prime contractor to MSFC for Shuttle motor development, completed static firing tests of the solid-fuel rocket motor February 17 at its Wasatch Division in Utah. During the two-minute firing, the motor thrust reached about 3 million pounds, and the system gimbaling the nozzle for guidance underwent the most severe duty cycle expected to occur during flight. This motor, more than 35 meters long and 3.5 meters in diameter, was the largest of its type ever developed for space flight and the first built for use on a manned craft.
Qualification tests later this spring would check out production, assembly, and firing cycle to support a full flight schedule. Each launch would use two of the motors, separated at burnout and parachuted into the ocean for recovery and reuse. On February 23, MSFC also concluded ground vibration tests of the complete Shuttle configuration, assembled for the first time to provide data on liftoff and flight conditions. (MSFC Releases 79-18, 79-19, 79-21)

March
March 1: NASA reported that arrangements for press coverage of the overland trek of Space Shuttle orbiter Columbia from Rockwell’s plant at Palmdale,
Calif., to Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) and the flight from there to KSC, would begin March 7 for DFRC and March 5-9 at KSC. The trip by truck would precede the mating of Columbia to its Boeing 747 carrier, the brief flight test March 9 of ferry preparations and tile status, and the departure soon after for KSC. The Shuttle would be off-loaded and moved into the orbiter processing facility March 10-11. (NASA Release NE79-2)
• NASA announced preparations for Voyager 7’s encounter with the planet Jupiter about March 5. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) would provide television coverage of the event; employees at Langley Research Center (LaRC) would have a special 7 a.m. colloquium in the center’s cafeteria, complete with breakfast service and television monitors throughout the area. After 18 months of space travel, the encounter would take place at 7:42 a.m. EST at a distance of 278,000 kilometers (172,750 miles) from the planet’s cloud tops. Real-time images and live programming through Comsat 1 would continue for about two hours. (NASA Release 79-26; LaRC anno, undated)
March 2: At “encounter minus 4 days,” JPL issued a Voyager bulletin showing a nine-photo mosaic of Jupiter’s surface constructed from time-lapse photographs taken 7.8 million kilometers (4.7 million miles) from the planet.
The bulletin also gave data on expected Sun and Earth occultations by Jupiter offering opportunities for “unique radio science and ultraviolet measurements” and on the close approaches to the five large Jovian satellites that would also occur March 5. (Mission status report 37)
March 5-6: Voyager 1 successfully met its objectives at the encounter with Jupiter, NASA reported, “streaking” past the planet, “threading its way among the five astounding satellites, and discovering that Jupiter, like Saturn and Uranus, is a ringed planet.” The spacecraft had performed as predicted upon close approach, disappearing behind Jupiter for two hours, penetrating its flux tube, and passing close to both Ganymede and Callisto. It had been subject to hazards from Jupiter’s enormous magnetosphere and high radiation; reception of emergency information and issuance of corrective orders would require more than an hours travel time to Earth and back. However, results were “beyond its creators’ wildest dreams,” especially the imagery of volcanic eruptions and other details on Jupiter’s moons. NASA Administrator Robert Frosch and Deputy Administrator Alan Lovelace said “superlatives fail us.”

The Voyager project manager, JPL’s Robert Parks, called it “spectacularly successful.” (NASA MOR S-802-77-01/02; mission status reports 38, 39)
March 6: NASA announced that it had assigned MSFC responsibility for developing a solar electric propulsion stage to be used first in a planned flyby of Halley’s comet upon its return in 1985, and after that for a rendezvous with comet Tempel II. MSFC had been studying for several years the concept of a system using solar energy to provide electrical power for ion engines. Other uses for such a system would be high-energy planetary and Earth-orbiting missions. (NASA Release 79-31; MSFC Release 79-24)
March 7: NASA announced that Dr. Noel W. Hinners, associate administrator for space science, had accepted appointment as director of the National Air and Space Museum, effective in April.

March 8-12: Columbia, the first reusable Space Shuttle orbiter, started on its way to space Thursday, March 8, with a nine-hour tow by truck from the Rockwell International hanger at Palmdale, Calif., where it was assembled, to the DFRC at Edwards Air Force Base, 38 miles away, where it would be mounted on a Boeing 747 for a brief test of the orbiter plane assembly before flying to KSC. In Lancaster, Calif., the orbiter’s 78-foot wings hung over the sides of the two-lane road into town, barely clearing utility poles, and some street lights had to be moved to clear the way. Spectators lined the route to see the five-story-high 122-foot-long orbiter pass by on its 90-wheel trailer, dwarfing its train of security vehicles, trucks, and a fire engine. Onlookers commented on the heavy security arrangements, but NASA officials said that they had to protect the craft from bystanders who might touch the fragile thermal-protection tiles on the spacecraft surface. Obviously missing were a number of black tiles on Columbia’s belly and white tiles on its sides, to be added in Florida along with the engines and computers.
The scheduled takeoff for Florida might be delayed because of bad weather, NASA spokesmen warned, to lessen chances of an accident during the crosscountry flight; adverse conditions had developed along the route.
The 15-minute test flight Friday of the orbiter-747 combination resulted in extensive damage to the protective-tile surface of the orbiter, said former astronaut Deke Slayton, NASA’s manager for orbiter flight tests. As the 747 took off down the runway at Edwards, parts of the dummy tiles, some as long as 2.5 feet began to fall off the spaceship. When the flight ended, Columbia had lost not only some of the plastic-foam dummy tiles attached by tape to the areas around the windows, fuselage sides, wings, and midtail, but also some of the 26,000 actual protective tiles bonded to the spaceship at the plant. “When the dummies began to fall off, the tape which was attached to them

started to swirl around and damage some of the real tiles,” said Slayton, who flew one of two chase planes to keep an eye on the orbiter-747 test flight.
NASA had decided to send Columbia to KSC without about 8,000 tiles that could be installed there; dummies had been used to cover areas where in-flight problems might arise, but after seeing the test results, engineers decided that not all the dummies were needed. Slayton said that the orbiter-747 assembly was now scheduled to depart for Florida on Monday, March 12. The
3,000-mile ferry flight had originally been set for Friday, March 9, but a problem arose in mounting the orbiter on the 747, caused by misalignment of the orbiter to the three struts atop the 747, and the test flight was delayed until Friday afternoon, after which the tile problem occurred.
Although NASA engineers said March 10 that the combination could still fly cross-country March 12, a later report said that 34 dummy tiles were lost and 39 damaged; 7 real tiles were destroyed or lost and 100 damaged. Replacement of missing tiles would delay the trip at least to Saturday, March 17; NASA planned to complete the fix without removing the orbiter from its carrier aircraft.

March 15: ESA announced approval of a remote-sensing study to be carried out by member states, including Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, with other member states expected to join later. Starting with defining optical and microwave instruments for monitoring land and ocean surfaces, to be used by European remote-sensing satellites planned for launch in the mid-eighties, ESA would stress developments now under way in the respective nations, such as a multimission platform being produced by Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) for the SPOT satellite and a synthetic-aperture radar proposed by West Germany for Spacelab flights in 1983.

March 16: The DOD launched two spacecraft from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Titan 3D, with no word on mission or orbital elements. A later report in Aviation Week & Space Technology'said that the 10:30 a.m. local time launch put a Lockheed-built high-resolution film-return satellite in an orbit with 244-kilometer apogee, 177-kilometer perigee, and 96.4° inclination, to supplement a KH-11 high-resolution recon vehicle that had been operating in space since June 1978, furnishing data by digital transmission rather than film returned to Earth in reentry capsules. The digital system allowed much longer life for this type of spacecraft, whose usefulness did not depend on depletion of its film pod. “As is often the case with film-return spacecraft,” said Aviation Week & Space Technology, the March 16 launch had included a piggyback payload, probably a ferret mission, put in orbit with 625-kilometer apogee, 623-kilometer perigee, and 95.7° inclination.

March 19-23: JSC was host to the 10th annual lunar and planetary science conference or more than 700 scientists from the United States, western Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Soviet Union. The conference had evolved to include reports not only on lunar studies but also on planetary studies and astrophysics. The five-day schedule included a presentation on Pioneer-Venus and on Voyager 7’s Jupiter encounter, plus a three-dimensional film on Mars produced during the extended Viking mission.

March 20: MSFC reported that the NASA barge Poseidon carrying a Space Shuttle external tank and other components had begun an 11-day trip to KSC by way of the Tennessee River and the Gulf of Mexico. KSC would use the items to check out assembly and movement of the components in the vehicle assembly building and to train personnel in stacking the Shuttle on its mobile launch platform. MSFC said the waterways to the Gulf, swollen by recent rains, had receded enough to permit a normal trip to KSC. (MSFC Release

March 23: MSFC announced that payload specialists selected for Spacelab 2 would begin training in April with an orientation tou r to visit most of the principal investigators whose experiments would ride on the 1982 mission. Each of the selectees had been a co-investigator on one of the Spacelab 2 experiments. The three men and one woman selected would visit six sites in the United States and three in the United Kingdom for a first look at many of the experiments and to allow them to decide with MSFC management how much training they would need before the flight. To be visited were Chicago, Iowa City, Palo Alto, Pasadena, Washington, D.C., and Cambridge, Mass., in the United States; and Abingdon, Dorking, and Birmingham in England. Those selected were Dr. Loren W. Acton, research scientist at Lockheed’s Palo Alto laboratory; Dr. John-David F. Bartoe and Dr. Dianne K. Prinz, research physicists at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.; and Dr. George W. Simon, chief of the solar research branch at the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, assigned to the Sacramento Peak observatory in New Mexico. Two of the specialists would actually fly on Spacelab 2 to operate the scientific experiments; the others would operate ground-based equipment and assist the two in orbit. Spacelab 2’s payload would consist mainly of experiments in astronomy, high-energy astrophysics, and solar physics, plus plasma physics, botany, medicine, and space technology. (MSFC Release

March 30: NASA announced that Dr. Robert A. Frosch, NASA administrator, and Roy Gibson, director general of ESA, on March 29 signed a memorandum of understanding in Washington, D.C., on a joint international solar-polar mission to be launched in 1983. NASA and ESA would each provide a spacecraft, and ESA would supply software and personnel to support ESA’s flight operations in the United States. NASA would be responsible for mission control, launch operations, and tracking and data acquisition, and for several experiments. JPL would manage the NASA scientific effort and development of a NASA spacecraft; JSC would manage the Shuttle launch portion of the mission; ESTEC would manage the European effort.
The objectives of the mission would be to study the structure and emissions of the Sun as a function of latitude from the solar equator to the solar poles and to study the interplanetary medium Earth-to-Jupiter and the Jovian magnetosphere. Launched from a Shuttle, the two craft, each propelled by an upper-stage booster, would take a path in the ecliptic plane (that containing all the planets in Earth’s system) toward Jupiter, using its gravity to propel them out of the ecliptic toward the Sun on trajectories to pass one over the north and one over the south solar poles, retrace the ecliptic track, pass over the opposite poles, and fly back toward Jupiter. Mission lifetime would be about five years. (NASA Release 79-37; ESA anno Mar 30/79)
During March: FBIS carried regular reports on the progress of the Soyuz 32 cosmonauts aboard the Salyut 6 orbiting space station. Upon arrival February 26, the crew had begun reactivating the thermal regulators, water regeneration system, and ventilation. On March 1, they had begun checkout of individual consoles and scientific instruments, tested the manual attitude control system, and corrected the flight path of Salyut 6 using Soyuz 32 propulsion.
The following day the crew did baseline medical checkups using Polynom apparatus; the flight engineer was tested in the morning, and the commander was tested in the afternoon. In an interview March 4, the crew’s doctor reported that Lyakhov had needed 1.5 days to adapt to weightlessness but was now feeling well. The crew had asked to begin their exercise program on trainer machines and cycles several days ahead of schedule. Lyakhov’s regime emphasized his “vestibular system”; Ryumin’s, the cardiovascular. On March 5, Tass, the Soviet news agency, said that the doctors were keeping close watch on Commander Lyakhov, “a thick-set man...on his first flight in outer space.” The commentator said “unhasty adaptation” was important during the first few days on the space station, which imposed three peak loads at one time: adaptation to weightlessness, complicated docking and transfer procedures, and emotional strain. More time had been allowed on this flight than usual for the crew to check all the station systems, both those governing flight and those controlling living conditions (the “boost week,” a term used by

cosmonaut Vladimir Kovalenok, one of the communications team keeping in touch with the Soyuz 32 crew).
A March 6 broadcast interview with a “scientific employee at the Flight Center” on repair and servicing of the Salyut said that the intensive activity “did not mean that anything is broken or needs mending.” On Salyut 6, unlike its predecessors, individual items of equipment for the first time could be exchanged when their resources were exhausted. The station had been in orbit for 18 months and carried almost 1,000 different instruments, the reporter said. Important systems, such as life support, had been designed to be practically failure proof by using interchangeable units within easy reach, facilitating periodic exchange of equipment. Introduction of the Progress automated cargo ships meant that new instruments, equipment, and tools were available upon crew request. Progress 2 had brought the Soyuz 29 crew a globe indicator for the control panel to show the station’s location in relation to Earth; it had also brought new computer units for the Delta automated navigation system.
The first job in reactivating the Salyut 6 station had been to check out the docking unit on the transfer module, with its opening into outer space; the Soyuz 26 crew had done this last year. Lyakhov and Ryumin would have to test each on-board system and plug in reserve circuits or replace units. The reporter pointed out that, notwithstanding the long use of the station, “not one reserve circuit in any system has so far been switched on.” The current crew would replace ventilators in the thermal system, light bulbs, cables in the television and communications systems, components of the exercise equipment, and filters and regenerators in the life-support systems.
On March 12, Progress 5 was launched with a load of fuel for the Salyut 6 propulsion unit and materials for its on-board systems. A commentator said that portable cables and other mobile elements of radiocommunication “wear out heavily” on long flights; the crew had replaced headsets, cables, and switches. They had also set up and operated an on-board videotape recorder and a video monitoring device. An interview March 13 with cosmonaut Vladimir Aksenov said that the Salyut represented a new stage of technology, not only because it could be supplied but also because it could be overhauled in space with components and assemblies flown there by freight and crew transport vessels. Aksenov noted that the crew had used an ordinary soldering iron, said to be an enormous departure for repairs in a closed weightless space. Also, he said, basic scientific apparatus had heretofore been assembled in a ground workshop and checked out in a ground station; for the first time, the installation and test of new apparatus would take place on an operating space station in orbit. This was made possible by a wide selection of tools designed especially for use in space: pliers, screwdrivers, clamps, and special instruments to handle special nuts and bolts.
Upon the arrival March 14 of the Progress 5, bringing fuel, equipment, experiment materials, and mail, the crew’s doctor said in an interview that previous flights had indicated that weightlessness had some tricky aspects and
18

that the consequences of exposure to it could be very serious. The current crew were apparently beginning to feel at home in the new surroundings, however. After unloading the ferry, the crew had the job of dismantling the Kristall electric furnace used for more than 40 experiments in space processing of materials and installing new apparatus better designed to operate in weightlessness; they had also plugged in a new chemical battery to reinvigorate the power system. By March 21, the unloading of the supply ship was completed, and the crew was ahead of schedule using the new equipment, especially a color television camera to show the interior of the station with equipment replacements including new sensors installed in the work area to detect minimal air pollution in the station’s atmosphere. On March 24, the crew communicated by television with the flight control center “in the direction from earth to the spaceship.. .for the first time in the history of space flight.” The control center could now transmit drawings, plans, and working documents from the ground to the Salyut; “in principle,” said the report, “any central TV transmission can be sent to the spaceship.” By month’s end, Tass said that the crew had adapted to weightlessness and were proceeding with scheduled tasks.

April 2: NASA reported that 35 candidates for Space Shuttle astronaut had completed classroom instruction and moved into engineering assignments at JSC. The courses had begun in July 1978, and the successful candidates would become astronauts in July 1980. NASA had brought in personnel from other NASA centers and from universities to conduct courses on subjects such as space physics, ascent and reentry aerodynamics, spaceflight physiology, and tracking techniques; veteran astronauts had lectured on the budget process, people, and requirements in the space program and on being a CAPCOM (capsule communicator). Videotapes of the classes would be available to all employees at JSC.
The first crews selected for Shuttle flights had begun lessons in the mission simulator, and the astronaut candidates would be observers. Lessons would include tests of every sort of emergency the crews might encounter during a mission, supervised by instructors who had spent six months learning how to harass the astronauts in their simulator exercises. The lesson plan, scheduled to take nine months “not counting. . .problems,” would prepare the crews for nearly any emergency, NASA said. (NASA Release 79-34; JSC Release 79-20)
April 3: The NAA announced that Sam B. Williams, president of Williams Research Corporation of Walled Lake, Mich., would receive the Collier Trophy, the oldest U.S. aviation award. Williams had designed and developed the world’s smallest high-efficiency fanjet engine, a low-cost lightweight means to realization of the cruise missile. The Williams engine measured 12 x 37 inches, weighed 145 pounds, and produced more than 600 pounds of thrust; it had qualified for both Air Force and Navy cruise missiles. The NAA had presented the trophy annually since 1911 for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in the United States, demonstrated by actual use in the preceding year. (NAA Release Apr 3/79)
April 4: NASA reported that improved components and techniques could lower the “now prohibitive” cost of using turbine rather than piston engines in small general aviation aircraft. If turbines cost only half again instead of three times as much as piston engines, small plane users could reap the advantages of one-third the weight, proven reliability and safety, multifuel capability, and less maintenance, vibration, noise, or pollution.
A study by Lewis Research Center (LeRC) said that an advance turbine aircraft would be 25% cheaper to operate, would use 10% less fuel, and would cost 15% less to purchase than an equivalent aircraft powered by a typical reciprocating engine. Although only 8% of general aviation aircraft flying in the United States, were turbine powered, the study said that the market for

• INTELSAT reported that two new regional satellite systems proposed by member groups would be technically compatible with its present system and would not threaten its economic well-being. A proposed European Communications Satellite (ECS) system would provide telecommunications service to countries in Eastern and Western Europe and North Africa beginning in 1982, working with Europe’s terrestrial network. A PalapaB system, a joint venture of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, would serve remote areas not having access to INTELSAT’S system, also beginning in 1982. (INTELSAT Releases 79-07-1, 79-09-1)
April 5: MSFC reported that Shuttle orbiter Enterprise would go to KSC to give NASA workers experience in prelaunch handling. After a year of tests at MSFC, Enterprise would resume the tailcone on its main-engine area for piggyback flight, and the dummy pods removed during testing would be replaced. After the refit, NASA would tow the Enterprise to Redstone Army Air Field for loading on its 747 carrier, with departure set for April 12 or 13, depending on weather.

April 10: NASA announced that Dr. Robert A. Frosch, administrator, and Dr. Willy Moenandir Mangoendiprodjo, director of Indonesia’s telecommunications agency, had signed a memorandum of understanding April 9 for launch of two Indonesian domestic communications satellites. NASA would furnish reimbursable launch and associated services for a second generation of Palapa spacecraft. The new satellites would replace existing communications satellites: Palapa A-l, launched July 8, 1976, and Palapa A-2, launched March 10, 1977. The Shuttle would launch the first Palapa B in June 1982; the second during the first half of 1983. (NASA Release 79-43)
April 13: NASA announced it would join Soviet scientists for the first time in a study of physiological changes due to simulated weightlessness. Tests in each country on 10 subjects aged between 35 and 40 would comprise two weeks of control observations, one week of bed rest, and two weeks of postrest measurements, including stress tests and blood and urine samples. Half of each group would be horizontal during the total bed rest, the others would rest with heads lowered 6° for horizontal. U.S. tests had kept subjects horizontal only, and the identical studies would indicate the best procedure. The program would begin in mid-May at the Moscow Institute of Medico-Biological Problems and continue at Ames Research Center (ARC) in July. Both NASA and USSR scientists would take part in each experiment. (NASA Release

Launched May 7, 1975, from the San Marco platform off the coast of Kenya, the 195-kilogram. Sas 3 in a 500-kilometer orbit had discovered 2 new quasars and about half the 35 known X-ray bursters (stars emitting huge brief bursts of X-rays once every few hours). Sas 3 indicated that these bursts resulted from thermonuclear reactions on the surfaces of neutron stars. (NASA Release 79-44)
April 15: The North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) issued a fact sheet on satellite decay predictions by its Space Defense Center, watching over more than 4,500 man-made satellites in orbit around the Earth. The Tracking and Impact Predictions (TIPs) gave time and position for large items such as payloads and rocket motors that might survive reentry and impact on Earth; for smaller objects likely to burn up without reaching the ground, the center would compute only a probable date of decay. Predictions would depend on many variables but were necessary under a 1971 pact between the United States and the Soviet Union that both nations would help identify objects that might reenter over the other’s territory; TIPs would prevent mistaking a reentering object for an incoming warhead and triggering warning networks.

April 16: NASA announced that an experimental balloon launched April 12 at 6:23 p.m. from the National Scientific Balloon Facility in Texas to test a new heavy-lift design had apparently failed at about 10:42 p.m. somewhere over northwestern Louisiana. The balloon measured about 41 million cubic feet and carried an instrumented payload weighing about 5,300 pounds. (Hq PAO anno Apr 16/79)
April 24: NASA reported that the Shuttle orbiter Enterprise, which arrived at KSC April 10-after a piggyback flight from MSFC, would be rolled out to Launch Complex 39 on May 1 as part of an exercise to clear the way for launch of its sister ship, Columbia, which had arrived at KSC March 24 for checkout and final installation of thermal tiles. This would be the first time a complete Space Shuttle configuration had been put together in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and moved to the launch pad; use of the Enterprise would confirm compatibility of assembly and launch facilities and ground support equipment with elements of the Shuttle and would rehearse KSC staff in Shuttle handling operations.
On April 17, a 15-story external tank was mated with two inert solid-fuel rocket boosters on a mobile launcher platform in high bay 3; more than 75,000 visitors to the center viewed the assembly moving down the 2-mile towway to the VAB, into which Enterprise was moved April 18. The delta-wing orbiter

• DOT announced that Secretary Brock Adams had sent to Congress proposed legislation to provide $6.6 billion for improving U.S. airports and airway systems over 5 years, beginning October 1, 1980. The proposal emphasized aviation safety measures to meet expected 1980s growth in air transportation. Financed by a 10 year continuation of the airport/airway trust fund and related aviation user taxes, the bill would include airport development and planning; acquisition and upgrading of airway facilities and equipment; research to reduce congestion and delays at large U.S. airports; improvement of air traffic control, instrument landing systems and radars, and other navigation aids; reduction of aircraft noise; and funding for smaller airports to reduce the load on larger ones. (DOT Release 51-79)
During April: NASA reported new data on Venus From the Pioneer mission and the radar at the Arecibo observatory in Puerto Rico. Radar had given best information on the surface of Venus, not visible through optical telescopes because of heavy cloud cover. Radar images covering an area 80 million square kilometers showed craters on Venus as large as 320 kilometers in diameter; like lunar craters, which they resembled, they apparently resulted from meteorite impacts.
A circular area 1,120 kilometers in diameter called Alpha, first noticed because of high radar reflectivity, consisted of many parallel ridges identifiable for great distances. This area had no Earth counterpart except extensive dune systems in the Arabian peninsula; Alpha showed a central dark object, possibly a volcano. Another radar feature known as Beta, with long rays of rough material extending out as far as 48 kilometers, also had a central dark area like a volcano crater. The radar also detected parallel ridges about 2,100 miles high, extending more than 960 kilometers across the surface of Venus, forming a structure exceeding the Grand Canyon in scale.
A report on Pioneer Venus orbiter and multiprobe mission findings included discovery of the largest canyon in the solar system, bigger than Mar’s Vallis Marineris, previously thought largest. Lightning activity detected by USSR Venera spacecraft was continuous from altitudes of 32 kilometers down to 2 kilometers, with discharges as frequent as 25 per second. Pioneer’s orbiter apparently saw this lightning also; experimenters Dr. Boris Ragent of ARC and Dr. Jacques Blamont of the University of Paris now theorized that a glow measured by Pioneer instruments was continuous indistinguishable lightning on Venus, rather than an occurrence on the spacecraft. The orbiter also found an 1,100-kilometer-wide hole containing few or no clouds in the North Pole cloud cover, suggesting a downflow of atmosphere there. (NASA Release

May 3: NASA announced that its satellite system ASDAR (aircraft-to-satellite data relay) had started operation as part of the GWE that began earlier this year [see January 7], collecting and relaying weather observations from aircraft in flight and leading to possible million-dollar savings annually in aviation fuel costs. The system, consisting of a power supply, clock, 80-watt transmitter, small computer, and antenna, would monitor and report eight times per hour the aircraft’s location and altitude, together with weather data generated by equipment already aboard each ASDAR-equipped airliner.
The system would relay the information through a NOAA satellite to weather data centers and on to the users. Relay of quickly changing weather information to subsequent flights within two hours could save time and fuel by taking advantage of favorable winds or avoiding threatening storms. Also, the 17 widebody jets using ASDAR would regularly cross the southern hemisphere and the tropics, where data were not usually available. Participating countries included England, Australia, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries, Singapore, and the United States (NASA Release 79-51)
NASA also reported that ARC’s research aircraft Galileo II had gone to Saudi Arabia to join an international study of the monsoon, a storm system bringing nearly all the Asian subcontinent’s annual rainfall in June, July, and August, supplying torrents of moisture for the crops and overwhelming the area in floods. In 1978 the storms killed more than 900 people and left more than 3 million homeless. MONEX (the monsoon experiment) would trace the origin of the storms and attempt to provide weather forecasts that would be “extremely useful” in an area “practically devoid of basic weather data,” according to Joachim Kuettner, director of the U.S. effort.

May 4: NASA launched FltSatCom-B, second in a series of five fleet satellite communications system spacecraft, from Cape Canaveral on an Atlas Centaur at 2:56 p.m. into a transfer orbit, before firing its apogee kick motor May 6 to move it toward a 23,300-mile altitude synchronous-orbit station over 23 °W, which it should reach in late July. This was the 50th launch by an Atlas Centaur. The TRW-built 4,100-pound FltSatCom 2 was about 880 pounds heavier than any previously launched by this vehicle, requiring it to take a path offset 2.4° from the equator. Like its predecessor FltSatCom 1 launched in 1978, now on station over 100 °W, FltSatCom 2 would link ships, submarines, and planes to various ground-based control centers and would provide service to White House communications centers.

May 8: NASA reported that LaRC staffers were using the SAGE satellite launched from WFC February 18 to measure and track into the stratosphere the ash and gases from an eruption of La Soufriere, a volcano on St. Vincent island in the Caribbean, between April 13 and 17. The eruption, detected first by SAGE while passing over the island April 23, deposited as much as an inch of dust on neighboring islands and provided an opportunity to study stratosphere distribution of aerosols from a single source. NASA alerted scientists around the world to use ground-based and balloon-borne instruments in checking between 6°N and 20 °N latitudes for effects of the eruption. SAGE might answer questions about the effect of aerosols and ozone on climate and environmental quality. (NASA Release 79-56; LaRC Release 79-29; WFC Release 79-8)
• NASA reported that since February 14 the infrared instrument on Pioneer Venus orbiter had been returning “degraded data”; efforts to solve the problem had not succeeded. The instrument began to register a power input of 6 to 7 volts instead of the required 10 volts; it had done this three times before, but each time ground command was able to reset the instrument with almost no loss of information. The orbiter had returned excellent data for 72 orbits of Venus (one per day) including more than 800,000 temperature profile, albedo, humidity, and cloud height measurements, enough for a thorough survey of the planet. NASA’s radiometer-science team reported that results already exceeded mission objectives despite the apparent loss of the instrument. Dr. Fred W. Taylor of JPL said the instrument might yet be revived. (NASA Release 79-59)
May 10: MSFC reported that 1.5-second ignition-test firings May 4 of a cluster of three Space Shuttle main engines at National Space Technology Laboratories (NSTL) had been successful, clearing the way for the second phase of verification tests. The three flight-type engines, previously acceptance tested individually at the facility, had undergone the cluster test in an assembly including the engines, a simulated orbiter midbody, and a flight-type aft fuselage to which the engines were fitted. Frank Stewart, MSFC test manager, said that sequencing was good and that he foresaw no problems with the first long-duration firing scheduled for May 15. The tests would evaluate system performance in a static-firing environment as a step in verifying the system for the first manned orbital Shuttle flight. Cluster firings would take place about once per month through July; the third phase of long-duration firings would begin in September and conclude in November, after the equipment had been modified.

Scheduled for use on Columbia, this engine would undergo electrical and mechanical checkout before formal acceptance. The tests began April 25 with 1.5-second ignition-test firing, followed by a 100-second calibration-test firing May 2. After formal acceptance, the engine would go by truck to KSC for installation. The other two of the cluster of three Rockwell-built engines to be used on Columbia were at Space Technology Laboratories for the same series of tests. (MSFC Release 79-45; NASA Release 79-68)
May 16: NASA reported that the multispectral scanner on Landsat 3 had begun sending defective images at random; the pulse to trigger a line-start signal was not working. The scanner images, line-by-line transmissions of views from an oscillating mirror, would form a continuous line unless arranged one under the other by line-start and line-end scan pulses. GSFC engineers noticed that lines normally printed under the preceding line to fill in a picture were either missing a start signal or lacking about a fourth of the line. Last fall they had solved a similar problem by switching to a backup system, the one now malfunctioning.
Since its launch March 15, 1978, Landsat 3 had transmitted more than 91,000 scenes each representing an area 185 square kilometers of Earth’s surface, used to produce either photographs or computer tapes. The equipment needed to correct for the missing data would not be available until later in 1979, the agency said; however, most Landsat 3 data were still accurate, and Landsat 2. was still “going strong” after producing more than 325,000 scanner scenes since 1975.

May 17: NASA announced that Dr. Robert A. Frosch, its administrator, would head a 13-member delegation of U.S. officials to the People’s Republic of China May 19-June 3 to learn about PRC space activities and discuss areas of planned cooperation, including a PRC domestic communications satellite system and ground station for PRC reception of Landsat data. The U.S. group, including representatives of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, National Security Council, State Department, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NOAA, and U.S. Geological Survey, would meet with PRC officials in Beijing and tour their space installations. Frosch would return to the United States, after the Beijing meetings. The group had been invited by Dr. Jen Xin-min, head of the PRC Academy of Space Technology and leader of a space delegation that visited NASA and space industry firms in 1978; President Carter and PRC vice premier Deng Xiaoping had signed an agreement on space cooperation January 31, 1979.

May 23: ESA reported that the first qualification test of its Ariane launcher first stage had been “satisfactory” May 17 with further tests scheduled for early autumn. The 139-second duration (nominal operating time) had tested the resistance of nozzle-throat linings, which had been modified, and propellant depletion. The second stage had completed tests that began last October; the third stage was currently undergoing tests. (ESA/CNES Release No. 17)
May 28: The U.S. Air Force launched a DOD surveillance spacecraft from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 11:30 a.m. PDT on a Titan 3B-Agena into an orbit with 323-kilometer apogee, 126-kilometer perigee, 89-minute period, and 96.4° inclination. DOD made no announcement, but press reports said that the launch was probably a low-resolution search-and-find mission; this type of system would remain in orbit about 2.5 months. (NASA wkly SSR, May 24-30; D/SD, May 31/79, 149; AvWk, June 11/79, 23)
May 29: The Washington Star reported on a NASA Pioneer Venus briefing at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington, D.C., which revealed that Venus (far from being the dull and featureless object it appeared, covered by heavy cloud layers) had spectacular terrain and a unique atmospheric circulation system. Pioneer Venus 1 had been sending back radar and other information since it arrived at Venus in December 1978; Pioneer Venus 2 had arrived shortly thereafter, separating into five probes to study the atmosphere, four of which reached the “smoldering 900° F surface.”
Dr. Harold Masursky of the U.S. Geological Survey reported that radar scans of Venus had shown a mountain estimated at 27,000 feet, far higher than Earth’s 29,028-foot Mt. Everest. Dr. Alvin Seiff of ARC said that Venus’s atmospheric circulation was different from any known elsewhere: Earth’s surface absorbed sunlight, and the resulting heat in combination with Earth’s rotation made the atmosphere flow west to east. However, the atmosphere of Venus absorbed the sunlight 30 to 35 miles above the surface, and heat variations in the atmospheric layers apparently drove one another with their motion. (W Star, May 29/79, A-2)
May 30: INTELSAT announced a first step toward intersatellite communications links: an award of a $170,000 contract to Hughes Aircraft Company for design and fabrication of a traveling-wave tube, a vital component of an intersatellite link. Direct transmission via satellite was now possible only between points within one satellite’s coverage area (about one-third of Earth’s surface); messages for locations outside that area had to use land-based links or ground

relay to a second satellite. The planned communications links could transmit directly from one satellite to another, saving one down and one up transmission, freeing that link for other use, and making the whole system more efficient and economical by making more stations available to direct access. (INTELSAT Release 79-10-1)
May 31: Photographs of Jupiter’s moon Io taken by Voyager 1 had revealed a strange “blue snow,” identified as volcanic gases released by continuous eruptions in the equatorial region, the New York Times reported. Dr. Laurence A. Soderblom of the U.S. Geological Survey told the American Geophysical Union spring meeting in Washington, D.C., that wisps of the gas appeared in Io’s south polar area along faults or fractures in the crust; this was the first finding of erupting volcanoes anywhere except on Earth, and the intense volcanic activity was “endlessly repaving [Io’s] surface with volcanic material.”
Dr. Edward C. Stone of the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), chief Voyager mission scientist, said that a change in the Voyager 2 plan would include time-lapse photography of Io to pinpoint the nature of the volcanic activity. Dr. John C. Pearl of GSFC said Voyager 7’s infrared detectors showed that the main constituent of the gases was sulfur dioxide, also found in Earth’s volcanic eruptions. Dr. Norman F. Ness, also of GSFC, said Jupiter’s magnetic field extended far beyond Io’s orbit, creating a “big power station in the sky.” (NY Times, May 31/79, B-16)
During May: NASA reported that the X-ray telescope on Heao 2 had photographed for the first time an X-ray “burster,” a “bizarre” phenomenon occurring when compact celestial objects less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) in diameter increase suddenly and intensely in X-ray brightness. Such a burst, releasing more X-ray energy in 10 seconds than the Sun does in a week, was first discovered by a Netherlands/U.S. cooperative satellite carrying Harvard-Smithsonian detectors in 1976.
Scientists had not defined the nature of the bursts, which might result from explosions similar to a helium bomb on the surface of a neutron star or from violent instabilities in gas flow down a black hole. Heao 2’s picture, said Jonathan Grindlay of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, established the presence of a “steady” X-ray source in a “globular cluster” called Terzan 2, bringing the number of such clusters known to harbor X-ray sources to at least eight, six of these being bursters. The cores of globular clusters (oldest objects in the galaxy, consisting of round swarms of about
100,000	stars) were under study as possible precursors of black holes or of compact binary systems containing either neutron stars or black holes being formed to produce bursting X-ray sources. (NASA Release 79-65)

as chief scientist, announced plans to retire June 29, 1979. After receiving a doctorate in physics in 1953 from the University of Minnesota, where he worked before joining the Convair scientific research laboratory, he began his NASA service at GSFC in 1959 as head of the nuclear emulsion section. Naugle served in 1961 as chief of physics in Physics and Astronomy Programs, Office of Space Science; as director of physics and astronomy programs in the Office of Space Science and Applications from 1962 to 1966; as associate administrator for space science and applications in 1967; and as deputy associate administrator of NASA in 1974, becoming associate administrator in 1975. In a reorganization of 1977, he assumed the duties of chief scientist. Dr. Robert A. Frosch, NASA administrator, said Naugle was “an effective proponent for space, an international negotiator of distinction, a leader and a guide to a generation of managers.” (NASA anno May 9/79; NASA Release 79-63)
—Dr. Robert S. Cooper, director of GSFC since July 1, 1976, announced he would resign June 1 to become vice president for engineering at Satellite Business Systems. Cooper came to GSFC from DOD, where he was assistant director for defense research and engineering, beginning in 1972. He was a research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory and, before that, a professor at MIT. He attended the University of Iowa and Ohio State University and received a doctorate in 1963 from MIT in electrical engineering. (NASA Release 79-60)
—JSC announced retirement May 18 of deputy director Sigurd A. Sjoberg after 37 years of service with NASA and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). He joined NACA in 1942 as an electrical engineer and went to Houston when his group was relocated from Hampton, Va. He became director of flight operations in 1969 and deputy director of JSC in 1972. He would manage Houston operations for OAO Corporation (JSC Release 79-24; NASA Release 79-58)
—NASA announced appointment of Dr. Thomas A. Mutch as associate administrator for space science, effective July 1. Mutch, professor of geological sciences at Brown University, received a doctorate in geology from Princeton University in 1960 and had been a member of NASA's lunar science review board from 1969 to 1973, leader of the Viking project’s lander imaging science team, and chairman of several NASA committees planning post-Viking exploration of Mars. A mountain climber, he had visited the Himalayas twice, most recently in 1978 with a group from Brown University. (NASA Release 79-72)
—NASAreported that astronaut Fred W. Haise, Jr., would resign at the end of June to become vice president for space programs at Grumman Aerospace. He began as a NASA research pilot at LeRC in 1959, followed by three years at DFRC, and was one of 19 astronauts selected in April 1966. As pilot of Apollo 73’s lunar module, he assisted in converting it into a “lifeboat” for the crew after an explosion in the service module about 55 hours after launch. He had been technical assistant to the manager of the Space Shuttle orbiter project and commanded one of the two crews piloting the Enterprise in

• FBIS reported on the status of the Soyuz 32 crew in its continuing flight aboard Salyut 6. Since launch February 25, Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin had done daily exercises and physical tests, noted by Soviet press services as “the cosmonauts are feeling well.” Their May 3 activity was experimenting on the Kristall equipment, making “semiconductor monocrystals” of indium arsenide. On May 4 they operated a “submillimeter telescope” gathering data to predict cyclones in tropical zones of Earth. A commentator noted that this equipment was complicated, requiring exact calibration each time it was used, and could be aimed only by turning the entire station. On May 6 they used a “gamma telescope” to measure gamma radiation and charged particles in near-Earth space. On May 8 they replaced their television transmitter with a new one brought by Progress 5. On May 9-10 they used the Kristall to experiment with cadmium sulfide.
Tass reported May 13 the launch of Progress 6; a commentator said that the cargo ship contained “an unusual present” to the crew, a tulip scheduled to bloom in space. An ongoing task was to study the efforts of weightlessness and “other space flight factors” on plant growth; small hothouses aboard the Salyut could provide fresh food containing vitamins. The crew was growing green onions; they had reaped their first harvest and “ate it with the permission of biologists.” They also had fennel, parsley, and garlic; Tass noted that “Despite successes of chemistry.. .scientists have not yet managed to create the same vitamins as in nature.” The cosmonauts on Soyuz 29 had repeatedly described the mushrooms they were picking as “really strange.. .their form was unusual with curly stems...”. “Nevertheless,” Tass said, “[the crew had been] greatly pleased. All living things evoke their enhanced interest. . .a psychological backup in their difficult work.” The tulip in outer space, “merely an experiment to scientists,” was for the cosmonauts “a symbol of spring” and an expression of solicitude for the crew that had been working for a long time in isolation. Progress 6 docked May 15, and the crew was unloading cargo and reloading used equipment for the next fortnight. The major job was refueling, difficult and complex in space, but the crew had completed it by May 28. (FBIS, Moscow Tass in English, Dom Svc in Russian, Inti Svc in Russian, May 3-28/79)

June 1: NASA announced plans to shift Skylab into a lower-drag attitude that could extend its life up to 12 hours, during which the reentry area might shift by thousands of miles. Reentry was predicted between June 27 and July 21; the “footprint” of resulting debris would be about 160 kilometers wide and 6,400 kilometers long. About 24 hours before reentry, it might be possible to predict the most likely area where debris might reach the surface, but with a wide margin of error. “Drag modulation” would offer the possibility of shifting Skylab’s orbit to pass over less populated areas, reducing the chance of damage or injury. (NASA Release 79-80; JSC Release 79-37)
June 2: NASA launched UK 6 from WFC at 7:26 p.m. EDT on a Scout into an orbit with 656 kilometer apogee, 607-kilometer perigee, 55° inclination, and 97.5-minute period. Under the terms of a contract of March 16, 1976, between NASA and the U.K. Science Research Council, the launch was the second on a fully reimbursable basis, at an estimated cost to the United Kingdom of $4,956,733, including booster, support services, tracking and data acquisition, and use of U.S. facilities.
The British-built spacecraft, weighing 340.6 pounds carried an experiment to measure the charge and energy spectra of galactic cosmic rays, and two X-ray astronomy experiments on structure and position of low-energy sources and on fluctuations in X-ray emission from low galactic latitude sources. UK 6 would carry two experiments for the Royal Aircraft Establishment to study performance in orbit of new types of solar cell and the susceptibility of metal-oxide semiconductor devices to radiation in a space environment. NASA judged the mission successful as of October 1979. (NASA Release 79-61, 79-78; NASA MOR M-490-301-79-02 [prelaunch] May 14/79, [postlaunch] Oct 18/79)
June 4: The $220 million requested by the President as an amendment to NASA’s Space Shuttle program was “essential to allow the... program to proceed in a reasonable manner,” Dr. William J. Perry, undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, told the Senate subcommittee on science, technology, and space. Noting that NASA’s launch predictions were based on the supplemental funding, Perry said DOD was concerned about the adequacy of the Shuttle fleet to meet traffic demands sure to build rapidly “once the Shuttle is operational.” DOD planned to transfer “several programs important to our national security” to Shuttle launch by 1983, and delays in orbiter delivery would mean further use of expendable launch vehicles, with “adverse operational and economic impact.” A House appropriations subcommittee

June 7; The Soviet Union launched Bhaskara, an Earth-observation satellite, for the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) from the Kapustin Yar cosmodrome at 2 p.m. local time on an SS-5 Skean vehicle into an orbit with 541-kilometer apogee, 518-kilometer perigee, 50.7° inclination, and 95.2-minute period. Named for an ancient Indian astronomer, the
1,000-pound India-built spacecraft was the second launched for India by the Soviet Union; it carried television cameras and equipment for studying hydrology, meteorology, and forestry. India’s first satellite, launched about four years ago, was still in orbit and functioning well.

June 10: DOD launched a “classified payload” at 9:38 a.m. local time from Cape Canaveral on a Titan 3C into a geosynchronous orbit with 36,261-kilometer apogee, 35,802-kilometer perigee, 1,448.6-minute period, and 2.0° inclination. The U.S. Air Force had no comment on press speculation about the launch. The New York Times said “such satellites are used to monitor Russian and Chinese launches [and to warn] American officials if a missile is launched from a submarine at sea.” Aviation Week & Space Technology said that the payload had “orbital characteristics of previously launched early warning satellites.” (NASA wkly SSR, June 7-13; NY Times, June 11/79, B-6; W Post, June 11/79, A-9; Today, June 11/79, 1A, 8A; AvWk, June 18/79, 13)
June 11: MSFC announced that on June 13 it would begin flight-qualification testing of a Space Shuttle solid-fuel rocket booster at the Thiokol range near Promontory Point, Utah, to demonstrate the production, assembly, and firing cycle for a full series of Shuttle flights. Assembled from four segments, the 35-meter-long motor would first be static-fired to demonstrate “ablative safety factors” of the motor nozzle, which would be gimbaled to simulate control during a launch. Designed to move 8° in any direction, the nozzle would be

part of the Shuttle guidance system. Insulation and ablative materials would protect the motor from heat during firing. (MSFC Release 79-54)
The first flight-qualification firing of a Shuttle motor was “quite satisfactory,” said George Hardy, manager of the booster project at MSFC. After witnessing the firing in the Utah desert, Hardy said that the amount of thrust developed and the performance of the steering nozzles was “well within specifications.” The motor and igniter had been modified as a result of test firings of four development motors during the past two years. Static tests of the flight-configured solid-fuel rocket booster that each Shuttle mission would use in pairs would complete qualification testing. (MSFC Release 79-60)
June 12: After almost a month of waiting for good weather, the first man-powered flight across the English Channel took off at 5:50 a.m. from Folkestone, arriving at Cap Gris Nez in 2 hours, 55 minutes. Bryan Allen, 26, a cyclist, hang-glider, and biologist from California who, at 137 pounds was nearly twice as heavy as his craft, pedaled the 70-pound gossamer Albatross (built of carbon-filament tubing and covered in transparent mylar) nonstop for 25 miles. Rules were that the craft must be heavier than air, must be propelled only by the crew, must not fly higher than 160 feet, and must not discard any parts in flight. Allen had traveled an average of 6 to 8 feet above the water but had dipped to within a foot of the surface several times when strong winds arose about halfway over.
The flight won a $205,000 Kremer prize (“almost enough to pay the costs”) and a niche in history for aeronautical designer Paul MacCready, who also built the Gossamer Condor that in August 1977 won a $102,500 Kremer prize for the world’s first controlled man-powered flight, steered by Allen around a 1.15-mile figure-8 course in California. The Condor was now on display in the National Air and Space Museum. U.K. industrialist Henry Kremer had established the prizes to be awarded by the Royal Aeronautical Society, which called the Channel crossing “a tremendous achievement.” (NY Times, June 13/79, A-l, A-8; W Post, June 13/79; A-l; W Star, June 12/79, A-l; June 14/79, A-18)
• The May 25 crash of a DC-10 aircraft killing 275 was predictable in view of previous problems with that plane, Rep. John L. Burton (D-Calif.), chairman, told a House subcommittee on transportation June 11. He asked Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator Langhorne Bond why the FAA had twice previously grounded the DC-lOs for inspection and twice sent them into the air again. After the accident, the FAA waited for 13 days to ground the DC-lOs, “and then only because a federal judge.. .acting on a suit brought by the Airline Passengers Association ordered them to do it,” Washington Star columnist Mary McGrory noted.
Engine-mounting pylons, which an FAA memo from California not seen by Bond had called a design fault, apparently caused some of the problems. Bond said that what McGrory called “the worst plane tragedy in U.S. history” was

“a single, severe event” when “that pylon experienced an overload of that wing and those fasteners,” insisting that FAA’s actions were proper at the time. Rep. Burton said that since 1974 the FAA had had many pylon problem reports; Bond said they did not form a pattern, as they concerned “individual and random defects in an entire area. . .there was no trend.” In 1975, McDonnell Douglas had suggested some remedies for problems with the pylons; Bond told the subcommittee that manufacturers’ suggestions were not mandatory, and the FAA did not make the airlines follow them. {W Star, June 12/79, A-2, A-4)
•	Neil Armstrong, “America’s reluctant space hero,” said the United States should develop a permanent manned orbiting space station for long-duration exposure of people and equipment to the space environment. At an interview about the 10th anniversary of the moon landing, the University of Cincinnati engineering professor who in 1969 had been the first man to walk on the moon said that, if the United States had an ongoing manned space program, “we could have solved the problems” with Skylab. {Today, June 12/79, 16A)
June 14: MSFC reported that the seven-member science crew for the first Spacelab mission was conducting a three-day crew-station review, using a Spacelab mockup just completed in MSFC’s Materials and Processes Laboratory. The review would evaluate experiment designs together with written procedures, the ensure proper crew-equipment interface, especially the location of switches, controls, and displays. (MSFC Release 79-57)
•	MSFC said a long-duration test firing of the Shuttle main propulsion system scheduled June 12 was successful, even though a glitch in the automatic-cutoff instrumentation had terminated the test about 50 seconds into the 520 second program.
Frank Stewart, test manager for MSFC’s Shuttle projects office, said that the test was successful “in the sense that the system performed as predicted and yielded a great deal of valuable data” needed before the first Shuttle flight. Stewart said the firing sequence was excellent. For the first time in test firing of three flight engines, the rated power level was attained, and the test produced pogo pulsing (a deliberate oscillation from very low to very high frequencies generated by a piston in the liquid-oxygen manifold, to show if vibrations in flight would constitute resonance dangerous to structures).
This first long-duration firing of the clustered flight-type engines and propulsion system had already been delayed by malfunction of a development engine during single-engine tests. Inspection after the failure revealed a crack in the coolant pipe, requiring removal of the engine nozzle. Engineers modified a spare nozzle for installation in the test article. Stewart said the event should not delay the total test schedule, which included extra time for unforeseen difficulties. System verification should be complete “in ample time for the first Shuttle flight,” he said. (MSFC Release 79-58)

• Ceremonies at Block Island, R.I., dedicated the third NASA-Department of Energy wind turbine, designed to provide 5% to 15% of the island’s power and up to half in winter when winds are strongest. The windmill’s 125-foot aluminum blades would interfere with local television reception, officials said; DOE would spend about $700,000 for a cable television system, besides $2.3 million for the windmill. Later versions might have wooden or fiberglass blades to avoid interference.
Residents said that their electric rates were the nation’s highest—20% more than New York City’s and double those of the mainland 12 miles away. The island used diesel generators, with fuel brought by barge. (WPost, June 16/79, A-3)
June 20: NASA announced an MSFC award to General Dynamics Convair of a $250,000 contract to study feasibility of a space platform in geostationary Earth orbit carrying many separate payloads. The platform would contain plug-in equipment to accommodate communications, Earth resources, meteorology, and similar studies now flown on separate satellites.
Preliminary MSFC investigations indicated that a platform could be built in space and located in a synchronous orbit at 40,000 kilometers to offer power and other functions to “tenant” missions parked there for a fee-like rent. Platform services such as power, available to all tenants, would eliminate the need for antennas, solar arrays, or batteries on individual payloads, reducing size and launch weight. Locating packages on a single platform would also simplify in-orbit repair and servicing. (NASA Release 79-82; MSFC Release

June 20-21: Newspapers nationwide reported that NASA was now predicting Skylab reentry between July 7 and 25, probably July 16. Thomas O’Toole wrote in the Washington Post that the descending space station would be visible in the sky over Washington, D.C., this week for the Last time before it broke up and fell to Earth. Atmospheric friction would destroy most of it, NASA said, but two heavy pieces (an airlock shroud and a lead-lined film vault) weighing 3,900 pounds and 5,000 pounds would probably hit Earth about 500 miles apart, the airlock being outside the station and the vault inside. The Washington Star said JSC controllers had “prodded” the Skylab into a sidewise attitude that might allow them to steer the station away from inhabited areas. NORAD agreed that reentry was probable on or before July 16. (W Post, June 20/79, A-ll; W Star, June 21, A-4)

June 26: NASA issued a press kit on Voyager 2’s coming encounter with Jupiter July 9, describing the modifications resulting from Voyager 1 findings. As the images from the latter in its January approach revealed changes on Jupiter differing from observations by Pioneer 11 four years earlier, so Voyager 2 had sent back images that differed in the shorter term on its approach. Its pictures of Jupiter relayed from 56 million kilometers had already exceeded the best resolution possible with Earth telescopes. (NASA Release

To detect potential weaknesses in systems or hardware, engineers would remove selected components and inspect them for wear and tear; after inspection and analysis of test data, the same test series would be repeated on the same engine to simulate typical mission profiles. J.R. Thompson, MSFC’s main-engine project manager, said that engine performance and operation during the test series was very satisfactory. Rockwell conducted the tests at NSTL. (MSFC Release 79-69)
June 30: NASA said that it had turned off Applications Technology Satellite 6 (ATS 6) and would boost it to a higher orbit August 6. ATS 6 had lost three of its four thrusters and would be a hazard to other spacecraft if it failed on station. Launched in May 1974, it had exceeded its design lifetime by three years; transmitting directly to small ground receivers, it had relayed educational, scientific, and health programs to stations worldwide. “Firsts” includ-

During June: NASA announced that Arnold W. Frutkin, associate administrator for external relations since November 1978, would retire June 27. For 18 years before his present appointment, he had headed NASA’s Office of International Affairs and was credited with “an extraordinarily successful series” of international space endeavors and policy initiatives including ATS 6 broadcasts, U.S.-USSR arrangements for Apollo-Soyuz, ESA Spacelab agreement, and multinational work on NASA science and applications missions. He had come to NASA from the National Academy of Sciences, where he was deputy director of the U.S. committee for the International Geophysical Year (IGY). (NASA anno June 1/79; NASA Release 79-85) JSC announced the appointment of Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, veteran NASA manager for manned spaceflight projects, to direct JSC operations at KSC, completing installation of the thermal protection tiles and internal vehicle systems on the orbiter Columbia. Kleinknecht, who had joined NACA in 1942, would report to KSC from permanent assignment in Paris as deputy associate administrator for STS (European operations). (JSC Release 79-39) WFC announced that its associate director, Abraham Spinak, would be on special assignment as executive assistant to a special NASA senior-staff group evaluating management of the STS. The group would study Shuttle funding problems, uncertainties of program predictions, and information flow and control. (WFC Release 79-12)
•	ESA reported successful completion of exercises at Kourou, French Guiana, to prepare for Ariane launches, including assembly of a test launcher, filling and draining of propellant, and automatic countdown. The operation was to verify the launch team’s competence and the suitability of the site for the launch program scheduled to begin in September. (ESA/CNES Release June 6/79)
•	FBIS continued to report the status of the Soyuz 32 crew aboard Salyut 6. Beginning their 14th week in orbit, the crew prepared the shower stall and
used it; they also used the Splav (alloy) furnace to make “foam metals” in a Soviet-Bulgarian experiment for low weight and high mechanical qualities. (On June 2, Reuters reported that a joint Soviet-Hungarian flight had been called off because of “serious trouble” with the Salyut 6 and predicted delays of 4 to 5 months or even a year in further joint manned flight. This would have been the 5th USSR joint mission with eastern-bloc countries.) On June 4, in the 15th week, the crew observed Far Eastern forests and corrected Salyut 6’s orbit using the Progress 6 engines. On June 5, the crew was congratulated by the Soyuz 29 record-holding crew for completing 100 days in orbit.

Soyuz 34, an unmanned ferry vessel launched June 6 “to check a crucial engine that failed during a manned mission in April,” might serve as return vehicle for the Soyuz 32 crew besides bringing supplies, press reports said. The April mission that failed to dock (Soyuz 33) had been crewed by Nikolay Rukavishnikov (veteran of Soyuz 10 and 16) and Georgy Ivanov, first Bulgarian cosmonaut. A June 6 report said the specific part found at fault in Soyuz 32 had previously been tested 8,000 times with no defect evident; nevertheless, the modified Soyuz 34 was launched unmanned to prevent possible casualty. Soyuz 34 docked successfully June 9 in the space formerly used by Progress 6, which had been set loose June 8 to deorbit over the Pacific Ocean.
The crew sent away Soyuz 32, loaded with used equipment and experiment material, for a soft landing June 13. Later June reports from scientists studying the returned material said that future stations would allow for larger numbers of meteorite impacts; for the first time, returned equipment was available for analysis, such as devices that operated for 600 days rather than the planned 100, and lamps that “had not worked out their term.” (FBIS, Tass in English, Inti Svc in Russian, Dom Svc in Russian, June 1-30/79)

July 3: JSC reported that it had amended its contract with Rockwell International Corporation to cover 56 engineering changes in the Space Shuttle or-biter. The first amendment, covering 32 changes, would cost $14,338,000; the second, covering 24 changes plus testing, repairs, and spares, would cost $2,869,833. The control value was now about $3.43 billion. (JSC Release

• INTELSAT reported from its meeting just ended in Washington, D.C., that international telecommunications by satellite would increase nearly 100% by 1983. More than 200 delegates representing more than 100 nations at the week-long meeting had pooled forecasts of services needed from INTELSAT’s satellite system. The biggest growth would be in the Atlantic region, where traffic might increase 114% by year-end 1983. The new Intelsat V satellites soon to be launched could carry 12,000 simultaneous phone calls plus two television channels—double the capacity of present satellites. Planning was under way for satellites with 40,000-circuit capacity. (INTELSAT Release

July 6: ESA reported signing a contract with NASA July 5 authorizing the order of long lead-time materiel and components for construction of a second Spacelab flight unit to be delivered “progressively” to NASA in 1982-83. ESA had signed a simultaneous contract with ERNO of Bremen, Germany, as prime contractor. ESA said that this was the first time the United States had placed an order for “work of such importance” with the European industrial consortium representing some 50 firms, headed by ERNO. (ESA Release July 6/79)
July 9: NASA announced that MSFC had appointed a board to investigate the automatic cutoff of a test firing July 2 at NSTL of the Space Shuttle main-engine test article (three main engines mounted in an orbiter aft section and attached to an external tank). A liquid-hydrogen leak from a main fuel valve caused the cutoff after 18.5 seconds; no explosion occurred, and the gaseous nitrogen and water fire-control systems put out an external fire resulting from hydrogen accumulation around the test article’s aft area. Inspection revealed damage to the aft heat shield and charring of external-tank insulation, but the engines appeared generally in good condition. (NASA Release 79-92)

570 million miles a flood of scientific data and “stunning photographs of the planet and some of its moons,” as the New York Times described them. Scientists at the JPL, control center for the mission, said that the flight was continuing to provide them with “new surprises.” They had modified observing sequences on Voyager 2 to benefit from discoveries by Voyager 1 on its encounter in March. Changes included more darkside images of the planet to measure lightning and aurora; images of Jupiter’s ring, taken away from the equatorial plane; and about nine hours of continuous imaging of Io for volcanic activity. Voyager 2’s inward track past three of the four “Galilean” satellites had let it see regions not viewed by Voyager 1; its path was “more conservative,” as it passed 10 Jupiter radii above the visible clouds compared to Voyager i’s 4.9 radii, for “complementary observations.” Voyager 2 studies began April 25 and would continue for a seven month look compared to Voyager Ts three month look. Voyager 2 had been launched August 20, 1977; Voyager 1, launched September 5, 1977, on a faster and shorter course, had overtaken its sister ship before the end of the year.
Scientists found that Jupiter and its moons did not resemble planets or satellites nearer the Sun, nor one another. Surprises in the findings were due, they said, to real differences between the outer and inner solar system and lack of previous knowledge, a result of the distance separating Earth from Jupiter. Before Voyager 1, “we thought we had some idea of what planets were like,” said Laurence A. Soderblom of the U.S. Geological Survey after seeing Europa images from Voyager 2. Instead of a sphere heavily pocked such as Earth’s moon and Mars from meteor impacts, Voyager 2 images showed Europa “as smooth as a billiard ball,” with hardly any craters on a surface covered by a mantle of slushy snow and ice up to 60 miles deep, with far-reaching shallow marks like cracks in an eggshell. The spacecraft passed Callisto and Ganymede on its way toward Europa and, after its encounter with Jupiter, had begun a 10-hour watch for Io, where it photographed six volcanoes erupting. On its approach to Jupiter, Voyager 2 had encountered radiation so intense that JPL had turned off a sensitive ultraviolet (UV) detector six hours earlier than planned; however, project director Ray Heacock declared “no problems and no failures in any of our instruments.” (JPL Release 901; NASA MOR S-802-77-01/02, June 26/79; NY Times, July 10/79, C-l; W Post, July 10/79, A-10; W Star, July 11/79, A-4; July 13/79, A-10)
July 10-15: Amid disaster predictions, Skylab deorbited over the Indian Ocean with pieces falling on Australia: impact at 1637 GMT (about 11:37 a.m. EDT, or 37 minutes after midnight local time) July 11 sent debris across the Australian outback, with no reports of damage or injury. Australian officials had only an 8-minute notice of Skylab’s approach: “We nearly had a heart attack” when told that it would cross the coast, said one. (NORAD had lost contact at 12:02 a.m. local time and assumed splashdown into the Indian Ocean, with debris coming no closer to Australia than a few hundred miles.)

Tass said that western Australia authorities had “warned the population that some parts of Skylab might be radioactive and urged. .. caution in approaching them.” At a NASA press conference a few days earlier, a reporter asked how NASA could tell if someone brought in a piece of debris claiming falsely that it was part of Skylab. Richard G. Smith, deputy associate administrator, space transportation systems, who had been “actively in charge of Skylab activities for NASA,” replied that “it is very easy to identify an object that’s been in space. The high-energy particles that penetrate it in orbit give an extremely low-level but characteristic radiation background—no radiation for anybody to be worried about.. .But it’s very easy to determine that.” United Press International (UPI) reported July 13 that the Kalgoorlie town hall had squeezed into its lobby the biggest fragment recovered so far, a 6.5-foot by 3.25-foot cylindrical piece of metal bearing a stamped number 102: “very good for the tourist industry,” said Mayor Ray Finlayson.

July 12: INTELSAT would mark the 10th anniversary of its global communications satellite system begun July 15, 1969, when an Intelsat 3 satellite went into service over the Indian Ocean; Intelsat 3 satellites were already covering the Atlantic and Pacific. It had been just over 5 years since launch of the first commercial communications satellite (Early Bird, nickname of Intelsat I) April 6, 1965. “Best of all,” INTELSAT said, its charges for leased telephone circuits by satellite had decreased 71.2% over 10 years despite inflation.

July 13: Pioneer 10 had become the first U.S. craft to fly beyond Mars, Today reported. An Associated Press (AP) story said Pioneer 10, now 2 billion miles from home, had crossed the orbit of Uranus July 11 on its way out of the solar system. Launched in March 1972, Pioneer 10 sent back the first close-up views of Jupiter 21 months later and continued to transmit “valuable data about unexplored space and the outer solar system,” said NASA spokesman Duke Reiber. A spokesman for TRW, which built both Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, said Pioneer 10 would cross Pluto’s orbit in 1987. (Today, July 13/79, 10A; NASA Release 79-84)

• The Washington Star reported that DOD would begin next week a long-awaited fly-off to see who would get a $2 billion contract to produce air-launched cruise missiles. The U.S. Air Force said that the missile was “desperately needed” to fill a gap in the U.S. weapons system created by President Carter’s decision to scrap the B-l bomber. Launched from a B-52 flying off the coast of California, the missiles would fly to a target southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. W Star, July 13/79, A-4)
July 15: Astronauts interviewed in Las Vegas, Nev., on the eve of an Apollo 11 10th anniversary commemoration noted the lack of funding and support for the space program on the part of the U.S. government. James McDivitt, who commanded Apollo 9, said that he foresaw nothing like the Apollo program coming along. Ron Evans, command-module pilot for Apollo 17, said that spectacular space events were not in the cards for the next 20 years. Charles Duke, 10th man to walk on the Moon; A1 Worden, Apollo 15 command-module pilot; and Dick Gordon, Apollo 12 command-module pilot, said the Shuttle system was not as safe as craft used in previous manned programs, as “Congress isn’t ready to give NASA the money it needs.” (Today, July 15/79, 20A; W Post, July 15/79, A-4; P Inq, July 17/79, 11)
July 16: ComSatCorp announced the official beginning of the new International Maritime Satellite Organization, INMARSAT, to operate a global maritime communications network. ComSatCorp would represent the United States in the new body. INMARSAT’S board, which would eventually represent 22 member nations, had met for the first time this date at Brighton, England. The new group would begin its operations in the 1980s after taking over from Marisat (developed and managed by ComSatCorp’s wholly owned subsidiary Comsat General), which for three years had provided communications services to the U.S. Navy and commercial shipping and offshore industries.

July 16-21: U.S. observances of the 10th anniversary of Apollo ll’s Moon walk included a July 16 Library of Congress exhibition opening attended by only one of the Apollo 11 crew: Michael Collins, pilot of the module that circled the Moon awaiting the return of astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, Jr., from the surface. At the reception, James Webb (head of NASA during Apollo II) said that national interest in the space program had waned during the last decade. Barry Jagoda, former Carter advisor who had headed CBS News coverage of Apollo 11, said “on the way over here I couldn’t help but

compare the difference of the price tag for the energy effort—$142 billion stretched over a 10-year period versus the $20 billion the Apollo program cost us for 10 years.”
The Washington Star said July 19 that all three Apollo 11 astronauts would attend an Air and Space Museum ceremony the evening of July 20; on July 20 it reported that the ceremony had been held at 11 a.m. A Star editorial July 20 asked why the United States had stopped abruptly after taking “our first steps into the universe,” concluding that the United States was reluctant to pay for more space missions; assumed that “Americans had become bored by space voyages”; and now leaned “toward introspection and consumption.” Like the Star editorial, a Tom Wolfe commentary in the July 20 New York Times drew a parallel between the Apollo program and Columbus’s voyages, with support and excitement at the beginning and loss of public interest at the end.
The July 21 New York Times said that the Air and Space Museum ceremony drew “some 2,000 people”; the “engineers and managers and astronauts who made possible” the giant leap for mankind had gathered for a “family reunion . . .When they spoke of the future, they wished it somehow could recapture the spirit of the past they remembered.” Later, the three astronauts took copies of the NASA history, Chariots of Apollo to the White House; President Carter said “We will win energy security for our nation in the same way we won the race to the moon.”
As part of the observance, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Science and Technology held a symposium July 19: “Next Steps for Mankind—The Future in Space.” Moderated by Jules Bergman of ABC News, speakers were Professor Carl Sagan, Cornell University; Dr. Noel Hinners, Air and Space Museum director; and George Jeffs, president of Rockwell International’s aerospace operations. A NASA release had recalled events of the Apollo 11 launch July 16, 1969, and an MSFC release announced a nine-day observance in Alabama, home of the center and its Saturn V that made the mission possible.

July 18: NASA announced it would test a modified U.S. Air Force jet July 20 at DFRC to see if winglets (9-foot airfoil sections) attached to wingtips of a KC-135 could improve performance and save fuel. Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb, LaRC’s inventor-engineer, had had the idea of using normal drag from a wingtip vortex as lift to improve performance. NASA would vary the winglets’ cant angle and incidence between test flights to measure effects of different positions; DFRC had already flown the plane without winglets to obtain baseline measurements for comparison.

July 19: The Library of Congress Science and Technology Division’s NASA support project issued two news alerts, the first on a Soviet “space mini shuttle” like the French project Hermes, reportedly designed to carry five or six crew members (or the equivalent in cargo) to visit and replenish orbital stations. The vehicle would use a normal expendable Soviet rocket for launch and make a gliding reentry into Earth’s atmosphere. The translation pointed out that the Soviet concept differed from the United States reusable Shuttle, more closely resembling the CNES manned hypersonic glider.
The second notice covered government and CNES decisions affecting the scope and timing of Hermes. The French Council of Ministers on March 7 had approved a Hermes launch capability of seven tons to carry a materials-processing program called Minos, using a space transport vehicle like a mini shuttle to bring back products made in the space factories. A Hermes would be launched by the last of five versions of the Ariane vehicle; development of the Hermes and the Ariane 5 would take from seven to eight years. (LC/S&T Alerts 5498, 5499)
July 20: The Washington Star reported that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had voted to let American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and GTE Satellite Corporation, operators of the Comstar satellite system, integrate their domestic communications satellite and ground networks. Before the decision, AT&T could use only ground lines to transmit private line communications. The FCC had put a moratorium on AT&T in 1972 to keep it from cutting circuit costs and further dominating the telecommunications market; since then, the company had been able to use its satellites for some phone service but not for transmission of commercial private-line service. AT&T Comstar craft were currently providing the U.S. mainland with communications to Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
FCC said AT&T would have to file rate schedules if it operated a satellite-only service; the company would integrate the satellites into its “national telephone network,” the Washington Star said. American Satellite Corporation, which already had an operating satellite, wanted the FCC to limit AT&T use of its satellites to services provided through separate subsidiaries; Satellite Business Systems had asked FCC to ensure that AT&T did not fund its satellite services with money from telephone ratepayers.

• Today newspaper said that representatives of Western Union and Hughes Aircraft Company had announced plans to launch Westar 3, an $8.3 million spacecraft bought in 1974 as a ground-based spare to supplement Westar 1 and Westar 2, launched in 1974, and now in orbit over the equator south of Dallas and southwest of San Francisco, respectively. Western Union said Westar 3, needed because of increasing demands on the other two satellites, would be stationed over the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific west of Ecuador. Western Union had made “substantial savings” in buying the spacecraft five years ago when prices were lower: the same item would cost about $14 million if built

July 23: “Once again,” wrote editor Robert Hotz in Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine, “the American public is far ahead of its political leadership” in grasping the significance of NASA’s program of planetary exploration. NASA Headquarters was “astounded by the vast amount of unsolicited public reaction to the Viking and Voyager missions,” in the form of
17,000	letters it received in the first weeks after the Mars pictures reached Earth; the “Voyager flybys of Jupiter.. .have aroused similar public interest.” In Europe and Japan, interest in U.S. planetary exploration was even stronger; media coverage there “far surpasses domestic interest.” Hotz criticized the “penny-wise, pound-foolish policy” that would force NASA to use a single spacecraft for future planetary missions, not the dual-spacecraft approach used through Voyager. “Some day,” he added, “the high price for this folly will be paid in spectacular ‘low cost’ failures.” {AvWk, July 23/79, 9)
July 24: NASA announced plans to demonstrate emergency use of commercial tugboats as auxiliary fireboats, by mounting lightweight firefighting modules on their decks. A program jointly supported by NASA, the DOC’s Maritime Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard had produced the Firefly, a portable fire pump made by Aviation Power Supply Company, Burbank, Calif., after a prototype originated by NASA for Coast Guard use on small patrol craft, based on pumps developed for space liquid propulsion systems.
The Maritime Administration had as a primary mission the improvement of fire protection equipment in ports; studies had shown the need for a small number of modules in custody of the local port authority’s fire service for regular use in emergency firefighting. NASA’s module used an aerospace-type gas turbine to drive a two-stage pump providing 7 meters (22 feet) of suction from the nearest source of water (river, ocean, or lake) for up to four hours on ordinary diesel fuel. Automatic controls offered a continuous range of pressures to emit steam, fog, or foam.
The city of St. Louis, Mo., and the St. Louis Port Authority would work out arrangements for a series of tests, maneuvers, and operations, including public demonstrations of the module in training and simulated emergency situations. The Port Authority and a contractor would compile information for evaluating the concept and would make it available to other port cities. (NASA Release 79-95; MSFC Release 79-77)
July 25: FBIS reported that the Salyut 6 cosmonauts were working on experiments to find out “whether tulips will flower in outer space” (see During May). In five months of scientific research, they had found that plants under weightless conditions generally would develop only to a certain stage: “tulips

produced a nearly half-meter (18 inch) shoot, yet the buds refused to open.” Scientists had decided that weightlessness affected normal plant development at the cellular level. The cosmonauts would try to verify this theory through experiments to lessen “the negative influence of weightlessness” through “artificial gravitation” available in a “biogravistata centrifuge producing acceleration “equal to what we experience on earth,” with a rotating disc containing seed holders in which plants would grow. The station also kept a similar disc without rotation, planted with the same samples, and simultaneous tests were proceeding on the ground. First results showed the shoots produced under artificial gravity were much larger than those in weightlessness. Tass said the tests were “of tremendous importance.” (FBIS, Tass in English, July 25/79)
July 26: NASA reported successful demonstration July 24 of in-flight switch from helicopter mode to airplane mode, by a research aircraft combining features of helicopters and conventional turboprop airplanes. The aircraft, designed and built by Bell Helicopter Textron under a joint program of ARC and the U.S. Army Research & Technology Laboratories, had a 7.5-meter (25-foot)-diameter rotor at each wingtip, each powered by a turboprop engine and capable of pivoting from a straight-up to a straight-ahead position. Oriented up, the rotors would take the craft up or down and hover like a helicopter; rotated forward, the blades would function as propellers, and the craft would fly like an airplane. The demonstration at the Bell plant of conversion from helicopter to airplane mode proceeded gradually, with steady-state flight at each 5° of nacelle rotation; the craft was designed to be much quieter than current helicopters and turboprop planes. The XV-15 craft had logged about 15 flight hours since tests began in April, in preparation for delivery to ARC for a proof-of-concept flight program. (NASA Release 79-98)
July 27: ESA announced that, pending an INMARSAT decision on the configuration of its worldwide maritime space system, member states in the Maritime European Communications Satellite (Marecs) program had agreed at a July 26 meeting in Paris to prefinance a third maritime communications satellite, Marecs-C, under a new arrangement whereby, instead of ESA’s offering INMARSAT the Marecs-A and Marecs-B satellites through Interim European Telecommunications Satellite (Eutelsat), ESA would offer three Marecs satellites directly to INMARSAT. The agreement authorized ESA to sign with the satellite contractor for about 45 MAU (million accounting unit) and begin arranging for a Pacific-area ground station. (ESA Release July 27/79)
July 30: NASA announced that Russell L. (Rusty) Schweikart had resigned to take a position with a State of California commission on energy resources that plans and regulates the state energy system.

July 31: KSC reported that NASA’s third spectacular of the year would come in August-September when Pioneer 11 passed within 13,300 miles of Saturn’s cloudtops. Launched April 5, 1973, the craft would give scientists a first close look at the giant planet with rings and 10 moons. Data from Pioneer 11 would help them plan Saturn flybys in 1980-81 of Voyagers 1 and 2, now headed there after passing Jupiter in March and July this year. The Saturn encounter would be the second planetfall for Pioneer 11, which had used Jupiter’s gravity in 1974 to put it on a trajectory toward Saturn. (KSC Release 142-79)
During July: Aviation Week & Space Technology noted a record number of USSR spacecraft launches in the first six months of 1979 compared to the past year: 49 launches through June, compared with a previous record of 45 in the first half of 1978.

• FBIS carried almost daily reports on Salyut 6 cosmonauts Valery Ryumin and Vladimir Lyakhov, from unloading Progress /beginning July 2 to performance of new metal-combination experiments on the newly installed Kristall furnace at month’s end. Noting that the current crew had broken the previous record of 140 days in space on or about July 14, the Washington Post picked up a Tass report that Valery Ryumin had achieved another space first: he had added a “svelte” 1.5 pounds, first weight gain in orbit. The Soviet press attributed the gain to “space meals” like those on Earth, including about 70 items—‘meat and diary products, confectionery, fruits, juices and spices.” A July 16 story said that the new spaceflight record was “double the overall duration of manned expeditions aboard American Skylab.” Unfolding a 30-footwide radiotelescope antenna made of fine wire petals and pushing it into space was done by July 20, when Progress 7 undocked for reentry.

August 1: As decided earlier in 1979 [see June 30], NASA took the first steps to take ATS 6 out of geostationary orbit and boost it to a higher altitude to keep it from colliding with other spacecraft. On the evening of July 30, NASA fired the minus-pitch attitude-control thruster; the firing was successful, but ATS lost Earth acquisition because of intermittent telemetry problems. In order to reacquire Earth, the spacecraft was put in a Sun-acquisition mode the morning of July 31; boost procedures resumed about 1:30 p.m. and proceeded as planned, with completion expected in about 30 hours.
Since its May 1974 launch, the five-year-old communications satellite had exceeded its planned lifetime by three years, but three of its four stationkeeping thrusters had failed, and the fourth was shaky. GSFC would use the remaining thruster to lift ATS to a level several hundred kilometers higher, where it would remain in orbit indefinitely. (NASA Release 79-81; NASA Dly Actv Rpt Aug 1/79)
•	NASA announced that it would accept on an annual basis applications to become Space Shuttle astronauts; the 1979 time for civilian applications would begin October 1 and end December 1. Successful applicants would report to JSC for a year’s astronaut training, after which NASA would choose pilot and mission-specialist candidates to be assigned by the Astronaut Office to jobs that would continue to train them in their scientific or technical field. NASA now had 27 selectees, including 11 scientists, available as Shuttle crew; 35 more candidates were in training to qualify for selection. The number of candidates to be selected in 1980 would depend on mission requirements. (NASA Release 79-101; JSC Release 79-50)
•	NASA announced that JPL had selected TRW’s Space Systems Division,
Redondo Beach, Calif., to negotiate a contract estimated at $80 million for designing, building, and testing one of two spacecraft to explore the Sun’s polar regions in the 1980s. A second spacecraft would be developed by ESA.
The solar-polar mission sponsored jointly by NASA and ESA would study the Sun, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields in uncharted areas of the solar system.
The four-year mission would begin with launch of both spacecraft by the Space Shuttle in 1983; a gravity-assist flyby of Jupiter in 1986 would put the craft over the solar poles in 1986 and again in 1987. This would be the first mission using spacecraft out of the plane in which Earth and other planets orbit the Sun. JPL would manage the project for NASA’s Office of Space Science. The TRW contract covered the spacecraft system and ground-support equipment, integration of the science payload, tests and launch preparation, and spacecraft-system support during the mission.

• FBIS carried a Tass report that “local monitoring services” had revealed launch of a “carrier rocket” by the People’s Republic of China, “with the aim of putting into orbit an artificial satellite.” The satellite was not orbited because the carrier rocket malfunctioned and “fragments fell on the territory of the PRC,” the dispatch said, adding that this was PRC’s fourth abortive attempt to launch a sputnik.

August 2: ComSatCorp announced that it was considering a system to provide subscription television service directly to homes by satellite. For a monthly fee, the service would offer programming over a number of channels simultaneously, broadcast by satellite to small antennas on subscribers’ roofs. Programming “without commercials” would include first-run movies, sports events, educational and cultural programs, transmissions of data or text, and other formats. Dr. Joseph V. Charyk, chief executive officer of ComSatCorp, said technology for such a system already existed and was being tested in Japan; Canada and the United States had already tried it, and ComSatCorp had demonstrated use of Canada’s CTS satellite with a ComSat-developed antenna. The new service could begin as early as 1983, but would require approval by the FCC. (ComSatCorp Release 79-32)
August 3: NASA reported that LeRC engineers had worked for six years on perfecting a new power transmission system: the Nasvytis multiroller traction drive, capable of transmitting high-power loads at high-speed ratios without using toothed gears. Between 1879 and 1971 about 34 patents had been issued on various fixed-ratio traction-drive concepts; 8 of these were issued to Dr. Algirdis L. Nasvytis. NASA engineers working with Nasvytis had made key design changes in traction-drive roller geometries to produce a test rig that could operate in a 15-to-l speed ratio. LeRC had developed for an automotive gas-turbine engine a similar drive that could transmit 7 horsepower per pound compared to conventional gears with about 4 horsepower per pound.
Stuart H. Loewenthal, lead LeRC engineer on the project, said the “quiet, almost vibrationless means of transmitting power [could aid in] minimizing the noise pollution that now surrounds us.” The device would be cheaper to make because it needed no gear-tooth design or cutting; it was lighter and smaller than conventional gearboxes; it had performed at 95% efficiency for 15-to-l ratios at speeds to 73,000 rpm, and was more reliable, being less susceptible to wear and breakdown.

August 7: NASA reported that the Viking 2 lander cameras had photographed a new layer of frost on the Utopia Planitia site, creating “a scientific puzzle” for researchers. In September 1977, the lander recorded frost on the surface of Mars during its northern winter (one Mars year and almost two Earth years ago); scientists had explained the frost as the result of a major dust storm, during which atmospheric particles picked up moisture that wound up as frost on

•	MSFC reported that it had delivered most of the hardware that would be needed by the first Shuttle mission: main engines, external tank, and solid-fuel rocket boosters. All three main engines had arrived at KSC; two had been installed, and the third was scheduled for next week. The first external propellant tank had been barged to KSC and installed in the VAB to await arrival of Columbia from the processing facility nearby. Flight hardware for two solid-fuel rocket boosters, except for the loaded motor segments, had been delivered to KSC, and the loaded parts were to arrive about September 20. (MSFC Release 79-82)
•	The Washington Star reported that faulty aluminum might have been built into the Space Shuttle and newly constructed military and civilian aircraft. A German aircraft firm, Fokker, had discovered the problem in May; Reynolds Aluminum Company, the manufacturer, told a high-level team of officials from NASA, DOD, and FAA that the plates might have “soft spots” because they were not cooled properly during fabrication.
Walter Williams, NASA chief engineer, said that, until records of the disposition of the faulty aluminum were located, “we have to worry about everything.” The agency suspected that the large external tank (which would carry the Shuttle during blastoff) might contain some of the metal, as might the Shuttle itself, as well as its solid-fuel rocket engines. External-tank strength was crucial because it bore the weight of the liquid-oxygen and liquid-hydrogen fuel under high pressure, as well as the solid-fuel rockets during liftoff. Spokesmen for Reynolds and the Pentagon were “vague about the amount of aluminum involved,” the Star said, but an internal NASA memo said it was about 15 million pounds of aluminum plates. {W Star, Aug 7/79, 1)
August 9: NASA launched Westar 3, the last of three craft built for Western Union by Hughes Aircraft, from ETR at 8:20 p.m. on a Delta into a transfer orbit before going into synchronous orbit at 91-f8-W over the equator south of New Orleans, La. Launch was 53 minutes behind schedule because of two problems: a USAF computer at ETR shut down about 4 minutes before liftoff and took 37 minutes to correct; then, 30 seconds before liftoff, a liquid-oxygen valve door showed open, and several checks were needed to confirm that the door was shut before launch. McDonnell Douglas was to get a million-dollar incentive bonus for 15 straight successful launches.

August 10: Enterprise, the first Space Shuttle orbiter built, began its last trek across the United States from KSC to DFRC, where “its flight log books will be closed,” said the Marshall Star. DFRC said the craft, which served as prototype in all Shuttle tests to date, would be trucked to Rockwell’s Palmdale facility, where parts would be removed for additional testing and possibly used in constructing future orbiters.
Enterprise had made eight captive and five free-flight approach-and-landing tests at DFRC in 1977; it then was ferried to MSFC for ground vibration tests, then to KSC in April this year to check out facilities for handling Columbia, first Shuttle scheduled for launch. JSC Roundup later reported that 750,000 people had crowded airports during the return to California and that Enterprise was a two-day front-page story in area papers at each of the six stopovers and a lead story on television and radio. Donald “Deke” Slayton, now program manager for Shuttle flight-test operations, piloted the T-38 chase plane flying with Enterprise and was spokesman for the Shuttle program during press briefings.

August 11: The Washington Post reported that India's “problem-plagued space program” had suffered another setback August 10 when a seven-story-tall launcher, product of 11 years of work, crashed 5 minutes 15 seconds after liftoff and dropped its payload into the Bay of Bengal 300 miles from the takeoff point. The failure was a real disappointment, following USSR launches of two India satellites, both of which developed serious problems: the first, orbited in April 1975, lost power after a few days. A much more complex satellite launched in June 1979 from a Soviet site would have mapped India’s surface using television cameras to record mineral deposits, water reservoirs, forests, and Himalayan snowcover; the cameras failed to switch on, and scientists got only the data from lesser experiments on oceans.
This launch was India’s first attempt to orbit its own spacecraft on its own launcher from its own site (the small island of Sriharikota north of Madras, whose residents were moved to the mainland as a precaution). Though reporters were not allowed to attend, government cameramen were present. All publicity on India’s space program discussed mineral location and other social uses, but the Washington Post noted the military element: India was trying to join the “club” that included the United States, France, the Soviet Union, China, and Japan; India had lost a border war with China in 1962 and had been at war with Pakistan three times in the past 30 years. A rocket able to orbit a spacecraft could give India intermediate-range ballistic-missile capability; a satellite transmitting television images of mineral resources could also monitor troop movements. The lost booster was a four-stage rocket with solid-propellant motors designed to orbit an 88-pound satellite. The launch had been successful until first-stage burnout; the anomaly had occurred in second-stage flight. (W Post, Aug 11/79, A-13)

• The JSC Roundup carried a report by J.M. Jones, public affairs officer, on the trip to Australia by four MSFC employees acting as a Skylab investigating team to check up on the path of debris over an area 20 miles wide and several hundred miles long. The team left Huntsville, Ala., July 13, two days after the midnight spectacular that occurred as the 77-ton Skylab descended and broke up over the Indian Ocean. NASA needed interviews with eyewitnesses and finders of the fragments to verify the location of the trajectory and the condition and precise location of the debris, and if possible to get samples for examination of the effects on spacecraft materials of more than six years of exposure.
Arriving in Canberra, the team held press conferences to explain the assignment and assure finders that they could keep any fragments they found, which would be returned if submitted for scientific study. At the coastal town of Esperance, local groups similar to U.S. rescue squads had spread the word and gathered about 30 numbered and cataloged specimens laid out in a warehouse for examination; most of them were “apparently really Skylab.” The team expressed appreciation of the local people’s helpfulness. Going inland several hundred miles to the goldfield region where heavier pieces were more probable, the team found the people just as friendly and helpful. When light-plane flights over 30 or 40 miles of uninhabited territory produced no further finds, the team returned with a stop at Canberra to thank officials for the “extraordinary assistance and friendliness” they had met.

August 16: NASA pronounced the mission of international ultraviolet explorer lue successful: observatory performance had “substantially exceeded design and mission objectives.” Gyros used on lue would serve the Space Telescope (ST); the spectrograph and cameras would influence the design of those on the ST; and operational software and guest-observer operations would provide an experience base for the ST.

August 21-24: At a NASA Headquarters press conference on the Pioneer 11 encounter with Saturn expected about September 1, reporters heard predictions of the findings from Dr. Thomas A. Mutch, associate administrator for space science; Fred D. Kochendorfer, program manager for Pioneer Saturn; and Dr. John Wolfe of ARC, project scientist for Pioneer Saturn. A self-styled space exploration buff, Mutch recalled his experience with Viking lander imaging and the delight of a first look at pictures relayed from a planetary mission. Kochendorfer described the Pioneer spacecraft and instruments, explaining how power was obtained at great distances for guidance and transmission, and lauding the Deep Space Network’s remarkable support in getting “absolutely the most we can wring out of this [communications] system.”
Wolfe said that all the experimenters who worked on the mission in 1969 were still alive, and only one had been changed (the principal investigator for

infrared, who had taken a sabbatical). He called the media coverage of the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer II Jupiter encounters in 1973 and 1974 “outstanding.” A plaque in the National Air and Space Museum described Pioneer as “a spacecraft designed to fly by the planets Jupiter and Saturn’—Wolfe congratulated the museum on its forecast. He enumerated the options for imaging, explaining how the Pioneer would approach Saturn and its moons and how the information returned would assist the upcoming Voyager encounters.
A NASA release August 21 said controllers at ARC had ordered a “left turn” for Pioneer 11 to permit one-at-a-time activation of its onboard instruments. Images of Saturn’s rings from 16 million kilometers looked no larger than a penny; by August 26, investigators expected them to be better than any taken from Earth and 20 times better by September 1.

During August: NASA announced selection of a number of investigators and experiments for its missions.
—NASA selected 24 scientists to use data from the laser geodynamics satellite Lageos launched May 4, 1976. Having completed an initial phase of settling into orbit and checking out its laser tracking system, the satellite was now ready to provide mobile and fixed receivers around the world with ranging data on crustal-plate motion, density distribution within the Earth, and polar motion/Earth rotation. The investigators would become part of a working group chaired by Dr. David Smith, Lageos project scientist and were to meet August 29 and 30 at GSFC. Seventeen investigators were from U.S. universities (six), private firms (five), or other government agencies (six); others were from France (four), the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany (one each). (NASA Release 79-102)
—NASA selected 32 research proposals that would use global measurements of the near-Earth magnetic field from Magsat, scheduled for launch in October. The 19 U.S. investigators represented universities (12), private firms (6), and government agencies (1). The 13 foreign investigators were from Canada (4), France and Australia (2 each), and Brazil, India, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom (1 each). The 6-rnonth mission managed by GSFC would remedy shortages and discrepancies in data from many geographic areas. (NASA Release 79-103)
—NASA selected 40 scientific investigations for Spacelab/Shuttle flights scheduled between 1983 and 1985; 33 of those chosen were from the United States, and 7 from other nations (Canada, France, Japan, and Belgium) each funding its own experiments. The studies, chosen from some 200 responses to a request for proposals, would be on astronomy, solar physics, upper-atmosphere physics, space-plasma physics, and high-energy astrophysics.

• August 19 saw the end of the record-breaking flight in the Salyut 6 space station of Soyuz 32 cosmonauts Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin, returned safely in the Soyuz 34 capsule after 175 days in space since launch February 25. FBIS had carried daily reports of their progress. Besides the experiments in materials processing (alloys and coating processes) and the intensive physical routines designed to assist long-term assignments in space, the crew in their last days in orbit had worked with the KRT-10 radiotelescope sent last month by cargo craft and unfurled in space to study extraterrestrial radio sources and nonatmospheric radioastronomy. As early as August 15, they had begun to pack the return capsule with items demonstrating the results of their space stay.
Difficulty with the radiotelescope had presented another challenge to the crew; upon completion April 9 of the scheduled scans, the antenna was to be jettisoned, leaving the docking unit free. “Space sprung another surprise,” Tass reported, when the antenna became entangled with a projection on Salyufs surface. The crew tried to free it by “a minor jerk of the station,” which was not successful. A space walk was already scheduled to check the exterior of the station, dismantle outside scientific equipment, and retrieve samples of materials exposed for a long time to outer space. Ground control wanted to spare the cosmonauts the stress of an extra task in outer space, but the crew insisted it was the only sure way to solve the problem.
On August 15, the crew in “full pressure suits” opened the hatch, and flight engineer Ryumin moved to the attachment point, releasing the 10-meter (30-foot) antenna with pliers, and “imparted the antennae acceleration relative to the station” (in other words, pushed it away toward the Earth for reentry). Then, Ryumin and Lyakhov disassembled and brought in the micrometeorite registration instruments and the panels with samples of structural, optical, insulation, and polymer materials, some of which were in orbit since Salyut 6’s launch in September 1977, others installed by the Soyuz 29 crew in July 1978. Total time of the space walk was 1 hour, 23 minutes: Tass noted that the suits, “fitted out with metal shielding against cosmic radiation and possible concussions” from meteorites, had previously served Kovalenok and Ivanchenkov of Soyuz 29 and Grechko and Romanenko of Soyuz 26. The cosmonauts landed safely August 19 and appeared to be in the best shape yet: they wanted to walk but were not allowed to do so immediately, although they did get brief dips in the hotel swimming pool. Later reports praised the exercise routine for its good effects on the crew, who agreed that even longer flights were possible.

September 1-7: NASA’s Pioneer 11 had encountered Saturn’s bow shock (where the solar wind—a stream of electrified particles from the Sun—bent around Saturn’s magnetic field), project manager Charles Hall reported from ARC, adding that solar storms during the past few days had played havoc with Pioneer’s radio signals. Pioneer was not designed in 1967 to fly to Saturn; that mission arose only after a successful Jupiter flyby in 1974, calling at first for Pioneer to fly through Saturn’s rings on what the Washington Post called a “kamikaze mission.” The most dangerous moment of the 6.5-year 2-million-mile journey would be crossing September 1 through belts of unknown material beyond the ring systems around Saturn that had been visible from Earth, during which Pioneer would risk a potentially fatal collision.
Because of intense radiation (solar-particle interference was degrading the quality of Pioneer images), mission controllers at ARC had reduced the data transmission rate by half. Solar storms had occurred late in July and in midAugust, and high-energy particles from the second storm had reached Saturn at the same time as slower particles from the first storm. Reducing the transmission rate would diminish effects of interference and also the quality of the images. Pioneer would enter the dangerous area outside the visible ring system at 10:44 a.m. EDT, but scientists would not know for 86 minutes whether it had survived (the time the signals needed to reach Earth). No one knew the composition of the 2 minute-wide third ring; if it consisted of boulders, Pioneer could probably get past it safely, but a ring of dust particles could riddle the fast-moving craft and end its career. Project scientist Dr. John Wolfe said chances for survival were half and half; pictures already transmitted by Pioneer were better than any yet taken from Earth telescopes.
The Wbshington Post reported September 1 that solar storms had increased the noise level in space to 10 times normal. In early afternoon, Pioneer had flown into a detectable magnetosphere, showing that Saturn was surrounded by a strong and sizable magnetic field estimated at 700 to 1,000 times the size of Earth’s but roughly equivalent in strength. The New York Times reported September 2 that, as of 12:31 p.m. EDT September 1, Pioneer 11 had survived a hail of fine particles to get within 13,000 miles of Saturn for a 4-hour first encounter. During the approach, scientists were keeping watch on the plane of the visible rings through which Pioneer was descending: Dr. James Van Allen of the University of Iowa was first to note Pioneer’s approach to “dangerous ring debris” in its path. However, the 10:30 a.m. crossing at a speed of 48,000 mph had taken only a second, though ARC had to wait until 2:02 p.m. to learn what had happened; when the radio signals continued past that moment without interruption, “a cheer went up.”

SEPTEMBER 1979
LaRC’s Donald H. Humes said that Pioneer 11 might have had a close call, as the micrometeoroid detector had registered two impacts during the crossing: this was the limit of the instrument’s counting ability, and more impacts might actually have occurred. The impacts apparently caused no damage. The sharp rise in radiation encountered by Pioneer before it flew under the rings had fallen as abruptly as it rose, and by the time Pioneer was under the rings (closer to the planet) the radiation reading had disappeared completely. Dr. John Simpson of the University of Chicago said the rings were big enough to “scour out” nearly all the radiation trapped by the planet’s magnetic field. (The New York Times quoted Dr. Van Allen as saying that the radiation count while Pioneer flew under the rings was even lower than while the spacecraft was sitting on its launching pad at Cape Canaveral, Fla., 6.5 years ago. Saturn’s radiation, although it would be lethal to an unprotected human, posed no hazard to spacecraft, Van Allen added.)
After its close approach, Pioneer swung behind the planet, out of radio contact for 78 minutes, during which its on-board instruments recorded data for later transmission. Upon reemerging, the spacecraft had to cross the ring plane again on its outward journey; the outbound crossing came at 2:32 p.m., and controllers again had to wait for indication that the spacecraft was safe. At 3:55 p.m. the signals affirmed that Pioneer 11 had survived another crossing. This was the last predicted hazard for the spacecraft, which would continue past Saturn to the outer edge of Earth’s solar system and enter interstellar space in 1993, by which time its radio would no longer be audible.
The safe passage meant that Pioneer could spend September 2 and 3 photographing Titan and measuring Saturn’s rings from the dark side of the planet; also, that the two Voyager spacecraft following Pioneer could approach without fear of damage. In its two-hour passage, besides recording impacts, Pioneer had photographed a new ring previously undetected by Earth telescopes, called the F ring: scientists already knew of four rings called A through D (in order of discovery, not location), three of them bright enough to be seen from Earth telescopes, and a fifth (or E) ring had been suspected close to the A ring although Pioneer did not report it. Pioneer had also tracked what might be a new Saturn moon orbiting about 70,000 miles out; some thought it might be a known moon, Janus, but it was in a position indicating that it was an entirely new satellite that would bring Saturn’s count to 11, one short of Jupiter’s 12.
Pioneer 11 photos of Saturn showed dark blue and green stripes across it just below the north pole; the colors, not so vivid from Earth, probably came from sunlight scattering in upper-atmosphere clouds. Jet streams like those seen on Jupiter appeared to whirl around Saturn at speeds of 300 mph. Pioneer images could give a better idea of the dimensions and composition of the rings when compared with Earth-based photographs.
In the six years it had taken to reach Saturn, Pioneer 11 had reported a space-particle strike only once every two months or so, LaRC’s Humes recalled. Once past Saturn, Pioneer was to photograph Titan from about 221,000

miles, record its temperature and atmospheric methane, and try to detect “life chemicals”; as no life was evident on Venus or Mars, this might be the last chance to find extraterrestrial biology in the Earth’s solar system. First images of Titan had shown a fuzzy ball of light indicating a stratospheric layer of orange smog with blue streaks that might denote an atmosphere beneath the smog and clouds. The closest approach at 2:04 p.m. September 2 was 220,000 miles, and Pioneer had taken the first pictures at 260,000 miles. The pictures would be enhanced by computer before scientists could make detailed analysis. On September 3, Pioneer was already more than a million miles from Saturn, relaying no ill effects from the planet’s rings or radiation belts.
Early on the morning of September 2, NASA reported loss of about two hours of Titan data from Pioneer transmissions to the Madrid station; ARC controllers did not know whether the loss occurred between spacecraft and station or between Spain and the control center about 40 miles south of San Francisco. A loss between spacecraft and station would be irretrievable: Pioneer had only the one opportunity for Titan observations after its close approach. It was not sending images at the time, but about 15 minutes of a CalTech infrared sensor’s readings on Titan temperature were lost. The cause might have been electrical storms in space or on Earth, or passage of the signals close to the surface of the Sun on their way to the Earth, any of which would make it difficult or impossible for the Madrid station to lock on to the signals. A dramatic difference in day-night Titan temperatures would suggest a thin atmosphere; a thicker, warmer atmosphere might be more hospitable to life forms.
Project manager Charles Hall reported September 4 that the Titan data loss previously attributed to radiation disturbances was now thought to result from radiofrequency interference by a Soviet satellite. Both Pioneer 11 and three USSR satellites had been operating on a frequency reserved for scientific use. The Soviet Union had twice agreed to shut down during Saturn encounter, and Hall said NASA had “no doubt the Soviets would have acted” if they had been asked; “we did not request them to turn off their satellite on Monday,” U.S. scientists did not realize at first that signals from a recently launched Soviet satellite might interfere with reception of Pioneer data, being “between 100 and 1,000 times stronger than the signals we were receiving from our spacecraft.”
Aerospace Daily said September 6 that the three Soviet satellites that had stopped transmitting September 1-2 for the benefit of Pioneer’s Saturn flyby were early-warning satellites designed to detect U.S. ballistic missile attacks on the Soviet Union. Cosmos 1024, 1109, and 1124 had suspended transmissions September 1 and 2 at NASA’s request; however, no request was made regarding September 3, and Cosmos 1124 had operated as usual. Western analysts questioned, Aerospace Daily noted, “whether the U.S. would suspend communications with any of is early-warning satellites if the Soviets made such a request” during a planetary mission.
Pioneer project officials told a September 6 news briefing that the loss of

Titan data was not the fault of the Soviet satellite, which was broadcasting before but not during the lost transmission. Poor data had resulted from the combination of solar storm and poor transmission from Madrid. Some data had in fact reached ARC, but was so “noisy” as to be useless. Scientists said the moon discovered by Pioneer was inside the orbit of Janus, previously the innermost known satellite of Saturn; the new ring (labeled G) was between the orbits of Rhea and Titan, beyond the rings visible to Earth telescopes.

September 6: NASA reported that an unmanned Soviet Cosmos satellite to be launched in mid-September would carry 13 experiments from the United States along with some from the Soviet Union and other countries, all designed to study effects of weightlessness on physiological processes. ARC would manage the U.S. portion of the project, in which 40 scientists representing 18 U.S. universities and research groups would participate.
Major payload would be 38 white rats and 60 fertile Japanese quail eggs, scheduled to orbit about three weeks. The Soviet Union would make a first attempt to breed rats in space, separating males and females until the second flight day; two control sets of rats on Earth would be housed and fed like those in space, one exposed to stresses such as launch and reentry but not zero gravity. Three U.S. experiments would use material handcarried to Moscow a week before launch and returned to ARC after recovery. (NASA Release 79-114; ARC Release 79-39)
• Neil E. Goldschmidt, nominated as secretary of transportation, told a Senate commerce committee hearing that after confirmation he intended to look into FAA safety policies, the Washington Star reported. FAA was criticized after two major crashes: the collision over San Diego of a small plane and a jetliner that killed 144 persons and the crash of a DC-10 jet near Chicago that killed 273. Sworn in as a recess appointee in August, Goldschmidt would require confirmation to continue in the position. (W Star, Sept 6/79, A-20)
September 10: JSC reported on trials of a Buck Rogers-style maneuvering unit designed for moving about and working outside the Space Shuttle. Officially named Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), the device worn on the back of a spacesuited astronaut would allow movement in the weightlessness of space using nitrogen gas jets to control direction.
Martin Marietta, the manufacturer, had submitted a prototype the previous week for three months of testing on different-sized astronauts (including female candidates) for fit and mechanical performance in use. Astronaut Dr. Bruce McCandless had successfully checked out the unit’s compatibility with the self-contained portable life-support system, wearing a spacesuit and back-

ing into the maneuvering unit as it would be located in the orbiter cargo bay, “like backing into a phone booth with a large knapsack on your back,” KSC would get the first flight unit early in 1980. (JSC Release 79-55)
September 11: NASA declared the International Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE) missions 1, 2, and 3 successful. The international cooperative effort of NASA and ESA, as a joint contribution to an international magnetospheric study, had used three spacecraft (two launched in October 1977, the third in August 1978) to measure Earth’s magnetosphere and the solar wind from widely separate orbits to better understand processes controlling Earth’s near-space environment. Maximum value of ISEE stated in 1977 was simultaneous operation of all three spacecraft for several solar rotations; the mission operations report signed by Harold Glaser, director of the solar terrestrial division, Office of Space Science, on September 5 and by Dr. Thomas A. Mutch, associate administrator for space science, on September 9 declared the mission a success with respect to prelaunch mission objectives. (NASA MOR S-862-77-01/02/03 [postlaunch] Sept 1/79)
• MSFC reported that Industrial Research and Development magazine had chosen the power-factor controller invented by aerospace engineer Frank J. Nola [see A&A 75, May 2] as one of the “100 most significant new technical products marketed in 1978.” Nola’s invention could sense the amount of power required by an electric motor and automatically vary the power to provide only as much as actually needed at a given time. NASA had licensed 26 U.S. firms to produce and market the device; about 30 others had applied for licensing. Results of MSFC tests had indicated that, if all electric typewriters in the United States (for instance) were equipped with the device, the energy saved would equal that generated by 2,000 to 3,000 barrels of oil per day. Nola and other winners would attend an awards banquet September 20 at the Science and Industry Museum in Chicago, which would display the 100 products for a month afterward. (MSFC Release 79-92; Marshall Star, Sept 12/79, 2)
September 13: NASA said it would join the Canadian Department of Communications and France’s CNES in a 15-month demonstration in 1982 of a search-and-rescue system to speed detection and location of distress signals by use of satellites. The three countries would set up ground stations and conduct simulated search-and-rescue. A satellite in polar orbit could cover the globe every 12 hours, listening on the emergency frequencies used by ships and aircraft. Minutes after receiving an alert, ground computers could pinpoint its origin within 20 kilometers (13 miles) and flash it to coordination centers.
Canada would provide transponders, and France receiver-processors, to fly on NOAA satellites in polar orbit; the United States would modify, fit with antennas, integrate, and launch the satellites and develop emergency beacons for ships and aircraft to use with the systems. The parties to the agreement

September 14: NASA announced it would deploy seven laser satellite-tracking systems in the United States and the Pacific Ocean as part of a global network to extend conventional measurements of strain in the Earth’s crust and to seek the causes of earthquakes. The lasers, to be in full operation by October, would work with microwave devices using signals from satellites and radio stars to measure crustal movements and the buildup of strain.
Laser systems using corner-cube reflectors put on the Moon by the United States and the Soviet Union were operating in Texas, Australia, and West Germany; satellite-laser systems were operating in France, Spain, Germany, Greece, Egypt, England, and the Netherlands. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory had laser systems in Peru, Brazil, and eastern Australia. NASA had joined NOAA, the U.S. Geological Survey, NSF, and the Defense Mapping Agency in a program using space technology to reduce earthquake hazards and possibly to develop a capability of predicting them. (NASA Release 79-117)
September 17: In a move “necessary and proper to achieve the objective of national technical superiority through joint action with U.S. domestic concerns,” NASA administrator Dr. Robert A. Frosch announced that the agency would offer industry “equity partnership ventures” in use of the Space Shuttle, NASA technical advice, data, equipment, and facilities for commercial purposes.
NASA had set up guidelines to ease U.S. industry entry into an area that, because of high technology and high economic risk, had traditionally been left to the federal government. Such a government-industry relationship would combine industry’s risk capital and experience with NASA’s resources to ensure U.S. leadership in space processing of materials. Areas of potential commercial interest included semiconductors, infrared and nuclear detectors, metallurgy, microwave devices, and medicine. (NASA Release 79-119)
• ESA announced that the first stage of its Ariane launcher had undergone its last ground qualification test September 13; CNEiS had scheduled the launch phase to begin October 1, with first launch between December 8 and 18. Aerospatiale had shipped the flight-qualification model from Le Havre September 15, bound for the launch site at Kourou, French Guiana. (ESA Release Sept 17/79)
September 19: The Washington Star said that three jet planes in four days had lost large parts while in flight: on September 15, a Boeing 707 passenger jet operated by American Airlines on a flight from Detroit to San Francisco had dropped a wing flap into San Francisco Bay; on September 17, a DC-9 passenger jet of Air Canada, 60 miles north of Boston’s Logan International

Airport en route to Nova Scotia, had dropped is tailcone into the Atlantic Ocean from 25,000 feet up. An American Airlines Boeing cargo jet had scattered 200-pound chunks of its left wing over Chicago September 18 before landing safely at O’Hare airport. No one had reported injuries from falling debris. (W Star, Sept 19/79, A-9)
September 20: NASA launched the high-energy astronomy observatory Heao 3 at 1:28 a.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on an Atlas Centaur into an orbit with 492-kilometer apogee, 477-kilometer perigee, 94.3-minute period, 43.6° inclination. It was third of a series designed to survey the sky for X-ray sources, measure gamma-ray flux, and define the composition of cosmic-ray nuclei.
The first Heao, launched in 1977 with a 6-month design lifetime, measured and mapped X-ray and gamma-ray sources for 17 months, reentering Earth’s atmosphere in March 1979. It had increased the number of known X-ray resources from 350 to 1,500 and had discovered a new black-hole candidate as well as a dust cloud enveloping a supercluster of galaxies. The second, called Einstein, carrying the largest X-ray telescope ever built, was launched November 1978 with a 1-year lifetime to examine in greater detail the findings of Heao 1.
Heao 3 carried a gamma-ray spectrometer and experiments on a cosmic-ray isotopes and heavy cosmic-ray nuclei. Data from the three observations would cast light on the origins of high-energy radiation in space and the formation of elements and of the universe.

• NASA announced that JSC was studying two ways to repair Space Shuttle tiles in orbit, both requiring crew members to go outside the Shuttle. JSC director Christopher Kraft called it “prudent” to be ready for in-orbit repairs, in case the tiles did not come up to specifications in actual fight: the thousands of heat-resistant blocks covering the underparts and sides of the orbiter might be damaged at launch and need patching before reentry.
The first idea, using an extendable boom carrying television cameras and a platform, would relay images of a damaged area into the cockpit and sustain a spacesuited astronaut making external repairs. The other concept would use a jet backpack to maneuver an astronaut around the orbiter to inspect it and make repairs wherever necessary. JSC had three studies under way by General Electric, Martin Marietta, and McDonnell Douglas on repair materials and tools suitable for outer space. (NASA Release 79-120; JSC Release 79-58)
September 24: KSC reported receipt of two experiments that would form part of OSTA 1, first Shuttle payload to fly into space: an imaging radar antenna and an ocean color experiment. The 30-foot by 7-foot imaging radar antenna would test the potential of such a system for geological use in mineral location

and fault mapping; the ocean color experiment would test a technique for mapping concentration of color-producing phytoplankton in the open ocean.
All seven OSTA 1 experiments would have Earth-resources applications. The five others would be an infrared radiometer; a device to measure air pollution (levels of natural and synthetically carbon dioxide) in the orbiter’s flight path; a system of identifying and locating surface features or clouds; a day/night survey of thunderstorm and lightning; and a study of the amount of moisture needed for plant growth in zero gravity. (KSC Release 161-79)
September 26: FBIS reported a Tass announcement that the Soviet Union had launched a geophysical rocket for shortwave solar-radiation research. Vertikal 8 was launched at 6:20 a.m. Moscow time from an unspecified point in European Soviet Union to an altitude of 505 kilometers. At 100 kilometers on the upward trajectory, a high-altitude astrophysical probe carrying instruments from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union separated from the rocket; a recoverable package containing measurement results separated from the probe at 95 kilometers on the downward flight path and launched by parachute. Tass said the participating countries would process the information obtained from the probe. In an interview on Moscow domestic service, a Vertikal experimenter, Academician S.L. Mandelshtam, said some of the equipment was unique and could obtain a television image of the Sun in the shortwave band, which they had never done before. Evaluation of the magnetic tapes had been “a weak point with us,” he said, sometimes requiring a year or two, but must be dealt with in five to seven months because “it is the active year of the sun.” (FBIS, Tass in English, Sept 26/79; Moscow Dom Svc, Sept 26/79)
September 26-October 3: After a two-month delay, a 100-foot high balloon with a crew of four took off Wednesday, September 26, from Tillamook, Oreg., to try a nonstop balloon crossing of the United States. The planned six-day 229-mile trip of the DaVinci TransAmerica carrying 8,488 pounds of gear under 216,000 cubit feet of helium had lasted out continuous westbound instead of eastbound winds, court battles between two major television networks, and investigation by a federal agency, said the Washington Post.
The crew consisted of Vera Simons, German-born artist and balloon pilot from McLean, Va., who had been planning the flight since 1971; Dr. Rudolf J. Engelmann, director of the DaVinci project and an employee of NOAA at Boulder, Colo.; Dr. Fred Hyde, an eye surgeon from Prairie Village, Kans.; and Randy Burch, a cameraman for NBC television. In August ABC television had sued the group to prevent NBC from having exclusive coverage of the flight; the suit was thrown out of court, but Simons said it had upset her and delayed flight preparations.
The flight, originally called a blend of science and art, had lost its science aspect two weeks previously when NOAA reclaimed $28,000 of equipment for measuring air pollutants, ozone levels, and radiation on the cross-country

flight. NOAA said it had acted because “an agency employee” might have sought “personal gain,” and agency lawyers were investigating any illegal conflict of interest. Englemann said he knew of no conflict of interest, calling charges against him “a helluva thing,” according to the Washington Post. The 7-Up Company, which put 100 empty containers on board for distribution after the flight, would cover most of the $250,000 cost. Other sponsors included NBC; Louisiana Pacific, a wood and paper combine whose small balloons DaVinci would drop for finders to exchange for free trees; and camera manufacturer Nikon Inc.
The transparent plastic balloon “larger than the Goodyear blimp” had lifted off at 8:16 a.m. September 26 into strong westerly winds, rising 300 feet per minute and drifting at about 50 mph toward the western slope of the Rockies. Over the Teton mountains of Wyoming the crew had to don oxygen masks and stay 4,000 feet above the peaks, to escape downdrafts that could put the balloon into an irreversible drop. In this “most dangerous” part of the flight, the crew found that its 9-radio system was not working and they could communicate only on a radiotelephone with meteorologists in Massachusetts; they guessed that an antenna on the balloon had snagged in the rigging during launch. The private meteorologists in New England reported that crew members, frequently on oxygen, sounded “strange.. .not as sharp, like having a couple of drinks”; they had postponed discussing plans until the craft descended to lower altitudes. Traveling at between 17,000 and 18,000 feet, DaVinci had gone down to about 10,000 feet over Denver, Colo., but dropped ballast to regain altitude east of that city. More than 500 miles south of their planned route, the crew on Saturday was flying at 1,000 feet over Kansas, having covered more than 1,380 miles in 4 days. Governor John Carlin tried to radio thanks for DaVinci’s visit “even if they didn’t intend to come.”
DaVinci stayed over Kansas for 2 days, about 24 hours behind schedule for an arrival at Norfolk, Va., or Kitty Hawk, N.C. The crew complained of small planes flying close to the balloon: the FA A told them to note the registration numbers so that the agency could “deal with” the offending pilots. (Under federal rules, balloons—lighter-than-air craft—had right of way over all other aircraft.)
The balloon had unexpectedly crossed the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Mo., world headquarters of the 7-Up Company that was major sponsor of the flight; officials had thought the route would be 50 miles north. Air traffic controllers at St. Louis’s Lambert Field (11th busiest in the United States) had diverted airline flights because of the balloon, which had right of way over all other aircraft.
On its stray southward, DaVinci set a new long-distance record for balloon flight over the United States: 1,084 miles at Denver, breaking a 1,058-mile record set in 1924. As it sailed over Kansas and Iowa in a more northerly direction toward its original course, it also passed the 100-hour mark to approach the 137-hour endurance record set by Double Eagle II in August 1978 on its transatlantic crossing. While the crew ate its Sunday dinner over

Nebraska wheatfields, waiting for good winds, they got a call from Boston: Maxie Anderson, the Albuquerque balloonist who had been aboard Double Eagle II on the first transatlantic balloon trip, said “We’re pulling for you.” Nearly six days after takeoff, at 11:56 p.m. Monday, October 2, DaVinci was forced down in a northwest Ohio bean field after a thunderstorm chased it across Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, caught it in the dark (after 11 p.m.), and dumped snow and heavy rain into the gondola. Three of the crew came down safely, but Vera Simons fractured her left leg. DaVinci had not broken Double Eagle II’s endurance record (which would have occurred at 4:23 a.m.), but it had achieved the longest overload wind-borne balloon flight, 2,003 miles, surpassing the nearly 1,897 miles flown 65 years ago by a European balloon.

September 28: NASA announced that it would launch the third applications explorer mission, AEM-C, from Vandenberg Air Force Base on a Scout on or about October 29. Called Magsat (magnetic-field satellite), the craft would map Earth’s magnetic field and record distribution of crustal anomalies with a resolution of 350 kilometers, first global vector measurements of the nearEarth field. Magsat was a cooperative effort of NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, which would use the data to update its magnetic charts. (NASA MOR E-662-79-01 [prelaunch] Sept 28/79)
During September: The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced that the United States and Japan had formally agreed to extend their research and development cooperation into nonenergy fields. A meeting in Tokyo September 20-21 had issued a U.S.-Japan joint communique recalling summit talks in May between President Carter and Prime Minister Ohira on cooperative efforts in basic and applied research; working groups at the September meeting had looked at possible joint projects in areas such as environment, health, and outer space development. Further meetings would be held, the next in Washington. (Executive Office of the President release, no date)
• NASA announced that a special staff of consultants appointed in May 1979 to assess Shuttle management had submitted its report to Deputy Administrator Dr. Alan M. Lovelace. The report contained eight major conclusions (and comments).
1)	When the Shuttle program began, NASA managers took an economical approach to space transportation. Subsequent budgets challenged managers to bring in a difficult technical program with limited funds.
—(NASA originally envisioned a S5.15 billion program, predicting first manned orbital flight in 1978.)
68
SEPTEMBER 1979
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS
2)	Shuttle management had achieved “a commendable level of accomplishment. . .considering fiscal constraints placed upon the program since its inception.”
(Though this report necessarily focused on deficiencies, it noted that Shuttle-program personnel had individually and collectively achieved a great deal in a large and very complex program,)
3)	Shuttle management, in an effort to proceed toward completion even under funding limitations, had set up work schedules demanding more performance than could be delivered.
(This approach had resulted in deferment of some of the planned work each year, as funds required exceeded those available. When critical new work became necessary within a fiscal year, as technical problems came up, even more scheduled work had to be deferred. This resulted in continual planning adjustments that precluded establishment of a stable baseline and led to program inefficiency.
(Example: subcontractor work increased or decreased repeatedly as funding changed in critical areas such as tile manufacturing. Program changes and associated up-and-down expenditure rates had led to termination of experienced contractor and subcontractor personnel, who became unavailable later because of aerospace industry demand. The subsequent employment of inexperienced personnel reduced overall efficiency. The report called this a major cause for concern, especially in the production phase of the program, also, costs due to delays in solving technical problems had increased.)
4)	Long-range planning and status reporting were lacking: emphasis was on the current fiscal year with only secondary attention to work remaining to be done. Near-term planning took so much attention that long-term impact of deferred work was not integrated into the budgets.
(Effective long-range planning requires clear understanding of what has been accomplished, plus accurate prediction of remaining work. Shuttle management faced budgets showing unrealistic costs of its goals, with no effective status-reporting system. Most program planning consisted of constant near-term replanning to count up expenditures in a timely manner, although measuring the work achieved through these expenditures and estimating work still needed were weak. Management tools lacking in some major Shuttle contracts, such as cost reporting integrated with work measurement, were useful but did not provide an automatic solution.
(The only available means of assessing even the partial funding requirements of the Shuttle was an agencywide budget plan called POP [program operating plan] inadequate for program control: it appeared only twice a year and contained little pertinent data between July and March. NASA needed a reliable way—lending itself to independent evaluation—to know program baseline and status, with realistic cost and schedule projections.
69
ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS
SEPTEMBER 1979
Management must overcome the cumulative impact of previous constraints and pressures, while making allowance for the need to rely on contractor input.)
5)	The Shuttle organization functioned well from a technical standpoint but not in the areas of schedule and budget. Organization needed strengthening, and two-way communications needed improvement.
(The original concept of Shuttle organization was a Level 1 program director at NASA Headquarters, a Level 2 [integration] program manager at JSC, and Level 3 separate program offices at the various centers: JSC for the or-biter; MSFC for the main engine, external tank, and solid-fuel rocket booster; and KSC for checkout and launch. Prime contractor support to project offices would be Level 4. Time had altered the concept: the Headquarters Level 1 associate administrator had become the de facto program director, who required the directors of JSC, MSFC, and KSC to take more part in activities reporting to them; responsibility for funding shifted from Level 2 to Level 1. This seemed a feasible arrangement, but the report said “none of the management levels in Rockwell and NASA had a good grasp” of undone work and other items needing completion before shipping Columbia to KSC. Investigators said Level 1 “broad and detailed involvement” with technicalities meant less time for cost and schedule. NASA needed cost awareness “independent of contractor input” and sensitivity to “lower-level cost trends.”)
6)	Schedule changes were no longer a valid way to cope with reduced program or funds; fixed delivery schedules and milestones in the initial operating program not yet achieved required a new management approach.
(Work schedules and budgets must allow for modifications required after the first few Shuttle flights. Users must recognize that initial operations would include development; NASA should make Shuttle users aware of realistic performance and schedule commitments, with priority to successful completion of development.)
7)	Transition to the operational phase remained to be worked out; management should ensure that current organization alignments for Shuttle operations are appropriate. The NASA/DOD interface needed clarification.
(NASA Headquarters managed program operations, with operations offices at JSC, MSFC, and KSC; cooperation between the operations and program offices was evident, but transition from development to operations would need work. Since needs and plans of the DOD user community would affect NASA planning and budget, management to forestall problems should maintain “high-level near-term understanding” of DOD plans.)
8)	The potential was high for unexpected technical problems, schedule slips, and cost growth. All program planning should include appropriate reserves.
(Although the report noted that some parts of a total management-control
70

and information system were in place and functioning well, significant potential for problems would remain until deficiencies cited in the report were corrected.)

•	NASA reported that 28-year employee Dr. James J. Kramer, Headquarters associate administrator for aeronautics and space technology, would retire September 30. In 1951 he had gone to work for the NASA Lewis center where he had managed the quiet-engine project and the 260-inch solid-rocket project and was an aeronautical research scientist. He was manager of the Headquarters refan program office 1971-1973 and directed many Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST) activities before becoming associate administrator in October 1977. (NASA Release 79-123)
•	The Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) Newsreview reported that a NASA-USAF pilotless research vehicle called HiMAT (highly maneuverable aircraft technology) made its first flight at the Edwards Air Force Base test center. Purpose of the HiMAT program was to improve maneuverability of
U.S. fighter craft at transonic speeds (700-780 mph) and in air-to-air combat. No other remotely piloted vehicle or aircraft had the design features used on HiMAT, which would be incorporated into future USAF vehicles if successful: winglets (airfoils at the end of each wing) and unique close-coupled canards (small winglike surfaces located close to the main wings) to reduce air drag, and aeroelastic tailoring that originated in the early 1970s using the directional properties of graphite composites in the wings and canards (representing about 25% of HiMAT’s total weight) to control deformations under aerodynamic loads. The first flight was to test vehicle aerodynamics during separation from the carrier and during approach and landing. Taken to an altitude of 45,000 feet under the right wing of a B-52, HiMAT flew for 22 minutes under control of a NASA research pilot on the ground before landing on skids at a dry lakebed. HiMAT was built by Rockwell International’s North American Aircraft Division under contract to DFRC, using concepts from the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory. (AFSC Newsreview, Sept 79, 6)
•	FBIS continued its reports on the experiences of cosmonauts Vladimir Lyakhov and Valery Ryumin during their 175 days aboard Salyut 6. At a Kremlin ceremony September 8, General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev conferred the titles of heroes of the Soviet Union and the orders of Lenin and Gold Star; Lyakhov also received the title “Pilot Cosmonaut of the USSR.” A September 10 report said that they told a press conference that the most important thing about their flight was not the duration but the volume and diversity

of the research; they also said they looked forward to future “lengthy expeditions.”
Dr. Konstantin Feoktistov told Soviet and foreign journalists of plans for an investigation of Salyut 6, which had been in orbit for two years; future use would depend on results of a check of on-board systems (which would take several months). A postflight talk with Feoktistov and A.S. Yeliseyev reported that the big design difference in Salyut 6 was the change to two docking units plus a new propulsion system, which made the supply service possible and enabled successive crews to occupy the station: “in practical terms, we were limited only by the life of those systems.. .impossible to replace in flight,” Yeliseyev noted.
Salyut 6 saw 17 dockings and 6 refuelings and produced 6 times as much work as previous stations; about 80 flight corrections were performed, and 3 space walks were made. Fourteen cosmonauts had spent more than a year on the station. Without extensive repair and maintenance, “the station would be already defunct,” Feoktistov said. Breakdowns that did not affect the main system were the videotape recorder, some control consoles, and communications equipment that had stopped working. Access to items that had been used on the station had proved important: a harmful-contaminants filter returned from the station exhibited corrosion, and the experts could have spent a long time looking for the answer without having the actual filter to work with.

October 1: Effective this date, Air Force Secretary Dr. Hans Mark announced that the U.S. Air Force would realign its space and missile systems research, development, and acquisition elements, establishing two new organizations in the AFSC: Ballistic Missile Office (BMO) and Space Service Division (SSD). The SSD would assume space-related activities for which SAMSO (the U.S. Air Force space and missile systems organization) had been responsible, realigning operations on the east and west coasts: the Eastern Space and Missile Center (ESMC) would be formed at Patrick Air Force Base, Fla., and the Western Space and Missile Center (WSMC) at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. These centers would report through a Vandenberg unit not yet named. ESMC would include the present Eastern Test Range (ETR), the 6,555th aerospace test group, and 6,550th air base wing. WSMC would include the Western Test Range (WTR) and the 6,595th aerospace test wing. (AFSC Newsreview, Sept 79, 1)
•	ESA reported that the West German firm, Dornier System, leader of the STAR industrial consortium, would be prime contractor for a European spacecraft to participate in the international solar-polar mission (ISPM), a cooperative ESA-NASA project. The contract would cover design, development, manufacture, and testing, at a cost of more than 47MAU (million accounting units, worth U.S. $1.2 in 1979). The ISPM would make measurements outside the ecliptic plane and observations of the Sun using two spacecraft, one each from ESA and NASA, to be launched in February 1983 on the U.S. Space Shuttle. (ESA Release 25)
October 2: Today reported launch of an unannounced classified payload from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base on a Titan 3C at 7:22 a.m. Monday, September 30. The craft was a reconnaissance satellite, military sources said later, and would be used to photograph Soviet troop movements. (Today, Oct 2/79, 8A)
•	NASA reported it would speed up development of the MMU to be built by Martin Marietta for astronaut use in inspecting and repairing Space Shuttle insulating tiles while in orbit. The MMU, an improved version of a gas-jet backpack tested inside the orbiting Skylab in 1973-1974, should be fully developed by next August for the second Shuttle flight in October 1980. NASA would not consider further an alternate method of tile inspection (an extendable platform on a boom with a television camera). (NASA Release 79-125)

October 5: MSFC announced that it had issued requests for proposals to design a 25-kilowatt power system to provide supplemental solar power for long-duration Shuttle missions or support free-flying payloads. In early spring of 1980 NASA would award two or more parallel contracts at $1 million each for studies to be completed within 12 months.
Development would begin in 1982; the system would fly its first mission in 1984-1985 attached to a Shuttle orbiter carrying a Spacelab, to provide additional power and attitude and heat control. The power system on this mission would carry an experiments pallet and would be left in space (after the orbiter completed its mission) to power the long-duration experiments riding on the pallet. Luther E. Powell, MSFC project manager, said the power system would be forerunner of future large systems in space, such as service platforms and other unmanned large space structures.

October 6: FBIS reported that U.S. scientists and engineers visiting tracking stations, research institutes, and “cosmic centers” in the People’s Republic of China had seen their achievements in rockets and cosmonautics. At one center, the Chinese showed their U.S. counterparts the latest “spy in the sky” satellite planned for launch in late 1979. (FBIS, Moscow to Asia in English, Oct 6/79)
October 8: KSC reported another step toward Space Shuttle launch: mating of the first two segments of the solid-fuel rocket motors to aft skirt assemblies. The first major element of the system, the orbiter, was in the KSC processing facility being prepared for launch: the three main engines had been installed, and work was in progress on other items, especially installation of the thermal protection tiles. The second major element, the huge external tank, had been delivered to KSC for checkout before being mated to the rest of the system. The third major element, the two solid-fuel rocket motors that would fire in parallel with the orbiter engines at liftoff, had been built in sections to be assembled at KSC and were designed for reuse after cleaning, refurbishing, and reloading.
Before the first test flight in 1980, the remaining tiles would be installed; orbiter systems checked out; remaining motor segments delivered and stacked; major elements mated on the mobile launch platform; assembly rolled out to the launch pad; and three main engines actually test-fired, in a final systems checkout. (KSC Release 174-79)
October 9: NASA announced creation of a new Headquarters program office called Space Transportation System Operations, headed by an associate administrator not yet appointed, to be responsible for Shuttle operations including scheduling, pricing, launch-service agreements, the Spacelab program, and expendable launch vehicles (except Shuttle upper stages). Dr. Robert A. Frosch said the move would centralize Shuttle services in a user-oriented organization.

October 10: NASA reported a prediction by NORAD that the Pegasus 2 spacecraft assembly launched by NASA in May 1965 would reenter Earth’s atmosphere about November 5. Pegasus 2, one of three satellites launched in 1965 to gather micrometeoroid data for use in designing future spacecraft, weighed considerably less at 10,430 kilograms than the 70,300-kilogram Skylab that reentered over Australia in July. The predicted descent area would be 31.7° north and south of the equator, an area three-fourths water. After the reentry of Pegasus 1 and 3 (September 1978 and August 1969, respectively), no parts of either spacecraft were found or recovered. (NASA Release 79-126)
October 12: FBIS reported completion of the 19-day flight of Cosmos 1129 and recovery of rats, insects, plants, and other items flown on it [see September 6]. Tass said a field laboratory—a huge inflated shed made of several hermetically connected tents—was set up at the landing site so that “morphologists, biochemists, and physiologists” could inspect the samples and do the first research.
Samples then went to the Moscow Institute of Medico-Biological Problems where scientists from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, and the United States would make early estimates of the results obtained. Some of the materials would be sent to laboratories in participating nations. (FBIS, Tass in English, Oct 14/79)
October 15: NASA reported that scientists and engineers from five countries (Australia, Canada, India, Japan, and the United States) had met at WFC to compare techniques of gathering data on ozone in the stratosphere. Instruments in use worldwide had used different techniques of measurement and had never compared for system errors or other biases. The joint effort was sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization, FAA, and NASA.
Over a 14-day period beginning October 21, the group would perform 20 rocket-borne experiments to establish instrument precision and comparability; the resulting information should define ozone variability during the period. Measuring instruments would fly on four kinds of rockets (Orion, Nike Orion, Super Areas, Super Loki) scheduled to coincide with orbiting-satellite passes, to compare rocket measurements with those from the satellites. Ozone data would also come from meteorological rockets and balloons as well as from ground-based equipment. (NASA Release 79-130; WFC Release 79-17)

October 16: NASA reported that pictures taken by Voyager 2 in July during its trip through the planet Jupiter’s system had revealed a new moon in the ring plane. CalTech researchers David Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson, the latter a member of the Voyager imaging-science team, had found a starlike object in pictures of the ring plane taken less then 24 hours before the closest approach to Jupiter. When exhaustive search found no star to account for the trace in the photograph, the searchers examined another higher resolution image showing the same portion of the ring, trails of known stars, and the same unidentified object. The presence of a moon was shown by differing angles and lengths of actual star trails compared with the trail left by the object. Jewitt and Danielson would make a further study of pictures taken four months earlier by Voyager 1 in an effort to identify the same object. (NASA Release 79-132)
•	JSC announced that all Space Shuttle orbiters would have an optical landing aid presently used by pilots of more than 20 U.S. and foreign commercial and military aircraft. Rockwell International, prime contractor for the Shuttle, would provide for the commander and pilot of all orbiters a “head up” system to project instantaneous displays of spacecraft speed, rate of descent, altitude, and other critical flight factors on a transparent viewing glass located above the cockpit window to be pulled down like the sun visor of an automobile. The system would be placed on Columbia in time for the first operational flight, expected early in 1981 after completion of the flight-test program, and in JSC simulators and trainers. (JSC Release 79-64)
October 18: The New York Times said that Dr. Thomas A. Mutch, NASA’s associate administrator for space science, had told a House subcommittee that problems with the Space Shuttle would delay flight of the Galileo mission for two years. NASA now planned to launch the mission in 1984 in two parts: one Shuttle flight would take a Galileo orbiter into Earth orbit for launch toward Jupiter, and another Shuttle flight would take another spacecraft for launch into the atmosphere of Jupiter carrying instruments to record its composition. Earlier mission plans were for a 1982 Shuttle launch carrying a single Galileo package including orbiter and Jupiter probe; the change would add more than $184 million to the cost of the project, previously estimated at about $450 million.
NASA had had problems not only with the Shuttle insulating tiles but also with the rocket engines. An improved engine was to be standard after the first test flights. Angelo Guastaferro, NASA’s head of planetary programs, said that the 4,600-pound Galileo spacecraft would be too heavy for the Shuttle to carry into Earth orbit without the improved engines.

the parties reviewed continuing exchange of information on use of communications satellites; acquiring data from each other’s remote-sensing satellites; flying Japanese scientific instruments on Spacelab launches; mutual use of Japan and ESA tracking stations; and using Spacelab for research in materials and life science. A sixth meeting was set for Tokyo in 1980. (ESA Info Bltn 26)
ESA reported a design review of the Marecs project October 9-10 with the prime contractor, British Aerospace, after which the agency approved a start on satellite assembly so that a flight unit would be ready for launch by the Ariane L04 vehicle. (ESA Info Bltn 27)
October 20: FBIS carried a Tass report that U.S. and USSR scientists had agreed on joint research headed by Moscow University and CalTech on gravitational waves. The agreement covered development of extrasensitive instruments and of laboratories insulated against acoustic and seismic noises, as well as coordinating simultaneous measurements taken at two widely separated laboratories, in Los Angeles and in Moscow. Soviet physicists would use cryogenic electronic devices; the United States would develop laser systems to record small-scale oscillations. (FBIS, Tass in English, Oct 20/79)
October 22: NASA held a press conference on the launch of Magsat, scheduled for the end of the month from the WTR. Pitt Thome, director of space and terrestrial applications, described the mission as an effort to obtain a global picture of Earth’s magnetic field, data previously available mostly from ground or aerial surveys and therefore both fragmentary and unreliable. A series of satellites (POGO) in the 1960s and 1970s had done some magnetic mapping, and this would be the first update of that information, used for navigation and for locating natural resources. Magsat would carry both scalar and vector magnetometers, so that it could measure not only the extent but also the direction of magnetic forces in Earth’s crust. Variations in the data from those in previous studies would also shed light on tectonic plate motion, the constant though small movement of rigid plates forming the Earth’s crust. The project scientist, Dr. Robert A. Langel of GSFC and John Denoyer of the U.S. Geological Survey described potential use of the Magsat data. Denoyer said he had been in southeast Asia recently with officials interested in oil prospecting, who would use the data in the next few years to look for petroleum as well as minerals.

from the launch site; on impact the package tumbled and landed on a rock, knocking a hole in the side of the container and damaging one of the experiments. The payload would be returned to MSFC for disassembly and inspection; two of the experiments would be refurbished and reflown. Investigators should begin forwarding results of SPAR 6 experiments to MSFC within two weeks. (MSFC Release 79-113)
•	NASA reported delivery of a second experimental turbofan engine produced by AVCO Corporation for a program called QCGAT (quiet clean general-aviation turbofan) to LeRC for testing. The program aimed at decreasing noise and exhaust emissions while maintaining or reducing fuel consumption, compared with present general-aviation turbofans. The first engine in the program arrived at LeRC last winter from its designer/builder Garrett AiResearch; results of tests on that engine showed noise reduction of about 10 decibels and emission reduction of 54% for carbon monoxide and 76% for unburned hydrocarbons.
Preliminary AVCO results showed noise-level reduction of at least 14 decibels compared to the quietest business jet now in service, and emission levels even lower than those of the first engine. Noise reduction in the AVCO engine resulted from improved design of internal engine parts (using soundabsorbing materials to muffle noise from fan, compressor, and turbine) and reduced engine-exhaust velocity. LeRC project manager G. Kenneth Sievers said test results from both engines showed “noise need not be a major constraint” on use of turbofan-powered aircraft for general aviation. (NASA Release 79-137)
October 24: NASA reported that Pioneer 11 was working well on its way out of the solar system after a successful flyby of Saturn, during which it found two new rings and possibly a new moon of the planet. Barring a failure, the Pioneer could continue to return useful data until the late 1980s when it would pass beyond radio contact with Earth. The spacecraft was built by TRW Systems Inc., and the project was managed by ARC in California.
After a six-year trip of more than 3.2 billion kilometers (2 billion miles) in space, Pioneer 11 spent 10 days photographing and measuring the ringed planet. The spacecraft experienced at least two hits from meteroids above the rings of Saturn and three more hits below the rings; it recorded no damage from high-velocity ring particles, showing that spacecraft could operate safely near the visible rings. Major findings of the flyby included a magnetic field around Saturn; analysis of the gravity field and composition of the planet’s core; radiation into space of 2.5 times more heat that Saturn received from the Sun; and low temperatures on the moon Titan that might remove the possibility of life there.

October 25: NASA declared the August 9 launch of WESTAR-C (known as Westar 3 in orbit) to be satisfactory. The satellite, third of Western Union Telegraph Company’s communications satellites to be launched by NASA, was performing satisfactorily on its station at 91 °W over the equator.

• MSFC reported cancellation of a Shuttle propulsion-system static test firing October 24 because of a hydrogen leak in the orbiter’s aft compartment near the main engines. Sensors detected hydrogen in the compartment about 10 a.m. during tanking; attempts to isolate the leak continued until 3 p.m. without success. Frank Stewart, MSFC test manager, said the leak apparently came from a 17-inch or smaller hydrogen feed line in the aft compartment. “It is an inert area,” he said, “and if we could have isolated it to one of the lines. . .disconnected after ignition we could have safely fired the engines.”
Since the exact source and cause of the leak could not be established with hydrogen in the system, officials decided to postpone firing, drain the propellants, and give engineers access to the area for additional checking. While isolation checks went on, the countdown continued through fuel loading procedures; several tests of the main propulsion system were conducted, such as inspection for ice and frost on the external tank after the fuel was loaded.
Stewart said the problem had no connection with the main fuel valve leak that started an external fire during a July 2 test. This postponement, he said, should have “very little impact on our target date” for completing main propulsion system tests. (MSFC Release 79-116)
October 29: NASA reported that DFRC in conjunction with the FAA was conducting tests with a Boeing 747 aircraft to generate wake vortices for probing by small instrumented aircraft. The tests, performed both in a simulated approach and in actual approaches and landings, would try to verify optimum spoiler arrangements suggested by wind-tunnel tests.
Wake vortices, normally invisible turbulent airflows that stream in funnel shape from wingtips and flaps of aircraft in flight, could be hazardous to smaller aircraft; for this reason FAA required spacing of 3 to 6 miles between aircraft approaching terminals for landing, to allow time for vortices to break up. However, the spacing had slowed flight operations and added to delays experienced by passengers because of airport congestion. To allow closer spacing of aircraft and reduce delays, NASA had begun using wind-tunnel and

other experimental techniques to study reduction of strength in wake vortices; one method was partial deployment of wing spoilers, normally used to decrease lift after landing. (NASA Release 79-140; DFRC Release 79-38)
•	MSFC announced that NASA would buy from Rocketdyne Division, Rockwell International, 12 more main engines for the Space Shuttle under a $365.7 million amendment of the original 1972 contract that would bring its value to $1,263,215,058. The original contract was for purchase of 27 engines; the amendment would bring the total ordered to 19. The amendment also called for overhaul and test of 10 engines to 109% of rated power level, plus a second overhaul and flight test of the 3 engines being used for propulsion testing.
Rocketdyne had delivered the engines for the first Shuttle flight, three ground-test engines, and a spare flight engine under the original 1972 contract. The three flight engines delivered to KSC had been installed on Columbia for next year’s first spaceflight. (MSFC Release 79-117)
October 30: NASA announced that Space Shuttle flights through early 1984 were almost completely booked up for payloads, with firm commitments for the first 37 operational flights beginning in 1981. The 47 payloads scheduled for those flights belonged to 14 government, commercial, and foreign users and ranged from launches of ESA’s Spacelab to navigation, communications, and weather satellites. NASA payloads would account for 32% of the number; DOD, about 15%; and all other users, about 53%. Payloads normally received assignments on a first-come first-served basis, but missions affecting national security would get priority, as would missions with time-critical launch windows or prime scientific or technical objectives. Flights for which NASA would be fully reimbursed would take precedence over routine scientific or technical launches.
Services available to Shuttle users would include a basic launch with support and options (available at extra cost) such as spiecial hardware, tests, and analysis; use of KSC services and facilities; or special operations such as extravehicular activity or longer duration. In addition to the 47 large payloads designed for the cargo bay, more than 200 organizations and persons had reserved (at a cost of $3 thousand to S10 thousand) space for up to 300 small self-contained payloads called getaway specials (GAS), research-and-development packages weighing 200 pounds or less. (NASA Release 79-142)
•	MSFC reported the successful conclusion October 26 of three separate static-firing tests of the Space Shuttle main engine. The three test engines had completed a scheduled total of 1245 seconds of firing time in less than 12 hours; two engines were tested at NSTL in Mississippi; the other, in California. One of the pair tested in Mississippi fired for 520 seconds, the running time needed for Shuttle launch; the other fired for 665 seconds, the time required for a mission abort. Both these tests were part of a preliminary flight

October 31: NASA announced a short-term research program using the human-powered Gossamer Albatross 2, sister ship of the craft that flew over the English Channel this summer, powered by a pilot pedaling a bicycle-like system to drive the propeller. The study, funded jointly by DFRC and LaRC, would fly a lightweight data system on the aircraft to measure its stability, control, and performance characteristics in human-powered flight; under tow (in propeller-off flight); and under electric-motor in steady-state conditions. NASA would use results of the study in future low-speed lightweight aircraft flying at extreme altitudes. (NASA Release 79-141)
During October: NASA reported personnel actions.
—Dr. Lee R. Scherer, associate administrator for external relations at NASA Headquarters and former director of KSC, received for a second time the agency’s highest honor, the distinguished service medal, from Dr. Robert A. Frosch in a Headquarters ceremony October 4. Scherer previously received NASA’s exceptional service medal and exceptional scientific achievement medal. (KSC Release 169-79)
—L. Michael Weeks, formerly with General Electric, would be deputy associate administrator for Space Transportation Systems Acquisition under John Yardley at Headquarters effective November 5. (NASA Release 79-138; NASA anno Oct 29/79)
—The AP reported the death October 22 of Dr. Hans Gruene, 69, KSC director of launch vehicles from 1964 to his retirement in 1973. Born in Germany, he entered the United States in 1945 with a group headed by Wernher von Braun assigned to launch V-2 rockets captured from the German army. He had come to Cape Canaveral in 1952 to set up a joint long-range proving ground that became the ETR. He had concluded his career with the four Skylab launches in 1973.

November
November 2: NASA announced a new five-year development program to retain U.S. leadership in satellite communications and assigned LeRC to work with private industry, DOD, and other NASA centers to launch a sophisticated communications satellite in 1985 or 1986. Daniel J. Shramo, LeRC director of space applications, explained that NASA in 1973 had “phased down” its work in communications satellite technology because of budget pressures and “the strong capabilities present in the private sector.” Industry since then had been improving antenna performance, increasing the number of circuits per satellite, and decreasing satellite weight per channel. Technical studies already under way at LeRC should result in a communications satellite system capable of transmitting data anywhere regardless of population size or electronic sophistication. (NASA Release 79-143)
November 3: NASA’s public affairs office reported that the 23,000-pound Pegasus 2 satellite reentered the Earth’s atmosphere at about 4:20 p.m. EST, coming down in the Atlantic Ocean northwest of Ascension Island. The “footprint” of descending'debris would have spread over a path 60 miles wide by 1,500 miles long over the South Atlantic, the report said. (Hq PAO, Nov 3/79)
November 5: The Washington Post said NASA’s inspector general and the DOD were investigating charges that Rockwell International’s Space System Group beginning in 1977 had hidden cost overruns by charging expenses to the wrong projects. Work on the USAF’s Navstar satellite was charged to NASA’s Space Shuttle contract, employees alleged, and current costs of Shuttle development were charged to future operations, in violation of government budget rules.
Present and former Rockwell employees had provided company documents to back up their statements. Ray Sena, an employee who had complained to higher management and to NASA officials, was formally suspended by Rockwell. Company officials admitted an investigation was in progress but refused comment. Although NASA learned of the situation in 1977, it only recently admitted that the Shuttle was at least $500 million over budget. (W Post, Nov 5/79, A-2)
• The New York Times said President Carter planned to meet with NASA officials to review Shuttle management and funding. The report said NASA administrator Dr. Robert A. Frosch would ask for more money to prevent further serious delays in Shuttle production and testing. Estimated Shuttle spending for FY81 would be $1 billion. NASA’s original estimate of Shuttle cost was

$5.15 billion in 1971 dollars, to include delivery of two of four of the planned spacecraft; current estimate was $6.1 billion in 1971 dollars, a 20% increase. Rockwell International had delivered only one flight vehicle, now at KSC for preflight checks and installation of insulating tiles. (AT Times, Nov 5/79, A-l)
•	NASA reported that a scheduled 510-second firing of the main Shuttle propulsion system test article’s three-engine cluster at the National Space Technology Laboratories had failed November 4 when a sensor detected excessive pressure in the oxygen pump of the No. 3 engine and shut the test down after 9 seconds. The No. 1 engine was damaged during the cutoff sequence, when a hydrogen line ruptured near the base of the engine nozzle. Extent of the damage was unknown; the engine would be sent to Rockwell’s California plant for inspection and repair.
MSFC and the contractor were investigating the failure and the possibility of replacing the damaged article in the test stand. Impact on Shuttle schedules had not been assessed. Meanwhile, the orb iter Columbia had successfully passed a series of “ hot fire” tests at KSC of the auxiliary power units to steer main-engine nozzles during launch and to drive control surfaces during atmospheric flight. The tests simulated ascent and descent phases of a Shuttle mission. Next milestone for Columbia would be an integrated test of all systems. (NASA Release 79-146; MSFC Release 79-122)
•	NASA declared successful the May 4 launch of FltSatCom 2 from ETR on an Atlas Centaur into a transfer orbit. An apogee kick motor fired May 6 had put the spacecraft into the desired synchronous orbit. All spacecraft systems were operating normally. John F. Yardley declared November 1 that NASA objectives had been accomplished. (NASA MOR M-491-202-79-02 [postlaunch] Nov 5/79)
November 7: NASA announced flight demonstrations of an experimental pilot advisory system for high-density uncontrolled airport environments (where more than half of midair collisions occur). The WFC test program used a computer-generated voice technique to send messages on air-traffic location and headings every 20 seconds, airport advisories every 2 minutes and collision warnings as necessary. (NASA Release 79-145; WFC Release 79-18)
•	NASA reported that, after five years of continuous service, Landsat 2 had begun having difficulty with its on-board attitude-control system November 5 and might have to be retired like Landsat 1 (launched in 1972 and serving until 1977). In that event, Landsat 3 would be the only Earth-resources monitor in orbit until Landsat D’s launch in 1981. Landsat 2’s design life was only one year, but NASA hoped it could supplement Landsat 3 coverage until 1980.

November 8: NASA announced that it and the ESA had asked scientists to propose experiments for an international mission to comets Halley and Tempel 2. The total journey would span four years and cover more than 2.5 billion kilometers (1.6 billion miles). A spacecraft using solar-electricity propulsion engines for the first time in deep space would fly past Halley’s comet in 1985, release an instrumented probe, and proceed to an encounter with Tempel 2 in 1988, flying side by side with it for a year or more on its path around the Sun. Science objectives would be to define the chemical-physical nature of the comets’ nuclei, of the comas, gases, and dust surrounding the nuclei, and of the comets’ tails. As comets differ widely, NASA wanted to make sure of this opportunity to sample two different types. (NASA Release 79-147)
November 9: NASA reported that JPL had awarded a 16-month $1.2 million contract to General Electric’s Space Division for three dish-shaped prototype units 12 meters (40 feet) in diameter with a sun-tracking mechanism, able to produce solar energy for electric power to small communities and rural areas. JPL acted for DOE in the second phase of a program to develop a point-focusing solar concentrator that would give best thermal performance for the lowest cost. (NASA Release 79-149)
• NASA reported that LaRC had developed a microwave device under test at Norfolk General Hospital to destroy cancerous tissue by heating tumor cells. Used outside the body and emitting no radiation, the device had already demonstrated that it could locate tumors in 14 known cancer patients and in one patient had found a cancerous site undiscovered by conventional means. The applicator could sense cancerous tissues, hotter than normal tissue, much deeper in the body than could infrared thermography, limited to finding tumors near the body surface. (NASA Release 79-150)
November 11: FBIS carried a story from Tokyo Kyodo in English that a Japanese fact-finding mission to the People’s Republic of China cited as evidence of the PRC’s “superior space technology” its CSSX-4 rocket fueled by liquefied oxygen and hydrogen, able to carry up to 700 kilograms; Japan’s latest could carry only about 130 kilograms. As vehicle for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the CSSX-4 could take a 3-megaton nuclear warhead more than 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles), in range of both the United States and the Soviet Union. The three-stage rocket, 43 meters long, and 3.3 meters in diameter, reportedly weighed about 200 tons. (FBIS, Kyodo in English, Nov 11/79)

a sensor detected overpressure in a turbopump and rupture of a hydrogen line damaged one of the engines. Upcoming tests would use a stub nozzle like those used in successful ground tests conducted since April 1978; other tests with flight nozzles would be scheduled later. (NASA Release 79-153)
November 18: The Washington Post reported that five states were vying for the Large Space Telescope “even though it will be 300 miles above everybody’s head.” The actual bone of contention was the science institute that would direct use of the unique orbiting observatory. One astronomer said the location of the institute would be “the astronomical capital of the world” for the next 30 years; it was “the biggest astronomical prize to come along since the 200-inch was built at Palomar for the Hale Observatory.”
The five competing states were Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois, Colorado, and California (the University of Arizona and University of New Mexico, where numerous ground-based telescopes were already located, were considered “occasional” contenders). Competition for the institute was so serious that three of the competing groups represented 74 universities: the University Research Association (URA), with 53; Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), with 7; and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), with 14. URA backed the Fermilab outside Chicago; AUI wanted it at Princeton; AURA wanted it at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Princeton boasted of Einstein’s work there for over 20 years. Hopkins said that it had been doing spaceborne astronomy for 20 years and was closer to Washington and to GSFC, which would track and control the Space Telescope. NASA said it would not decide for a year; the Washington Post said that nobody at the agency would talk about it. (W Post, Nov 18/79, A-4)
November 19: NASA reported that failure of a hydrogen line on the nozzle of a Shuttle engine being tested November 4 resulted from use of improper welding wire that “severely decreased the strength of the weld” on a segment of hydrogen line near the base of the nozzle. Rupture of the line caused an oxygen-rich combustion that damaged the test engine. Investigators from MSFC and Rockwell would check all similar welds, using an oxalic-acid etch to identify the weak welds and would decide what remedial steps to take. (NASA Release 79-157)
November 20: President Carter designated the NOAA to manage all civilian remote sensing from space. A space policy review committee chaired by Frank Press had assessed future U.S. civilian remote sensing requirements and decided that a single agency could best handle operational satellite activities. NOAA had managed three generations of weather satellites to prepare it for responsibilities in land remote sensing as well as atmosphere and ocean. The directive said the United States would continue to supply Landsat data to foreign users; the DOC would foster private-sector involvement in remote sensing and would coordinate and regulate civil remote sensing through a board

Orbit had 351.9-kilometer apogee, 578.4-kilometer perigee, 93.9-minute period. The sensor boom deployed November 1, and star cameras were turned on November 2. Magnetic-field data analysis that began November 3 already showed substantial differences from 1970s measurements. Cesium cells on the scalar magnetometer exhibited random interference, but the 60% of scalar data unaffected was enough to fulfill mission objectives. (NASA MOR E-662-79-01 [postlaunch] Nov 20/79)
November 23: FBIS reported from Tass that Soviet scientists had found no pathological changes in animals that underwent weightlessness on biosat Cosmos 1129 September 25-October 14. The animals in orbit gained as much weight as others of their species in the control group on the ground. Lack of gravity was also no obstacle to the development of embryos. The tests established that weightlessness had no effect on formation of seeds and flowers; plants bloomed in space, and their seeds were obtained later on the ground. Observation of biological material flown on Cosmos 1129 was continuing at the Moscow Institute of Medico-Biological Problems, with scientists of France and the United States participating.

November 27: ESA announced that it had scheduled the first test flight of its Ariane launcher for December 15 from Kourou, French Guiana. Firing of an Eridan sounding rocket November 14 had confirmed operational status of the launch base and downrange stations in Brazil and on Ascension Island. (ESA Info Bltn 32)
November 28: NASA said the launch of a FltSatCom scheduled for December 4 had been postponed to January 1980. A leak in the Atlas vehicle’s high-pressure pneumatics system detected during routine testing November 26 was traced to a cracked sleeve and nut assembly; defective parts were removed and replaced. Analysis of the sleeve showed that it had been made from stainless steel that did not meet specifications; NASA immediately began investigating all similar sleeves on the launch vehicle and made changes as necessary. Investigation revealed that the problem was more serious: other sleeves located in stock did not meet specifications, and NASA now planned to check all appropriate fittings on the launch vehicle. (NASA Release 79-163)
November 30: NASA set June 30, 1980, as the date of the first Shuttle launch, depending on several milestones: Columbia rollout from the orbiter-processing facility to the vertical-assembly building in late March 1980;

rollout of the complete Shuttle stack (orbiter, solid-fuel rocket boosters, and external tank) from the VAB to launch pad 39A in mid-April; and a flight-readiness (20-seeond) firing of the Shuttle’s main engine on the launch pad in mid-May. Also needed to make this schedule was certification of the Shuttle main engine by June 30, 1980. Administrator Dr. Robert A. Frosch said that “some time in August or September” would be a much more likely date as unforeseen problems could delay the launch. NASA planned nine unmanned launches in 1980, eight of them reimbursable by other organizations. (NASA Release 79-162)
During November: NASA announced appointment effective immediately of Glynn S. Lunney, manager of JSC’s Shuttle payload and integration development program, as acting associate administrator for STS operations at Headquarters. Lunney would set up the new office that resulted from NASA’s decision to separate STS acquisition from operations, reporting to Deputy Administrator Dr. Alan M. Lovelace. Lunney had been with NASA since 1959, serving at LeRC and LaRC and going to Houston when the MSFC was created. There, he was technical director of the Apollo-Soyuz test project 1972-1975 and was deputy associate administrator for space flight at Headquarters before taking the position at JSC in August 1977.

—NASA announced'appointment of A. Thomas Young as director of GSFC, succeeding Dr. Robert Cooper, who left government service in June. Young, deputy director of ARC since February 1979, had been with NASA since 1961 and had worked at LaRC as mission director for the Viking mission to Mars and mission-definition manager for the lunar orbiter project. Before assignment to ARC, he had headed the Headquarters Office of Space Sciences planetary program. (NASA Release 79-164; NASA anno Nov 30/79)
—NASA announced that John W. Boyd, on detail as deputy director of DFRC since January 1, would return January 1, 1980, to his post as associate director of ARC. He had begun working at ARC in 1949 as an aeronautical engineer, becoming research assistant to the director of ARC in 1966 and deputy director for aeronautics and flight systems in 1970, serving in that position until his detail to DFRC. He was named associate director of ARC in July 1979. (NASA anno Nov 19/79)

• The Washington Post reported the death November 17 of Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky, 84, Russian-born author and scholar “whose theories of cosmic evolution unleashed decades of scientific controversy.” He had come to the United States in 1939 and had done the research for his book Worlds in Collision (1950) at Columbia University Library in New York. His ideas in this and other books were widely denounced, but evidence gathered later by deep space probes appeared to bear out some of his predictions. When Worlds in Collision had its 72nd printing in 1974, Velikovsky said he looked forward to ultimate vindication: “I have been proven correct too many times,” he added. A Washington Star editorial said that, “however farfetched his theories, he arrived at them honestly and stood by them courageously.” (W Post, Nov 19/79, B-7; W Star, Nov 21/79, A-8)

December 3: The ESA reported from its November 29 meeting that British Aerospace, chosen as prime contractor for ESA’s Large Satellite, would receive a contract for the first part of a study phase. Contracts for payload studies would go to Selenia (Italy) for a television broadcast payload and a 20-30 GHz transponder payload; to BTM (Belgium) for a 20-30 GHz beacon payload; to United Kingdoms Marconi Space and Defense Systems for a specialized-services payload; and to Marconi with Telespazio (Italy) and Philips (Netherlands) for mission studies related to the 20-30 GHz transponder. Contractor work would be done by April 1980, with launch scheduled for early 1984.
Objectives of the Large Satellite program were to build a multipurpose space platform to match user requirements in telecommunications and to demonstrate a service payload that would advance ESA technology, assess potential of new satellite services, and promote satellite usage. (ESA Info Bltn 33)
ESA reported that Meteosat 1 had put itself into standby mode November 24, one day after its second anniversary of successful operation in orbit, because of an apparent power overload. Attempts to switch it back to full operating mode succeeded only briefly. ESA had begun a step-by-step unit switching to detect the area of failure and isolate it; the fault apparently occurred in the electronics that turned off the main power supply in case of overload.
Periodic instability had appeared in this protection unit, but the data collection function was fully operational and Meteosat 1 was able to collect and relay data from meteorological platforms within its field of view. ESA was analyzing the problem for possible effect on Meteosat 2, scheduled for launch in September 1980. (ESA Info Bltn 34)
December 4: Rockwell International said that its Autonetics Strategic Systems Division would develop an airborne imaging-sensor autoprocessor under a $1 million contract with the U.S. Air Force Avionics Laboratory covering design, fabrication, and testing. The device would automate functions such as target recognition and cueing for sensors such as the forward-looking infrared sensor (FLIR) used in tactical fighters for air-to-ground combat. (Rockwell Release ESG 19)
December 5: The Washington Post reported that the Air Force had taken an “unusual step” December 4 in formally defending the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine powering the F-15 and F-16 fighter planes. Robert J. Hermann, assistant

secretary for research, said the U.S. Air Force had no plans to use another engine because of F100 problems. Conceding that F100 engine durability was “less than anticipated,” Hermann said F-15 engine-related safety was better than that of any Air Force fighter after comparable service.
On November 21, the head of the USAF Systems Command told the Senate Armed Services Committee that “as many as 43” F-15s and F-16s would be without engines by next summer because of F100 production delays and other problems; at Congress’s insistence, the Pentagon had financed limited work on General Electric’s F101X engine as a possible alternative. Pratt & Whitney and General Electric were competing “hotly” for flight-engine contracts, the Washington Post said, and Pratt & Whitney had announced plans to spend $10 million on expansion of its jet production capabilities.

December 6: Gen. Lew Allen, Jr., U.S. Air Force chief of staff, told the annual meeting of the Military Operations Research Society that the priority of the Space Shuttle program had “shifted to matters of national defense,” the Santa Barbara News Press reported [see October 30]. Whatever else the Shuttle does and whatever other purposes it will have, “the priority, the emphasis, and the driving momentum now has to be those satellite systems which are important to national security,” said Allen, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Emphasizing the “change from what had been true a year or so ago,” Allen said the change was “apparent and accepted now, and it’s a change which will, if there are additional technical difficulties..., become more and more significant.” The Shuttle, he said, was “quite critical for concerns of national defense and for.. .verification of treaties.. .Confidence in the Shuttle and its reliability must be sufficiently high for us to place what is a substantial amount of the security of the nation on the performance of that system.” (Santa Barbara News Press, Dec 6/79, 14)
• NASA reported that researchers from JPL and the U.S. Geological Survey had carried out measurements using radio noise from distant quasars that indicated rapid increase in southern California’s width.
Dr. Arthur E. Niell of JPL’s astronomical radio-interferometric Earth-survey team reported an increase of 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) over 7 months between JPL and NASA’s Goldstone deep-space station about 193 kilometers (120 miles) away. At the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, Niell and J.C. Savage of the U.S. Geologicid Survey described making simultaneous recordings at the two radiotelescopes of radio noise from quasars and comparing the signals’ time of arrival using extremely precise clocks. Changes in distance between the telescopies could be measured with accuracies of 5 centimeters (2 inches) or less, and could be important to the Survey’s earthquake prediction mission.

•	NASA reported results of a 22-month government-industry study of possible damage to electrical equipment from release of carbon fibers in fires after accidents to civil aircraft. R. R. Heldenfels, LaRC director for structure, told a conference at LaRC that public risk from use of carbon fibers on civil aircraft was so small as to be insignificant.
The President in July 1977 had directed the Office of Science and Technology Policy to study potential problems of using carbon-composite materials and to provide a plan for federal action if needed. NASA got the assignment to assess risks of such use in civil aviation, with support from the National Bureau of Standards, some DOD laboratories, and private firms. Other federal agencies studying the problem were DOC, DOT, DOE, and EPA.
The perceived risk was that breakdown of composite materials in burning would put into the atmosphere short lengths of carbon fiber thought to be hazardous to electrical equipment because of their high heat resistance and electrical conductivity; their extreme light weight would allow them to float for miles before touching electrical equipment, causing short circuits or malfunctions. (NASA Release 79-171; LaRC Release 79-85)
•	NASA announced that it had selected 33 scientific investigations for 4 satellite missions scheduled for launch in 1982-1985. The investigations, 23 from the United States and 10 from 6 other nations, would be in climate and upper-atmosphere research. The 23 U.S. investigations represented 11 universities, 1 private organization, and 2 government agencies. Foreign countries represented were Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Each country would fund its own investigations; the cost of the U.S. studies would be about $5 million over the next five years, including instruments. Spacecraft used would be the earth radiation-budget satellite, two polar-orbiting NOAA metesats, and Spacelab 3. (NASA Release 79-165)
December 11: The Washington Post reported that technicians at Cape Canaveral had lost touch with Satcom 3 December 10 after firing a small engine at 1:57 p.m. to put it on station over the Pacific. RCA spokesman John Williamson said that no one knew what had happened and “there is certainly cause for dismay.” Launched December 6, the 1-ton communications satellite designed for television and telephone relay was in a temporary elliptical orbit at the time of loss. (W Post, Dec 11/79, A-6)
—On CBS Evening News, Walter Cronkite and Charles Osgood broadcast a “Night Before Christmas” parody on the loss of Satcom 3, concluding with, “And from somewhere in space comes the seasonal call: Merry Christmas. Good night. And you can’t win ‘em all.” (Text, Dec 11/79)
—The Washington Post December 12 ran a feature story about cable television companies that planned to use Satcom 3 for alternative programming, such as Ted Turner who wanted a 24-hour news “superstation” (channel

NASA had charged RCA $19.9 million to launch Satcom 3, most of it already paid, but RCA. had insured the spacecraft with Lloyds for more than its $50 million market value. (W Post, Dec 12/79, C-l)
•	JSC said that Columbia, first Shuttle orbiter, would undergo a first major simulated-flight all-systems test on or about December 15 at KSC. Astronauts and ground-support teams would conduct a 24-hour 5-day critical operations test including five launch-and-ascent flight profiles; on-orbit operations; and one entry simulation. John W. Young and Robert Crippen, crew members for the first flight, would take part in the test along with the backup crew, Joe Engle and Richard Truly. First actual launch was scheduled for June 30, 1980. (JSC Release 79-73; KSC Release 246-79)
•	NASA adjudged the mission of Heao 2 successful. Launched November 13, 1978, the observatory had made more than 5,000 discrete observations and had worked well for more than 11 months, though design lifetime was only 9 months.
On the basis of significant new findings (X-ray detection of more than 60 known quasars and discovery of more than a dozen previously unknown; the absence of hot neutron stars at the center of historic supernovas, calling for new theories to explain the remnant cores; X-ray emissions far more intense than predicted from main-sequence stars) and of “an active and enthusiastic guest observer program,” Dr. Thomas Mutch, associate administrator for space science, recommended extension of the mission. (NASA MOR [postlaunch] S-832-78-02)
December 12: NASA announced that it would ask scientists to propose experiments for a satellite-measurements program called OPEN (origins of plasmas in Earth’s neighborhood) that would attempt for the first time to explain collective behavior of components of the geospace system: the interplanetary medium near Earth, magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper atmosphere.
Previous programs detected extensive interaction among all geospace components. The new mission would use a minimum of four spacecraft in widely different orbits in key regions of space for measurement and remote sensing of electromagnetic radiation, fields and particles, and plasmas (electrified matter) and defining the flow of mass, momentum, and energy through the solar wind and electrified environment near Earth. Launched during a year in the mid-1980s by the Shuttle, each spacecraft would be capable of significant orbit changes over a four-year lifetime to permit observing a vast volume of space. GSFC would manage the project. (NASA Release 79-173)

•	INTELSAT reported that it would turn off Intelsat 3 F-3 this date after 10 years of service that gave the organization the first truly global telecommunications system. The Intelsat 3 series of nine communications satellites was built by TRW Systems Inc., three of them having failed to orbit or destroyed at launch; Intelsat 3 F-3 was the last of the series in operation. Original design life was five years.
Launched into synchronous orbit in February 1969, the communications satellite operated over the Indian Ocean until July 1972, carrying among others a worldwide telecast of Prince Charles’s investiture as Prince of Wales. It was placed on standby in May 1977, and its mechanically despun antenna stalled in April 1979, more than 10 years after launch, rendering it inoperable. As it had enough fuel remaining to push it 4,000 to 5,000 kilometers further out into space, INTELSAT would turn off spacecraft electronic systems and activate small propulsion motors to put it where it would need 4 to 5 million years to return to its old altitude, drifting at the rate of a meter a year. (INTELSAT Release 79-28-1)
December 14: NASA announced that it had lost contact with Voyager 1 late December 13 after a maneuver to refine its path to Saturn. Launched in September 1977, Voyager 1 was now 996 million kilometers (660 million miles) from Earth, heading for encounter with Saturn in November 1980. The maneuver, commanding the spacecraft to turn and fire its thrusters, should automatically orient the antenna toward Earth; the maneuver occurred, but the alignment was faulty. The agency said it had had previous problems with orientation.
Several hours later on December 13, controllers at JPL acquired a faint intermittent signal confirming that Voyager 1 had received and executed the initial command signals to switch to the low-gain antenna and put it into a twoway mode. JPL would now try to analyze the difficulty and correct alignment without wasting attitude-control gas. (NASA Release 79-180)
•	NASA announced that its manned oblique-wing research aircraft would make its first flight December 19 at DFRC with pilot Tom McMurtry at the controls. The AD-1 (so named for Ames and Dryden centers) would use a pivoting wing to reduce noise and fuel consumption. Studies at ARC indicated that such planes flying at 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) per hour would use

half as much fuel as conventional swept-wing aircraft. Built by Ames Industrial Co., Bohemia, N.Y., the 907-kilogram (2,000-pound) aircraft was about 12.2 meters (40 feet) long with a wingspan of 9.7 meters (32 feet), and was powered by two small 99.8-kilogram (220-pound) thrust turbojets.

•	NASA announced award of a $4.7 million contract to Goodyear Aerospace Corp., Akron, Ohio, for fabricating a high-speed image-processing computer (called massively parallel processor) to analyze data from future Earth-observation spacecraft. Current computers had to process one at a time the thousands of picture elements (pixels) constituting a satellite image, a timeconsuming and expensive procedure. The new computer would use 16,384 simple interconnected elements to process the pixels simultaneously, 10 to 100 times faster than now possible and at a greatly reduced cost. Scheduled for delivery to GSFC in 1982, it would process data in the hundreds of images received there from NASA’s Earth-resources spacecraft. (NASA Release 79-181)
•	The Washington Star reported on RCA’s plans to launch within 18 months a replacement for the $20 million Satcom 3 that vanished from orbit December 10. The company said that it wanted FCC authority to launch a spare satellite now being built; a complete search for the missing communications satellite could take several weeks, but so far “contact has not been regained.” (W Star, Dec 15/79, C-8)
December 17: The Washington Star reported that NASA had reestablished radio contact with Voyager 1 speeding toward Saturn after the spacecraft apparently became disoriented December 13 during a commanded course correction and aimed its antenna in the wrong direction. JPL controllers had managed to make it “reorient itself and aim its antenna directly at earth.” (W Star, Dec 17/79, A-4)
The press reported that a 14-hour dry-run test of Space Shuttle orbiter Columbia got under way at Cape Canaveral December 16 after a day’s delay for routine checks.

the Earth-orbiting Salyut 6 station. Tass said the launch at 1530 Moscow time December 16 put the Soyuz T into an orbit with 232-kilometer apogee, 201-kilometer perigee, 88.6-minute period, and 51.6-f8- inclination. Tass reported linkup with Salyut 6 December 19, the station’s 16th docking with another spacecraft in its 26-month flight.
Dr. Konstantin Feoktistov said Soyuz T would test a new propulsion unit combining former autonomous systems for orientation, orbit correction, and docking, and new life-support, flight-control, and descent systems. Other new on-board systems included radiocommunications, orientation, movement control, and a computer complex to handle maneuvers, systems control, and transmission of processed data. {W Post, Dec 17/79; FBIS, Tass in English, Dec 16-19/79)
December 18: NASA reported successful completion December 17 at NSTL in Mississippi of a full-duration 9-minute 10-second run of the Space Shuttle main-engine test article, a time longer than that needed to launch an actual Shuttle into orbit. This was the first time the whole system was operated for full duration. No problems occurred, and MSFC test managers said that all goals were achieved.
The test article consisted of a cluster of three main engines mounted in a simulated orbiter aft section, drawing propellants from a flight-type external tank. The three engines were throttled back from 100% rated power level to 90%, 80%, and 70%; engine gimbaling and pulsing were successful. To check out two-engine performance, one engine was cut off early as planned, and the remaining two were operated at 70% rated power level for the last 5 seconds of testing. (NASA Release 79-178; MSFC Release 79-133)
December 19: Continuing flight tests of the orbiter Columbia were halted December 18 after two technical failures. Simulated liftoff occurred at 4:30 p.m. EDT with backup crew members Joe Engle and Richard Truly in the cockpit, but two minutes later they failed to receive signals of the simulated separation of the solid-fuel rocket boosters; 8 minutes 50 seconds into the flight, they foiled to receive a signal showing successful separation of the external tank. (W Star, Dec 19/79, A-4)
• ESA announced that a halt in Ariane’s launch sequence December 15 resulted from a faulty sensing of operating pressure in one of the four engines that inhibited the release command. The engines functioned normally, and liftoff would have proceeded normally except for the erroneous reading. After detailed checks of the launcher and launch pad, subject to satisfactory reports, ESA said the launch countdown would resume December 22 for launch December 23. (ESA Info Bltn 39)
December 20: The Washington Post said the empty Soviet spacecraft that linked up December 19 with Salyut 6 was probably a three-person version of the

December 24: ESA announced the successful launch of its Ariane LOl at 17 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds GMT from Kourou; all three stages functioned normally and the fairing was jettisoned as planned. Achieved orbit was close to planned orbit. Space center facilities and all downrange stations functioned “faultlessly” and permitted continuous tracking of launcher telemetry. (ESA Info Bltn 41)
December 27: NASA said that it would stop acquiring Goes 3 data after February 1980; on July 1 it had shut down the altimeter, primary experiment device. DOD would use the C-band transponders to calibrate tracking and would monitor and control Goes 3 after March 1, 1980. (NASA MOR E-855-75-01 [postlaunch] Dec 27/79)
