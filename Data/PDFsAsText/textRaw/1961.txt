  A chronicle of scientific and technological events in the exploration
of space offers useful perspective. To those of us engaged in these
activities, it provides an inventory of the crowded kaleidoscope of
swift-moving domestic and foreign events. To others interested in
space exploration, it helps provide a sense of pace and a clearer aware-
ness of genuine achievements as well as greater things to come.
   Events of 1961 are mingled with the past and the future. The
groundwork of this yearâ€™s milestones was laid several years ago. The
scientific discoveries of Explorers IX, X, and X I I ; the suborbital
Mercury flights of Alan B. Shepard and Virgil I. Grissom; the attain-
ment of neardesign speed (mach 6) and altitude (50 miles) of the
X-15 rocket research airplane; the impact of Tiros satellites on global
weather forecastin ;and the successful f h t flight of the Saturn booster
                     P
for large space pay oads of the future-these were among the highlights
of 1961. The decisions and programs undertaken this year will come
to fruition in the months and years ahead.
   The national character of the space program is evidenced in the
contributions by American industry, the scientific community, the
military services, and other Government agencies. Growing public
recognition of the value of increased scientific knowled e and the
                                                            f
ultimate benefits for society of the total space effort was a so evident.
Known and unpredictable promises of tomorrow spur everyone ahead
in attaining the high oals of the national space pro
   As our broad-basecf scientific program and the g z o p m e n t of a
space transportation technology underwrote the events of 1961, I t was
also the year in which man himself first flew in space. Such was a
thrilling reminder that the best interests of all mankind must ever
provide the purpose and application of space exploration.

   This chronology represents but a first step in the historical process
of fully recording and explaining the myriad activities, accomplish-
ments, and problems of the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration in the exploration and exploitation of space for the benefit of
all mankind. It, was prepared from open public sources. Since
science and technology are fundamentally indivisible, events of
space-related efforts by other governmental agencies including the
Department of Defense, as well as international itcms of a non-NASA
character, have been included to help provide the fuller context of
current history. We are appreciative of the generous help of NASA
offices and centers and interested members of the historical com-
munity.

    manned space flight, the reliability of complex booster capsule
    escape and life support components of the Mercury system is now
    being tested to assure a safe manned ballistic flight into space, and
    hopefully a manned orbital flight in calendar year 1961. Further
    test and experimentation will be necessary to establish if there are
    any valid scientific reasons for extending manned space flight
    beyond the Mercury program.â€

4      AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1961

January SO: President Kennedy stated in his state of the Union
    address to Congress: â€œThis administration intends to explore
    promptly all possible areas of cooperation with the Soviet Union
    and other nations â€˜to invoke the wonders of science instead of its
    terrors.â€™ Specifically, I now invite all nations-including      the
    Soviet Union-to join with us in developing a weather prediction
    program, in a new communication satellite program, and in
    preparation for probing the distant planets of Mars and Venus,
    probes which may some day unlock the deepest secrets of the
    universe.â€

    letter to Chairman Robert S. Kerr, of the Senate Committee on
    Aeronautical and Space Sciences, on the broad scientific and
    technological gains to be achieved in landing n man on the Moon
    arid returning him to Earth. Dr. Dryden pointed out that this
    difficult goal â€œhas the highly important role of accelerating the
    development of space science and technology, motivating the
    scientists and engineers who are engaged in this effort to move
    forward with urgency, and integrating their efforts in a way that
    cannot be accomplished by a disconnected series of research inves-
    tigations in several fields. It is important to realize, however,
    that the real values and purposes are not in the mere accomplish-
    ment of man setting foot on the Moon but rather in the great
    cooperative national effort in the development of science and
    technology which is stimulated by this goal.â€ Dr. Dryden
    pointed out that â€œthe billions of dollars required in this effort are
    not spent on the Moon; they are spent in the factories, workshops,
    and laboratories of our people for salaries, for new materials, and
    supplies, which in turn represent income for others * * *. The
    national enterprise involved in the goal of manned lunar landing
    and return within this decade is an activity of critical impact on
    the future of this Nation as an industrial and military power, and
    as a leader of a free world.â€

     of the Office of Aerospace Research, reported that predictions of
     OARâ€™S Solar Laboratory a t Sacramento Peak, N. Mex., were
     borne out by the flights of the U.S.S.R.â€™s Vostok I and 11. High
     proton shower activity associated with solar flares had been pre-
     dicted for April 1961, except from April 11 through 14 (Major
     Gagarinâ€™s flight in Vostok I was on April 12). August 6, the day
     of the launching of Major Titovâ€™s l7-orbit flight, was the â€œsafest
     dayâ€ for low solar activity on record since 1955.
September 20: Robert Gilruth and other officials of the Space Task
     Group made survey of the new site of the Manned Spacecraft
     Center near Houston, Tex., to seek temporary operational quar-
     ters as soon as possible. Permanent quarters will be constructed
     under the supervision of the Army Corps of Engineers.

     Silverstein was named Director of the Lewis Research Center and
     Robert R. Gilruth, Director of the Manned Spacecraft Center.
September 24: Speaking a t the Air Force Association convention in
     Philadelphia, Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, Commander of the Air
     Force Systems Command, said that â€œthe United States has been
     notably slow to recognize the military application of new inven-
     tions. Two of the most significant inventions of this century-
     the airplane and the liquid-fuel rocket-are American inventions.
     Yet in each case their first application was made by other na-
     tions.â€ Gen. Schriever also stated: â€˜â€˜We should recognize that
     there is no inherent difference between basic military and non-
     military space technology. What really matters is not the tech-
     nology but the intent * * * space power must become a vital
     part of our national strength and security.â€
        NASA made a grant to Stanford Universityâ€™s School of
     Medicine for development of design of payload instrumentation
     to determine existence of life forms on nearby planets, a project
     under the direction of Dr. Joshua Lederberg and Dr. Elliott C.
     Leventhal.
September 25: I n a stirring address to the Assembly of the United
     Nations meeting in New York, President John F. Kennedy
     called for â€œworld law in the age of self determinationâ€ rather than
     a â€œworld war in the age of mass extermination.â€ Among basic
     proposals for waging effective peace, he urged â€œkeeping nuclear
     weapons from seeding new battlegrounds in outer space.â€ I n
     projecting the theme that â€œthe events and decisions of the next
     10 months may well decide the fatâ€™e of man of the next 10,000
     years,â€ President Kennedy spoke of the impact of space explora-
     tion as follows:
        â€œAs we extend the rule of law on Earth, so must we also extend
     it to manâ€™s new domain-outer space.
        â€œAll of us salute the brave cosmonauts of the Soviet Union.
     The new horizons of outer space must not be riven by the old
     bitter concepts of imperialism and sovereign claims. The cold
     reaches of the universe must not become the new arena of an
     even colder war.
        â€œTOthis end, we shall urge proposals extending the United
     Nations Charter to the limits of manâ€™s exploration in the uni-
     verse, reserving outer space for peaceful use, prohibiting weapons
     of mass destruction in space or on celestial bodies, and opening
     the mysteries and benefits of space to every nation * * *.â€

        In article in New York Times, Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Execu-
     tive Secretary, National Aeronautics and Space Council, said:
     â€œIn my view, we [the United States] do not have a division be-
     tween peaceful and nonpeaceful objectives for space. Rather,
     we have space missions to help keep the peace and space missions
     to enable us to live better in peace.â€
--      In article in New York Times, Mr. George J. Feldman, con-
     sultant to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics,
    outlined several areas of international space law that urgently
    require solution, including sovereignty in space, liability for
     damage from spacecraft, conflicts of interest arising from space
     experiments, sovereignty claims on celestial bodies, and the inter-
    national allocation of satellite radio frequencies. Communica-
     tions satellites make latter point particularly critical, as well as
     posin an unprecedented problem in American contract and anti-

        NASA Administrator Webb, speaking to the American Rocket
     Society, said NASA scientists â€œare going to consider the rendez-
     vous technique with great care before going ahead with Nova.â€
     Decision on whether to give priority to the rendezvous technique
     would probably be made by the end of 1961, he said.
        Final report of House Committee on Science and Astronautics
     relating to their hearings on â€œCommercial Applications of Space
     Communications Systemsâ€ released, having among its conclusions:
        (1) Because of worldwide interest and potential usefulness of
     a space communications system, the US. Government must
     â€œretain maximum flexibility regarding the central question of
     ownership and operation of the system.â€
        (2) NASA will not only evaluate the various commercial pro-
     posals but will â€œconduct all space launches and retain direct
     control over all launching equipment, facilities, and personnel.â€
        (3) Research and development of military space communica-
     tions systems should continue to be conducted by DOD but all
    research and development in space communications â€œshould be
     conducted under the general supervision of NASA in accordance
    with its statutory mandate to â€˜plan, direct, and conduct aero-
    nautical and space activitiesâ€™ â€ as well as evaluate the technical
     merits of proposed systems.
        I n a luncheon address to the American Rocket Society, Gen.
    Bernard A. Schriever said: â€˜(1     have been, am being, and, if the
    situation is not changed, will continue to be inhibited if our space
     efforts continue to be carried out under an unnecessary, self-
    imposed national restriction ; namely, the artificial division be-
    tween space for peaceful purposes and space for military pur-
    poses.â€ Asserting USAF management experience in space sys-
    tems, General Schriever added: â€œThere is no short cut to the
    creation of a team of dedicated and experienced men with a
    tradition of accomplishment .â€
        Jacqueline Cochran set womanâ€™s altitude record of 56,071.3

October IS: In speech a t the American Rocket Society, Vice President
    Lyndon B. Johnson stated: â€œIf I could get one message to you it
    would be this: The future of this country and the welfare of the
    free world depend upon our success in space. There is no room
    in this country for any but a fully cooperative, urgently motivated
     all-out effort toward space leadership. No one person, no one

    labs would hereafter be the â€œprimary meansâ€ for carrying out
     military weapon programs ; that DOD would seek tin increase
     in the number of supergrade scientific positions and would ask
     for the wine top pay for scientists as NASA has; that labs would
    be given increased status in the chain of command; and that
    lab directors will be given funds they can spend for research
     without prior approval.
        NASA Administrator Webb, speaking a t the 20th American
     Assembly, said the accelerated space program was necessary or
     else â€œwe would see the Russians, with the advantage of their
     advance position in booster thrust, stay continuously ahead.
     * * * The cost over the 10 years of the accelerated program will
     very probably be less than if it were stretched out over 15 years.â€

     presentation, NASA Administrator Webb said: â€œTo Americans
     seeking answers, proof that man can survive in the hostile realm
     of space is not enough. A solid and meaningful foundation for
     public support and the basis for our Apollo man-in-space effort
     is that U.S. astronauts are going into space to do useful work in
     the cause of all their fellow men.â€
        â€œSuch fights as those of Freedom 7 are not stunts. They are
     not antithetical to sober scientific and technological research.

-_      I n speech on â€œScientists and Engineers in the Space Program,â€
     Albert F. Siepert, NASA Director of Administration, outlined
     NASAâ€™s basic policies on personnel. He pointed out that of
     NASAâ€™s some 20,000 employees, only 4,000 had come to NASA
     through individual appointments, the remainder on transfer of
     organizations intact to NASA. NASAâ€™s personnel utilization
     practices, Siepert said, were as follows: (1) Donâ€™t use a scientist
     or engineer when another skill will do as well; (2) classify a manâ€™s
     skills by what he actually does, rather than how he was formallv
     trained; (3) provide professional entrance into the Federal civil
     service through an examination which is work centered rat,her
     than academically oriented ; (4) take on-the-job training tirid edu-
     cation seriously; (5) encourage professional recognition outside
     the agency; and (6) recognize that job satisfaction depends upon
     the manâ€™s continued interest in his work as well as his take-home
     pay.â€

66     AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS O F 1 9 6 1

November $1: I n a speech on â€œOur National Program in Space,â€
    NASA Administrator Webb said:
       â€œIn carrying out its responsibilities, NASA cooperates with
    and depends upon private industry, universities, and many other
    Government agencies-not only the Department of Defense, the
    Atomic Energy Commission, and the Bureau of Standards, but
    the Weather Bureau, the Federal Communications Commission,
    the Federal Aviation Agency, the National Science Foundation,
    and others.
       â€œIt has been only 4 years since the first manmade satellite
    orbited the Earth. Since then, progress in this new field of
    space has been tremendous. 1 believe that in the years ahead
    the rate of progress will trace H steeply ascending curve. 1
    believe also that the many problems we will solve to achieve
    manned exploration of space will create a wealth of new materials,
    consumer goods, processes, and techniques, thus opening a host
    of new jobs, careers, opportunities for investment, and a general
    national growth.
       â€œWe can be first in space if we advance our scientific and
    technical knowledge a t the most rapid rate possible, and if we
    go forward with the sustained effort that it requires. That is
    the basis of our national space effort.â€
       Titan ICBM launched from Cape Canaveral carrying target
    nose cone to be used in Nike-Zeus antimissile-missile tests. This
    was first Titan ICBM to be fired from Cape Canaveral by a

           AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1 9 6 1

    November 26: Russian scientist, K. Florensky, reported in Komsomol
        Pravda that a cometâ€™s head, not a meteorite or an interplanetary
        atomic weapon, caused the big explosion that jarred Siberia on
        June 30, 1908. The blast near the Hunguska River killed 1,500
        reindeer, felled trees over an area of 700 square miles, and was
        recorded on seismographs around the world.
    November 27: The United States presented an outline for a program
        for cooperation and control in outer space to the U.N. Committee
        on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space meeting in New York. This
        was the first committee meeting held since its membership was ex-
        panded from 18 to 24 nations by the General Assembly 2 years
        ago, the 7 Communist members refusing to attend until today.
        U.N. Delegate Charles W. Yost urged consideration of the US.
        proposals before the life of this Committee expired a t the end of
        the year. The US. proposals were: acknowledge that inter-
        national law and U.N. Charter extend to outer space; establish
        central registry for all space launchings and satellites; and share
        all information from weather satellites.
           USAF reported that Lincoln Laboratoryâ€™s Millstone Hill radar
        at West Ford, Mass., had made three sightings on November 3,
        13, and 15, which might be the missing package of 350 million
        copper needles launched into orbit on October 21.
           Senator Robert Kerr announced that he would introduce legis-
        lation to authorize private ownership of the U.S. portion of the
        proposed worldwide communications satellite system. His bill
        would create the â€œSatellite Communications Corp.â€ which the
        participating firms would buy.
           The Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation announced
        openings for 18 young scientists and engineers for graduate
        study in rockets, jet propulsion, space flight and space structures
        a t Cal Techâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Aerospace Laboratory
        a t Princeton, and the Institute of Flight Structures a t Columbia.
        Established in 1949, Guggenheim fellowship program in the
        aerospace sciences has provided financial aid to 142 students to
        date.
            General Curtis E. LeMay, Chief of Staff, U S . Air Force, said
        in interview with U.S. News & World Report:
            â€œI think weâ€™re a t the period of space technology that we were
        in aeronautical technology along about 1914. At that time no one
        could predict the type of weapon systems that the airplane was
        going to produce, or the transportation system that it would
        eventually produce. As a matter of fact, it was pretty much a
        laughing stock-a very expensive toy.
            â€œWe, of course, initially did a very poor job in our development
        program to advance the science of aeronautics in this country.
        I hope we do a better job in space. At the present time we canâ€™t
        predict what will eventually come out of research in space in the
        way of weapon systems or commercial vehicles or any other
        use that we might put space to. I am sure that men are going
        out into space. Iâ€™m sure that theyâ€™ll find useful things to do out
        there, and Iâ€™m sure that, unless something is done to preclude it,
        theyâ€™ll find things to fight over out there, too.â€

December 4: Ambassador Adlai Stevenson introduced a resolution
    before the U.N.â€™s Political Committee for a U.N. space program
    guided by four considerations: (1) Application of the principles
    of international law to outer space and celestial bodies to ensure
    against sovereignty claims in space; (2) making the U.N. a clear-
    inghouse for use of outer space, including information on satellite
    launchings and cooperation for peaceful use of outer space; (3)
    international cooperation on weather satellite information; (4)
    international cooperation on communications satellites.
       Ambassador Stevenson said: â€œThere is a right way and a wrong
    way to get on with the business of space exploration. I n our
    judgment, the wrong way is to allow the march of science to be-
    come a runaway race into the unknown.
       â€œThe right way is to make it an ordered, peaceful and coopera-
    tive and constructive forward march under the aegis of the United
    Nations.â€™â€™
       Reported from Cape Canaveral that Astronaut John H. Glenn,
    Jr., had moved into â€œready roomâ€ quarters. NASA had made
    no announcement whether a man would ride in the next Mercury
    capsule.
       USAF fired a Blue Scout rocket from Point Arguello, Calif.,
    aimed at a point some 27,600 miles out in space and over the South
    Pole, to measure low-energy protons originating from the Sun.

       AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1961

December 6: A new world aircraft altitude record for sustained hori-
    zontal flight was claimed by Comdr. George W. Ellis, U.S. Navy,
    who flew an F4H Phantom I1 a t 66,443.8 feet over Edwards Air
    Force Base, Calif.
       AEC-NASA Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) selected
    the proposal of the Aetron Division of Aerojet-General Cop. as
    the basis for negotiating an architect and engineering contract
    for an $8 million downward-firing test stand for the Nerva engine.
    The Nerva would be used in nuclear rockets with a reactor derived
    from the Kiwi B test series.
       Reported by Drew Pearson that CIA had warned that Russia
    â€œis preparing to launch a man around the moon in 60 days.â€
December 6: The first Project Mercury manned orbital flight, MA-6,
    was scheduled by NASA for early in 1962 after analysis of the data
    from the MA-5 chimpanzee orbital flight indicated that the Mer-
    cury-Atlas system and the tracking network were ready for
    manned orbital flight.
       Astronauts Alan B. Shepard, Jr., commander, U.S. Navy, and
    Virgil I. Grissom, captain, US. Air Force, were awarded the
    first astronaut wings (almost identical design of a shooting star
    imposed on the traditional pilotâ€™s badge) in a joint ceremony by
    their respective services.
       U.S.S.R. raised its expenditure on science by 12 percent in its
    1962 budget. The Minister of Finance, Vasily Garbuzov, an-
    nounced that the 1962 expenditure on science would be 4,300
    million rubles ($4,773 million). Also announced was a 44-percent
    increase in the defense budget to 13,400 million rubles ($14,874
    million).
       Italian Air Force crew fired Jupiter IRBM from Atlantic
    Missile Range, the third such launching.
December 7: NASA postponed its projected manned orbital flight from
    December 1961 until early in 1962 because of minor problems
    with the cooling system and positioning devices in the Mercury
    capsule, Dr. Hugh Dryden, Deputy Administrator of NASA, said
    in a Baltimore interview. (â€˜You like to have a man go with every-
    thing just as near perfect as possible. This business is risky.
    You canâ€™t avoid this, but you can take all the precautions you
    know about.â€
       Plans for the development of a two-man Mercury capsule were
    announced by Robert Gilruth, Director of NASAâ€™s Manned
    Spacecraft Center. The two-man capsule, to be built by McDon-
    ne1 Aircraft Corp., would be similar in shape to the Mercury
    capsule but slightly larger and two to three times heavier. Its
    booster rocket was announced to be the USAF Titan 1 ,scheduled
                                                          1
    for flight test early in 1962. One of the major objectives in the
    two-man capsule program would be a test of orbital rendezvous,
    in which the two-man capsule would be put into orbit by the
    Titan I1 and would attempt to rendezvous with an A ena stage
                                                          8
    put into orbit by an Atlas rocket. Total cost for a ozen two-
    man capsules plus boosters and other equipment was estimated
    a t $500,000,000. Program name later announced as Gemini.

December 7: Power run completed the test series on the Kiwi B-1A
    reactor system being conducted a t the Nevada Test Site by
    AEC's Los Alnmos Scientific Laboratory. Fourth in a series of
    test reactors in the joint AEC-NASA nuclear rocket propulsion
    program, Kiwi B-1A was disassembled for examination a t the
    conclusion of the test runs.
       Second Atlas ICBM launched by SAC crew, from Vandenberg
--
    Air Force Base.
       Preproposal conference on the contract for design, research,
    development, fabrication, and testing of the reactor-in-flight-test
    (Rift) vehicle was held a t Marshall Space Flight Center. This
    vehicle would test-fly the Nerva nuclear engine now under de-
    velopment. Twenty-nine firms were invited to attend this pre-
    liminary conference at which they were furnished general infor-
    mation on the project. Interested firms would then have 30 days
    to file information on their capabilities and experience. Then a
    smaller number of firms would be invited to submit detailed bids.
    Purpose of the two-step evaluation was to enable firms not in a
    competitive position to avoid the expense of entering detailed
    proposals.
       United States and Soviet delegates to the United Nations
    informally discussed the question of the political makeup of the
    U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Cses of Outer Spacc and 011 a
    possible joint resolution in that Committee.
December 8: NASA selected Mason-Rust as the contractor to provide
    support services a t NASA's hlichoud plant near New Orleans,
    providing housekeeping services through June 30, 1962, for the
    three contractors who would produce the Saturn S-I and S-IB
    boosters and the Rift nuclear upper-stage vehicle.
       USAF fired an Aerobee sounding rocket from Point Arguello,
    Calif.,.out over the Pacific 1,300 miles high arid 900 miles toward
    Hawaii, at which point the rocket released three sets of flares to
    be photographed froni California, Hawaii, and Alaska. Purpose
    was to provide a more precise linowledge of the location of Hawaii
    with respect to the North American mainland by means of
    photogrammetric triangulation of the flare photos.
December 9: Solid-propellent rocket motor generating nearly 500,000
    pounds of thrust was fired in a static test of 80-second duration by
    United Technology Corp. a t Sunnyvale, Calif., under USAF
    contract.
       Nike-Zeus antimissile missile was fired from Point Mugu in
--
    its first low-altitude flight, going up to 40,000 feet and then out
    over the Pacific Missile Range at that altitude.
December 10: The Carnegie Institution issued annual report contain-
    ing several findings from its space scientists: Philip Abelson con-
    tended that it was a waste of time and money to sterilize vehicles
    going to the Moon or planets because any life there would be so
    unlike terrestrial life that it could not be contaminated by Earth
    organisms; Horace Babcock offered a theory on alternating spiral
    magnetic fields of the Sun that might explain sunspots, flares,
    and the 22-year magnetic cycle; other scientists noted growing
    evidence of major differences in chemical composition of distant
    stars, indicating a need to revise methods of computing distances
    to those stars.
                                                                   73

December 11 : The U.N.â€™s Political Committee unanimously approved
    a resolution calling on the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer
    Space to meet on March 31, 1962, to begin discussions of world
    cooperation in space. The resolution essentially incorporated
    the four-point U.S. program on the peaceful uses of outer space.
    The U.S.S.R. supported the resolution although it had previously
    rendered the Committee inoperative by boycotting its meetings.
        The national space program portends a major technological
    advance for mankind, NASA Associate Administrator Dr. Robert
     C. Seamans, Jr., told the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce.
     Comparing its potential to that of the invention of the steam
    engine, Dr. Seamans noted:
        â€œTwo aspects of such major advances are characteristic. First,
    the practical results are largely unforeseeable, primarily because
    they develop on broad fronts and, frequently, in unsuspected
    directions. Second, the concentration of effort required does not
    diminish effort expended on other frontiers of knowledge, but
    rather spurs such activities. For example, despite fears that
    space technology would monopolize the scientific effort of this
    country, such fields of activity as oceanography, geophysics, and
    the physics of high-energy particles have greatly increased since
    the national space effort has become a serious one.â€
       Contract awarded by Army Engineers to Brown & Root, Inc.,
    for design of major portion of NASAâ€™s Manned Spacecraft Center
    a t Houston, Tex.
       Survey of leading space experts on US. space goals from 1970-
    75 by the North American Newspaper Alliance produced a con-
    sensus that the United States would establish a Moon base from
    which to thoroughly explore the Moon and to launch interplane-
    tary manned probes. Those interviewed included important
    figures in space industry, USAF, NASA, and space research.
December 1.2: Discoverer XXXVI was launched by the USAF into
    orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., with a piggyback
    10-pound Oscar (orbiting satellite carrying amateur radio) satel-
    lite aboard in addition to the Discoverer payload. Oscar was
    the first satellite built by private citizens to be put in orbit,
    transmitted Morse signal to world amateur radio operators.
       The National Center for Atmospheric Research was inaugu-
    rated a t Boulder, Colo. To include the facilities of the High
    Altitude Observatory of the University of Colorado, to be gov-
    erned by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research,
    a corporation of 14 universities from coast to coast, and to be
    h a n c e d by the National Science Foundation, the center would
    provide a national attack on weather research, including the use
    of tools such as rockets, balloons, and computers too expensive
    for any one university to finance.
       USAF Atlas launched from Atlantic Missile Range carried
    piggyback package of 28 dummy fuel cells in a study of how
    metals evaporate on reentry.
       Army announced that track radar for Nike-Zeus antimissile
    missile had successfully tracked an Atlas ICBM on November 22
    from Ascension Island as well as Echo I 1,500 miles from Earth.

74     AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 19 6 1

December 13: NASA Administrator James E. Webb said in a speech
    in Cleveland that the United States would follow its first manned
    orbital flight in January 1962 with similar manned orbital flights
    every 60 days. These would gather data on effects of weight-
    lessness, needed to determine the pacing of the two-man flight
    program later on. Mr. Webb also forecast the launching of 200
    sounding rockets, 20 scientific satellites, and 2 deep-space probes
    in 1962.
       USAF completed Titan I research and development test flight
    program of 40 launches a t the Atlantic Missile Range; of the 40
    launches 4 had been failures.
December i4: NASA fired a four-stage solid-fuel Trailblazer rocket
    from Wallops Station, Virginia, in the first of a series of reentry
    tests. Two stages boosted the rocket to 167 miles; then the other
    two drove the nose cone down through the atmosphere at 14,000
    miles per hour.
       Nike-Zeus firing in extended range from Point Mugu attained
    all test objectives.
December 15: NASAâ€™s Explorer XI1 satellite returned voluminous
    data revising previous information on the Van Allen radiation
    belts and showing them to be no substantial problem to manned
    space flight. Launched on August 15, 1961, and transrnitting
    until December 6, 1961, Explorer XI1 returned information
    amounting to 5,636 telemetry tapes (2,400 feet each). Of prin-
    cipal interest was its finding that the Van Allen belts consist of
    a preponderance of protons over electrons in a ratio of 1,000 to 1.
    Since the protons are of less than 1 million electron volts energy,
    they do not themselves offer a serious radiation problem and
    serve to slow the velocity of other radiation.
--     S-IB stage of the Advanced Saturn launch vehicle would be
    built by the Boeing Co., NASA announced. The $300 million
    contract, to run through 1966, called for development, construc-
    tion, and test of 24 flight stages, plus several for ground tests.
    Assembly would take place at the NASA Michoud Operations
    Plant, New Orleans, La. The S-IB would be the first stage of
     the vehicle that would launch the three-man Apollo spacecraft
     for direct circumlunar flight or, with rendezvous, for lunar landing.
       I n a ceremony at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., the USAF
    graduated its first class o five pilot-engineers from its school for
                                E
    space pilots. Graduates were awarded advanced technical degrees.
December 18: Dr. Robert Jastrow, Chief of Theoretical Division and
     Director of the Institute for Space Studies, Goddard Space Flight
    Center, making the 25th annual Wright Rrothersâ€™ Lecture before
     the Institute of Aerospace Sciences, reviewed progress in the space
    sciences, said the most exciting and fruitful area thus far had
    been investigation of â€œsolar control over the atmosphere of the
    Earth, causes of weather activity in the lower atmosphere, and
     the structure of the upper atmosphere.â€
        NASA announced that the first station in a network of data-
     gathering stations for use with second-generation satellites had
     been completed near Fairbanks, Alaska. Site for the second of
     the $5 million installations, each with a high-gain antenna 85 feet
     in diameter, was announced to be Rosman, N.C., 40 miles south-
     west of Asheville.
                                                                    75
       AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 1 9 6 1

December 18: USAF awarded an additional $52 million contract to
    North American Aviation for development of a prototype B-70
    bomber, bringing to $267 million the amount allocated for the
    B-70.
       Capsule from Discoverer XXXVI was ejected from orbit after
    6 da s and a record of 64 orbits, landed in the Pacific near Hawaii,
        %
    was ept afloat by 3 USAF pararescue men until arrival of Navy
    destroyer.
       USAF Minuteman ICBM successfully fired from a silo and
    traveled 3,600 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range, the second
    consecutive successful silo launching.
       Successful test of a new way to steer large-size rockets was
    announced by United Technology Corp., an experimental method
    called liquid thrust vector control (TVC), in which a gas or liquid
    is spra ed into the exhaust path of a rocket engine, deflecting
    the e d a u s t and thereby turning the vehicle. The test was
    made with a 450,000-pound-thrust solid-fuel engine.
       DOD summary statement on the x-15 program stated that
    to that date there had been 45 flights of the x-15, with planned
    performance achieved on 42 and the prime research objectives
    achieved on 40. The 98-percent launch success record of the
    X-15 was attributed to ( I ) use of alternate modes for subsystems
    and (2) the presence of a pilot to detect malfunctions in sub-
    systems. This compared to a 43-percent launch record for an
    unmanned missile with no alternate modes in subsystems.
December 19: NASA announced that Ira H. Abbott, Director of
    Advanced Research and Technology, would retire in January
    after 32 years service with NACA and NASA. Beginning with
    the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory in 1929, Abbott became
    internationally known for his aerodynamic research, in more
    recent years as supervisor of x-15, supersonic transport, nuclear
    rocket, and advanced reentry development programs.
December 19-20: A technical conference on problems of runway
    slush in winter jet operations was held in Washington under
    joint sponsorship of the Federal Aviation Agency and NASA.
    The conference, open to aviation representatives, reviewed the
    extensive research flight tests conducted a t FAAâ€™s National
    Aviation Facilities Experimental Center and other experimental
    and theoretical work done a t NASAâ€™s Langley Research Center.
    Interest in all experiments centered on the adverse effects of run-
    way slush on takeoff and landing characteristics of jet aircraft.
    Research findings were that on both takeoff and landing in heavy
    slush jetliners tend to act like â€œa sailboat without a keel,â€ that
    a t takeoff speeds heavy slush causes jetliners to lose the effect
    of nose wheel steering and most of their braking power. Recom-
    mendations included the devising of a quick and accurate means
    of measuring runway slush and suspension of jet operations when
    slush reached a depth of 1 inch.
December 2 : X-15 No. 3 made first flight, a successful test of new
           0
    automated control system, NASAâ€™s Neil A. Armstrong as pdot
    in his first flight of XLR-99-engined X-15. At half throttle,
    X-15 reached speed of 2,502 miles per hour and an altitude
    of 81,000 feet.

December 20: KASA announced that Douglas Aircraft had bcen
    selected for negotiation of a contract to modify the Saturn S-IV
    stage by installing a single 200,000-pound-thrust, Rocketdyne J-2
    liquid-hydrogenfliquid-oxygen engine instead of six 15,000-pound-
    thrust P. & W. hydrogenloxygen engines. Known as S-IVB,
    this modified stage will be used in advanced Saturn configura tâ€˜ions
    for manned circumlunar Apollo missions.
__- Two new radiotelescopes, one at Cambridge University and
    the other at Jodrell Bank, would be constructed with grants from
    Britainâ€™s Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
    totaling $3,360,000. The Cambridge telescope would consist,
    of three 52-foot paraboloidal aerials, two fixed and one rail-
    mounted, designed to examine A limited area of the sky with
    greater precision than present equipment. The Jodrell addition
    would be a 125-foot telescope to be used in conjunction with the
    present 250-foot telescope.
___ USAF launched Atlas ICBM from Cape Canaveral with it
    rhesus monkey in a side-mounted pod on a flight 5,000 miles long
    and 600 miles in altitude. The flight was intended to produce
    information on reactions to launch and reentry conditions much
    more severe than in human flights. The monkey survived the
    flight but recovery attempts failed.
___ In San Bernardino news conferericc, Gen. Bernard Schriever,
    U.S. Air Force, said: â€œI have never fclt we were behind Russia
    in missile development .â€
December $1: Army Nike-Zeus antimissile missile successfully inter-
    cepted a Nike-Hercules missile flying a t over 3,000 miles per hour
    over White Sands Missile Range, while another Nike-Zeus
    made highest flight to date from Point Mugu and another Nike-
    Zeus was launched from Kwajalein Island in the South Pacific.
December $2: Unnamed USAF satellite launched from Point Arguello,
    Calif. The announcement said it was powered by an Atlas-
    Agena B combination and that the satellite was â€œcarrying a num-
    ber of classified test components.â€
       NASA selected Air Products & Chemicals to supply additional
    liquid hydrogen for west coast development projects, a $35 million
    contract to be negotiated for a &year period.
December 26: Development time schedule for Dyna-Soar was reduced
    when DOD authorized the USAF to move directly from â‚¬3-52
    drop tests to unmanned and then manned orbital flights. This
    eliminated the previous interim stage of suborbital flights to be
    powered by the Titan I1 booster. USAF announced it \vas
    canceling the Titan I1 development contract held by the Martin
    Co. and negotiating a new contract for a larger booster.
       Ten scientific organizations recommended that the American
    Association for the Advancement of Science create a new section
    to deal with scientific information and communication. The
    problem was seen to be one of an overabundance of informiition
    not accessible for the scientist, particularly in interdisciplinary
    science. Only three other new sections have been created in the
     American Association for the Advancement of Science in this
    century.
                                                                    77
       AERONAUTICAL AND ASTRONAUTICAL EVENTS OF 19 6 1

December $7: The â€œrace in spaceâ€ between the United States and
    U.S.S.R. was the top news story of 1961, with the Berlin crisis
    running second, according to a poll of Associated Press member
    newspapers and radio stations.
       Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Com-
    mission, speaking before the American Association for the Ad-
    vancement of Science, said that although science had become a
    determining factor in national and international events, its
    effectiveness was hampered because educated men did not under-
    stand science. Yet, he said, science was truly a part of the
    humanities; â€œWho in our times can make an adequate criticism
    of life without knowledge of the ideals, the methods, the dynamics
    of science?â€
       DOD and USAF revealed that the B-70 bomber may be re-
    designated RSB-70 (reconnaissance-strike-bomber) and its mis-
    sion changed from tracking known, fixed targets to seeking out
    and destroying unknown, hidden, or uncertain tar ets.
                                                        !f
       Dr. Carl Sagen, of University of California (Berke ey), disputed
    the â€œspace seedâ€ life theory in American Association for the
    Advancement of Science paper. â€œPanspermicâ€ theory did not
    seem plausible in the light of the fierce environment of space and
    the vastness of the universe, he said.
December 28: Titan 1 ,an advanced ICBM and the booster designated
                      1
    for NASAâ€™s two-man orbital flights, was successfully captive-fired
    for the first time a t the Martin Co.â€™s Denver facilities. The test
    not only tested the flight vehicle but the checkout and launch
    equipment intended for operational use.
December 29: Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of NASA,
    speaking in Denver before the American Association for the
    Advancement of Science, said: â€œThe sheer magnitude of the
    manned lunar exploration program, amounting as it will to $3
    billion or more [in fiscal year 19631, represents a significant
    application of the Nationâ€™s resources. These billions of dollars
    will be spent in the laboratories, workshops, and factories of the
    Nation and thus constitute a significant factor in the Nationâ€™s
    employment and economy generally. The personnel in the
    space program are not all scientists and engineers but come from
    every walk of life.
       â€œThe ultimate and practical purpose of these large expendi-
    tures is twofold: (1) Insurance of the Nation against scientific
    and technological obsolescence in a time of explosive advances in
    science and technology; and ( 2 ) insurance against the hazard of
    military surprise in space.â€
       Dr. Joseph F. Shea was appointed Deputy Director for Systems
    Engineering, Office of Manned Space Flight, NASA headquarters,
                to D. Brainerd Holmes, NASAâ€™s Director of Manned
    reportinf
    Space F ight. Dr. Shea came to NASA from Space Technology
    Laboratories.
       Dr. Arthur Rudolph was appointed Assistant Director of
    Systems Engineering in NASAâ€™s Office of Manned Space Flight.
    Operating out of the Marshall Space Fli h t Center, Dr. Rudolph
                                             f
    would serve as liaison between vehicle evelopment a t Marshal!
    and the manned space flight program a t the Manned Spacecraft
    Center in Houston.

December SO: Navy HSS-2 Sea King helicopter flown a t 199 miles per
    hour for 3-kilometer distance claimed world record a t Windsor
    Locks, Conn., by Commander P. L. Sullivan, U.S. Navy, and
    Capt. D. A. Spurlock, U.S. Marine Corps.
December SI: NASA established a Management Council to ensure the
    orderly and timely progress in the manned space flight programs.
    The Council, composed of senior officials from NASA head-
    quarters, Marshall Space Flight Center, and the Manned Space-
    craft Center, and chaired by D. Brainerd Holmes, Director of
    the Office of Manned Space Flight, would meet a t least once a
    month to identify and resolve problems as early as possible and
    to coordinate the interface problems.
       Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Associate Administrator)
    said in a radio interview that a second Venus probe had been
    added to NASAâ€™s 1962 program as insurance for the first probe
    scheduled in August. Both probes would be the Mariner R,
    the reduced-weight version resorted to because of time slippage
    in the Centaur booster program. Dr. Seamans also said the
    United States plans three attempts to land instrumented packages
    on the Moon in 1962.
During December: General Electric announced operation of the largest
    solar therinionic power system a t GEâ€™s solar test facility near
    Phoenix, Ariz. Early tests generated an output of 12.18 watts
    and unit has potential efficiency of 15 to 20 percent of the total

       Japanâ€™s launch facilities for its rocket research program would
    be moved from Akita on the northwest coast of Honshu to Kago-
    shima on the southern tip of Kiushu, according to an announce-

    on Rockets and Astronautics in Tokyo.
       USIA reported that U S . space achievements were a leading
    item in their overseas information program and covered all media.
    USTA concluded : â€œThe policy of â€˜opennessâ€™ observed in both
    U.S. manned space flights during the year dramatized the basic
    difference between the American open society and the Soviet
    closed society, and drew widespread approval from commentators
    throughout the free world. The availability of full information
    about the events through all news media, together with the pres-
    ence of foreign correspondents- who gave firsthand, on-the-spot
    coverage- enabled oversea audiences to achieve a high degree of
    self-identification with one of the greatest adventures of our
    times. )â€™

   The following chart was prepared from open public sources by
Dr. Frank W. Anderson, Jr., Deputy NASA Historian. Sources
included â€œSatellite Situation Reportsâ€ prepared by the Space Opera-
tions Control Center a t Goddard Space Flight Center and the â€œSpace
Activity Summariesâ€ prepared by NASAâ€™s Office of Public Informa-
tion. Russian data are unofficial.
   It is a characteristic of documenting space flights that the data
processing of telemetry requires time, sonietimes in the order of
months, until scientific results are available. The documentation of
such results thus remains a problem resolutely attacked but not fully
solved. Comments are invited.
