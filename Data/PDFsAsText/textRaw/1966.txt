   At the opening of the tenth year in the era of manâ€™s mobility in outer
space, we can look back on 1966 as offering convincing evidence that the
United States had gained great competence. This evidence included: five
orbital space flights by ten Gemini astronauts; four lunar missions under-
taking the orbiting of and softlanding on the moon; numerous contributions
to scientific knowledge by unmanned spacecraft and sounding rockets; and
further demonstrations of the practical utility of operational space systems,
including weather and communications satellites.
   During 1966, a record 100 American spacecraft were placed into earth
orbit or on escape trajectories. Thousands of revealing and useful pictures
of the earth were taken from space and of the moon from lunar orbit and
on its surface. The Gemini program ended with rendezvous and docking
experiments and extravehicular activity by the Gemini test pilots as the
Apollo R&D test flights leading to the manned lunar mission came into the
schedule. Thirty-five major scientific, technological, and operational mile-
stones were cited for 1966 by the President in his Report to the Congress on
aeronautical and space activities of the United States. This was one measure
of the American commitment to share in the peaceful exploration of space
for all mankind. Another was our support of the final steps toward a United
Nations space treaty, undertaken to ensure that the peaceful exploitation
of space had juridical basis in international law.
   Spectacular as some events in the space venture were in 1966, they
nonetheless came to have diminished novelty in the eyes of many laymen.
The multitude of both important and unspectacular space activities attained
almost an accepted and routine place. This volume, as well as its predecessor
chronicles, offers a ready reference on the major as well as the less-well-
known events. Beyond the welter of documented details on the complex
 nature of aeronautical and space related events and their impact, this
volume helps to provide a better perspective upon today as we contemplate
tomorrow. Such intent also serves future historians and analysts who
 cannot be unmindful of what is herein presented.
   When the Congress created the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration in 1958, it charged NASA with the responsibility to â€œcontribute
 materially to . . . the expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the
atmosphere and spaceâ€™â€™ and to â€œprovide for the widest practical and ap-
propriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and results
 thereof.â€ NASA has attempted to do this and to include documentation for
 the historical record. The relating of NASA history begins with this day-by-
 day chronicle and leads to more specialized studies and histories of the
 unprecedented task of extending manâ€™s mobility and understanding beyond
 his planet. While a chronology cannot in itself serve as a full-fledged
 history, the size of this annual volume alone is illustrative of the scope
 and complexity of the historical task yet to be completed as memories fade
 and the records disappear.

   Before the commentator or the administrator or the scholar can analyze
and interpret the record in his search for understanding and lessons, there
must be a factual account. This chronology, like its predecessors, is the
beginning of such a record. Drawn from open public sources, it has the
serious limitations of any work based largely on quickly available sources
and further of being done virtually on the heels of the events it chronicles.
But these limitations are offset by the assets of the historical method; by
the very catholicity of material and interests included it helps open new
vistas of relationship, of cause and effect. Because a chronology is limited
for the user who does not have a date for the particular item he seeks, an
extensive crossreference system is presented in the detailed index. And
to provide the broadest possible context, we have included worldwide space-
related material, to the extent it was available to us.
   The entire NASA Historical Staff in Headquarters participated in source
collection, review, and publication. The Science and Technology Division of
the Library of Congress was responsible for drafting of the text proper, in
the persons of Miss Lynn Catoe, Mrs. Anne Horton, and Miss Shirley
Medley. Miss Jane Adams and Mrs. Carmen Brock-Smith translated com-
ment edition into final manuscript. The index was prepared by Arthur G.
Renstrom, also of the Library of Congress. General editor of the volume
was Frank W. Anderson, Jr.; Mrs. Helen T. Wells was technical editor.
Creston Whiting (uss) provided timely translations of Russian materials.
Historians and historical monitors throughout NASA contributed slseful
materials. Validation was the constant concern of many busy persons
throughout NASA.
   Appendix A, â€œSatellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights, 1966,â€

   This preliminary chronicle is but a first step in the historical process
 of documenting the dynamic and complex events of space exploration and
 exploitation. Comments, additions, and criticism are welcomed.

                             January 1966

January 1: MSFC Director Dr. Wernher von Braun named Dr. Jerry 6. McCall
    to organize and manage the Experiments and Applications Office-MSFCâ€™S
    portion of Apollo Applications; Stan Reinartz would assist him. (MSFC

0 The strongest nation will be the one that applies chemistry most effec-

    tively, wrote Science editor Philip Abelson in Saturday Review: â€œThe
    long-range interests of this nation require a strong chemical profession
    and basic to it are strong chemistry departments in the universities.
    Yet, while NASA was receiving an annual $5 billion, a sum that repre-
    sented almost all the money asked by the agency, chemistry received
    only a small fraction of its requests. . . . In my estimation, chemistry,
    for the long haul, is ten to 100 times as important as space, yet it
    receives only about one percent as much money.â€ (SR, 1/1/66, 102)
January 2: Changes in organizational structure of NASA Hq. were effective
    this date. Most important change was establishment of an organizational
    unit called the Office of the Administrator, which included the Deputy
    Administrator and his staff, the Associate Administrator and his staff,
    and the Executive Secretariat. Dr. Robert C . Seamans, Jr., newly ap-
    pointed Deputy Administrator, was continuing to serve as Associate
    Administrator. Willis H. Shapley, Associate Deputy Administrator,
    serving as the principal assistant to Administrator James E. Webb and
    to Dr. Seamans, was responsible for policy planning and for general
    supervision of the agencyâ€™s work processes. The Executive Secretariat,
    headed by Col. Lawrence W. Vogel (USA), was responsible for channeling
    and scheduling work within the Office of the Administrator. Earl D.
    Hilburn continued as Deputy Associate Administrator.
       Director of the Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, Edmond C.
    Buckley, became Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data
    Acquisition. (Other Associate Administrators . were Dr. George E.
    Mueller, Manned Space Flight; Dr. Homer E. Newell, Space Science
    and Applications; and Dr. Mac C. Adams, Advanced Research and
    Technology.)
       Four Deputy Associate Administrators became Assistant Adminis-
    trators: William B. Rieke, Industry Affairs; D. D. Wyatt, Programming;
    Adm. W. Fred Boone, Defense Affairs; and John D. Young, Admin-
    istration. These were in addition to the four existing Assistant Admin-
    istrators :Richard L. Callaghan, Legislative Affairs ; Arnold W. Frutkin,
                                                                     1

January 2: Dr. Clark Blanchard Millikan, director of Cal Tech Graduate
    Aeronautical Laboratories and pioneer in the development of multi-
    engine, high-altitude airplanes, jet propulsion, and guided missiles, died
    of a heart ailment. Millikan, chairman of the board of JPL in its early
    days, had been awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit for his work in
    wind tunnel research during World War I1 and had been given the
    British Kingâ€™s Medal. (NYT, 1/3/66,27; AP, Balt. Sun, 1/3/66; M&R,
    1/10/66, 13)
January 3: NASA awarded two nine-month study contracts to determine the
    impact of a proposed improved J-2 rocket engine on the S-I1and S-IVB
    stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle: (1)$148,000 contract to North
    American Aviation, Inc., developer of S-I1 stage; and (2) $225,000
    modification to an existing contract with Douglas Aircraft Co. MSFC
    Propulsion and Vehicle Engineering Laboratory was seeking to simplify
    the J-2 and give it, and the stages it powered, more flexibility. (MSFC

    by U.S.S.R., would orbit the earth for more than 1,000 yrs., reported
    Pruvdu. COSMOS c, launched Dec. 17, 1965, would orbit for 10 yrs. and
    ELECTRON I, launched Jan. 30,1964, and ELECTRON 111, launched July 11,
    1964, would orbit for at least 200 yrs. Report said Soviet space tracking
    stations were receiving data from more than 20 sputniks. (AP, Wash.
    Eve. Star, 1/3/66)
0 GSFC Nimbus Project Manager Harry Press told Aviation           Week that
    Nimbus B would move NASAâ€™s       weather satellite program into a second
    generation research and development effort by starting the measure-
    ment of fundamental quantities in the atmosphere necessary in new
    analytical weather-forecasting formulas. Nimbus B, third and largest
    in NASAâ€™s   meteorological satellite series, would carry seven major
    experiments: infrared interferometer spectrometer; satellite infrared
    spectrometer; image dissector camera system; high-resolution infrared
    radiometer; monitor for ultraviolet solar energy; medium-resolution
    infrared radiometer; and interrogation, recording, locating system. In
    addition, Nimbus B would carry Snap-19radioisotope thermal generators
    capable of producing 60 w of power to supplement solar panels and
    determine feasibility of radioisotope generators for ultimate operational
    weather satellite system. Scheduled for launch in 1967 with Extended
    Thrust Augmented Thor-Agena D launch vehicle, Nimbus B would use
    basic Nimbus spacecraft configuration, but would require strengthened
    structural elements because of its additional weight.
       Press said the two major control difficulties which had shortened
    the August 1964 NIMBUS I mission had been analyzed and corrected on
    Nimbus C, scheduled for launch in 1966. A larger solar array drive
    motor, equipped with heat-conducting strap that would lower operating
    temperature of motor almost 100Â°C and with improved grease, would
    be substituted on Nimbus C for smaller motor whose failure had left
    MMBUS 1% solar panels locked in near-vertical position when it ap-
    parently overheated and its grease failed to lubricate. Also, attempts
    would be made during Nimbus C mission to rely on the flywheels to
                                                                             3
                  ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

     dampen spacecraft oscillations and to use the gas thruster system as
     little as possible, Press said. NIMBUS I had spun about its roll axis when
    its depreciating power supply had caused its batteries to feed lower volt-
    ages to the attitude control electronics system and the thrusters had
    fired excessive amounts of cold freon gas. (Av. Wk., 1/3/66, 52, 53)
January 3: Report of the White House Committee on Meteorology concluded
    that global weather experiment using meteorological satellite and net-
    work of sensors on constant-altitude balloons, remote land stations, and
    ocean buoys could be deployed in four years for $50 million. Assignment
    of overall management responsibility given to single agency to begin
    design study was discussed in Aviation Week. Designated Ghost (global
    horizontal sounding technique), project would attempt to extend atmos-
    pheric measurements to that 90% of the earthâ€™s surface not yet
    adequately covered, using meteorological satellite in 600-mi.altitude
    polar orbit to obtain pair of readings from all global points every 12
    hrs. In addition, 1,000 to 3,000 super-pressure balloons would be
    floated at six different atmospheric levels to measure wind, pressure,
    temperature, humidity, and overpressure.
        NASA Nimbus B meteorological satellite, scheduled for launch in
     1967, would carry interrogation, recording, and locating system experi-
    ment (Iris) designed to perform ranging and data collection function on
    which Ghost was based. However, NASA would attempt only limited
    experiments with Iris involving a check of the systemâ€™s ability to locate
    fixed sensor packages, and track them on slow-moving and fast-moving
    platforms, Dr. Morris Tepper, Director, Meteorological Programs Div.,
    NASA Office of Space Science and Applications, told Aviation Week.
    Tepper said any agency providing its own transponders and funding its
    own equipment could participate in the Iris tests. (Av. Wk., 1/3/66,55)
0 Missiles and Rockets reported prediction of Japanese rocket engineer

    Dr. Hideo Itokawa that Japan might launch 60-lb. probes to Mars and
    Venus after orbiting its first satellite in 1968. Itokawa said the Mu
    series launch vehicle, under development by Univ. of Tokyo Institute
    of Space and Aeronautical Science, would produce enough thrust-
    400,000 1bs.-to launch interplanetary probes. (M&R, 1/3/66, 7)

    Center, Edwards AFB, crashed over Puget Sound when attempting an
    instrumented approach to Boeing Field, Seattle, during rainy weather.
    Branch was enroute from Edwards AFB; his body was later recovered
    from Puget Sound by divers. (Seattle Times,1/6/66, 31)
During week o January 3: Representatives of U S . Dept. of Agricultureâ€™s

    Plant Quarantine Div. met with NASAâ€™s      Planetary Quarantine Committee
    to discuss handling and disposal of soil and rock samples brought to
    earth from the moon or other planets. A Dept. of Agriculture spokesman
    warned that without precautions, insects and microorganisms from
    outer space could conceivably be brought to earth on returning space-
    craft and multiply unchecked in an environment that would not control
    them. (NYT, 1/9/66, 58)
January P: NASA MARINER IV, launched from ETR Nov. 28, 1964, for Mars
    flyby July 14, 1965, was 216 million miles from earth-greatest distance
    it would reach before gradually returning to within 30 million miles in
    1967-and still operating. Goldstone Tracking Station of NASAâ€™s         Deep
    Space Network (DSN) tracked a signal from the spacecraft, but no
    attempt was made to receive data because of the extreme distance. DSN

     Saturn V, Boeing Co. received $370,500; North American Aviation, Inc.,
     $329,624; and Douglas Aircraft Co., $96,730. Eight variations of the
     Saturn V vehicle would be examined. Boeing would be study systems
     integration contractor for all prospective configurations involving
     the S-IC stage, NAA for all others. On Saturn IB, Chrysler Corp.
     received $450,000; Douglas, $116,345. Six Saturn IB configurations

 January 5: A ten-year lunar exploration program emphasizing manned
      missions was recommended in reports released by six working groups
      of scientists who had attended NASA 1965 Summer Conference on Lunar
      Exploration and Science in Falmouth, Mass., July 19-31,1965. Program,
      which would utilize capabilities already under development by NASA,
      would gradually include scientific experiments in geology, geochemistry,
      geophysics, and bioscience. One or two manned lunar missions and one
      manned lunar orbital mission would be conducted annually through
       1979, with astronauts remaining on the moonâ€™s surface for longer
      periods after 1974.
6                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

        Reports recommended four requirements for period through 1974: (1)
    assurance of overlapping operation of instruments placed on moon by
    astronauts; (2) sufficient frequency of missions to provide continuity
    in experiments; (3) scheduling of adequate time between missions to
    permit necessary modification of experiments; and (4) gradually increas-
    ing staytimes of astronauts on moon. Top priority for early Apollo
    landing missions would be return of lunar material samples; second
    priority, emplacing Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (Alsep) ;
    third, traversing lunar surface to describe topographic and geological.
    features, supplemented by stereoscopic photography. Report urged
    immediate testing to determine amounts and effects of atmosphere escap-
    ing from Lunar Excursion Module (Lem) and outgassing of astronaut
    suits. One Apollo Applications-Manned Lunar Orbiter mission (Aa-mlo)
    was recommended prior to first Apollo Applications-Manned Lunar
    Surface mission (Aa-mls), with minimum of three manned spacecraft
    missions in polar orbit to make complete lunar survey; five or six Aa-mls
    missions through 1974 were suggested, with larger scientific payloads
    and stays for the astronauts of up to 14 days.
        Reports listed basic types of equipment necessary for exploration
    program: automatic position-recording systems to relay to earth or Lem
    movements of astronauts and roving vehicles; roving vehicles to carry
    one or two astronauts and scientific payload of at least 600 lbs.;
    manned lunar flying vehicle able to carry 300-lb. scientific payload
    about 10 mi. to study features not accessible with roving vehicle; one-
    inch drill capable of penetrating at least 10 ft. in rubble or solid rock
    to assist heat-flow studies and provide samples of possible biological
    interest. Scientific training for astronauts in specific rather than
    general areas was recommended, with emphasis on geology.
        For post-1974 period, the scientists recommended surface travel by
    astronauts up to 500 mi. from landing point and fixed-site investigations
    lasting from two months to a year for measuring geophysical phenomena
    that could vary with time; studying lunar surface processes; deep-drill-
    ing studies to obtain information on early moon history and crustal
    composition; construction and manning of large radio and optical
    telescopes. Roving vehicles for the post-Apollo Applications phase
    should have 500-mi. range, shelter for three-man crew, two-month
    mission capability, and no requirement to return to starting point.

January 5 Twenty-one Long Tank Thors were purchased from Douglas
           :
    Missile and Space Systems Div. by USAF for use in its programs at
    Vandenberg AFB. Expected to succeed the present Thrust Augmented
    Thor (Tat), the Long Tank Thor would provide increased payload
     capability by enlarging the volume of Thorâ€™s liquid propellant tanks;
    result would be a 20% increase in payload capability over Tat. Although
    its total thrust of 330,000 Ibs. would be essentially the same as that for
    Tat, the Long Tank Thor would have a burn time of 216 sec. as com-
    pared to 146 sec. for Tat. (AFSC Release 205.65)

    tion about continental drift, GSFC geologist Dr. Paul D. Lowman said in
    interim report at NASA Hq. on 13scientific and technological experiments
    carried aboard GEMINI V. Color photos of South Africaâ€™s Namib Desert
    revealed 7-million to 8-million-year-old rock formations. Presence of
    similar formations along east coast of South America could indicate two
    continents had once been closer together, Lowman explained. Photos
    also pinpointed â€œa major diamond areaâ€ between rock formations and

           decision to launch Mariner E-MARINER           1x1â€™s backup probe-to
  NASAâ€™s
     Venus rather than Mars was criticized by William Hines in the Washing-
     ton Evening Star: â€œAs a Venus probe, just about everything conceivable
     is wrong with Mariner-E. Its solar panels are too big, but without them
     its center of gravity would be all wrong; its earth-seeking radio antenna-
     essential for long-distance communication-is oriented the wrong way;
     it is protected against cold rather than heat; its instruments are de-
     signed to explore a small planet with a thin atmosphere rather than an
     earth-sized object with a dense one.

  Weather modification is a reality, concluded the National Academy of
      Sciencesâ€™ Panel on Weather and Climate Modification after two-year
      review of scientific aspects of weather control. In a report submitted
      to NAS President Dr. Frederick Seitz, recommendations included :
       (1) immediate study by one agency of research and development in
      weather modification; (2) raising agency support from 1965 level of $5
      million to at least $30 million in 1970; (3) early establishment of several
      carefully designed, randomized seeding experimmts to assess seedability
      of different storm types; (4) careful monitoring and regulation of
      operational programs; and (5) full U S . support and leadership in estab-
      lishing advanced global observation system. Recognizing that research
      in the atmospheric sciences would contribute to the goals of weather
      modification, the committee urged that highest priority be given to
      studies of: atmospheric water budgets, initially on vapor transport
      over US.areas where potential of cloud seeding is important; boundary-
      layer energy-exchangeprocesses; theoretical models of condensation and
      precipitation machines; and meteorological effects of atmospheric pcllu-
      tion, including carbon dioxide. Report strongly urged that appropriate

  Thorough knowledge of cosmic dust, particularly interplanetary dust
    particles near the asteroid belt, was necessary for space engineers to
    successfully design manned and unmanned probes, wrote M. J. S.
    Relton of Kitt Peak National Observatory in Science. He stressed the
    importance of cosmic dust in theoretical and observational astrophysics :
    â€œIt is apparently an important factor in the process of star formation.
    The polarization of starlight which is induced by aligned particles of
    interstellar dust gives information about the magnetic field in galactic
    systems, including our own. . . . In the solar system, the presence of
    dust in planetary atmosphere may lead to misinterpretations of photo-
    metric and polarimetric data that would otherwise give important infor-
    mation about the total mass of the atmosphere. . . . And finally, dust is
    responsible for such interplanetary phenomena as the F corona,
    zodiacal light, gegenschein, and type-I1 comet tails. . . .â€ (Belton,

  NAS Space Science Board issued the first in series of three reports
    entitled Space Research: Directions f o r the Future. Report, prepared at
            request, outlined research objectives for planetary and lunar ex-
    NASAâ€™s
    ploration in 1970-1985. Compiled by working group led by Dr. Gordon
    J. F. MacDonald of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at
    UCLA, Part I repeated NASâ€™ 1964 recommendation that top priority in
    post-Apollo program be assigned to unmanned exploration of Mars.
    Report suggested secondary importance be divided equally between de-
    tailed investigation of lurain and unmanned exploration of Venus, and
    completed priority list with other major planets, comets and asteroids,
    Mercury, Pluto, and interplanetary dust. Major recommendations were:
    launching an orbiting planetary observatory, delivering a drop sonde to
    resolve question of high Venusian surface temperature, developing
    fine-pointing control, accurate to 10 sec. of arc, for rocket guidance, and
    considering enlargement of NASA deep-space communication capabilities
    beyond present plans. To support outlined scientific program, report
    recommended : (1) increasing manpower and facilities available to lunar
    and planetary science programs; (2) development by NASA of substantial
18                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

    program for observation of planets through ground-based telescopes;
    (3) early opportunities for experienced observational scientists to ex-
       ore the lurain; (4) joint study by NASA OSSA and OMSF of early use of
      aturn V for planetary exploration, with special emphasis on a Martian
    capsule landing in the early 1970â€™s; (5) increased attention by NASA to
    development of research and educational capabilities in theoretical
    sciences related to study of the solar system. Regarding funding of space
    research, the report said: rr. . . since we believe that the exploration of
    the solar system bears so directly on the major central scientific ques-
    tions of our time, we anticipate that unmanned experiments will probably
    provide the most significant contribution to the program of planetary
                     .
    exploration . . we recommend that the percentage of support of lunar
    and planetary exploration be maintained over the 1965-1985time period
    and be devoted predominantly to scientific objectives and that programs
    whose objectives are other than scientific be started only as additional
    resources become available.â€ It said there should be a gradual shiâ‚¬t in
    emphasis from the moon to the planets, progressing toward nearly
    equivalent expenditures for lunar and planetary exploration in the 1970-

January 18: U.N. Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space had proposed
    a world conference on outer space to be held in New York. The con-
    ference should examine the impact of space data on education and com-
    munications-issues of major importance even to poor and economically
    retarded states. (NYT, 1/20/66, 12; SBD, 1/31/66, 185)
0 Funeral of Soviet space designer Sergey Korolev was held in Red Square.

    After eulogies by Leonid Smirnov, deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R.
    Council of Ministers; Mstislav Keldysh, President of the U.S.S.R.
    Academy of Sciences; Nikolay Yegorychev, Moscow Gorkom Secretary;
    and Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the funeral procession moved to the
    Kremlin wall where the urn containing Korolevâ€™s ashes was placed in a
    niche.
       Commentary in the New York Times: â€œDeath has finally declassified
    the role and identity of Academician Sergei P. Korolev, the man who
    provided the scientific and technical leadership of the vast Soviet rocket
    program. The extraordinary pomp of his state funeral in Red Square
    contrasted sharply with the almost complete anonymity imposed on him
    while he was alive. In the most fruitful years of his career, the man who
    led the Soviet Unionâ€™s march into the cosmos from the first sputnik to
    Leonovâ€™s â€˜walk in spaceâ€™ was normally referred to in the Soviet press
    only as the mysterious â€˜chief designer.â€™ Korolevâ€™s rockets were powerful
    enough to send men into orbit and to put cameras into position to photo-
    graph the back side of the moon. But they were too weak to break the
    chains of secrecy that denied him, while he lived, the world applause he
    deserved.â€ (Tass, 1/18/66; NYT, 1/20/66, 31)

    launch escape vehicle performance demonstrated; successful canard
    operation caused command module to stabilize in proper attitude. After
    jettison of the Les, the hard part of the boost protective cover, and the
    forward heat shield, command module made safe descent on its three

  Dr. Pyotr Kapitsa, director of the Institute of Physical Problems of the
    Soviet Academy of Sciences, deplored the productivity gap between U S .
    and Soviet science in an article in Komsomolskaya Pravda. He urged
    U.S.S.R. to weed out unproductive research workers periodically: â€œIt
    would . . . be possible to transfer 15 to 20 percent of our staffs from
    science to industry every year and to take into research well-prepared
    and qualified youth. In this manner we would improve the quality of the
    scientific staffs and also not close the door of science in the face of the
    young.â€ He noted that the number of scientific research workers was
    dmost the same in the two countries-800,000 Americans compared
    with 700,000 in the Soviet Union-and said that US. scientists were
    responsible for one third of the worldâ€™s scientific output (in terms of
    research papers published) compared with only one sixth for Soviets.

* NASA Lewis Research Center, first Government laboratory devoted to flight
    propulsion in all its aspects, celebrated its 25th anniversary. Authorized
    by Congress in 1940, the NACA facility was originally called the Aircraft
    Engine Research Lab.; it was renamed the Lewis Flight Propulsion
    Laboratory in 1948 in honor of Dr. George W. Lewis, former NACA
    Director of Aeronautical Research (1924-47). In 1958, when NACA facili-
    ties and personnel were absorbed by the newly created NASA, the facility
    became the Lewis Research Center. From an initial Congressional ap-
    propriation of $2 million in 1941, LRC had emerged as a major research
    and development laboratory valued at $200 million.
       Marking the anniversary, LRC Director Dr. Abe Silverstein said:
    â€œMan isnâ€™t going to be held to a single conquest or success. The past
    decade has seen aviation and rocketry undergo phenomenal change, but
    weâ€™ve just started to realize its potential. The present generation will
    live to fly better than 2,000 mph in commercial aircraft and to observe
         c
    at close range the interplanetary exploits of US. astronauts. The past
    25 years have witnessed truly remarkable strides in aeronautics and
    space activities. In 1941, man had the capability to fly 300 mph and to
    attain altitudes of perhaps 30,000 ft. Today, he orbits the earth at 17,500
    mph and in a few years will set foot on the moon and possibly later
    Mars.â€ (LRC Release 66-1; Lewis News, 1/23/66, 1-12; WI, Miami

January 24: President Johnsonâ€™s message to Congress on the FY I967
    budget said in part: â€œJust over 60 years ago man entered the age of con-
    trolled flight. Today, men orbit the earth at speeds measured in thou-
    sands of miles an hour. In 1967, less than 6 years after this Nation set
    the goal of a manned landing on the moon within the present decade, we
    will begin unmanned test flights of the giant Saturn V rocket and the
    Apollo spacecraft-the complete space vehicle required for achieving
    that goal. Later on in the 1960â€™s, we will undertake the manned lunar
    mission itself.
       CC
         Our many space achievements-both manned and unmanned-have
    dramatically advanced our scientific understanding and technological
    capabilities. They have also demonstrated OUT remarkable progress in
    the peaceful exploration of space. In 1967, our large space projects will
    be progressing from the more expensive development phase into opera-
    tional status, and new projects of equivalent cost will not be started.
    Accordingly, expenditures of the National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
    ministration are estimated to decline by $300 million in 1967 [as opposed
    to the new authorization requested in the FY 1967.budgetI. This level
    will sustain our progress in space exploration and continue the advance-
    ment of science and technology.â€ (Text, CR, 1/24/66,861; Pres. DOC.,

  President Johnson sent FY 1967 budget request to Congress including total
24                ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

    space budget of $6.8 billion. Of this sum, NASA would receive $5.012
    billion (NASA had originally requested $5.58 billion) ; DOD, $1.65 billion;
    AEC, $173.7 million; Environmental Science Services Administration,
    $27 million; and National Science Foundation, $2.8 million.
       NASA R&D program was a major area of reduced expenditure with re-
    duction of approximately$186 million (comparedwithFY 1966appropria-
    tion) mostly absorbed by the sharp drop in requirements for Project
    Gemini. With only three flights remaining to be made in FY 1967, the
    total budget dropped from $226.6 million in FY 1966 to $40.6 million
    requested for FY 1967. Sum included $19.1 million for the spacecraft
    and $8.5 million for mission support. There was also a reduction of some
    $54 million in lunar and planetary exploration and $12 million in physics
    and astronomy. Funding for Project Apollo increased slightly-from
    $2.967 billion in FY 1966 to $2.974 billion, including $1.2 billion for
    spacecraft (as compared with FY 1966â€™s $l.l7-billion level). $100 million
    requested for Apollo Applications (Aa) program-once considered the
    single program with any potential for new major funding-was not
    approved.
       Major portions of the DOD space budget would be spent on develop-
    ment of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol)-which would be slowed
    down with no increase in funds over the $150 million allowed in FY
    1966; development and launch operations costs of the Titan I11 launch
    vehicle; continuation of the reconnaissance and Vela nuclear detection
    satellite programs; navigational satellite launches; and initial launch of
    a satellite by the Defense Communications Satellite System. DOD

    mately $10 million for data acquisition, processing, and archiving.

January 24: NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., said at
    NASA FY 1967 budget briefing that the â€œextremely stringent budgetâ€
     ($5.012 billion) approved by President Johnson and the BOB was the
    result of pressing needs of the Vietnam war and the Great Society.
    Major loser in the NASA budget reduction was the Apollo Applications
     (Aa) program: â€œThe option to go ahead or not [on the Aa program]
    will be made in 1968 [budget],â€ he said. Although NASA had wanted
    $5.58 billion to carry out its FY 1967 program, Seamans said, the $5.012
    billion would make it possible to continue â€˜â€˜a good space programâ€ with
    most of the projects intact. Yet, NASA did â€˜bot have the funds we would
    like to seeâ€ for Apollo. He said the approved FY 1967 Apollo budget of
    $2.974 billion (compared to $2.967 billion in FY 1966) would give the
    US.â€œa chance of lunar landing in this decade,â€ but there were no funds

        Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Deputy Administrator, was principal
    speaker at the Honors Convocation. He said: â€œYesterday, President
    Johnson presented his budget for the coming fiscal year to the Congress.
     ...   This year, the process of sorting out priorities and allocating re-
    sources has been especially difficult. Abroad, there is the growing com-
    mitment to Vietnamese freedom. At home, there is the growing com-
    mitment to freedom from poverty, ignorance, ugliness, and unemploy-
    ment. In addition to these and other commitments, the Presidentâ€™s
    budget once again reiterates the commitment made in 1958 and repeated
    year after year: to undertake the exploration of space for the benefit of
    mankind. Even in a year of extraordinary budget pressures, slightly more
    than $5 billion for NASAâ€™s in this enterprise have been requested. . . .
                               part
        â€œIt is within this framework that the NASA program has been ham-
    mered out-not representing the sum of our program demands. How-
    ever, as we indicated in our budget briefing for the Press this past week-
    end, we believe we have a balanced program of aeronautics and space
    research, of science and technology, of large scale manned exploration
    and unmanned probes and satellites.
        â€œWe recognize there is an enormous responsibility attached to the
    planning, justification, and direction of a sum so large during a period so
    rich in other needs. . . .
        re
          We have reached a point where the exploration of space is no longer
    a promise but a hard fact, where scientific data and tested capabilities
    are in hand instead of in the future.
       â€œ. . . The program that we have laid out for NASA for the coming year
    will meet the highest priorities of scientific and technological needs. It
    will permit flexible evaluation of the next major steps open to us in
    space. It will maintain the forward momentum that has been built up
    with energy and care over the past years. It will permit strong com-
    petition for those who wish to outstrip us and meaningful cooperation
    for those who can find communities of interest with us. It will provide
    an honest and practical balance between the many elements of scientific
    investigation, technological application and operational experience. It
    provides a challenge that will require hard work, hard judgment, and
    careful appraisal at every step of translation from plan into execution. It
                                                                           27

       Tribute to late Dr. Hugh L. Dryden was made at the Honors Convoca-
    tion by L/G James Doolittle (USAFR) : â€œOn the second of December 1965
    the world became poorer; our country lost one of its foresighted leaders;
    aeronautics lost a man who had devoted a major part of his life to its
    advancement; astronautics iost its great ambassador at home and at large
    and those fortunate of us-who had been privileged to know and work
    with him-lost a beloved, revered and respected friend and associate.
       â€œDr. Hugh Latimer Dryden dedicated his whole life to the service of
    his fellow man. He was a doer, but a gentle person-a man who strove
    prodigiously, but instinctively did the kindly thing. He was eager and
    courageous. He had been critically ill for several years, but he worked
                                                              ..
    hard and effectively up to a few days before his death. .
       â€œHugh Latimer Dryden: engineer, scientist, administrator, public
    servant, patriot, theologian, realist. With his immediate family and all
    the nation we, his close friends and associates, mourn his passing. We
    will long remember him with affection, admiration, respect, and grati-
    tude, for excellence endures.â€

    around the concept of a very exhaustive ground test program, with a
    detailed, recorded tracking of the history and experience of every part,
    from the original developer-fabricatorâ€™s plant, through the entire chain
    of subcontractor and contractor activities, to the final, completed article
    on the launch pad. By this thorough and repeated testing under every
    environmental condition that it is possible to simulate, and by under-
    standing and correcting each test failure or performance discrepancy,
    we believe we can achieve the required high reliability whereby we will
    be justified in conducting major missions on the second, third or fourth

  Detailed report on â€œScientific and Engineering Manpower in Communist
     China, 1949-1963,â€ by Dr. Chu-yuan Cheng, of the Univ. of Michigan,
    was made public by NSF. Communist China had been strengthening its
    scientific and engineering fields by putting thousands of students through
    colleges and universities. Yet, these masses of young scientists were
    getting less comprehensive training than older generations of scientists
    and also lacked sufficient experience to engage in top level research. In
                                                                          31

    gaged in basic and creative research. The success or failure in bridging
    the gap between the mass of young scientists and the older scientists
    would determine whether Communist China would become a scienti-
    fically advanced power in the next decade or two, Dr. Cheng said. (Text)

    that the manne lunar landing planned for the end of this decade was
    both economically and scientifically feasible. â€œFurthermore,â€ he
    continued, â€œthe task probably will be accomplished within time and
    money limitations set four years ago. These envisage a moon landing by
    late 1969 at a total cost of about $20 billion.â€ Townes announced the
    appointment of â€œan important ad hoc Science Advisory Committeeâ€
    aimed at obtaining â€œthe most fruitful relationship between NASA and the
    scientific community.â€ Headed by Prof. Norman Ramsey, the new group
    would â€œconsider many . . . problems, concentrating particularly on how
    to carry out the most efficient and rich scientific program and what ways
    will allow the scientific community, including universities, professors,
    and students to participate most easily and effectively in the interesting
    possibilities which are now emerging.â€
       In a panel on the origin and possible death of the universe, P. J. E.
    Peebles and David Wilkinson of Princeton Univ. and Robert W. Wilson
    of Bell Telephone Labs. told about evidence indicating that space was
    permeated by black body radiation. If this were so, it would support the
    â€œbig bangâ€ theory of the origin of the universe which held that at first,
    all was a mass of dense energy; then came expansion powered by much of
    the energy. The original energy would have the properties of the energy
    emitted by a black body-light, heat, and radio waves proportionate to
    its temperature. Because no other explanation existed for the energy
    the Princeton and Bell scientists had detected uniformly distributed
    over space, and because black body characteristics were so clearcut,
    they believed confirmation could be achieved within a year.
       Yuval Neâ€™eman of Tel Aviv Univ. proposed a new theory to explain the
    quasar (quasi-stellar radio source) : the force represented by the tend-
    ency of the universe to expand had been suppressed in some parts of the
    universe; thus, these areas were highly dense. But because this tendency
    is not suppressed under all conditions, it sometimes bursts forth and
    matter tears free of the intense gravitational attractions. When this
    happens, enormous amounts of matter and energy are emitted and
     observers on earth detect the event as a quasar.
       Scientists in a panel discussion on scientific data said the task of
     coping with the scientific information explosion should not become
     exclusively a Government responsibility. Discussion was based on
     December 1965 report of Federal Council for Science and Technology
     recommending that the Government-with participation of private
    groups-establish a national document handling system to help keep
    scientists abreast of new knowledge.

    an increase in total funds for research and development: â€˜â€œrhis down-
    turn in what for about a decade has been a steadily ascending curve

* Possibilities of studying the ocean, its storms, currents, shoals, and
    marine life from orbiting spacecraft were being actively explored by
    the Naval Oceanographic Office in cooperation with the NASA Natural
    Resources Program Office, reported Harold M. Schmeck, Jr., in the New
    York Times. Early studies had included observations that might have
    direct practical usefulness and others that could give man a more
    comprehensive picture of the forces determining climate: photographs
    taken from manned spacecraft at altitudes over 100 mi. could be used
    to correct maps and give accurate indications of water depths over shoals
    and near shore; a global iceberg patrol might be possible from manned
    or unmanned spacecraft; monitoring of sea roughness by radar would be
    useful for shipping; measurements to detect major upwellings of deep
    ocean currents might be valuable to the ocean fishery industry; studies
    of river outflow could be valuable in water pollution control. (Schmeck,
    NYT, 1/29/66,7)
  Close tie between President Johnson and Dr. Donald F. Hornig, Director
    of the Office of Science and Technology (OST) and science adviser to the
    President, was discussed in Science. During the first six or so months of
    Hornigâ€™s term â€œthe President and the White House inner circle had an
    unclear notion of how they might employ OSTâ€ with the result that
     â€œsome of the science staff members complained that they were bored,
34                ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

    and that OST was underemployed or involved with trivia.â€ But a
    transition had taken place, and as Hornig began his third year of service,
    â€œOST and its surrounding bodies-the        Presidentâ€™s Science Advisory
    Committee and the Federal Council for Science and Technology-are
    heavily involved in policy formulation, coordination of the technical
    aspects of the Great Society programs, and troubleshooting in a variety
    of areas.â€ (Science, 1/28/66, 431)
January 28: A â€œcommercial missileâ€ that could transport 170 passengers
    from Bombay to New York in 39 min. was described at the Pacific Area
    Travel Association Conference in New Delhi by B. F. Coggan, corporate
    vice president of Douglas Aircraft Co. He said the rocket-which would
    reach a speed of 17,000 mph-would be a bell-shaped vehicle 114 ft.
    high with a diameter of from 33 to 49 ft. It would weigh more than three
    million pounds at liftoff. Passenger compartment would have 45
    individual passenger couches arranged on each of four decks; during the
    period of weightless flight, passengers would be held to the couches by
    belts. On a typical flight plan, Coggan said, the rocket would reach
    125-mi. peak altitude. Then, it could hover and maneuver horizontally
    before landing on four extendable legs. (NYT, 1/29/66, 54)

0 Many first-rate scientists in the US. did not receive enough financial

    support to allow them to develop their fullest effectiveness in research
    work, NSF Director Dr. Leland J. Haworth said in NSFâ€™S annual report.
     â€œThis lack of support is a detriment to the national scientific capacity,â€
    he added.
        Discussing progress in the biological and medical sciences, the
    report said that science was in the midst of a fourth biological revolu-
     tion. It termed this revolution comparable in importance and ultimate

    knowledge that led to development of agriculture, to understanding of
    infectious disease and its control, and to the understanding of bio-
    logical evolution. Report referrred to current biological research

January 30: Minneapolis Tribune polled 600 Minnesotans on whether US.
     or U.S.S.R. led in space exploration. 79% believed US. was ahead;
     11% gave lead to U.S.S.R. June 1965 poll had indicated that 59%
     thought US. led, while 24% considered U.S.S.R. in front. Increased
     confidence in U.S. position was attributed to success of GEMINI VII-VI
     rendezvous Dec. 15, 1965. 68% thought men could reach the moon
     and return safely, 56% believed US. would be first to do it, and 25%

   President Johnson transmitted his annual Report to the Congress on
     United States Aeronautics and Space Activities, calling 1965 â€œthe most
     successful year in our history.â€ He said in the transmittal letter:
     â€œAs our space program continues, the impact of its developments on
     everyday life becomes daily more evident. It continues to stimulate our
     education, improve our material well being, and broaden the horizons of
     knowledge. It is also a powerful force for peace.â€ He cited US. ac-
     complishments in the Gemini, Ranger, Mariner, and Early Bird pro-
     grams. â€œResearch and development in our space program continued to
     speed progress in medicine, in weather prediction, in electronics-and,
     indeed, in virtually every aspect of American science and technology.â€
     Among chief aeronautical developments report cited â€œdesign refine-
     ment and wind-tunnel testingâ€ of Sst and decision to build C-5A jet
     transport. Among successful US. launches during 1965, DOD had 67
     satellites, 34 of which were unidentified. Military space programs were
     discussed, including Project West Ford; Manned Orbiting Laboratory
      (Mol) ; Initial Defense Communications Satellite Project; and the
     geodetic Secor satellites. Research was under way on the best means
     of determining physical characteristics of â€œuncooperating objects in
     earth orbitâ€ through observation by ground-based radar. The section
     on AEC said that a third pair of Vela radiation-detection satellites
     launched in July 1965 was watching for nuclear explosions in space
     and measuring x-ray emissions from the sun. In a separate chapter
      of the report, the NASC said: â€œThis Nationâ€™s space achievements during
      the year were so distinctive in quality and quantity as to cause people,
      at home and abroad, to conclude the United States had attained the
      space leadership of the world.â€ The Council said that in many respects
      this conclusion was correct â€œbut it would be incorrect and unwise to
      minimize the vitality and size of the space program of the U.S.S.R.â€

During January: Eulogies for the late Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, NASA Deputy
    Administrator, and the late Dr. W. Randolph Lovelace 11, NASA Director
    of Space Medicine, appeared in Air Force an$ Space Digest:
       Walter T. Bonney said of Dr. Dryden: â€œHugh Dryden was a deeply
    religious man. He held that manâ€™s life at its fullest is a trinity of
    activity, physical, mental, and spiritual. Throughout his life he
    preached the compatibility of religion and science, and he lived what
    he preached. No less, he was a realist; and so, as in 1954, he would
    often remind his listeners that: â€˜I am not one of those few who believe
    that we can abolish the use of force in the world. As a nation we
    find it necessary to build great military power. I am confident that
                                                                    . ..
    such strength is a greater contribution to the peace of the world    than
    military weakness.â€™
        â€œIn 1947, he was called to direct the work of the National Advisory
    Committee for Aeronautics. His tasks were enormously difficult-radi-
    cally new and expensive research facilities had to be provided, but
    even more important, learning the nature of the intricate problems of
    flight in the new speed ranges and methods for their solution demanded
    new concepts of team activity and functional coordination. His leader-
    ship, disarmingly light and unobtrusive, was amazingly perceptive and
    effective. Facilities were obtained and changes were made; the period
     1947-58 became what might be truly called NACAâ€™S golden age.
        â€œWith establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Admini-
    stration (of which NACA was the nucleus), he undertook the role of
    scientific leader, reporting to the Administrator, and made of it a
    position of paramount influence. He rejoiced in the US policy that
     activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes and worked
     to promote international space cooperation; but no less, he saw in US
     exploration of space an activity essential to the strength and security
     of the nation. As perhaps never before, his great wisdom and his un-
     excelled mastery of the art of the possible were in those later years
     valued and used to their fullest.â€
        Editor John Loosbrock said of Dr. Lovelace: â€œIn widening circles,
     the full import of Randyâ€™s untimely death becomes apparent. The Air
     Force Association and the Aerospace Education Foundation have lost a
     distinguished leader. The medical profession is poorer for the passing
     of a brilliant surgeon, an imaginative researcher. The United States
     Air Force will miss his sound advice and pioneering efforts in the
     special kind of medical knowledge that is required for those who fly-in
     air and in space. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
     must find new leadership for its space medical effort. The entire
     nation and the world itself will find that Randy Lovelaceâ€™s death leaves
     a large and well-nigh unfillable niche.â€ (AFISD, 1/66)

During January: Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, Special Assistant to NASA
     Administrator, paid tribute to the late Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, in Applied
     Mechanics Reviews on Dr. Drydenâ€™s scientific and engineering accom-
     plishments. Dr. Bisplinghoff noted that the NACA, under Dr. Drydenâ€™s
     leadership, â€˜â€˜produced a vast body of new knowledge which made possi-
     ble routine supersonic flight and laid much of the ground for space
     flight that was to come. We discern here, perhaps as much as any other
     place, the impact of Drydenâ€™s leadership on the nationâ€™s destiny. The
     development of high-speed wind-tunnel facilities and a companion
     competence for theoretical research within the NACA contributed, in
     the opinion of the author, more than any other single factor to the
     leadership of the United States in supersonic flight. . . .â€ (AMR, 1/66,

0 An air-transport vehicle that had attracted the special interest of NASA

     aeronautics research was the personal airplane, Charles Harper, Director
     of Aeronautics Div., NASA OART, wrote in Astronautics & Aeronautics.
     Attempts were being made to devise aircraft whose control commands
     would provide a response â€œwholly natural to the operatorâ€ and which
     could be operated with no more special training than required for the
     automobile. Recent scientific developments spurred by spaceflight
     activity were being assessed with regard to the problem. (Harper,

   In Readerâ€™s Digest article, William Hines, science editor of the Washington
     Evening Star, charged and documented what he described as a banding
     â€œtogether in a unique alliance, [of] NASA and the Urban Renewal
     Administrationâ€ to build NASA Electronics Research Center in Cam-
     bridge, Mass., at the cost of several citizensâ€™ rights. He said: â€œIt was a
     splendid arrangement. The glamor of a Federal space center would
     grease the way for urban renewal which, realistically, didnâ€™t otherwise
      stand a chance of tearing up this thriving industrial area. NASA had
      captured a prize piece of real estate at a bargain-basement price-
      roughly $4 million-thanks to the fact that urban renewal would pay
      most of the â€˜realâ€™ cost of the land and would take on the expense and
      dirty work of removing the occupants. And the Cambridge-Boston area
      was going to have all that money spent there.
         â€œThere was only one catch: nobody had bothered to ask the opinion

    know and understand in order to build a new society . . So research,
    as research, is an important goal, and in accomplishing it we end up
    supporting two-thirds of all the research going on in the graduate
    schools of the country. . . . Weâ€™re supporting some 26,000 students a
    year, indirectly, through research grants. And now through direct
    federal grants and fellowships weâ€™re supporting a little more than that

    increase in R&D performance funds from $6.6 billion in 1956 to $13.4
    billion in 1964. Report attributed 17% of increase to the electrical
    equipment and communication industry, noting that performance of
    R&D in those two fields was â€œstrongly influenced by the requirements
    of the Federal Government in the areas of defense and space explora-
    tion.â€ Only those two industries received more Federal than company
    financing for R&D; in 1964, 90% of aircraft and missile industryâ€™s R&D
    funds came from Federal Government, and 62% of those of the electrical
    equipment and communication industry. Aircraft and missile industry
    employed 30% of total number of R&D scientists and engineers;
    January 1965 figure of 101,200 for these personnel showed decline
    of 7,700 from January 1964. Electrical equipment and communication
    industry accounted for 22% of total-74,800 scientists and engineers

    research, Dr. Woollard called on Congress to assess the overall scientific
    needs of the country, including â€œambitiousâ€ programs in various fields
    proposed by NSF and NAS panels. â€œResearch proposals that were good
    enough five years ago to obtain NSF support now would not stand a

February 1: Two large telescopes orbiting 20,000 mi. above earth and oc-
    casionally requiring man to service them in space should be the ultimate
    goal for the national program in space astronomy, according to Space
    Research: Directionsfor the Future (Part 11), second report of NAS Space
    Science Boardâ€™s Summer Study (Woods Hole, Mass., 1965). Report,
    compiled by a working group of astronomers headed by Dr. George P.
    Woollard, Univ. of Hawaii, said 120-in.-dia. optical telescope and radio-
    telescope with extended aperture of 12 mi. would aid study of many
    basic scientific problems in astronomy. It recommended that NASA sup-
    port, in addition to Orbiting Astronomical Observatories (Oao) and
    Orbiting Solar Observatories (Oso) : more rapid growth of ground-
    based solar astronomy in accordance with 10-yr. projection of needs for
    large optical and radiotelescopes contained in a 1964 report by the
    Academy; specialized instrumentation for ground-based solar astron-
    omy; doubling of sounding rocket launches for research in optical, solar,
    and x-ray and gamma-ray astronomy and for improvements in their
    guidance and flight stability; laboratory studies for more efficient detec-
    tion and recording of radiation in all readings of the electromagnetic
    spectrum; substantial increases in balloon flights for radar and for x-ray
    and gamma-ray astronomy; and development of systems to reach
    altitudes higher than present 100,000- to 150,000-ft. limit for balloon-
    borne payloads. (Text; NAS Release)
  Surveyor soft-landing retrorocket system was successfully tested by
    Hughes Aircraft Co. and JPL at Holloman AFB. After test vehicle was re-
    leased from balloon at 1,450-ft. altitude, three throttlable liquid engines
     operated by terminal descent guidance systemâ€™s radar and autopilot
     control slowed vehicle to simulated landing 500 ft. above ground, par-
    tially demonstrating performance required to softland on the moon.
    Three engines were then shut down and parachute system deployed to
    lower vehicle to ground. In actual mission, Surveyor would cut off its
     engines 13 ft. above moonâ€™s surface and free-fall remainder of distance

February 3: ESSA I (Tiros OT-3), first meteorologicalsatellite in Tiros Opera-
    tional Satellite (Tos) series, was launched from ETR for Environmental
    Science Services Administration (ESSA) by NASA with three-stage Thor-
    Delta booster into nearly polar, sun-synchronous orbit to provide cloud
    coverage of entire sunlit portion of the earth at least once daily. Before
    achieving orbit, spacecraft performed three precise â€œdoglegâ€ ma-
    neuvers initiated by airborne autopilot system, injecting it into orbit:
    apogee, 523 mi. (842 km.) ;perigee, 433 mi. (697 km.) ;period, 100 min.;
    inclination, 97.9â€. During first orbit, ESSA I was spin-stabilized at 10
    rpm with spin axis in plane of orbit. Entering second orbit, spacecraft
    responded to ground control command to begin turning on its side into
    cartwheel position. Maneuver was expected to be completed 24 hrs.
    after launch; television cameras would be turned on 36 hrs. after launch.
    Cartwheel shaped, ESSA I contained two W-in. vidicon cameras mounted
    180â€ apart on each side so they could view earth every six seconds.
    Camera system could send pictures directly to command and data ac-
    quisition stations at NASA Wallops Station and Gilmore Creek, Alaska,
    or store photos on its tape recorder for readout when satellite passed
    within 1,500-mi. radius of a ground station.
       ESSA I (Environmental Survey Satellite No. 1) was 11th successful
    Tiros (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) to be launched by
    NASA in 1 attempts. It was first of two Tos operational meteorological
               1
    satellites planned and financed by ESSA to provide daily cloud-cover
    pictures to ground stations on a global basis. ESSA (at that time US.
    Weather Bureau) had also funded TIROS x (OT-1), launched by NASA
    July 2, 1965. (NASA Proj. O f ;ESSA Release 66-7; UPI, NYT, 2/4/66, 37)

  First soft-landing on moon was made by U.S.S.R. when LUNA IX spacecraft
    softlanded an instrument package near Ocean of Storms west of the
    Reiner and Marius craters. Instrument package began relaying tele-
    metric signals to earth immediately and Tass said â€œinformation re-

    LUNA IX was oriented vertically to the moon. At 77-km. (47-mi.) altitude,
    48 sec. before touchdown, radar system aimed at lunar surface turned
    on the retrorocket and shock-absorbing system was prepared. Less than
    one second before impact, after spacecraft had been slowed to less than
    10 mph, instrument capsule was ejected. Rocket crashed and 4 min.
    10 sec. after instrument capsule had landed, its petal-like covering and
    antennas opened and radio transmissions began.
       Jodrell Bank Experimental Station announced LUNA IX had transmitted
    facsimile pictures of the moon from the time it landed at 1:45 p.m. EST
    until 2:05 p.m. EST, gone off the air, and then resumed signals shortly
    after 9:OO p.m. EST. Soviet spokesman declined to confirm report.

February 4: Soviet officials acknowledged that LUNA IX photos were being
    received in U.S.S.R. and said first LUNA IX photo would appear in Feb. 5
    edition of Zzvestia. (Wash. Post, 2/5/66, A6)
  Two photographs of the moon produced at Jodrell Bank Experimental
    Station by feeding radio transmissions from LUNA IX into newspaper
    telephoto machine were shown on British television. Each picture took
    eight minutes to receive and was recorded at 100 lines to one inch for
    finished 10-by 11-in. photo. Sir Bernard Lovell, station director, said in
    a television interview that photos â€œseem to destroy the theory that the
    moonâ€™s surface is covered with dust several feet thick. There may be a
    few inches of dust, but the pictures tend to confirm the view of the
    moonâ€™s surface as hard, spongelike pumice stone substance.
       â€œIt would be perfectly satisfactofl for landing not only heavy
    vehicles but also men.â€
       Lovell ointed out rock-like pinnacles estimated to be 10- to 20-ft.

    tall; smal stones, some less than one inch in diameter; the curved
    horizon of the moon; and sharp shadows which indicated the sun was
    casting the shadow. He emphasized, however, necessity of knowing the
    pro er scale before photos could be meaningfully interpreted. Lovell
       B
    sai LUNA IX had landed in a location which would receive sunlight for
    14 days, thereby permitting solar power to replenish its batteries.

    Laboratory, told the New York Times in a telephone interview that he
    thought from photos released by Jodrell Bank Experimental Station
    LUNA M was resting in a shallow crater and the 10- to 20-ft.-high rocks
    described by Sir Bernard Lovell were the result of distorted foreshorten-
    ing of the most distant rocks and features. (Sullivan, NYT, 2/5/66, 1,

  US. space officials did not feel that LUNA IXâ€™S successful soft-landing on
    the moon indicated US. was behind U.S.S.R. in the â€œmoon race,â€
    reported John Wilford in the New York Times. Vice President Humphrey,
    NASC Chairman, told Wilford in an interview that â€˜(so many systems and
    programs are involved that it is very difficult to say whoâ€™s ahead and
    whoâ€™s behind.â€ Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Deputy Administrator,
    admired the Sovietsâ€™ â€œsolid, aggressive and expandingâ€ space program
                                                                           45

    and conceded that although US. program was broader-based â€œthe Rus-
    sians are awfully good at picking goals and going after them.â€ Wilford
    said US. space officials were unwilling to speculate on who would make
    first manned lunar landing, but foresaw no significant changes in U.S.
    program because of LUNA IXâ€™S success. Dr. Seamans said Surveyor proj-
    ect would not be curtailed and could not be speeded up: â€œWeâ€™ve got to
    gather our own data because we canâ€™t count on the Russians to release
    their own data. Besides, we want to land in other places on the moon.
    Hopefully, we can exchange data with the Russians.â€ (Wilford, NYT,
    2/5/66, 11)
February 4: International scientific community commented on LUNA IXâ€™S soft-
    landing on the moon. Dr. William Pickering, Director of JPL, offered
    congratulations and said: â€œThe difficulty of the task is attested to by
    the number of previous attempts to accomplish a soft landing on the
    moon. The success of this mission has already added to our knowledge
    of the lunar surface. We now await with interest the scientific data
    which will be received in the next few days.â€ Heinz Kaminski, chief of
    Bochum Observatory, West Germany: â€œAmerican space flight tech-
    nology is on a high level of perfection which the Russians just canâ€™t
    match.â€ Dr. L. R. Shepherd, president of British Interplanetary Society:
       [Soft-landing on the moon is] much more difficult than the orbit ren-
    dezvous achieved by the Americans.â€ Dr. Shotaro Miyamoto, chief of
    Kyoto Univ. astronomical observatory, Japan: â€œSoviet landing means
    men and materials will now be sent to the moon and its development
    accelerated.â€ (NYT, 2/5/66, 11; 2/6/66, E l l )
  International press commented on LUNA IXâ€™S soft-landing on the moon.
    New York Times: â€œTwo facts indicate the magnitude of the advance that
    has now been made. One is the known failure of four earlier Soviet
    rockets to make the soft landing finally achieved by Luna 9. The second
    is the unhappy history of efforts in this country to build the Surveyor
    vehicle, which is intended to perform moon reconnaissance of the type
     in which the Soviet ship is pioneering. The Surveyor project is currently
    far behind schedule. The first fight is not planned until later this year,
     and it is impossible even to forecast when a Surveyor will duplicate the
     soft landing of Luna 9.
        â€œThe whole process demonstrates again the wastefulness of the
     Soviet-American moon race. Were the United States and Russia co-
     operating fully, rather than competing, the hundreds of millions of
     dollars spent on Surveyor would have been applied to progress in fields
     still inadequately explored by either country.â€
        Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo: â€œIt is possible to say that the Soviet Union
     is considerably ahead of the U S . in the moon development program. It
     is regrercable that the two nations have failed to exchange information
     and technology for the development of outer space.â€
        La Nazione, Florence: â€œIf the Russians already know how to land on
     the moon, they still donâ€™t know how to effect a crendezvousâ€™ in orbit.
     The inverse holds, naturally, for the Americans. This means that both
     are still faced by formidable problems and that the great contest is still
     open.â€
        Times o India, Bombay: â€œAt this rate it is not unreasonable to pre-
                f
     sume that a Russian-manned probe will land on the moon and return
     in about a year from now, beating the Americans to it by about three
     years.â€ (NYT, 2/6/66, E l l )

    spacecraft was an airtight package carrying radio system, program-
    timer, thermal-regulation system, power-supply sources, and television
    system ensuring 360â€ view of the landscape. Antennas mounted on out-
    side of craft were set to open automatically after it had settled on lunar
    surface. Complete with shock-absorbingsystem and metal screens shaped
    like petals to protect it during touchdown, 220-lb. instrumented payload
    detached itself from engine immediately before landing, and two units
    landed at some distance from each other.
       Anatoli A. Blagonravov, chairman of the Soviet Commission for
    Ex loration and Use of Outer Space, was critical of Jodrell Bankâ€˜s
    pubplication of LUNA IX photos and said that Jodrell Bank lacked the cor-
    rect vertical and horizontal scales: â€œThe horizontal scale of the British
    photographs had been shrunk by approximately 2.5 times.â€
       Photos released by MOSCOW,      vivid in detail and contrast, showed a
    landscape less pinnacled and strange than that in British versions.

  Mstislav Keldysh, president of Soviet Academy of Sciences; Alexander
    Lebedinsky, .professor; and Alexander Vinogradov, geochemist, held
    2%-hr. televised press conference in Moscow on the LUNA IX mission.
    KeIdysh said U.S.S.R. had mastered the soft-landing technique and was
    planning more soft-landing missions in 1966 to obtain information on
    physical conditions on the moon, composition of lunar rock, and varia-
    tions in lunar temperature. He said the next major challenge would
    be designing a spacecraft capable of returning men to earth from the
    moon and called for US. â€œcooperation not competitionâ€ in a program
    for manned lunar landing. LUNA IXâ€™S mission was â€œonly to photograph
    the surface of the moon and measure cosmic radiation,â€ Keldysh said.
    The full panorama of the lunar surface included 6,000 lines and was
    transmitted to earth in 100 min. Spacecraft contained no solar bat-
    teries.
       Lebedinsky revealed that LUNA IX had â€œshifted between the second
    and third transmissions of the panorama, and as a result, the inclination
    of the phototelevision camera changed several degrees, while the camera
    itself shifted its position several centimeters.â€ Keldysh added: â€œIt may
    be that the station landed on an unstable small stone, or perhaps the
    ground settled slightly. Such a very small deformation could occur
    because of temperature changes on the moon or a certain mechanical
                                                                            51

    impact by the station itself." He expressed confidence that the lunar
    surface could support manned spacecraft.
       Lebedinsky said LUNA IX had measured rate of radiation in outer space
    at 30 millirads a day and that the spacecraft had detected additional radi-
    ation on lunar surfaceapparently produced by nuclear reactions from
    cosmic rays hitting moon's upper layers-but he did not disclose
    amount. Vinogradov reported that lunar surface was hard, porous,
    volcanic cracked rock, but acknowledged that other areas might be
    different. Keldysh announced that VENUS XI and VENUS 111 spacecraft,
    launched Nov. 12 and Nov. 16, 1965, respectively, were scheduled to
    approach Venus March 1. (Wmh. Post, 2/11/66; Balt. Sun, 2/11/66;

    June 16-19, 1963, discussed problems of flight to the moon in Aviatsiya

    launch directly from earth with a very powerful carrier rocket to provide
     escape speed for a huge payload including the spacecraft and facilities
    for return flight; (2) a launch from earth orbit with separately fueling
    low-power rockets orbiting the lunar spacecraft; (3) a landing from an
     orbit near the moon (such as that planned for US. Apollo project)
    which would â€œinsure more dependable contact between landing capsule
     and the main ship.â€ Bykovsky said work â€œis in full swingâ€ to design

  NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications
    Edgar M. Cortright, testifying before the House Committee on Science
    and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications,
    stressed importance of selectivity in planning space science program:
    â€œWe have been looking at Apollo applications for some time to identify
    those areas of scientific activity where the man can be a real asset to the
    experiment, and the areas that interest us most are astronomy; natural
    resources, which is looking down at the Earth with various types of
    detectors; biology, which is concerned with long-duration weightless
    flight, from both a fundamental biological point of view and in prepara-
    tion for longer flights; and, of course, continued lunar exploration.
            ...
       Ct
             man is not an asset in space science experiments in all cases. You
    have to be extremely selective to find those cases where he will be an
    asset, and they do exist. We think that astronomy in the seventies is one
    such area; also biology, Earth resources, and continued lunar explora-
    tion. But in the particles and fields work it is unlikely that man will be an
    asset, and it is unlikely that he will play the major role in applications
    where what we really want is long lifetime.â€ (NASA Auth. Hearings,
    57-8)
  NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E.
    Mueller told the Business Council in Washington, D.C., that â€˜â€˜so far as

    weâ€™re â€œat our peak in total manpower costs.â€ He added: â€œOne of the
    anomalies of the space program is that we must begin to â€˜go out of
    businessâ€™ before we fly our first operational vehicle. . . . By the time
    manned flights begin, the employment level will be quite low in com-
                                                          . .â€
    parison with the peak, which occurred in 1965. .
       Commenting on post-Apollo plans, he said: â€œThe budget for the
    coming fiscal year permits NASA to hold open the option for a program to
    procure additional flight vehicles beyond those now programmed, SO as
    to employ the Apollo hardware and capabilities at least through 1971.
    If we do not exercise this option, in the decision for the [FYI 1968
    budget we will have to begin a phase down of the manned space flight
    activities and the â€˜mothballingâ€™ of some of our facilities.â€ (Text)

    drag-and in the pounds of propellant required to keep the station in its
    assigned orbit. An unmanned scientific or defense system which has to
    operate close to the Earth will similarly have the advantage of low

  Use of personal radar units by astronauts to counteract optical illusions
    which they might encounter while assembling a space station or explor-
    ing the moon was recommended by Cambridge Univ. Prof. Richard L.
    Gregory, author of Eye and Brain: The Psychology of Seeing, in a New
    York press interview. Gregory believed astronauts might experience
    spatial distortion when seeing spacecraftâ€™s srructural elements gleaming
    luminously in sunlight or sharply etched against a jet black background.
    In addition, he thought they might experience reversed depth perception
    which would cause distorted images. Gregory recommended aiding astro-
    nauts with tones, heard through earphones, of a variable pitch which
    would be determined by a beam from radar unit each man would wear.
    Variations in pitch would indicate distance to different objects and
    astronautâ€™s rate of approach or retreat from them. Gregory was conduct-

    entered lunar vehicle simulator to begin 14- to 21-day final laboratory
    validation tests on interior chamber d&gn and investigation of human
    factors of an enclosed cabin environment. Cabin, 10-ft. cylinder with
    7-ft. diameter and 5-ft. ceiling, had stations for performing various
    tasks-eating, sleeping, taking sample measurements, and completing
    geophysical assignments. Study, conducted by Honeywell, Inc., under
    NASA Office of Advanced Research and Technology (OART) sponsorship,
    would determine: (1) functional relationships between physiological re-
    sponses and behavior and the time required to perform assigned tasks; (2)
    how to design lunar roving vehicles to provide crew mobility and utilize
    cabin space; and (3) how to increase proficiency in performing required
    tasks during extended lunar exploration. Engineers would be isolated

    control and geological survey searches for fuel and minerals, could also
    be handled from space. (M&R, 2/28/66,9, 12)

    ments have shown that rapid starts and restarts can be made and that
    operation is stable over a wide range of conditions.
        â€œOn February 3, 1966, we made the first power run with a complete
    nuclear rocket engine system. Although the major components were
    spread out and connected in a â€˜breadboardâ€™ fashion, the system started
    and operated as a unit with no external power. On February 11, the

    is important to note that the Mariner IV photographs do not determine
    whether life exists on Mars. Even before the flight of Mariner IV, it was
    known that pictures taken at this resolution could not give any direct
    evidence of life forms. . . .
       â€œWe propose to continue the exploration of Venus and Mars begun
    so well with Mariners I1 and IV, respectively, by utilizing for the 1967
    Venus op ortunity an appropriate modification of the spare spacecraft
              K
    from the ariner IV program. This will be launched on an Atlas-Agena
    vehicle.â€
       Cortright presented prepared statement by Associate Administrator
    for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell summarizing
    comsat and sounding rocket launches: â€œThe first launching by NASA of a
    satellite for the Corporation [ComSatCorp] took place on April 6, 1965,
    when the Early Bird satellite was placed in orbit using a thrust-aug-
    mented Delta launch vehicle. The launching was carried out under an
    agreement between Comsat and NASA, signed in December 1964, which
    detailed the services to be performed by NASA, financial arrangements,
             .
    etc. . .
       â€œAlthough the original agreement gave Comsat options for as many
    as seven additional launchings through March 1967, none of these
    options has been exercised. In the meantime, Comsat has inaugurated
    the HS-303A program, and has advised NASA that it will require two or
    three HS-303A launchings in 1966, beginning in August. The HS-303A
    is larger and heavier than Early Bird, and will need the capabilities of
    the thrust-augmented improved Delta launch vehicle. Otherwise,
    launch services are expected to be similar to those provided in support
    of the Early Bird.
       â€œThe Corporation is now negotiating for development and procure-
    ment of spacecraft for the eventual global system. These spacecraft are
    expected to be deployed beginning in 1968.â€
       Referring to the NASA sounding rocket program, Dr. Newell said:
    â€œSince 1959 to the present NASA has launched 668 sounding rockets for
    scientific investigations in space and 516 of these were for investigations
    in the areas of physics and astronomy.â€ He mentioned as significant the
    International Quiet Sun Year (IQSY) Mobile Launch Expedition carried
    out in spring 1965 using an aircraft carrier as a launching platform:
    rockets carrying instrumented payloads were launched off west coast of
    South America from 5â€ north latitude to 60â€ south latitude with the
       eatest concentration of Eghts at the geomagnetic equator near Lima,

    need for close coordination between scientific groups within Govern-
    ment, he said: â€œRecognizing the Air Force interest in hypersonic flight,
    a proposal was made to the Air Force Systems Command Headquarters
    that the two agencies prepare a single coordinate program representing
    a national effort in hypersonic technology with each agency supporting
    that portion most appropriate to its capabilities. The proposal was
     accepted. . . . Technical approval of general plans is through the NASA
     OART Office and the AFSC RTD Office and generation and coordination of
    program details are developed through appointed technical groups from

     aids. Awls would program aircraftâ€™s flight path, speed, angle of approach,
     and attitude; generate and provide data to pilot or autopilot; and be
     nearly self-sufficient. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. had been contracted by

February 28:     ESSA 11 (Tos OT-2), second meteorological satellite in Tiros
      Operational Satellite (Tos) system, was launched by NASA from ETR
      for ESSA with three-stage Thor-Delta booster. Launch vehicle performed
      three â€œdoglegâ€ maneuvers before injection into near-polar, near-circular,
      sun-synchronous orbit. Initial orbital parameters : apogee, 885 mi.
       (1,425 km.); perigee, 843 mi. (1,357 km.); period, 113.5 min.; inclina-
      tion, 101.16â€.
         A cylindrical, 18-sided polygon, 290-lb. ESSA 11 was equipped with two
      Automatic Picture Transmission (Apt) camera systems for photograph-
      ing local cloud cover. During first orbit, spacecraft was spin-stabilized
      at 10.9 rpm with bottom of spacecraft toward earth; during second orbit,
      orientation maneuvers initiated by ground command began to turn
      satellite on its side; after 18 orbits-approximately 33 hrs. after launch
      -ESSA 11 would be in cartwheel position. Combination of cartwheel con-
      figuration and near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit would permit 100%
      photographic coverage of earthâ€™s cloud cover during daylight hours with
      a given area photographed at the same local time each day. Primary
      objective of ESSA 11 (Environmental Survey Satellite No. 2) flight was to
      provide direct readout to worldwide network of Apt receiving stations.
          ESSA financed, managed, and operated the Tos systems. GSFC managed
      NASA participation in the project. Tracking operations were responsibility
      of STADAN. First satellite in Tos system, ESSA I, was launched Feb. 3.

    NASA Administrator James E. Webb, testifying before the Senate Committee
e
      on Aeronautical and Space Sciences as it began hearings on NASAâ€™s FY
       1967 budget authorization, said U.S.S.R. would become unchallenged
      leader in space exploration unless US. soon decided to support post-
      Apollo missions. Webb reviewed U.S.S.R.â€™s very active year in space
      and said: â€œMore important to us than any other indication from Soviet
      space activity is the clear commitment to a long-term effort. The fact that
      they are making such a commitment shows the importance they attach
      to advancing their capabilities in space. Unless we soon decide to follow
      through with a strong program in the years after we have achieved a
      manned lunar landing, we cannot avoid a gap in our flight schedule
      while they forge ahead as the unchallenged contestant in the field.â€
          Webb noted FY 1967 budget for NASA reflected a Presidential decision
       â€œto hold open for another year decisions which cannot be delayed
      beyond the period of the FY 1968 budget.â€™â€™ He added: â€œThe programs
      we are now carrying out so successfully, the new knowledge we are
      acquiring so rapidly, the ending of the period of uncertainty as to what
      both Russian Cosmonauts and American Astronauts can achieve in
      space, and the growing utilization of the long term values that our
      investments have created in reliable launch vehicles, spacecraft, and
      assembly test and launch complexes, all point toward decisions to
      use rather than lose the values we have worked so hard and spent so
      much to create. And so I believe that our presentation of this 1967
      Budget marks not just assertion to you that we have built well as we
      have created a foundation for space power, but also marks the beginning
      of a momentous era in which we must decide how we will use this power
      in future years.â€

    space program is this demonstration of national capability in science
    and technology. That we have this capability is no longer a matter of
    opinion but a demonstrated fact that is clear to all who concern them-
    selves with the power nations can and do develop for many purposes
    from the mastery of a new environment or a new technology. We have
    put it on view for all the world to see. The world knows today that the
    United States can digest the space-related problems of long lead-times,
    can hold its position in a demanding competition, and can forge ahead
    simultaneously in both aeronautics and space and in those advanced
    technologies of which space is the leading symbol.â€ (NASA Auth.

    C. Seamans, Jr., said: â€œWe are presenting the budget that reflects our best
    balancedprovision for four essential priorities,priorities which must rank
    together as the core of the NASA program: The need to press forward
    the development of the Nationâ€™s capability for major Manned Space
    Flight operations, to be demonstrated by a manned lunar landing within
    this decade.
        â€œThe need to continue those important projects in space sciences and
    space applications that are already underway and that have already made
    such valuable contributions to our fundamental understanding of the
    universe and to the use of space systems for human benefit.
        â€œThe need to maintain the flow of advanced research and technology
    effort that is at the heart of the Nationâ€™s ability to undertake future
    projects in aeronautics and space explorations.
        â€œThe need to take certain steps now to avoid an otherwise certain
    gap in future space capabilities and achievements.â€ (NASA Auth.

     reported that in 1965 â€œthere were 18successful orbits out of 20 attempts
     for a 90% success record.â€ Looking to the future, Newell said: â€œin
     order to assure that the launch vehicle space transportation evolves
                                                                    .
     a logical and economical fashion for the more demanding. .missions
     which are beyond the capability of present vehicles, it is essential that
     some effort continuously be put into advanced studies of future vehicles
     and into some of the critical launch vehicle technoIogy areas.â€
        He described research in behavioral biology, outlining prospective
     experiment to determine whether for pocket mice in earth orbit
      â€œcircadian rhythm of either temperature or locomotion changes when
     all geophysical variables other than light and temperature are either
     removed or sensed by the animals with a period of about 90 minutes
      (orbital period) instead of 24 hours.â€
         By the end of FY 1966, NASAâ€™s    sustaining university program would
     be supporting 64 projects at 54 institutions throughout US.,Dr. Newell
      testified. In FY 1967 it would support approximately 70 projects at 60
      universities at a cost of $12 million. It was expected that 3,681 students
      would be in the predoctoral training element of the program by Septem-
     ber 1966 and the number of participating universities would be 152.

     ability of the Saturn V booster, as well as success of Saturn IB missions:
     â€œWe plan to end the series at Apollo-207 if the Saturn V is available

     the Apollo-208 and 209 missions.â€ (Taylor, M&R, 2/28/66, 17)
0 Joint Chiefs of Staff believed U.S.S.R. was accomplishing much more in

    advanced weaponry than Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara was
    giving them credit for, reported Aviation Week. Gen. John P. McConnell,
     USAF Chief of Staff, was said to be especially concerned about Soviet
     developments in antimissile missiles and their radars, maneuverable
     warheads for ICBMS, military space systems, and advanced aircraft.
     During hearings on the FY 1966 budget, General McConnell had said the
     decision on whether to proceed with full-scale development of the
     advanced manned strategic aircraft (Amsa) should be made in FY 1967.
     Aviation Week pointed out McNamara did not make that decision in the
     the FY 1967 budget and dropped Amsa one category-from engineering
     development to advanced development. Also, in a posture statement
     before the Senate Armed Services Committeeâ€™s Defense Appropriations
     Subcommittee, McNamara appeared to contradict Secretary of the Air
    Force Dr. Harold Brownâ€™s view that the FB-111 was only a stop-gap
     bomber until Amsa was approved. Comparison of Boeing B-52C through
    F models, McNamara reportedly said, showed â€œthe FB-111 is not an
     interim aircraft but is, indeed, a truly effective strategic bomber.â€

    electrostatic thrustors began in 1958. In the early thrustor models,
    power efficiencies and propellant-utilization efficiencies were 20-30%;
    lifetimes did not exceed a few hours; ion-current densities were less than
    1 milliamp/cmZ; the probIem of beam neutralization was unsolved-
    was not even well understood. Mission applications seemed far in the
    future. Today, only seven years later, electrostatic thrustors are very
    close to flight readiness. Two systems, the ion-bombardment system
    and the surface-ionization system, have reached power efficiencies and
    propellant efficiencies above 90%; they produce ion currents of about
    20 milliamp/cm2. Beam neutralization has proven in the laboratory as
    well as in actual s ace tests, and engine lifetimes of several-thousand
                       ;P
    hours have been emonstrated. With a few more years of refinement
    and quality engineering, these ion thrustors will be ready for extended

  Commenting on national space goals in the post-Apollo period, Henry
    Simmons said in Astronautics & Aeronautics: â€œNASA over the past year
    quietly shifted its emphasis from an AAP exploiting already financed
    Apollo hardware for alternate missions to a much vaster AAP involving
     outlays on the scale of the Apollo lunar effort itself to support an in-
    tensive follow-on effort extending perhaps to 1975. Some NASA Centers
    engaged in the Apollo program, and particularly the Marshall Space
    Flight Center, are already confronted with the prospect of unemploy-
    ment among their most skilled andvaluable design personnel. â€˜We are right
    now in the position where over the next six months the engineers who
    did the original design on the Saturn and probably a year from now
    those who did it on the Apollo will be out of work,â€™ NASA Administrator

    planet, Tass announced. Observers believed the 2,116-lb. spacecraft,
    launched Nov. 16, 1965, had crash-landed. â€œRegular radio communica-
    tions,, had been maintained with VENUS 111 throughout the flight but
    were lost as the probe approached the planet; no telemetric data were
    received in final moments before impact. Announcement said com-
    panion spacecraft VENUS 11, launched Nov. 12, 1965, had passed within
    14,900 mi. of Venus Feb. 27, and was continuing in solar orbit. (Later,

    ducted through the work of the automatic stations Venus 2 and 3 allowed
    the solution of a number of absolutely new tasks of interplanetary flights
    and the obtaining of new scientific data,â€ Tass said. Manâ€™s closest
    previous contact with Venus had occurred Dec. 14, 1962, when NASAâ€™s
    MARINER 1 (launched Aug. 27, 1962) had passed 21,648 mi. from its

    said VENUS 111 carried pennant bearing Soviet coat of arms to the
    Venusian surface. Further details of the spacecraftâ€™s instrumentation
    were to be revealed later [see March 51.

 The Feb. 28 deaths of Astronauts Elliot M. See, Jr., and Charles A.
    Bassett I1 received editorial comment.
       Washington Evening Star: â€œYesterdayâ€™s tragedy is all the more

       Houston Post: â€œThere is . an element of irony in the fact that two
    men preparing for a highly hazardous space mission should die in this
    prosaic manner, but actually, under the procedures that are followed
    in space flights, there are just as great risks on the surface of the earth
    and in its atmosphere as in space, and they probably are much more
    numerous. If air travel is safer than land travel today, space travel is
    probably even safer . . .â€ (Houston Post, 3/2/66)
       Missiles and Rockets: â€œBy emphasizing the everyday risk taken by all
    the astronauts in the course of training, the deaths of Capt. Freeman,
    Mr. See and Maj. Bassett have almost certainly lessened the outcry
    against the space program in the event of similar losses during space
    operations.
       â€œEach time an astronaut steps into a military jet aircraft, he is running

    a risk perceptibly greater than that he takes in space. . . [NASA] takes
    the greatest of care to assure that manned spacecraft launches are as
    safe as the best engineering talent in the nation can make them. A
    launch atop a Titan 11, hazardous as it may be, cannot compare with
    the danger inherent in groping through low fog for an elusive runway
    in a jet aircraft.â€ (Coughlin, M&R, 3/14/66, 54)

    of a whole family of celestial objects was reported by Naval Research
    Laboratory physicist Dr. Herbert Friedman at a news conference in
    Washington, D.C. The two galaxies-Cygnus A and M-87-were among
    the strongest of the 10,000 galaxies that emit radio signals and had
    been detected previously only by optical telescopes and by their radio
    emissions. â€œThe startling thing about these extra-galactic sources is
    that their x-ray output is 10 to 100 times greater than their combined
    output of light and radio waves,â€ Dr. Friedman said, and he suggested
    that an x-ray satellite or a â€œfence-like array of 1,OOO Geiger counters
    erected on the moonâ€ could identify the sources. The discovery sup-

    of years, and in the future, would be characterized by violent cosmic
    explosions far beyond the relative calm of the Milky Way. Dr. Fried-

March 2: In a special message to Congress, President Johnson urged the
    establishment of a Cabinet-level Dept. of Transportation consolidating
    FAA and several other Federal agencies and functions â€œto serve the
    growing demands of this great Nation, to satisfy the needs of our
    expanding industry and to fulfill the right of our taxpayers to maximum
    efficiency and frugality in Government operations.â€ The President
    repeated the proposal made in his State of the Union message Jan. 12

    planned to conduct first flight tests by 1970, he said, and to introduce
    the aircraft into commercial service by 1974. The President also directed
    his Science Adviser to work with NASA, FAA, Dept. of Commerce, and
    Dept. of Housing and Urban Development to devise an â€œaction pro-
    gramâ€ to attack the problem of aircraft noise--cca growing source of

    many of our large jetports.â€ (Pres. Doc., 3/7/66, 304-12)
 I n statement presented to the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and
    Space Sciences, Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator
    for Space Science and Applications, summarized significant 1965
    mission results: â€œThe 1965 successful Space Science and Applications
    missions totalled 16. Of these, eight were scientific satellites; three,
    applications satellites ; three, deep-space probes ; and two were vehicle
    developments. Science and applications experiments have also been
    carried on five manned missions.
       â€œThe list of U S . space firsts was extended during 1965. Ranger IX
    took the first close-up pictures of the floor of a lunar crater. For the
    first time, as television pictures of the lunar surface were being obtained
    from the Moon, they were sent on a real-time basis to home receivers.
    Mariner IV achieved the first successful mission to Mars. It obtained
    the first close-up pictures of the Martian surface, revealing the cratered
    character of the planet. By October 1, 1965, Mariner IV had extended
    the long-range communication record to 191 million miles; it has since
    been tracked to its maximum distance of 216 million miles. The various
    measurements of the Mars magnetic field, atmosphere, and ionosphere
    constitute significant firsts. Early Bird became the first operational
    commercial communication satellite. The first full global picture of the
    Earthâ€™s cloud cover in a single day as it will be observed by TOS was pro-
    vided by TIBOS IX early in the year. In the Gemini program excellent
    pictures were obtained of the terrain and the gegenschein, a faint
    reflection of sunlight from materials dispersed throughout interplanetary
    space. It was clearly established that astronauts can perform scientific
    experiments in space, producing excellent usable results.
       â€œDuring 1965, 138 sounding rockets were launched to continue the
    investigation of our atmosphere, and to carry out exploratory space
    experiments. In support of the International Quiet Sun Year, the ship

    launches and about 80 per cent of the payloads were successful, yielding
    data on cosmic rays, and the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, ionosphere, and mag-
    netic field. A Goddard Space Flight Center sounding rocket observed
    the planet Mars in the ultraviolet, indicating an atmosphere pressure
    of about five millibars at the planetâ€™s surface, which agrees well with
    the Mariner IV data. Other rocket flights made ultraviolet studies of
    the [Ikeya-Seki] Comet of 1965, and of the Sun in ultraviolet and X-ray
    wavelengths.â€ (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 341-5)
March 2: NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acqui-

    consists of ground stations which are operational or under construction
    at 28 locations. These stations are located in the United States and 16
    foreign countries and territories. They represent a total capital invest-
    ment of over $600 million and are operated by more than 2,500 highly

       â€œMany of the stations being used for Gemini support will also be
    used for Apollo. Capabilities are being added at these stations while
    other stations are being established. The network for support of Apollo
              .. .
    missions      will consist of 10 fixed land stations with 30-foot antennas,
    three stations with 85-foot antennas, 1 transportable station, 5 instru-

    cated that this new AMTRAN computer system may reduce the time
    required for solutions of certain problems by a factor of 100. An
    additional economical advantage of AMTBAN is that sets of keyboards
    and display screens, all working through the same central computer,

    had been a mistake, reported Walter Sullivan in the New York Times.
    He noted that the Nov. 28, 1965, issue of Zzvestia had reported the two
    probes would pass on different sides of Venus and that Mstislav Keldysh,

    of the Los Angeles Times reported that U.S. scientists, emphasizing the
    difficulty of knowing the exact track of distant planets, said that a small
    trajectory error could have caused a crash-landing even though a flyby
    might have been programed. (Sullivan, NYT, 3/2/66, 22; Wash. Post,

  Failures of VENUS 11 and 111 space probes were admitted by U.S.S.R. Tassâ€™s
    original announcement had reported that a â€œsoftlandingâ€ had been
    planned for VENUS 111, but a corrected announcement which appeared
    two hours later eliminated the word â€œsoftâ€ and failed to confirm that
    the spacecraft had ejected its sterilized capsule. Tass said the descend-
    ing apparatus had consisted of parachute system and 23.6-in. sphere
     containing instruments to measure Venusian surface temperature and
    pressure, to which â€œheat-resistant substance had been applied ensuring
    protection from high temperatures when braking in the dense layer of
     the atmosphere.â€ VENUS 11 had failed to transmit photos or televise the
    planetâ€™s sunlit side as programed because of a breakdown in its com-
    munications system: â€œThe last radio communications with stations
    Venus 2 and Venus 3 as they approached the planet were not held for
     reasons that had not been established.â€
        Both VENUS 1 and VENUS 111 carried equipment to measure inter-
                       1
    planetary magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and streams of low-energy
     charged particles, in addition to special â€œtrapsâ€ to determine magnitude
     of solar plasma and micrometeorites; however, slightly different instru-
    mentation was used to obtain cross-reading of the data. Both spacecraft
     were similarly constructed with one section for flight equipment and a
     second for auxiliary equipment. Second section in VENUS 11 carried
     television photographic device for use during flyby. Tass said VENUS 11

March 5: Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamaraâ€™s statement to House
    Armed Services Committee that the â€œManned Orbiting Laboratory
    development program should proceed on a deliberate and orderly
    scheduleâ€ received comment by James J. Haggerty, Jr., in Journal ofthe
    Armed Forces: â€œ â€˜Deliberateâ€™ is an excellent word in this context; ac-
    cording to one definition . . . it means â€˜leisurely in movement or

       â€˜â€˜ â€˜Orderlyâ€™, though, is not such a good word. Last summer DOD ap-
    proved hardware development and set a manned flight target of 1968,
    then in a matter of months, reneged on the schedule by whacking almost
    a quarter of a billion doIlars out of the planned funding program.
    McNamara made no mention of a new schedule, but other sources indi-

During week of March 6: Possibility that residents of communities afflicted
    by jet noise might develop psychotic symptoms because their dreams
    were interrupted at night was suggested by Dr. Julius Buchwald,
    psychiatrist, and Dr. Howard M. Bogard, psychologist, at a hearing held
    by New York State Assemblyâ€™s Mental Hygiene Committee. Dr.
    Buchwald said that everybody dreams at least five times a night. If a
    person is awakened and prevented from having his dreams, psychotic
    symptoms from mild to ccmore    severeâ€ could occur, including paranoidal
    delusions, psychoses, hallucinations, and suicidal and homicidal im-
    pulses. Dr. Bogard said persons prevented from dreaming would â€œtend
    toward true psychoses.â€ He urged study of whether residents near air-
    ports â€˜â€˜lose out on dream time,â€ whether such communities become
     â€œdisorientedâ€ by people leaving, and whether family life is disrupted
    because of interruptions of ordinary communications. (Hudson, NYT,

March 7: All primary mission objectives of first unmanned Apollo Saturn IB
    mission Feb. 26 were achieved and flight was very satisfactory according
    to initial evaluation of test results, NASA announced. Guidance and
    control systems performed well; both S-IB and S-IVB trajectories
    and velocities were normal and no structural problems were found in
    either stage or instrument unit. Quality of data received at ground
    stations was excellent and few losses occurred in expected 1,300 meas-
     urements telemetered.
       All spacecraft systems and subsystems performed as planned with
     two exceptions: (1) one of the main parachute harness legs failed to
     sever after landing, thus retaining chute attached to module; and (2)
     Service Module (Sm) propulsion system exhibited below nominal per-
    formance during both firing periods resulting in reentry speed about
     500 mph less than 18,500 mph expected, but sufficient to evaluate
    performance of heatshield for orbital missions. Earth landing system
    functioned properly to safely recover Cm, and unsevered parachute was
     recovered for post-mission examination. Spacecraft would be flown to
     Downey, Calif., for detailed inspection by NASA and NAA Apollo officials
     and tests for improvements. (NASA Proj. Off.; MSFC Release 66-51)

March 11: Dr. Mac C. Adams, NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced
      Research and Technology, outlined the highlights of NASAâ€™s            1965
      advanced research and technology program before the House Committee
      on Science and Astronautics, citing significant contributions to such
      national programs as the supersonic transport (Sst) and the USAF C-5A
      transport, and listing major accomplishments: landing studies of reentry
      lifting bodies, second Fire experiment to measure heat transfer at high
      reentry velocities, two successful firings of 260-in. solid-propellant
      rocket motor, series of successful nuclear rocket firings, 2,600-hr.
      endurance test of an ion engine, and endurance tests of the Snap-8
       nuclear engine which â€œdemonstrated altitude specific impulse of over
      750 1b.-sec./lb.-almost   twice chemical rocket values-and a thrust of
       over 50,000 pounds. Accumulated running time for the reactor tests was
      over 4200 seconds. . . .â€ (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 169-78)
 0 Quasars are relatively small objects 10 million to 1billion yrs. old and 30
      million to 300 million light years from earth that have been shot at super
      speeds out of another galaxy by a titanic explosion, astronomer Dr.

    Halton C. Arp, Mt. Palomar Observatory, contended in Science. Alpâ€™s
    theory contradicted prevailing view that quasars could enable man to see
    the ends of time and space and possibly glimpse the secrets of creation
    because they were on the rim of the u n i v e r s e 1 0 or more billion light
    yrs. away-and were almost as old as the universe-8 billion yrs. Astron-
    omers believed that the quasarsâ€™ â€œred shiftsâ€ in light-changes toward
    red end of the light spectrum as objects speed away-were caused by
    extremely rapid motion away from our own galaxy. Arp suggested that
    quasars might be very dense and compact, exerting a strong gravitational
    attraction for their size which could shift wavelengths to produce â€˜â€˜red
    shifts.â€ (Science, 3/11/66; Weil, ZVush. Post, 3/12/66,2; Sullivan, W T ,

March 11: NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George
    E. Mueller, testifying on FY 1967 budget authorization before the
    House Committee on Science and Astronautics, stated that NASA had
    reached a manpower peak of 300,000 people in the manned spaceflight
    program: â€œWe have passed our peak in engineering, we are reaching our
    peak in manufacturing, and we are at our peak in total Manned Space
                                      .
    Flight manpower resources. . .
       â€œA striking anomaly of the space program is that we begin to â€˜go out
                                                              ...
    of businessâ€™ before we fly our first operational vehicle.      The program
    to develop the uprated Saturn I launch vehicle illustrates this situation.
    The decline in manpower on this program has been underway for several
    months, but the first flight took place only 2 weeks ago-and the first
    manned flight is almost a year away. By then, the employment level will
    be almost half the peak Ievel of 1965.â€
       Reviewing NASA plans for a manned project after Apollo, Dr. Mueller
    cited five major program alternatives under study. The alternatives
    â€œplaced emphasis on (1)direct economic benefits to mankind, (2) lunar
    exploration and science, (3) planetary exploration, (4) maximum effort
    in all program areas, and (5) a program balanced over the whole spec-
    trum of alternatives, which could be shifted as required to meet national
    needs.

    embark.â€ (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 32-3, 148)
0 Performance of Apollo Command Module (Cm), launched Feb. 26 from

     ETB on AS-201 flight, was successful enough to obviate any delay in
    schedule for a 1969 manned lunar expedition, Dr. Joseph Shea, manager
    of MSC Apollo Spacecraft Office, told Gladwin Hill of the New York Times.
    The Cm, on display at North American Aviation, Inc., in Downey, Calif.,
    remained structurally intact, and the few minor technical problems that
    had developed during flight were not serious enough to cause any
    engineering problems in the assembly-line production vehicles for sub-
    sequent phases of the testing program, Dr. Shea said. â€œThis was the
    first major confirmation of design processes and it went quite well.â€

March 12: Gemini 8 hatch difficulty which threatened to delay March 15
    mission was solved by Astronaut David R. Scott. After KSC technicians
    had discovered that 65- to 70-lbs. pull pressure was required to close
    cabin door because of too-thick sealant around hatch edges, Scott worked
    with hatch-closing mechanism until he was satisfied he would have no
    difficulty closing the door in space. Officials preferred to have required
    pull pressure at 40 to 45 lbs., but mission rules would tolerate 80 lbs. If
    hatch could not be closed properly, astronauts would be unable to repres-
    surize their cabin.
       Mission review board of NASA, USAF, and industry officials reaffirmed
    March 15 launch date after studying all factors of the flight: Titan I1 and

     US telescopes most suited for frontier research. Our relative strength
     will be altered with the implementation of plans for construction of
      several large telescopes in the Soviet Union. Any nation can, by placing

    the Magellanic Clouds are the nearest of all external galaxies. The
    United States has taken the initiative in the expensive but highly prom-
    ising field of space-based optical and x-ray astronomy.
        â€œIn radioastronomy the United States now has an impressive group
    of major radio telescopes, but the US position is not preeminent. Even
    the new instruments nearing completion at the California Institute of
    Technology and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory are inferior
    to existing instruments in Australia and the Soviet Union and to large
    new crosstype arrays nearing completion near Sydney and Moscow. The
    US position in space physics and cosmic radiation is good, with some
    question whether present conditions permit further strengthening of
    that position. Research on gravitation is at present not a large sector

      of science and technology. A project serves a larger purpose than its own
      defined immediate ends. A project is a disciplined and organized effort
      directed to a specific objective; one of its principal characteristics is

        Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.) told a luncheon audience that â€œwe
     must lay out basic objectives far enough ahead that they will serve as
     relatively fixed goals-or in non-technical terms, as dreams. Such an
     early dream of man was to fly like a bird; later, we gradually translated
     this dream into making it easy for everyone to fly in an aircraft. We
     have these dreams and they affect our progress strongly. . . . â€
        To meet these ends, Karth recommended forming a â€œHoover-typeâ€
     Commission to review planning and decision-makingsystem in the area
     of science and technology. In addition he cited the need for â€œfrequent,

     is coming in the future.
        â€œSome with fertile imaginations foresee the time when there will be
     large scale emigration from earth to growing settlements on the moon
     and the planets. While I see the great growth in the ability to travel to
     such distant spots safely and speedily, I see little likelihood of any
     sizable movement of population even though nuclear reactors would
     furnish much of the competence to make conditions in such places both
     livable and productive. My reason for not predicting such movement
     is due to the simple belief that living conditions are going to be so
     improved here on earth that few would want to leave. . . .

March 16: Gemini VI11 rendezvous and docking mission-worldâ€˜s first space
    docking-began at ETR with launch of 7,000-1b. Agena Target Vehicle
     (Gatv) by Atlas booster at 1O:OO a m . EST, followed 100 min. later by
    launch of GEMINI â€˜6111 by two-stage Titan I1 booster with Astronauts Neil
100                ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

      A. Armstrong, command pilot, and David R. Scott, pilot. Primary ob-
      jectives of the mission-sixth manned flight in the Gemini series-were
      rendezvous and docking of GEMINI VIII spacecraft with GATV and per-
      formance of extravehicular activity (Eva) for one orbit.
         GATV was injected into near-circular orbit with 186-mi. (299.5-km.)
      apogee and 184-mi. (296.3-km.) perigee; GEMIM VIII entered initial orbit
      with 128.8-mi. (206.4-km.) apogee and 74.9-mi. (119.5-km.) perigee.
      Near third apogee, Armstrong fired aft thrusters, circularizing space-
      craftâ€™s orbit at 168-mi. (270-km.) altitude. Trailing GATV by 139 mi.,
      Armstrong received intermittent lock-on between GEMINI VIII radar and
      GATVâ€™s companion transponder. After sighting GATV at 66-mi. range
      at 04:12 GET, Armstrong fired thrusters and Scott read out computer
      data until 05:15 GET,   when they switched from catch-up to rendezvous
      mode. At 150 ft. from GATV,        Armstrong reported he had matched
      velocity for brief station-keeping exercise. Conditions at that point were
      so favorable that Armstrong passed under GATV and came up 80 ft. in
      front of it, where he was able to read some data on GATVâ€™s status
      display.
         Successful docking was confirmed at 6:33 GET. Plan had been to re-
      main docked with GATV through 7%-hr. sleep period until beginning
      Eva, but at approximately 7:OO GET Spacecraft-GATV combination began
      to roll and yaw violently. Unable to stabilize joined spacecraft, Arm-
      strong fired GEMINI VIIIâ€™S thrusters to undock and maneuvered away
      from the GATV. Once freed, however, GEMINI VIII began to roll even more
      rapidly; roll, pitch, and yaw rates increased, approaching one revolution
      per min. For three minutes, the astronauts fought to control GEMINI VIII;
      finally, with OAMS turned off, Armstrong fired his Reentry Control
      System (RCS)rockets in final attempt to counteract violent roll. This
      maneuver was successful and eight minutes later, at 7:25:30 GET,the
      spacecraft was stabilized. Within a matter of minutes, the problem was
      isolated to the spacecraftâ€™s No. 8 thruster, which had fired inter-
      mittently while GEMINI VIII was docked with GATV and stuck open until
      Armstrong managed to turn off OAMS. It was later determined that a
      short circuit was probable cause of thrusterâ€™s malfunction. Premature
      use of reentry rockets forced Gemini flight director John D. Hodge to
      order an emergency landing, with recovery planned in the western
      Pacific during seventh revolution. (Safety rules of the Gemini program
      required immediate landing of any spacecraft once its Rcs squibs were
      blown; if the flight were allowed to continue, danger of Rcs fuel deple-
      tion would jeopardize firing of RCS rockets, vital to safe return of
      spacecraft and crew.)
         Spacecraft landed 500 mi. west of Okinawa in regular emergency
      recovery area at approximately 10:23 p.m. EST-~O hrs. 42 min. after
      launch. Landing was onIy three miles from intended impact point.
      Within minutes USAF frogmen parachuted from USAF C-54 rescue air-
      craft and placed flotation collar around capsule. At 1:30 a.m. EST cap-
      sule and astronauts were hoisted aboard recovery ship U.S.S. Leonard
      F. Mason.
         Despite early termination, GEMINI VIII mission accomplished one of
      two primary objectives-rendezvous and docking. Original flight plan
      had specified four GEMINI VIII-GATV dockings and two hrs. 15 min. of
      extravehicular activity by Astronaut Scott. Five scientific, four tech-
      nological, and one medical experiment were to have been conducted.
      Flight had been scheduled to last 44 revolutions-approximately 73 hrs.

    in space-a major step on the course we have set. The information they
    have acquired will help us to perfect the spacecrafts that will carry us
    even further.
       â€œFrom their skill and strength we all take heart, knowing that the

March 16: COSMOS CX, launched Feb. 22 with dogs Veterok and Ugolyek
    aboard, landed safely in U.S.S.R. Tass reported that though â€œthe state of
    the animals after landing is good,â€ both dogs had suffered heart beat
    irregularities that had become more pronounced toward the end of the
    22-day flight. Respiration rate had changed insignificantly. During
    initial period of weightlessness, some disruption of coordination had
    been revealed in       rocking of the head.â€ One of the dogs had been
    â€œsubjected to all the complex of irritants to indicate the reaction and
    functional abilityâ€ of the cardiovascular system; the other was used for
    control and comparison. Electronic sensors had provided continuous
    checks on blood pressure, pulse and respiration rates, and other data.
    Dogs had been fed a paste injected into their stomachs by a pneumatic
    device. Spacecraft had carried 300 thermoluminescent dosimeters to
    measure radiation doses in relation to shielding and ten sets of nuclear
    emulsions to determine the composition of radiation. Scientific in-
    formation obtained from the flight, which took the animals through the
    Van Allen radiation belts once during each of COSMOS CXâ€™S 330 revolu-

  President Johnson received 1966 Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy
    Award of the National Space Club at White House for â€œhis efforts in
    shaping the space program from its infancy while a US. senator and as
    chairman of the National Space Council while Vice President and for
    providing the leadership for this nationâ€™s preeminence in space as
    President,â€ and affirmed: â€œWe intend to land the first man on the sur-
    face of the moon and we intend to do this in the decade of the sixties.â€
        He also said: â€œI think if I were writing my own epitaph this morning
    I perhaps would prefer to be remembered, for the period I was Vice
    President, more by this one thing than any other. President Kennedy
    asked me to attempt to organize and give direction to the Space Agency.
     I interviewed about 19 men through the United States and finally
     selected Jim Webb. I prevailed upon him to come and begin this
    undertaking.
        â€œWithin 15 minutes from the time I called the President originally,
    Jim Webb was out here being announced as the new Space Adminis-
     trator. I have been very proud of that announcement ever since.
        â€œYour modesty, humbleness, your great executive ability, your great
    courage, your Marine spirit and determination have made us the envy
     of the world, Mr. Webb, and we salute you publicly.
        reDr. Goddard was a great prophet, a true prophet. To some it seems
    almost incredible that a year before Lindbergh had ever flown the
    Atlantic he was dreaming and working to take us up into the stars. Like
    so many prophets, he was long without honor in his own country, but
    he never lost faith because his faith was founded on fact. He could turn

    his detractors.
       â€œI just wish today that he could be here with us to observe what we
    have just seen. I donâ€™t think he would be the least surprised by the
    progress we have made. I think he would be very proud.â€ (Pres. Doc.,

March 16: The late Dr. Robert Hutchings Goddard launched the first liquid-
    fueledrocket from Auburn, Mass., 40yrs. ago. Annuallyon the anniversary
    of the first flight, Goddard is honored by the National Space Club at a
    memorial banquet in Washington, D.C. In 1962, Vice President Johnson
    predicted that within 25 yrs. there would be a permanent base on the
    moon. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, delivering the 1966 address,
    emphasized that the space budget must be tightly planned: â€œI feel the
    necessity for cost consciousness. This is the need, to put it another
    way, of getting the most space for the tax dollar. These are times when
    we must exert high discipline in public expenditure and our space
    program cannot be exempt from that discipline.â€ Humphrey said he
    could foresee â€œdramatic achievements aheadâ€ in space exploration,
    notably: (1) exploration of the lurain and possible establishment of
    one or more permanent bases there; (2) development of â€˜â€˜a whole family
    of earth-orbiting stations, supplied by regular ferry servicesâ€; (3)
    development of â€œrecoverable and reusable launch vehiclesâ€ and maneu-
    verable spacecraft; (4) building of spaceports around the country; (5)
    improvement of propulsion methods so that planetary trips could be
    made in a week or less; (6) â€œlaunching of unmanned probes to every
    part of the solar system-and perhaps manned planetary expeditions as

March 17: Problems that beset eight of the U.S.â€™s 12 manned space flights
    were listed by AP: July 21, 1961, before any American had achieved
    orbit, Astronaut Virgil I. Grissom had had to swim for his life when the
    hatch blew off the LIBERTY BELL 7 after it had landed at sea; Feb. 20,
    1562, Astronaut John H. Glenn had had to take partial manual control
    of FRIENDSHIP 7 when a small jet thruster failed; May 24,1962, Astronaut
    M. Scott Carpenter was forced to use the horizon when a short circuit
    cut off the device which told him attitude of AURORA 7; May 15-16,
    1963, drinking water leaked into the cabin of FAITH 7, and ground
    stations, fearing the automatic reentry system might have been short
    circuited, directed Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper to fly the spacecraft
    manually in reentry-the first astronaut to do so; June 4-7, 1965,
    Astronauts James A. McDivitt and Edward H. White 11, because of
    malfunctioning computers, controlled GEMINI IV reentry on instructions
    from the ground; Aug. 21-29, 1965, Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and

0 Press commented on the GEMINI VIII mission.

       New York Times: â€œThe docking maneuver thus successfully pioneered
    is of the utmost importance. It is through combining the loads brought
    into space by individual rockets that the great structures can be built
     that will be necessary for manâ€™s activities in the cosmos in the years
     ahead. Tomorrowâ€™s stations in space will serve as laboratories for
     astronomers and other scientists, as terminals for transshipment of
    passengers and freight between short-range and long-range rockets,
     and unfortunately-if the future resembles the past-also as military
     bases reflecting in the sky the tensions and hostilities of earth. But
     whatever purpose they serve, these islands in space will have been
     made possible by repeated use of the same maneuver that Astronauts
     Armstrong and Scott performed for the first time last night.â€
        Washington Post: Ypace feats have become so commonplace and
     have been carried out with such precision that we tend to forget about
     the hazards. The abrupt but fortunately safe return of Gemini 8 is a
     timely reminder that space is still a frontier and that the exploration
     remains at best an inexact science.
        â€œThat Astronauts Armstrong and Scott enierged unharmed from their
     awesome experience with their space capsule out of control is a tribute
     not only to their own cool judgment but also to the extraordinary
     competence of Space Agency officials. Americans listening to reports
     of the emergency must have applauded collectively when the crewmen
     made a successful reentry. They survived a predicament in space which,
     had it been on a highway, would have meant disaster.â€

      the mission was a success in the sense of demonstrating the care with
      which emergency devices were built into the space ship and the thor-
      oughness of the planning for rescue operations in event of a forced
      landing. It is possible, indeed, that more can be learned from a mission
      that goes wrong than from one which is successful all the way.
         â€œIncidentally, there is a commentary on our times in the fact that
      while the suspense-filled space story was unfolding, Batman was being
      shown on television. The ABC network interrupted the program with
      special news announcements, and was rewarded with more than 1,000
      phone calls from complaining viewers.â€ (NYT, 3/17/66, 36M; Wash.

 March 17: Discussing the urgency of NASAâ€™s      deciding â€œwhat to do in space
      after the first Apollo astronauts return from the moon about 1970,â€
                                                                .

      forget a hint, dropped
      years ago. The Soviet Union, this functionary suggested, might very
      well celebrate the 50th anniversary of its great revolution by having
      cosmonauts plant a flag on the lunar surface. That deadline-if it is a
     deadline-is now less than 20 months away.
        â€œBut suppose the Soviet Union is not racing us to the moon, or for
     that matter suppose that she is. In the present state of planning, the
     US.with the moon in its grasp would be very much like a dog chasing
     an automobile-what does he do with it if he catches it?â€ (Hines,

  USA-USAF-USN X-22A V/Stol airplane, designed and built by Bell Aero-
    systems Co. under Navy contract, completed 10-min. first flight at
     Niagara Falls (N. Y.) International Airport. The four-engine, dual-
    tandem, ducted-propeller craft made four takeoffs and landings, reaching
    25-ft. maximum allowable altitude. While hovering, Bell test pilots
    Stanley J. Kakol and Paul Miller, Jr., executed a 180â€ counterclockwise
    turn and reported that X-22A responded to â€œall control commands.â€
    After planned 225-hr. flight test series, Bell would deliver their two
    X-22A research aircraft to a tri-service group at Patuxent Naval Air
    Test Center, Md., for further evaluation. (Bell Releases 3/17/66,

March 1 : First anniversary of the VOSKHOD 11 mission when Soviet Cos-
         8
    monaut Aleksey A. Leonov became the first man to float in space.
    Interviewed on Radio MOSCOW,       Leonov said his space walk had caused
     the spacecraft to begin rotating unexpectedly: â€œDown on earth we had
     trained for every emergency, but not for this since we had thought
    my weight of 176 pounds would have no effect on a six-ton ship. Yet,
    my weight caused the ship to rotate.â€
        Pravda disclosed that VOSKHOD 11, carrying Leonov and Col. Pave1 I.
    Belyayev, had landed outside the target area in a snowbank near the
     city of Perm in the Ural Mountains: â€œSearchers took more than 24
    hours to reach the cosmonauts and another 24 hours and a 12-mile
    ski trip before the men could be lifted out of.the forest by helicopters.â€

  Speaking in Denver at Colorado Womenâ€™s College, Dr. Nancy G . Roman,
    NASA Chief of Astronomy Programs, OSSA, said a primary reason for
    lack of women in space was that few had the scientific training. Even
    NASAâ€™s women professionals were few compared to their number
            300
    in other agencies, she said. Young women interested in a career in
    space science were advised to concentrate first on the basics of their
    preferred area â€œbecause the fundamentals of the science used in space
    study are no different from those in more traditional fields. Equally
    important is to learn how to think, to face and solve problems and how
                                                             ....

    career depends on the individual whoâ€™s considering it. It is glamorous-
    and itâ€™s also dirty work.â€ Dr. Roman said she was sure there would be
    women astronauts â€œif manned space flights continue as we expect
    them to.â€ (von Ende, Denver Post, 3/19/66)

    as the probable cause of the difficulty which cut short the flight of
    GEMINI VIII.â€ MSC Director Dr. Robert R. Gilruth said data ruled out any
    possibility of pilot error and that â€œin fact, the crew demonstrated re-
    markable piloting skill in overcoming this serious problem and bringing
    the spacecraft to a safe landing.â€ NASA Associate Director for Manned
    Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller, who had participated in review of
    data, joined Dr. Gilruth in saluting Astronauts Armstrong and Scott and
    commended the evaluation team for â€œcoming up with the answerâ€ in
    less than 72 hrs. following the incident. â€œThis will give us time to study
    the Gemini 9 configuration and make any adjustments necessary in
    order to press forward with our Gemini flight test program.â€

    begin an intensive three-day conference with Gemini project officials to
    attempt to reconstruct events leading to their loss of control of the
    GEMINI VIII spacecraft March 16. Scott told a crowd at the airstrip that
    â€œthe lift off, launching, rendezvous, and docking were really tremendous.
    We were really looking forward to the whole mission.â€ Armstrong
    agreed, adding: â€˜?We had a magnificent flight in the first seven hours.

    ever been.â€ (AP, NYT, 3/20/66, 82)
* Rep. John W. Wydler (R-N.Y.) said in a speech before the American
    Society of Tool & Manufacturing Engineers in Westbury, N.Y.: â€œTwo
    years ago I asked Administrator Webb for NASAâ€™s        future space plans
    and was told that none existed. I pointed out then that such plans were
    essential. Last year, we received assurance that the presentations of the
    fiscal year 1967 budget would reveal such plans. But none has been
    issued. Instead, NASA Administrator Webb has told us â€˜the future of the
    NASA program lies largely in the decision for fiscal year 1968.â€™ . . .

          Our space program began in an atmosphere of perplexity and fear.
    Our adversaries in Russia had chosen a new arena for the struggle of
    international power and prestige. They threatened to achieve impressive
    capabilities which we would be unable to match. But, characteristically,
    the United States rose to the occasion in one of the biggest sustained
    technological efforts ever seen. Today, the U.S.S.R. is denied many of
    the options for surprising space spectaculars which they once had.
    From month to month, one country or the other may seem to be leading
    the so-called space race, but our proven capability shows that we are
    not to be placed at any military or strategic disadvantage.

    Visible to the naked eye in early morning or just before sunset, sunspot
    had 88,000-mi. dia. and was expected to affect weather conditions and
    radio communications on earth during the next few days. Sunspot was
    unexpected since 1966 had been designated â€œyear of the quiet sunâ€ and
    scientists had expected only a minimum of solar disturbances. (WI,

e Commentary in the Washington Sunday Star: â€œOne of the saddest lessons
     of Gemini 8 is that bureaucrats will be bureaucrats. . . . NASA officials
     suppressed for about 18 hours tape recordings of ground-to-orbit con-
     versations under circumstances that strongly suggest their only reason
     for the suppression was to make sure nothing embarrassing was on the
     tapes.
        â€œFor as long as the United States has been active in space, it has cul-
     tivated an image of openness in contrast to the Russiansâ€™ obsession with
     secrecy. The overnight gag on tape recordings-which turned out to be
     legitimate items of news interest-only served to tarnish this image of
     candor.â€ (Wash. Sun. Star, 3/â€™20/66, G1)
  Endorsement of suggestion in Jan. 9 open letter to President Johnson that
     he invite â€œa Russian cosmonaut to join an American astronaut for a

     editor Jess Gorkin. Newspapers throughout the world had publicized
     the idea and written favorable editorials. Le Figaro (Paris) had given it
     front page coverage. Melbourne (Australia) Herald had said the idea
     had â€œgreat merit.â€

       USAF Chief of Staff Gen. John P. McConnell told the meeting that
    U.S. and U.S.S.R. had enough long-range nuclear weapons to make a
    nuclear war between them extremely costly for either side, but that
    a stalemate did not exist between them: â€œIt follows that each country
    has its own nuclear threshold, that is, the point or level of restraint
    above which it may no longer be deterred from war. This threshold is
    by no means static but dynamic, as it is determined by a number of
    factors which are both variable and unpredictable.â€ McConnell said
    the strategic superiority of USAF during the past 20 yrs. had kept
    the nuclear threshold of all potential aggressors at a safe level. (Text)
       USAFâ€™S first priority-continued   maintenance of strategic superiority
    over any potential enemy-required a mixed force of missiles and
    manned bombers, Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Harold Brown told
    the convention. â€œWe will continue to need manned bombers in our
    strategic forces as far ahead as any of us can see, and I think that should

    Also, the camera pictures are clear and sharp and no stray light appears
    above the horizon. Apparently the optics remained clean upon exposure

    ice and winter conditions. When a spring thaw occurs, the gas may be
    released in some quantity, producing flames which could be yellow,
    red, or blue-green.â€ In the Hillsdale case, he added, the sighting might
    have been assisted by youths â€œplaying pranks with flares.â€ Hynekâ€™s

       LRC scientist J. Reece Roth described an electric rocket life-support
    system that would supply interplanetary crews with meals which, when
    metabolized, would serve as fuel for spacecraftâ€™s engine. According to
    Rothâ€™s concept, some or all of the propellant, in the form of food, water,
    and oxygen, would be metabolized by crew to carbon dioxide, water, and
    solid wastes. CO, and water could then be used as propellant for an
    electric engine while solid residues would be small enough to be stored
    or discarded. Propellant reserve could be used for food, navigational
    corrections, and radiation shielding-enhancing safety of the crew.
    Weight savings from integrated propulsion and life-support system
    would be so great, Roth said, that a somewhat less efficient thruster
     could be used with no overall loss in performance. (LRC Release 66-12)

    Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newel1 said: cf. . .as a
    science, space astronomy simply cannot thrive in separation from
    ground-based astronomy. In fact, the phrase â€˜space astronomyâ€™ is a dis-
    quieting one. The discipline is astronomy, the objective of which,
    broadly speaking, is to advance our understanding of the universe in
    which we live. The word â€˜spaceâ€™ in space astronomy refers simply to the
    fact that sounding rockets, satellites, and space probes are new tools
    that the astronomer can use in wrestling with the difficult problems of
    astronomical observation. In perspective, the astronomical community
    has before it the task of using these new tools in effective combination
    with ground-based observing so as to best advance the science of
    astronomy.â€
        Dr. Nancy G. Roman, NASA Chief of Astronomy Programs, OSSA, said:
     â€˜â€˜So far, all space astronomy has been automated. However, as the
    manned space program matures, plans are being made to incorporate the
    flexibility of manned operation to the program to an increasing ex-
    tent.. . . We recognize that even simple operations by man could
    greatly extend both the lifetime and the versatility of an OAO, and there-
    fore have been looking into the possibilities of using man in such
    maintenance activities. Looking further ahead, we aIso realize that
    eventually astronomers will want larger telescopes in space than are

  B/G J. C. Maxwell (USAF), FAA deputy administrator for supersonic devel-

    the first American Sst for airline service may exceed four billion dollars.
    He explained: â€œThe SST program has been, and still remains, a high risk
    program. That fact, combined with the sheer magnitude of the develop-
    ment cost, is why the Government is participating in the program to
    develop an aircraft aimed solely at a civil market.â€ Adding that the cost
    estimate was ccconsiderablymore than the total net worth of the major
    aircraft manufacturers combined,â€ Maxwell said: â€œOur philosophy for
    financing the SST program beyond the prototype construction and flight
    test phase is to encourage industry and the financial community to
                                                                          123
                  ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

    assume as much responsibility and risk as practicable. We eagerly look
    foward to the day when we can turn the whole program over to private
    enterprise. Conceivably, this could occur when the prototype has flown
    and proven out the design. If all goes well-and the work performed by
    the airframe and engine manufacturers during the past nine months
    gives us cause for optimism-the SST prototype will take to the air in
    Iate 1969 or early in 1970 to begin an intensive period of testing. At
    about this time, production development will get underway with the
    first production model rolling off the line early in 1973 followed by type
    certification and entry into commercial service by 1974.â€ Although the
    British-French Concorde was expected to be in airline service by 1971,
    Maxwell said this three-year timelag would be offset by the U.S. Sstâ€™s
    advantages: (1)cruising speed of mach 2.7, compared with Concordeâ€™s
    2.2; (2) 250-passenger capacity, compared with Concordeâ€™s anticipated

    it was possible to derive information on the changing magnetic field by

During week of April 1: Pulsed laser beam communications system which
     could penetrate cloud of plasma or charged gases surrounding space-
     craft during reentry and avoid communications blackout was patented
     by General Electric Co. engineers Dr. Kiyo Timiyasu and James R.
     Whitten. Principal use of invention would be in line-of-sight communi-
     cations between earth stations and spacecraft, but two land stations not
     in line of sight also could exchange information by using cloud re-
     flections. (Jones, NYT, 4/2/66, 32)

April 3: Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Jodrell Bank Experimental Station,
     told the press that LUNA x spacecraft had gone into orbit around the
     moon, but that â€œall may not be wellâ€ with it. He suggested that LUNA x
     was tumbling uncontrollably in orbit around moon at distance of 300 or
     400 mi.; this theory evolved after Jodrell Bank detected a series of
     maneuvers beginning at 12:50 p.m. EST-15 min. after Jodrell Bank had
     first picked up LUNA xâ€™s signals. Frequency of the signals had begun to
     decrease, indicating the probe was under the moonâ€™s gravitational pull
     at a distance of about 2,000 mi.; signals then faded out entirely, sug-
     gesting that the retrorockets had been fired and the probe had landed.
     At that point Lovell said: â€œWe think Luna 10 landed at 1:44 P.M. [EST].â€
     Minutes later, however, signals again picked up and the situation became
     cc
        extremely obscure.â€ He concluded: â€œAt last hearing our signals could
     be interpreted as coming from a tumbling spacecraft. We find it difficult
     to believe that it is meant to be tumbling.â€
         U.S.S.R. had announced LUNA xâ€™s lunar-orbit mission after March 31
     launch. Sir Bernardâ€˜s theory came a day before Soviet announcement
     of mission results [see April 41. (NYT, 4/4/66, 9; AP, Balt. Sun,

    at 1:44 p.m. EST April 3 to become worldâ€™s first artificial moon satellite,
     U.S.S.R. announced at 23rd Communist Party Congress meeting in the
     Kremlin. Accomplishment was dramatized by direct broadcast from
     LUNA x of the Communist anthem, â€œInternationale.â€
        Tass released details of LUNA Xâ€™S structure and flight. 3,530-lb. space-
     craft consisted of two main parts: moon satellite section and engine
     facilities section. 540-lb. satellite was an airtight package containing
     radio equipment, telemetry system, equipment for studying the moon
     and near-lunar space, heat-regulation and power supply systems, and
     small jet engines to stabilize the flight.
        Approximately 8,000 km. (4,969 mi.) from the lunar surface, space-
     craft was oriented so that jet of the engine was directed against direction
     of its movement. At approximately l:44 p.m. EST retrorockets fired
     automatically, slowing spacecraft to 1.3 km. (.8 mi.) per second and
     putting it in lunar orbit. Twenty minutes after switching off retrorockets,
     earth command was sent to separate instrumented lunar satellite from
     engine facilities section, and first radio communications session was
     held. Equipment was functioning normally and radio communications
     were stable. There was no suggestion that photos of the lunar surface
     were being transmitted to earth, or that LUNA x was â€œtumblingâ€ [see

      agencies.â€ Mullins added: â€œWe agree that the private enterprise system
      should be preserved. But there is such a thing as a national objective.
      By acknowledging this in the new directive, we feel we are basing our
      policy on a much stronger foundation. Preserving the free enterprise

April 4-6: The importance of imagination in shaping the future was em-
    phasized by AFSC Commander Gen. Bernard A. Schriever in a speech
    before Arnold Air Societyâ€™s 18th National Conclave, Dallas: â€œBack in
     the 1930s we had what we thought were pretty fantastic ideas for the
    future. We thought that it might be possible to fly a plane up to the
     sound barrier. There were even people who thought it might be possible
     to break through it somehow-at least for short periods. A few people
     had heard about Dr. Robert Goddard and his work with rockets. They
    knew that he had already launched a rocket several hundred feet into
     the air. Science writers were speculating that we might be able to get
    something out into space by the beginning of the next century.
        â€œAs it turns out, even the most fantastic thinking 30 years ago has
     proved to be very conservative. We have already flown planes like the
     SR-71 at speeds greater than mach 3 for extended periods. The experi-
     mental X-15 has flown at mach 6 and reached altitudes of over 50 miles.
     Our long-range ballistic missiles have ranges of from 5,000 to 9,000
     miles. And our Mercury and Gemini astronauts have sped through space
     for extended periods at speeds better than 17,000 miles per hour. With
     the Apollo program we are not too many years away from landing a
     man on the moon.â€ (Text)

     Later analysis of data indicated the failure was because of a malfunction
     in Centaurâ€™s attitude control system [see May 31. Purpose of AC-8
     mission was to demonstrate Centaurâ€™s capability to restart its high-energy
     engines in the space environment following coast period in earth
     orbit. Success of this mission was vital to NASAâ€™S first operational mission
     which would attempt to land Surveyor spacecraft on the moon. Centaur
     program was directed by NASA OSSA and managed by LRC. (NASA Releases

April 9: LUNA x had detected electrons with energies higher than cosmic
     radiation, Tass reported: â€œData have been obtained which may be inter-
     preted as evidence of the existence in the near-lunar space of ffuxes of
     electrons with energies of tens of thousands of electron volts. These
     ff uxes are 70 to 100 times more intense than the cosmic ray background.
     Possibly, this phenomenon is due to the earthâ€™s magnetic â€˜tail.â€™ Later
     measurements will permit more positive conclusions on the radiation
      conditions near the moon.â€ In addition, preliminary data analysis
      showed that intensity of the moonâ€™s qagnetic field was â€œsomewhat above
      the level of magnetic fields in free interplanetary spaceâ€ and that
      meteorite â€œparticle densityâ€ near the moon was higher than in â€œinter-

April 12: Cosmonautics Day in U.S.S.R., celebrating fifth anniversary of
     first manned space fight by Yuri Gagarin, was marked by condemnations
     of military orientation of U S . space efforts and predictions of Soviet
     space successes. Cosmonaut Gagarin, speaking in the Kremlin, said:
     ccAmericanscientists and cosmonauts have carried out a number of
     interesting experiments. This is to their credit. It is to be deeply
     regretted, however, that American cosmonautics is increasingly falling
     under the influence of the Pentagon, which regards outer space as the
     theater of future military operations.â€ Gagarin pledged â€œall his energies
     and knowledgeâ€ to help in the lunar mission and said man must make
     himself at home on the moon â€œto establish stations which will serve as
     points of departure for longer space voyages and also as astronomical
     observatories and scientific laboratories.â€
        Cosmonaut Gherman Titov, speaking in a taped interview on Moscow
     television, predicted that â€œbuilders and assemblers will one day exit
     into space and put together various parts of space stations, assemble
     spaceships and stations on the moon, and build various structures.â€
        In a Pravdu article Marshal Konstantin Vershinin, head of Soviet
     Air Force, predicted a new manned space mission that could take
     several cosmonauts through the Van M e n radiation belts. He noted

     Congressional discontent with NASAâ€™s     increasing administrative costs.
     Webb said the US. was behind in the space race â€œexcept for rendezvous
     and docking, and the Ranger mission. . . . Russia has widened the gap
     during the past two years, launching two Proton payloads of 27,500
     pounds each-which is heavier than we can lift-recovering payloads

April 16: Preliminary results of flight of U.S.S.R.â€™s LUNA X, placed in circum-
     lunar orbit April 3 to become moonâ€™s first artificial satellite, were an-
     nounced at Moscow press conference. President of the Soviet Academy
     of Sciences Mstislav Keldysh said that considerably less braking power
     had been required to put a spacecraft in orbit around the moon than
     had been required in a soft landing. This had made it possible to increase
     the payload in LUNA x and to equip it with instruments for important
     studies of the moon and the space surrounding it.
         Academician Aleksandr Vinogradov, geochemist, said that study of
     radioactivity of rocks on the lunar surface had indicated the overall in-
     tensity of gamma radiation on the lurain was comparable to the in-
      tensity of gamma radiation emitted by terrestrial granites [see April 131.
     However, part of it was not due to natural radioactivity but to inter-
      action of cosmic rays and lunar matter. Such radiation was absent in
      terrestrial rocks because of the shielding effect of the earthâ€˜s atmosphere.
     Lunar rocks were comparable in natural radioactivity to basalt rocks on
      earth, indicating that â€œthe processes of the formation of the core of the
     planets of the earth group apparently have the same mechanism.â€
         Prof. Naum Grigorov said readings of LUNA xâ€™s magnetometer indi-
      cated presence near the moon of a weak, homogenous, and regular
      magnetic field. Streams of ions of small energies were registered. Analy-
      sis of materials transmitted by LUNA x showed the intensity of particles
                                                                           141

    in the moonâ€™s radiation belt was 100,000 times less than in the earthâ€™s
    radiation belts.
        Prof. Alexandr Mikhailov, director of the Pulkovo Observatory, said
    existence of an artificial moon satellite was important not only for
    physical research, but also for determining more exactly the mass and
    shape of the moon-information vital for building an exact theory of
    the motion of the moon and for study of the unevenness of the earthâ€˜s
     rotation.
        Replying to questions, Academician Keldysh said LUNA x did not
     carry photocameras but was intended for physical study of near-lunar
     space and the moon itself-its nature, ionosphere, radiations, and fields.
     Satellite would orbit the moon for â€œa few years.â€ Duration could not be
     predicted since parameters of the moonâ€™s gravitational field were not
     known. Keldysh said that since assembly of large spacecraft in orbit was
     an important step toward the conquest of outer space, cosmonauts were
     preparing for the solution of this task. Referring to the problem of
     manned flights to the moon, he stressed that the most difficult task to
     be solved was return of the spacecraft into earthâ€™s atmosphere. Keldysh
     said dogs Veterokâ€™s and Ugolyekâ€™s passages through radiation belts in
     COSMOS cx had had no apparently serious effect on them but that pro-
     longed observations were necessary. (Tass, 4/18/66)

     launched by us under existing agreements and, at this date, other agree-
     ments are in early prospect. We have opened our own satellites to foreign
     experimenters. Some twenty experiments proposed by scientists abroad
     have been selected on their merits for flight on our satellites. These
     foreign experiments are contributed to the program; we contribute space
     in the satellite and its support systems and retrieve the data for the
     experimenter. Even wider cooperation-with twenty different countries
     -is achieved through programs which utilize small, nonorbiting rockets
     to obtain data for which satellites do not commend themselves. In all of
     these projects, we have shared the tasks and costs in literal cooperation
     without exporting a dollar.â€ (Text)
April 17: New evidence supporting theory that Venusâ€™ environment could
     sustain life was published by Johns Hopkins Univ. astrophysicists
     William Plummer and John Strong in Astrophysical Journal. Past
     measurements of microwave emissions from Venus had indicated very
     high surface temperatures. Plummer and Strong concluded, on the
     basis of recent detailed measurements from high-altitude balloon
     observations by Cal Tech radioastronomers, that possibly â€œ30 percent
     of the observed microwaves in the past had no bearing on surface
     temperatures but rather emanated from electrical discharges within
     the cloudy atmosphere of Venus.â€ They estimated Venusâ€™ temperature
     ranges from 580Â°F at equator to 9Â°F at poles and said there are extensive
     regions-greater than earthâ€™s land area--â€œwhere man would find the
     temperature comfortable.â€ (NYT, 4/18/66, 4; Wash. Post, 4/18/66,

  Supersonic transport and rocket flights in the next few decades could
     raise the average surface temperature of the earth by almost half a
     degree by spewing tons of chemical pollutants into the atmosphere,
     said Dr. Gordon J. F. MacDonald, UCLA planetary and space physicist,
    in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. Heavy burning of coal, oil,
    and gas introduced by the industrial revolution in the 19th century
    and the automotive revolution in the 20th had increased carbon dioxide
    in the atmosphere by about 15 per cent, MacDonald estimated. The
     carbon dioxide created a layer of gas that allowed heat from the sun to
    reach the earth but stopped it from escaping when it was re-radiated
    back from the earth. This was the â€œgreenhouse effect,â€ which raised
    the temperature below the layer and Iowered the temperature above the
    layer. â€œFour hundred supersonic aircraft flying four flights a day on
    intercontinental routes, would affect surface temperatures as much as
    the whole industrial and automotive revolutions have to date,â€ Mac.
     Donald said. (Getze, L A . Times, 4/18/66)

0 A new nuclear particle-the       most massive and most stable yet found-
    had been discovered by physicists at Argonne National Laboratory
     (ANL). Three and a half times as heavy as the proton, the particle was
     ft
        a â€˜nucleon resonanceâ€™ known simply as Nâ€3245.â€ The number
     â€œ3245â€ stood for 3,245 million electron volts, the amount of its
     energy. According to Dr. Alan D. Krisch of Univ. of Michigan, nucleon
     resonances â€œmay be â€˜excitedâ€™ or highly energetic states of protons and
                ..
     neutrons . and can be produced only in accelerators. They are not
     observed in nature.â€ Krisch, along with John R. Oâ€™Fallon, Keith
     Ruddick, and Steven W. Kormanyos of Univ. of Michigan, and Lazarus
     G. Ratner of ANL, made the discovery using Argonneâ€™s 13.5-billion elec-
     tron volt (Bev) zero gradient synchrotron. They said this â€œabnormally
     stableâ€ particle has a lifetime of one ten-thousandth of a millionth of a
     millionth of a millionth of a second, which is â€œlonger than that of any
     of its family of nuclear particles.â€ Krisch suggested N*3245 may have
     â€œan unusually high spin which prevents it from decaying easily.â€

     the magnitude and importance of the investment in the space program
     dictate that informed citizens from all walks of life participate in a
     national dialogue on decisions involved: â€œWe in NASA do not feel that
                                                                            ..
     the planning of our space programs is the prerogative of NASA alone. .
     The budget for the coming fiscal year permits NASA to hold open the
     option for a program to procure additional flight vehicles beyond those
     now programmed, so as to employ the Apollo hardware, facilities and
     capabilities at least through 1971. If we do not exercise this option in
     the decision for the 1968 budget, we will have to begin a phase-down of
     the manned space flight activities and the â€˜mothballingâ€™ of some of our
     facilities. At a small fraction of the initial cost we can continue and we
     can expand our operations in space for the next ten years and more.
     These operations will have tremendous implications for our national
     security and for our position of world leadership, in addition to the
     benefits of scientific advancement and the betterment of manâ€™s life on
     Earth. . . . In the area of national security, our expenditures in space
     probably represent the cheapest insurance policy the nation can buy
     for the future.â€ (Text)

      sense to undertake the first Martian landing without some precedent
      exploratory steps. We must first orbit and map the planet and ascertain
      where a landing would be profitable.
         â€œTo do the planetary exploration job effectively, we now need a
      tactical program of specific flights on specific dates with the instru-
  . mentation necessary to plan to accomplish those tasks. I remind you
      that what we are doing today was planned in 1961. And yet, when we

     rock would have alternate polarization, depending on the time the

low-energy cosmic rays presented at APS meeting by Dr. Donald E.
Hagge of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Hagge noted satellite
measurements and recent â€œquiet sun yearâ€ had given physicists â€œan
                                .
unprecedented opportunity . . for meaningful cosmic ray research.â€
High-apogee satellites permitted measurement of low-energy particles
â€˜â€˜not directly observable on the surface of the earthâ€ due to protective
atmosphere and influence of earthâ€™s magnetic field. Minimum of ccsolar
modulationâ€-suppression of galactic particles by sunâ€™s magnetic field
upon attempted penetration of solar system-meant that â€˜particles
observed during 1965 most nearly represent the true situation outside
the solar system.â€ (GSFC Release, 3/27/66)
    J. A. Simpson of Enrico Fermi Institute, Univ. of Chicago, reported
these satellite experiments had revealed â€œnew features in the cosmic
radiation regarding the energy distribution, the chemical and isotopic
composition of the cosmic rays at hitherto unattainable energies.â€
Origin of â€œultra-low-energy nuclei,â€ which reached vicinity of earth
during 1965 period of minimum solar modulation, may be supernovae,
Simpson suggested. (Fermi Institute Release, 4/27/66)
    Simpson and J. J. Oâ€™Gallagher, also of Fermi Institute, presented
results of study of solar flare particle propagation based on simul-
taneous observations by MARINER IV space probe and Imp satellites.
Evidence showed that â€œprotons are confined by interplanetary magnetic
fields to narrow channels extending outward from the sunâ€ and
 â€œparticles in these channels are carried around the sun by magnetic
fields which co-rotate with the sun.â€ (Fermi Institute Release, 4/29/66)
    Paul J. Coleman, Jr., of UCLA,   presented results of â€œa recently com-
pleted statistical analysis of records of the magnetic field and plasma
velocity, obtained in late 1962 with instruments aboard the spacecraft
MARINER 11,â€ including Pcexperimentalevidence that [hydromagnetic]
 waves do exist in interplanetary space.â€ Discussing properties of solar
 wind, Coleman said MARINER 11% measurements had indicated average
 temperature of positive ions in plasma was about 200,000â€K. He.noted
 that its high temperature and low density â€œsuggest that the plasma is
 completely ionized. â€ (APSRelease, 4/26/66)
     Discussing importance of their NASA-sponsored stellar wind study,
 S. H. Lam of Princeton Univ. and G. Sandri of Aeronautical Research
 Associates of Princeton, Inc., said: â€œThe cosmic radiation that reached
 the Earth, or any satellite that has been sent into space by man, has
 been attenuated, or as the specialists say â€˜modulated,â€™ by the solar wind.
 Therefore, we cannot measure directly the constitution of the cosmic
 radiation as it exists in interstellar space unaffected by the solar wind.
 Yet, to be able to understand the origin of the cosmic radiation, we
 must know its true constitution in interstellar space. A proper under-
 standing of the solar wind will greatly facilitate this difficult task.â€
 Lam and Sandri presented electrostatic mode1 for stellar winds at APS
 meeting. (APS Release, 4/29/66)
     Discovery of first celestial body, â€œCygnus GR-1,â€ identifiable as a
  â€œpoint source of high energy gamma radiation,â€ was announced to
 APS by Univ. of Rochester physicists J. G. M. Duthie, Roland W. Cobb,
 and Joseph Stewart. Discovery of source, which coincided with a region
  already identified as an x-ray source known as â€œCygnus XR-1,â€ climaxed
  five years of research sponsored by NASA and NSF. (Univ. of Rochester

         Describing the Alfven Propulsion Engine (Ape) in a paper on hydro-
     magnetic propulsion and drag in space vehicles, M. A. Ruderman, New
     York Univ., said: â€œA source of electrical power (nuclear, or solar
     panels) sufficient to power one hundred common light bulbs could
     raise the altitude of a 5-ton satellite about 100 miles in a week of
     operation. By allowing the motor to act as a generator the orbital
     energy of this same satellite can be converted into electrical energy,
     contributing sufficient drag to lower the satellite altitude by almost
     15 miles per day.â€ (APS Release, 4/26/66)
         Cal Tech physicist H. Victor Neher described latitude survey of
     cosmic rays: â€œOnce we satisfied ourselves that instruments sent by
     balloons up to altitudes of 140,000 feet, near the earthâ€™s magnetic poles,
     gave answers directly comparable to those found by Mariners I1 and
     IV, it became less important to depend on spacecraft for our data. This
     was good news because we have a flexibility and control of balloon
     flights that are not possible with spacecraft.â€ (APS Release, 4/28/66)
April 25-28: Radiotelescopes trained on radio galaxies might discover the
     quark, which had been proposed as the most elementary particle, Purdue
     Univ. physicists C. S. Shen and T. K. Kuo theorized to APS. Suggested
     two years ago by Dr. Murray Gell-Mann of Cal Tech, the quark was
     described by Shen as â€œa very, very elegant, beautiful theory. There
     are so many elementary particles. Physicists are all confused as to how
     they are constructed. If they are all constructed from quarks, it is very
     simple.â€ (Clark, NYT, 4/26/66, 28; Wash. Eve. Star, 4/29/66, A14)
April 26: First test transmissions of long-range radio and television com-

     â€œWe in the Department of Defense have always looked upon space less
     as a matter of adventure and more as a matter of necessity; we explore
     its potential not because it is â€˜thereâ€™ but because we have needs that
     are â€˜here.â€™ It is not that we have identified fundamentally new missions
     since the early days of our space effort. We have, however, begun to
     recognize new applications for space-based systems, particularly in the
     tactical field. The opportunities are tremendous-and sometimes so
     are the problems. We are no longer as enamored with the â€˜howâ€™ of
     developing a satellite system. We now take a hard look at the â€˜whyâ€™ of
     choosing one approach to solving a military need over another-and
     this most assuredly includes competing earth-based systems as well.
      We have come to recognize that our launch vehicle capability coupled
     with better sensors permits us to do more missions from synchronous
      orbit. We also are beginning to sense that there is a high potential for
      combining operational functions in a multiple-purpose satellite where
      common sensor packages and orbital parameters exist.â€ (DOD Release

April 28: NASA issued a fact sheet on US. international space programs which
     listed criteria applied to determine value and acceptability of cooperative
     arrangements in space activity: (1) cooperative project must have
     scientific validity and mutual interest; (2) cooperative project must be
     conducted openly, with the scientific results being made freely available
     to the world scientific community; (3) each participant must accept
     financial responsibility for its own contribution to the project.
         Since their inception, NASAâ€™s international programs had involved 71
     countries or separate jurisdictions and had included satellite projects,
     individual experiments flown on NASA satellites, sounding rocket in-
     vestigations, and a variety of programs in which foreign ground-based
     observations were coordinated with flight projects.
         US. had concluded bilateral agreements providing for launch of 14
     scientific satellites instrumented and, in all but two cases, engineered
     abroad. Six of these satellites had already been successfully launched
      (one each for France and Italy and two each for Canada and U.K.).
      Other satellites would be contributed by the European Space Research
      Organization (ESRO), U.K., Canada, Italy, and Germany.
         U.S. had also opened its own satellites, manned and unmanned, to
     participation by foreign experimenters. Sixteen such experiments had
     been accepted for flight.
         Some 17 countries had entered into agreements with NASA for one or
     more cooperative sounding rocket projects. Such investigations had been
      initiated by both U.S. and foreign proposals. They had accounted for
      roughly 150 launchings in a five-year period with rockets ranging
      widely in size and type, from boosted Darts and Arcas to Nike combina-
      tions, Aerobees, Shotputs, British Skylarks, and French Centaures.

0 A Soviet victory in the race to achieve first manned lunar landing â€œwould

    be a worldwide propaganda disgrace because we ourselves chose the
    target . . . [and] a crushing political blow at home to the President
    linked with it, which the present White House incumbent has been from
    the inception,â€ wrote William J. Coughlin in Missiles and Rockets. He
    suggested a possible solution: â€œ. . . extend the US.national goal prior to
    a manned lunar landing by either the US. or the Soviet Union. Then, if
    the Russians were the first to arrive on the Moon, we would be in a
    position to gracefully acknowledge their achievement while pointing out
    that to us the Moon was but a way-station en route to a more distant
    objective. If we accomplished the first landing, we would also have the
    benefits of victory. But we would not be so exposed in the event of a
    defeat. . . .
        â€œWithout establishment of a higher goal and a greater challenge,
    U.S. space capability will dissipate. NASA efforts to prevent this by getting
     a worthwhile Apollo Applications Program under way have not met with
     notable success. This provides a second good reason for lifting our
     national goal. . . .â€ (Coughlin, M&R, 5/2/66, 46)

   munications satellites to raise standards of living in less-advanced
   nations-was discussed by Vincent P. Rock, director of Communications
   Central. He emphasized lack of literacy requirement for television
   instruction and noted that it could (1) â€œtransmit skills and knowledge
   required for modernization of productive activity; (2) transmit fantasy
   which helps a person understand the role and techniques of association
   required for participation in a modern society; and (3) transmit infor-
   mation about events and goods required for action in the modern world.â€

   system would cost about $30,000,000, excludingground receiving equip-
   ment, and could be ready in three years. Transmissions from satellites

       U S . should assume active world leadership in direct satellite-to-home
    radio and television broadcasts which offer tremendous potential for

   professor Richard N. Gardner in a panel discussion. Warning that
   several nations had already asked international bodies to outlaw general
    broadcasting from space for fear of â€œunilateral penetrationâ€ or unwanted
   propaganda, Gardner urged: (1) the Administration to proceed imme-
    diately in developing direct broadcast satellites; (2) the organization of a
   pilot demonstration project, perhaps in India, with U.N. endorsement;
    (3) the involvement of AID and other international lending agencies in
    educational use of space communications; and (4) the reassurance of
    friendly nations that comsats would not be used for propaganda.
       Murray L. Schwartz, Univ. of Calif. School of Law, told panel that
    satellites were one more example of a technology that might be moving
    too fast for existing social institutions. A â€œknowledge explosionâ€ heJped
    by space communications would accelerate homogenization of society
    and â€œone of the great problems is to make sure the homogenization is
    not too great,â€ he said. (Clark, NYT, 5/5/66, 17; Simons, Wush. Post,

    landing within this decade.
       â€œAt $4.8 billion the moon landing objective could not be met. Below

    Calif., to press group touring manufacturing and test sites for Apollo
    spacecraft and Saturn boosters. â€œThe Apollo program is about on
    schedule in time, cost and performance. We have found the performance
    of the hardware some better than we had expected, on the basis of tests.
    All testing for the first manned flight probably will be completed by
    the end of June.
        â€œI hope we can make the first manned flight this year, although it is
    not scheduled until next year. I think that the first lunar excursion

        C. R. Able, group vice president of Douglas Aircraft Co.â€™s Missile and
    Space Systems Div., outlined to the group plan for converting empty
    hydrogen tank from Saturn Vâ€™s 3rd stage into manned space capsule.
    For conversion, series of metal balloons containing liquid oxygen would
    be added to original orbited payload, to serve later for breathing and for
    combination with hydrogen to operate fuel cells for producing elec-
    tricity. An Apollo or Gemini spacecraft would dock with empty 3rd
    stage, and astronauts would emerge to remove end cover plate in end of
    the tank, after purging it of any hydrogen remaining from launch. An
    airlock, carried aloft as part of original payload or launched later, would
    be attached to opening left by removal of cover plate and tank would be
    repressurized with oxygen from metal balloons to provide astronauts
    with â€œshirtsleeve environment.â€ Tank walls would have about 100 shal-
    low threaded holes for mounting work benches, furniture, or other con-
    venient items, presumably launched separately. Able emphasized that
    purpose of stage conversion-to offer astronauts relief from cramped
    quarters and extended weightlessness-did not duplicate function of
    USAFâ€™S Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol). Douglas Aircraft Co.,
    McDonnell Aircraft Corp., and Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp.

       science and technology do increase the opportunity to make improve-

       :
    United Nations â€œlaying down rules and procedures for the exploration of
    celestial bodies.â€ He listed as â€œessential elementsâ€ of the proposed
    treaty: (1) the moon and other celestial bodies should be free for
    exploration and use by all countries; (2) no country should be permitted
    a claim of sovereignty; (3) there should be freedom of scientific investi-
    gation, and all countries should cooperate in scientific activities relating
    to celestial bodies; (4) efforts should be made to avoid harmful con-
    tamination; (5) astronauts of one country should give any necessary
    help to astronauts of another country; (6) no country should be permit-
    ted to station weapons of mass destruction on a celestial body; and (7)
    weapon tests and military maneuvers should be forbidden. (Text; Pres.
    Doc., 5/16/66, 622; NYT, 5/8/66, 66)
  Editorial comment on President Johnsonâ€™s proposal:
            . . . In addition to rules governing space exploration a body of law
        CC


    is needed to govern the exploitation of useful resources that may con-
     ceivably be found on other solar bodies. Omission of this topic from
     the first international treaty on space law could produce future dif-
     ficulties. But the President may well have felt that any present attempt
     to reach agreement on this delicate matter might prolong negotiations
                                                              ...
     beyond the time of the first manned Iunar landing.               There is no
     time to lose in getting international agreement to and ratification of this
     essential document.â€ (NYT, 5/9/66, 36)
            . . . Someday such a treaty may save us from a new sort of far-out
         Ce


     interplanetary imperialism. As revived by Mr. Johnson, however, the
     proposal has to do with a problem that will develop sooner and closer
     to home. After all between now and 1969 or 1970, Americans are going
     to be lofted to the moonâ€™s surface, and so are Russians. This is a pros-
     pect full of very great historic importance. It lends special force to the
                                            ..    . to negotiate an understanding
     Presidentâ€™s call for a renewed effort

   worthy of the name. . . .â€ (Wash. Eve. Star, 5/10/66, A6)
       â€œThe first manned landing on the moon seems likely before 1970.
   The implications are immense, regardless of whether the first one is
   American or Russian. President Johnsonâ€™s proposal for an international
    compact to govern this and outer space explorations makes much sense.
       â€œ. . .Perhaps a willingness by Moscow to entertain a treaty on space
   may also open the door to discussions about pooling some of the costs,
   as the late President Kennedy proposed.â€ (Boston Globe, 5/11/66)

       (C


    treaty of this nature is, â€˜Who needs it?â€™ Monopolization of the lunar
    surface by military units and establishment of terror weapons on the

       â€œThere is no slightest indication that the Russians propose to lay
    claim to the moon if their cosmonauts get there first, any more than
   we do if we win the race. The precedent followed by both countries in
    Antarctica-nearest thing to the moon on earth-is neither to assert
    nor to recognize territorial claims. This was U.S. and Soviet policy be-

 Lockheed Aircraft Corp. chairman Courtland S. Gross described flight

    an-hour speed will carry passengers to London and Paris in two and a
    half hours. With room for 255 to 266 passengers, five abreast, it will
    be a 222-foot walk from the tail to the pilotâ€™s cabin.
       â€œBut the biggest thrill will be cruising at 70,000 to 80,000 feet above
    the earth. At that height you will enjoy the kind of stars and sky seen
    heretofore only by U-2 pilots and astronauts-pinpoint icicles sus-
    pended in the blue-black velvet backdrop of space. Most of the at-
    mosphere is below the supersonic transportâ€™s cruising altitude, so that
    at night, on the horizon, there will be the bright blue band first re-
    ported by the astronauts-light radiating from the other side of the
    earth. When flying the polar routes around the world, passengers will
    enjoy spectacular electrical displays from the ionization of gases in

    sovereignty claims on the moon, Rep. George P. Miller (D-Calif.) told
    the House: â€œThe President has taken a very progressive and forward
    step . . . in trying to establish a barrier against the use of the moon or
    outer space as a place of contest for the nations of the world. He has
    asked that these areas be internationalized and we follow in space ex-
    ploration that principle which has been established already with re-
    spect to the use of nuclear wea ons.
       â€œThis is a great step forwarc f by the President, and we in the House
    should appreciate it, and commend him for it.â€ (CR, 5/9/66)
  Text of Soviet Academy of Sciencesâ€™ August 1965 proposal to International
    Astronomical Union (IAU) for an international effort to search for
    signals from other worlds was made public in Vienna. Proposal, which
    implied that peculiar objects such as quasars represented the kind of
    beacon a civilization with extraordinary capability might build, recom-
    mended two kinds of searches. First would look for narrow-band sig-
    nals which a â€œcivilization with the meager energy resources of earthâ€
    could send to another star. Concentration of the energy into narrow
    range of wavelengths would ensure signalsâ€™ survival for hundreds of
    light years. Search would be confined to 21-centimeter wavelength in
    the spectrum emitted throughout space by hydrogen.
       Second search would be for signals spanning much of the spectrum
    which a super civilization with the energy resources of a star would
    generate. Such signals would be difficult both to decode and recognize
    as artificial. Proposal, which recommended round-the-clock observa-
    tions for three to five years, would be discussed at IAU General As-
    sembly in Prague Aug. 22-31, 1967. (Sullivan, NYT, 5/10/66, 19)
  NASA Deputy Administrator Robert c. Seamans, Jr., said NASA would request

    ment that â€œApollo Applications will fill the post-Apollo gap and that
    there is no need to define another goal nowâ€™â€™ was said to conflict with the
    recent contention of Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Admin-
    istrator for Manned Space Flight, that a clear definition of the Nationâ€™s
    post-Apollo goal was necessary. (Av. Wk., 5/9/66,25)

May 10-19: 1966 Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) meeting was held
   in Vienna.
       National Academy of Sciences delegate Dr. Richard W. Porter, sum-
   marizing activities of 1965 U S . space program, said a manned lunar
   landing by 1970 would be a â€œdifficult goalâ€ but U S . had made â€œsub-
   stantial progress. ,â€™
       Dr. Porter presented an analysis of data transmitted by NASA MARINER
    IV Mars probe which appeared to support theory that earth sometimes
    has comet-like tail stretching past orbit of Mars. On Feb. 5, 1965, a
    peculiarly timed solar eruption sent series of intense proton clouds into
    space, five of which were detected within 48 hrs. by MARINER IV and two
    other U S . satellites in near-earth orbit. Second and third clouds were
    reported by MARINER IV three to five hours prior to their detection near
    earth, possibly because solar eruption had blown earthâ€™s tail to enormous
    length, forcing two clouds to detour through tail in order to penetrate
    earthâ€™s magnetic field. (Sullivan, NYT, 5/11/66, 16; Toth, Wash. Post,
    5/12/66, A14)
       Chief Soviet delegate Anatoli A. Blagonravov summarized 1965
    U.S.S.R. space program, and said LUNA x, which entered lunar orbit
    April 3, had recorded radiation pattern from lunar surface similar to
    that from basaltic part of earthâ€™s crust. Apparently lunar surface exhib-
    ited no differentiation equivalent to granite on earth, indicating that
    earth and moon were created separately. LUNA x had found level of
    moonâ€™s magnetic field barely above that of interplanetary space; small
    increase was attributed to moonâ€™s passing through earthâ€˜s magnetic tail
    at time of measuremeat. Im lication was that moon is coId throughout,
                                f
    since liquid metal core wou d produce large magnetic field. Report sug-
    gested that new minerals would be found on the moon because of
    unusual chemical reactions caused by its extreme temperature range,
    the impacts of micrometeorites, and rains of high-energy radiation.

       Soviet delegate A. G. Prishchep, in a joint paper with colleague V. I.
    Vashkov, revealed that U.S.S.R. planetary probes were assembled in
    clean rooms and sterilized with two-fold process involving moist heat to
    prevent dryness and a gas mixture, harmless to the skin, which might
    have important surgical applications. Gas mixture contained 50% ethyl-
    ene oxide-extremely poisonous substance which is dangerously
174                 ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

      explosive when combined with oxygen-diluted with 40% methyl
      bromide for safety reasons.
         General Electric scientists H. G. Lorsch and M. 6. Koesterer reported
      that current sterilization cycles varied from treatment at 320â€ for three
      hours to baking at 200Â°F for 14 days. They argued that no more than 10
      billion microbes should exist within a spacecraft prior to beginning of
      sterilization if reasonable chance of killing virtually all of them was to be
      assured. (Sullivan, NYT, 5/12/66, 79; Beller, M&R, 5/16/66, 17-18)
         Drs. Herbert Friedman and R. W. Kreplin, Naval Research Labora-
      tory, reported that solar radiation level would probably exceed highest
      ever recorded in 100 yrs. during 1969-1970-time of first projected
      manned lunar landing. Basing their prediction on measurements of
      solar x-ray emissions taken by EXPLORER xxx (IQSY Solar Explorer)
      satellite, Friedman and Kreplin explained that x-rays, which could not
      penetrate earthâ€˜s atmosphere, warned of approaching sunspots before
      they could be seen. Solar activities in the form of sunspots and gaseous
      flares occurred in 11-12yr. cycles, but there was also a gross cycle which
      reaches its greatest intensity every 80 to 100 yrs. (Sullivan, NYT,

         Dr. Bessel Kok, Research Institute for Advanced Studies, described
      a small instrument which could determine the existence of life when
      landing on another planet. Designed on the assumption that even the
      simplest forms of life use water and such common chemical compounds
      as phosphates and nitrates, device would trace the transfer of nonradio-
      active isotope-Oxygen 18-from these chemicals to water. ( Wush.

      ECHO I and ECHO II comsats in coordination with Soviet expeditionary
      stations in Egypt and Mali; (5) Sweden, Finland, Russia, and East
      Europeans had joined in observing orbital flight changes of ECHO I and
      ECHO 11 attributable to density variations in wisps of air at satellite
      altitude; and (6) East German scientists reported their conclusions on
      upper air structure derived from real-time transmissions from NASA

          Dr. A. I. Lebedensky, Soviet Academy of Sciences, reported that
      LUNA IX photos revealed lunar surface was steadily eroding, at least in
       some places. He suggested that erosion could be caused by solar winds
       or impact of micrometeorites. Lebedensky pointed out two peculiar
       features on LUNA IXâ€™S photos which supported his theory. First was
       series of streaks, resembling mineral veins in earthâ€™s bedrock, on floor
       of crater where LUNA IX had landed. It had previously been assumed that
       moonâ€™s surface was buried deep in debris churned up by meteorite im-
       pacts. Second was presence of rock-like objects on small pedestals
                                                                           175
                  ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

    similar to those on earth where soft but rock-strewn surface had been
    eroded. Stones, which ranged in size from one foot to less than one inch
    across and whose pedestals appeared as high as they were wide, â€œwere
    the most unexpected and important result of the flight,â€ Lebedensky
    said. â€œOur conclusion is that the stone is harder than the ground around
    it and screens the ground underneath from the erosion effects of solar
    winds and micrometeorites.â€ Lebedensky admitted the possibility that
    erosion was peculiar to the crater or a particular region of the moon,
    but saw no obvious reason why this should be true. (Sullivan, NYT,

    was nearest earth indicated prorninences with the ability to depolarize
    microwaves. â€œThey may well be mountain ranges,â€ Dr. Goldstein said,

    of space, the moon and the planets is potentially the greatest inspira-
    tional venture in the history of man, and one in which the entire world
     can share. Thus, the exploration of the space frontier can well provide
     the seed for new floweringsparking a Twentieth Century Renaissance,

May 14: USAF launched two unidentified satellites from WTR with Atlas-Agena
    D booster. (U.S. Aeron. & Space Act., 1966, 150)
Muy 15: NASA NIMBUS 11 (Nimbus C) meteorological satellite was launched
    from WTR with Thrust-Augmented Thor-Agena B booster into near-polar
    orbit with 730-mi. (1,175-km.) apogee, 678-mi. (1,091-km.) perigee,
    108-min. period, and 80â€ inclination. Flight plan had called for 600-mi.-
    altitude orbit.
       NIMBUS 11, three-axis earth-stabilized R&D weather satellite, would
    flight-test basic technology essential to meteorological satellites and
    instrumentation necessary to study atmospheric structure. It would also
    extend meteorologicalobservation to region of electromagneticspectrum
    not previously covered. Satellite carried Advanced Vidicon Camera
    System (Avcs) and Automatic Picture Transmission System (Apt), both
    of which operate during daylight portion of each orbit; Medium Resolu-
    tion Infrared Radiometer (Mrir) to store global medium resolution data
    on earthâ€™s heat balance; and High Resolution Infrared Radiometer
     (Hrir) to provide high-resolution nighttime cloud-cover photos and
    cloud-top temperatures. Addition of Hrir data to Apt system was initial
    demonstration of stored and direct readout day-night cloud coverage
    capability. 3,000 weather photos would be taken daily by 912-lb. satellite
    and transmitted to any of 150 Apt stations around the world-eight of
    which had been modified to obtain nighttime cloud cover. Second in
    NASAâ€™S Nimbus series of meteorologicalsatellites, NIMBUS 11 was managed
    by GSFC under overall direction of NASA OSSA. (NASA Proj. Off.; Oâ€™Toole,

e Soviet space doctorsâ€™ examination of dogs Ugolyek and Veterok after their
     22-day flight in COSMOS c x d u r i n g which they had been harnessed and
     force-fed through stomach tubes-indicated          that prolonged stay in
     space produced functional changes in animals which increased upon
     return to earth and then gradually disappeared. X-rays of dogsâ€™ skeletal
     systems showed that calcium had been â€œwashed out.â€ Muscle mass had
     changed, preventing full resumption of normal motor activity until
     eight or 10 days after return. High pulse rates and dehydration-find-
     ings common to both U.S.S.R. and U S . manned experiments-were
     observed, and on fourth to fifth day after dogsâ€™ return there was â€œrather
     considerable speedupâ€ of erythrocyte sedimentation reaction and an
     increase in number of Ieucocptes in blood, both apparently in response
     to normal gravity. In summary, doctors said that while functional
     changes did occur during flight, they were not irreversible. Whether or
     not zero gravity could change functional state of organism to extent
     that it could not return to normal was not yet known. (Tass, 5/16/66,

May 17: Gemini IX mission was scrubbed when Atlas booster failed to place
    Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (Gatv) in planned 185-mi. (298-km.) cir-

    reasons were cited: (1) to avoid conflicts over them between nations;
     (2) to keep their resources from being wasted; (3) to prevent their
    military use; (4) to prevent their contamination; (5) to ensure that
    all nations benefit from their resources; and (6) to provide the U.N.
    with an independent source of income.
        Report continued: â€œMember nations are not willing to pay assess-
    ments adequate for the task they expect the United Nations to per-
    form. The revenues of the United Nations must therefore be augmented
    by independent sources of income. No one can estimate now what
     the income of the United Nations might be from its granting licenses
    for the exploitation of the resources of the seas and the revenues
    which should accrue to it from outer space communications. It is
     estimated, however, that the amount of money to be realized certainly
     should make an important contribution to the United Nations budget.

                                                  ..
    the cost of the lost hardware plus overhead. .
       â€œOne thing should be clear from the experience of Gemini 9.
       â€œThere was nothing of omission or commission that can be charged
    against NASA in the failure of the Agenaâ€™s Atlas launching rocket. If
    the hackneyed phrase â€˜random failureâ€™ ever was properly used, it was
    in describing yesterdayâ€™s trouble.
       â€œThe Atlas, as a standard space launching vehicle, has had 49 suc-
    cesses in 52 attempts over the last three years-a better success record
    than the over-all American space program has enjoyed in any year since

* Editorial comment on May 17 scrubbing of Gemini IX mission: New York
    Times: â€œFor the third time in the past few months, a space experiment
    involving the Atlas-Agena rocket has run into trouble. Late last year a
    sequence of events similar to yesterdayâ€™s led to a postponement of the
    original Gemini rendezvous experiment, while in March of this year,
    Gemini 8 nearly met catastrophe when it was docked with an Agena
    target vehicle. There may well be no connection between these three
    separate incidents; but since the Atlas-Agena has been a highly reliable
    and successful instrument in other aspects of the nationâ€™s space pro-
                                                                         183

   gram, its emergence as the weak link in the Gemini series poses some-
    thing of a mystery. The setback caused by last yearâ€™s failure to orbit
    an Agena target vehicle was made up for by the brilliant improvisation
    that permitted Geminis 6 and 7 to rendezvous Iast December. Warned
    by that earlier experience, space officials were better prepared for this
    latest setback. The substitute target rocket they have on hand may per-
    mit much of the originally planned Gemini 9 experiment to take place

    cannot logically expect this luck to last forever. Progress in space, as
    with nearly all human progress, will come at the cost of menâ€™s lives.

    Among findings reported during probeâ€™s 260 million mi. of travel:
    exact measurement of average numbers of particles in interplanetary
    space; fact that high-energy particles thrown out by solar flares (princi-
    pal radiation hazard to man) traveled in well-defined streams which were
    twisted about one another; and solar wind did not travel in straight
    lines. PIONEER VI had identified new ion (singly ionized helium) in solar
    wind, had found magnetic-field effects on solar wind temperatures, and
    discovered that sunâ€™s magnetic field occurred in filament-like â€œstringersâ€
    extending out from its corona. Spacecraft had revealed that regions on
    sun produced many solar flares and high solar wind velocities, as re-
    ported by MARINER IV. During its 154 days in solar orbit, spacecraft had
    transmitted to earth 340 million readings of 3,000 separate scientific
    measurements and sent back 3 million readings of 100 individual en-
    gineering measurements. Specifications called for operating life of six

May 19: William Hines charged in Washington Evening Star that publicity
    given to proposed U S . supersonic transport (Sst) was â€œ. . . part of a
     propaganda barrage aimed at the American taxpayer, who in the years
     ahead will be called upon to underwrite deficits clearly predictable in
     building and operating a costly fleet of airplanes capable of spanning the
     Atlantic in two hours.
        â€œThe SST program has been publicized since the programâ€™s inception
     in 1963 with the same combination of gobbledygook and public-relations
     hokum used so successfully in merchandising the moon program.
     Technological challenge, the asserted psychological-spiritual imperative,
     and the added spur of an international â€˜raceâ€™-all are cited as reasons
     compelling development of a 2,000-mile-an-hoursuper-airliner.
        â€œActually the SST, when built and placed in operation, will be no more
     a free-enterprise product than the Saturn-5 moon rocket is. It will be
     built to government specifications, by contractors selected by the govern-
     ment, with development costs largely if not entirely underwritten by
     the government.â€ (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 5/19/66)

May 20: Checks of distributions of Martian and lunar crater diameters in-
    dicated that the visible surface of Mars was 2.2-to-3 X 109 years old,
    Alan B. Binder, Univ. of Arizona, reported in Science. This result im-
    plied that in the early history of Mars large-scale subaerial erosion oc-
    curred. Of 69 Martian craters with diameters greater than 10 km., 13%
    had central peaks. This compared favorably with the frequency (11.7%)
    of central peaks among lunar craters and may indicate the peaks re-
    sulted from the impact mechanism rather than post-impact volcanism.
    Well-defined system of lineaments shown in MARINER IV photographs
    may indicate that Mars had lost appreciable angular momentum during
    its history. (Binder, Science, 5/20/66, 1053-5)

May 23: Important information on one of several x-ray sources, observable

    stellation Scorpius, Sco X-1, could not exceed 20 arc-seconds. This
    discovery disagreed with widely held view that this source represented
    an ancient nearby (Milky Way) supernova. It strengthened current
    speculation that the sources in Scorpio and many of the other x-ray
    sources are an entirely new class of celestial objects characterized by
    small angular size which are either undetectable or star-like in visible
    light or radio emission. The detail with which the angular size of this

     â€œspace buses.â€ First flight, in 1969, would be of an 850-lb. spacecraft
     that would provide televised mapping of the Mars surface and take
     measurements of the atmosphere. After a series of intermediary
     flights, the space buses would land in 1979 and release both automated
    biological laboratories and roving vehicles that would explore and
    gather samples at points away from the immediate landing area.
        Dr. Norman H. Horowitz of JPL noted that â€œany form of life, however
    primitive, found on Mars would be of immense scientific value.â€ He
     said that no matter how bleak the picture, the possibilities of life on
     Mars should be explored to the fullest because that planet appeared
     to be the likeliest site for life beyond the earth.

    of orbital bombs, missiles that could â€˜hit a fly in the sky,â€™ and similar
     weapons. Today, by contrast, the Soviets are not boasting about their

     new weapon developments.          The second constraint is the argument
    made in some quarters that U S . military research and development
     could be â€˜provocativeâ€™ to our opponents. This argument overlooks the
     fact that our very existence as a free society is â€˜provocativeâ€™ to our

     opponents, because it contradicts their theory of history.            The
     third constraint is the immediate need for large funds to support our
     forces in Vietnam.. . .,, To overcome these constraints, General
     Schriever said, â€œwe must harness our management experience and

Muy 25: NASA successfully launched EXPLORER XXXII (AE-B) aeronomy
   satellite from ETR with three-stage Delta booster. The 2nd stage burned
   8 sec. longer than planned-failing to cut off and running to propellant
   depletion-and boosted the satellite into a higher orbit than planned.
   Orbital parameters: apogee, 1,688 mi. (2,717.7 km.), as opposed to
   planned 750 mi.; perigee, 180 mi. (289.8 km.) ; period, 116 min.; inclina-
   tion to equator, 65â€. Launch was third time Delta 2nd stage had failed
   to shut down on time and sent 3rd stage and payload to higher altitudes.
      Built by GSFC, and the last of the original satellites outlined by NASA
   when it was established in 1958, the 495-1b., 35-in.- dia. EXPLORER XXXII
   was designed to investigate temperatures, composition, densities, and
   pressure in the upper atmosphere and their diurnal, seasonal, and
   annual variations on a global basis. NASA later announced that adjust-
   ment of onboard programing of spacecraftâ€™s sensors had compensated
   for higher apogee and useful scientific measurements would be taken
   that were not planned originally. All eight experiments onboard were
   functioning â€œas expectedâ€ and spacecraft was spin stabilized at the
   required 30 rpm.
      First aeronomy satellite, EXPLORER XVII, was launched April 3, 1563.
   Results included first direct measurement of neutral helium; first in
   situ measurements of concentrations of neutral atmospheric constit-
   uents at satellite altitudes as a function of time and solar activity; first
   data revealing difference by a factor of two (approx.) in value for atmos-
   pheric density as determined from onboard sensors and from changes in
   satelliteâ€™s orbit; first detailed description of diurnal and latitudinal
   behavior of summer ionosphere near altitude of F, maximum over

May 25: Fifth anniversary of President John ? .?Kennedyâ€™s call before a joint
    session of Congress to undertake a manned lunar landing in this
    decade.
0 Referring to President Kennedyâ€™s challenge five years ago â€œto achieving

    the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and
    returning him safely to earth,â€ William Hines commented in the
    Washington Evening Star on the progress made:â€œOf course, Kennedy
    did not â€˜inventâ€™ space. Nor did he, in a single 1,100-word exhortation
    to Congress, create all the conditions needed to make a lunar program
    possible. The United States had quite a respectable space effort going
    for several years before Kennedy spoke, and indeed the first American
    astronaut had flown a brief suborbital mission three weeks earlier.
        â€œThe foundations on which Kennedy could build a moon program
    were there. What he did-with advice and urging from many advisers
    including the then Vice President Johnson and the late â€˜grand old
                                                        .
    man of space,â€™ Hugh L. Dryden-was set a goal. . .
        â€œThe call to leadership in space came at a particularly troublous
    time in the new Kennedy administrationâ€™s development. In the month
    just past, April 1961, the United States had suffered two tremendous
    setbacks in what had been called â€˜the battle for menâ€™s minds.â€™ On
    April 12 Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin orbited the earth-a full 10 months,
    as it turned out, before Astronaut John Glenn would match his feat.
    And on April 19 the bottom fell out of the ill-conceived Bay of Pigs
    adventure to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba.â€ (Hines, Wash. Eve.

0 USAF Flight Safety Review Board announced it had pinpointed cause of

     the Atlas booster failure during the aborted Gemini IX mission May 17:
     gimbaling of the booster engine which forced the Atlas-Agena into a
    hardover trajectory was caused by a short circuit in the electrical
     command system of the engine pitch servo valve. Although several
     other failures could have caused a similar occurrence, the Board said,
     only this one could have caused the exact set of data received from the
     launch vehicle. Malfunction was called a random failure, but to ensure
     that it would not happen again, new tests would be made on the Atlas
     and electrical connections in all new boosters would be x-rayed.
        NASA scheduled the mission, redesignsted Gemini IX-A, for June 1.

    consider the nations1 security, or peace-keeping, aspects.
       â€œAlthough our space program is a peaceful endeavor, it cannot help
   but have a profound effect on our future military position. Although
    there is no military space force in being in any nationâ€™s arsenal, it
    would be disastrous for the United States to lack the basic understand-
    ing, the basic technology, and the basic engineering which would be
   required if an aggressor should choose to make space a battlefield.. . .
       â€œIn the international arena, our space program-and Manned Space
    Flight in particular-may be considered as a measure of our ability to
    compete with a formidable rival, and as a criterion of our ability to
   maintain technological eminence.
       â€œThe influence of our scientific and technological progress and
   prowess is and has been one of the deciding factors in keeping the

     CC
      major spacefaring nation,â€ and must be found within a year, he said-
   long before the first lunar landing yas made. Search for the answer
    had been postponed several times because the problem seemed remote
    and budgets were tight. â€œIt is extremely important not to think you
    can postpone the decision again. I think it is imperative to have a
    thoroughgoing national debate on whether we want to go past the
    point of no return.â€ If the Nation did not mind being second to the
    moon or chose to â€œdismantle the Apollo machine without recovering
   its great investment,â€ he would accept that, he said. But he did not
    believe that either the Congress or the public had consciously reached
    these decisions. He feared they just had not thought about them.

    defense policy-making, he said: â€œFirst, the scientist, operating at the
    frontiers of knowledge, may have anticipated many political and military
    problems posed by scientific advance. Second, military necessity made
    the scientist a leader in applying sophisticated rational and mathematical
    analysis to the solution of some problems-especially resource allocation
    -which have been generated by scientific advance.
        â€œAt the same time it must be acknowledged that advice from scientists
    had been far from infallible, especially where the advice touches upon
    aspects of a larger problem on which the specialist is less expert, and in
    some cases, may not even be fully informed.â€ (NATOâ€™s Fijteen Nations,

    Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.) cited recent approach by Subcommittee
    in reallocation of funds during hearings on NASA FY 1967 authorization:
    â€œThe Congress makes resources available for our national space program

0 Revolution in military communications â€œto which we are now fully com-
    mitted and which we are actively pursuing,â€ was discussed by William
    Beecher in Astronautics & Aeronautics: â€œAt this writing, the Pentagon
    plans a May launch of the first eight of a series of 14 to 22 repeater
    satellites in its Initial Defense Communications Satellite Project (Idcsp) .
    The first eight, riding piggyback on a Titan 111-C test booster, will be
    deposited into random orbits about 21,000 mi. up. Within 60 days
    thereafter, another six repeater satellites together with two gravity-
    gradient experimental satellites will be similarly orbited. If all 14 of the
    communications satellites function perfectly, sufficient coverage will be
    provided to obviate the need for a third shot of eight, Pentagon experts
    Sa?;
         Although meant primarily to perfect the technology of space com-
    munications, after a relatively short test-only period, this Idcsp would
    be made available â‚¬or high-priority worldwide military traffic-for in-
    stance, important communications between Washington and Saigon. . . .
        â€œThen, in 1969 or 1970, the Defense Department hopes to put up a
    fully operational system, called the Advanced Defense Communications
     Satellite Project (Adcsp). As John S. Foster, Jr., Director of Defense
    Research and Engineering, described it in recent Congressional testi-
    mony, â€˜This system will take advantsge of advances in both booster and
     communications technology which will permit the establishment of an
     economical, highly reliable system capable of providing many secure,
    jam-resistant, long-range communications circuits to support vital
     security operations wherever they occur.â€™ â€ (Beecher, A&A, 5/66, 10)

June 2-14: NASA SURVEYOR I became first US. spacecraft to softland on the
     moon when it touched down in the Ocean of Storms and began trans-
     mitting the first of its more than 10,000 clear and detailed television
     pictures to JPL Deep Space Facilities, Goldstone, Calif.
          Landing sequence began 2,000 mi. above moon when, traveling at
     6,000 mph, SURVEYOR I shifted its normal cruising attitude to position
     main retrorocket. Triggered by radar ejected at 52-mi. altitude, main
     retrorocket burned until 37,000-ft. altitude, slowing craft to 400 mph.
     After retrorocket burnout, smaller guidance rockets ignited, slowing
     SURVEYOR I to 3% mph at 14-ft. altitude. Craft then free-fell to lunar
     surface at 8 mph. Landing-so precise that spacecraftâ€™s three footpads
     touched lunar surface within 19 millisec. of each other-confirmed
     that lunar surface could support Apollo Lunar Excursion Module
      (Lem) and proved concept of automatically decelerating a spacecraft
     from 6,000-mph speed to touchdown speed of 3% mph.
          Photos transmitted by SURVEYOR I before its camera was secured
     after sunset of first lunar day (June 14) revealed nearly level lunar
     surface littered with rock fragments [see During June]. â€œRubble
     scattered over the surface is probably a fairly general characteristic
     all over the           NASA Surveyor Project Scientist Dr. Leonard Jaffe
      told JPL press conference.

      gas from spacecraftâ€™s attitude control jets showed no disturbance of
      the lunar surface. In addition to wide- and narrow-angle lurain photo-

     as command pilot and Eugene A. Cernan, pilot, was successfully
     launched from ETR by Titan I1 booster on GEMINI IX-A mission to
     evaluate extravehicular life-support and maneuvering equipment and
     procedures, and to rendezvous and dock with Augmented Target Dock-
     ing Adapter (ATDA), launched from ETR June 1. Initial orbit: 174-mi.
      (280-km.) apogee; 99-mi. (159-km.) perigee; 90-min. period; and 30â€
     inclination. At T-3 ground communications system malfunction which
     had postponed June 1launch recurred, but alternate procedures proved
     satisfactory and countdown continued.
         At 49 min. GET Stafford executed first course correction to position
     GEMINI IX for rendezvous, firing thruster rockets to raise perigee to
      134 mi. After two more orbital maneuvers, spacecraft was within 25 ft.
     of target. Stafford, sighting ATDA, confirmed suspicions that its shroud
     had not jettisoned, and docking would be impossible. He radioed ground
      control: â€œIt looks like an angry alligator out there.â€ NASA later revealed
      that shroud had not jettisoned because technicians, following â€œinsuffi-
      ciently detailedâ€ written instructions, had installed lanyards improperly.
         Complying with modified flight plan, astronauts photographed ATDA,
      executed re-rendezvous maneuver, and executed rendezvous-from-
      above simulating Lunar Excursion Module (Lem) abort from the moon.
      After this maneuver, which depleted fuel supply to 11%-only 6%
     more than minimum reserve-Stafford and Cernan were fatigued and
      recommended 24-hr. postponement of Cernanâ€™s walk in space.
         At 11:02 a.m. EST June 5, Cernan opened hatch of depressurized
      spacecraft, climbed out, and retrieved micrometeoroid impact detector
      attached to side. He moved to full length of 25-ft. tether to take photos.
      After one hour, Cernan returned to Adapter Section to don Astronaut
      Maneuvering Unit (Amu)-a task which required â€œfour or five times
      more work than anticipated.â€ His faceplate visor began clouding over,
      presumably because environmental control system was not absorbing
      moisture quickly enough. Cernanâ€™s limited visibility and discovery
      that Amuâ€™s radio transmissions were garbled forced Stafford to recall
      him to spacecraft. He had been scheduled to disconnect from GEMINI IXâ€™S
      oxygen supply and maneuver in Amu to 150 ft. from spacecraft.
         Reentry on June 6 was normal. At 1O:OO a.m. EST, in the 46th
      revolution, GEMINI IX impacted 345 mi. east of Cape Kennedy-less
                                                                          207

        Accomplishments of GEMINI M-A mission were summarized by. Dr.
     George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
     Flight, at MSC news conference: (1) demonstration of three new
     rendezvous procedures-catching        target in only three revolutions,
     locating it without radar, and approaching it from above rather than
     below; (2) accurately controlled reentry; (3) longest period of extra-
     vehicular activities-over two hours; (4) new information on manâ€™s
     ability to work in space necessary for manned lunar landing and for
     assembling stations in space; and (5) new information on manned
     observation of another spacecraft in orbit. Five experiments were
     successfully performed in accordance with modified flight plan. Con-
     cerning missionâ€™s disappointments, he said: â€œWe will try to do as
     much as we can on each of our Gemini flights. We wonâ€™t always succeed
     in meeting all of the objectives. But we learned a great deal about the
     problems that do occur during the course of one of these very difficult
     space missions.â€ (NASA Proj. Off.; NASA Release 66-97; Wilford, NYT,

     analyzed the areas of relative accomplishment: â€œ(1)Number o space- f
     craft. The United States has placed dmost 400 spacecraft into earth
     orbit and on escape missions, while the USSR has put slightly less than
     200 on such missions.. . . However. . . Soviets have placed each year
     a greater total weight of payloads. . . . (2) Lunar and Interplanetary.
     The United States has been far less active but considerably more success-
     ful in its interplanetary activities. . . . We have photographed Mars and
     had a productive flyby of Venus while the USSRâ€™s      active interplanetary
     program has been primarily plagued by failure. In addition, we have
     taken some 17,000 photographs of the moon and are taking hundreds
     more by the magnificent Surveyor spacecraft. . . . (3) Manned Flight
     . . .U.S. . . . has a distinct lead over the USSR with about 1500 man
     flight hours in orbit compared with about 500. . . with the longest
     individual flight as well as the longest extra-vehicular activity. Also,
     the U S . has had two controlled rendezvous maneuvers, one docking
     experiment, and considerable manned spacecraft maneuvering experi-
     ence. So far, the USSR has achieved none of these latter goals. (4) Space
     Applications. The United States has navigation, weather, and com-
     munications satellite systems in regular operation, while the USSR is
     still in the developmental stage in such activities. (5) Scientijc Data. . .
     the larger number and greater variety of US. scientific payloads, as well
     as the wider and freer dissemination of the information obtained, may

    NASA Assistant Administrator for Public Mairs, in memorandum from
    Project Designation Committee: (1) Lunar Excursion Module wodd be
    known as â€œLunar Moduleâ€; (2) Saturn IB booster would be â€œUprated
    Saturn Iâ€; and (3) Saturn V stages (S-11, S-IC, and S-IVB) would be
    â€œfirst, second, and third stages.â€ Technical designations for Saturn
    stages, Scheer said, were confusing to the public and would be dropped

During June: Lurain as seen by SURVEYOR I Science Evaluation Analysis
     Team after preliminary analysis of data was a dark, relatively smooth,
     gently rolling plain â€œthe consistency of a freshly turned field,â€ studded
     with craters ranging in diameter from one inch to several hundreds of
     feet and littered with fragmental debris ranging in size from few hun-
     dredths of an inch to more than three feet. Dr. Eugene Shoemaker,
     U.S. Geological Survey, said terrestrial scenery most closely resembling
     the lurain as seen by SURVEYOR I would be Sedan crater at AECâ€™S Nevada
     Test site-large crater covered with small craters and â€œsecondary
     ejectaâ€ resulting from explosion of subsurface nuclear device. Lurain
     appeared to be composed of soil-like substance, or a fine sand, with
     rougher material through it. It appeared to be about three feet deep
     with harder surface beneath. Surface had dynamic bearing strength of
     6-10 psi. Leonard Jaffe, NASA Pr6ject Surveyor scientist, noted that
     results of SURVEYOR I could be summarized by list of previous theories
     on nature of lurain that had been disproved: surface was not composed
     of hard rock; it was not composed of one piece of very porous rock; it
     was not covered by a layer of loose dust either thick or thin; it was a
     finely granulated material with particles that cohered to each other but
     did not seem particularly attracted to spacecraft; it was heavy enough
     for man to walk and work on and for a properly designed spacecraft to
     land on; and it reflected accurate radar signal from surface, not from
     subsurface substance. Jaffe noted there were a few hazards to manned
     spacecraft, mostly from large rocks and possibility of sinkage, but
     emphasized data so far indicated surface was adequate for landing
      Apollo Lem.
        There appeared to be two different types of rocks near SURVEYOR I:
      one with pitted, spongy surface that appeared to be caused by molten
      rock that had cooled and from which gas had escaped; the other harder,
      smoother surfaced, and smaller grained.
        SURVEYOR I photographs were considered superior to U.S.S.R.â€™s LUNA
      IX results because (1) camera was higher so that horizon was 10 times
     farther away; (2) camera resolution was greater (down to 1/50th of an
      inch); camera worked longer and took more photos under different
     light angles. SURVEYOR 1â€™s pictures of its own footpad had yielded data
      on surface and subsurface composition. (Clark, NYT, 6/8/66, 1;

During June: NASA Deputy Administrator Robert C. Seamans, Jr., writing
    in Astronautics & Aeronautics, outlined choices in â€œpotential manned-
    spaceflight missions of the next generationâ€ and argued for taking up
    the preliminary options now. He selected what he called â€œthree natural,
    potential targetsâ€ for major extensions of manned space flight. First
    of these he saw as â€œa spacefaring research and operations center in
    earth orbit,â€ described as a â€œlarge, permanent, manned space facilityâ€
    that would â€œmake possible whole new ranges of experiments, investiga-
    tions, and operations.â€ Second choice was â€œthe moon itself. . .following
    up the initial exploratory landings with a permanent lunar base.â€ Third
    objective could be â€œmanned surface exploration of Marsâ€ within con-
    text of â€œextension of the lunar-landing experience to the near planets.â€
    Citing both advantages and difficulties of the latter, he said: â€œSuch an
    effort would represent a greater national commitment of far longer
    duration than our commitment in 1961 to a manned lunar landing, and
    would generate proportionately increased industrial, university, and
    government activities. Significant advances in virtually every field of
    space-related technology would be required. The increase in scientific
    knowledge from direct, firsthand observation and experimentation on
    another planet, however, has not yet been measured against the direct
    cost of its achievement, or against the more subtle cost of longterm
    dedication to a given course of action, with its inherent loss of national
    flexibility in allocation of the limiting resources-technical and scien-
    tific manpower.â€ ( A M , 6/66, 30-33)

     radiation and magnetic fields, Because tracking data indicated at 3:30
     GET spacecraft was in excess-energy orbit, alternate mission plan was
     put into effect at 4:30 GET: retrorocket was fired, injecting EXPLORER
     XXXIII into elliptical earth orbit with 278,990-mi. (449,174-km.) apogee;

     booster's 2nd stage had produced 70-80 fps over-velocity which would
     have caused spacecraft to reach moon's vicinity too early to achieve
     lunar capture. Despite EXPLORER XXXIII'S failure to achieve lunar orbit,

     that would have landed during lunar night rather than preferred day-
     light opportunity, to ensure that U.S. achieved first soft-landing before
     U.S.S.R. (Av.Wk., 7/4/66, 15)
July 4: Soviet tests of carrier rockets begun April 24 â€œto develop new space
     systemsâ€ had been completed, Tass announced. Conducted in the
     Pacific in two areas west and northwest of Midway Island, tests were to
     have ended July 31; early completion was not explained. (AP, NYT,

e NAAâ€™S Rocketdyne Div. reported single J-2 rocket engine had operated
     continuously for 635.9 sec.-more than two minutes longer than burn
     time required for an Apollo lunar launch. Test firing was one of a series
     of 104 during which engine had accumulated a total of 12,120 set.-
     more than three times engineâ€™s specified operating life. (Tech. Wk.,

July 5: NASAâ€™s Apollo/Saturn AS-203 mission was successfully launched
     from Complex 37 down ETR to obtain flight information on 2nd stage
      (S-IVB) and instrument unit (Iu), which reflected Saturn V configura-
     tion as nearly as possible. Two-stage Uprated Saturn I (Saturn IB)
     launch vehicle boosted unmanned payload composed of S-IVB stage,
     Iu, and nose cone into 117-mi.-altitude circular orbit (88.21-min. period,
     31.94â€™ inclination). S-IVB engine burned once in earthâ€™s atmosphere
     and was shut down. Engineâ€™s capability to restart after coast, as would
     be necessary during the Apollo mission, was demonstrated. No re-
     ignition was planned on this mission. Photos of liquid hydrogen fuel
     behavior were transmitted to four ground stations by one operable TV
      camera; attempts to repair malfunctioning second camera before launch
     had failed. During fourth orbit, while performing pressure differential
      test of S-IVB stage common bulkhead, internal pressure in the stage
      built up â€œwell in excess of design values,â€ and the stage fragmented.
         Initial evaluation of flight data indicated that all mission objectives
      were attained. Success of mission--second of three preliminary missions
      preceding first manned Apollo flight-was critical in meeting lunar
      exploration timetable. 58,500-133. S-IVB, heaviest satellite ever orbited
      by the US., was developed by MSFC and launched by KSC under direction
      of NASA Hq. OMSF. (NASA Proj. Off.; NASA Release 66-157; Wilford, NYT,

      supersonic transport Concorde would have to be flight-controlled by
      U.S. satellite when it entered service within the next decade. (UPI,

    research. Designated ccMicroeye,â€™â€™camera measured 1% in. by 4% in.,
     weighed less than 1% lbs., and was powered by small rechargeable
    battery. One camera, which included low-power transmitter and could
    telecast distances up to 100 ft., was delivered to NASA Hq. OART to
     evaluate possible applications in biotechnology and human research
     work. Second camera, connected by wire to a monitor screen, was
     delivered to MSFC to evaluate potential use with more powerful trans-
     mitter for monitoring functioning of launch vehicle subsystems.

July 6-21: NASAâ€™s   SURVEYOR I, resting on the moon, revived and responded
     to signals from Tidbinbilla, Australia, tracking station after inactivity
     during two weeks of lunar night and one week of morning sunlight.
     Responding to command, spacecraft angled its solar panel toward sun to
     receive more operating power and began transmitting engineering data.
     Within a few hours after first response, it was declared â€œa fully opera-
     tional spacecraftâ€; its battery was recharging; its transmitters, receivers,
     and command system were working; and machinery that moved its solar
     energy collector and high-gain antenna had been exercised. Performance
     amazed JPL officials who doubted spacecraft could survive the -260â€
     cold of lunar night.
         Spacecraft continued to perform satisfactorily for two days until
     rapid temperature rise in battery, apparently caused by short circuit,
     threatened to end spacecraftâ€™s life. Temperature was rising at 3â€ per
     hour, and reached 141Â°F. Near-fatal temperature subsided by July 10 to
     115Â°F and SURVEYOR I later transmitted 257 photos-including pictures
     of a shattered glass mirror on metal box containing its battery. BOXwas
     insulated to maintain temperature between 40Â°C and 125Â°C; segments
     of mirrored glass helped radiate away heat produced when instruments
     were operating. JPL officials believed shattering was caused by combined
     stresses of heat at lunar noontime and cold during lunar night rather
     than by impact of meteorites or heat from inside compartment.
         Unexpectedly long life of SURVEYOR I ended July 14 after spacecraft
     transmitted 9 out of 10 photos commanded by Johannesburg tracking
     station to search for traces of lunar atmosphere that might scatter light
     from ring of gases erupting from the sun. JPL officially terminated mis-
     sion July 21; spacecraftâ€™s solar panels would be checked during next
     period of advantageous sunlight direction, around Aug. 2, to determine
     if SURVEYOR I were transmitting again. Other checks would be made
     later to assure that spacecraftâ€™s transmissions would not interfere with
      Surveyor B, scheduled for launch in fall 1966. (Miles, Wash. post,

Jdy 8 Mars polar caps are white with dry ice, not frozen water in the form of
     :
    frost, wrote Dr. Robert B. Leighton and Dr. Bruce C. Murray of Cal Tech
    in Science. Their argument was based on MARINER IVâ€™S July 14, 1965,
    flyby which indicated that planetâ€™s atmosphere is very thin and largely
    composed of carbon dioxide which, in frozen form, is dry ice. Theory
    that white on Mars polar caps is ordinary frost was based on observations
    of its reflectivity in the infrared and on manner in which it affected
    orientation of light waves. Authors believed there might be frozen water
    on Mars, but suggested it is all underground in the form of permafrost.

242               ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

     Mars had never had a dense, moist, earth-like atmosphere for any ex-
     tended period and would therefore be a poor prospect for life. Dr. Opik
     argued strongly for at least a primitive form of vegetation, citing in
     particular a region of 1.2 million sq. km. that had darkened rapidly from
     1946 to 1954. He likened this to the change a distant observer would
     have seen on earth as a consequence of the virgin lands development
     program in U.S.S.R. Vegetation was the best explanation for such
     changes; however, if it were not vegetation, â€œit must be something
     specifically Martian.â€ The planet, he added, â€˜â€˜may become a source of
     great surprises in the future.â€ (Science, 7/15/66,255-65)

July 18-21: GEMINI x rendezvous and docking mission-eighth manned flight
     in Gemini series-touched on all aspects of mission objectives for which
      two-man spacecraft was designed. Mission began at ETRâ€™S Complex 14
      with launch by Atlas booster of Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (Gatv),
      followed 100 min. later by launch from Complex 19 of Titan I1 booster
      orbiting GEMINI x spacecraft with Astronauts John W. Young as com-
      mand pilot and Michael Collins as pilot. GATV x was placed in near-
      circular orbit with 187-mi. (301-km.) apogee; 180-mi. (290-km.) perigee;
      and 90.5-min. period. The 8,248-1b. GEMINI x was launched into elliptical
      orbit with initial apogee of 167 mi. (268 km.) and 99-mi. (159-km.)
      perigee.
         Maneuvers were executed as planned, with docking of GEMINI x and
      GATV x occurring at 5:58 GET. Only about 380 lbs. maneuvering fuel of
      940 lbs. at liftoff were left, whereas a 680-lb. remainder had been ex-
      pected. An out-of-plane error had necessitated a major correction, with

    from spacecraft. Eva was terminated after 28 min. to conserve maneuver-
    ing fuel; 50 lbs. had been used, as against 35 lbs. estimated consumption
    for planned 55 min.
       Third hatch opening of mission occurred when astronauts, cramped
    by unstowed equipment, jettisoned 12 items.

0 In reply to March 2 invitation byâ€˜Fcc to submit comments on whether or

    not private entities should be allowed to establish special-purpose
    communications satellite systems for domestic use, 18 organizations
    filed responses.
        Ford Foundation proposed that consideration be given to formation
    of a nonprofit nationwide television system-operating under Broad-
    casters Nonprofit Satellite Service (BNs)--which would carry an
    extensive schedule of educational programs financed by transmission
    of commercial TV programs. Foundation contended FCC had power to
    authorize such a satellite system and that the act creating ComSatCorp
    had anticipated additional systems to meet unique national needs.
        ComSatCorp filed brief saying there was no legal basis for authorizing
    private organizations to establish special-purpose communications
     satellite systems for domestic use and that it would be in the public
     interest to assign ComSatCorp a monopoly on all such systems. Opinion
     was accompanied by full technical proposal for multi-use, high-capacity,
    four-satellite system for domestic distribution of TV, voice, and data
    signals that would be operational by 1970 at estimated cost of between
    $110 and $126 million.
        AT&T argued it would be against ccexpressed national policyâ€ to
     authorize satellite systems outside the framework of commercial com-
     munications carriers and urged FCC â€œto conclude in this finding that
     there can be no authorization of private satellite systems.â€
        Carnegie Commission on Educational Television said it was encourag-
     ing a study of a comsat system that would be specifically designed for
     noncommercial television. While conceding that national satellites
     might be advantageous in some cases, Carnegie Commission warned
     that such a system presented problems of â€œeducational monopoly and
     centralized control of instructional and other material.â€ FCC was
     requested to take no definitive action until Carnegieâ€™s forthcoming
     report on educational television was published in late 1966 or early
     1967.
        Briefs of broadcasting industry cited urgency for domestic satellite
     service to cut costs of distributing television and radio programs. This
     cost reduction for the three networks-css, ABC,and NBC-was esti-
     mated at approximately $50 million a year. NBC said a determination as
      to how this satellite service should be obtained could not be made in
      the abstract but â€œwould depend o n . . . a comparison of the respective
      merits of specific proposals.â€™â€™
         National Assn. of Manufacturers told FCC that manufacturing com-
      munity should have full freedom of choice either to lease channels from
      ComSatCorp directly or establish private systems. (CR, 8/2/66,

    craft and improve knowledge of the moon. Photos would cover 3,000-
    mi. strip along moonâ€™s equator, concentrating on nine potential landing
    areas. Spacecraft would also attempt to photograph SURVEYOR I landing
    sites; provide precision trajectory information; and monitor meteoroids

August 13-14: Alternate system kept U S . tracking station at Robledo de
    Chavela, Spain, in operation when 500-600 ft. of cable were burned by

    Lunar Orbiter program, was expected to receive photos of the lunar
    surface in several days. (NASA Release 66-219)
August 14-30: NASAâ€™s   photographic spacecraft LUNAR ORBITER I became first
    US.spacecraft to enter lunar orbit-only 15 mi. off target-after 92-hr.,
    236,319-mi. flight from ETR. Orbital parameters: apolune, 1,152 mi.
    (1,854 km.) ;perilune, 119 mi. (192 km.) ;period, 3 hrs. 37 min.; inclina-
    tion, 12â€™. JPL reported drop in spacecraftâ€™s apolune Aug. 17 to 1,150 mi.
    (1,851 km.), and rise in perilune to 126 mi. (202.8 km.) ;moonâ€™s gravita-
    tional field was considered cause of orbital variations. After taking
    engineering photos transmitted to JPL Aug. 18-20, spacecraft was in-
    jected into close-in orbit by retrothrust maneuver initiated Aug. 21 for
    medium- and high-resolution photography of lurain. Tracking experts
    said 36-mi. (58-km.) perilune was â€œwithin a city blockâ€ of where it
    should be.
       Spacecraftâ€™s cameras had exposed 211 dual frames of film to photo-
    graph nine potential Apollo and Surveyor landing sites during missionâ€™s
    photo acquisition phase, announced complete on Aug. 30. Readout was
    expected to be completed by Sept. 15. Medium-resolution camera re-
    turned good images; however, except for an excellent photo of moonâ€™s
    far side, all exposures made with the high-resolution camera were dis-
    appointing. Cameraâ€™s malfunction was attributed Aug. 25 to spurious
    signal generated by spacecraftâ€™s film transfer motor at 31-mi. perilune.
    Signal was tripping high-resolution camera shutter and causing film
    smear; LUNAR ORBITER 1â€™s perilune was lowered to 23 mi. (37 km.) to
    eliminate signal. Unprogramed photograph of earth, commanded Aug.
    23 and received at NASAâ€™s tracking station at Robledo de Chavela, Spain,
    Aug. 25, showed appearance of earthâ€™s terminator-line dividing sun-
    lit and shadowed portion of planet-from distance of about 240,000 mi.
     (386,400 km.). Spacecraft also photographed SURVEYOR I landing site.

August 17-18: Senate Commerce Committeeâ€™s Subcommittee on Communi-
    cations held hearings concerning Ford Foundationâ€™s Aug. 1 proposal to
    FCC to create a nonprofit domestic satellite system which would carry
    â€œan extensive scheduleâ€ of educational television programs financed by
    transmission of commercial TV programs.
       Ford Foundation president McGeorge Bundy said that although the
    use of profits from a commercial business to finance a noncommercial
    undertaking might be novel to television, creation of a special carrier
    service in the public interest was not without precedent. He cited the
    Governmentâ€™s granting of special mailing privileges to newspapers and
   magazines. Bundy disclosed the Ford Foundation was planning to
    arrange â€œa series of meetings in various parts of the country with
   potential users of a noncommercial satellite system.â€
       Fred W. Friendly, TV consultant to Bundy, described what he said
   was the underlying irony of modern TV: commercial networks had the
   money to do qualitative public service but lacked sufficient time on the
   air, while educational TV had the time but lacked the money.
       ComSatCorp chairman James McCormack said the heart of the Ford
   proposal called for the â€œfunneling of savingsâ€ that might be enjoyed by
   commercial communications carriers into support of a cultural under-
   taking. While acknowledging the value of educational TV, McCormack
   said he felt only Congress could rule whether one segment of a diversified
   society could be compelled to support another segment without benefit
   of specific legislation to that end.
      AT&T vice president Richard Hough, ITT executive Bertram B. Tower,
   and Western Union Telegraph Go. vice president Earl D. Hilburn
   challenged the proposal saying that any such communications system
   should adhere to the common carrier principle of serving all users
   rather than any particular group such as broadcasters. While these
   witnesses supported the objective, they questioned the feasibility of the
   plan on economic and technical grounds. Tower suggested that con-
   sideration be given to permitting special rates for educational TV services
   through existing common carriers. Hilburn said that rate adjustments
   in favor of educational broadcasters might be authorized if some form
   of subsidy were determined to be in the national interest.
       Sen. John 0. Pastore (D-R.I.), who had called the hearings, said they
   were a â€œpreludeâ€ to action by FCC and noted that Congress almost
   certainly would want to explore the implications of the Ford proposal

0 Many Ufoâ€™s might be corona discharge-balls       of ionized air-originating
    along high-tension electric power lines, suggested Phillip J. Klass in
    Aviation Week. After comparing corona discharge and reported behavior
     of Ufoâ€™s, Klass found that they were similar in everything but size.
     Discrepancy in size might be from illusionary nature of light, fright of
     the observers, or lack of familiar objects for comparison. Klass empha-
    sized that his theory could not explain all such sightings, but urged
    USAF to continue investigating corona discharge theory. (Klass, Av. Wk.,

  NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., told Space
    Business Daily that NASA had presented several proposed FY 1968
    budgets to BOB, including one for â€œjust over $6 billionâ€ and another
    for $5.5 billion. He said that in the $5.5-billion budget about $500-$600
    million would be for Apollo Applications (Aa); the $6-billion budget
    would include about $1 billion for Aa. Emphasizing that major funds
    for Aa must be included in the FY 1968 budget if the billions of dollars
    spent on Apollo technology were not to be wasted, he indicated that a
    budget of about $5 billion would end plans for an adequate Aa program
    to follow Project Apollo. He noted that under a $5-billion budget,
    there would be a greater percentage cut back in contractor operations
    as opposed to inhouse NASA efforts, but that with a $5.5-billion budget
    the current ratio would remain about the same. Seamans confirmed
    that the fmt manned Apollo lunar landing could come as early as
    1968, but said it is â€œmost likelyâ€ to occur in 1969. (SBD, 8/29/66,

    advantage of strong focus is being given up.â€ Three possible major
    goals suggested by Hess were: (1) unmanned exploration of the planets,
    primarily Mars and Venus, â€œwith a subsidiary effortâ€ on Jupiter;
     (2) continued manned lunar effort; and (3) earth-orbiting astronomy

    ment satellites could continue and be richly productive.
       â€œIn a few years pictures of the earthâ€™s orb as seen from distant space
    will become commonplace. Tomorrowâ€™s schoolchildren will find it hard

    beyond.â€
       Philadelphia Evening Bulletin: â€œLooking rather like a crumbly piece
    of Roquefort, there it was-Earth, as seen from the Moon by a camera
    aboard Lunar Orbiter 1. The picture was a black-and-white, but no
    matter. Since the Moon has no appreciable atmosphere, Earth will
    never take on the bright orange and yellow hues of a harvest moon.
    And since there are no forests, no lakes, no oceans, no snowcovered
    fields on the Moon, Earth will never be framed, for lunar lovers, in the
    sylvan or aquatic settings that lend so much enchantment and mystery
    to earthly views of the Moon.â€
       Sam Shenton, leader and secretary of the International Flat Earth
    Society, claimed that the circular body shown in LUNAR ORBITER 1â€™s

     control systems, and conventional ordnance-indicated that â€œby 1975
     we will have increased by major increments the speed, range, altitude,
     payload and over-all versatility of manned aircraft for military roles.â€
     Noting that X-15 could fly faster and higher than V-2 ballistic missile,
     General McConnell said he believed â€œthat well in advance of the esti-
     mates that most people would make, Air Force pilots will be flying
     genuine aerospace craft that can take off under their own power,
     operate in space and return to a controlled landing.â€ (NATOâ€™s Fqteen

     nature, challenged two months ago by Dr. Paolo Franzini, Columbia
     Univ., and his wife Dr. Juliet Lee-Franzini, State Univ. of New York
     [see June 271, was reinforced by results of experiment conducted in
     Geneva by European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) scientists
     and reported at Rochester Conference at Univ. of California, Berkeley.
     Validation of Franzini discovery, which had stirred wide interest in
     scientific circles, would force physicists to derive new or more sophisti-
     cated explanations for basic nature of matter. CERN experiment, based
     on analysis of 10,665 photographs of eta-meson decay into three pions,
     found no significant difference in energy levels of positive and negative
     pions. Franzini had observed greater energy in positive pion than nega-
     tive. Franzini and CERN groups planned further experiments, and similar
     test would be conducted by Columbia Univ. physicist Leon Lederman.

0 â€œNobody has yet found any space goals that will stir the Europeans the
     way manned space flight and the race toward a lunar landing have
     generated tremendous technical impetus in the US. and U.S.S.R.,â€
     Robert Hotz reported in Aviation Week. â€œIf new fomulae can he found
     to fit changing European requirements, the prospects for applying the
     spearhead technology of the aerospace industry will never be brighter.
     For the United States, this will require a more realistic government
     policy in permitting more first-line technology to be exported to our
     allies. For Europe, it will require a more realistic appraisal of how its
      technical resources can be applied to compete successfully in the

September 12-15: Three-day GEMINI XI mission-ninth manned flight in
              Gemini series-began with launch of Gemini Agena Target
     NASAâ€™s
     Vehicle (GATV) by Atlas booster from ETRâ€™S Complex 14, followed 97
     min. later by launch of GEMINI XI by Titan I1 booster from Complex 19.
     Astronauts were Charles Conrad, Jr., command pilot, and Richard F.
     Gordon, Jr., pilot. GATV entered near-circular, 185-mi.-altitude orbit;
     GEMINI XI entered elliptical orbit with 175-mi. (280-km.) apogee; 100-mi.
     (161-km.) perigee; 90-min. period; and 33â€ inclination. GEMINI XI
     docked with GATV 94 min. after liftoff to become first manned spacecraft
     to achieve first-revolution rendezvous and docking-missionâ€™s primary
     objective. Other accomplishments included extravehicular activity
      (Eva), maneuvering of docked GEMINI XI-GATV configuration to record
     851-mi. altitude, station-keeping using tether to link two spacecraft,
     computer-controlled reentry, and completion of several experiments.
        After initial docking, crew executed four practice docks and spent
     sleep period attached to GATV. Gordon began planned 107-min. Eva on
     schedule at 23:58 GET, but ten minutes later, after setting up movie
     camera, retrieving micrometeoroid experiment, and attaching Agenaâ€™s
     100-ft. tether to GEMINI XIâ€™S docking bar, had to rest astride GATV.
     When blinded in his right eye by perspiration, Gordon was ordered by
     Conrad at 24:02 GET to cancel power-tool evaluation experiment and
     return to cabin.
        At 40:58 GET, following crewâ€™s second sleep period, mated spacecraft
     used GATVâ€™s primary propulsion system (pps) to attain orbit with 851-mi.
     apogee-record altitude for manned space flight. After two revolutions,
     second pps burn restored docked configuration to approximately 185-
     mi.-altitude circular orbit. At 46:58 GET Gordon opened hatch to begin
     2 hr. 8 min. standup Eva during which several photographic experiments
     were conducted. Tether dynamics exercise followed: GEMINI XI undocked
     from GATV and moved to end of 100-ft. tether which was supposed to
     hold two spacecraft on vertical line pointing earthward, proving that
      two objects could fly in formation for long duration without using
      maneuvering fuel. When vehicles began to drift, Conrad initiated slow
      rotation with appropriate spacecraft maneuvers, creating slight centri-
      fugal force which kept tether taut and spacecraft at controlled distance.
     After separation from Agena during sleep period, Conrad executed
      successful re-rendezvous-added to flight plan because of GEMINI XIâ€™S
                                               -  -

     V first stage holds 56 tank cars of propellants. The second and third
     stages of Saturn V transported by water during the Apollo program will
     spend a total of 700 days at sea. Apollo program transportation by all
     modes will require coordination with nine Government agencies. The
     launch windows for the Apollo lunar mission are relatively small,
     malfunctions on the pad must be kept to a minimum while corrective
     maintenance must be extremely fast and reliable. All of these elements
     make the Apollo logistics program both complicated and costly. . . .â€

8 U.S.S.R. astronomers had scanned the Milky Way in six-centimeter wave-

      length for first time, using Pulkovo Observatoryâ€™s huge radiotelescope
      and parabolic antenna. Observations did not confirm current theory
       that radio emanations were primarily linked with radio glow of â€œhot
      gasâ€ (ionized hydrogen) in our galaxy, but showed that â€œeven in these
      wave-lengths a considerable role is played by the emanation of fast
       electrons moving in magnetic fields at speeds close to that of light.â€
       Simultaneously, Pulkovo astronomers conducted detailed study of 80
       other clouds of ionized hydrogen to â€œhelp determine more exactly the
      physical conditions which exist in the most interesting parts of the
       Milky Way and their relationship with the continuous radio emanation
       of our galaxy as a whole.â€ (Tass, 9/14/66)

September 18: USAF Aerospace Medical Div. chief scientist Dr. Hubertus
     Strughold stated in telephone interview with Washington Sunday Starâ€™s
     William Hines that NASA had not given adequate attention to keeping
     astronautâ€™s vision unimpaired during Eva. He said that in normal earth
     gravity, man could orient himself by means of sight sense (eyes);
     balance sense (otoliths of inner ear); and pressure sense (Meissner
     corpuscles concentrated primarily in palms of hands and soles of feet).
     In space there was no gravity, so otoliths and Meissner corpuscles could
     not function. When vision was also lost or impaired, orientation was
     impossible. Strughold pointed out that vision impairment had been a
     factor in curtailment of three of four Eva missions to date. He said
     advances in training and in spacesuit design were urgently needed. USAF
     had been â€œworking on the problemâ€ but had not been asked by NASA for
     advice or assistance. (Hines, Wash. Sun. Star, 9/18/66, A7)

September 20-22: NASAâ€™s
     launched from ETRâ€™S Complex 36 at 8:32 a.m. EDT. After excellent injec-
     tion by Atlas-Centaur (AC-7) launch vehicle on trajectory toward moonâ€™s
     Sinus Medii, spacecraft successfully accomplished all required sequences
     up to midcourse maneuver. Initiated at 1:OO a.m. EDT Sept. 21, the 9.8-
     sec. thrust phase was unsuccessful because one of three vernier engines
     failed to ignite, which caused spacecraft to tumble at about 1 rps.
     Thirty-nine additional attempts were made to start all three engines.
     In all cases, the same two engines ignited; the third did not.
        JPL engineers, uncertain of cause of malfunction, speculated it might
     be result of stuck valve or insufficient power to operate engineâ€™s trigger-
     ing mechanism. They said unless it was corrected, SURVEYOR 11 could
     not softland since all three vernier engines were needed to stabilize
     spacecraft during decelerating descent to lunar surface.
        On Sept. 22, when it became apparent the mission could not be
     completed, engineering experiments were performed to obtain as much
     data as possible on spacecraft performance. All communication with
     spacecraft was lost 30 sec. after main retro ignition at 5:34 a.m. EDT.
     Probable cause was mechanical failure within telecommunications sub-
     system due to centrifugal forces generated by high tumbling rate.
     SURVEYOR 11 impacted in area of moon southeast of crater Copernicus
     about 11:18 p.m. EDT.
        Spacecraft was second in series of seven flights to prove out design,
     develop technology of lunar soft-landing, and provide basic scientific
     and engineering data in support of Project Apollo; it contained survey
     television system and instrumentation to measure lunar surface bearing
     strength, temperatures, and radar reflectivity. SURVEYOR I, identically
     equipped, was launched May 30, successfully softlanded on moon June

      D.C., that the national space program provided the best possible work-
     shop for gathering of vital science and technology necessary for other
     important goals on earth: â€œIn other words, from space research and
     development have come new methods of thinking, new techniques of
     management, new marriages of scientific disciplines, and a new illumina-
     tion on possible interrelationships of human problems to scientific

      would be a â€œvery definite missionâ€ for the 260-in.-dia. solid propellant
      motor in the U.S. space program, although that mission could not
      presently be strictly defined. He said the Nation would have to develop
      space rescue capability and one apparently promising way to do this
      was through the use of solids. Solids, he pointed out, were storable
     and could be readied and launched on short notice. (Text; MIS Daily,

     this planet: â€œOur experience in space can be a powerful stimulus to all
     of us, wherever we live, to move towards a world of law, a world without

     ligenceand, on the part of our gallant astronauts, the highest degree
     of courage and resourcefulness in the face of danger. Space activities

     research. The Chancellor expressed his satisfaction that effective steps
     toward increased cooperation in space research have been initiated
     since his last meeting with the President in December 1965. The
     President and the Chancellor welcomed the decision to expand the
     present cooperative satellite program reached as a result of the recent
     discussions in Bonn between NASA Administrator Webb and Minister
     of Science Stoltenberg.
         â€œThe President and the Chancellor agreed that scientific cooperation

         Appealing to the U.S.S.R. for early conclusion of a treaty on outer
     space exploration, Johnson said: â€œ1 earnestly hope that the Soviet
     Union-whose space achievements have been very great-will feel as
     we feel in America: that the rapid evolution of space technology makes
      . ..a treaty between us governing the use of space a most urgent matter
      . .. as we explore the vastness of space, and as we dream of new horizons,
     we work, too, for the manmade controls that will keep these efforts at
      the service of man and at the service of peace.â€ He noted that the U S .

      in which scientific and engineering questions of national importance
      could be discussed and considered. Drydenâ€™s remarkable personal gifts
      as fundamental scientist, engineer, and public administrator were
      responsible, in great measure, for this nationâ€™s preeminence in aviation

September 28: L ~ R Cawarded 7-mo. study contracts, valued at $390,000
     each, to Northrop Corp. and Fairchild-Hiller Corp. to design V/Stol
     aircraft for research on handling qualities and operation during in-
     strument approach in the terminal area. Aircraft would be used by
     NASA and USAF to gather flight research information necessary to improve
     operation of V/Stol jet aircraft in hovering and transition speed range.

0 US. invited NATO allies to use its military comsat system temporarily and

     to collaborate in joint development of new system specifically for the
     alliance. US. would make time available on its seven-satellite military
     network launched by USAF Titan I11 rocket June 17. To adapt system to
     NATOâ€™s needs, it was proposed that new ground station be built in Naples
     to operate with one under construction in the Netherlands and another
     operating in West Germany. In early 1968, satellite would be launched
     from U S . site into synchronous orbit at 22,300-mi. (35,903-km.)
     altitude for allianceâ€™s exclusive use. It could be built by consortium
     of member countries. Eventually, comsat system was envisaged whose
     relays would permit use of ground stations small enough to be carried
     on a truck which could be used by military units on the move. Cost of
     plan was said to be some $50 million. Proposal would be on agenda of
     next meeting of NATOâ€™s foreign ministers, set tentatively for Dec. 15-16.

    Ocean and Western Europe-had been matched so operations of satellite
    systems could be compared. Joint effort to improve transmission quality
    had been proposed since transmission seemed to degrade photographs :
    U.S. scientists found Soviet photos â€œpoorâ€ in quality; Soviet scientists
    described U.S. photos as â€œusable.â€

* Press briefing was held at LaRc on results of NASAâ€™sLUNAR ORBITER I
     mission, launched Aug. 10 from ETR to orbit the moon and photograph
     possible landing sites for Apollo astronauts.
        The more than 200 photos transmitted by the spacecraft revealed
     a rugged lunar landscape covered with thousands of craters. Ridges and
     hills were more gently sloped near moonâ€™s center and became progres-
     sively smoother in the west. Presence of large rocks, or â€œblocks,â€
     proved that surface was firm enough to support manned spacecraft. Of
     the nine sites photographed, the Ocean of Storms where SURVEYOR I was
     resting appeared safest for manned landing. Classified as a dark mare-
     flat, waterless plain with relatively few craters-it had 20 per cent fewer
     craters than any of the other sites.
        U.S. Geological Survey scientists Dr. Harold Masursky and Dr.
     Lawrence Rowan suggested that the photos showed evidence of volcanic
     activity. Citing a small cone-shaped hill on line of a geologic rift near
     SURVEYOR I and a large crater on the back of the moon, apparently filled
     with congealed lava, Dr. Masursky said: â€œThe moon is not a cold, dead,
     lifeless planet. It looks close to being as dynamic as the earth.â€ Dr.
     Rowan noted that major faults on the lunar surface seemed to run in
     two general directions-northeast-southwest and southeast-northwest
     -and concluded that much of the volcanic activity probably occurred
     along these lines.
        LaRC scientist William Michael said nonphotographic data on the
     satelliteâ€™s orbit indicated moon might turn flat side toward earth, not
     bulgy side as generally believed. He said displacement of moonâ€™s center
     of mass toward earth could explain both a flat face and moonâ€™s slight
     wobble, which had been accounted for previously by the â€˜â€˜bulgeâ€ theory.
        Micrometeoroid detection experiment had not recorded any â€œhitsâ€
     during satelliteâ€™s eight weeks in lunar orbit in contrast to earth-orbiting
      satellites which often registered a hit every two weeks.
        Project Manager Clifford H. Nelson announced that Lunar Orbiter
      E-second of five satellites in series-would be launched between Nov.
      6 and 1 to photograph area slightly north of that scanned by LUNAR

October 10: Johnson Administration could not increase NASAâ€™s FY 1968budget
    because of Vietnam war, but it could make a policy decision on a post-
    Apollo program, wrote Robert Hotz, in Aviation Week.
        â€œWhat it will take to get this effort going is some political courage to
    restate the necessity of proceeding beyond Apollo, a decision to chart a
    specific course from the available alternatives and some modest Fiscal
    1968 funding to retain the technical resources that will be required for
    the future-particularly engineering and scientific manpower. This
    combination of activity has already been deferred one year beyond its
    critical moment by the Johnson Administration. Delay for another fiscal
    year could impose a braking effect from which eventual acceleration
    would be much more costly and much less effective.â€ (Hotz, Av. Wk.,

     phenomenon with a shrug. He said that when he was scientific consultant
     to USAFâ€™s Project Blue Book-Ufo registry at Wright-Patterson AFB-
     some of the most coherent reports had come from scientifically trained
     people. â€œHard dataâ€ cases had contained frequent allusions to recurrent
     kinematic, geometric, and luminescent characteristics. â€œI have begun
     to feel that there is a tendency in 20th century science to forget that
     there will be a 21st century science, and indeed a 30th century science,
     from which vantage points our knowledge of the universe may appear
     quite different.â€ He had urged USAF â€œto ask physical and social scientists
     of stature to make a . . . scholarly studyâ€™â€™ of Ufoâ€™s. Hynekâ€˜s letter was

* Radar signature analysis (Rsa) for â€œspatial detective workâ€ was discussed
     in Time. Using Rsa, scientists could reconstruct characteristics of
     foreign satellite from radar pulse pattern reflected to tracking station:
     by measuring amplitude of reflected pulses, satelliteâ€™s size could be
     calculated; by analyzing variations in pulse amplitude, satelliteâ€™s shape
     could be determined; by determining periodicity with which pulse
     pattern repeated itself, speed of tumbling, rolling, or spinning around
     spacecraftâ€™s axes could be inferred. Computerized Rsa was being devel-
     oped so that in event of war, warhead radar signatures could be spotted
     quickly enough to order interception and destruction by defending

     ing address noted meeting represented â€œa time for self appraisal.          We
    at Cal Tech are seriously seeking to take a hard look at ourselves, at the
     world of science and technology of which we are part, and at the world
     of human beings who may either benefit or possibly suffer from what
     we do.â€
        NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E.
     Mueller said that â€œthrough the creative use of the capabilities that we
     are building up, space may . . . be used as one of many approaches to
    alleviateâ€ problems of â€œfamine, disease, over-population, and the need
    for more and better educationâ€ facing developing nations.
        Dreams of eventual space travel were â€œpure fantasy,â€ according to
     Cal Tech astronautics professor Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein. He urged,
     however, that a greater portion of national expenditures be devoted to
     achieving interstellar communications-a task that â€˜â€˜may ultimately
     become the greatest scientific adventure.â€
        Dr. Robert P. Sharp, professor of geology at Cal Tech, noted that
    although â€œearth scientistsâ€ were playing important role in national
    space program, it was also important that they â€œlook downward into
                            .
     our own planet. . . Our understanding of these distant bodies will
     depend to a good degree upon how well we understand our own plain
     earth.â€
        Likelihood that revolutionary improvement in communication on
     earth would transform society was suggested by John R. Pierce, research
     director of Bell Telephone Labs. Communications Sciences Div. Satel-
     lites would greatly expand potential of backward countries and would
     help build a sense of national identity in underdeveloped areas.

     â€œeffectively link scientific developments with social betterment.â€
        Dr. Murray Gell-Mann, professor of theoretical physics at Cal Tech,
     said society must give new direction to technology, diverting it from
     applications that yield higher productive efficiency into areas that
     yielded greater human satisfaction. A symbol of this sort of change
     would occur when man no longer wanted to channel resources into
     â€œbuilding bigger, noisier aircraftâ€ or when society decided to divert a
     new highway around a virgin forest rather than build through it.

    â€œfield exerciseâ€ in Ariiona, Nevada, and California, to test methods of
    identifying underground nuclear explosions. Project, which would
    begin in late 1966 and continue through May 1967, would develop
    methods by which international inspection teams might police a ban on
    underground nuclear tests. (UPI, Wash. Post, 11/4/66, A23)
November 4: U.S.S.R. had launched Yantar I ionospheric laboratory equipped
    with gas plasma ion engine to altitudes of 100 to 400 km. (62 to 249 mi.)

    results published in magazines of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
        Both NASA and USAF had already conducted several ground and flight
    tests of electric engines, and another series was scheduled to begin in
    late 1966. Jerome P. Mullin, of OARTâ€™S Nuclear Systems and Space
    Power Div., told the New York Times in a telephone interview that
    electric engines had â€œdemonstrated their practical utilityâ€ for maneu-
    vering and stabilizing spacecraft in flight. (Tass, 11/4/66; Grose, NYT,

    and two antennas and locked its five solar sensors on the sun. Only
    difficulty occurred when spacecraftâ€™s star-tracker lost its fix on Canopus,
    delaying critical midcourse maneuver eight hours. Correction was
    accomplished at 44:09 GET and JPL predicted spacecraft would come
    very close to original aiming point.
       Primary objectives of NASAâ€™s      LUNAR ORBITER II mission, second in
    series of five, were (1) to place three-axis stabilized spacecraft into lunar
    orbit; and (2) to obtain high-resolution photos on various lunar surface
    areas to assess their suitability as landing sites for Apollo and Surveyor
    spacecraft, and to improve our knowledge of the moon. Photos would
    cover 13 primary target sites, located generally within northern half
    of the Apollo zone of interest on the moonâ€™s front face. I t would also

November 27: Two propulsion developments emerging from engineering
    research might open Jupiter, the regions outside the solar system, and
    even the sun to closeup inspection during 1970s, said Dr. Homer Joe
    Stewart, manager of JPLâ€™S Advanced Studies Office. Developments were
    use of planetary gravitational drag and solar-electric propulsion. When
    a spacecraft neared a planet, it would gain speed from gravitational pull.
    While traveling under planetâ€™s gravitation attraction, it would pick up
    planetâ€™s own sun-orbit speed. This, added to spacecraftâ€™s momentum,
    would be enough to propel spacecraft past planetâ€™s gravitational field
    and toward another planet. Travel between gravitational fields would
    be powered by spacecraftâ€™s solar-electric system. Solar-electric propul-
    sion would double useful payload for a Mars-orbiter mission, Dr.
    Stewart said, and it would offer the advantage of high specific impulse
    â‚¬or a Jupiter flyby. (JPL Release; A&A, 12/66, 26-31)
0 Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (USAF, Ret.) said on ABC-TVâ€™S â€œIssues and

    question with respect to the effectivenessâ€ of an antimissile system
    aimed at stopping the sophisticated weapons the U.S.S.R. probably had.
     On the other hand, the US. could build a defense against the type of
    missile the Communist Chinese were presently capable of launching.
    Schriever said he believed US. missiles would get through the anti-
    missile system reportedly being deployed in U.S.S.R. (AP, NYT,

  U.S.S.R. was showing increasing signs of having conceded manned lunar
    landing race to U S . as part of vastly revamped space program, Donald
    C. Winston postulated in Aviation Week. Significance of new program
    was that it reflected emphasis Premier Alexey Kosygin had fomented in
    Soviet planning. Brezhnev and Kosygin, who came to power while three-
    man VOSKHOD I was still in orbit in October 1964, ordered the space-
     craft to earth prematurely as one of their first moves even before the
    overthrow of Nikita Khrushchev was made public. It was not long before
    Kosygin grounded the rest of the Voskhod series, which was to have
     continued with at least five launches through 1965. Only VOSKHOD II
    was permitted off the ground after Kosygin took power. The March 1965
    mission was conducted because planning had reached an advanced
     stage by the time Khrushchev was ousted and because Cosmonaut A.A.
    Leonovâ€™s Eva-first in history-had high propaganda value. Winston
     theorized that the new space philosophy could produce a much less
     complex manned circumlunar mission without landing within the next
     year. (Av. Wk., 11/28/66, 22)

November 29-December 2: AIAAâ€™s Third Annual Meeting and Technical Dis-
    play was held in Boston. In keynote address, NASC Executive Secretary
    Dr. Edward C. Welsh described the manned spaceflight program as the
     most successful technological feat ever undertaken by the Nation.
     Panel discussion followed on future of US. space program.
        Dr. Gordon J. F. MacDonald, Institute for Defense Analyses, pre-
     dicted that man would be needed in space primarily as a ccrepairmanyâ€™
     for scientific instruments. â€œThe science . . . will be carried out on the
     ground where enormous facilities for computing, analysis, and discus-
     sion are a ~ a i l a b l e . ~ ~
        Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (USAF, Ret.) said emphasis on space
     activities should not be only on peaceful purposes but also on preserva-
     tion of peace; this would inevitably require sending military men into
     space. With advances in technology, US. must convert from â€œthrow-
     awayâ€ hardware concept to use of maneuverable reentry vehicles and
     recoverable boosters, he added.
        This idea was echoed by NASA Associate Administrator for Manned
     Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller, who said: â€œ. . . all of the hardware
     developed for futiwe projects would reflect our concern over . . .greater
     cost effectiveness, through the development of reusable launch vehicles
     and reusable spacecraft.â€ Mueller said there would be manned space
     stations that could stay in orbit a year or longer but said there was no
     need for crews to stay aloft for such periods. A ferry vehicle would be
     used for resupply of both equipment and crew. He listed potential
     benefits of space technology in the next decade, describing air traffic
     control towers in space, direct-to-home international TV broadcasting
     systems, and possibilities for predicting and controlling the weather.
        Rep. George P, Miller (D-Calif.) said one of the problems of the
     House Committee on Science and Astronautics-of which he was chair-
358                ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1966

      man-was educating the people of the Nation to the benefits of the
      space program. It was a di5cult task, he said, to â€˜ustify space expendi-
      tures against the costs of Vietnam, foreign ai(i, and Great Society
      projects. But, he insisted, â€˜â€˜it is the translation of space technologies
      into useful benefits that is the overall value of the space program.â€

         Results from NASAâ€™s    EXPLOBEB XXXIII had shown for first time that
      tail of earthâ€™s magnetosphere â€œextends more than 75,000 miles beyond
      the orbit of the moon,â€ reported GSFC scientist Dr. Norman F. Ness.
      Findings were contrary to those of Soviet scientist Dolginov and col-
      leagues who had reported they were unable to detect magnetospheric
      tail at lunar distances on basis of data obtained from LUNA x between
      April 3 and May 4, 1966. Ness suggested as reason for this that LUNA x
      data were probably obtained when spacecraft was near or within neutral
      sheet region of magnetosphere where very low magnetic fields would be
      expected. (GSFC Release 20-66)
         In session on Future Large Subsonic Transports, John Borger of PAA
      said problems in air transport industry â€œare being created by the phe-
      nomenal growth rate of our business.â€ Since the growth rate showed
      no signs of slackening in the coming years, continued development and
      extensive use of large subsonic jet aircraft were not only desirable but
      essential. Borger pointed out that the engine for the Boeing 747-
      which would carry 2% times more passengers than present inter-
      continental transports-was      being developed with only commercial
      airlines as potential customers. This was the first time in air history
      that a new aircraft powerplant had been undertaken on this basis.
      Borger noted that a major requirement for the â€œjumbo jetsâ€ was that
      they be available at least 5 to 6 yrs. ahead of the proposed Sst so that
      initial development and operation costs could be recovered.
         H. F. Klnmp, general manager of cargo traffic and sales for Deutsche
      Lufthansa Airlines, sounded a warning about the subsonic jet aircraftâ€™s
      cargo capacity: unless airports expanded their freight handling facilities
      enormously, they would not be able to handle volume of material
      â€œdumped on them.â€
         W. D. Perreault, program director â‚¬or Lockheed 500-a giant com-
      mercial cargo aircraft for the 1970s-discussed evolution of the 500
      from C-5A transport under development for USAF. After reviewing three
      proposed commercial versions of the aircraft, he said one of them â€œwill
      provide for the first time a cargo plane with direct operating costs of
      less than 2# er ton statute mile.â€ (AIAA Daily, 11/30/66, 1,31; Hines,
      Wash. Eve. &ar, 11/29/66, A10)
         Commenting on the report of the AIAA Launch Vehicle and Missile
      Technical Committee, â€œThe Next Generation of Launch Vehicles-
      Evolution or Bold Step?â€ N. E. Golovin of the Office of Science and
      Technology said: â€œ. . . if a family of reusable boosters is to be developed
      â‚¬or reasons of economy then development cost per booster must he so
      low that economical amortization must be possible over a relatively
      small number of flights for each type; or, if only a single reusable
      booster is to be developed its use must indeed be so cheap that it would
      pay to employ it for payloads which are but a small fraction of its orbit-
                                    .
      ing capacity. This reasoning . . casts considerable doubt on the Com-
      mitteeâ€™s suggestion that a â€˜bold stepâ€™ leading to the development of
      reusable boosters is justified at this time.â€ (Text)

tions Dr. Edgar M. Cortright, participating in a panel discussion on
â€œDO We Need New Propulsion Systems for Lunar and Planetary
Flight?â€, concluded that unmanned missions during the next ten years
would probably â€œnot require either new propulsion systems or new
launch vehicle stages. They probably will require adding a modified
Centaur as an upper stage on the Saturn IB or the Titan IIIC. They may
require and certainly could use a 260 inch solid first stage under the
                  . . .â€
S-IV-B Centaur.            Cortright recommended that current launch
capability be put â€œto effective use in exploring space and in developing
practical applications of space flight.â€ (Text)
    During panel on -Space and Public Policy, â€œpoor communicationsâ€
between scientists and the general public was suggested reason for
death of Project Mohole-killed by Congress because it would have
cost at least three times the original estimate. NAS president Frederick
Seitz said such escalations in cost were â€œnot unusualâ€ for such scien-
tific ventures and revealed the project would soon be renewed under a
different name such as â€œdeep ocean drilling.â€
    â€œThe goals of space exploration are primarily those of science, not
 technology,â€ asserted panelist Hunter Dupree, science historian and
 history professor at Univ. of California, Berkeley. Chairman of the
 Presidentâ€™s Science Advisory Committeeâ€™s Panel on Space Science
 Louis Branscomb replied that no one wanted to see the space program
 purely as a â€œspectator sport,â€ and that space programs should be con-
 ceived to â€œmaximize their scientific returns.â€ Commenting on the same
 subject, NASA Deputy Administrator Robert C. Seamans, Jr., said: â€œWe
 must grapple with the problem of what we will do with the moon. This
 is not an esoteric problem.â€ Concerned about the lack of AIAA advice to
 Congress on questions of scientific policy, Rep. Emilio Q. Daddario
  (D-Conn.), member of House Committee on Science and Astronautics,
  said the loudest critics of the space program were scientists in other
  disciplines eying the space money. â€œI call on AIAA to come to Congress
 with a sharpened viewpoint. You can speak with the consensus of
  35,000 members.â€
     Avco Corp. vice president Arthur Kantrowitz feared that â€œAIAA is
  not equippedâ€ to do the suggested job because unanimity within the
  society could not be achieved on policy questions. And unless it could,
  the assignment râ€˜would induce strains within AIAA and change its com-
  plexion.â€ (AIAA Daily, 12/2/66, 1, 29)

    L. Bisplinghoff in Astronautics & Aeronautics. ccUnlessthe space program
    serves people in a useful way, it will be transitory and fade into history
    as a curiosity. It will not even be enough for the program to serve people
    by measuring interesting scientific data. It must eventually serve the
    masses of people of the Earth, if it is to command substantial resources.â€

    satellites. Recommendations included: (1) redesign of outmoded elec-
    tronic equipment that had performed poorly in space; (2) rigorous pre-
    flight testing with prototype models under simulated space conditions;
     (3) stronger management of observatory program within NASA; and (4)
    increased surveillance of performance at contractorsâ€™ plants. Report
    was compiled by five-man board appointed April 21 by NASA Associate
    Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newel1
    and chaired by his Deputy for Engineering Robert F. Garbarini. It
    studied OAO I mission, which failed two days after April 8 launch because

       Because technological advance is largely indivisible, a nation either
     opts for technology or it doesnâ€™t. As some sister nations have learned,
    you either move with the tide of technological advance or you fall
                             ..
    behind on all fronts. .
         Today the question becomes the same for us. It is not should we as

     a nation have space or other things, but rather can we have the â€˜other

      Agena D booster into elliptical transfer orbit with 22,831-mi. (36,758-
      km.) apogee; 114-mi. (183-km.) perigee; 650-min. period; and 31â€
    inclination. At 16:30 GET, apogee motor was fired to place satellite into
    near-synchronous 22,300-mi.-altitude orbit. I t would be allowed to
    drift 12 days to stationary position over the Pacific at 151â€ west longi-
    tude.
        One of the most versatile satellites ever developed, 775-1b. ATS I
    carried 15 communications, technology, and scientific experiments,
    including camera systems for cloud-cover photos; two-way VHF trans-
    ponder for voice communications between ground stations and aircraft
    in flight; electronically despun antenna to continuously direct a radio
    beam toward earth; and low-thrust resistojet which produced thrust of
    450 millionths of a pound. Capable of multiple-access communications,
    satellite would be able to transmit TV and voice communications among
    stations in North America, Asia, and Australia. It would also be used to
    send weather data from ESSA facility at Suitland, Md., to Automatic
    Picture Transmission (Apt) stations in US., Japan, and Australia.
    Mission objectives were to inject spacecraft into synchronous orbit and
    place it on station; operate spacecraft for at least 30 days; and conduct
    experiments. Ats program-a five-satellite project managed by GSFC
    under OSSA direction-sought to investigate technology common to

December 7: US. confusion and concern over U.S.S.R.â€™s space objectives
    had increased because of the â€œlong gapâ€ in Soviet manned space flights
    and three recent Soviet launches â€œsurrounded by unusual secrecy,â€
    Evert Clark reported in the New York Times. Two of the spacecraft,
    secretly launched Sept. 17 and Nov. 2, had exploded in orbit; the third,
    Nov. 28, had been announced as COSMOS CXXXIII but orbital inclination
    usually given in Cosmos launch reports was not disclosed. Clark warned
    that U S . experts might be â€œunderestimating the Soviet Unionâ€™s com-
    mitment to space explorationâ€ and suggested U.S.S.R. was either: (1)
    preparing to secretly launch manned spacecraft with three- to six-man
    crew in early 1967; (2) conducting tests to precede new missions to
    Mars and Venus; (3) changing its emphasis from manned lunar ex-
    ploration to manned earth-orbiting stations; or (4) trying to provide
    maximum coverage of US. by launching additional reconnaissance
     satellites. (Clark, NYT, 12/8/66, 1)

     â€œthe most important arms control development since the Limited Test
     Ban Treaty of 1963,â€ the President said he would seek fast Senate
     approval so US. would be first nation to ratify it. Primary provisions:
    (1) moon and other celestial bodies should be free for exploration, use,
    and scientific research to all countries and international organizations
    exclusively for peaceful purposes; (2) no country should be ermitted
                                                                     up
    a claim of sovereignty or appropriation; (3) no country sho d be per-
    mitted to place weapons of mass destruction, establish military bases,
    or conduct military activities on moon and celestial bodies; (4) all
    outer space activities would be subject to international law and should
    be reported to U.N. Secretary General; (5) cooperative efforts should
    be made to avoid harmful contamination, conduct scientific research,
    and assist all astronauts in need of aid; and (6) all stations, installations,
    and space vehicles on moon and other celestial bodies should be open
    to other countries on reciprocity basis. Use of ICBMâ€™s, reconnaissance
    satellites, and USAFâ€™S Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol) were not
    affected.

    with the idea of the multiple executive. . . We saw this kind of need
    at the very beginning of NASAâ€™s    history. We evolved, therefore, a part-
    nership arrangement which included Dr. Hugh Dryden, Dr. Robert
     Seamans, and myself. We all had many common ideas, and yet each
    brought to our work on the critical decisions affecting the nationâ€™s space
     effort certain specialized experience. To do it any other way would have
     deprived us of the kind of mutual support and broadly-based leadership
     that I think we achieved.â€ (Text)

     needs to get done in order to insure that the lunar operation is proper.â€
     He outlined the flights: (1) AS-20&three-man, earth-orbital mission
     of up to 14 days to check out crew, spacecraft, and ground equipment;
                               to 12-day flight in which Uprated Saturn I

    we didnâ€™t know what to train for. So we did everything. . Training for
    Apollo has been pretty straight forward. We know what we need to
    know and we know that we have to learn about the spacecraft, how to
    operate it and get our flight plan and our mission rules squared away.
    Back early in Mercury.. . we were worried about whether a man
                            ..
    could live and survive . so we did a lot of things like spinning around
    in 3 axis machines that we donâ€™t feel you really need anymore. . . .â€

December 24-31: U.S.S.R. achieved her second soft-landing on the moon
     when LUNA XIII spacecraft landed an instrument package near Ocean of
     Storms to photograph and test the lunar surface.
        Landing sequence began when spacecraft was oriented vertically to
     the moon. At 43-mi. (69-km.) altitude, radar system aimed at lunar
     surface and turned on retrorocket, and shock-absorbing system was
     prepared. Less than one second before impact, after spacecraft had been
     slowed to 18 mph, instrument capsule was ejected and softlanded.
     Four minutes later, its petal-like covering opened, its antenna opened,
     and radio transmissions began.
                                                                         381

       18 hrs. after touchdown, LUNA XIII began photographing a panorama
    of the moonâ€™s surface. Pictures showed barren, heavily pitted land-
    scape littered with stones ranging upward in size from one inch, which
    Soviet scientists concluded had resulted from either volcanic eruptions
    or impacting meteoroids. There was no evidence of a thick layer of
    dust.
       In addition to photographic equipment, spacecraft also carried two
    mechanical manipulators to test firmness and density of lunar soil:
    (1) a rod which was driven into surface with specific force; and (2) a
    meter which measured soilâ€™s resistance to radiation. Analysis of data
    indicated that lunar surface could bear manned spacecraft and that
    soil from 8- to 12-in. depth was similar to medium-density terrestrial
    soil. Also onboard were a dynograph which tested firmness of lunar
    surface by recording duration and force of impact impulse, and a
    radiation meter which revealed that moonâ€™s surface reflected about
    25 per cent of electrically-charged particles which struck it.
       Tass commented on LUNA XIIIâ€™S successful mission: â€œThere is no doubt
    now that it is these cosmic stations that can supply the information

         Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, U.S. Geological Survey, said NASAâ€™s LUNAR
      ORBITER I photos had revealed â€œmass wastingâ€ on the moon-a         proc-
      ess similar to â€œdownhill creepâ€ which produced slopes of fragmented
     dirt and rock debris on earth. Accelerated by small local earthquakes
      caused by impacting meteorites, wasting process was rapidly covering
      all of moonâ€™s small craters, Shoemaker said. He believed majority of
      lunar craters were caused by high-velocity explosive impacts of me-
      teorites.

    One, in 110 min. of power operation, demonstrated stability and con-
    trollability of the hot-bleed cycle nuclear rocket engine. The other
    involved first successful full-power operation and a restart operation,
    ending the program with an accumulation of more than 105 min. of
    reactor operation at full or near-full power.
       USAF flight tested its powerful Titan 111 booster and used it to orbit
    the first seven Idcsp satellites of an eventual worldwide military comsat
    system.
        Of the 43 Soviet payloads, 34 were Cosmos satellites and five, Luna
    spacecraft. Notable among these were COSMOS CX, orbiting two dogs
    for prolonged period; COSMOS CXXII, apparently first Soviet weather satel-
    lite; LUNA IX, achieving first soft-landing on the moon; and LUNA X,
    achieving first orbit of the moon. Also orbited were two MOLNIYA 1 com-
    sats and the 12-ton PROTON 111 unmanned spacecraft used for cosmic-ray
    research; Yantar I ion-engine payload was flown in suborbital space-
    flight test.
       France orbited her first instrumented scientific satellite, DIAPASON I,
    the second satellite built and launched by France. (NASA Release 66-319;

During 1966: International space events were highlighted by the U.N.â€™s
    agreement on a space treaty to govern â€œactivities of states in the explora-

      tion and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial
      bodies.â€ The draft treaty-suggested by President Johnson May 7-was
      negotiatedby the LegalSubcommitteeof theU.N. CommitteeonthePeace-
      ful Uses of Outer Space. On December 19 the U.N. General Assembly
      adopted a resolution endorsing the treaty, subject to ratification by five
      nations including US., U.S.S.R., and U.K.
         By the end of 1966, 72 countries had cooperated with the US. in
      space research activities.
         Six countries joined the International Telecommunications Satellite
      Consortium (Intelsat), bringing the total membership to 54.
         France and U.S.S.R. entered into agreement on cooperative space
      research, including experiments in astronomy and communications.

               SPACE FLIGHTS
                    A CHRONICLE FOR 1966
   The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Dr. Frank
W. Anderson, Jr., Deputy NASA Historian. Sources included the United
Nations Public Registry; the Satellite Situation Report issued by the Space
Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center; public informa-
tion releases of the Department of Defense, NASA, and other agencies; and
the Report to the Congressfrom the President of the United States: United States
Aeronautics and Space Activities, 1966. Russian data are from the U.N. Public
Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, translations from Tass News Agency,
statements in the Soviet press, and international news servicesâ€™ reports.
    It might be well to call attention to the terms of reference stated or implied
in the title of this tabulation. This is a listing of payloads that have (a)
orbited, (b) as probes, ascended to at least the 4,000-mile altitude that tradi-
tionally has distinguished probes from sounding rockets, etc., or (c) conveyed
one or more human beings in space. Furthermore, only flights that succeeded
-or at least are not known to have failed-in doing one of the above are
listed. Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. An
asterisk by the date marks those dates that are one day earlier in this tabula-
tion than in listings which reference to Greenwich time.
    This was the year in which world space activity leveled out. After a decade
of virtual doubling of activity each year, 1966 showed only a slight rise in
total launches-116 against 102 in 1965-and a decline in the total number
of payloads orbited-143 against the record 160 in 1965. At first glance there
seems to be an inconsistency in a rise in number of launches and a drop in
number of payloads; the answer is found in the abrupt switch away from
multiple payloads that was one of the notable changes of direction in 1966
 (DOD still flew16 multipayload flights totaling 42 individual payloads, including
the 8-satellite Titan IIIC, but the Soviets launched none, compared with 7
flights for a total of 23 payloads in 1965, and NASA none, compared with 3
flights for a total of 6 payloads in 1965). Of the 1966 total, the U.S. launched
92 boosters carrying 100 payloads (compared with 61/94 in 1965), the
U.S.S.R. launched 43 (compared with 50 launches for a total of 66 payloads
in 1965), and France joined the space club with one satellite in 1966. Of the
U.S. total, DOD accounted for 70 payloads and 42 launches (compared with
67/39 in 1965), NASA 30 (compared with 27 payloads in 22 launches in 1965;
 one of the 30 was a Don-NASA mission, INTELSAT II-A, launched by NASA for
ComSatCorp). Two areas of concentration were again significant: the U.S.
 continued to dominate manned space flight, with 5 Gemini manned flights
 during the year, while the Soviets had no manned flights (compared with
 511 in 1965);the Soviets continued their numerical edge in lunar exploration
 with 5 lunar flights to 4 for the U.S. (compared with 5/2 in 1965).
    As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of these
 appendixes is never complete because of the inescapable lag behind each
 flight of the analysis and interpretation of scientific results.

 CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHINGS
JANUARY 1, 1966, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 1966
   This chronology of major NASA launchings in 1966 is intended to provide
an accurate and ready historical reference, one compiling and verifying
information previously scattered over several sources. It includes launchings
of all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by NASA
or under â€œNASA directionâ€ (e.g., NASA provided vehicle, launch facilities,
and performed the launch for the ComSatCorp INTELSAT 11-A).
   An attempt has been made to classify the performance of both the launch
vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of primary
mission. Three categories have been used for vehicle performance and
mission results-successful (S), partially successful (P) , and unsuccessful
 (U). A fourth category, unknown (Unk), has been provided for payloads
where vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to exercise its
main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary, since many of
the results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they ignore the fact that a
great deal was learned from shots that may have been classified as unsuccess-
ful.
   Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. Sources used
were all open ones, verified where in doubt from the project offices in NASA
Hq. and from the NASA Centers. For further information on each item, see
Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chronology as refer-
enced in the index. Prepared January 1967 by Dr. Frank W. Anderson, Jr.,
Deputy NASA Historian (EH).

CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPACE FLIGHT, 1966
   This chronology contains basic information on all manned space flights
in 1966. The information was compiled by William D. Putnam, Assistant
NASA Historian for Manned Space Flight.
   The year 1966 was marked by the last five missions of the United States'
Gemini program and continuation of the hiatus in Soviet manned space
flights (since VOSKHOD 11 in March 1965). Major historic milestones in
manned space flight were rendezvous and docking with another space vehicle
on GEMINI VIII, the use of a propulsion unit placed separately into orbit to
propel the assembled combined spacecraft to new altitude and speed records
on GEMINI x and XI, and extensive astronaut extravehicular activity on
GEMINI x, XI, XI. Numerous technological and scientific experiments con-
ducted in Gemini made significant contributions to man's knowledge of the
space environment, the earth as observed from the vantage point of space,
and astronomical phenomena.
   By the end of 1966, the United States had conducted a total of 16 manned
space flights, 14 of these orbital, with a total of 19 different crewmen. Seven
of the 19 American astronauts had participated in two flights. The Soviet
Union had conducted a total of eight manned flights, all orbital, with 11
different crewmen. No Soviet cosmonaut had yet experienced two space
flights. Cumulative totals for manned spacecraft hours in flight had reached
1,023 hours 45 minutes for the United States and 432 hours 33 minutes for
the Soviet Union. Cumulative total manhours in space were 1,993 hours
36 minutes, and 507 hours 9 minutes, respectively.
   Data on United States flights are the latest available to date within NASA.
Although details are subject to modification as information is refined, the
major aspects of United States manned flihts have been subject to direct
 observation by the interested citizens of the world.
    Weight given is the weight of the total spacecraft as placed in orbit.
Maximum altitude is chosen from many possible performance measurements
because it represents a world-record category as recognized by the FBdQation
AQonautique Internationale.
