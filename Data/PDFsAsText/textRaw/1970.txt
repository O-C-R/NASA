                            Foreword
    This volume provides an immediate reference to aerospace-related
events of 1970, enabling all of us to broaden or to refresh our crowded
memories. As part of NASA%chronology series it is intended to help his-
torians and other analysts in preserving historical accuracy and preci-
sian.
    Perhaps the Apollo 13problems that resulted in using the lunar lander
Aquarius as a â€œlifeboatâ€ will be the most readily recalled of the 1970
events. Yet, as this volume clearly indicates, there were many signifi-
cant milestones in space and aeronautics. The lunar samples returned by
Apollo I 2 and 12 were intensively studied in the United States and 16
other countries; the last two Apollo missions scheduled were canceled;
the feasibility of reusable space shuttles as a means of reducing the cost
and expanding the versatility of space operations was examined in
greater detail; the Skylab program to evaluate manâ€™s adaptation to the
space environment proceeded toward its launchings in early 1973. Divi-
dends continued to be returned from our scientific satellites already in
orbit: Pioneer VIcompleted six orbits of the sun, providing data on solar
weather on the far side of the sun; Oao IIbegan transmitting ultraviolet
spectral data on some 25 000 stars; Ogo III, IV, V, and VImade sky sur-
veys which could correlate geophysical data from other satellites,
sounding rockets, and ground-based instruments. Among the 38 new
payloads launched by the United States were the first prototype satellite
for an operational weather system, ITOS, and three Intelsat communica-
tions satellites. Japan and China both launched their first satellites dur-
ing 1970. In aeronautics, research and development on the supercritical
wing culminated in the first flight tests. And the X-24 â€œlifting bodyâ€
made its first flight early in the year and moved into supersonic flight in
October.
    Other kinds of events are also included in this chronology. Dr. Cyril
 A. Ponnamperuma of the Ames Research Center reported the first posi-
tive identification of amino acids of extraterrestrial origins, found in the
meteorite that fell near Murchison, Australia, in 1969. Numerous entries
evidence increasing international cooperation in and mutual benefits
from space activities.
    The overall space program was being evaluated during all of 1970-at
 perhaps the very peak of our technological and scientific achievements
 in exploration, in basic science, and in application to earth-bound needs.
 Questions of the basicevalueof and the need for space activities in rela-
 tion to needs for solutions of problems on earth were being explored in
 all sectors of our national life. The space frontier has been crossed and
 men, their thoughts and their machines, are no longer bound to our
 home planet Earth. The accessibility of space will have a place in manâ€™s
 life and thinking for all his future. Even against a backdrop of the broad
 range of earth-bound problems-poverty, pollution, world peace, and
                                      iii
disruptive changes besetting most social institutions-manâ€™s new
perspective on his place in a dynamic universe is a basic challenge. We
appear to have been in an escalating scientific and technological revolu-
tion during the 20th century, its intellectual stimulus and constructive
values perhaps best symbolized by the intense space venture of the past
decade.
   The space program as a human enterprise, gaining new knowledge and
skills and applying them to practical purpose, seems a symbol much
needed in a world beset by doubts and fears and frustrations and with
many difficult problems yet to solve.

   As with its seven annual ancestors and several precursors, this vol-
ume is intended to be as complete and accurate a chronicle of known
events and commentary in 1970 as could be documented by immediately
available sources. Essential1 it provides a running start on aeronauti-
                             Y
cal and astronautical data o interest to future historians. But it also
serves as a general reference for those interested in science, technology,
and policy aspects of aerospace affairs during 1970.
   For the first time, this Astronautics and Aeronautics chronology gives
all measurements in the metric system according to the International
                                          a
System of Units (SI). Heretofore, the En iish system of units was used.
In this volume they are retained in parent eses following SI units. NASA
Policy Directive 2220.4 of September 14, 1970, required conversion to
the International System of Units, previously used in GSFCâ€™S Satellite
Situation Report and most European publications. NASA was the first
Federal agency to adopt this policy.
   General editor of this volume was the Deputy NASA Historian, Frank
W. Anderson, Jr., and the technical editor was Mrs. Carrie E. Kare-
geannes. The entire NASA Historical Office participated in source selec-
tion, review, and publication. Archivist Lee D. Saegesser collects cur-
rent documentation. The Science and Technology Division of the Li-
brary of Congress, under an exchange of funds agreement, drafts
monthly segments in comment edition form, which are circulated for
corrections and use. At the Library Mrs. Patricia D. Davis, Mrs. Carmen
B. Brock-Smith, and Mrs. Shirley M. Singleton carry principal respodsi-
bility. At the end of the year, the entire manuscript is reworked to in-
clude comments received and recent additional information. Arthur G .
Renstrom of the Library of Congress prepared the extensive index,
which is indispensable to the usefulness of a chronology. The index
 serves also as a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms used in the
chronology.
   Appendix A, â€œSatellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights,
 1970,â€ Appendix B, â€œChronology of Major NASA Launches, 1970,â€ and
Appendix C, â€œChronology of Manned Space Flight, 1970,â€ were pre-
pared by Leonard C. Bruno of the Library staff. Appendix D, â€œAbbrevi-
ations of References,â€ was prepared by Mrs. Brock-Smith.
   Without the validation throughout NASA and other Federal agencies,
the content of this volume would be less reliable and less nearly com-
 plete. Comments, additions, and criticisms are always welcomed by the
 NASA Historical Office.

                              January 1970

January I : Apollo 11 lunar landing had been voted biggest news story of
    1969 in poll of Associated Press member newspapers and radio and
    TV stations, AP announced. Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Apollo
     t I commander, had been voted top newsmaker of year. AP poll
    ranked Vietnam war second biggest story and â€œstory of Sen. Ed-
    ward M. Kennedyâ€™s political fortunesâ€ third. (Rock, AP, W Star,
    1/1/70, A3)
0 President Nixon in San Clemente, Calif., signed National Environ-
    mental Policy Act of 1969. Act declared Government policy â€œto
    create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can ex-
    ist in productive harmony and fulfill the social, economic, and other
    requirements of present and future generations of Americans.â€ It
    established within Presidential Executive Office full-time, three-
    member Council on Environmental Quality and required President
    to submit environmental quality reports to Congress annually, be-
    ginning July l , 1970. President said that â€œthe 1970â€™s absolutely must
    be the years when America pays its debt to the past by reclaiming
    the purity of its air, its waters, and our living environment. It is liter-
    ally now or never.â€ (PD, 1/5/70, 11-3)
0 Dr. Charles H. Townes, Nobel Prize winning Univ. of California
    physicist and member of NAS Council, was appointed Chairman of
    NAS-NRC Space Science Board. Dr. Townes had headed President
    Nixonâ€™s task force to make recommendations on national space
     program in 1969. (NASPIO; NAS-NRC-NAE News Rpt, 3/70; A&A38)
January 2: Nike-Apache sounding rocket was launched by NASA from
    TERLS carrying Indian payload to study ionosphere. Rocket and in-
    struments functioned satisfactorily. (SR list)
* ApoJJo 10 and I 1 photos of lunar far side had revealed number of
    probable igneous intrusions, including three probable dikes that
    crosscut wall and floor of 75-km (46.6-mi) crater, Farouk El-Baz of
    Bellcomm, Inc., reported in Science. Intrusions were distinguished
    by their settings, textures, structures, and brightness. Recognition
    of probable igneous intrusions in lunar highlands supported indica-
    tions of heterogeneity of lunar materials and plausibility of intrusive
    igneous activity on moon, in addition to extrusive volcanism. (Sci-
     ence, 1/2/70,49-50)
0 Results of study of infrared spectra recorded by Mariner VI and V Z        Z
    were reported in Science by Univ. of California at Berkeley
    chemists Kenneth C. Herr and Dr. George C. Pimentel. Reflections
              suggested presence of solid carbon dioxide in upper atmos-
    at 4 . 3 ~
    phere of Mars. (Science, 1/2/70,47-9)
* MSC announced appointment of Sigurd A. Sjoberg as Director of
     Flight Operations, replacing Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., who had
     been appointed MSC Deputy Director. Sjoberg had been Deputy

   Director of Flight Operations since 1963. Appointment was effective
   Dec. 28, 1969. (MSC Release 70-1)
0 With advent of SST, information on meteorological conditions at high-
   er levels of stratosphere would be needed for routine civil-aviation
   operations, Frederick G . Finger and Raymond M. McInturff of
   ESSAâ€™S Weather Bureau said in Science. Forecast system would be
   extended from 12-km (7.5-mi) to 20-km (12.4-mi) altitudes or higher.
   Forecasting techniques to support SST might be facilitated by ex-
   ploiting similarities between stratosphere and troposphere weather.
   Much remained to be done on phenomenon forecasting. Wind ef-
   fects should be smaller for SST than for subsonic aircraft but wind
   forecasts might be necessary during winter, when variations were
   high enough to effect economics of operation. Knowledge of tem-
   perature fields and of ozone distribution could prove valuable. Pos-
   sible solar cosmic radiation hazards would be minimized by ground-
   based forecasting system and onboard detection equipment but son-
   ic boom problem at ground level might be less tractable. Amplifica-
   tion and attenuation of boom by meteorological conditions could be
   predicted. World Weather Watch of U.N. and ESSAâ€™S satellites and
   spacecraft with ability to depict continuous three-dimensional tem-
   perature distribution and wind pressure over entire globe would play
    major role in providing SST meteorological information, as would
    ssritself. (Science, 1/2/70, 16-24)
January 3: Photos of falling meteorite were taken by automatic cameras
   at Hominy, Okla., and Pleasanton, Kans., field stations of Prairie
   Network operated for NASA by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa-
   tory (SAO). Fireball was observed over large area of midwestern
    U.S. Observatory scientist Dr. Richard E . McCrosky later predict-
   ed from film records probable impact point near Lost City, Okla.
    Meteorite entered earthâ€™s atmosphere at 56 300 k m per hr (35 000
    mph), creating trail that was visible for nine seconds. (SAO Release
   70-01; McElheny, Boston Globe, 1/20/70)
0 Accuracy of Apoflo 12 LM lunar landing was described by Henry S. F.
    Cooper, Jr., in post-mission report from KSC published by the New
    Yorker. After successful completion of mission, Cooper had talked
    with Flight Dynamics Officer David Reed, who had been in charge
    of LM trajectory during lunar landing. Cooper reported that Reed
    and other flight engineers had been â€œtoo accurate in plotting their
    trajectory, for Commander (now Captain) Charles Conrad, Jr., who
    was at the controls, had to change the LMâ€™S landing point at the last
    minute. â€˜He was afraid heâ€™d land right on top of the Surveyor if he
    kept on going according to plan, and later, when we fed the data
    from the LM into a computer, we found that if heâ€™d gone on in the
    way he was, he would have hit it,â€™ Reed told me.â€ (New Yorker,
    1/3/70,46-56)
January 4: Lunar Science Institute near MSC in Houston, Tex., was dedi-
   cated at ceremonies attended by Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Ad-
    ministrator, other NASA officials, and some 70 space scientists who
   had gathered early for Jan. 5 opening of Apollo I I Lunar Science
    Conference at MSC. Dr. Paine said, â€œThis is the institution to help us
    bring all the expertise we need together to solve the riddles of the
    moon.â€ LSI, created by 49-university Universities Space Research
    Assn., had one-year contract with NASA, renewable annually. Facili-

   ties would be open to all scientists, including those from Iron Cur-
   tain countries. Dr. William W. Rubey, Univ. of California and Rice
    Univ. geologist, would be Director. ( H Post, 1/5/70)
0 Budget limits had caused cancellation of one lunar landing and
    stretchout of remaining seven Apollo missions into 1974, Dr.
   George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said in interview fol-
   lowing LSI dedication in Houston, Tex. Eighth lunar landing had
   been dropped to permit use of Saturn V rocket to launch first U.S.
   space station in July 1972. (UPI, NYT, 1/5/70, 1)
0 Capt. W. J. Bright of Ascot, England, was named provisional winner
   of 1970 London-Sydney Air Race after flying Britten-Norman Is-
    lander aircraft 19 300 km (12 000 mi) from Gatwick Airport, Lon-
    don, to Bankstown Airport, Sydney, Australia, in 76 hrs elapsed
   time. Second and third prizes in $1 12 000 competition to commemo-
   rate 1919 England-to-Australia flight of Ross and Keith Smith were
   won by Australian pilot Jack Masling in Cessna 310 and British pilot
   Brian Holland in Piper Twin Comanche B. (Trumbull, NYT, 1/5/70,
   61)
January 5: NASA launched two Nike-Cajun sounding rockets carrying
   GSFC grenade experiments. One was launched from Churchill Re-
   search Range; other was launched from Wallops Station. Rockets

0 ERC announced development of silicon carbide diode that had sur-
   vived and functioned over temperature range of 889 K (1600Â°F)-
   from 978 K (+ 1300Â°F) to 89 K (-300Â°F). Diode was believed to be
   first of its kind to withstand extremely high temperatures while per-
   forming effectively as detector of high-frequency radiation at fre-
   quencies to 10 billion cps and would be operable at Venus surface
   temperatures-about 700 K (800Â°F). Diode was developed by ERCâ€™S

0 Time magazine named â€œthe Middle Americansâ€ its Men and Women
   of the Year: â€œThey sent Richard Nixon to the White House and two
   teams of astronauts to the moon. They were both exalted and afraid.
   The mysteries of space were nothing. . .compared with the menac-
   ing confusions of their own society.â€ Middle Americans admired
    â€œmen like Neil Armstrong and, to some extent, Spiro Agnew.â€
    Apollo 1 1 and 12 were â€œa quintessential adventure of American
   technology and daring.â€ Astronauts were â€œparagons of Middle
   American aspiration. Redolent of charcoal cookouts, their vocabu-
   laries an engaging mix of space jargon and â€˜gee whiz,â€™ the space ex-
   plorers gave back to Middle America a v!ctory of its own values. It
   was little noted, except in Middle America where such things still
    matter, that among Neil Armstrongâ€™s extraterrestrial baggage was a
    special badge of his college fraternity, Phi Delta Theta. He used it
    symbolically to establish Moon Alpha Chapter.â€ Some liberals had
    â€œgrumbled that the Apollo programâ€™s $26 billion would have been
   better spent on curing hunger or the urban malaise.â€ Yet Middle
   Americans â€œreveled in the lunar landings precisely because they
   were victories purely accomplished; in Vietnam, in the carious
    slums, in the polluted environment, no clear victories seemed possi-

January 5-9: Apollo I 1 Lunar Science Conference at MSC presented re-
   sults of first systematic studies of lunar samples by more than 500
   scientists from nine countries. Samples from Tranquility Base con-
   sisted of basaltic igneous rocks; microbreccias, which were me-
   chanical mixture of soil and small rock fragments compacted into
   coherent rock; and lunar soil. Soil was mixture of crystalline and
   glassy fragments with small fragments of iron meteoroids. Most
   rock fragments derived from larger igneous rocks-probably once
   part of underlying bedrock. Some crystalline fragments might have
   come from Highlands near Tranquility site. Rocks and fragments in
   soil showed evidence of surface erosion from hypervelocity impacts
   accompanied by local melting, splashing, evaporation, and conden-
   sation. Crystalline rocks ranged from fine-grained vesicular to vug-
   gy, medium-grained equigranular.
       Most common minerals found were pyroxene, plagioclase, ilmen-
   ite, olivine, and cristobalite. Three new minerals occurring in ig-
   neous rocks were pyroxmanganite, ferropseudobrookite, and chro-
   mium-titanium spinel. Free metallic iron and troilite, rare on earth,
   were common accessory minerals in igneous rocks. Silicate miner-
   als were unusually transparent because of complete absence of hy-
   drothermal alteration. Tests had shown that, at time of crystalliza-
   tion, observed phases could have coexisted only in very dry, highly
   reducing system in which oxygen pressure was estimated to be 10-13
   atmospheres-more than five orders of magnitude lower than for
   typical terrestrial basaltic magmas.
       Melting experiments indicated 98% of primary igneous liquid
   crystallized in 1483-1333 K (1210-1060Â°C) temperature range with
    minor interstitial liquids continuing to crystallize down to 1223 K
   (95OOC). Microscopic and microprobe examinations had produced
    evidence for existence of interstitial liquid rich in potassium and
    aluminum, which probably was immiscible with main liquid. Viscos-
    ity of lunar magmas was calculated anorder of magnitude below that
    of terrestrial basaltic magmas. This characteristic might be signifi-
    cant in explaining textural features, differentiation mechanisms that
    produced chemical composition, and morphological features of lu-
    nar seas.
       Chemical compositions of all igneous rocks were similar except
    for concentration of potassium, rubidium, cesium, uranium, tho-
    rium, and barium. These elements distinguished two groups of ig-
    neous rocks, with fine-grained rocks containing more than coarse-
    grained rocks. All rocks had high concentrations of titanium, scan-
    dium, zirconium, hafnium, yttrium, and trivalent rare earth ele-
    ments, and low concentrations of sodium. Low abundance of euro-
    pium was striking feature of igneous rocks. Composition of soils
    and breccias was similar to but distinguishable from igneous rocks.
    Igneous rocks contained at least one other â€œrockâ€ component dis-

                                    4

   tinct from lunar basalts sampled. Soil was rich in nickel and volatile
   elements-cadmium, zinc, silver, gold, copper, and thallium-that
   occurred in carbonaceous chondrites. Enrichment was consistent
   with observed occurrence of meteorite material in soil.
      Many elements that occurred in low abundance in lunar igneous
   rocks were strongly enriched in terrestrial crustal rocks that were
   product of igneous differentiation. It had been suggested that low
   abundance of these elements derived from residual lunar liquids was
   indication that whole moon was depleted in number of volatile ele-
   ments. If inference was correct, it could be inferred that lunar mate-
   rial separated from high-temperature, dispersed nebula at 1273 K
   (lOOOÂ°C) or higher.
      Coincidence of high abundance of titanium, separation of euro-
   pium from other rare earth elements, and separation of barium and
   strontium suggested igneous liquids were end product of fractional
   crystallization process or, less likely, that they were produced by
   partial melting and subsequent segregation of liquid in lunar interior.
      High-pressure and temperature experiments had shown that ma-
   terials with chemical composition of Tranquility Base basalts
   would, at conditions inferred for lunar interior, have densities ex-
   ceeding moonâ€™s average density. Therefore, basalts could not repre-
   sent moonâ€™s bulk composition.
      Age of basaltic crystalline rock was determined at 3.7 billion yrs.
   Igneous rocks were melted and crystallized about 10 billion yrs after
   moonâ€™s formation. Single exotic rock fragment had yielded age of
   4.4 billion yrs and indicated variability in age between different
   areas on lunar surface. Relatively young basalts showed moon had
   not been completely dead planet from its formation, but that it had
   undergone significant differentiation, at least locally, in thin lunar
   crust. Period before 3.7-billion-yr event recorded in older Highland
   areas was interval in which earthâ€™s record had been obliterated.
   Therefore much of lunar surface was important in understanding
   early evolution and differentiation of planets.
      Observations showed lunar materials were product of consider-
   able geochemical and petrological evolution. Optical properties of
   soil measured in laboratories agreed with those inferred from teles-
   copic studies and indicated thin layer of soil must have covered
   most of moon. Correlation of spectral features determined in labo-
   ratory with telescopic studies suggested that iron content of lunar
   surface might vary. Measured dielectric constant of soil agreed with
   known radar reflectivity of moon. Penetration depth suggested up-
   per layers were electrically transparent. Measured thermal conduc-
   tivity suggested that diurnal variations in temperature should extend
   to less than one meter in soil regions. Thermoluminescence studies
   on core samples showed substantial diurnal variation in temperature
   12 cm (4.7 in) below surface.
      Seismic study showed that attenuation of lunar sound waves de-
   creased with pressure. High-pressure velocities were consistent
   with those observed in Apollo 12 seismic experiments, suggesting
   possibility of seismic wave guide at shallow depths on moon. Natu-
   ral remanent magnetization found in crystalline rocks and breccias
   suggested ancient moon might have had magnetic field with strength
   of few percent of earthâ€™s field. Field existing 3.7 billion yrs ago

   might have been result of fluid motions in lunar interior-effect of
   earthâ€™s field when moon and earth were closer together or result of
   processes not yet understood.
      Lunar samples were valuable for study of low-energy, weakly
   penetrating radiations and had provided sample of gases blown off
   sun in solar wind, making it possible to determine isotopic composi-
   tion and abundance of elements in sun by direct measurement. Re-
   sults would lead to better understanding of sunâ€™s evolution. Studies
   of stored nuclear tracks and induced radioactivities had shown ef-
   fect of bombardment by solar flare particles and suggested activity
   had persisted for long periods. Abundance of cosmic-ray-produced
   nuclides in samples showed some rocks had been on or within sever-
   al centimeters of lunar surface for at least 10 million yrs and within
   one or two meters (three to six and a half feet) for at least 500 mil-
   lion yrs.
      In search for life origins on moon, micropaleontological examina-
   tion of sample by optical microscopy and by electron and scanning
   electron microscopy had produced uniformly negative results. In-
   tensive search for viable organisms using many environmental and
   media combinations had produced negative results, as had the one
   quarantine study.

       Cambridge Univ. astronomer Dr. Fred Hoyle was principal
   speaker at banquet given by National Space Hall of Fame and City
   of Houston during conference. He said it was significant that in year
   when men first set foot on another world, desire to save their own
   planet had suddenly blossomed. â€œQuite suddenly everyone world-
    wide has become seriously interested in protecting the environment.
    Something new has happened to create this feeling of awareness
    about our planet.â€ He warned that man had to face probability that
    he could no longer discover important physical laws solely by ob-
    servation in earth laboratories. â€œWe are in a transition period, and
    in the future we must rely more on outside laboratories than astron-
    omers did in the past.â€ (Burgess, CSM, 1/8/70)

    planets were accreting from interplanetary grains. Hence, in order
    to understand how the solar system originated it may be essential to
    explore the asteroids.â€ Since manned Mars landing would take
    place after 1980, â€œit is of interest to discuss whether a sample of an
    asteroid may be obtained in an easier way, at an earlier time, and as
    a technologically intermediate step.â€ Asteroid sample could be ob-
    tained by landing spacecraft on asteroid or by capturing small aster-

  Nixon Administration had decided against big space program for
0
    1970s, Thomas Oâ€™Toole wrote in Washington Post. There would be
    â€œno set goal for landing men on Mars, no plan to colonize the moon
   and no sudden push to orbit a permanent manned space station
   above the earth in the next five years.â€ While space program would
    â€œnot be allowed to shrink muchâ€ in 1970, Administration would ask
   Congress for no more than $3.7 billion for space in FY 1971, â€œthe
   lowest request for space funds in almost a decade.â€ Low funding
   level meant space spending would not rise above $4 billion annually
   for at least several years and new programs would not be started in

    vironment had doubled after first lunar landing. â€œTo many, the
    flights raised the question of where technological priorities should
    be directed-into space or back on the earth?â€ Some astronauts had
    said that from space, air pollution was so visible it cut into the joy of
    seeing earth from hundreds or thousands of miles away. Articles
    examined â€œwhat man has done to his envirpnment, and what he can
    do to save it.â€ Observers saw â€œgreat promiseâ€ in National Environ-

    1980â€™s that will inaugurate vast savings in fuel resources and costsâ€;
    use of abundant cheap power for desalting seawater and introducing
    new industrial processes; use of nuclear fission as power source;
    and melding of nuclear and space ages â€œas nuclear energy becomes
    a major source of auxiliary and propulsive power for space activi-
    ties.â€ SNAP systems for nuclear auxiliary power would become
    â€œprinciple source of electricity in space.â€ Seventies also would see
    expanded use of nuclear explosives for peaceful purposes, such as
    power source for navaids, for underground excavation in stimulat-
    ing production of natural gas, and in extraction of minerals from
    low-grade ores and oil from oil shales. Advances were expected in
    use of radioisotopes in medicine, agriculture, and industry and in

* Editorial by Robert Hotz in Aviation Week & Space Technology out-
   lined space outlook for 1970: â€œSpace will. . .see some titanic strug-
   gles in the market-place as the key programs in the space transporta-
   tion system of the mid-1970s come up for contractor selection.
   Many observers will be misled by the relatively small dollar increas-
   es in Fiscal 1971 space budgets. Many new programs can be initiated
   with the same level of funding that was required for the Apollo era,
   plus some heavy reprogramming of existing projects that are ap-
   proaching technical obsolescence much faster than any planners
   imagined. By judiciously paring its present programs and getting
   only a modest boost for Fiscal 1971, NASA can lay the foundations
   for the next decadeâ€™s major space program. Military space, tempo-
   rarily deflated by the manned orbiting laboratory cancellation, will
   trend toward a broader program involving several major new fields.
   Commercial and nOn-NASA space will provide a modestly expanding
   market, and the big battle between celestial and terrestrial commu-
   nications is shaping into a major clash.â€ (Av Wk, 1/12/70, 11)
January 13: Dr. Thomas 0 . Paine, NASA Administrator, said at NASA
   Hq. news conference on future plans he was directing portions of
    space program to bring operations in line with FY 1971 budget. â€œWe
   recognize the many important needs and urgent problems we face
   here on earth. Americaâ€™s space achievements in the 1960â€™s have
   rightly raised hopes that this country and all mankind can do more to
   overcome pressing problems of society. The space program should
   inspire bolder solutions and suggest new approaches. It has already
   provided many direct and indirect benefits and is creating new
    wealth and capabilities.â€ Strong space program continued as one of
   Nationâ€™s major priorities. â€œHowever, we recognize that under cur-
   rent fiscal restraints NASA must find new ways to stretch out current
   programs and reduce our present operational base.â€ NASA would
    â€œpress forward in 1971 at a reduced level, but in the right direction
    with the basic ingredients we need for major achievements in the
    1970s and beyond. . . .we will not dissipate the strong teams that
    sent men to explore the moon and automated spacecraft to observe
   the planets.â€
      NASAwould suspend Saturn V production indefinitely after Sat-
   urn V 515 completion, stretch Apollo lunar missions to six-month
   launch intervals, defer lunar expeditions during AAP space station
   flights in 1972, and postpone VikinglMars 1973 unmanned lander
   launch to next Mars opportunity in 1975. Number of employees in
   NASA program was expected to decline from 190000 at end of FY
    1970 to 140 000 at close of FY 1971.

        Positive aspects of space program for 1970s included Apollo mis-
     sions through Apollo 19, use of one Saturn V to launch first experi-
     mental AAP space station into earth orbit in 1972, Mars orbit by two
     unmanned spacecraft in 1971, launch of first Jupiter probe in !972,
     launch of spacecraft past Venus to Mercury in 1973, and continua-
     tion of scientific satellite launches.
        Design of reusable space shuttle would be started and first experi-
     mental space station would be launched, as planned, in 1972. FY
     1971 budget would permit proceeding with design of advanced space
     station as permanent base in earth orbit, continued work on NASA-
     AEC NERVA project, practical earth applications of space technolo-
     gy, and advances in applications of space technology in fields such
     as meteorology and communications. Although â€œaustere,â€ space
     program for 1971 was â€œforward lookingâ€ and contained â€œbasic in-
     gredients needed for an effective space program in the 1970s.â€ It
     would â€œextend our space capabilities, expand our scientific
     knowledge, and make available new applications of benefit to peo-
     ple here on earth.â€
        In response to question, Dr. Paine said he foresaw no shutdown
     of KSC and had no plans for closing other centers. Intended actions
     â€œrepresent a decision to proceed through the year 1971 and see what
     our studies turn up. I think it is important to realize these are very
     advanced, perhaps, and we have a lot to learn about the technologi-
     cal feasibility, the cost, schedules-and I wouldnâ€™t want to say we
     now have a complete free road into the future. We donâ€™t.â€™â€™ Asked if
     he thought NASA was close to point where â€œteam started falling to
     pieces,â€ Dr. Paine said that â€œyou can carry out space programs for
     the United States at a large number of different levels. I think the
     level we have now is a level we can take great pride in and I think
     the country in the 1970â€™s will be very proud of the achievements
      NASA will turn in.â€ (Transcript)

     tem. Itos I weighed 306 kg (675 1bs)-more than twice as much as
     previous TOS satellites-and carried both automatic picture trans-
      mission (APT) and advanced vidicon camera system (AVCS) camer-
     as, previously carried on separate missions. Satellite was box-
     shaped with three-panel solar array and had new â€œstabiliteâ€ three-
     axis stabilization system. Onboard experiments included two redun-
     dant AVCS cameras for stored global cloud-cover data for remote
     readout; two redundant APT cameras for local readout of global
     cloud-cover data; redundant scanning radiometers for global cloud-
     cover data for remote and local readout, both day and night; flat-
     plate radiometer for data on global heat balance; and solar proton
     monitor for routine observation of solar flares. Spacecraft would
     more than double daily weather coverage possible from ESSA satel-
     lites already in orbit and give more effective coverage at less ex-
     pense for longer time. Nighttime photo capability would provide
     cloud-cover photos night and day every 12 hrs; ESSA series provided
     one picture per day.
         Itos I was 19th spacecraft to be launched in NOMSS. First, Tiros I,
      had been launched April 1, 1960; last, Essa IX, had been launched
      Feb. 26, 1969. Itos I was funded by NASA except for meteorological
      sensors; KSC was responsible for launch operations and GSFC was
      responsible for Delta booster. Future ITOS spacecraft would be
      funded by ESSA and would be turned over to ESSA by NASA after
      postlaunch checkout. (NASA Proj O f NASA Release 70-2)

  At annual meeting of American Physical Society in Chicago, sympos-
@


    ium on cosmic physics suggested stellar explosion could have pre-
    cipitated condensation of dust and gas to form sun and planets.
    Analysis of meteorite discovered several years earlier at St. Sever-
    in, France, had led to suggestion by Cal Tech physicist Dr. Gerald J .
    Wasserburg that great stellar explosion had accompanied or imme-
    diately preceded formation of solar system, Walter Sullivan said in
    New York Times. Meteorite had contained calcium phosphate crys-
    tals in tiny tracks of particles ejected by radioactive atoms. Suspect-
    ed source was plutonium 244-element manufactured in laboratory
    but not found in nature. Because plutonium 244â€™s mean lifetime was
    only 118 million yrs, any plutonium in earth rocks or meteorites,
    both more than 4.5 billion yrs old, would have decayed radioactively
    unless something occurred just before or during solar systemâ€™s for-
    mation that synthesized this substance. According to Wasserburg
    hypothesis, material was incorporated into meteorite where, during
    solar systemâ€™s infancy, it decayed possibly into neutron-rich forms,
    or isotopes, of xenon found in meteorite, leaving radiation tracks.

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1970

   tions Compare? Report by Dr. Charles S. Sheldon 11, Chief of Sci-
   ence Policy Div., summarized 12-yr efforts of major space powers.
   U.S. expected to have spent by June 30, 1970, just over $56 billion
   on combined military and civilian space programs in which some
   half million persons had been employed. It was likely U.S.S.R. had
   â€œcommitted a similar amount of resources.â€ U.S. space employ-
   ment had peaked; Soviet had not, â€œas judged by their rising number
   of launchings.â€ There was no evidence that total Soviet aerospace
   industry was as fully equipped as U.S., but missiles of differing de-
   sign philosophies seen in Moscow parades suggested â€œmore than
   one design and development team for space work just as in Soviet
   aviation.â€ Each country seemed adequately equipped with launch
   pads. U.S.S.R. claimed nationwide tracking system but relied on
   ships to fill gaps.
       U.S.S.R. was still using ICBM with 1400-kg (3000-lb) thrust and
   improved staging to boost 4700-kg (10 400-lb) Vostok and 6600-kg
   (14500-lb) Soyuz. Proton launch vehicle had carried 16800 kg
   (37 000 Ibs) to earth orbit and might have potential to lift 27 200 kg
   (60 000 lbs) with circumlunar capacity of 6000 kg (14 500 Ibs). â€œWe
   have not yet seen the very large Soviet vehicle confidently predicted
   by NASA officials the last three years. Lesser Soviet launch vehi-
   cles account for unmanned programs.â€ There was no sign of Soviet
   breakthrough in fuels â€œbut their engines are run at relatively high
   pressure, increasing efficiency.â€ There was no sign that solid-fuel
   rockets had been used by U.S.S.R. for space purposes and question
   of Soviet development of nuclear rocket was â€œhighly speculative.â€
   Soviet work on electric rockets had reached only â€œearly proof-of-
   principleâ€ stage. U.S. Saturn V was â€œclearly the best operational
   weight lifter in the world.â€
       Odds were â€œoverwhelmingâ€ that Vladimir Komarov had been
   only Soviet Cosmonaut killed in space so far. â€œThis is because the
   Russians have followed a conservative approach to manned flight
   with heavy vehicles allowing much redundancy in equipment.â€
       There seemed to be â€œlittle difference between the Soviet and U.S.
   space programs as to general purpose and direction.â€ About three
   fifths of U.S. flights were conducted for DOD; similar heavy military
   emphasis existed in U.S.S.R. â€œSoviet Union has a large and regular
   program of military support flights including use of satellites for
   photographic observation, electronic listening, weather reporting,
   communications relaying, and ship navigation.â€ U.S. did not have
    FOB program, â€œbecause it does not regard them as necessary or de-
    sirable. The Russians obviously do, for reasons not wholly clear.â€
   While assessment could not be conclusive, â€œsuspicion remains that
    a capability to inspect and destroy satellites has been createdâ€ by
   U.S.S.R.

During January: SpacelAeronautics reviewed status of aerospace and
   aeronautical projects at commencement of 1970s. Commercial
   transport industry was â€œmicrocosm of the capitalistic system. The
   health of any constituent, SST or airbus or Stol, is on trial in a harsh-
   ly profit-motivated atmosphere that says. . . â€˜shape up or ship out.â€™
   Nowhere is this test more evident than in the troubled, hesitant pos-
   ture of the U.S. SST program.â€ With retrenchment to fixed-wing
   design â€œand a continual dropback in the urgency level of our SST
   effort,â€ SSTâ€™S competitive advantages were â€œbeing dissipated by an
   inexorable calendar.â€
       Apolfo I 1 lunar landing had alleviated Cciigressional opposition
   to further expensive long-term space commitments. â€œSuddenly, it
   was practical to think of going ahead with an expanded lunar explo-
   ration program.â€
       Space science and applications program had been marking time,
   â€œwith most programs stretched out to match the diminished funding
   made smaller still by the nasty bite of inflation.â€ But â€œlight is begin-
   ning to show at the end of the long, dark tunnel of fiscal retrench-
   ment.â€ Success of satellite infrared spectrometer (SIRS), â€œwelcome
   and long overdue test of ATS-3â€ for coast-to-coast relay of TV pro-
   grams, and climb in â€œCornsatâ€™s â€™69 operating profilesâ€ above $1-
   million mark had led space science program steadily to shift â€œits
   dollar focus away from the earth.â€
       Civil system activity by aerospace community was only token.
    â€œYet 1969 may prove to have been a landmark year for the indus-
    tryâ€™s relations with this strange and often self-contradictory market.
    New initiatives by the federal government indicate a growing aware-
    ness in Washington of what aerospace may be able to contribute to
    the solution of complex civil problems.â€ (SIA, 1/70,27-69,81-132)

February 2: President Nixon in message transmitting FY 1971 budget to
      Congress said: â€œMan has ventured to the moon and returned-an
      awesome achievement. In determining the proper pace for future
      space activities, we must carefully weigh the potential benefits of:
      scientific research by unmanned spacecraft; continued exploration
      of the solar system, including manned exploration of the planets;
      and the a plication of space and aeronautics technology to the di-
      rect bene l! t of mankind.
         â€œI have reviewed many exciting alternatives for the future. Con-
      sistent with other national priorities, we shall seek to extend our
     capabilities in space-both manned and unmanned. I intend to do
      this within total space outlays 12% smaller than in 1970. In our cur-
      rent efforts, we will continue to stress additional uses of space tech-
      nology. Our actions will make it possible to begin plans for a
      manned expedition to Mars.â€
         President said national budget, first for which he bore full respon-
      sibility, fulfilled pledge to submit balanced FY 1971 budget. â€œThis
      anti-inflationary budget begins the necessary process of reordering
      our national priorities. For the first time in two full decades, the
      Federal Government .will spend more money on human resource
      programs than on national defense.â€ About 41% of estimated out-
      lays would be devoted to spending for education and manpower,
      health, income security, and veterans benefits and services. Pollu-
      tion control, crime reduction, transportation, and housing programs
      were â€œplanned to grow substantially in the years ahead.â€ (PD,       2/9/
      70, 106-19)
    President Nixon sent $200.8-billion FY 1971 budget request to Con-
0
      gress, including total space budget of $4.954 billion. Of this sum,
      NASA would receive $3.148 billion (plus $185.5 million for aircraft
      technology); DOD would receive $1.674 billion; AEC, $99 million;
      ESSA, $26 million; De t. of Interior, $4 million; NSF, $2 million; and
      Dept. of Agriculture, E 1 million.
          Total NASA new obligational authority (NOA) requested, $3.333
      billion, was $404.9 million less than FY 1970 NOA of $3.737 billion.
      NASA expenditures were budgeted to decline $486.4 million, from
      FY 1970 level of $3.889 billion to $3.403 billion. Reductions placed
      proposed NASA FY 1971 funding at lowest level since 1962. Of bud-
      get request, $2.606 billion would go for R&D, $34.6 million for con-
      struction of facilities, and $692.3 million for research and program
      management.
         Apollo funding decrease of $729.6 million, to $956.50 million in
      FY 1971, reflecting successful completion of manned lunar landing
      goal, would be partially offset by increase to $515.2 million for
      manned space flight operations. The $515.2 million would include
      $364.3 million for Apollo Applications, $110 million for space shut-

    tie and station, and $40.9 million for operations. Advanced missions
    would receive $2.5 million, same as in FY 1970, to bring total for
    manned space flight to $1.474 billion, down $557.5 million from FY
    1970.
        Funding for space science and applications programs would in-
    crease $45.9 million, from $519.7 million in FY 1970 to $565.7 mil-
    lion. Increases would go to physics and astronom program, for air-
    borne research ($3 million), solar observatories ($16.1 million), and
    Explorer satellites ($25.6 million). Funding for Pioneer program of
      lanetary exploration would increase from $20 million in FY 1970 to
    E 32.9 million. Funding for biosatellites would decrease from $6 mil-
    lion in FY 1970 to $1.5 million. Earth resources survey would re-
    ceive more than 50% increase in funding, from $26 million to $52.5
    million, with $41.5 million allocated for Earth Resources Technolo-
    gy Satellite. New projects funded were navigation and traffic control
    studies (with DOT), $3 million, and Global Atmospheric Research
    Program (GARP) study, $1 million.
       Total for advanced research and technology programs would be
    reduced from $272 million in FY 1970 to $264 million. NERVA rocket
    funding would increase from $27 million to $32 million. Increases
    also were proposed for V/STOL aircraft technology ($15 million in
    FY 1971, from $9.5 million in FY 1970), subsonic aircraft technolo-
    gy($11.9 million, from $9.4 million in FY 1970), and supersonic air-
    craft technology ($21.9 million, from $18.9 million in FY 1970),
    within total $185.5 million requested for aeronautics.
        Sustaining university program was being phased out, with no
    funds requested for FY 1971.
        DOD space funding, down $82 million, reflected cancellation of
    MOL program. FY 1971 funding would support satellite develop-
    ment, portions of missile development, and range operations.
        AECâ€™S requested $99 million reflected slight decreases for develop-
    ment of NERVA rocket and space nuclear electric power sources for
    space applications.
        Funds for Depts. of Interior and Agriculture would support par-
    ticipation in ERTS project. NSFâ€™s $2-million space funding was for
    research rockets and satellite and observation instruments.
        FAA 1971 budget reflected restoration of $275 million in Federal
    funds for development of two prototype SSTS. (NASA Release, 2/21

  N A s A H q . briefing on FY 1971 budget, held Jan. 31, was released. Dr.
    Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, had said: â€œWe are putting
    into motion with this budget a program which does not advance
    toward a single climactic event. It follows the recommendations of
    the Space Task Group Reportâ€™s Option 11, although at a reduced
    pace. The budget to implement the recommendations, however, is
    austere and, as a result, does not take full advantage of our total
    capability. But the new program has the flexibility to accommodate
    this reduced budget in FY 1971.â€
        Lowest NASA budget since FY 1962 â€œmeans substantial cutbacks
    and deferrals in a number of programs. Our best current estimate is
    that the total nationwide employment on NASA work-which was
    once 420,000 people-will decline from current level by another
    45,000, to about 144,000 people by the end of fiscal year 1971. The

     impact will be felt in many sections of the country. This is regretta-
     ble, but the Administration has faced the hard fact that these steps
     must be taken to achieve a fiscally responsible balanced budget in
     this time of inflation. . . .this budget level, which we hope will be
     NASAâ€™s lowest level, is strongly oriented to the future. The neces-
     sary reductions. . .have not been made â€˜across the board.â€™ We have
     made careful selections and decisions.â€
        NASA would preserve strong future capability centered on devel-
     opment of economical, reusable space transportation system includ-
     ing shuttle, space station, and reusable nuclear rocket; continue
     efforts on practical applications of space technology for early practi-
     cal benefits on earth; continue lunar exploration with Apollo vehi-
     cles and Apollo Applications earth orbital workshop flights with
     hardware previously under procurement; continue, â€œbut with
     stretchouts and deferrals,â€ balanced program of planetary explora-
     tion and scientific investigations in space focused on potentially ex-
     citing discoveries; continue increasing emphasis on aeronautics; and
     maintain â€œessential cadre of NASAâ€™s technical, operational, and
     management capabilities on which the continuing and future posi-
     tion of the United States in space depends.â€ [See Jan. 13.1
        Assistant Administrator for Administration William E. Lilly dur-
     ing briefing had replied to question that planned fund request for
     space station and shuttle had been for $250 million to $260 million-
     supporting Task Groupâ€™s Option 11, to provide operational systems
     in 1977-but request had been cut to final $110 million. Associate
     Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers had said
     program should give CY 1978 operational date. Dates for Mars mis-
     sion were not yet planned.
        Michoud Assembly Facility and Mississippi Test Facility were
     among NASA installations to be affected by budgetary action, Lilly
     had said. Plans on Michoud would be to â€œcomplete the last of 15
      Saturn 5â€™s in 1970; then we will be carrying on activities for the stor-
     age, repairing and refurbishing of the 1-B and the Saturn 5 stages,
     providing the engineering and support necessary for the flights
     through 1974, and maintaining the capability to restart or reinitiate
     the production of Saturn 5â€™s; maintaining the capability to accept
     new work. . .and. . .attempting to find other. users of that facility in
     New Orleans.â€ At MTF, Saturn V static test firings would be com-
     pleted. â€œThen, the plans in our budget are to mothball the facilities.
     Personnel will be phased down.. .to essentially a mothball or care-
     taker mode.â€ NASA was working with other agencies to seek other

February 3: NASA successfully launched 1500-kg (3300-Ib) Sert
   (Space Electric Rocket Test) from WTR at 6:49 pm PST by Thorad-
   Agena booster. Spacecraft entered orbit with 1008.9-km (626.9-mi)
   apogee, 998.4-km (620.4-mi) perigee, 105.2-min period, and 99.1'
   inclination. Deployment of solar panels, disabling and dumping of
   Agena attitude control system, and transfer of Agena horizon sen-
   sor to spacecraft were accomplished satisfactorily. Spacecraft atti-
   tude was being maintained by gravity gradient forces and control
   moment gyros to well within required limits.
      Primary mission objective was to operate electric ion thruster sys-
   tem in space satisfactorily for six months. Secondary objectives
   were to determine variation of thruster power efficiency with mis-
   sion time: measure RF noise from ion beam in frequency bands asso-
   ciated with interplanetary communications systems; measure extent
   of coupling between ion beam and space plasma; measure magnitude
   of ion engine's thrust by electrostatically suspended accelerometer,
   orbit change, or thruster measurements; measure long-term effects
   of ion thruster efflux on silicon-cell*solar array ;and measure change
   in equilibrium temperature of optically reflective coating in space
   environment.
       Sert II system had large solar array, cylindrical spacecraft sup-
    port unit (ssu), and spacecraft ring housing two ion engines, electric
    propulsion experiments, power conditioning, power switching and
   signaling equipment, and reacquisition control system. ssu housed
   two telemetry transmitters, two command systems, two tape re-
   corders for data storage, power distribution system, battery for
   reacquisition control, and four control moment gyros.
       Sert II was second mission in SERT project. SERT I, launched on
   suborbital mission July 20, 1964, had proved that ion engines could
   produce thrust in space. SERT project was managed by LeRC under
    OART direction. Tracking and data acquisition were conducted by

    President Nixon transmitted to Congress Aeronautics and Space Re-
0
      port of the President for 1969 (dated January 1970). He said: â€œThe
      year 1969 was truly a turning point in the story of space exploration
     -the most significant of any year in that still brief history.â€ U.S.
      had achieved â€œmost prominent of our goals in space-one which
      had long been a focus for our energies. As we enter a new decade,
      we must now set new goals which make sense for the Seventjes. The
      space budget that I am submitting to Congress reflects my view of a
      balanced space program, one which will build on the progress we
      have already made. Our space and aeronautics program has benefit-
      ed this Nation in many ways. It has contributed to our national secu-
      rity, to our educational, transportation, and commercial strength, to
      our scientific and medical knowledge, to our international position
      and to our sense of the dignity and the capacity of man. And the sto-

February 4-6: AIAA held Advanced Space Transportation Meeting at
   Patrick AFB and Cocoa Beach, Fla. In keynote address Charles W.
   Mathews, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space
   Flight, discussed capabilities of NASA reusable space shuttle. â€œIn
   the area of multi-mission and multi-agency use, we are talking and
   thinking in the broadest sense. Certainly, the Department of De-
   fense, in addition to NASA, has many requirements to carry payloads
   into space. Other agencies, the industrial community, and the aca-
   demic community also have been involved in like fashion but have
   been.. .inhibited by the limited capabilities and costs of present
   launch systems and payloads. However, in addition to a higher level
   of participation within our own country, a much greater involve-
   ment is expected internationally because of the fle;ribility and utility
   of the space shuttle. Other nations might utilize a United States
   shuttle to carry and deploy their payloads or carry their personnel to
   a space station, but ultimately, nations or a consortium of nations
   may desire to operate their own shuttles just as foreign airlines oper-
   ate U.S. developed commercial aircraft.â€
      Design baselines at start of Phase B studies of shuttle included 1.6
   million kg (3.5 million Ibs) at liftoff and payload compartment vol-
    ume of 4.6-rn (15-ft) dia by 18.3 rn (60 ft) long.
      Pan American World Airways President Najeeb E. Halaby said
   NASA reusable space shuttle was logical step toward ship for com-
   mercial travel to orbit and back and for point-to-point earth trans-

  â€œAmerican and British space experts believe that the Soviet Union

 February 6: At NASA Hq. industry briefing on space program for 1970s

     too.. .we will still be spending $3.3 billion in the 71 budget, and I

     think by any possible measure that puts the space program very,
     very high in the nationâ€™s priorities.â€ Major reduction would be in
     manned spaceflight â€œfrom a little over $2 billion in FY 70 to $1,-
     474,000,000 in 71.â€ With â€œthe manned lunar landing behind us, with
     almost all the initial buy of 15 vehicles now completed, we are able
     to take a major reduction in the Apollo account as that program
     reaches a logical termination. We had hoped to continue the Saturn
     V at limited production of several a year. The decision was made
     under these austere conditions that we would terminate that produc-
     tion and take the savings.â€
        Peak NASA expenditure of $6 billion in 1965 included outlay for
     buildup of total NASA base. Fact â€œthat we are now down between
     the three and four billion mark by no means means that we will be
     operating at a substantially lower space activity than we had at the
     peak. It reflects more the fact that the base is now completed; we
     can put a much higher percentage of our expenditures into pro-
     gram. â€
        However, FY 1971 budget would delay Apollo Applications flight
     until end of 1972; stretch Apollo lunar flights to two a year, with
     Apollo 16 occurring before AA program launch in 1972-1973 and
     Apollo 17 and 18 after A A program missions; delay ATS-F and ATS-G
     by one year, and Viking-Mars lander from 1973 to 1975; and reduce
     NASA operational base by shutting down ERC and possibly mothball-
     ing Mississippi Test Facility. Dr. Paine said NASA aeronautics effort
     would increase. â€œWe feel that much of the work that will be going
     forward in the shuttle program will probably have some spin-off into
     the aeronautics area.â€ Emphasis would be placed on V/STOL and
     quiet engines.
        Orbiting Solar Observatory launch recommended by Space Task
     Group for 1975 would be delayed to 1976. Interplanetary Monitoring
     Probes originally scheduled for 1971 and 1972 would be launched in
      1972 and 1973 and ISIS would be moved from 1970 and 1972 to 1971
     and 1973. Synchronous Meteorological Satellites each would slip
     one year, to 1972 and 1973, and Applications Technology Satellites,
     one year, to 1973 and 1975. lunar roving vehicle would be carried on
     Apollo 16, 17, 18, and 19. Decision on whether to fund two or three
     space shuttle definition studies would be made after proposals were
     received. In space station area experimental requirements would be
     emphasized. Two Phase-B definition studies were under way.
     Summer study of utilization of space stations would be international
     conference â€œwith, we hope, strong participation from the European
     space research organization.â€ NERVA studies would continue.
        Dale D. Myers, Associate Administrator for Manned Space
      Flight, told conference that â€œwith the technology we already have in
     handâ€ antipollution program could be initiated â€œto produce a space
      reflector-maybe it will have to be a mile [1.6 km] in diameter-that
      can direct the sunâ€™s energy to create holes over our cities which

     or land vehicles; and a variety of capabilities for early warning and
     other defensive space systems.â€ First defense comsat system had
     been transmitting â€œsubstantial load of voice communications be-
     tween Washington and Vietnam since 1967. It can also handle high-
     speed digital data such as tactical reconnaissance photographs. Im-
     proved adaptations of this 26-satellite initial system have been de-

        In yearâ€™s time â€œwe will be launching a still further improved

     communications capability that will enable troops. . .to communi-
     cate with each other in spite of intervening obstacles like mountain
     ranges or enemy forces. Another new defense capability was built
     into our VELA satellites. . .launched in October of 1963 to monitor
     the nuclear test ban treaty.â€ Velas had become â€œoldest man-made
     functioning systems in space; they still respond to command, al-
     though their duties have largely been taken over now by more ad-
     vanced versions.â€ Velas had performed scientific chores like â€œmon-
     itoring the level of solar radiation during manned space flights, to
     ensure against danger to the astronauts.â€
        uSAF navigation satellites under study would permit pinpoint ac-
     curacy in navigation of supersonic aircraft and surface and subsur-
     face vehicles. They held promise for prevention of midair collisions.
      â€œWeâ€™re also doing extensive studies on a space shuttle system that

0 Dr. Charles A. Berry, MSC Director of Medical Research and Opera-
   tions, described medical phenomena encountered by Apollo 12 as-
   tronauts in keynote address at Air Force School of Aerospace Medi-
   cine seminar in San Antonio, Tex. Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr.,
   Richard F. Gordon, Jr., and Alan L. Bean had observed brilliant
   flashes of light on closing eyes in darkened portions of spacecraft.
   They were believed to be caused by charged particles or rays from
   sun or from space. Astronauts also experienced sensitivity to lunar
   dust, body changes including face fullness, reddened eyes, and
   flushed faces during early part of flight, and increase in skin bacteria
   beyond amount normal on earth. Dr. Berry blamed body changes on
   pooling of fluids in head from lack of gravity. Behavior of bacteria
   might make doctors consider altering normal skin surface bacteria
   content by special baths for astronauts before flight.
      Dr. Berry also said that woman might share in planetary explora-
   tion but tests were needed to ensure â€œshe doesnâ€™t create more prob-
   lems than she solves. I think it would definitely be more comfortable
   if we took women along.â€ (Huntsville Times, 2/10/70; Huntsville

    tion $f sustaining university program in FY 1971 would eliminate
    more than 200 predoctoral training grants which had been funded at
    $4.18 million. Funding for multidisciplinary research grants also
    would end. Students would not be cut off immediately, since grants
    had been step-funded and would be reduced over three years. NASA
    Assistant Administrator for University Affairs F. B. Smith said oth-
    er agencies might assume funding of some grants, since university
    R&D funding in total Federal budget would increase by $1 14 million
    during FY 1971. Presidential Science Adviser, Dr. Lee A. Du-
    Bridge, said increase would not compensate for leveling off of R&D
    budgets in past few years nor for effects of inflation. He noted Gov-
    ernment support for graduate students was declining generally and
    said Government did not need as many scientists as previously.
       Total $21 million would be cut by NASA in contracts and grants to
    universities. In OSSA, university R&D grants in bioscience would be
    cut by 30%. Cuts would eliminate a high-energy astronomical ob-

       With termination of Apollo fabrication, 8 Saturn Vs and 6 Saturn
    IBs, 12 CM S and SMS, and 1 or 2 LMS would be available for manned
    flight. After 1974, U.S. would have no capability for lifting manned
    payloads over 27 200 kg (60 000 Ibs) into space and would have only
    three vehicles that could lift 27 200-kg payloads unless Saturn V
    production was resumed or substitute was developed. Launch rate
    of less than two manned vehicles per year could materially increase
    risk of manned launch and spaceflight operations; production rate of
    two or more Apollo spacecraft and launch vehicles per year would
    minimize annual cost without inordinate increases in total vehicle
    cost over current costs, while maintaining critical skills of major
    subcontractors.

    after 1973 without extension of orbital workshop program or initia-
    tion of development of space. station. Early development of low-
    cost earth-to-orbit transportation system appeared to off er greatest

0 Apollo 12 LM in final moments of descent to lunar surface had caused
    dust shower that pocked Surveyor III and sand-blasted camera,
    NASA announced. Burton G. Cour-Palais, Chief of Meteoroid Sci-
    ences Branch at MSC, reported that Surveyor IIITV camera experi-
    enced little meteoroid damage during 950 days of exposure to space
    environment, but had numerous shallow craters of recent origin-
    apparently caused by LM 183 m (600 ft) away. LM-caused craters
    were â€œshallow. . mostly of recent origin, as indicated by their
    whiteness against the sandy brown color of the TV camera housing
    painted surface.â€ White craters were concentrated on arc of TV
    camera facing LM, 10 to 100 times as many as on side away from LM.
    Preliminary assessment of meteoroid impacts indicated more than
    five impacts on camera housing and four on polished tube. (NASA

0 ESSA announced it had received NASA contract to investigate lightning

    hazards to rockets as part of NASA effort to develop lightning-warn-
    ing system and techniques for lightning suppression. Dr. Heinz W.
     Kasemir, head of ESSA research project, said that â€œlaunching a
    rocket through thunder or rain clouds can be hazardous, not so
     much because the rocket will be hit accidently by natural lightning,
    but because the rocket itself may trigger a lightning stroke in the
     storm.â€ NASAâ€™s Apollo 12 had suffered temporary power failure
    from lightning during launch through storm at KSC Nov. 14, 1969.
        Suspected triggering effect of rockets in thunderheads had been
     demonstrated when specially equipped ESSA DC-6 research aircraft
     operated by ESSAâ€™S Research Flight Facility was struck by lightning
     three separate times under similar meteorological conditions during
     thunderstorm research project near Flagstaff, Ariz. Each time light-
     ning struck, aircraft was in dissipating thunderhead near freezing
     level and in area of cloud that contained both ice and water. Corona
     discharge had been audibly detected on aircraft communications
     system for two seconds before each lightning strike. Observations
     of electrical field within the storm before and after lightning bolts
     suggested that aircraft itself, moving through thunderhead, might
     have triggered discharges. (ESSA Release 70-8-30)

    rocks.â€ Only chemical basis of comparison between lunar plains
    and highlands had been provided by Turkevich-designed experiment
    flown on Surveyor mission to highland region near crater Tycho.
    Compared with Apollo 11 lunar sample data, experiment data
    proved plains were darker and denser than highlands because they
    contained twice the abundance of elements heavier than calcium.
    Moonâ€™s chemical content also showed â€œevidence for a crust on the
    moon.â€
       Dr. John A. Wood of Smithsonian Astophysical Observatory pre-
    sented corroborating evidence based on traces of highland material
    in Apollo I 1 samples. He explained meteoroid impact at nearby
    highland area might have showered lighter-colored material-anor-
                   plain where Apollo 11 landed. Anorthositic crust,
    thosite-on
    formed by melting, probably covered moon at one time. Then giant
    craters, which became plains, were blasted into crust by early im-
    pacts and lavas from beneath surface welled into holes and solidi-
    fied. Dr. Wood estimated depth of crust at 24 km (15 mi), but other
    scientists were skeptical.

    sources NASA is emphasizing those projects which help solve imme-
   diate problems and deferring to a later year those major new starts
    whose objectives are primarily to gain the new knowledge. Obvious-
    ly, we cannot continue to defer such promising scientific projects
    indefinitely without mortgaging the economic health, the technical
    progress, and the security of this Nation.

    cause of our active ongoing program. Future Aeronomy and Inter-
    planetary Monitoring Platform (IMP)Explorer missions will be di-
    rected at the earthâ€™s environment: improved OSOâ€™S will study the sun
    and provide data for correlation with ecology studies; the Small As-
    tronomy Satellites (SAS) will start giving us continued data on galac-
    tic x-rays and gamma-rays; and future missions of the OAO will con-
    tinue the successful observation program begun with OAO-2. Before

    and airplanes; and are developing concepts and investigations for
    future missions.â€ Establishing scientific priorities, allocating proper
    resources to research, and deciding between various expensive sci-
    entific projects would continue to be â€œa most difficult problem.â€

       R. B. Marsten, Director of Communications Programs, OSSA, tes-
   tified on broadcast service of NASA advanced flight experimentation
   in satellite communications: â€œBroadcast services come in three
   classes-the distribution class, which, through a relatively small
   satellite, would broadcast program material to large receivers, per-
   haps co-located with local broadcast transmitters for rebroadcast in
   the conventional mode; a somewhat larger satellite in the communi-
   ty mode, which would broadcast to moderate size receivers located
   in village squares, or in remote areas and connected to a cable disfri-
   bution system for redistribution of the program material to viewing
   sets; and. . .direct broadcast mode, in which multi-kilowatt power
   level satellites broadcast directly to the user, who may have a con-
   ventional TV receiver. This application has the potential of provid-
   ing instant national service where there is no ground infrastructure,
   and is much talked about now for educational purposes.â€ (Testimo-

       Jesse L. Mitchell, Director of Physics and Astronomy Programs,
    OSSA, said in submitted statement that research with instrumented
    aircraft was integral part of NASA program. â€œThis research helps to
    bridge the gap between groundbased experiments and those that
    require the more expensive rockets and space vehicles. We have
    conducted auroral and airglow research observations of the solar
    corona during total eclipses and infrared observations. The ability to
    investigate interstellar dust and other celestial objects by observing
    their infrared emissions is opening up a promising line of research. A
    small jet aircraft has been used to take a 12-inch [305-mm] infrared
    telescope to 50000 feet [15 200 m] above the earth. At this altitude,
    much of the infrared radiation from the universe is observable; in
    contrast, at the surface of the earth it is obscured by water vapor.
    Investigators from the University of Arizona have used a Lear jet
    from ARC for observations of planets, stars, and galaxies at wave-
    lengths from 30 to 300 microns.â€ They had discovered centers of
    galaxies were bright in infrared. Because of importance of this area
    of astronomy, â€œ36-inch [914-mm] telescope is presently being con-
    structed to be placed in a C-141 jet airplane. This plane and the larg-
    er telescope will constitute a unique and effective airborne astro-

     objective of V/STOL program was â€œresearch needed for the develop-
     ment of advanced rotorcraft which will offer hovering capability and
     low-noise operations for inner-city operations plus the cruise flight
     efficiency necessary for inner-city to outlying airport service. Expe-
     rience with conventional helicopters shows that this service is de-
     sired but that it falls short of economic success. If the gap can be
     closed by improved technology, then the way will be clear for rapid
     development of this type of travel service. To this end, we are work-

   flows, which should contribute to detection and avoidance of clear-
   air turbulence by jet aircraft. First steps had been taken to apply
   fluid physics knowledge to atmospheric pollution from airborne and
   ground sources, testing pollutant action in models of city streets.
   New research programs would apply knowledge of fluid dynamics
   to noise abatement studies. Establishment of direct relationship
   between surface structure and electrical characteristics of germa-
   nium surface during oxidation had increased knowledge of oxygenâ€™s
   role in device performance and should increase efficiency in elec-
   tronic devices. Special attention was being given to evaluation of
   alloys at the high temperatures of supersonic speeds and to evalua-
   tion of rigid polymeric foams as lightweight structural materials for
   aircraft . (Testimony)

   Gerald M. Truszynski testified before House Committee: Tracking
   networks had supported 101 manned and unmanned missions in ad-
   dition to Apollo 11 in 1969. Meeting basic requirements of flight pro-
   jects when budget was at â€œminimum levelâ€ had required significant
   reductions in overall network capability. Planned improvements had
   been deferred in FY 1969 for second year and, for first time, sustain-
   ing equipment items had been deferred.
        FY 1971 request of $299.3 million-$298.0 million for R&D and
   $1.3 million for construction-included MSFN equipment to support
   Apollo Applications program while continuing ALSEP support. Satel-
    lite Network reductions in FY 1969 had terminated or greatly re-
   duced support of several in-orbit spacecraft still capable of trans-
    mitting valuable scientific data. Remaining workload of some 45 sat-
   elliteslcontinued to require around-the-clock bperationsjat lmostlnet-
    work stations. Many satellites already aloft would require support in
    FY 1971, as would 10 new spacecraft scheduled for launch. FY 1971
    equipment replacement program was critical. Network could sup-
    port only portion of spacecraft passes and rel!abihty was essential.

0 Science published report of Apollo 12 Lunar Sample Preliminary
    Examination Team. Samples from Ocean of Storms were about one
    billion years younger than Apollo 1 1 samples from Tranquility Base.
    While most conclusions reached on Apollo 11 rocks also applied to
    Apollo 12 rocks, Apollo 11 crystalline rocks displayed one texture
    (lath-shaped ilmenite and plagioclase with interstitial pyroxene)
    and similar modes (50% pyroxene, 30% plagioclase, 20% opaque, 0
    to 5% olivine), while Apollo 12crystalline rocks showed wide range
    in texture and mode. Most Apollo 12 igneous rocks fitted fractional
    crystallization sequence, indicating that they represented either
    parts of single intrusive sequence or samples of number of similar
    sequences. Breccias were of lower abundance at Ocean of Storms
    site than at Tranquility Base, â€œpresumably because the regolith at
    the Ocean of Storms is less mature and not as thick as at Tranquility
    Base.â€ Complex stratification existed in lunar regolith, â€œpresuma-
    bly due mainly to the superposition of ejecta blankets.â€ Apollo 12
    sample 12033 indicated presence of layer of volcanic ash. Greater
    carbon content in Apollo 12 breccias and fines than in crystalline
    rocks was â€œpresumably due largely to contributions of meteoritic
    material and solar wind.â€ Amount of indigenous organic material
    capable of volatilization or pyrolysis, or both, appeared extremely
    low in Apollo 12 samples. Content of noble gas of solar wind origin
    was less in fines and breccias of Apollo 12 rocks than in fines and
    breccias from Apollo 11â€™s Tranquility Base site. Breccias contained
    less solar wind contribution than did fines, indicating that breccias
    were formed from fines lower in solar wind noble gases than were
    fines at surface. Presence of nuclides produced by cosmic rays

    long ago, before Earthâ€™s problems of overpopulation, overconsump-

March 7: President Nixon issued statement from Key Biscayne, Fla., on
    future of U.S. space program: â€œHaving completed that long stride
    into the future which has been our objective for the past decade, we
    must now define new goals which make sense for the seventies. We

   must build on the successes of the past, always reaching out for new
   achievements. But we must also recognize that many critical prob-
   lems here on this planet make high priority demands on our atten-
   tion and our resources. By no means should we allow our space pro-
   gram to stagnate. But-with the entire future and the entire universe
   before us-we should not try to do everything at once. Our ap-
   proach to space must continue to be bold-but it must also be bal-
   anced.â€
      General purposes of space program should be exploration, ac-
   quisition of scientific knowledge, and use of practical applications to
   benefit life on earth. Six objectives of space program should be lu-
   nar exploration; planetary exploration, including eventual manned
   Mars exploration; reduction in cost of space operations; extension
   of manâ€™s capability to live and work in space; expansion of practical
   applications of space technology; and encouragement of greater in-
   ternational cooperation in space. â€œA program which achieves these
   goals will be a balanced space program. . .which will extend our
   capabilities and knowledge. . .and put our new learning to work for
   the immediate benefit of all people. As we enter a new decade, we
   are conscious. . .that man is also entering a new historic era. For the
   first time, he has reached beyond his planet; for the rest of time, we
   will think of ourselves as men from the planet Earth.â€
      President Nixon said NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine,
   had met recently with space authorities of Western Europe, Cana-
   da, Japan, and Australia to â€œfind ways in which we can cooperate
   more effectively in space.â€ (PD, 3/9/70,328-31)
  Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, at Key Biscayne press
   conference following release of Presidentâ€™s space message outlined
    NASA plans for â€œGrand Tourâ€ missions in 1970s and space develop-
   ments for next decade: â€œA strong effort in exploration, in science
   and in the practical application of space for the benefit of man here
   on Earth is laid out, with increasing emphasis on international coop-
   eration.â€ Space shuttle and space station proposals contained re-
   duction in cost of space activities and increase in manâ€™s capability to
   travel back and forth and to work in space for long periods. Space
    shuttle would take off vertically; at 64-km (40-mi) altitude and
    11 300 km per hr (7000 mph), 2nd stage would separate and carry
   22.5-metric-ton (25-short-ton) payload of men, equipment, and sup-
   plies into earth orbit, with 1st stage returning to earth for horizontal
    landing. After mission of up to two weeks, 2nd stage would reenter
   atmosphere and land horizontally for reuse.
       Presidentâ€™s program of planetary exploration would â€œprovide
    man with a closehand look of every planet in the solar system.â€
       Administration placed â€œgreat emphasis. . .on the practical appli-
    cations of space techniques, not only in communication satellites
    and weather satellites, but in new areas such as Earth resources sat-
    ellites.â€
       Dr. Paine saw as â€œmost statesmanlike portionâ€ of Presidentâ€™s
    statement â€œincreasing recognition of the international participation
    of other nations in both the exploration and the utilization of
    space.â€™â€™ It was too early to report specific results of Dr. Paineâ€™s visit
    to worldâ€™s space capitals but â€œthere certainly is a very substantial
    interest overseas in utilizing more fully the American program as a

      means of closing the technology gap on the part of other nations
      and, at the same time, allowing them to participate in both the explo-
      ration and the utilization of space in the decades to come.â€ (Tran-

      mountains 48 km (30 mi) southwest of San Carlos Yautepec, Mexi-
      co, showed more detail of solar corona than any picture ever taken,
      Center said. Dr. Newkirk used special filter installed on white-light

    In NASA-sponsored solar eclipse project .scientists used spacecraft in
0
      deep space, earth-orbiting satellltes, instruments on ground, and
      sounding rockets to make intense study, concentrating on eclipseâ€™s
      effect on earthâ€™s atmosphere and ionosphere.
         In-space observations were conducted with four NASA spacecraft
      and three U.S.-Canada satellites. Radio signals from Mariner VI on
      far side of sun were measured to determine how eclipse affected
      signals and to study changes in charged particles in earthâ€™s atmos-
      phere. Os0 V and Os0 VI, in earth orbit, pointed instruments at sun
      to gather data on sun and solar atmosphere, and Ats III photo-
      graphed earth and its cloud-cover to show path of eclipse across
      northern hemisphere. American-Canadian satellites AIouette I ,
      Alouette 11, and Isis I investigated eclipse-caused changes in ionos-
      phere.
         Ground observations were conducted by observers from three
      universities and four NASA centers at sites in Virginia and Mexico.
      At site near Sandbridge, Va. ,. Univ. of Michigan team photographed
      solar corona and LaRC experimenter photographed solar flash spec-
      trum that was too weak to be seen when sun was not obscured. La-
       RC, GSFC, and SAO scientists used four Super Schmidt Meteor Cam-
      eras at Wallops Island, Eastville, and Sandbridge, Va., to photo-
      graph faint comets believed to be near sun. At LaRC, Univ. of Colo-
      rado scientists used optical assembly for two Wallaston prisms on
       LaRCâ€™S 241-mm (9.5-in) Cassegrain telescope to investigate differ-
      ence between color of tangentially and radially polarized radiation
       from solar K-corona. ARC scientists photographed full intermediate-
       scale coronal structure, using special radial transmission filter in
       front of LaRC telescopeâ€™s prime focus.
          In Mexico LaRC scientists used NASAâ€™S mobile Satellite Photo-
       metric Observatory in path of totality at Miahuatlan to determine
       intensity of coronal radiation to 1% accuracy. Simultaneous wide-
       band monitor measurements of intensity and polarization of coronal
       radiation were made out to 3.2 million km (2 million mi) from sun to
       determine for first time fine structure of coronal electron density
       and temperature. Team of MSC and Univ. of Houston scientists
       made variety of observations near Miahuatlan in attempt to separate
       F- and K-coronas, determine structure .of coronas, and study inter-
       planetary dust and particles by measuring coronal intensity and ra-
       diation, recording flash chromosphere spectrum, and using photo-
       graphic and photoelectric techniques to study shadow bands.

    AFCRL KC-135 research aircraft, carrying new infrared sensing system

     and multichannel tape recorders above moonâ€™s shadow, collected
     data on solar eclipse. Primary objective was to develop techniques
     for predicting wavelengths at which atmosphere would be most
     transparent under different conditions. Although eclipse lasted only
     3 min 30 secs on earth, by chasing lunar shadow scientists prolonged
     effect to 5 min 38 secs. Abrupt switching off and switching on of
     sunlight provided ideal means of learning nature of airglow reaction,
     particularly in 80- to 100-km (50- to 60-mi) region. Aircraft flew from
      Kelly AFB, Tex., down eclipse path over Pacific four times-before
      eclipse, as sun became increasingly covered, during eclipse totality,
      and during final stages of partial eclipse. (Sullivan, NYT, 3/8/70,60)

    Press editorials commented on President Nixonâ€™s statement on Na-
      tionâ€™s space program.
         New York Times: â€œIf the Presidentâ€™s program is fulfilled on
      schedule, the economics of space activity-both its costs and its
      dividends for nonscientists here on earth-will be revolutionized.
      The reconnaissance activities of earth resources satellites have
      enormous potentials for aiding agriculture, forestry, the search for
      new minerals, and the exploitation of the seas. The prospect of
      communications satellites that can broadcast radio and television
      programs directly to homes everywhere offers exciting new
      perspectives for further unifying all peoples, while simultaneously
      raising delicate political problems. . . . When it becomes available,
      the reusable space shuttle will. . .facilitate construction of a perma-
      nent manned orbiting space station that will open up new areas of
      scientific and economic activity in the near neighborhood of earth.â€™â€™
      (NYT, 3/9/70)
         Washington Evening Star: â€œThe 1970â€™s promise to be an exciting
      decade in space, not just a comedown from the exhilaration of the
      initial moon landings. The next 10 years will be even more satisfying
      if another of the Presidentâ€™s goals-increased international coopera-
      tion in space-is realized. To that end, Soviet space scientists have
      been told about the U.S. plans. The Russian leaders would do well
      to consider the economies and other benefits that could come from
      pooling skills and resources as man reaches farther and farther be-
      yond his planet.â€ (W Star, 3/9/70)
          Washington Post: â€œIt was appropriate that President Nixon
      should announce his proposed plans for exploration in space on the
      last day in this century when a total eclipse of the sun was visible in
      the United States. Opportunities to make strides in learning about
      our universe do not come often and must be seized when they ar-
      rive. The scientists. . .did the best that could be done in Saturdayâ€™s
      brief moment of darkness to learn more about the forces in the sun
      that dominate our solar system. And the President seems to have
      done about the best that can be done with the resources now availa-
      ble to keep our space program on the rieht track.

      grand tours of our outermost planets are the most exciting-will test
      the willingness of the nation to spend huge sums on basic research.
      The future programs of NASA, at least for the next decade, will have
      little of the appeal that seized the ublic during the race to land men
      on the moon first. And the wort hp of these programs, in terms of
      knowledge they may yield about the solar system and the usefulness
      of that knowledge, is difficult to appreciate fully. The test in the fu-
      ture will be whether we are willing to pay for these robes for knowl-
      edge without the exhilarating experience of watcfing the first man
      step onto the moonâ€™s surface, and of beating the Russians.â€ ( W

e â€œGrand Tourâ€™â€™ of outer solar system was discussed by William Hines
   in Chicago Sun-Times: â€œThe grand tour idea came out of Caltech
   several years ago after a graduate student in Prof. Homer J. Stew-
   artâ€™s aeronautical engineering department calculated the added en-
   ergy that could be imparted to a spacecraft by the massive gravita-
   tional fields of various planets. This information, together with the
   unusual configuration of outer planets in the 1980s, was patched
   together by Stewart into the grand tour concept. Theoretically,
   Stewart calculated, it should be possible to fire a spacecraft into a
   near-miss trajectory toward Jupiter and then let that planet, biggest
   in the solar system, take over. Jupiter would add energy, and hence
   velocity, to the spacecraft.. . . This would send the craft toward
   Saturn, where more energy would be borrowed from the ringed
   planetâ€™s gravitational field, and then on to Uranus for more of the
   same, Neptune and finally Pluto.â€ ( C Sun-Times, 3/9/70)

March I f : MSC scientists reported three kinds of earth bacteria had died
   when exposed to lunar soil gathered by Apollo If: staphylococcus
   aureus scraped from Apollo 21 astronauts when they returned to
   earth; azobacter vinlandii, solid bacterium; and pseuodomonas
   aeroginosa, used in laboratory studies. LRL chief of preventative
   medicine Dr. William Kemmerer said conjecture was that all were
   killed by poison in Apollo I 1 core-tube material. Tube held lunar soil
   gathered from five to eight inches beneath lunar surface. There had
   been no ill effects in similar tests with Apollo 11 soil or Apollo 12
   surface or underground samples. (Cohn, W Post, 3/12/70, Al)
0 Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, reported on international
   cooperation in NASA programs before Senate Committee on Aer-
   onautical and Space Sciences: NASA had established â€œsound base
   of extensive and successful cooperationâ€ with over 70 countries in
   1960s, entered into almost 250 agreements for international space
   projects, orbited foreign satellites and flown foreign experiments on
   U.S. spacecraft, participated in more than 500 cooperative scientific
   rocket soundings from sites throughout world, involved more than
   50 foreign scientists in analysis of lunar samples, and provided for
   direct daily reception by some 50 countries of data from weather
   satellites. â€œThirdâ€ countries together spent â€œroughly $300 million a
   year on space.â€
      â€œOn the aeronautics side of NASAâ€™s responsibilities, cooperative
   projects with Canadian, French, German, and British agencies are
   contributing importantly to the development and testing of a variety
   of V/STOL aircraft configurations.â€™â€™
      In experimental meteorological satellite and balloon program,
   Project Eole, NASA would launch French satellite to track several
   hundred balloons to derive global circulation of winds. Cooperative
   earth resources survey projects had been undertaken with Brazil and
   Mexico to acquaint foreign scientists and policy makers with poten-
   tial of remote sensing. NASA had added earth resources disciplines
   to international graduate fellowship program and planned interna-
   tional workshop in 1971. NASA was providing technical assistance to
   India in aircraft survey of coconut palm blight in Kerala State so
   that its spread could be controlled. Agency was considering propos-
   al to launch French synchronous meteorological satellite as joint
   contribution to Global Atmospheric Research Program and had met
   informally with ESRO and European aviation officials to consider
   mission requirements for possible preoperational air-traffic-control
   satellite system for North Atlantic.

    Kansas City Times editorial commented on President Nixonâ€™s space
      recommendations: â€œThe hang-the-cost generosity of Congress that
      marked the early years of the Apollo moon program seems not to
      have been rekindled by last summerâ€™s landing on the Sea of Tran-
      quility, for all the justified national pride that feat stimulated. And
      Mr. Nixon, judging from his last budget message, is disinclined to
      buck this trend. The Presidentâ€™s conviction seems to be that impor-
      tant and dramatic goals await the U.S. in space, but that the reality
      of competing demands on the national resources prohibits the set-
      ting of binding deadlines for their achievement. His caution is rea-
      sonable, even if it does not lend itself to flights of public imagina-

      Robert C . Seamans, Jr:, Secretary of the Air Force, before Senate
      Armed Services Committee during hearings on USAF FY 1971 budg-
      et request: In 1969 it had appeared â€œthat the 120 aircraft program
      would cost about $4,831 million, including initial spares. As we in-
      terpreted the contract, the contractor would lose some $285 million
      on 120 aircraft, and any smaller buy the contractorâ€™s loss would be
      higher. The contractor disagreed. By his interpretation. . .he expect-
      ed to make a small profit on the total program. As a consequence of
      budget restraints, rising costs, and an overall reappraisal of defense
      requirements, we have now limited the program to 81 aircraft. The
      programâ€™s final cost to the Government, however, depends on reso-
      lution of the issues between the Air Force and contractor over the
      contract. We are still trying to work these out with Lockheed

     ence and technology; explore solar system with phased program of
     lunar exploration, search for extraterrestrial life, and diversified
     planetary exploration; and use space platforms to expand
     knowledge of universe and basic physical laws. Panel urged that
     U.S. develop technology to expand capability for automated equip-
     ment controlled by man in remote location for space exploration and
     civil applications, reduce cost of space operations by cost reduction
     for expendable vehicles and payload development, strengthen
     biomedical basis for possible long-duration manned space flights,
     and encourage international cooperative programs.
        Panel recommended NASA and DOD continue joint study of reusa-
     ble space transportation system â€œin the expectation that a decision
     can be made for a FY 1972 budget decision on an STS development
     program .â€ Design target should be replacement â€œof the largest pos-

    Director of Medical Research and Operations, Dr. Charles A. Ber-
    ry, and his staff â€œhave been responsible for establishing medical
   protocols for the missions, in a way that balances the need for bi-
    omedical data with operational demands and the willingness and
    ability of the astronauts to cooperate. Some medical procedures are
   tedious, unpleasant, and even humiliating, and when the work load
    on astronauts is heavy, data gathering has to be limited. For this
    reason in part, then, tension between biomedical insiders and out-
    siders is likely to continue. At the same time the interests of the two
    groups are nearer to converging than ever before.â€ (Walsh, Sci-

    Lovell announced final code names for LM and CM had been selected
    according to theme of mythology. LM would be called â€œAquariusâ€
    after mythical Egyptian water carrier who brought fertility and
    knowledge to Nile Valley. Code name originally selected for CM-
    â€œAuriga,â€ for constellation Auriga-had been dropped in favor of

    ings of Odysseus in Greek mythology. Lovell said Apollo 13 crew
    had â€œalready had quite an odyssey just getting trainedâ€ for mission.
       Landing of Aquarius on moon would be different from previous
    landings, Lovell said. Key to landing was Cone Crater on Fra Mau-
    ro. LM was â€œbeing targeted for a spot that we donâ€™t want to land at,â€
    uprange about 1/2 km from desired site; â€œweâ€™re not sure of the ac-
    tual height of this ridge [of Cone Crater]. . .so weâ€™re targeting
    uprange to make sure we get over it.â€

   hearing on S.R. 49, providing for Congressional recognition of God-
   dard Rocket and Space Museum at Roswell, N. Mex., as fitting
   memorial to Dr. Robert H. Goddard, U.S. rocket pioneer. Dr.
   Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, testified: â€œAmericans can
    ill afford to ignore the contributions of Robert H. Goddard in the
   history of the coming of the space age. Young Americans need to
   appreciate that what appear as unsoluble problems today are not
    new to manâ€™s experience. Dr. Robert H. Goddardâ€™s rocket artifacts
    and his lifelong labors should be an inspiration to each generation of
    youth as they grapple with their concerns of their day and their
    dreams of a better world of their tomorrows in a dynamic universe.
   This nation cannot afford not to have Robert H. Goddards in the
   future .â€
        Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator,
    testified: â€œIt seems very important that we and our children after us
    never lose awareness of what key individuals such as Robert God-
    dard provided to a fuller understanding of the progress of mankind.
    He, like Konstantine Tsiolkovsky of Russia and Hermann Oberth of
    Germany, correctly theorized on the use of liquid hydrogen as a fuel
    with liquid oxygen for high-energy thrust. Based upon the liquid-
    hydrogen work at the Lewis Research Center, NASA developed the
    upper stages for the Saturn V which enabled us to achieve the Apol-
    lo missions to the moon.â€™â€™

     launchers.â€ Soviets had technology to develop hard-target MIRVand
     â€œFractional Orbit Bombardment (FOBS) or depressed trajectory
     ICBM (DICBM) may already be operational. Their new â€˜swing-wingâ€™

     of our bombers with the Short Range Attack Missile (SRAM) and the
     Subsonic Cruise Armed Decoy (SCAD) and providing for increased
     prelaunch survivability through satellite basing and improved warn-
     ing.â€ In last five years, â€œwe have cut our active interceptor strength

   around the severe limitations placed on the size of the radiating ob-
   ject and may help account for the random variability observed in the
   emission of many extragalactic objects. Second, the idea that many

March 21: Theory that helped to explain source of uncontrolled malig-

   countermeasures against cancer was described by L a w biophysi-
   cist Clarence D. Cone, Jr., at 12th Annual Science Writers Seminar
   of American Cancer Society in San Antonio, Tex. Theory proposed
   that division of body cells was controlled precisely by pattern of ion
   concentrations on surface tissue of cells. Pattern was formed by
   electrical voltage that normally existed across cellular surfaces and
   varied from one part of body to another. Theory provided explana-
   tion of functional connection between two major pathological fea-
   tures of cancer-uncontrolled growth of cells and spread of disease
   in body-and implied that basic functional aberrancy producing
   both conditions lay in alteration of molecular structure of cell sur-
   face. Theory proposed central mechanism for control of body cell
   division, which, if proved valid, would provide new basis for re-
   search progress on key biomedical problems, such as human con-
   ception, birth defects, growth, aging, and cancer. (Text; NASA Re-

     ty Associate Administrator for Planning, Dr. Wernher von Braun
     held press conference on NASA planning procedures: Skylab pro-
     gram would consist of four flights. First would be an unmanned
     flight boosted by two-stage Saturn V-only first and second stage,
     with third stage replaced by orbital workshop, now called Skylab.
        â€œIt will be this countryâ€™s first orbital space station. Attached to
     this Skylab is an airlock module, and a multiple docking adapter, to
     which arriving command and service modules can dock for crew
     exchange. And also attached to it is the ATM. . .a manned solar ob-
     servatory that will be serviced by the people living in the Skylab.
     One day after this Skylab has been launched into orbit and has de-
     pioyed its solar panels, both on the ATM and the Skylab itself, it will
     be visited by a Saturn 1B-launched command and service module,
     bringing the first crew complement of three. The command module
     will dock to the multiple docking adapter, the crew will slip through
     the docking adapter and the airlock, into the workshop. . . . And the
     men will stay up there for 28 days.â€ Crew would then â€œcrawl back
     into their command module, detach.. .use the service module to

    deboost themselves, and the command module will reenter the
    ocean and make a norma4 Apollo landing.
       â€œAbout three months after the first flight, another flight will go up,
    and this time the crew stay.. .will be extended to 56 days. . . . And
    finally, there will be a third revisit, again of 56 days, after which the
    third crew will descend. The Skylab will then go into storage and
    can potentially be reactivated any time thereafter if more revisits
    are planned.â€
       Even without budget restraints, it would be â€œsomething like 1977
    before we could have a [space] shuttle flying.â€

During March: Dr. James A. Van Allen, Univ. of Iowa Director of Phys-
    ics and Astronomy Depts.., discussed significance of lunar landings,
    in university lecture ser~es: â€œThe Apollo missions, to me, are
    straightforward though immensely difficult tasks. They do, howev-
    er, yield relatively little in the way of fundamental understanding of
    nature. They are not scientific in that sense. There is a longstanding
    controversy as to whether a manned spacecraft is a better way to
    conduct science in space than an automated, commandable space-
    craft. Iâ€™m sure there is no simple answer to that question. As the
    general romance and entertainment value of manned flight tend to
    wear off a little, I think this question will be attacked in a thoroughly
    pragmatic way.â€ Apollo 1 1 lunar landing â€œmight properly be com-
    pared to the explorations of Amundsen and Perry and Byrd in the
    Arctic and Antarctic, or perhaps Lindbergh flying the Atlantic. These

   are great achievements, heroic achievements, but the general poten-
   tial af the Moon in its relationship to human life on a large scale is by
    no means obvious to me. I donâ€™t think any competent person has
   foanda significant, economic, human use for the Moon.â€ There was
   general feeling, mostly from aeronautics and allied industries, that
    development- of space flight was important to U.S. future in same
    sense that aircraft development had been. â€œI think this is fundamen-
   taly a false analogy.â€ Space shuttle and space station were feasible.
    â€œWhether or not it is sensible to pursue them, I have a great difficul-
   ty iin judging.â€ (Univ of Iowa Spectator, 3/70,6)
* AIA President Karl G. Harr, Jr., said in Aerospace Technology: â€œIn
    terms of its scope and novelty no single enterprise matches manâ€™s
    landing on the moon-the Apollo program. Nor has any other enter-
    prisein history brokem so much new technical ground. The technical
    and mmageriaI ingredients of these space accomplishments, as we11
    as of comparable national security programs, are available for
    brmder applications in the nationâ€™s service. The problem is how to
    harness them effectively for such purposes. The Apollo program
    eenfered on a clearry stated goal with adequate funding for its attain-
    ment. Because it represented achievement of a national goal, lines
    o authority and responsibility were clear, simple and strong. Our
      f
    nationâ€™s environmental problems, however, often do not enjoy such
    clear delineations. . . . The greatest need is for the development of
    innovative means to overcome such constraints so that technologyâ€™s
    FevoMionary new tools can be more effectively applied to the press-
    ing needs of our society. . . . The transfer of aerospace technology
    to domestic areas is underway and is already making significant con-

    Satellite), worldâ€™s first weather satellite, launched by NASA from
    Cape Canaveral, Fla. Satellite had transmitted 22 952 pictures dur-
   ing 89-day lifetime. Since Tiros I , 23 meteorological satellites-I0
   Tiros, 3 Nimbus, 9 ESSA. and 1 ITos-had been orbited, returning

  Space shuttle mission capabilities were described by LeRoy E. Day,
   Manager of Space Shuttle Task Group in NASA OMSF. in paper pre-
   sented at AIAA conference on Test Effectiveness in the 70s at Palo
   Alto, Calif.: â€œIt is envisioned that the shuttle will eventually rep!ace
   essentially all of the present day launch vehicles or their derivatives
   except for very small vehicles of the Scout class and the Saturn V.
   This will be possible because low operational costs of the reusable
   shuttle will make it competitive even if it carries only a fraction of
   its full payload capability on particular missions. In addition to the
    low launch costs, we expect the benign acoustic and acceleration
   environment of the shuttle to allow significant reductions in the cost
   of payloads. Acceleration during descent and reentry will be less
                                                       r
   than 3 gâ€™s. Payload design will be further aided b allowing greater
    volume and weight for many payloads because o the shuttle cargo
    bay accommodations. Preliminary analyses indicate reductions in
    payload development costs of 25-30 percent may be expected.â€

    tion-one so cramped as to allow little room for maneuvering-that
    future research funds must be considered. The Presidentâ€™s budget
    for 1971 calls for $15.8 billion of R&D funds, an amount which con-
    stitutes a smaller percentage of the total federal budget than in any
    year since 1959. Research and development funds hit a high of 12.6
    percent of the federal budget in 1965 and have been decreasing by
    an average rate of 0.8 percentage point a year, to 8.7 percent in 1970

   where it would investigate new technique for accurate, real-time
   determination of positions on earth's surface.
        Primary objectives for Nimbus IVwere to acquire sufficient num-
   ber of global samples of atmospheric radiation measurements for
   comparing vertical-temperature, water-vapor, and ozone profiles
    and to provide basis for comparing merits of at least three of five
    spectrometric experiments on board. As secondary objectives

    (backscatter uv spectrometer, filter wedge spectrometer, and selec-
    tive chopper radiometer) and six carried on previous Nimbus mis-

    trometer; interrogation, recording, and location system; tempera-
   ture and humidity infrared radiometer; image-dissector camera sys-
    tem; and monitor of uv solar energy). Spacecraft's new attitude-

    Haise, Jr., and Mattingly-had been tested for immunity to German
    measles April 6 after exposure to disease and Mattingly had not
    shown immunity. NASA said final decision on moving Swigert to

    Dr. Malcolm Smith, Jr., was published by New York Times. In-
    creased use of spoons, use of bowls, and facilities for spreading
    sandwich fillings on slices of fresh bread would provide Apollo 13
    astronauts more nearly normal eating procedures than on previous
    missions. Freeze-dried pork and scalloped potatoes would contain
    chunks rather than be of baby food consistency but meal would still
    be lukewarm. Wider variety of fresh bread had been baked for
    Apollo 13 mission, in lidded pans to provide uniform crust as insur-
    ance against loose crumbs which had been problem with former
    freeze-dried cracker sandwiches. Loaves were passed through 1900
    K (3000Â°F) flame to destroy all mold-producing spores. Two slices
    of bread made from irradiated flour would be carried to test poten-
    tial alternate method of preserving food without refrigeration. Apol-
    lo 13â€™s food was 70% freeze-dried, mainly because of space limita-
    tion; bread was treated with nitrogen gas to retard staling. Other
     â€œfirstsâ€ in foods to be carried were pecans to stimulate astronautsâ€™
    appetites, dehydrated orange crystals modified to prevent caking,
    and instant rice product to be reconstituted by hot tap water.
        Dr. Smith was already planning for 120-day Skylab missions,

   mission, but 56 hrs into flight toward moon mission was aborted
   because of SM oxygen tank rupture. In most serious inflight situation
   experienced in manned space program, crew followed LM â€œlife-
   boatâ€ emergency plan, transferring to LM and using its systems and
   supplies to swing around moon and back to earth on fastest feasible
   course. Emergency procedures were used to make electrical power,
   water, and oxygen last to end of journey. Crew returned to CM and
   jettisoned LM before reentry and splashed down safely in Pacific
   April 17.
       April 11-12: Mission began with successful, on-schedule liftoff
   from KSC Launch Complex 39, Pad A, at 2:13 pm EST April 11,
   carrying Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr. (commander), John L.
   Swigert, Jr. (CM pilot), and Fred W. Haise, Jr. (LM pilot). Swigert
   was last-minute substitution from backup crew for Thomas K. Mat-
   tingly 11, who had failed to develop immunity after exposure to
   German measles. Launch was watched by 4500 persons in VIP
   stands. Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, West German Chancellor
   Willy Brandt, and Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator,
   watched from KSC firing Room No. 1. Weather conditions at launch
   were satisfactory: peak ground winds of 10 knots, overcast at 6000
   m (20 000 ft), and visibility of 16 km (10 mi).
       Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with
    185.5-km (1 15.3-mi) apogee and 181.5-km (1 12.8-mi) perigee. During
   2nd-stage boost S-I1 center engine cut off 132 secs early and remain-
   ing four engines burned 34 secs longer than predicted. Space vehicle
   velocity after boost was 68 m per sec (223 fps) lower than planned,
   causing S-IVB orbital insertion burn to be 9 secs longer than predict-
   ed, but sufficient propellants remained for translunar insertion.
   Onboard TV was initiated at 1:35 GET for 5 1/2 min. Second S-IVB
   burn, on schedule at 2:41 GET, injected spacecraft on translunar
   trajectory.
       CSM separated from S-IVB and LM Aquarius. Onboard TV initiat-
   ed after separation for 72 min clearly showed CSM â€œhard-dockingâ€
    with L M , ejection of CSM/LM from S-IVB/IU at 4:Ol GET, S-IVB aux-
    iliary propulsion system (APS) evasive maneuver, and spacecraft
    exterior and interior.
       First S-IVB APS burn, lasting 217 secs beginning at 6:OO GET,
    aimed stage for lunar target point so accurately that second burn
    was not required. S-IVB/IU hit lunar surface at 7757 GET (8: 10 pm
    EST April 14) at 259 m per sec (8465 fps) and energy equivalent to
    11.5 tons of TNT at 2.4â€ south latitude and 27.9â€ west longitude-
    137.1 km (85.2 mi) from Apollo 12 seismometer that detected im-

     12 LM Zntrepid that had impacted moonNov. 20,1969, but was 20-30
    times larger and lasted 3 hrs 20 mins-four times longer. Signal was
    so large that ground command had to reduce seismometer gain to
    keep recording on scale. Suprathermal ion detector experiment
    (SIDE) deployed by Apollo 12 crew recorded jump in the number of
    ion counts after S-IVB/IU impact. Instrument, in lunar shadow,

      Translunar insertion maneuver was so accurate that midcourse
   correction No. 1 (MCC-1) was not necessary. MCC-2, for 3.4 secs at
   30: 14 GET, placed spacecraft on desired hybrid circumlunar trajecto-
   ry with closest approach of 114.9 km (71.4 mi). MCC-3 was not nec-
   essary. Good-quality TV coverage of preparations for and perform-

      While joking with Mission Control, Swigert suddenly remem-
   bered that he had failed to file his Federal income tax return, but
   was assured that he could be granted an extension.
      April 13-14: Lovell and Hake entered L M for housekeeping and
   system checks, reported that helium tank that had malfunctioned
   before launch was satisfactory, transmitted TV pictures of LM inte-
   rior, and joked about sleeping and eating in space. Haise reported he
   had shaved to improve his TV image. Lovell closed telecast by
   wishing everyone on earth â€œa nice evening,â€ saying astronauts were
   ready â€œto get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey.â€™â€™ Minutes lat-
   er, at 5 5 5 5 GET (10:08 pm EST April 13), crew reported undervoltage
   alarm on CSM main bus B, rapid loss of pressure in SM oxygen tank
   No. 2, and dropping of current in fuel cells 1 and 3 to zero.
      â€œHey, weâ€™ve got a problem here,â€ Swigert told ground control-
   lers.
      â€œThis is Houston, say again please.â€
      â€œHouston, weâ€™ve had a problem,â€ Lovell replied. And Haise
   reported â€œa pretty large bang associated with the caution and warn-
   ing.â€
      A few minutes later crew reported spacecraft was venting some-
   thing-later determined to be oxygen-out into space. Astronauts
   could see blizzard of particles flying out of SM, presumably from
   ruptured tank. Despite desperate efforts improvised on board and
   suggested by Mission Control, nothing seemed to halt drop in oxy-
   gen pressure. Spacecraft dipped repeatedly, apparently because of
   venting gas. By 57:24 GET, Mission Control reported tank No. 2
   pressure was â€œslowly going to zero and weâ€™re starting to think about
   the LM lifeboat.â€ Swigert replied, â€œYes, thatâ€™s something weâ€™re
   thinking about, too. Weâ€™ve been talking it over. . . .â€ Decision was
   made to abort mission.
      Astronauts hurriedly had to salvage enough oxygen to supply CM
   during reentry and keep gyros operating until LM navigation equip-
   ment could be powered up. With only minutes of power remaining,
   crew fed oxygen into reserve tank and hooked up emergency batter-
   ies to CSM navigation gyros until LM was powered up. Crew activat-

   support.

     mission-including details of accident and emergency procedures-
     were made public immediately as data were received. Publicâ€™s ap-
     parent boredom at beginning of mission was transformed into deep
     concern for astronautsâ€™ safety. Messages and offers of aid were sent
     to U.S. from world leaders and prayers were offered by religious
     leaders on every continent.
       MCC-4 was conducted with LMâ€™S descent propulsion system (DPS)
     at 61:30 GET, placing Apollo 13 on free-return trajectory around
     moon on which CM Odyssey would splash down in Indian Ocean at
     152:OO GET. Both LM guidance systems were powered up and prima-
     ry system used for 263.4-sec DPS burn at 79:28 GET as spacecraft
     swung out from behind moon, two hours after closest approach.
     Burn produced 262-m-per-see (860 fps) differential velocity, short-
     ened predicted return time to 14353 GET, and moved predicted land-
     ing point to mid-Pacific. After maneuver, passive thermal control
     was established and LM was powered down to conserve consuma-
     bles.

        During remainder of transearth coast crew continued emergency
     procedures to deal with shortage of water to cool LM electronic sys-
     tems, decreasing temperatures in both cabins, and buildup of carbon
     dioxide in LM. Fearing that CM instruments needed for reentry might
     freeze, crew kept spacecraft in passive thermal control-â€œbarbecue
     modeâ€ of rotation to let sun uniformly heat all sides. Astronauts
     met cooling water shortage by filling every plastic bag they could
     with water from CM and carrying it to LM. Shortage of air-cleaning
     lithium hydroxide in LM was met by rigging combination of CM and
     LM cartridges; following instructions worked out on ground, crew
     built adapter and ran lunar spacesuit air hoses from LM fans through
     tunnel to connect to CM air-scrubbing canisters. Transmission of
     health data was eliminated and communications held to minimum to
     conserve electricity. Crew tried to keep warm by wearing boots car-
     ried for walking on moon, sleeping in narrow tunnel between LM and
     CSMthat seemed warmer, and wearing extra clothing.

The L M , which had served as a lifeboat after an oxygen tank explosion aborted the mis-
sion, was photographed from the CM after jettison. Industry, university, and NASA ground
teams had been working continuously during the last days of the return trip to develop new
reentry procedures for the unusual CMILM configuration.

     mal conditions. Because of unusual spacecraft configuration (with
     LM still attached) and L     inability to survive reentry heat, officials
     on ground developed n        reentry procedu       and verified them in
     ground-based simulations. A 30-man team at MITâ€™S Charles S . Drap-
     er Laboratory worked throughout night studying stressed Apollo 13
     guidance system and working out new trajectories. Simulations and
     programming of emergency problems were conducted by NR engi-
     neers in Downey, Calif., by Astronaut Richard F. Gordon, Jr., in
     LM at KSC, and by Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan and David R. Scott
     at MSC, so that almost every move Apollo 13 crew made had first
     been proved out on ground.
        MCC-7 was successfully accomplished at 137:40 GET with 22.4-
     sec LM RCS burn, resulting in predicted -6.49â€ entry-flight-path angle.
     Crew viewed and photographed SM when it was jettisoned at 138:02
     GET, reporting that one entire panel was missing near S-band high-
     gain antenna and that great deal of debris was hanging out.
        CM was powered up and .LM was jettisoned at 141:30 GET. SNAP-
     27 nuclear generator carrying 3.9 kg (8.6 Ibs) of radioactive pluto-
     nium fell from LM into Pacific northeast of New Zealand.

     sites-were not achieved. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administra-
     tor, announced April 17 that Apollo 13 Review Board, headed by
     LaRC Director Edgar M. Cortright, would be established to deter-
     mine cause of accident.
        Apollo 13 flight crew performance was outstanding throughout
     mission; calm, precise reaction to emergency and diligence in config-
      uring and maintaining LM was noteworthy. Despite lack of ade-
     quate sleep and low temperature in spacecraft, neither performance
     nor spirits faltered. Similarly, performance of flight operations team
     was outstanding in planning and aiding crew to safe return.

      ried-they have women, who like the wives and the mothers of the
      Vikings of old waited at home with faith that their men would come
      back .â€

* Editorial comment as damaged Apollo 13 attempted safe return to
   earth:
      New York Times: â€œAn emergency in a space craft on the voyage
   between earth and moon was bound to occur sometime. The enor-
    mous hazards of the long journey through the most hostile of envi-
   ronments, the ever present possibility of failure by one or more of
   the millions of components contained in an Apollo vehicle, the ubiq-
   uitous threat of human error, all these combine in lunar flights to
   make them the most dangerous expeditions human beings have ever
   undertaken. In retrospect, the remarkable fact is not that such omi-
   nous peril has arisen in the now-aborted trip of Apollo 13, but that
   the actually hazardous trips to the moon and back by Apollos 8, 10,
    11, and 12 were accomplished in safety.â€ (NYT, 4/15/70)
       Washington Post: â€œLindbergh gave up a continent, as the astro-
   nauts gave up a planet, because he had measured the risks and
    found them reasonable, for all the possibility of disaster lurking
    around the corner-it does so every day for men and nations. So if
   we are going to apply the glories, we must confront the dangers
    along the way. All we can do now, as that unlike1 looking craft

   the men in Houston who guide it can find what Lindbergh found.
    â€˜Somewhere in an unknown recess of my mind,â€™ he wrote â€˜Iâ€™ve dis-

    that confront me. What I can do depends largely on what I have to
   do to stay alive and on course.â€™ â€ (WPost, 4/15/70)
      Baltimore Sun: â€œThe safety record of the Apollo program has,
   except for one hideous ground accident, been a perfect one. Per-
   haps we have too easily assumed that therefore all expeditions
   would begin and end without serious and unforseen breakdown,
   without the torments of suspense when the line between splendid
   accomplishment and bitter tragedy is drawn very fine. The truth is,
   of course, that exploration, especially in a realm new to man, can
   never be free of deadly hazards. But the astronauts and the men
   associated with them in their ventures have always known it.â€ It
   was clear astronauts were equal to emergency, â€œbut they remain at
   the mercy of machinery which in some still unexplained way has
   failed them. The rest of us can only wait from desperate hour to
   hour, trusting that superlative skill, universal ho e and fervent pray-
   ers will prevail over cruel chance.â€ (B Sun,4/15370)

    real those dangers are. . .of the special qualities of the men who dare
    to brave the perils of space. It testifies, also, to the extraordinary
    concert of skills, in space and on the ground, that goes into a moon
    mission. To the astronauts, a relieved Nation says â€˜Welcome home.â€™
    To them and to those on the ground who did so magnificent a job of

    thanksgiving for safe return of Apollo I3 astronauts, President
    said: â€œThe imperiled flight and safe return of the crew of Apollo 13
    were events that humbled and inspired people all over the world.
    We were humbled by the knowledge that in this stage of manâ€™s ex-
    ploration of space, a safe splashdown of an imperiled mission is in
    its way as successful as a landing on and safe return from the Moon.
    We were inspired by the courage of the crew, the devotion and skill
    of the members of the NASA team on the ground and by the offers of
    assistance from nations around the world.â€

   and technical specialists. Dr. Thomas 0 . Paine, NASA Administra-
   tor, said although mission â€œmust be recorded as a failure, thereâ€™s
   never been a more prideful moment in the space program.â€ Most
   impressive aspect of mission was â€œtremendous effectiveness in
   team work of our ground support operation . . . . From every state
    . . . weâ€™ve had people. . . working to backstop-the many dd-
   ferent system decisions that had to be systematically and methodi-
   cally faced u p to and made. . . . The Flight Operations Directors
   . . . certainly demonstrated that flight controllers can operate
   under these very adverse conditions. Theyâ€™ve been able to do things
   in a far shorter period of time than weâ€™d ever thought possible be-I
   fore .â€
       Dr. George M . Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, said basic pro-
   cedures used for every phase of mission were predetermined. â€œFor
   example, the burn made behind the moon . . . was a standard emer-
   gency burn that would be used in case the service propulsion system
   would not work on a normal lunar mission going into lunar orbit.
   Each one of these steps had been predetermined and also simulated.
   But putting them all together into a sequence of steps . . . and
   working out some of the detailed procedures on how to save power
   and how to save batteries; how to save water; those things were de-
   termined during the course of the flight, both by the men . . . on the

    of motivated young talent from the physical to the life sciences, the

     Freedom to Apollo 13 astronauts. He said in part: â€œwe have re-
     ceived over 100 messages from foreign governments-from the So-
     viet Union, from Poland, other countries behind the Iron Curtain,
     from countries in the free world. This is truly a welcome from all the
     people of the world to three very brave men.â€ Citation on each
     medal read: â€œAdversity brings out the character of a man. Con-
     fronted suddenly and unexpectedly with grave peril in the far reach-
     es of space, he demonstrated a calm courage and quiet heroism that
     stand as an example to men everywhere. His safe return is a triumph
     of the human spirit-of those special qualities of man himself we
     rely on when machines fail, and that we rely on also for those things
     that machines cannot do.
        â€œFrom the start, the exploration of space has been hazardous
     adventure. The voyage of Apollo 13 dramatized its risks. The men
     of Apollo 13, by their poise and skill under the most intense kind of
     pressure, epitomized the character that accepts danger and sur-
     mounts it. Theirs is the spirit that built America. With gratitude and

   ing into the moon on schedule, and that did produce some useful and
   important scientific data. But in a larger sense, Apollo 13â€™s flight was
   enormously productive. The emergency which so gravely endan-
   gered .its crew turned this flight into a crucial-though unintended-
   experiment in space rescue . . . . The lessons learned from this
   near-disaster will help save spacefarers who are still unborn. And

9 Max Lerner described reactions to Apollo 13 accident in Philadelphia
   Evening Bulletin: â€œWhat was I doing, glued to the TV screen like a
   zombie with the blood drained out me . . .? What was wrong with
   me-and with millions of others? . . . we had all played the game of
   apathy u p to that moment . . . confident that Apollo 13 was just one
   more sure-thing deployment of what man already proved he can do.
   The flight reports had to compete for newspaper space and, in some
   newspapers, were slipping into the inside pages.â€ After news of
   oxygen tank explosion â€œastronauts were no longer either three in-
   vincible heroes or three stooges for â€˜the Establishment,â€™ but simply
   three human beings caught in space a quarter-million miles from
   home . . . Through the plight of our proxies . . . we caught-a
   glimpse of how perilous manâ€™s whole enterprise is, how tragic, in
   fact, his whole existence is in this shaky cosmos that runs by laws
   until you hit the unexplainable.â€
      Apollo 13 was â€œa tiny, mobile version of the earth, with a power
   failure and the shortage of water and a danger of polluted air and the
   erratic fortunes of communicating and the image of three men hav-
   ing to read their instruments with a flashlight in the darkness of the
   cabin.â€ (P Bull, 4/20/70)

      National Observer: â€œAt a time when Americans were becoming
   bored with successful flights to the moon, the ordeal of Apollo 13
   reminded the nation of the dangers and difficulties of space. But
   because of courage, care, and uncommon resourcefulness-be-
   cause, in fact, of historyâ€™s most dramatic field expedient-the astro-
    nauts made their way safely back to earth. The first walk on the
    moon was a wonder of wonders, but the return of Apollo 13 was the
   gladdest moment of them all.â€ (National Observer, 4/20/70)

        Wall Street Journal: â€œAssuming all feasible precautions are tak-
   en, then, the issue of death potential should not really be a major
    factor in assessing the space program, and particularly the very
    costly moon program. That program should be judged on whether
    any gains from it are proportionate to the totality of its costs. Some
    scientists and laymen believe the costs are disproportlonate. At any
    rate, that is the proper criterion for weighing the future of space
    exploration, not the admitted and awesome danger of death in eter-

    in same period had not increased established level of 1710 strategic
    nuclear missile launchers, had reduced heavy bomber strength of
    780 by over 200, and had reduced megatonnage by more than 40%.
     â€œExcept for the minimum â€˜hedgeâ€™ that SAFEGUARD will provide, we
     have not responded to the Soviet strategic offensive buildup with
     new deployment programs. We did not respond in past years be-
     cause the United States deliberately chose to assume that the Soviet

   cist Dr. D. A. Papanastassiou, had found aGe of lava-born Apollo
   12 rocks to be 3.4billion yrs, rather than preliminary estimate of 2.6
  billion yrs. Apollo 11 rocks were found to be 3.65 billion yrs old.
   Evidence indicated both areas of moon had been formed from same
   sustained process lasting some 300 million yrs. There was â€œwide-
   spread outpouringâ€ of lava over sea regions of moon about 3.5 bil-
   lion yrs ago. Evidence suggested Sea of Storms, where Apollo 12

April21: Apollo 13Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., John L. Swigert, Jr.,
   and Fred W. Haise, Jr., described their initial reaction to Apollo 13
   accident to press at MSC. Lovell explained: â€œFred was still in the
   lunar module, Jack was back in the command module in the left-
   hand seat, and I was halfway in between the lower equipment
   bay. . .when all three of us heard a rather large bang, just one bang.
   Now, before that, Fred. . .had actuated a valve which nominally
   gives us the same sound. . .so when this bang came we really didnâ€™t
   get concerned right away, but I looked up at Fred and Fred had that
   expression like it wasnâ€™t his fault, and we suddenly realized that
   something else had occurred, but exactly what we didnâ€™t know.â€
      Swigert said he had felt vibration accompanying bang and then
   noticed master alarm and main bus B undervolt light. â€œI transmitted
   to Houston that we had a problem and proceeded to. . .look at the
   voltage. . .[which] at that time was completely normal. . . .â€ Swigert
   thought bang had occurred in LM and Haise, in LM, thohght it had
   occurred in CM.
      Lovell said his first impression was â€œthat we had had an electrical
   problem that caused this bang. . . . That quickly went away and then
   I looked out the window and saw this venting and my concern was
   increasing all the time. It went from I wonder what this is going to
   do to the landing to I wonder if we can get back home again. It was
   apparent. . .that the only way to survive the situation was to transfer
   to the LM. , . .â€

     to move forward in the 1970â€™s with the space program we have out-
     lined to you. . . .â€ Dr. Paine said President Nixon â€˜â€˜fully shares this
     view .â€ (Testimony)
         Dr. Petrone testified: â€œThis long arduous voyage continuously
     presented the challenge to balance the spacecraft systems required
     to perform necessary functions against the availability of consuma-
     bles, of water, electrical power, oxygen, and the lithium hydroxide
     to remove the carbon dioxide. The options available to flight and
     ground crews in every case permitted acceptable courses of action
     to be selected. During this emergency situation, the remaining sys-
     tems performed in an outstanding manner meeting the unusual de-
      mands placed upon them. At the same time, the flight and ground
     crews demonstrated exceptional confidence in meeting these sets of
     unusual circumstances.â€
         Mission ended with â€œset of consumables which were within about
     two percent of what we had predicted back at 63 hours or about sev-
     en hours after the problem occurred,â€ Lunney told Committee. â€œIf
     the consumable posture. . .had worsened or if we had absorbed an-
      other failure. . .we would have had to resort to scheduling communi-
      cation times with the crew.â€ Although probably within 12 hours to
      24 of running out of most critical consumable, water, â€œhad we pro-
      ceeded into. . .duty cycling the communications gear onboard, we
      probably could have stretched that period.â€
         Astronaut Lovell described crewâ€™s feelings during crisis: â€œWe
      soon realized that our only hope of survival was to go into Aquarius,
      power up its systems and use the systems and the consumables on
      board. . .for a return home. And it was here that we realized that it
      was now a case of survival.â€ Spacecraft was on trajectory that
      â€œwould have entered us in a sort of permanent orbit, some .
      230. . .thousand miles [370000 km] in apogee, and maybe a thou-
      sand [1600 km] or so in perigee.. . . Again, the ground came
      through, and gave us. . .the free trajectory burn, which was required
      to get us back to earth. My main concern at this point was to get this
      spacecraft back within the earthâ€™s atmosphere.â€ (Transcript)

      fan-in-wing configurations for VTOL aircraft in $750 000 V/STOL
      wind-tunnel facility, Lewis News said. Concept was one of several
      being studied for use in VTOL aircraft. Current studies were to deter-
      mine variation in fan thrust and efficiency as horizontal airflow over
      fan increased. Subsequent tests would use more efficient version of
      existing rotor to study effect of devices to prevent boundary-layer
      separation during change to horizontal flight and louvers to direct
      exhaust rearward. October tests of three small fans in longitudinal

0 Gen. James Ferguson, AFSC Commander, discussed role of military in
   current controversies over cost and efficiency of F-111 and C-5A
   aircraft during Seventh Space Congress at Cocoa Beach, Fla.: "If
   we in military development have been remiss, I would say it is be-
   cause we not only failed to fully communicate the difficulties in-
   volved in pushing the state of the art, but we also neglected to stress
   the uncertainties between known design parameters on paper and
   the hardware that ultimately results. To the intense competition for
   finite resources, and to a flood of paper studies, we reacted with
   overoptimism and neglected to properly qualify the normal uncer-
   tainties of development or the technical risks involved." Advancing
   state of the art was "synonymous with working beyond the bounda-
   ries of the certain and the known. As long as we operate at these
   outer limits of science and technology, performance, schedule and
   cost are inevitably going to be, at best, elastic parameters. The alter-
   native is to stand pat with the F-4, the B-52, and the C-141. Such an
   alternative would be hardly supportable in even a static world."

   ellite with its own booster following the Soviet Union, the United
   States, France and Japan. Working in close cooperation with the
   U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Australia, and the European
   Space Research Organization (ESRO) have flown Earth satellites.
   This new development has been anticipated for some time. . . . It is
   a dramatic demonstration of the determination of the Chinese lead-
   ers, despite many problems, to put science and technology very high
   on their list of national priorities.â€ (Text)

   greeted in Peking with crashing of drums and cymbals. Thousands
   of Chinese converged on Tien An Men Square in demonstration
   which Washington Post said had been â€œwell organizedâ€ since
   launch had been expected for â€œsome time.â€ Groups of teenagers,
    children, and even grandmothers marched behind red banners and
    large portraits of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Peopleâ€™s Liberation

   wordsâ€; Chinese had barely mentioned Soviet space activities since
   nations became enemies. Romania congratulated Chinese for â€œfresh
   successes in the field of scientific investigation of outer space.â€
   Albania also hailed achievement.
       U.K. Minister of Technology Anthony Wedgwood Benn sent
   message to Chinese government congratulating engineers and space
   workers on launch. West Germanyâ€™s Bochum Observatory called
   event greater technological feat than 1957 launch of Soviet Sputnik

    interests. . .are similarly unhappy with their new satellite competi-
    tor.â€ ComSatCorp stock holders were displeased that company had
    yet to pay dividend. â€œEven foreign countries, which have benefited
    by Comsatâ€™s experience in establishing an international satellite
    network now resent Comsatâ€™s dominant position in that system.â€

      and consistent commitment to long-range research, uninterrupted
      support of graduate education, improved use of Federal laborato-
      ries, and improved process for establishing priorities in Federal
      support of science.

     creasing long-term participation by private institutions-particularly
     business-in social, urban, and environmental programs and direct
     appropriate departments and agencies to identify deterrents to pri-
     vate investment of capital and technology in these programs; sug-

    been eager to have NASA provide program of high-energy astronomy
    payloads in 4500- to 9000-kg (10 000- to 20 000-lb) class that would
    be launched by vehicles of Titan-Centaur capability. Large x-ray
    detector could â€œvery likely detect thousands of weak sources and
    discover high-frequency pulsar characteristics, if present. Such a
    program,â€ HEAO (High Energy Astronomy Observatory), â€œwas to
    have begun in 1970 but has been a casualty of the present budgetary

    had devoted $30 billion to space program, $40 billion each for cos-
    metics and soft drinks, almost $80 billion each for cosmetics and
    soft drinks, almost $80 billion for tobacco, and some $ 1 10 billion for
    alcoholic beverages-about four times cost of space program. An-
    nual space expenditure had been about one half of 1% of GNP, and
    about 1/20th of defense expenditure. Most expensive space program
    had been Apollo at $24 billion, 93% of which was spent for goods
    and services provided by private industry. To date, â€œno money at all

May 1: Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, held press
   briefing at MSC on Apollo 13Review Boardâ€™s progress in investiga-
   tion of accident that aborted April 11-17 mission: Combination â€œof
   all the data from telemetry, from all the testing of all the analytical
   work and perhaps information from photographsâ€ would be re-
   quired â€œto determine the most probable cause or causesâ€ of April
    13 accident. Board believed most probable sequence of events was:
   Short circuit in oxygen tank No. 2 caused combustion within tank.
   â€œThis in turn caused the pressure and a temperature within the tank
   to increase. The tank then ruptured. This rupture. . . caused the
   pressure in the compartment in which the tank is located to increase
   which then caused. . . the big covering panel in the Service Module
   to blow off .â€ Panel hit high-gain antenna and knocked it out, caus-
   ing brief loss of data.
       Preflight events of possible significance included change of mo-
   tors of fans inside tank at Beech Aircraft Co. plant early in manu-
   facture. â€œLater on the tank, itself, was. . .moved from one space-
   craft and installed in spacecraft 109 and during the removal from
    spacecraft.. .106, it was jarred or dropped an inch or two [5-10
    cm]. . . . Finally, during the loading and unloadin of the tank during
                                                      a
   the countdown demonstration tests at the Cape t ere was an anom-
    aly which made it very difficult to get the oxygen out of the tank.
   This was several weeks before the flight and a new procedure not
    previously tried was used in the detankingâ€-gaseous oxygen â€œwas
    pumped into the tank and released again, the heaters were turned off
    and on. . . .â€

May 17: Serf I1 (Space Electric Rocket Test), launched Feb. 3, had
    reached halfway point of six-month endurance test in space with ion
    engine operating satisfactorily for more than 2000 hrs, NASA an-
    nounced. Experiment to determine whether electric rocket opera-
    tion would interfere with radio communications between space-
    craft, electric propulsion system, and nearby space indicated there
    would be no problem. Experiment to measure effects of ion thruster
    efflux on silicon-cell solar array showed solar cells were being ad-
    versely affected. As ions were emitted through molybdenum grid,
    small particles of grid broke off (sputtered) and were deposited on

     duction-in-force of at least 1300 NASA civil service employees in
     addition to reduction planned in FY 1971 budget. â€œBased on past
     experience, a reduction-in-force. . .has an impact on three to five

   during 1969: â€œPopular interest in the space program, which reached
   a high oint with the first successful lunar landing, has diminished
   somewrlat. Furthermore, a reassessment of national priorities has
                                  a
   resulted in reduced financial su port for space research and technol-
   ogy during the past year, an the support will probably be even
   more limited this year and next. It is our intention, despite these lim-
   itations, to try to maintain a reasonably balanced program, with con-
   tinuing effort in all areas of space research in which we are currently
   engaged and to support mutually advantageous international coop-
   eration in space research wherever possible.â€ (Text)

0 DOT issued statement defending SST: There was â€œlittle or no substance
    to the claims of SST critics that harm will result from the planeâ€™s
    development, [and] there are some very real threats to the national
    interest if it is not put into production on schedule.â€ Planned SST
    flight rules would confine aircraftâ€™s noise to airfield. There was â€œno
    scientific supportâ€ for allegation that supersonic flights at 18 300 m
    (60 000 ft) would pollute upper atmosphere and change worldâ€™s
    weather. Overpass of SST at supersonic speeds would not disrupt
    earthâ€™s natural environment.
       Without SST program, â€œUnited States would surely lose its world
    leadership as an aircraft supplier.â€ Loss of SST sales, â€œcombined
    with the increased purchase by U.S. airlines of foreign-built super-
    sonics, is estimated to result in an unfavorable swing of some $16
    billion in balance of payments through 1990.â€ Halt or slowdown in
    SST program â€œwould be equally serious to the domestic economy.â€

  LRL scientist Frederick J. Mitchell reported microorganism-Strepto-

    veyor I11 camera before April 17, 1967, lunar launch had been re-
    covered from inside camera after it was returned to earth by Apollo
     12 crew in November 1969. Streptococcus mitis was common
    respiratory organism and had produced no disease on animal inno-
    culation. Mitchell said microorganism was probably deposited on
    camera when cameraâ€™s shroud was removed for repairs and then
    replaced. Procedures and high vacuum of space were thought to
    have been responsible for preservation of organism in lyophilized
    (freeze-dried) state during launch, 3-day moon journey, and 950-day
    stay in hostile lunar environment. Organism had been found after

    of the new-generation aircraft. . .this lightning hazard will in-
    crease. If the new aircraft are permitted to fly under the same me-
    teorological conditions that are considered allowable for present
    aircraft, the probability of the aircraftâ€™s being hit by lightning will be
    considerably increased.â€ New aircraft would not be as safe as con-
    ventional aircraft in lightning strikes â€œbecause of their extensive use
    of more sophisticated hardware, which is more susceptible to dam-

During May: In Astronautics and Aeronautics, JPL scientists William
      G. Breckenridge and Thomas C. Duxbury discussed applications of
      spacecraft- based navigation data for outer-planet missions and de-
      scribed processing of spacecraft-based science and en ineering data
      from 1969 Mariner Mars missions. They concluded: â€œ8tringent nav-
      igation requirements for proposed outer-planet missions make even
      the projected ability of a solely Earthbased system marginal, and so
      have emphasized the need for an onboard system.â€ (A&A, 5/70,44-

  Space/Aeronautics editorial commented on Apollo 13 accident: â€œIt
    has shown us how vulnerable are the men who go into space in their
    tiny, fragile capsules. It has stunned us into the realization that acci-
    dents can and will happen in space, that not every mission will run
    off like clockwork, that manned space flight is, and will always be,
    dangerous. Public awareness, finally, that this is so could immeasur-
    ably strengtheh the space program. If so, Apollo 13 may prove to be
    one of the most important missions we have flown to date.â€ (S/A,

  Armed Forces Management editorial by Michael Getler said nuclear
    test ban treaty â€œcame only after the Soviets unilaterally broke a
    testing moratorium to gather what they needed to know in the vital
    area of weapons effects, and the ink was barely dry on the Peaceful
    Uses of Outer Space Treaty when the Pentagon announced the Rus-
    sians were testing a new Fractional Orbital Bombardment System
    that was certainly a spiritual, if not technical, violation of that

0 Medical experience in Apollo 7 through I 1 was summarized by Dr.
    Charles A. Berry, MSC Director of Medical Research and Opera-
    tions, in Aerospace Medicine: â€œThe 3105 hours of exposing man to
    spaceflight during the Apollo program have added reatly to knowl-

    edge of manâ€™s response to space travel.â€ S acecra t cabin environ-
    ment had been â€œsuitably maintainedâ€; rafiation environment had
    been â€œbenign,â€ with no solar flares occurring; crews had adapted
    well to weightlessness; and improvements had been made in inflight
    food. Body-weight losses which continued to occur were not entire-
    ly due to body fluid loss. Supplying potable water had been effec-
    tive and â€œgreat strides have been made in removing gas bubbles in
    the water. â€™ Work-sleep cycles had been improved and bioinstru-
    mentation had continued to function well.
       â€œAlthough a preflight preventative medicine program has been
    difficult to conduct, it has been effective in the later Apollo missions
    in reducing pre-, in-, and postflight illnesses, which had occurred in
    all flight phases and were usually viral upper respiratory and gas-
    trointestinal infeGtions.â€ Although crews had adapted to motion
    environment, â€œthis .area will require continuing attention.â€
       Cardiovascular deconditioning had been identified after Right, along
    with â€œsignificant decrement in work capacity in immediate postflight
    period.â€ Postflight neutrophilia had been observed after crew re-
    covery. Loss of red cell mass observed in Gemini program had reoc-
    curred only during Apollo 9, indicating that hyperoxia was responsi-
    ble. Even small amount of nitrogen in atmosphere might protect red
    cells from lytic action of oxygen. Microbiological studizs had shown

   of earthâ€™s geagraphy and atmosphere, research into â€œphysical proc-
   esses in near-earth space,â€ and checkout of spacecraft systems.
   Launch and pictures of crew in spacecraft were televised in Mos-
   cow about one hour after liftoff.
      Five hours after liftoff Tass reported cosmonauts were â€œcoping
   well with conditions of weightlessness and carrying out the flight
   program.â€ Only anomaly had been dirtying of windows from engine
   fired for midcourse maneuver after fifth orbit, Tass said. Systems
   were functioning normally and Nikolayev had begun â€œexperiments
   linked with the investigation of human peculiarities as an element of
   the control system in different dynamic operations.â€
       Tass issued daily bulletins that described routine of space flight
   chores and experiments: â€œWhile one cosmonaut runs a vacuum
   cleaner, the other brews coffee or shaves.â€ Cosmonauts performed
   strenuous physical exercises each day in special â€œload suits,â€™â€™ prac-
   ticed manual maneuvers of spacecraft, and photographed earth and
   sun. By June 8 Soyuz IX had completed 100 orbits and 147 hrs of
   flight-record for man-hours in space in Soviet space program-
   with all systems functioning satisfactorily and with crew demon-
   strating it could â€œwithstand well the complex impact of the factors
   of space flight and retain high efficiency.â€ Insomnia, only problem
   reported by crew, had been overcome.

   which will help pin down some of the details of what took place.â€
   One of the key tests at MSC was related to special detanking and
   checkout procedures before launch. Tests had found faulty thermal
   switches and tâ€˜demopstrated that if these thermal switches, had

   begin to view the earth in all its finite reality and recognize that â€˜ex-
   ponential projectionsâ€™ of the sac-iety of man and his works on earth
    are not only undesirable (if not impractical), but indeed they be-
    come unreal carried into the indefinite future. Accordingly, we do
   better to think in terms of the ultimate equilibrium we would like to
    see man achieve with and on spaceship earth, and from this vantage
   point we are drawn naturally to considerations of how best to ap-
   proach and find the desired equilibrium .â€ Population projections
   thus â€œwould be expected to evolve . . .in accordance with satisfy-
    ing the requirements of dynamic stability of the society of man in
    relation to his environment both natural and artificial. Technology,
    from earth-based to space-based, must play a massive role in this

   Manager, presented paper on main propulsion requirements or ful-
   ly reusable space shuttle engine concept and new approaches to en-
   gine development and testing. Throttling to only 50% thrust satisfied
   systemâ€™s needs and was baseline requirement. Value of one second
   of specific impulse had been calculated at $25 000 000. Payload sen-
   sitivity of space shuttle concepts under study was 6900-8900 new-
   tons (1500-2000 Ibs per sec) of impulse. Minimum impulse per sec-
   ond in basic requirements represented 96% efficiency, â€œwhich has
   not been achieved in any rocket engine to date.â€
      Reusability requirement might be most difficult of all. â€œOne can
   speculate that if we can do it in aircraft engines, why not rocket en-
   gines? But we are talking about heat fluxes and turbomachinery
   characteristics in the shuttle engine that extend well beyond those
   experienced in the engines of the [Boeing] 707,747, or even the mili-
   tary high performance aircraft. It is yet to be shown if we can fly 100
   missions (or even 10 or 20) with this high performance engine, and
   achieve the confidence and maintainability which the airline opera-
   tions have in hand. . . .reusability adds a new dimension to rocket

   and space shuttle vehicles, AFSC announced. Study was based on
    requirements that space escape vehicle (SEV) must perform all func-
    tions required for crew safety from decision to abandon spacecraft
    until successful recovery. In delayed return, ground station would
    supply data to aid selection of recovery site; sufficient oxygen and
    water to last 24 hrs after departure from spacecraft would be availa-
    ble. In â€œquick return,â€ life support would be provided for only six
    hours. SEV would become autonomous following issue of â€œMay
    Dayâ€ signal and would splash down without ground-based advice.
    Crew would plot recovery course using wristwatches and informa-
    tion indicating orbital paths for 24 hrs. Study recommended three
    kinds of escape vehicle: spherical heat shield, rigid vehicle thermal-
    ly protected by ablative heat shield; rib-stiffened expandable vehicle
    which would function like umbrella; and two-man conical reentry
    vehicle like rubber raft, inflatable and made of double-wall fabric
    connected by woven drop threads. (AFSC Release 137.70)

June 15: Apollo 13 Review Board accident report was released by

    of an unusual combination of mistakes coupled with a somewhat
    deficient and unforgiving design.â€
       After assembly and acceptance testing, oxygen tank No. 2 that
    flew on Apollo 13 had been shipped from Beech Aircraft Corp. to
    NR in apparently satisfactory condition. â€œIt is now known, howev-
    er, that theâ€™ tank contained two protective thermostatic switches on
    the heater assembly which were inadequate and would subsequently

               a
    fail during round test operations. . . . In addition, it is probable
    that the tan contained a loosely fitting fill tube assembly. . .which
    was loose when it left the plant. . .[and] was subsequently dis-
    placed during handling. . .[and] led to the use of improvised de-
    tanking procedures. . .which almost certainly set the stage for the
    accident. â€
       Special detanking rocedures at KSC subjected tank to extended
                         R
    heater operation. â€œT ese procedures had not been used before and
    the tank had not been qualified by test for the conditions experi-
    enced. However the procedures did not violate the specifications
    which governed the operation of the heaters. . . . In reviewing
    these procedures before the flight, officials. . .did not recognize the
    possibility of damage due to overheating.
       â€œThe thermostatic switch discrepancy was not detected. . . .
    Nor did tests identify the incompatibility of the switches with the
    ground support equipment at KSC. . . . As shown by subsequent
    tests, failure of the thermostatic switches probably permitted the
    temperature of the heater tube assembly to reach as much as 1000
    degrees Fahrenheit [810 K] in spots during the continuous eight-
    hour period of heater operation. From that time on the oxygen
    tank. . .was in a hazardous condition when filled with oxygen and
    electrically powered.
        â€œHowever it was not until nearly 56 hours into the mission that
    the fan motor wiring possibly moved by the fan stirring of the fluid
    contents of the tank short circuited and ignited the wiring insulation
    by means of an electric arc. The resulting combustion in the oxygen
    tank probably overheated and failed the wiring conduit where it en-
    ters the tank and possibly a portion of the tank itself. The rapid ex-
    pulsion of high pressure oxygen which followed possibly augmented
    by combustion of insulation in the space surrounding the tank blew
    off the outer panel. . .of the service module, caused a leak in the
    high pressure system of Oxygen Tank Number 1, damaged the high
    gain antenna, caused other miscellaneous damage and aborted the
    mission.â€
       Board recommended that cryogenic oxygen storage system be
    modified to minimize use of combustible materials and remove ma-
    terials that might short-circuit from contact with potential ignition
    sources and that system be rigorously requalified; onboard warning
    systems be reviewed and modified; consumables and emergency
    equipment be reviewed to determine whether potential for use .in
     â€œlifeboatâ€ mode should be enhanced; MSC continue special tests
    and analyses under way to understand better the accident details;
    standard procedures require â€œpresentation of all prior anomaliesâ€™â€™
    whenever significant anomalies occurred in critical subsystems dur-
    ing fina1 preparations for launch; NASA thoroughly reexamine all
    spacecraft, launch vehicles, and ground systems to identify and
    evaluate potential combustion hazards and conduct additional re-
    search on materials compatibility, ignition, and combustion in
    strong oxidizers at various g levels; and MSC reassess all Apollo
    spacecraft subsystems and engineering organizations responsible
    for them to ensure adequate understanding of subsystems at sub-
    contractor and vendor level.

       Major recommendations on C-5A subsystems were: reconfigure
    triple-redundant pitch, roll, and heading sensor assemblies from two
    attitude heading reference units (AHRUS) and one inertial measure-
    ment unit (IMU) to three AHRUS, retaining IMU for navigation only;
    provide triple redundancy for fail-operational pitch, roll, and head-
    ing information fed to cockpit displays; substitute state-of-the-art
    weather and mapping radar for multimode radar (MMR) for transport
    mission until reliability for other modes had been demonstrated by
    MMR. Board found static tests had demonstrated 80% of design ulti-
    mate strength, while full-scale test article had accumulated only
    1500 simulated hours of life. It recommended additional modifica-
    tions to wing structure and program for tracking use of each individ-
    ual C-5A aircraft by load recorders, to adjust inspection intervals
    and monitor remaining life. It also recommended acceleration of all
    tests, to identify problems in laboratory rather than in service; sec-
    ond wing-fatigue test; and choice by uSAF of one of several propos-
    als to enable wing to meet static strength requirements. (DOD Re-

    station, then the NASA budget can be trimmed to a level below $3 bil-
    lion per year throughout the rest of this decade. Such a decision will
    shift NASAâ€™s   priorities from sensational manned space ventures to
   space science and its applications. If the U.S. space program is re-
   structured to this new pattern and the Apollo manned lunar program

   would be desirable that the scientific community gjve some expres-
   sion of its sense of priorities for space science with respect to the

   must be reckoned as pure or basic or fundamental research. As

   clear choice. They can seize the opportunity offered by the technical
   revolution of the 1970â€™s and exploit it fully to provide U.S. security
    and economic and social leadership in this troubled world. Or they

0 Possible pollution of stratosphere by SST was discussed in Science:
    â€œAn environment issue that has been intensifying in recent weeks is
    the question of whether exhaust products added to the stratosphere
   by the SST could produce significant environmental changes.â€ Most
    meteorologists agreed gaseous exhaust products other than water
    would present no special problems. Water was â€œmoie likely to be a
    problem because stratospheric water concentrations are generally
    low as the result of condensation in the troposphere.â€™â€™ Water accu-
    mulated in troposphere could change radiation balance of earth; ini-
    tiate cloud formation, thus increasing amount of solar energy re-
    flected into space; or lead to decrease in o.zone concentration of
    stratosphere, â€œthereby allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach
    the earthâ€™s surface.â€ However, there was not enough information
    available to predict whether persistent clouds would form, since no
    research flights had been made in cold areas of tropical tropopause
    and above Arctic and Antarctic, which were believed to be saturat-
    ed. (Nuessle, Holcomb, Science, 6/26/70, 1562)

0 MIT oceanographer Dr. Henry Stommel commented in Science, on
    prospects for physical oceanography: â€œIs the dynamics of the
    ocean similar to or fundamentally different from that of the atmos-
    phere? Only measurement will tell, and it will have to be measure-
    ment at a level of technological sophistication quite beyond the pre-
    sent level and beyond that proposed for routine monitoring. Access
    to somebodyâ€™s monitoring system, or to a few years of ship time,
    will not suffice to obtain the kind of information the scientist needs
    about the oceanic velocity field. Some carefully designed measure-
    ment programs are going to be needed-on a scale larger than an
    oceanographic institution can manage but smaller than .the space
    program. To be useful scientifically, these programs will have to
    give first priority to questions of hydrodynamics. To date there is lit-
    tle indication they will do so.â€ (Science, 6/26/70, 1531-6)

   NASA Assistant Administrator for Policy; Richard H. Petersen, Sen-
   ior Research Scientist in ARC Mission Analysis Div.; and Nathaniel B.
   Cohen, special assistant in NASA policy research program. Because
   of long-life requirements of its structure, I! was unlikely that hyper-
   sonic transport would be developed unt!l operational experience
   was available on some other hypersonic aircraft. Therefore, hyper-
   sonic transport would benefit not only from technology developed
   for space-shuttle vehicle, but very probably from exper!ence gained
   during shuttle operation. Operating experience with high-tempera-
   ture structures would help immensely in developing longer life
   structures for hypersonic transport. and gain considerable. new
   knowledge of hypersonic aerodynamics. In contrast to situation in
   aerodynamics and structures, technology program being planned by
    NASA to support development of rocket propulsion for shuttle would
   not contribute significantly to hypersonic airbreathing-propulsion-
   system technology. Current generalized scramjet research program
   had amply demonstrated feasibility of such engines. Developing

    were defective.â€

    issued statement: â€œOn April 9 I requested the GAO to conduct a re-
    view of the events leading to the selection of the General Electric
    Co. rather than the Fairchild Hiller Corp. to build two Applications

       â€œThe General Accounting Office has reported to me that the Fair-
    child Hiller Corp. may not have been accorded an equal opportunity
    to submit a winning bid because of a one-week extension granted to
    General Electric who turned in the lower bid.

       Daniel J. Fink, Vice President and General Manager of General

    single detail that Fairchildâ€™s pioposal was submitted one week ear-
    lier than ours. . . .both parties had the opportunity to inform NASA
    when they could submit their proposal and both parties responded
    accordingly. The Fairchild implication that this difference in time
    could have been used unfairly by General Electric by our learning
    our competitorâ€™s price and changing ours is a shocking allegation.
    No such â€˜leakâ€™ occurred, and the GAO report specifically states that
    there is no evidence to support that allegation.â€ Fink said facts were
     â€œthat both parties competed hard for this important space program
    which has the potential of contributing greatly to our well being in
    this country and in several foreign countries where this communica-
    tions satellite will be used.â€ (Text)

     policy. . must be formulated on an evolutionary basis, continuously
     under review and subject to change with changing conditions. It
     must be a policy that can be implemented both by the Aministration
     and by Congress and one which will be supported by the public.â€
     Policy should provide â€œstrong base of scienceâ€ and â€œmechanisms
     for using science and technology to meet changing problems of na-
     tional concern.â€ It should â€œrecognize that policies and events whol-
     ly outside the field of science and technology may strongly influence
     our R&D expenditure level.â€
        Dr. DuBridge told Subcommittee some of nationâ€™s â€œmost valua-
     ble and productive research projectsâ€ had been lost because of FY
      1970 amendment to DOD appropriation bill which banned defense-
     financed studies unless they had direct relation to military missions.

       Keldysh said Soyuz IX had provided foundation for new missions
    of more than 30 days, â€œquite long enough for a long-term orbital
    mission, because such stations presuppose crew changes.â€ Earlier
    Soyuz missions devoted to rendezvous, maneuvering, docking, and
    transfer had been programmed to provide essential crew change
    knowledge. U.S.S.R.â€™s main task now was â€œorbital stations

0 In Science editorial, Brown Univ. scientist Dr. A. Hunter Dupree out-
    lined changes that would shape new U.S. science policy: DOD had
    lost ability to justify support for basic research and to attract many
    scientists. â€œIf the scientists knowledgeable in military research,
    who provide one of the groups with the best chance to change the
    course of events with competent criticism, lose touch with the De-
    partment of Defense completely, an unparalleled disaster could
    ensue. Yet, a reordering of the relation of the scientific community
    to the Department of Defense cannot be postponed.â€™â€™ Scientific
    community needed to pay more attention to environmental prob-
    lems. Space program â€œmust find a role for itself with predominantly
    scientific objectives and a steady state of funding.â€™â€™ Social sciences
    must receive greater emphasis. Justification of Federal support for
    research in universities must emphasize goal of building healthy in-
    stitutions in national interest. And supporl for education â€œmust con-
    template a national research program with a radically different mix
    of disciplines from that recently prevailin .â€ (Science, 7/10/70, 131)

       power that thundered at Alamogordo, was almost trivial in compari-
      .son with that which exists in any one of thousands of atomic and
       hydrogen bombs now in the arsenals of five nuclear powers. But the
       ingenuity and industry which have added so much to the effective-
       ness of the military atom have not yet been matched by correspond-
       ing political accomplishment aimed at protecting all mankind, at
       guaranteeing there will be no successors to Hiroshima and Naga-
       saki. Todayâ€™s reality among the major powers is a peace based on
       mutual terror. . . .â€ (NYT,7/16/70,32)

       tioned interests that have grown up around this nationâ€™s atomic
       technology are being forced onto the defensive by a rising public
       clamor for reform,â€ Anthony Ripley said in New York Times. â€œBit-
       ter, often emotional accusations of carelessness, duplicity and indif-
       ference are being sounded over a broad range of subjects by scien-
       tists, politicians, peace groups, environmentalists and laymen con-
       cerned about health and safety.â€ Government and industry had es-
       tablished more than 100 atomic-electric plants in 31 states during
       last few years. AEC had been â€œgearing up its weapons plants to in-
       crease Defense Departmentâ€™s supply of strategic nuclear warheadsâ€
       by almost 300%.
          Public knowledge about atomic energy was focused on weapons,
       power plants, and Project Plowshare to find peaceful uses for atom-
       ic explosions but much of AECâ€™S funding went for projects like atom
       smashers, including 200-bev accelerator under constrdction at Bata-
       via, Ill., for $250 million. U.S. had spent about $49 billion on atomic
       energy since 1940, with about two thirds for weapon development.
       While five-man AEC watched over â€œmassive operation,â€ real power
       was wielded by Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.
       President Nixon had proposed that AEC Div. of Radiation Protection
       Standards be shifted to new Environmental Protection Agency. Plan
       was expected to meet strong opposition in Joint Committee as was
       Administration plan for remaking AEC into agency dealing with all
       forms of energy. ( N Y T , 7/16/70,1)

July 18: President Nixon issued statement on Congressional action and
   - Government spending: There was â€œpersistent a n d growing tenden-
     cyâ€ in Congress to approve increase in expenditures â€œwithout pro;
     viding the revenue to pay the costs.â€ It had become â€œalmost a cliche
     to say that all we need do to resolve this dilemma with regard to our
     Federal budget is to cut space and defense outlays and â€˜change our
     national priorities.â€™ Letâ€™s set the record straight. We have changed
     our national priorities. â€
        In proposed FY 1971 budget, spending for human resources (45%)
     exceeded defense spending (32%) for â€œthe first time in 20 years.â€
     To accomplish â€œthis massive change in emphasis, military and
     space expenditures were cut by some $6 billion.â€ But continuation
     of pattern of Congressional action would substantiall increase ex-
     penditures. President asked Congress to establish â€œ&m ceiling on
     total expenditures,â€™â€™ within which he could determine priorities.

    face points on earth 4800 km (3000 mi) apart with 9.8-m (32-ft) accu-
    racy. Pageos Iwould be photographed from U.S. and Canadian sites
    in new program to enable land surveyors and engineers to start their
    surveys from geodetic control points with greater accuracy. Com-

    research, but in fewer areas than previously.â€ Research â€œin aero-
    dynamics, aeropropulsion, and structures will always be directly
    related to the Air Force missions.â€ Research â€œin solid state physics
    and chemistry will be directly related to the Air Force mission as
    long as we need new electronic systems and lighter, higher tempera-
    ture materials. But research in fields such as astrophysics (other
    than solar phenomena that do affect our operations) is probably
    permanently removed from the Air Force program .â€ (Testimony)

    Limitations in program lay in areas of manned space flight, large-
    booster development, and cooperation with U.S.S.R. Low level of
    European space budgeting accounted for gaps in manned space
    flight and booster development. Lack of Soviet cooperation â€œseems
    to rest with Soviet political views rather than with technical prob-
    lems or any lack of interest by the United States.â€ Despite restrict-
    ing factors abroad, there was â€œevery reason to persevere with exist-

0 Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, held press conference at
    NASA Hq. to comment on his resignation, submitted July 28: â€œWhen
    I faced up to the job in the Space Agency. . .there were two major
    responsibilities. . . . One. . .was the meeting of the
    commitment. . .[to] land on the Moon within the decade. . .and
    the second was to lay out the post-Apollo program which would fql-
    low. . . . The action that was taken yesterday by the Congress in
    conference, which essentially gave us more than ninety-eight per-
    cent of the monies that the President had approved for the 1971
    budget, but more importantly followed a very intensive review by
    Congress of the proposals we had made for the new space program
    of the seventies, in many ways represents a major step forward in
    the second concern which I had, which was to lay out the post-
    Apollo program and secure initial approval for it in the Administra-
    tion and the Congress.â€
        NASA â€œhad reached the point where the person who heads up the
    space program should be prepared now to devote very many months
    to the prosecution of this new program. . .and it was my conclusion
    that this was an excellent time for a change of command at NASA,
    since, for personal reasons, I could not give it the many months of
    continuing activity which would be required.â€
        Questioned about future space projects, Dr. Paine said he had
    found â€œgreat depth of supportâ€ for space program in U.S. and in
    foreign countries. Space program was valuable to Nation and world,
    was on solid foundation, and would probably be funded by Govern-
    ment on its present level or a little higher. He identified key issues
    facing NASA in FY 1972 budget as future of Apollo program, particu-
    larly with suspension of Saturn V production and continuing need.to
    reassess best use of each booster, and question of relative priority
    within limited resources of space shuttle, space station, space tug,
     scientific missions, application of satellite programs, and increased
    aeronautical R&D. :â€˜Itâ€™s very important. . .that we take a very long-
                                               x
    range view because. the direction that the s ace program takes in the
     1970â€™s is indeed going to cast a shadow t rough to the end of the

    that peered through atmospheric windows letting in infrared wave-
    lengths between 1P and 25 P .â€ But water vapor had blocked wave-
    lengths from 25-100 p from reaching ground. Now jet aircraft and

    position in the development and production of commercial transport

    domestic economy and U.S. position in international.markets.â€ In
    next two decades, level of the worldâ€™s commercial airline traffic was
    expected to rise to six times as high. SST was â€œlogical. and inevitable

    in basic space technology and application of that technology to mili-
    tary requirements. U.S. programs in communications, mapping,
     warning, surveillance, weather, and other activities related to mili-
    tary had been extremely rewarding. In manned military space opera-

  European space accomplishments were reviewed in Science Journal:
     ESRO was evolving as center for scientific and applications satellites
     and was interested in developing satellites for meteorology, naviga-

     efforts to obtain independence in satellite launching through ELDO.
     U.S. had introduced new element into European deliberations by
     inviting collaboration in post-Apollo program. â€œSo far the U.S.
     State Department has ruled against the purchase of American
     launch vehicles for European commercial ventures, such as the re-
     gional communications satellite. This could be changed by coopera-
     tion in the post-Apollo programme. Europe could reserve the right
     to buy boosters for any non-military application.â€ Cost might be

    other peopleâ€™s susceptibilities, handled them as gently as nervous
    horses. A successor who is less imaginative, or more inclined to

    Congress will react more favorably to post-Apollo if it can be
    launched internationally, on the grounds that it would increase sta-
    bility between nations, and in the !ong term cut the cost of major
    space programmes. For N.A.S.A. it would have the added advan-
    tage that such a programme, once begun, would be difficult for a
    new American administration to halt or cut back dramatically.â€
    Europe held â€œhigh cardâ€ in negotiations toward international space
    program. â€œN.A.S.A. needs a decision early next year so that the

     moon man.â€™ Today his name is commemorated in laboratories and
     professorships, but his greatest lasting memorial does not carry his
     name. It is the background of theoretical principles, engineering
     devices and practical experience, in the decades between World
     War I and 11, that are embodied in every rocket that flies-today. . . .

* Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal seismic investigator for Apollo pro-
   gram, asked astronomers worldwide to study moon each month at
   its closest approach to earth to determine whether surface cracks
   were ope.ning and closing under gravitational attraction. Request
   was made through Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatoryâ€™s Center
   for Study of Short-Lived Phenomena, which mailed â€œalertâ€ cards
   to subscribers. Dr. Latham and NASA team at MSC had determined
   from lunar seismograph left on moonâ€™s surface by Apollo 12 crew
   that moonâ€˜s surface might show 7.6-cm (3041) bulge earthward dur-
   ing these periods. It was also during these periods that astronomers
   studyin moon with ground-based telescopes had reported sudden
            P
   flares o color. If optical observations from telescopes of opening
   and closing of lunar surface cracks could be correlated with detec-
   tion of moonquakes [see July 261, Dr. Latham said, â€œit would be
    strong evidence that the glows are produced by the escape of gases
   from the lunar interior through cracks which open and close each

   They recommended modific5tion of equipment to survey regional
    atmosphere or known polluting sources unattended, by use of re-
    ceivers feeding into computerized data banks via microwave links.

     posium on Environmental Aspects o NucIear Power Stations at
     U.N. in New York. In opening address Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, AEC
     Chairman, said: â€œTremendous worldwide concerns about environ-
     mental matters are certain to cause significant changes in our techni-
     cal approaches to energy problems. Looking well into the future one
     can imagine world-wide power transmission networks which will
     take full advantage of time zone differences and seasonal diversities
     to equalize the overall global daily demand for electricity. Transmis-
     sion of large power over such distances may be brought about by
     cryogenic superconducting cables which are presently under devel-
     opment. Also, power may in the future be transmitted by micro-
     waves or by light.â€ It might be possible â€œto convert large amounts
     of electrical power into lights with a laser beam, transmit this light
     between continents by satellite and then reconvert the energy to
     electricity.â€ (Text)

    semiconductor device that operated continuously at room tempera-
    ture and could be powered by flashlight batteries. Single high-fre-
    quency light beam could carry thousands of TV signals, telephone
    calls, or other messages and might find greatest application when
    picture phones, high-speed computer conversations, and general
    communications needs expanded beyond existing carrying capacity.
    Bell scientists predicted laser ultimately would be pen-light size,
    cost a few dollars, and last a human lifetime. Laser included crystal
    semiconductor smaller than grain of sand, which operated on small
    currrent, eliminating need for extreme cooling. (Brody, N Y T , 9/1!

During August: Boeing Co. announced it had built operational prototype
    of noise-suppressing SST engine inlet for testing with GE4 turbojet
    engine. Tests, to be completed by end of November, were to dem-
    onstrate compatibility and installed performance characteristics of
    propulsion system components. Inlet included movable centerbody
   that, when moved to aft position, created sonic wave in throat re-
    gion, preventing emanation of most high-frequency sound from en-
    gine compressor components during landing approach. Boeing said
    movable centerbody feature, combined with SSTâ€™S rapid takeoff
    climb, would result in better takeoff and landing characteristics than
    those of Boeing 707 subsonic aircraft. (Boeing Release 5-0683)

   â€œThe first of these voyages of exploration begins. . .when, between
   May 6 and June 3, two Mariner-type spacecraft will rise from launch
   pads at Cape Kennedy on the.way to Mars to become the first space-
   craft to orbit that planet.â€ To obtain maximum scientific informa-
   tion, two identical spacecraft would perform separate missions, A
   and B. Each spacecraft would orbit Mars for 90 days in differing in-
   clinations and periods. â€œTogether they will cover 70% of the sur-
   face, permitting the study of seasonal effects. The information
   gained will help in selecting suitable landing zones for the unmanned
   Vikingproject which will land an instrument package on Mars.â€
       Missions would carry six science experiments including TV
   experiment. TV pictures would enlarge understanding of dynamic
   characteristics, history, environment, and surface physiography of
   Mars and improve maps of surface. They were not ex ected to

      urged the development of an advanced space-satellite system for

    International participation in ERTS program was discussed in Asrro-
       nautics & Aeronautics by John Hanessian, Jr., and John M. Logs-
       don, of George Washington Univ.: â€œBroad participation in
       ERTS. . .makes sense only if a global operational Earth-resources-
       survey system follows. The design and institutionalization of such a
       system will test the ingenuity of national and international policy
       makers, and any steps which may make their task less complex are
       desirable. Widespread international involvement in the ERTS pro-
       gram would be such a step. And it would. . .serve [both] the needs
     . of many nations of the world and the national interest of the U.S.
       Many constraints on broad participation in ERTS stem from the level
       of funding and the pace now planned for the program. Thus it falls
       within the power of the U.S, to eliminate them. This we should do.â€

    Significance of Soyuz IX in Soviet efforts toward permanent space
       station was discussed in Science Journal: Although engineering tests
       and scientific observations had been made during June 2-19 mission,
       â€œmajor emphasis was on bio-medical problems of weightlessness
       and post-flight adaptation to normal terrestrial conditions.â€ Indi-
       cations that cosmonautsâ€™ systems were slow in readapting to normal
       gravity had prompted Soviet doctors to suggest it might be neces-
       sary to create artificial gravity in permanent space stations and in
       spacecraft on protracted journeys to planets. Soyuz had been de-
       scribed as â€œprototype space bus able to accommodate three cosmo-
       nauts in comfort and to commute with ease to orbital stations disem-
       barking and taking on passengers through a forward hatch.â€ How
       rapidly U.S.S.R. advanced to this goal depended on many factors,
       â€œnot the least the erfection of the new launch vehicle.â€ (Gatland,

September 2: NASA FY 1971 interim operating plan news conference
   was held in Washington, D.C. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Adminis-
   trator, said principal decision was â€œhow best to carry out the Apollo
   and other existing programs to realize maximum benefits from them
   while preserving adequate resources for the future. . . . In our dis-
   cussions, it became clear that the vitality of our national space pro-
   gram depends on a determined and vigorous continuation of plans
   for a reusable space shuttle followed by a space station in the
   manned flight programâ€; early development of ERTS, ATS, and
   HEAO; Grand Tour unmanned flights to distant planets; unmanned
   Viking Mars landers; Pioneer flights to Venus, Mercury, and Jupi-
   ter; and â€œa healthy aeronautical research program .â€
      â€œWith all of these considerations in mind. . .actions have been
   taken that will effectively reduce NASAâ€™S FY 1971 budget request of
   $3.333 billion to an interim operating plan of $3.2687 billion. . .and
   to minimize NASAâ€™s budgetary requirements for future years.â€
   Budget request for Apollo was being reduced by $42.1 million to
   $914.4 million by canceling Apollo 15 and 19 lunar missions and by
   phasing down manpower levels at major Apollo facilities more rap-
   idly. Although Lunar and Planetary Missions Board and NAS-NRC
   Space Science Board had strongly recommended, after special re-
   view, that NASA carry out all six remaining lunar landing missions,
   NASA had â€œmost reluctantly concluded that a reduction. . .should be
   made.â€ Remaining Apollo missions would be redesignated 14
   through 17 and would be flown before start of Skylab operations in
   November 1972. Schedule would allow additional flexibility by
   providing Apollo hardware for possible use in Skylab, space station,
   or other programs where manned operations or heavy boost capabil-
   ity would be required. Advanced mission studies would be reduced
   by $1 million.
      Tracking and data acquisition network operations would be re-
   duced $8 million by reducing number of manned flights and by more
   rapid phasedown in operating levels. Construction of facilities
   would be reduced to $25 million by deferring Polymer Research
   Laboratory at ARC, Calibration Laboratory at MSC, and Multispec-
   tral Photo Laboratory at MSFC and by rehabilitation and modifica-
   tion effort and facility planning and design. Research and program
   management minimum operating budget would be established at
   $678.7 million, amount included in previous appropriations bill and
   $13.6 million below NASAâ€™s FY 1971 request.
      Dr. Paine said NASA had concluded â€œthat it is prudent and realis-
   tic. . .to make these decisions now. . .to avoid more drastic and dis-
   ruptive actions which would result if the decisions were postponed
   until later in the fiscal year. We also no longer have the capability to
   prepare in parallel two Apollo spacecraft, as would be required to
   maintain an option to reach a later decision on the number of Apollo
   missions.â€

   mination of Venusâ€™s radius in mid-1966. Value, derived from earth-
   based radar observations, was 6055.8 km (3762.9 mi). â€œIn early
    1967, two Mariner 5 experimenters visited us to ascertain our very
   latest value and our confidence in it, stressing the importance of the
   radius for the forthcoming Mariner 5 flyby.â€ Earliest Mariner V
   reports had shown Venus IVdata inconsistent by about 24 km (14.9
   mi) and asymmetry between night and day refractivity profiles of
   Venus. â€œThe central question was: are the surface pressure Ps and

   suggested that 2:l ambiguity had occurred in altimeter. After reex-
   amination of time systems used by Mariner V experimenters, Ve-
   nus-centered distance of ray path had been decreased by 8.85 km
   (5.49 mi), â€œconfirming our independent estimate of 10 km [6.21 mi]

    Press comment on Apollo program cutback:
          Washington Post editorial: â€œThere has rarely been a major pro-
       gram that has gone up the hill and down again as fast as has the
       manned space program. Just a year ago NASA was riding high on the
       success of Apollo 11. Now it is scratching operations and scram-
       bling for money to keep even a portion of the original program and
       its progeny in business. This, in our view, is bad because if it is car-
       ried too far it threatens to turn the entire manned space effort into
       the most spectacular (and most expensive) stunt in history instead
       of the first step in a genuine effort to learn a little more about some
       of the secrets of the universe. NASAâ€™s decision to focus on the future
       rather than on a full study of the moon will help at least to keep the
       option of a worthwhile space program open.â€ ( W Post, 9/6/70, B6)

e End of â€œgalloping scienceâ€ was predicted by Kenneth W. Boulding of
    Univ. of Colorado in Washington Post: â€œThe scientific revolution
    and science-based technology represent a kind of takeoff from the
    old world of classical civilization. The â€˜flightâ€™ of development can-
    not go on forever. At some point there must be a re-entry into
    Spaceship Earth. This re-entry will present acute difficulties. If,
    however, we have a clear view of the nature of the problem, a cer-
    tain optimism about our power to solve it IS entirely reasonable. The
    one great cause for optimism indeed is the clear fact that the evolu-
    tionary potential of the human nervous system iseveryfar from hav-
    ing been exhausted and that there is no nonexistence theorem at
    present about continued human learning.â€ (WPost, 9/6/70, B1)

0 If Anglo-French supersonic transport Concorde emerged from test
     series with reputation intact, it would â€œin its buildersâ€™ eyes confirm
    its image as the spearhead of European technology, and the last de-
     fense against American domination of the aviation industry,â€ Ste-
     phen V. Armstrong said in Washington Post. Public attention was
     focused on aircraftâ€™s sonic boom. West Germany, Sweden, Switzer-
     land, Norway, and Holland had said they were likely to ban super-
     sonic flight over their territories because of boom. Instruments in
     Oban Cathedral in Scotland during recent Concorde 002 tests had
     shown boom produced between 10 300 and 20 700 newtons of pres-
     sure per sq m (1.5 and 3 psf)-equivalent of thunder. BAC officials
     had predicted Concorde would produce no more noise than this in
     commercial service. Concorde opponents were concerned about
     U.S. reports that supersonic airliners could change weather patterns
     by condensing water vapor in atmosphere. Airlines had options on
     only 74 Concordes but BAC was saying it could sell minimum of 200
     by mid-1970s for $24 million each and was considering construction
     of larger model, which would hold 200 rather than 150 passengers.
     Concorde had already cost more than $1 billion and was expected to
     cost $650 million more by 1973. No one expected it to make enough
     to cover this ex enditure. ( W Post, 9/7/70, A13)

September 9-11: Lunar Science Institute in Houston, Tex., sponsored
    seminar on moon findings.
      At meeting on future of Apollo, scientists proposed crater Tycho
   near moonâ€™s south pole and Descartes, hilly region near Ocean of
   Storms, as sites for two of remaining four Apollo program lunar
   landings. Cal Tech geologist Dr. Leon T. Silver said, â€œIf you had
   only two missions left to make, youâ€™d send one of them to Tycho.â€
   Tycho offered samples from area of one of last collisions of large
   meteor with lunar surface, samples from moonâ€™s original southern
   hills, and samples from deep within moon that had come to surface
   after impact that had created Tycho. Flight path to and from Tycho
   would enable astronauts to photograph and examine almost half vis-
   ible face of moon from lunar orbit. Astronauts could leave scientific
   instruments less than 1609 km (1000 mi) from moonâ€™s.south pole, to
   give earth-bound scientists listening post on lunar region that would
    otherwise go unexplored. Surveyor VII photos had shown Tycho
    landing to be strewn with many varieties of rocks. Difficulty with
    Tycho landing was that Apollo crew might have to use so much fuel
    getting to it that they would not have enough to return if they en-
    countered difficulty on approach, Astronaut Charles M. Duke, Jr.,
    said. Donald K. Slayton, MSC Chief of Flight Crew Operations, said
    NASA was studying possibility of Tycho landing: â€œOur position so
    far is that Tycho is a bad place. . . . But, if we can figure the reasona-
    ble way to do it.. .and decide itâ€™s a reasonable place to go, then
    Tycho becomes a candidate for landing.â€
       Descartes, second site favored by scientists, contained relatively
    young volcanic material and also crust on surface away from vol-
    canic highlands that might be as old as moon itself. It was thought to

   be one of two A 0110 sites where moonquakes might be occurring;
                    P
   other was hills o Fra Mauro, Apollo 14 landing site.
      Dr. Alfred E. Ringwood of Australian National Univ. told seminar
   he had concluded from study of Apollo 11 and 12lunar samples that
   moon once had heat source 160-480 km (100-300 mi) beneath surface
   that was emitting 1500 K (2200Â°F) temperatures. Heat had emanated
   from abundance of radioactive minerals in moonâ€™s depths, he pro-
   posed, and partially melted moonâ€™s inner rock, which then flowed to
   lunar surface through pores or forced its way upward as it expand-
   ed where pores did not exist. Upswelling rock, Dr. Ringwood said,
   caused lunar features visible on moonâ€™s face. He speculated that
   moon had lost most of its radioactivity and heat 2 billion yrs earlier.
      Dr. Charles P. Sonnett, ARC scientist, said he had found â€œlittle
   bumpsâ€ of magnetism along lunar surface when studying signals
   from instruments left on moon. Bumps suggested that radioactive
   heat was coming to surface and causing parts of moon to behave as
   if they had magnetic field. Moon was â€œstrong and rigid to depth of
   200 mi (322 km],â€ Dr. Sonnett said, â€œbut I believe that all you need is
   a porosity of about 10 per cent in that crust to have a warmer and
   more plastic material leak to the top.â€
      Dr. Rolf Meisner of Univ. of Hawaii said analysis of data from
   Apollo 12 lunar seismometer led him to believe that moonquakes
   could not be caused by breaks in moonâ€™s crust but were caused by
   warm gases escaping from beneath lunar surface in response to
   earthâ€™s increased gravitational pull. He had recorded 14 moon-
   quakes, all of which seemed to come from about 240 km (150 mi)
   east-southeast of seismometer in Fra Mauro hills, where Apollo 14
   was to land in February 1971.
      Dr. Thomas Gold, Cornel1 Univ. astronomer, argued that lunar
    maria contained dust and not lava. Lack of electrical activity of sur-
   face material and the way Apollo moonquake detectors had reacted
   to tremors and impacts could mean there was deep deposit of pow-
    der. Acoustical signal from Apollo 12 lunar seismometer was â€œcom-
   patible with a deep layer of a very homogenous nature in which the
   speed of sound is uniform.â€ (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 9/12/70, A3; 9/13/70,

      Science by Dr. Foy D. Kohler, former U.S. Ambassador to

      grams had been roughly equal in complexity and in input of re-
      sources. â€œIf, as has been asserted, the U.S. moon undertaking rep-
      resented a task equal in technological complexity to the total of all
      the great tasks performed by man from the building of the pyramids
      through explosion of the atom bomb, hardly less can be said of Sovi-
      et space enterprise.â€ Soviet investment in space program had been
      comparable to that of U S . , â€œif not substantially greater.â€ Both
      programs had depended for success on effective organization and
      use of existing organizations and expertise and both had required
      extensive organizational and administrative innovations and new
      management techniques.In both programs most of basic scientific
      knowledge and technology already existed. Organization and man-
      agement had been complicated by necessity of serving both military
      and nonmilitary objectives and by pressures of diverging national
      interests. Both programs represented â€œorganizational triumphs of a
      high order.â€ Aspect of US. moon landing now generally forgotten
      was â€œthat a number of knowledgeable people were convinced it
      could not be done.â€

      Soviet space effort had had less impact on national economy than
   had U.S. effort. Soviet sources had revealed continuing shortcom-
   ings in computer technology and hardware upon which space pro-
   gram was dependent. Soviet scientists and technologists not directly
   engaged in space program did not receive direct knowledge of space
   programâ€™s technical discoveries and innovations and were denied
   use of research tools and techniques employed. â€œThe Soviets them-
   selves are evidencing increasing agitation over their inability to
   match the United States in transferring â€˜great prestigeâ€™ and â€˜great
   accomplishmentsâ€™ in science and technology to meet the general
   needs of society.â€ Authoritative statement indicated U.S.S.R. in-
   tended to triple space expenditures in next few years, while in U.S.
   â€œprevailing national mood seems to be moving strongly against in-
   vestments for the future in favor of maximum utilization of re-
   sources for the immediate betterment of conditions of life.â€
      This raised question, â€œHas the whole operation represented but
   another highly successful one-shot exercise in crisis management,
   or has it represented incorporation into American society of a new
   way to organize, systematically and purposefully, the development
   and use of scientific and technological resources to the furtherance

   from Baykonur at 6:26 pm local time (9:26 am EDT). Tass said pur-
   pose of mission was to explore moon and near-moon space and re-
   ported all systems were functioning normally.

   km (68.4-1119 altitude. Tass said ground controllers put spacecraft
   into elliptical orbit with 104.6-km (65-mi) apolune and 14.5-km (9-
   mi) perilune. Rocket firing thrust spacecraft toward moon and brak-
   ing rockets were fired 295 m (968 ft) from lunar surface. Main brak-
   ing rockets were shut down 19.8 m (65 ft) above surface and Luna
   XVI softlanded on moonâ€™s Sea of Fertility at 10:18 am Baykonur

    cardinal nee to deprive hijackers of a safe haven. One of the
    scandals of international diplomacy is that the proposed treaty to
    require all countries either to extradite or punish hijackers did not
    go into effect long ago. It would be unwise, however, to await ratifi-
    cation of this treaty by all the countries concerned: airline security
    is too important to wait on national politics. What is required is sus-
    pension of airline services to countries that cannot or will not crack
    down on hijackers. Mr. Nixon calls upon the international commun-
     ity to take â€˜joint actionâ€™ to this end. This. . .does not go far enough.
     The United States should unilaterally suspend air services to of-
     fending countries. By its example and influence, it should constrain
     other governments to follow suit.â€ ( WPost, 9/12/70, A18)

September 14: Dr. Thomas 0. Paine addressed Economic Club of De-
   troit in last public appearance as NASA Administrator. He summa-
   rized NASA projections of potential space advances to year 2000-
   advances U.S., U.S.S.R., Western Europe, and Japan, alone or in
   concert, would have industrial and economic resources to realize.
   For both America and other countries, response to challenge
   would â€œdetermine their futures.â€
       New space transportation system-with reusable space shuttle to
   make return trips to orbit with passengers and cargo, permanent
   orbitin8 space station, and automated and manned space tugs for
   emplacing and recovering satellites and for transportation between
   orbits-was â€œbridge to our future in space.â€ Space shuttle would be
    â€œ N A S A â€™ s major single effort during the next ten years.â€
       New approach to large payloads based on shuttle booster stage
   would off set termination of Saturn V after completion of Apollo
   lunar landings by 1972. Skylab program scheduled to start during
    1973 would provide basis for final design of space station. Integrated
   lunar exploration in early 1980s could use station in lunar orbit as
   platform for descent to any portion of moonâ€™s surface for up to 14
   days. Broad, vigorous, unmanned program to explore planets in
    1970s would be start of orderly program to visit every planet in so-
   lar system, blazing trail for manned trips to Mars and Venus before
   end of century.
       â€œThe space in orbit two hundred miles [320 km] above the earth
    can be thought of as a vast new continent, equal in area to the sur-
    face of the entire globe.â€™â€™ Discovered only a dozen years ago, new
    continent would â€œbecome increasingly important as the leading
    world source of global information and communication services and
    then, inevitably, as a new home of men from earth.â€ Beyond solar
    system, automated and manned astronomical probes would â€œextend
    our understanding of the universe through more intensive investiga-
    tions in optical and radio astronomy and space physics.â€ Before
    centuryâ€™s end, man might find answers to â€œthe overwhelming ques-
    tions of manâ€™s origin, his destiny, and of his uniqueness as the bear-
    er of intelligence in the universe.â€ Man â€œmay indeed be unique-
    but the odds against it approach a thousand billion billion to
    one. . . . Every experiment so far has been negative, but the search
    will continue. . . We do not know what may exist, but we are upon
    the verge of knowing.â€
       Of Apollo program Dr. Paine said, â€œHistory may record that the
    substitution of major international technical competition, in place of
    war, was the great and unprecedented peacekeeping breakthrough
    of our era.â€ Benefit on international social and technical change was
    â€œevident to all.â€ (Text)

  Summary of confidential DOT report on SST to Presidentâ€™s Council on
    Environmental Quality was released to press by â€œqualified
     sources.â€ Report recommended that SST development proceed
     pending study of possible minor harmful effects on environment.
     More research was needed on temperature increases that would be
     caused by water vapor and exhaust from SST; airport noise from SST
    would be higher than desired; and occupants of SST would receive
     radiation doses higher than occupants of subsonic jets flying at low-
     er altitudes. However, SSTâ€™s steep angle of climb should make over-
     all community noise no higher than noise from existing jets. Expo-
     sure of SST passengers and crews to high-altitude radiation would be
     lessened by SSTâ€™S greater speed, which would shorten transit time.
     SST might increase uv radiation reaching earthâ€™s surface and de-
     crease ozone in upper atmosphere, but these effects were â€œinsignifi-
     cantâ€ and within present-day variations. Possible effect on tempera-
     ture from increased water vapor should be of no practical signifi-

0 Introduction to the Solar Wind by John C. Brandt was reviewed in
    Science by Roger A. Kopp of National Center for Atmospheric
    Research. In 1958 it had been argued that sunâ€™s 995800 K
    (1 000 OOOÂ°F) corona must expand continuously into space with su-
    personic velocities near earthâ€™s orbit. Subject had remained in con-
    troversy until 1962 observations from Mariner I I indicated plasma
    outflow from sun with 400-km-per-sec (249-mps) velocities and
    mean particle density of about 10 per cc (0.06 cu in) at orbit of earth.
    â€œThe obvious place to begin a discussion of the solar .w,ind is at the

    set.â€ It would consist of propulsion, living, cargo, and electronic
    control modules and could be â€œput together or broken down to meet
    any immediate need.â€ Tug would be used to land men on moon for
    long-term stays, to push and pull large pieces of space hardware to
    assemble them into space stations or interplanetary vehicles, and
    for astronaut rescue. Tug, launched into orbit aboard shuttle, would
    never return to earth. It was designed for 3-yr, 10-mission lifetime
    and would be chemically re-refueled with oxygen and hydrogen re-
    plenished by tanker shuttle. NASA expected tug to deliver 27 200-
    31 750 kg (60 000-70 000 Ibs) of gear to lunar surface during 28-day

September 22-25: Eurospace, organization of European industries
   concerned with space, sponsored conference on cooperation in
   space in Venice, Italy. The0 Lefevre, Belgian Minister for Scientific
   Policy and Planning and head of European Space Conference, re-
   ported on his Sept. 16-17 negotiations with U.S.Government. He
   confirmed that, in return for European commitment to participate in
   development of space shuttle and related hardware, U.S. would
   launch European spacecraft until shuttle was available. Charge for
   each launch would not exceed cost of rocket and its firing.
       Predominant theme of conference, was that reusable shuttles
   would substantially lessen cost of practical uses of space. There was
   little talk of manned space stations or exploration of other planets.
   Discussions centered on use of satellites for communications, air
   traffic control, and weather forecasting. European public had be-
   come â€œcool to manned space flight,â€ New York Times said. ESRO
   head, Dr. Herman Bondi, said at conference, â€œWe have grown up
   with the impression that everything in space is devilishly expen-
   sive.â€ Belgian aerospace executive Maurice Desirant said European
   efforts at joint space programs had been handicapped by pressures
   to perform national feats. Now, however, European countries had
   become â€œmore and more aware of the dangers.â€ They had seen
    money wasted on duplicated efforts which had achieved limited re-
    sults.
       Lefevre said that, to be effective, European contribution to major
    space effort must be under leadership strong enough to override any
    differences arising from â€œdivergent technical points of view, rea-
    sons of industrial competition, economic whims for national politics
    or finances.â€

0 Cause of July 23 failure of ion engine on board orbiting Sert II had
    been identified and could be prevented in future, LeRc announced.
    Project Manager Raymond J. RuliS said beam from neutralizer had
    eroded and broken off small piece of metal from one of two grids at
    back of engine. Metal, attracted by forces of electric field between
    screen grid and accelerator grid, had been welded between grids by
    high voltages and had caused short circuit that shut down grid power
    lines. Although damaged thruster on Sert II could not be repaired,
    erosion problem could be prevented in future by relocating neutral-
    izer and redirecting its beam to eliminate localized wear on grid.
       Second ion engine on board Sert II was operating satisfactorily
    after more than 1300 hrs. Engine would be shut down in late No-

    ciple, all our energy needs could be met for a long time with coal,
   This raw material could be processed to yield sulfur-free fuel, liquid
    hydrocarbons, and methane. In practice, however, the development
    of the use of coal is limping along and is underfinanced. A few
   hundred million dollars a year devoted to research, development,

    mud.â€ Later New York Times said lzvestia correspondent Konova-
    Iov had been permitted to observe lunar material at special Soviet
    Academy of Sciences laboratory in Moscow, where initial examina-
   tion was taking place. Exact location of laboratory and names of top
   officals in Luna XVIprogram were being kept secret.
       Konovalov had reported container of samples had been placed in
    cylindrical stainless steel chamber with portholes. Pumps had
    sucked oxygen from chamber and sterilizing gas had been injected.
    Chamber had been filled with helium gas to prevent reaction with
    moon samples. Then container, which included moon rock and its
   electrical drill, had been opened for observation. Rock had been
    placed on steel trough containing scale divisions. Some material
    would be taken in special bags to other laboratories for examination.
    Konovalovâ€™s reference to lunar â€œdustâ€ had been first use of term by
    Soviet journalist, New York Times said. Previous references had
    been to â€œlunar surface,â€ â€œlunar ground,â€ or â€œlunar rock.â€

   modes, and meteorological conditions; developing remote monitor-
   ing technique for trailing-vortex position and wind intensity; and
   discouraging formation of high-density vortices by aircraft design or
   artificially induced impedances.
      Theoretical descriptions of trailing-vortex-system behavior would
   be developed from flight-test. programs at FRC and LaRC. ARC was
   experimenting with wing design to reduce trailing-vortex intensity
   and with effects of induced impedances near aircraft path. MSFC was

    Transition of World War I1 aircraft industry into 1970 aerospace in-
0
      dustry was traced in Air Force magazine by Karl G. Harr, Jr., AIA
     President. Increased performance had increased complexity. Aver-
      age 1944 combat aircraft had carried 454 kg (% ton) of avionic gear;
      1948-1950 counterpart needed three to five times as much.
         Weapon revolution did not signify end of manned aircraft era; it
      brought forth â€œnew family of aircraft of substantially improved
     capability.â€ First operational â€œbarely supersonicâ€ 1954 fighter had
     been followed by succession of more advanced fighters. â€œThe com-
      plexity curve took a sharp upward turn, taking the cost curve with
     it,â€ with corollary decline in numbers of aircraft roduced. Fewer
                                                         r?
     aircraft were needed because of individual aircra tâ€™s superior per-
     formance.
         With advent of supersonic aircraft production, guided missile
      output became significant portion of industry workload. Big push
     had come in 1954 when missile procurement topped billion-dollar
      level for first time.
         â€œUndoubtedly, the space program was the dominant influence in
     historyâ€™s most explosive decade of technological advance. There
     were two rimary contributing factors: breadth and acceleration.â€
     Breadth o r program required continual probing of new research
     frontiers across spectrum of almost every scientific and technologi-
     cal discipline. â€œThe acceleration of effort imposed by the lunar-
     landing timetable necessitated a forcing of technology, compressing
     into one decade the normal advance of several.â€ (AF, 9/70,84-8)

   Federal funds for R&D reached peak $16.5 billion in 1967, $15.6 bil-
   lion in 1969, and were expected to remain same in 1970 and 1971. In
   terms of constant dollars, 1970 estimate was 17% decrease from
    1967. Of Federal total, $1.4 billion was provided to universities and
   colleges in 1969 for support of academic research, with $1.5 billion
   expected in 1971. Basic research obligations had leveled off since
    1967, remaining at $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. NASA was leading basic
   research supporter, accounting for 35% of 1970 total.
      Applied research obligations remained at about $3.3-billion fund-
    ing level from 1967 through 1970, with rise to $3.7 billion projected
   for 1971 subject to congressional actions. In constant dollars, fund-
   ing decreased 11% from 1967 to 1970. DOD, HEW, and NASA ac-
    counted for 79% of Federal agency total in 1970. From 1964 to 1970

   Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers and program officers gave
    status of programs, plans for 1970s, and studies leadinginto 1980s.
       Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Director, announced
   selection of Hadley-Apennine site for lunar landing of Apollo 15,
   scheduled for launch July 25, 1971. Site, cut by large gorge along
   base of mountains, was 3â€ east of moonâ€™s center and 25â€ north of
   lunar equator on edge of Sea of Rains. Apollo 15 crew would collect
   material from base of Apennine Mountains, examine Hadley Rille
   area, sample fresh-looking mare and volcanic-like features, and de-
   ploy ALSEP. Apollo 16 would be launched in January 1972 and Apol-
   lo 17, in June 1972. High-priority landing sites were Copernicus,
   Davy, Descartes, and Marius Hills.
       To improve CSM return capability in emergencies after landing on
   moon, an LM descent battery and third tank would be added to A ol-
                                                                     B

       Douglas R. Lord, Deputy Director of Space Station Task Force,
   described plans for 12-man space station weighing 49 985-54 400 kg
   (110 000-120 000 Ibs) that could remain in earth orbit for up to 10 yrs.
       Richard J. Allen of Space Shuttle Task Force said NASA was de-
   veloping plans for shuttle with 100-mission reusable capability.
    Myers said DOD was â€œvery much involvedâ€ with shuttle activities.
    â€œWe have a joint committee operating with the Air Force. . .for
    continuous communication and review of requirements.â€ He saw
    â€œpossibility of international cooperation on certain flights and
    [U.S.] military use of the vehicle on others.â€ Myers said he had dis-
    cussed with European officials possibility of participation in space
    shuttle program on three levels: orbit-to-orbit space tug, â€œcleanly
    separable and easily interfaced piece of equipmentâ€ that would
    probably be managed by European consortium and financed with
    European dollars; subcontracts from American companies to Euro-
    pean contractors without transfer of American money; and use of
    technological contributions from European national space activities
    and national aircraft establishments. (Transcript; NASA Release 70-

    DOT center functioned â€œreasonably well.â€ All but 85 former ERC
    employees had jobs; NASA had programs and equipment it needed.
    DOT had ample equipment for new center and 27 universities were
    pursuing new work relevant to NASA interest. â€œMost important, the

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1970

      Dr. Charles A. Berry, MSC Director of Medical Operations, and
   Prof. Oleg G. Gazenko, Director of Soviet Institute of Biomedical
   Problems, said selection of crews for longer space missions would
   require special personality testing to identify persons of more domi-
   nant type for assignment of roles compatible with that trait. Dr. Ber-
   ry said he thought use of multinational flight crews was good idea
   but chances for Orbiting International Laboratory (OIL) in near fu-
   ture seemed slim because of problems of language, attitudes, and
   prejudices such as food preferences. â€œWe canâ€™t have a restaurant
   with a very large menu.â€ In interview, Dr. Berry and Prof. Gazenko
   discussed flashes of light experienced by astronauts in space with
   eyes closed or in darkened spacecraft. Dr. Berry believed flashes
   might be produced by heavy cosmic ray particles-atomic nuclei of
   intermediate weight-that produced ionization in eye retina, affect-
   ed nervous system, or caused light flashes within eye fluid. Dr. Ga-
   zenko said heavy cosmic rays were insufficiently frequent to ac-
   count for flashes. Soviet cosmonauts had not experienced phenome-
   non. (Sullivan, NYT, 10/12/70, 19)
      Cosmonauts Andrian G. Nikolayev and Vitaly I. Sevastyanov
   said muscles of Soyuz IX crew were so atrophied after June 2-19
   mission that they stood up with difficulty and walked with peculiar
   stamping steps. On landing they were so weak that ground crew had
   to assist them from hatch. Sensation of heaviness lasted 10 to 11
   days. Crew had performed antiatrophy exercises during mission but
   more intensive exercise program might be needed for flights to other
   planets, with simulation of gravity included. Cosmonauts felt effects
   of weightlessness were not dangerous unless experienced for more
   than one month. Soyuz IX cosmonauts displayed photos of June 2
   launch and colored films taken inside spacecraft during 18-day orbit.
   Nikolayev said cosmonauts had slept with head down before
   launch, to become accustomed to rush of blood to head that had
   bothered previous cosmonauts and astronauts on early part of
   flights. Soyuz spacecraft had three sections: orbital module in which
   cosmonauts slept, exercised, and played chess; central module with
   three windows and couches for use in liftoff and reentry; and third
   module containing service equipment. Both orbital and service
   modules were jettisoned before reentry. (Sullivan, NYT, 10/10/70)
      Indian government scientists H. G. S. Murthy, E. V. Chirnis,
   and K. S. Karnik urged U.S. and U.S.S.R. to share economic
   benefits of space exploration with developing nations. â€œInternation-
   al cooperation in global planning of assistance for the operation of
   meteorological communications and navigation satellites will go a
   long way in helping developing countries. National space programs
   in developing countries are not a luxury, but a necessity.â€ (Bene-

       Herbert Schaefer and Dr. Jack W. Wild of NASA Advanced
   Manned Missions program said space rescue vehicles would have to
   be versatile, with several payloads kept at hand to deal with variety
   of emergencies. Standardized docking system would be needed on
   all future manned spacecraft to permit rescue by any nation. NASA
   Assistant Safety Director Philip H. Bolger said, â€œThe rescue of
   stranded astronauts is a concern recognized by all nations and there-
   fore provides a common base for establishing international coopera-
   tion.â€ It was too late to develop rescue system for four remaining
   Apollo flights, but reliability of Apollo spacecraft was being im-
   proved. Bolger said Skylab three-man space station scheduled for
   1972 launch might have double rotection-spacecraft that could be
                                     K
   separated and returned to eart and standby rescue rocket at KSC.

       LeRoy E. Day, Manager of NASA Space Shuttle Task Group, de-
   scribed system characteristics of space shuttle: â€œIt should be a fully
   reusable two-stage vertical take-off and horizontal landing space
    vehicleâ€ that could transport 11 340 kg (25 000 Ibs) to the design refer-
   ence orbit of 500 km (310 mi) at 55â€ orbital inclination. Shuttle
   â€œmust have a large internal cargo bay which will give it the capabili-
   ty of carrying a variety of manned and unmanned payloads to low
   earth orbit. The large internal payload compartment will allow the
   shuttle to deliver to low earth orbit both a satellite and a high energy
   stage for a synchronus orbit or a planetary mission. We expect the
   gross lift-otf weight. . .to be approximately 1.6 million kilograms
    [3.5 million Ibs] fully fueled and with the payload on-board.â€ Rock-
    et engines would be one of most critical subsystems â€œFor both the
   booster and the orbiter we will use high pressure hydrogenloxygen
   rocket engines which can be throttled to keep the acceleration dur-
   ing ascent to less than 3 gâ€™s.â€ (Text)
       Dr. George E. Mueller, General Dynamics Corp. Vice President
   and former NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight,
   said U.S. space shuttle could be â€œgolden transportâ€ to carry pas-
   sengers between any two cities on earth in an hour in 1980s. Shuttle
   could be converted easily to transport flying to 130-km (80-mi) alti-
   tude and plunging back to target city at approximately 18 500 km per
   hr (11 500 mph). Rocket-boosted aircraft would take off vertically,
    eliminating noise problem. Other nations might purchase U.S. shut-
    tle for $50 million. (AP, B Sun, 10/10/70, A3)

      Seaborg, AEC Chairman, at Fourth International Con erence on Plu-
      tonium and Other Actinides in Santa Fe, N. Mex. Most noteworthy
      use of plutonium-238-powered, radioisotope thermoelectric genera-
      tor (RTG) had been as SNAP-27, power source for Apoilo 12
      experimental package left on moon. RTGâ€™s   were â€œof particular interest
      as space electric power sources for missions requiring a long life and
      high reliability, where there are long periods of darkness or great
      distance from the sun, or where orientation or other problems tend
      to reduce the effectiveness of solar cells as an energy source.â€ Sig-
      nificant number of future space missions might require plutonium
      238 power source.
         Element â€œfinds another extremely important use in space as the
      power source for waste disposal.â€ Heat from plutonium 238 decay
      would both produce bacteria-free drinking water from waste prod-
      ucts and incinerate waste itself. After Apollo, exploration of moon
      might continue with robot vehicles. â€œThe maintenance and servic-
      ing of space stations and NERVA engines in space may be done more
      easily and safely by robots than by man. . . . Nuclear power would
      be an obvious candidate power system.â€™â€™ (Text)

0
      New York. Dr. Frederick Seitz, President of Rockefeller Univ.,
      received Karl Taylor Compton Award for distinguished statesman-
       ship in science.
         During interview following meeting Dr. William D. McElroy ,NSF
       Director, said NSF had begun testing use of large teams of scientists
      from different disciplines under Federal funding as new approach to
       basic scientific research. .NSF had allocated $70 million in 1970 for
       studies of pressing national and social matters.
         Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner, MITProvost and science adviser to Presi-
       dent Kennedy, said prioritites had been misplaced. He advocated a
       national science policy. â€œIf I invented a new military system to stop
       tanks, I could get $100 million at the snap of my fingers. But if I say
       we want to develop a new method of medical care, I donâ€™t know if I
       could raise $10 million.â€
         Dr. Harvey Brooks, Harvard Univ. Dean of Engineering, said:
       â€œThe central problem is how science can be reasonably responsive
       to social problems without destroying itself as science. The health
       of science depends on its capacity to develop its own intellectual
       laws. If it attempts to become too responsive, it loses its integrity,
       and I see a danger of that happening now.â€ (Reinhold, NYT, 10/6/

     Dr. Thomas Gold of Cornell Univ. Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.)
      said, â€œI want to shift spending from space extravaganzas to needy

      nation than it has to date.â€ Both Senators, with Sen. Jacob K. Javits
     (R-N.Y .) and Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.), favored continua-
      tion of four remaining Apollo flights and three-mission Skylab pro-
     gram but called for ending manned flight on their completion. Dr.
      Van Allen advocated unmanned space program after Skylab that
      would devote two thirds of its funds to direct applications of space
      with remainder devoted to â€œscientific experiments to examine the
      solar system.â€ Dr. Gold said, â€œIf we fritter awa our limited re-
      sources on unwanted further demonstrations o[ manned flights
      [U.S.S.R.] may, with much smaller means, get way ahead in all the
      areas that really count.â€ He predicted that, if space station was

    Discovery of tektite glass in Apollo 12 sample 12013, reported June
0
     5th by GSFC scientist Dr. John A. Oâ€™Keefe, was debated in Science
      by Dr. Oâ€™Keefe, Univ. of Houston geologist Elbert A. King, Jr.,
      and LRL scientists R. Martin and Weldon B. Nance.
         Analyses of sample by King, Martin, and Nance had led them to
      conclude that â€œthere is no existing chemical or mineralogical ob-
      servation or data that uniquely support the idea that tektites origi-
      nate from the moon. There are abundant chemical data that support
      a close genetic relationship between tektites and terrestrial rock
      materials. These data have been presented or summarized by nu-
      merous authors. Tektite glass has not been found in samples from
      Apollo 12 (or Apollo 1 I).â€
         Dr. Oâ€™Keefe responded: â€œThey find that the material is crystalline
      rather than glassy. The crystals are, however, evidently rather fine;
      from statistical considerations it can be judged that the agreement of
      the two major-element analyses given for samples of only a few tens
      of millograms is likely only if the crystals are of the order of 1OOp m
      [0.04 in] or smaller in diameter. This raises the question whether
      they are the products of devitrefication. In any case, the former ex-
      istence of a liquid of this composition seems to be implied. Evidence
      of somewhat similar liquids was found in the Apollo 11 sample.â€

      restrial basalt. The low conductivity and increased efficiency of in-
      sulating crusts on lunar lavas will enable flows to cover great dist-
     ances without being quenched by high radiant heat losses from the
      surface. For a given rate of heat production, the thermal gradient of

October 20-27: Zond VIII automatic space station was launched by
   U.S.S.R. from Baykonur and placed on lunar trajectory. Tass,
   breaking traditional secrecy surrounding Soviet space missions,
   announced launch and said purpose was â€œto carry out physical re-
    search along the flight path and the near-moon space, take pictures
   of the lunar surface, of the earth and the moon at different dis-
   tances, check on improved on-board systems, units and the con-,
   struction of the spacecraft. Under the flight program Zond 8 will
   round the moon on Oct. 24, then change to an eastward path and
   return to earth on Oct. 27.â€
      On Oct. 24 Tass announced that Zond VIII had circled within
   1120 km (696 mi) of moon, studied space, photographed moon, and
   was returning to earth. Spacecraft splashed down in Indian Ocean
   Oct. 27 and was recovered by Soviet vessel T a m . Tass said space-
   craft brought back â€œextremely important photographs needed for
   studies of the geological and morphological qualities of the moon.â€

     its intrinsic value, sets the pace for much of the technological devel-
     opment of this country and promises to do so for the foreseeable
     future. . . . We do not believe that we could long survive and pros-
     per without this preeminent technological position. Therefore, we
     have to stand and fight off the stampede by other groups to acquire
     funds now being channeled into our national technology through
     NASA and the Department of Defense. It is a veritable â€˜run on the

    blobs of electrically charged gas out of earth-orbiting satellite. He
    told 1970 Meeting of Interagency Conference on Weather Modifica-
    tion at Virginia Beach, Va., NOAA would fly simple experiment on
    small geophysical monitoring satellite. â€œWhen activated 22 300
    miles [35 900 km] above the nighttim? earth, the device will trigger a
    self-quenching flow of electrons into the upper atmosphere. Our
    proposed experiment in modifying space weather requires interact-
    ing with our environment in a scientifically significant yet totally
    non-destructive way .â€ If initial release of plasma from satellite
    caused artificial aurora scientists would â€œbe able to deduce the ex-
    act shape of the magnetic field line that passes through the satelliteâ€™s
    position. In addition, the. . .experiment should provide information
    on diffusion of plasma along field lines, diffusion across field lines,
    and electric fields deep in the magnetosphere.â€
       Naturally occurring electron-precipitation events were accompa-
    nied by many terrestrial effects, including auroral displays, radio-
    propagation disturbances, and intense, short-lived fluctuations of
    earthâ€™s magnetic field. If NOAA experiment enhanced precipitation
    from magnetosphere into ionosphere scientists â€œwould then be
    more certain of the natural processes that cause storms and should
    be able to improve our predictions of radar clutter and the quality of
    polar radio communications in future, naturally occurring storms.

    Johnson. NASAâ€™s Itos I , launched Jan. 23, was in sun-synchronous
    orbit. Operational sounding capability would be added to system in
     1972. Third-generation operational satellite was planned for 1975
    launch. Synchronous Meteorological Satellite scheduled for 1972
    launch would be operational prototype of Geostationary Operation-
    al Environmental Satellite that would complement Itos I . Initially,
    U.S. would keep one geostationary spacecraft operating continu-
    ously. It was hoped second would be launched before first GARP
    global experiment scheduled for one-year period about 1976.
       France and Japan were considering synchronous satellites for first
    GARP global experiment. ESRO and U.K. might build polar-orbit
    meteorological satellites for experiment. U.S.S.R. was operating
    meteorological satellites in quasi-polar orbit and was developing
    sounding instruments. Space-based observing system apparently
    would furnish major portion of data for GARP global experiment, by
    which time â€œU.S. operational meteorological satellite system will
    approach the coverage needed, except for the four synchronous
    satellites. Promising signs of significant contributions towards these
    have come from other countries.â€ (A&A, 10/70,28-32)

   der any circumstances. But the timing of last weekâ€™s [Oct. 26-27]
   agreement aimed at standardizing both nationsâ€™ space
    ships. . .makes that development doubly welcome. The talks SUC-
   ceeded when most aspects of Washington-Moscow relations are

    imprisonment in Russia of two American generals whose plane
    strayed across the Turkish border.â€ ( N Y T , 11/2/70)

    long road which still lies ahead before America and Russia have
    peacefully resolved all their major disagreements, we see the new
    space pact as an extraordinary heartening development. It has creat-
    ed a new bond, a new mutual interest, a new feeling of joint partici-
    pation. It is from the muliplication of such ties that international
    peace and friendship grow. And from such a vision of space togeth-

   lunar scientists headed by Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal seismic
   investigator for Apollo program, made report. Unusually long rever-
    berations suggested â€œthat the lunar mare in the region of the Apo!lo
    12 landing site consists of material with ver low selsmlc velocities
                                                K
   near the surface with velocity increasing wit. depth to 5 to 6 kilome-

    20 kilometers [12.4 mi]. Absorption o seismic waves in this struc-
   ture is extremely low relative to typical continental crustal materials
   on earth. It is unlikely that a major boundary similar to the crust-
    mantle interface on earth exists in the outer 20 kilometers E12.4 mi]
    of the moon. A combination of dispersion and scattering of surface
    waves iplplies the presence of heterogeneity within the outer zone
    of the mare on a scale of from several hundred meters (or less) to
    several kilometers. Seismic signals from 160 events of natural origin
    have been recorded during the first 7 months of operation of the

November 9: Ofo Orbiting Frog Otolith and secondary payload, RM
   Radiation/Meteoroid satellite, were successfullv launched by NASA
   from Wallops Station at 1:OO am EST by four-stage Scout booster.

   528-km (328-mi) apogee, 299.7-km (186.4-mi) perigee, 92.8-min peri-
   od, and 37.4â€ inclination. Countdown had been aborted five times
   since original August launch date because of bad weather, instru-
   ment malfunctions, and death of frogs.
      Primary objective of 132.5-kg (292-1b) Ofo was to obtain informa-
   tion on functioning and adaptability in weightlessness of vestibule,
   portion of inner ear which controlled balance, by studying two male
   bullfrogs ( R a m castebianca) on board. Through microelectrodes
   surgically implanted in vestibular nerves leading from sensor cells in
   frogsâ€™ otholiths, scientists would be able to study for the first time
   electrical response of otolith sensors under weightlessness and sim-
   ulated gravity provided by centrifuge for at least three days, Frogs
   had been chosen for flight because their inner ear mechanism func-
   tiwed similarly to manâ€™s and because they were small and amphi-
   bious. Onboard spacecraft they were submerged in water with oxy-
   gen composition controlled by instruments. After several hours In
   orbit frogs were in good condition and spacecraft was transmitting
   data satisfactorily.
      Primary objective of 21-kg (46-lb) RMsatellite was to demonstrate
   feasibility and accuracy of advanced radiation dosimeter concept in
    space and to verify, in flight, operation of instruments to be used on
    long-duration flights to study meteoroids for at least three months.

                                             f
   size of small automobile with eight spoke wheels apparently pow-
   ered by solar energy and batteries. Tass said Lunokhod I carried
   flags and pennants with Soviet coat of arms and Leninâ€™s bas relief
   and was equipped with scientific apparatus, instruments and control
   systems, and radio and TV devices. Lunokhod f left Luna XVII
   descent stage at 11:28 am Baykonur time (1:28 am EST) Nov. 17 by
   special gangway and traveled 20 m (66 ft) from spacecraft to begin
   experiments. Tass said vehicleâ€™s movement could be controlled au-
   tomatically or by ground controllers following televised information
   on position and character of surrounding lunar surface.
      Between Nov. 17 and Nov. 22, 10 radio and TV sessions were
   held and large amount of data was transmitted. Chemical composi-
   tion of surface layer of lunar soil was analyzed with x-ray spectro-
   meter and mechanical properties of lunar soil and transportability of
   vehicle were investigated. .In addition, Tass said, â€œan instrument
   was used which has a punch for soil intrusion, and a system of sen-
   sors for measuring forces acting on the wheels.â€ Panoramic pic-
   tures of lunar landscape were taken, in which tracks made by Lu-
   nokhod I, details of lunar surface, and parts of vehicle were clearly
   visible. Tass said TV cameras, â€œdesigned for surveying and evaluat-
   ing the route traveled, provided the necessary information for travel
   in the conditions of uneven, broken terrain. At some points. . .the
   incline reached 14 deg. Along the path, Lunokhod encount-
   ered. . .deep craters the detours to which were ensured byithe oper-
   ators (on Earth).â€
      On Nov. 22, after five days on lunar surface, Lunokhod I was
   commanded to terminate operations in preparation for lunar night.
   Tass said vehicle had competed â€œa complex of tests. . .and a wide
   program of tests of its mobilityâ€ and had traveled 197 m (646 ft).
   Vehicle was moved to an â€œassigned positionâ€ where it would re-
   main stationary during lunar night and solar panels were closed.
      Luna XVIl was first unmanned spacecraft to land on moon and
   deploy automatic lunar explorer. Last mission in series, unmanned

  Pros and cons of SST debate were cited by David Hoffman in Washing-

    of the American economy.â€ Environmentalists agreed aircraft
    might generate 50 000 jobs, improve balance of trade, and guarantee
    U.S. leadership in commercial aviation, but said nothing would jus-
    tify â€œadditional noise irritation and risk to manâ€™s surroundings.â€ SST

     VI and VII in wide-range solar orbit using precise distance-measur-
    ing system and 64-m (210-ft) Goldstone antenna. Experiments tested
    validity of theory that velocity of light was slower in gravitational
   field near sun than in interplanetary space where gravitational fields
    were weaker. â€œOur experiments to date show that Einsteinâ€™s predic-
   tions are right, to within 2 to 4 per cent. The best measurements we
   have thus far indicate a maximum delay of about 204 microseconds
   for Mariner VI, as compared with an expected 200 microseconds
   using Einsteinâ€™s theory.â€ Findings cast doubt on more recent theo-
   ries of Dr. Charles Brans and Dr. Robert H. Dicke that Einsteinâ€™s
   formulations could be incorrect by 7% â€œIf the Brans-Dicke theory
    were correct, the time delay would be much less.. .perhaps about

     10% titanium dioxide; all soil and rocks from Ocean of Storms and
     Sea of Fertility contained under 5%. Dr. Gast said Sea of Fertility
     sample provided 50% additional data to that known previously on

     was held at NASA Hq. Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Direc-
     tor, said first anniversary of ALSEP was â€œscientific and technological
     triumph. The design specification was for one lunar day and night.
     Our design goal was for one calendar year.â€ Year after deployment
     ALSEP had received and processed over 6500 commands, had under-
    gone 2600 533-K (500Â°F) swings of temperature, and was still being
     operated remotely 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week.

        Astronaut Alan L. Bean said unmanned vehicle, such as
     U.S.S.R.â€™s Lunokhod I, could not explore surfack as well as men
     could because men could deploy more equipment more effectively,
     pprform more experiments, and collect more samples. He noted that
     Apollo 11 had collected 22.7 kg (50 Ibs) of samples; Apollo 12, 34 kg
     (75 Ibs); and Luna XVI, 90 g (0.2 Ib).
        Dr. Gary V. Latham of Columbia Univ.â€™s Lamont-Doherty Geo-
     logical Laboratory said seismic events were being recorded at rate
     of about one per day; some were impacts from grapefruit-size me-
     teoroids and some appeared to be small moonquakes. In region of
      Apollo 12 station there were at least nine places at which moon-
     quakes occurred â€œevery month at or near the time when the moon
     comes closest to earth in its monthly orbital cycle.â€ Most active
     zone for moonquakes was about 193 km (120 mi) southeast of AL-
      SEP, near rilles in Fra Mauro crater, Apollo 14 landing site.
        Dr. Charles P. Sonett of ARC said data indicated moonâ€™s tempera-
     ture increased very slowly with depth below surface, probably ris-
     ing no higher than 1273 K (1332â€F)-too cool for molten core char-
     acteristic of volcanic body.
         Dr. Conway M. Snyder of JPL described behavior of thin cloud of
      ionized gas detected after ascent stage was crashed into moon. Solar
      wind of ionized particles should have blown the gas downwind; it
      traveled upwind and was detected by ALSEP instruments. Cause of
      acceleration of the particles was unknown. (Transcript; Schmeck,

   trolyzed to yield oxygen and hydrogen. Calculations showed proc-
   ess could produce 0.5 kg (1 lb) of water from 45.4 kg (100 Ibs) of lu-

Washington Post editorial commented on Soviet Lunokhod I: â€œThe
   appearance of this vehicle, as well as the landing on the moon and
   return to earth of Luna 16, makes it clear that the Russians hope to
    regain some of the prestige they lost in the race to land men on the
    moon. ... In terms of the American space prcgram, this new suc-
   cess of the Russians should have little impact other than to persuade
   the administration and Congress not to cut back its funds any fur-
    ther. There is no logical reason for NASA to go like gang-busters in
    an effort to match the Russians in unmanned space exploration since
    the decision has already been made to proceed with a scaled down
    and more rational space program. The first big trophy in space activ-
    ities went to the Russians, the most recent big one to the Americans,
    and it is reasonable to suspect that future ones will be divided be-
    tween the two nations.â€ ( W Post, 11/20/70, A261
  Science editorial commented on comsats: The communications satel-
    lites have a variety of applications. . . . One application that will
    probably be implemented fairly soon is aeronautical and shjg com-
   mun-ication. Radio works well on line of sight but 1s undependable
    at distances greater than 300 miles [483 km]. Many ships have been
    lost while radio operators were trying in vain to communicate their
    peril. Midocean aeronautical navigation represents another growing
    need which could also be filled. Satellite enthusiasts point to other
    potential uses. One of these is Picturephone, which now requires
    about 100 telephone circuits for a single two-way conversation.
    High-capacity; low-cost satellite circuits would help to make feasi-
    ble large-scale use of this device. Perhaps more distant but of great

November 25: NASAâ€™s M2-F3 lifting-body vehicle, piloted by NASA test
    pilot William H. Dana, completed fourth flight-and first powered
    flight-from FRC. Objectives were to expand flight envelope to mach
    0.8, check out engine operation, obtain stability and control data at
    mach 0.8, investigate lateral phugoid present on second flight but
    not on third, check reaction control operation, and investigate land-
    ing visibility. Engine shut down prematurely, after launch from B-52
    aircraft, precluding completion of all planned maneuvers. Investiga-
    tion was under way. (NASA Proj O f  f)
  Significance of Soviet flights to moon was discussed by Dr. George M .
    Low, Acting NASA Administrator, in letter to Sen. Clinton P. Ander-
    son (D-N. Mex.), Chairman of Senate Committee on Aeronautical
    and Space Sciences. Luna XVI and XVII, launched Sept. 12 and
    Nov. 10, had been â€œtechnically impressive; but as isolated events,
    their importance to science and technology is relatively minor.â€
    U.S. still held technological leadership with Apollo 1 1 . U.S. had had
    four men on moon and U.S.S.R. none. U.S. had returned 56 kg (123
    lb) of lunar material and U.S.S.R. had returned 85-113 g (3-4 oz).
    U.S. had placed automated station on moon that had functioned for
    more than year. U.S. had gained â€œenormous amountâ€ of lunar in-
    formation; U.S.S.R. had added very little.
       In overall trends, however, U.S. launch rate was decreasing while
    Soviet rate was increasing. In 1970 to date, U.S.S.R. had placed 74
    payloads in space, to 31 by U.S. â€œThey have seldom missed a
    launch window in the exploration of Venus and Mars; our planetary
    program has many gaps.â€ U.S.S.R. had continuing manned space
    program and capability, with Zond spacecraft, for manned circum-
    lunar flight. Soviets had stated intention to orbit space station before
    U.S. and reportedly were developing booster of Saturn V class
    while U.S. had suspended Saturn V production. U.S.S.R. was
    spending more money on space annually than U.S. â€œ. . .when we
    view Luna 16 and 17 in the context of trends in our program and
    theirs, then we must be concerned about our future in aeronautics
    and space-about our position of leadership that we have worked so
    hard to achieve.â€ (CR, 11/30/70, S19002)

November 29; Observations of more than 100 000 photos of 21 satel-
   lites made from 19 cameras and tracking stations of Smithsonian
   Astrophysical Observatory had shown that satellites bobbed and
   dipped slightly in earth orbit, New York Times reported. Erratic
   motions were caused by variations in earthâ€™s gravitational field. Sat-
   ellites were attracted and pulled downward more as they passed
   over high areas and attracted less over low areas. Scientists had
   concluded that if earth were round orbits would be perfectly ellipti-
   cal. Instead, bulges and depressions covered earth in two bands-
   high band with neck across North Pole and ends stretching over
   Europe and West Africa on one side and Pacific Ocean on other; low

    conference: â€œI have satisfied myself, after long deliberation. . .that
    the arguments with regard to the environment could be met, that this
    prototype should be built. What is involved here is not just 150,000
    jobs which will be lost if we donâ€™t build it, not just the fact that bil-
    lions of dollars in foreign exchange will be lost if we do not build it;
    but, what is lost here is the fact that the United States of America
    which has been first in the world in commercial aviation from the
    time of the Wright Brothers decides not just to be second but not
    even to show.â€ (PD, 12/14/70, 1652)
* House Committee on Science and Astronautics published The Nation-
    al Space Program-Present and Future, compilation of papers pre-
    pared for Subcommittee on NASA Oversight. Papers represented at-
    titudes of Government, aerospace industry, and academic commun-
    ity on objectives of national space program during next decade and
    funding level needed to support program. Statements had been pre-
    pared for hearings, originally scheduled for September and October
    1970, that had been canceled because of press of legislative business
    and â€œuncertain status of the NASA appropriation measureâ€ for FY
    1971 because of Presidential veto.
       Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASAAdministrator, had urged that
    â€œnew initiatives proposed for the 1970s represent not only a space
    program that will maintain our Nationâ€™s leadership, but also an op-
    portunity to utilize resources which will otherwise remain idle or
    grossly underemployed. In this sense the â€˜real costâ€™ to the society of
    NASAâ€™s programs for the 1970s is very low and the cost-benefit of
    these programs correspondingly high.â€
       Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, Vice president and Group Executive of
    General Electric Co. and former NASA Administrator, said in state-
    ment that U.S.-U.S.S.R. discussion on common spacecraft docking
    had been â€œexcellent step forwardâ€ in space programming. â€œThe
    United States, Western Europe, Australia, Canada, and Japan
    should also work more closely together in the forefront of space sci-
    ence and technology, eliminating duplicative projects and obsoles-
    cent developments for purely nationalistic purposes. Space activi-
    ties are inherently global; they challenge us to develop new interna-
    tional institutions as advanced as our technologies. Attractive new
    international arrangements should also be established for the devel-
    oping nations to help them take full advantage for new application
    opportunities.â€™â€™
       Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator
    for Planning, urged vigorous space program with space shuttle as

December f2: Uhuru (Explorer XLII) (SAS-A) Small Astronomy Satellite
    was launched for NASA by Italy at 1:45 pm local time (5:45 am EST)
   from San Marco launch platform off coast of Kenya. Four-stage
    Scout launch vehicle boosted 142.9-kg (3 15-Ib) satellite into orbit

    period, and 3.04â€ inclination. Primary objective was to develop ca-
    talog of celestial x-ray sources by systematic scanning of sky in 2- to
    20-kev range.
       Satellite-first equippeed with sensitive instruments to detect
    high-energy x-ray sources in space-would pinpoint location of x-
    ray sources; transmit data on intensity, frequency, and time varia-
    tion; and map diffuse x-ray background. NASA controllers would
    maneuver satellite from ground by energizing electromagnet in at-
    titude control system. Electrical energy caused electromagnet to act
    like compass needle, aligning itself to north-south lines of earthâ€™s
    magnetic field and permitting controllers to point spacecraft to any
    direction.

December 12: Uhuru (Explorer XLII) Small Astronomy Satellite was launched into an
equatorial orbit by Italy fron the San Marco launch platform off the coast of Kenya, East
Africa, on Kenyaâ€™s Independence Day. â€œUhuruâ€ was the Swahili word for â€œfreedom.â€
Boosted by a four-stage Scout vehicle to map x-ray sources both within and beyond the
Milky Way Galaxy, the satellite was the first launched for the United States by another
country. At left Mrs. Marjorie Townsend, project manager, discussed satellite perform-
ance with a colleague during preflight tests at Goddard Space Flight Center.

        During first day of operation Uhuru was expected to collect more
     data than had been obtained with sounding rockets in past. eight
     years. Satelliteâ€™s long observing time, rather than the few minutes
     for sounding rockets. would permit observation of x-ray sources
     from 30 to 50 times fainter than those observed thus far, probably
     increasing number of observed x-ray sources from 540 to several
     hundred.
        Uhuru was first in series of three explorers in Small Astronomy
     Satellite program to survey sky above earthâ€™s atmosphere and iden-
     tify x-ray, gamma-ray, UV, and infrared sources. It was first U.S.
     satellite launched by another country. Under NASA and Univ. of
     Rome agreement NASA provided booster and satellite; Italian
     team, trained at Wallops Station, conducted assembly, checkout,
     and launch services on cost-reimbursable basis. SAS-B would be

  Fifth anniversary of NASAâ€™s Pioneer VI interplanetary probe. Since
    launch Dec. 16,1965, Pioneer VIhad orbited Sun six times, covering
    5.3 billion km (3.3 billion mi); passed behind sunâ€™s far side (relative
    to earth) once, providing new data on solar atmosphere and pioneer-
    ing solar weather reports from far side; made important contribu-
    tions to defining exact orbits and mass of moon and planets; and
      erformed ex eriment to check theory of relativity. Pioneer VIdata
    Rad filled 11 7gU kin (7300 mi) of analog data tapes, recording 35 bil-
    lion data bits in 9500 hrs of communications sessions during almost
    45000 hrs of flight. Its maximum distance from earth on sunâ€™s far
    side had been 290 million km (180 million mi).
       First of four Pioneer probes now in orbit, Pioneer VI was firmly
    stabilized in plane of earthâ€™s orbit by its 60-rpm spin and would need
    no further orientation maneuvers. Last maneuver had been made in
    1966. One of two radio receivers was operating satisfactorily and
    solar cells, although damaged by massive solar flares, were still
    providing power. All other experiments except magnetometer were

   (Rpt. 91-1496). Report on history of DOD TFX program concluded:
    Sept. 1, 1961, decision by Secretary of Defense Robert S . Mc-
   Namara to start program was wrong; November 1962 decision to
   choose second best TFX proposal at higher price was wrong; failure
   to heed warnings in February, July, and October 1964 of technical
   difficulties and to allow redesign of F-ll1B was wrong; order to start
   Project Icarus in October 1966 and to place personal management of
    TFX in Office of Secretary of Defense was poor management deci-
    sion â€œmade in desperationâ€; and decision to continue F-ll1A pro-
    duction line April-May 1967 was wrong.
       TFX program had been â€œfailureâ€ on which Federal Government
    would spend more than $7.8 billion to procure 500 aircraft, although
    original production schedule called for more than 1700 aircraft for
    less money. â€œOf the 500 planes we will have, less than 100 (the F-
    11IFâ€™S) come reasonably close to meeting the original standards.
    Spending so great a sum for so few aircraft represents a fiscal blun-
    der of the greatest magnitude. It is clear that vital financial resources
    were squandered in the attempt to make the TFX program produce
    satisfactory results.â€ (Text)

December .27: NASAâ€™ .announced Stanford Univ. scientists were
   measuring solar wind in 61-million-km (38-million-mi) space be-
   tween sun-orbiting Pioneer VI (launched Dec. 16, 1965) and Pioneer
    VIII(launched Dec. 13, 1967). Purpose of experiment was to study
   influence of solar wind on earthâ€™s long-term weather cycles and ob-
   tain information on solar workings for particle physics. ARC-man-
   aged project would continue until May 1971; spacecraft would hold
   almost fixed position 100 million km (62 million mi) from earth until
   that time. Measurements were obtained by determining way radio
   signals between Stanfordâ€™s 46-m (150-ft) antenna and Pioneers were
   slowed by interplanetary electrons. Stanford scientist Dr. Thomas
   Croft had said measurements were â€œprobably the most accurate
   ever made of the density of free electrons in the solar wind.â€ (NASA

   Mrs. Marjorie R. Townsend, SAS-A Project Manager at GSFC, said
   launch went smoothly and only few minor anomalies had occurred
   so far: â€œWe are running at higher temperatures than we anticipated
    seeing at specific angles with respect to the sun. . . .Because of
   this it took us longer to despin than we had anticipated. The despin
   dumps a lot of excess [heat] into the spacecraft so we had to turn it
   on for a while and then turn it off. . .until we did get it into nominal
   operation. As of this morning SAS-A is working perfectly.â€ (Tran-

During December: Discovery of two galaxies possibly only 10 mil-
    lion yrs old-one thousandth the age determined for galaxies under
    â€œbig bangâ€ theory that all material in universe had exploded in one
    place 10 billion yrs ago-was reported in Astrophysical Journal by
    Hale Observatory astronomers Dr. Wallace L. W. Sargent and Dr.
    Leonard Searle. Galaxies, about 100 light years in diameter against
     100 000 for larger galaxies, contained only 1000 to 100 OOO stars of
    short-lived blue type. Milky Way galaxy contained 10 billion stars,
    including those capable of living billions of years. If newly discov-
    ered galaxies were young, they would provide first evidence that
    galaxies evolved from infancy to old age and that galaxies could be
    created after â€œbig bang.â€ Dr. Sargent and Dr. Searle tentatively
    concluded that galaxies were â€œdense intergalactic clouds of neutral
    hydrogen in which the formation of massive stars is proceeding vig-
     orously while the formation of low-mass stars is suppressed.â€ (As-

   expenditures were estimated at $27.8 billion for 1971, 3.7% increase
   from 1970, but actually no increase in constant dollars. Ratio of total
    R&D expenditure to GNP would drop from 3% in mid-60s to 2.7% in
    1971 as R&D gains failed to keep pace with growth of economy. Fed-
   eral R&D support rose 1% a year over past five years but in real terms
    support showed 3% annual decline. Over same period, non-Federal
   funding grew 10% annually in current dollars and 5% annually in
   real terms. Space and defense R&D efforts declined as emphasis
   shifted to other programs. DODâ€™S intramural R&D spending declined,

    who had been nominated NASA Administrator by President Nixon
    March 5, 1969, returned to General Electric Co. as a Vice President.
    Dr. George M. Low became Acting NASAAdministrator. In March
    Dr. Wernher von Braun, MSFC Director, was sworn in as Deputy
    Associate Administrator for Planning, and in May NASAPlanning
    Board was established under his direction for coordination of NASA
    planning.
       NASA adjusted time-phasing of future programs to avoid commit-
     ments to excessive funding, but progress was made toward new
    goals and objectives announced in March. Design, development,
    and testing for Skylab program went forward and fabrication of
    flight hardware was begun. System characteristics for space shuttle,
     key element in program for late 1970s, were established and study
    contracts were let for vehicle and engine. Program definition studies
    for space station neared completion. ERTS spacecraft design was
     completed and aircraft flights tested remotâ€™e-sensing devices for
    gathering earth resources data from space. Two flight spacecraft for
     Mariner Mars â€™71 missions were progressing toward final testing.
     Mission design for Grand Tour of outer planets later in decade was
     completed and conceptual design of key elements of spacecraft es-
     tablished. NASA continued aeronautical and space studies in con-
     junction with DOD, DOT, NOAA, and other agencies-including

       satellite to study wave propagation and electron flows in magneto-
       sphere. NASA accepted experiment from French National Labora-
       tory for Space Astronomy to study stellar uv emissions from Skylab
       and accepted instrument developed by French National Laboratory
       for Stellar and Planetary Physics for investigating solar chromo-
       sphere structure from oso-I,scheduled for 1973 launch. Assistance
       was accepted from U.K.â€™s Jodrell Bank Observatory in planning
       activities of radio science team for 1975 Project Viking Mars probe.

During 1970

         New sounding rocket agreements were signed with Australia, In-
     dia, Spain, and Sweden, and negotiations were held with France for
     cooperative upper-atmosphere sounding rocket launchings at Kour-
     ou in French Guiana.
         Lunar material returned by Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 was studied
     by 54 foreign principal investigators in 16 countries in addition to
     U.S. scientists. (A&A 70; Pres Rpt 71)
    Aerospace industry sales continued anticipated decline in 1969, to
0
     $24.9 billion from $26.1 billion-decrease of 4.6%. Commercial
     aeros ace sales, primarily jet transports, increased 13.7% in 1970
     from p4.342 million in 1969, to $4.910 million. Increase reflected de-
     livery of wide-bodied jet transports. Space sales continued decline,
     to $3.606 million from $4.272 million in 1969, because of completion
     of Apollo program hardware phase and decline in military space
     expenditures. Aerospace industry remained Nation's largest manu-
     facturing employer during 1970, with more than 1 million workers.
     Employment in aerospace industry declined from average of
      1 347 000 workers in December 1969 to 1 067 000 in December 1970.
     Production workers dropped from 696000 in December 1969 to
     515 000 in December 1970, a 26% decrease. (Aerospace, 12/70,3)
    Apollo 11 and 12 lunar samples were seen by 41 million persons in
0
      U.S. and abroad during year. Samples were shown at 128 events
     covering all 50 states, with total attendance of some 12 million. Out-
     side U.S., samples were shown to almost 30 million persons in 110
      countries, including almost 14 million visitors to Expo '70 in Japan.
      NASA facilities across U.S. were inspected by 3 million persons,
      with heaviest influx at MSC (over 1 million) and KSC (1.2 million).
      (NASA Release 71-8)
    Scheduled domestic airlines experienced no passenger deaths within
0
     continental limits of U.S. during year. For all scheduled flights, air-
      lines compiled record of 0.001 death per 100 million passenger-miles
     -lowest record in airline history. Aircraft hijacked to Cuba totaled
      13 in 1970,31 in 1969. (DOTRelease 0971)
    Total scheduled airline traffic gained only 1% in 1970. Average growth
      rate in 1960s had been 16.6%. Airline industry incurred largest loss-
      es in 1970-$179 million. Losses caused rate of return on invest-
      ment to fall to lowest level in history-I 5%.Domestic passenger
      traffic growth slowed almost to halt in 1970. Beginning in August,
      passenger traffic on domestic trunk carriers declined each month
      from level of same month in 1969.(Air Transport 1971,  AnnualRpt of
      US scheduled airline industry)
    Operations at 335 FAA-Staffed control towers in U.S. and possessions
      decreased 2% from level of 56 231 821 in 1969 to 55 280 498 in 1970.
      Operations had increased 2% in 1969 and 11% in 1968. Number of
      aircraft handled by FAA'S air route traffic control centers declined
       1% in 1970. In 1969 centers had recorded 11% increase following
       1968 increase of 17%. (FAA Release 71-85)

                      A CHRONICLE FOR 1970

   The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Leonard
C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of
Congress. Sources included the United Nations Public Registry; the
Satellite Situation Report issued by the Operations Control Center at
Goddard Space Flight Center; public information releases of the Depart-
ment of Defense, NASA, ESSA, and other agencies, as well as those of the
Communications Satellite Corporation. Russian data are from the U.N.
Public Registry, the Satellite Situation Report, translations from the
Tass News Agency, statements in the Soviet press, and international
news services reports. Data on satellites of other foreign nations are
from the U.N. Public Registry, the Satellite Situation Report,
governmental announcements, and international news services reports.
   This tabulation lists payloads that have (a) orbited; (b) as probes, as-
cended to at least the 4000-mile altitude that traditionally has distin-
guished probes from sounding rockets, etc.; or (c) conveyed one or
more human beings into space, whether orbit was attained or not. Fur-
thermore, only flights that have succeeded-or at least can be shown by
tracking data to have fulfilled our definition of satellite or probe or
manned flight-are listed. Date of launch is referenced to local time at
the launch site. An asterisk by the date marks dates that are one day ear-
lier in this tabulation than in listings which are referenced to Greenwich
Mean Time. A double asterisk by the date marks dates of Soviet launch-
es which are a day later in this compilation than in listings which are ref-
erenced to Greenwich Mean Time.
   World space activity increased slightly for the first time in four years.
There was an increase in the total successful launches-114 against 110
in 1969-and an increase in total payloads orbited-I30 against 124 in
 1969. The difference between launches and payloads is of coursl: ac-
counted for by the multiple-payload launches (DOD, the principal user of
this system in the past, made only 4 multiple launches in 1970, orbiting a
total of 8 payloads; NASA also made 4 multiple launches totaling 8 pay-
loads; the U.S.S.R., whose previous multiple-payload launch was in
 1965, made one multiple launch orbiting 8 payloads.
   Of the 1970 world total, the United States launched 28 boosters carry-
ing 36 payloads (contrasting with 40 and 54 in 1969). Of these totals, DOD
was responsible for 17 launches and 21 payloads. The 28 launches made
the lowest U.S. total since 1960, and the 36 payloads are the fewest
 since 1961. Eight of NASAâ€™s11 launches were non-NASA missions-In-
 telsat-lll F-6, Intelsat-111 F-7, Intelsat-111 F-8, Noaa I, Nato I, Skynet B ,
 Oscar V, and Top0 I. The Soviet Union again dominated world totals,

launching 88 payloads. with a record 81 launches. It had launched 70
boosters in 1969.
   The year was marked by the Soviet manned accomplishments of So-
yuz IX and the unmanned exploits of Luna XVI and Luna XVII. The
two-man crew of Soyuz IX set a new world endurance record for the
longest manned space flight-nearly 18 days in orbit. The unmanned
Luna XVI landed on the moon, mechanically retrieved bits of lunarkoil,
and returned its lunar payload to earth. Luna XVlI deposited the first
unmanned lunar rover, Lunokhod I, on the moon; it continued to func-
tion and return information nearly a year later. In addition, Venus VI1
transmitted the first information from that planetâ€™s surface and Zond
 VIIIcircled the moon and returned to earth.
   Apoflo 13 was the major event on the 1970 U.S. space calendar, but
this third manned lunar landing attempt resulted in a mission failure.
The lunar mission was aborted following a service, module rupture and
the three-man crew employed emergency procedures and returned to
earth as quickly as possible. The U.S. also successfully completed a
biological mission (Ofo), and initiated a new generation of improved
meteorological satellites (Itos I and Noaa 0.  The NASA satellite Explorer
XLII, launched by Italy near the end of the year, discovered several
new extra-galaxy sources of intense energy.
   Also during 1970, Japan became the fourth nation to orbit a satellite
(Ohsumi) and the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China became the fifth with its
launch of Chicom I. France launched a satellite of its own (Peofe)in ad-
dition to a French-German cooperative effort to orbit the DiallMika-
Wika satellites. And Italy launched a NASA satellite from its mobile sea-
borne facility off the coast of Kenya.
   As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of
these appendixes is never complete, because of the inescapable lag be-
hind each flight of the analysis and interpretation of the results.

                         Appendix B
   CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES, 1970

   This chronology of major NASA launches in 1970 is intended to prov-
ide an accurate and ready historical reference, compiling and verifying
information previously scattered in several sources. It includes launches
of all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by
NASA or under â€œNASA directionâ€ (e.g., in 1970 NASA provided vehicles
and launch facilities and launched ComSatCorpâ€™s three Intelsat I11 satel-
                                Nato I , and U.K.â€™s Skynet B , as well as
lites, E S S A ~ SNoaa I , NATOâ€™s
Australiaâ€™s Oscar V and USAâ€™sTop0 I as secondary payloads; also, un-
der a NASA and University of Rome agreement, an Italian team launched
a NASA satellite, Explorer XLII, from Italyâ€™s San Marco platform off the
coast of Kenya, on NASAâ€™s         Scout booster). NASA sounding rocket
launches are published annually in Goddard Projects Summary: SateJ-
lites and Sounding Rockets.
   An attempt has been made to classify performance of both the launch
vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of prima-
ry mission. Three categories have been used for evaluating vehicle per-
formance and misston results-successful ( S ) , partially successful (P),
and unsuccessful (U). A fourth category, unknown (Unk), has been
added for payloads when vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a
chance to exercise its main experiments. These divisions are necessarily
arbitrary; many of the results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they
ignore the fact that a great deal is learned from missions that may have
been classified as unsuccessful.
   Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. Open
sources were used, verified when in doubt with the project offices in
NASA Headquarters and with NASA Centers. For further information on
each item, see Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main
chronology as referenced in the index. The information was compiled in
May 1971 by Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division
of the Library of Congress.

                          Appendix C
   CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPACE FLIGHT, 1970

   This chronology contains basic information on all manned space
flights during 1970 and, taken with Appendix C to the 1965, 1966, 1968,
and 1969 editions of this publication, provides a summary record of
manned exploration of the space environment through 1970. The infor-
mation was compiled by Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technol-
ogy Division of the Library of Congress.
   The year 1970 marked a sharp downturn in manned space flight. Con-
trasting with 1969, in which four United States Apollo flights and five
U.S.S.R. Soyuz flights put a record 23 men in space, 1970 saw only one
Apollo flight and one Soyuz flight place a total of 5 men in space.
   The three-man Apollo 13 mission failed in its lunar landing attempt
when a service module explosion crippled the ship on its way to the
moon. The lunar mission was aborted and the crew immediately em-
ployed emergency procedures to effect a safe return to earth. Using the
lunar module as a â€œlifeboatâ€ and conserving all power and life support
systems, the spacecraft circled the moon and returned safely to earth.
But the third U.S. lunar landing mission was unsuccessful.
   Soyuz IX, the only Soviet manned flight of the year, was highly suc-
cessful. The two-man crew orbited the earth for nearly 18 days and set a
new world record for the longest manned space flight. The crew per-
formed biological, geological, and meteorological experiments. The
previous manned space flight record of nearly 14 days in space was held
by the U.S. Gemini VZZflight of December 1965.
   By the end of 1970, the United States had totaled 23 manned space
flights-2 suborbital, 16 in earth orbit, 3 in lunar orbit, and 2 lunar land-
ings-with a total of 26 different crewmen. Of the 26 American astro-
nauts, 10 had participated in 2 flights each, 4 had flown three times, and 1
had flown four times. The Soviet Union had conducted 16 manned
flights, all in earth orbit, with 22 cosmonauts. Four cosmonauts had flown
twice each. Cumulative totals for manned spacecraft hours in flight had
reached 2446 hours and 51 minutes for the United States and 1479 hours
7 minutes for the Soviet Union. Cumulative total man-hours in space
were 6262 hours 42 minutes for the United States and 2548 hours 45
minutes for the U.S.S.R.
   Data on U.S. flights are the latest available to date within NASA. AI-
though minor details are subject to modification as data are refined,
major aspects of all U.S. manned flights remain subject to direct observ-
ation by interested citizens of the world, with a significant portion of
recent missions seen live on worldwide television.
