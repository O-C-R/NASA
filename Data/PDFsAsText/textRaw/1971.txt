                              Foreword
     This volume is the eleventh in NASAâ€™s   series of annual chronologies of
 astronautics and aeronautics. The intent is to provide a preliminary his-
 torical reference which at least identifies, orders, and offers partial docu-
 mentation for key events of the year.
     One of the curious aspects of these chronology volumes is that the very
 process of documenting NASAâ€™s portion of them reveals not only continuities
 but also distinctive patterns in the unfolding events. Each year has seemed
 to emerge with characteristics of its own. The year 1971 was no exception.
 As NASAâ€™s   record unfolds in these pages, it can clearly be seen as a transi-
 tional or bridging year. On the one hand many on-going programs demon-
 strated their value in solid accomplishments: Apollo 14 and Apollo 15
 brought manned lunar scientific exploration to dramatic maturity ;Mariner 9
 went into orbit around Mars after its 400-million-kilometer journey and
 began its extensive photography of that fascinating nearby planet; O S 0 7
 discovered â€œpolar capsâ€ on the sun; in aeronautics jet aircraft equipped
 with the experimental supercritical wing made 27 successful research flights
 and the quiet jet engine program was successful in its initial tests.
    On the other hand, the shape of the next decade of the space program
 took much firmer shape. It became clear that after a decade in which the
 moon was the major focus of the U.S. space program, the next ten years
 would emphasize earth-orbital programs geared to intensive study of our
homeland in the cosmos, the planet Earth. In manned spaceflight, even as
the final preparations were underway for the final two Apollo lunar mis-
sions, all flight systems for Skylab were in final manufacturing stages or in
checkout; another yearâ€™s intensive study by NASA and industry had refined
and hardened the design of the space shuttle to the point that we could ask
Administration approval to proceed, confident that a reusable, cost-effective
space transportation system could be built.
    In unmanned space programs, the first Earth Resources Technology
Satellite was readied for its launch in 1972, while aircraft flights were test-
ing its remote sensing devices. In aeronautics, the joint Department of
Transportation-NASA study of national civil aviation R&D requirements led
to the contract for design of the experimental STOL transport aircraft.
Administratively, the quintupling of funds for space technology transfer to
the civilian economy and the establishment of the NASA Office of Applica-
tions were other indications of the increased priority for practical benefits
from space research. While all of the foregoing was accomplished within
the constraints of the lowest space budget since 1962, congressional ap-
proval of an F 1972 budget that was slightly larger ended the trend of
                 Y
progressively smaller space budgets that had begun in 1967. This was taken
in NASA as endorsement for the new stable realignment of the space program
toward the needs of man on earth for the decade ahead.
    I commend to you, in the pages that follow, 1971, the year of transition.

   A chronicle is not a history explaining â€œwhysâ€ and â€œwhereforesâ€ in
refined literary form. But a reference of immediate usefulness is provided
by a chronology attempting to be comprehensive, with documentation to
available sources. Astronautics and Aeronautics for 1971, the eleventh
annual volume so compiled, also helps give future historians a running
start on events in aerospace science and technology gleaned from the vast
contemporary literature. More detailed chronology will be derived from
historical research in the primary document sources as well as from oral
interviews concerning pivotal events not necessarily committed to paper
form. This volume is thus but a first step in the historical process.
   One of the intrinsic features of this annual chronology is the inclusion
of policy statements, some commentary on the impact of technology and
social concerns, and biographical notes which amplify the central story of
hardware, programs, and science activities. It covers worldwide aerospace
events. As with earlier volumes the reader is advised to make use of the
detailed index for subjects of particular interest. It has been somewhat
surprising that a few readers find it of value to read through the entire
volume. A concise chronology does not seek high literary marks other
than brevity, accuracy, and source citation to assist additional research.
   General editor of this volume was the Deputy NASA Historian, Frank W.
Anderson, Jr., and the technical editor was Mrs. Carrie E. Karegeannes.
The entire NASA Historical Office participated in source selection, review,
and publication. Archivist Lee D. Saegesser collects current documentation.
The Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress, under
an exchange of funds agreement, drafts monthly segments in comment
edition form, which are circulated for corrections and use. At the Library
Mrs. Patricia D. Davis, Mrs. Carmen B. Brock-Smith, and Mrs. Shirley M.
Singleton carry principal responsibility. At the end of the year, the entire
manuscript is reworked to include comments received and recent additional
information. Arthur G. Renstrom of the Library of Congress prepared the
extensive index, which is indispensable to the usefulness of a chronology.
The index serves also as a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms used
in the chronology.
   Appendix A, â€œSatellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights, 1971,â€
Appendix B, â€œChronology of Major NASA Launches, 1971,â€ and Appendix C,
â€œChronology of Manned Space Flight, 1971,â€ were prepared by Leonard
C. Bruno of the Library staff. Appendix D, â€œAbbreviations of References,â€
was prepared by Mrs. Brock-Smith.
   Without the validation throughout NASA and other Federal agencies, the
content of this volume would be less reliable and less nearly complete.

January I : Discovery of galaxies Maffei 1 and Maffei 2 about 3 million
    light years from earth was reported in Astrophysical Journal by team
    of Univ. of California at Berkeley, Cal Tech, and Carnegie Institution
    astronomers headed by Robert Landau of Univ. of California at
    Berkeley. Galaxies previously had been obscured by interstellar dust
    in Milky Way. Team had begun study after Landau read 1968 report
    of Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei that two strange objects had been
    observed on infrared photo Maffei made of region between constella-
    tions Perseus and Cassiopeia. Using Mount Palomar and Lick Observa-
    tory telescopes and advanced astronomical tools and research tech-
    niques, team had located galaxies twice as far from earth as Andromeda,
    nearest galaxy to Milky Way. Team believed brighter of new galaxies
    might be larger than either Milky Way or Andromeda and thus pos-
    sibly largest member of local group of galaxies, measuring 50000 to
    100 000 light years in diameter. (Astrophysical Journal, 1/1/71,

    1970, AAAS convention in Chicago: â€œIt should not be beyond the power
    of scientists to restore reason to its normal throne at their conventions.
    They had better set about doing so without further paltering or delay-
    by calling in the police if necessary to eject disrupters and impose
    order. It is a scientific fact, we beIieve, that only a single speaker can
    be heard at a particular time in a particular place. Those who want
    to hear him should be free to do so; those who do not should be free
    to go away. This is not alone the basis of science; it is also the
    essence of freedom.â€ (W Post, 1/1/71, A18)
January 2: GAO sent report to Congress that North American Rockwell
    Corp. stood to receive extra $1.5 million for beating target costs on
    NASA contract to develop F-1 rocket while, actually, target cost had
    been overstated originally by $5 million. NR had not used most cur-
    rent cost data available. GAO recommended that NASA seek adjustment
    in lees to NR and ensure that cost estimates in existing and future
    contracts were based on accurate, complete data. Report included NR
    statement of disagreement with findings and recommendations. (Beck-
    ler, W Post, 1/3/71, A8)
  USAF long-range planners were advocating DOD development of pilotIess
    combat aircraft, Business Week reported. DOD had consulted USAF,
    USN, and NASA about operational robots and had talked with RAND
    Corp., Aerospace Corp., and Mitre Corp. Ryan Aeronautical Div. of
    Teledyne, Inc., Boeing Co., Northrop Corp., and Cessna Aircraft Co.
    also had given DOD their views. Experts felt existing technology used
    in unmanned spy aircraft made pilotless combat aircraft possible. DOD
    had approved experimental hardware and flight tests. (Bus Wk,1/2/71)

January 4 : NASA was looking at air bases in the Carolinas, south Florida,
    and the Bahamas as possible landing site for space shuttle rocket
    launched from KSC, UPI said in Philadelphia Inquirer. NASA engineers
    also were considering refueling shuttle boosterâ€™s 1st stage in flight
    so that it could return to launch site for landing, like aircraft. ( P Znq,

* Discovery of cloud of hydrogen gas 80 billion km (50 billion mi) long
    and traveling through space at 210 000 km per hr (130 000 mph) in
    different direction and at 60â€ angle from solar system was reported
    in Washington Post. In interview Dr. Gary Thomas, head of Univ. of
    Colorado team of astronomers that discovered cloud, had said it would
    take cloud at least 50 yrs to pass by solar system and could take
    forever. â€œFor all we know . . . itâ€™s been there forever.â€ Cloud was
    discovered first by Ogo 5 in September 1969 and later confirmed by
    same satellite three times. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 1/4/71, A l l )
  New York Assemblyman Andrew J. Stein told Washington, D.C., press
    conference he had 76 cosponsors for bill which would ban supersonic
    transports from operating at New Yorkâ€˜s John F. Kennedy Interna-

January 5: Mayor Carl B. Stokes of Cleveland, Ohio, and LeRC Director
    Bruce T. Lundin announced that LeRC would assist Clevelandâ€™s Div.
    of Air Pollution Control by identifying and cataloging trace elements
    and compounds in air, determining their concentrations, and finding
    trends or patterns related to weather, season, and geographical area.

  Oklahoma Governor Dewey H. Bartlett told state legislature in Oklahoma
    City there was good possibility that Oklahoma could become launch
    site for NASA space shuttle. â€œBased on the launch azimuth and the
    orbital inclinations . . . Oklahoma provides both a desirable launch
    and recovery location.â€ (Daily Oklahoman, 1/6/71, 1)
January 6: NASA announced award of $$-million, cost-plus-fixed-fee con-
    tract modification to Ball Brothers Research Corp., Inc., for changes
    in OSO-H Orbiting Solar Observatory to increase experiment capacity.
    Change orders definitized by contract included larger physical volume
    to handle larger experiment packages, improved command system
    security, and increased power for instruments. OSO-H would be
    launched in mid-1971. (NASA Release 71-2)
* Lockheed Aircraft Corp. had rejected Dec. 30, 1970, DOD proposal that
    firm accept $200-million loss on disputed C-SA contract, Lockheed
    Board Chairman Daniel J. Haughton announced at New York press
    conference. Lockheed had chosen to take matter to court. Haughton
    estimated litigation would take two to five years. (Getler, W Post,

  NOAA said scientific team that studied 23 310 000-hectare (90 000-sq-mi)
    region east of Barbados in summer of 1969 had reached preliminary
    conclusion that dust blown off North African deserts into upper air
    ended in atmosphere over South Atlantic and influenced North Amer-
    ican weather. Scientists, who had hoped to find atmosphere relatively
    free of particulate matter, had discovered instead African dust in
    Barbados air at levels to 5000 m (16000 ft). (Oâ€™Toole, W Post,

JWUUTY 7: NASA launched series of three Nike-Cajun sounding rockets
    carrying GSFC experiments to obtain temperature, .pressure, density,
    and wind data in upper atmosphere by detonating grenades and
    recording their sound arrivals on ground. Rocket launched from Point
    Barrow, Alaska, reached 122-km (75.8-mi) altitude, with all 19
    grenades exploding as planned. Rocket launched from Wallops Station
    reached 130.9-km (81.3-mi) altitude, with 16 of 19 explosions con-
    firmed by ground. Third rocket was launched from Churchill Research
    Range. (NASA Rpt SRL)
  Release of â€œStatement of Government Policy on Satellite Telecommunica-
    tions for International Civil Aviation Operationsâ€™â€™ was announced by
    Clay T. Whitehead, Director of Telecommunications Policy for Execu-
    tive Office of the President. Statement said U.S. would promote pre-
    operational deployment of satellite communications in Pacific in 1973
    and in Atlantic in 1975. DOT and FAA would assume program manage-
    ment responsibility for preoperational and operational systems and
    services. Dept. of State, with DOT, would seek international use of
    preoperational system and initiate cooperative efforts with other nations
    to establish operational system by 1980. U.S. would use commercial
    communications facilities to maximum. U.S. Government would use
    UHF frequency band near 1600 mhz in both preoperational and opera-
    tional satellite air-traffic-control communications. Experimental evalua-
    tion of independent surveillance by satellite should begin with system
    deployment in Pacific and be followed by preoperational evaluation

  St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial commented on Dec. 23, 1970, DOD an-
     nouncement that Sprint ABM had successfully intercepted ICBM nose-
     cone over Pacific: Announcement â€œproved only two things : the military
     establishment recognizes that the wrir in Congress over full deployment
     of the ABM system is far from over; consequently the real target of
     the test firing was not a nose cone but Congressional critics whose
     arguments the Pentagon has yet to refute.â€ Paper wondered â€œwhy the
     secondary Sprints are needed in the allegedly foolproof Safeguard
     system if the Spartan is as successful as the military claims it to be.â€
     More puzzling was â€œhow the Pentagon can call the Sprint a success

     advance exactly when the nose cone target would be fired.â€ (St Louis

  Economist editorial discussed lunar science investigations : â€œThe growing
     importance of all this peering at, prodding, pounding, baking and
     growing plants upon moon soil is that the results are contradicting
     most of the moon theories of the past 15 years. It is not often that
     scientific concepts are set by the ears, and the piquancy this time lies
     in the way that the bulk of serious scientists originally believed that
     putting men on the moon was an unnecessary extravagance; instru-
     ments and unmanned probes could do the job, they felt, for a frac-
     tion of the cost and none of the risk. But, as it turns out, they could
     not. The instruments that were sent to the moon ahead of the astro-
     nauts did not produce the same results that the actual collection of
     rock samples has done, and it will be interesting to see if the Russians
     have done any better out of the robot shovelling of Luna 16.â€ (Econo-

     a long and excellent book about the flight, the story not only of what
     the adventure meant to the three astronauts who lived it but, no less
     interesting, what it meant to Mailer himself. The bureaucrats Mailer
    encountered first in hermetic Houston and then in hermetic Canaveral
     were unlike all other bureaucrats. They were infallibly courteous,

    across lunar surface and return to earth with samples or would ren-
    dezvous with other robot spacecraft that could return samples to earth.
    NASA spokesman said, â€œWe sincerely hope that collaboration with the

       Dr. Gerald R. Taylor, MSC scientist, described laboratory experiment
    in which three highly resistant strains of bacteria were killed within
    10 hrs of contact with one core sample from a number of centimeters
    below surface of moonâ€™s Sea of Tranquility. Micro-organisms in pro-
    tein soup had been exposed to lunar soil.
       Dr. Narenda Bhandari of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
    in Bombay, India, reported that analysis of cosmic ray tracks on
    moon had provided â€œconclusive proofâ€ of existence in lunar soil of
    fossils from chemical elements far heavier than any previopsly discov-
    ered in nature or in laboratory. If verified, discovery would greatly
    extend periodic table of elements. (Wilford, NYT, 1/14/71, 9 )
       Dr. P. Buford Price of Univ. of California at Berkeley, said during
    interview that ApoZZo 12 lunar samples might contain first real evi-
    dence of â€œmagnetic monopoles,â€ basic force units that were to mag-
    netism what electrons were to electricity. If their existence could be
    confirmed, it would mean rewriting books on magnetism and electro-
    dynamics. Dr. Priceâ€™s group of scientists appeared to have found two

    been made by monopoles in two lunar cysts. (Lannan, W Star, 1/14/71,

    craft and would attempt bolder missions in future. He believed U.S.S.R.
    would exchange lunar samples with U.S. beginning with samples of
    Sea of Fertility returned by Soviet Luna 16. He said main task for
    Lunokhod 1 , Soviet moonwalker still on moon, was to determine how
    eight-wheeled vehicle could best move about moon and how it could
    best be used in future. â€œWe discovered that the moonwalker can move
    in very large angles and can go down into craters at angles of 20
    degrees. The mechanical qualities oâ‚¬ this car are very good.â€ Dr.
    Vinogradov said Lunokhod 1 carried instrument to analyze soil, but
    device had not done so thus far. He described Luna 16 samples as
    bearing no evidence of water or life on moon. Drill used to dig sam-
    ples had been stopped at 330 mm (13 in) below lunar surface because
    it hit rock. â€œWe were afraid to send it any deeper.â€ Dr. Vinogradov

    described Sea of Fertility as â€œblackish powderâ€ sprinkled with â€œcos-
    mic beads.â€ Luna 16 sample was similar to soil brought back by
    Apollo 12 from Ocean of Storms and not very different from samples
    returned by Apollo 11 from Sea of Tranquility. Age of Sea of Fertility
    had been calculated at 4.6 billion yrs, older than some rocks returned
    by Apollo missions. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 1/15/71, A l )
       Dr. Paul W. Gast, chief of MSC Earth and Lunar Sciences Div.,
    reported discovery by MSC scientists of â€œexotic componentsâ€ in lunar
    soil believed to be fragments from primitive crust that covered moon
    4.5 billion yrs ago. Fragments differed from other Apollo lunar sam-
    ples and were thought to be pieces of crustal bedrock scattered by
    impact of meteorites pounding more ancient lunar highlands. Dis-
    covery, through chemical analysis, supported theory that moon once
    had hot, molten surface and that crust had hardened as it began cool-
    ing off. Discovery also helped explain why lunar soil was mostly one
    billion years older than lunar rocks.
       Dr. John A. Wood of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory de-
    scribed norite found in chemical analysis of five soil samples. Norite
    was lighter in color than most Apollo samples and did not appear to
    be chemically native to landing sites. Most norite represented â€œnear-
    surface material in an ancient lunar crust.â€ Coarser grained relative
    of norite might have come from â€œsomewhat deeper in the moon-
    perhaps several miles.â€ If discovery proved true, samples would go
    back in age to beginnings of solar system.

    Apollo 12 Sample 13, oldest rock yet found, at 4.5 billion yrs (other
                                                               Sample 13â€™s
    Apollo 12 rocks were about 3.4 billion yrs old)-said
    oldest parts were granite that crystallized early in lunar history and
    could be some of original crustal material and some of â€œmagic com-
    ponentâ€ that accounted for difference in ages of lunar rocks and soil.
    Dr. Wasserburg believed that fact there was always some missing in-
    gredients in lunar soil meant soil contained debris from granites and
    other materials originating elsewhere on moon.
       Dr. Gary V. Latham, Apollo program chief seismic investigator,
    reported Apollo 12 seismometer was recording weak but frequent moon-
    quakes along rilles near landing site. He suggested rilles might be
    â€œfault zones,â€ where slight movements in lunar surface were occurring.

    force was close to 600000 persons. Greatest number of successful
    launches from a single site to earth orbit and beyond between 1957
    and 1970 had been 311 from Vandenberg AFB, Calif. U.S.S.R.â€™s Bay-
    konur was second with 282, followed by KSC with 189 and Plesetsk,
    U.S.S.R., with 147. There seemed to be little difference between US. and
    U.S.S.R. space programs in general purpose and direction. Both were
    broadly based with elements of scientific exploration, technology de-
    velopment, national image building, practical applications, and mili-
    tary support services. Although military missions made up about t w o
    thirds of launches by both countries, number of presumptively spe-
    cialized U.S. military missions had declined from 34 missions in 1966

January 18: Widow of Astronaut Virgil I. Grissom, one of three astro-
    nauts killed in Jan. 27, 1967, Apollo spacecraft fire, filed $10-million
    suit in Brevard County Circuit Court against North American Rock-
    well Corp. and subsidiaries North American Aviation, Inc., Rockwell
    Standard Corp., and Rockwell Standard Co. Mrs. Betty Grissom charged
    negligence in fire which killed her husband and Astronauts Roger B.
    Chaffee and Edward H. White 11. Suit asserted spacecraft did not
    have proper fire extinguisher system, had no emergency egress, and
    was â€œdefectiveâ€ because electrical wiring permitted electrical arc to

  NASA announced it was requesting proposals from potential US. and
     foreign experimenters for investigations of data to be acquired from
     earth resources experiment package (EREP) to fly on manned Skylab
     spacecraft in late 1972. Data would be used to appraise value and
     direct applications of space observations in agriculture, geography,
     forestry, geology, hydrology, oceanography, and cartography. Objec-
     tives of EREP were to extend use of sensors; use man to observe, dis-
     criminate, and select study areas; and provide early source of unique
     research data for analysis. Three-man experimental space station
     would be manned by three different crews for total five months during

     million. More than 50% of total had been funded by other nations. In

    become fully acquainted with our plans and studiesâ€ to enable them
    to decide whether they wished to commit their own resources.
       European Space Conference had put several million dollars into
    studies of post-Apollo program possibilities and some member countries
    had invested still larger amounts. British, French, and West German
    firms were working with NASA prime contractors on space shuttle
    design studies. Europe would have to choose between significant
    participation in shuttle funding and funding independent European
    rocket program. Decision would be necessary â€œeven if Europe funds
    only 10 per cent of the shuttleâ€™s price tab.â€ US. had said it would
    â€œsell launch services for projects consistent with peaceful purposes and
                                          ..
    existing international agreements .          [and] that general technical
    access to the entire program would be available, but that technology at
    the level of commercial know-how would be transferred in either
    direction only where one side required it to complete its commitments
    to the other.â€ Since Europe was talking of only 10% share of shuttle
    program, â€œwe said that we would retain decision-making responsibility
    except where European costs were directly affected, in which case
    decisions would be joint.â€
       In US.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space, â€œit is particularly important
    that we give clear recognition to both . . . competition and cooperation.â€
    US. was competing with U.S.S.R. â€œbecause accomplishments in space
    represent a measure of the state of our technology; and in todayâ€™s
    world, the level o our technology is of first importance, strategically,
                      f
    economically, and politically.â€ U S . was cooperating with U.S.S.R.
    â€œbecause we both live in a vast universe that must be explored, where
    important new knowledge is to he gained, for the benefit of all men,
    everywhere.â€
       While US. retained demonstrated lead over U.S.S.R., â€œit will not
    be an enduring lead without major new initiatives on our part-
    initiatives like the space shuttle and the exploration of the outer
             ..  .â€

    specifically agreed, initially, to exchange three grams [ O . l l oz] of
    sample obtained from Luna 16, for three grams each from Apollo 1         1
    and 12. These relatively small amounts are sufficient for detailed
    scientific examination of a comparative nature.â€
       Additional meetings on compatible docking arrangements had not
     been held because â€œdocking discussions are well underway, and the
    planned exchange of information is taking place.â€
       On visit to Soviet cosmonaut training area at Star City, â€œwe
    were welcomed by Cosmonauts Beregovoy, Nikolayev, Leonov, Shatalov,

    the key challenges facing this nation, and other nations as well, is
    finding means by which technology can be advanced, shared, and
    applied to common problems without restricting our individual
    national ability to compete for markets with the products of this
    technology.â€ This could be done by application of comsats for global
    point-to-point communication. â€œHere we have seen the initial research
    blossom into a demonstrated capability and then into an international
    cooperative venture.â€ Intelsat story â€œindicates that we should have no
    illusion about the readiness of nations to give up competitive advantages
    without compensating return. At the same time it is fair to say that we
    have seen there a willingness to accept indirect as well as direct benefits
     ...    such things as enhanced international security resulting from
    international stability, an enriched quality of life, and better under-
    standing of man as a biological entity. This is a hopeful sign and it is

    total U.S. budget) was $27 million less than FY 1971 NOA of $3.298
    billion. NASA expenditures were budgeted to decline $216.5 million
    against decline of $486.4 million in FY 1971. Reduction to $3.152
    billion placed proposed NASA FY 1972 funding at lowest level since
     1962. Of budget request, $2.518 billion would go for R&D, $56.3

    by increase from $515.2 million in FY 1971 to $672.8 million in
    FY 1972 for manned space flight operations. Manned space flight
    operations would include $535.4 million for Skylab, $100.0 million
    for space shuttle, and $37.4 million for orbital systems and experi-
    ments. Advanced missions would receive $1.5 million, to bring total

    million in FY 1972. Increases would go to physics and astronomy
    program for solar observatory ($19 million in FY 1972), High
    Energy Astronomical Observatory ($13.4 million) , and space tele-
    scope study ($500 000). Funding for lunar and planetary exploration
    would increase $166.6 million, to $311.5 million, with $38.3 million
    going toward Mariner-Venus/Mercury 1973, $180.4 million toward
    Viking project, and $18.8 million toward supporting research and
    technology advanced studies. Funding for Pioneer program of plan-
    etary exploration would decrease from $35.5 million in FY 1971 to
    $17.6 million. Funding for bioscience program, including Biosatellites,
    was eliminated from NASA budget for FY 1972. Increase of $15.5
    million in space applications programs, to $182.5 million in FY 1972,
    included $48.5 million for Earth Resources Survey, $13 million for
    Synchronous Meteorological Satellite, and $60.3 million for ATS.
       Total for advanced research and technology programs decreased
    from $264.2 million in FY 1971 to $212.8 million. STOL technology
    program would receive $15 million, against $1.9 million in FY 1971.
    NERVA rocket funding would decrease from $32 million in FY 1971 to
    $9.9 million.
       Tracking and data acquisition funding would fall $26 million, to
    $264 million.
       DODâ€™s FY 1972 budget of $76 billion for outlays included $1.55-

  NASA released Jan. 28 briefing on FY 1972 budget request, in which
    Dr. George M. Low, NASA Acting Administrator, said: â€œFor the past
    several years we have reported.. . a further decrease in budget author-
    ity. This year we can report a clear halt in this trend: the budget
    authority for FY 1972 is at the same level as the funds appropriated
    for FY 1971. The exact figure for FY 1972 is $3.271 billion.
       NASA would compIete Apollo program with four previously planned
    missions but would delay Apollo 17 five months to ensure that mission
    carried experiments originally scheduled for canceled Apollo 18 and

     19. Skylab missions would be delayed about four months, to follow
    as soon as practical after last Apollo flight. Plans for unmanned
    planetary exploration included two Mars orbiters in 1971, Jupiter
    flybys in 1972 and 1973, launch in 1973 for Venus-Mercury ,flyby in
     1974, and two Viking launches in 1975 to land on Mars in 1976.
       Dr. Low said NASA had asked for $190 million for space shuttle
    in FY 1972. â€œWe have included in our budget $100 million. This
    reduction means essentially that we will move out with the engine
    development exactly as we had planned; that we are still in a position
    to make a decision after we have completed the studies on the air
    frame development, whether to continue with additional design or
    whether to proceed with the development of the air frames.â€
       Near-earth science programs included Orbiting Solar Observatories
    in 1971, 1973, 1974, and 1975 and last orbiting Astronomical Ob-
    servatory in 1972.
       Space applications program would progress as planned, including
    two ERTS, two Nimbus experimental weather satellites, two Synchro-
    nous Weather Satellites, and two advanced communications experi-
    ments with ATS-F and ATS-G.
       New FY 1972 projects would include start of work on High Energy
    Astronomy Observatory (HEAO) and program for exploration of outer
    planets. â€œTo do this we will develop a versatile new spacecraft, and
    we will plan Grand Tour missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in
    1976-1977; and to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, in 1979.â€ NASA
    also would study mission to orbit Jupiter as alternative to first Grand
    Tour.
       Major new initiative in aeronautics in FY 1972 would be develop-
    ment of experimental STOL aircraft.
       Downward trend in aerospace industry employment on NASA pro-
    grams would be halted during FY 1972. â€œAlthough aerospace jobs will
    continue to decline in FY 1971, we expect employment to start
    increasing by the middle of FY 1972, with the end-of-year level being
    about equal to that at the beginning of the year.â€
       NASA would reduce civil service work force by 1500 positions by
    end of FY 1972, bringing total decrease to 6800 since July 1967.
       Work on NERVA nuclear rocket engine would be limited to â€œessen-
    tially long-lead time items,â€ preserving ability â€œto move forward. . .
    when the need arises,â€ without large expenditures in FY 1972.
       Program included â€œno plans at this time for a manned Mars land-

* Evidence obtained from uv photometers aboard two NRL Aerobee 150
    sounding rockets-one launched from White Sands into night sky in

    mersed in magnetoglow, NRL scientists reported in Science. Glow, from
    large volume of glowing helium ions, at 304 A, was similar to geo-
    coronal hydrogen glow â€œin that it extends to very high altitudes,
     but it is unique in that it is largely confined to the closed field line
    portion of the magnetosphere.â€ Because of magnetic containment,
    radiation had been termed â€œmagnetoglow.â€ Observations. of magneto-
     glow from inside and outside magnetosphere cavity promised to pro-

    of Spain, and Apollo 11 Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, Jr.
       Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with
    188.9-km (117.4-mi) apogee and 183.1-km (113.8-mi) perigee. Mid-
    course correction (MCC-1) modified trajectory so spacecraft arrival
    time at moon would be same as if launch had been on time. CSM
    separated from LM/S-IVB/IU at 3 :02 GET. Onboard TV was initiated
    to cover CSM docking with LM, but difficulty in docking was encoun-
    tered. First five docking attempts by CM pilot Roosa were unsuc-
    cessful. Mission Control in Houston, watching on TV, studied problem
   that could prevent extraction of LM and make lunar landing impossible.
    Alternate missions also were under study. Astronauts noted catches
   seemed properly cocked but did not release. Sixth try however, was
    successful; docking was achieved at 4:57 GET, 1 hr 54 min later than
   planned.
      Separated S-IVB/IU impacted lunar surface at 83:18 GET (2:41 am
   EST Feb. 4) at 7O49â€™ south latitude and 26â€ west longitude 174 km
    (108 mi) southeast of planned impact point. Apollo 12 seismometer
   detected impact and showed vibrations for about 2 hrs.
      Unscheduled 2-hr 22-min TV transmission from spacecraft was
   initiated at 1O:OO GET to troubleshoot probe and drogue of docking
   mechanism. Crew removed probe and drogue but found no foreign
   material or abnormal damage. Capture latch assembly was actuated
   and system performed nominally. Crew and ground were unable
   to determine why CSM and LM had failed to dock properly, but they
   found no indication that systems would not work normally again.
   Officials decided mission would continue as planned [see Feb. I].
      Second midcourse correction, with 10.1-see SPS burn at 30:36 GET,
   increased velocity by 21.7 m per sec (71.1 fps). Following maneuver,
   crew completed about nine frames of dim-light photography on earthâ€˜s
   dark side and continued to check out systems. GET update was per-
   formed at 55:40 GET to add the 40 min 3 sec lost by launch delay.
   MCC-3, scheduled for 60:38 GET, was not necessary. Third TV trans-
   mission, for 42 min beginning at 60:40 GET, showed Shepard and
   Mitchell transferring into LM and checking out LM systems. MCC4, at
   77:38 GET with 0.6-sec SPS burn, changed velocity 1.1 m per sec
   (3.5 fps).
      February 4-6: Apollo 14 entered lunar orbit with 314.1-km (195.2-
   mi) apolune and 108.2-km (67.2-mi) perilune after LOI burn at 82:37
   GET, including 40-min update ( 1 :55 am EST Feb. 4). Roosa called to
                          .
   Mission Control: â€œ. . youâ€™re not going to believe this-it looks just
   like the map.â€ Shepard described the moon and near-moon space as
   â€œreally quite a sight. No atmosphere at all. Everything is clear up here.
   Really fantastic.â€ Mitchell said moon looked like â€œa plaster mold that
   somebody has dusted with grays and browns.â€ Region where daylight
   stopped and darkness began had â€œsome fairly high crater walls and
   high country, with those long shadows, it really looks rugged. It looks
   like you could walk along that surface into the darkness and fall into
   nothing.â€™â€™

   abort during powered descent, and Shepard controlled descent manu-
   ally.
       LM Antares landed on moonâ€™s Fra Mauro at 10854 GET (4:17 am
   EST Feb. 5) on 8â€™ slope 9-18 m (30-60 ft) short of planned landing
   point. â€œWe seem to be sitting in a bowl,â€ Mitchell said. â€œItâ€™s choppy,
   undulating. There is a large depression to our right to the north of
   us, which forms another bowl. And I can see several ridges and rolling
   hills of perhaps 35 to 40 feet (10 to 12 meters) in height.â€
       First EVA began 49 min later than planned because of intermittent
   PUS communications. Shepard started down ladder, deployed MESA
   containing camera which recorded descent, and stepped on lunar sur-
   face at 114:30 GET (9:53 am EST Feb. 5). Mitchell stepped down six
   minutes later. â€œNot bad for an old man,â€ Mission Control told Shepard
   as he touched surface. â€œYouâ€™re right,â€ Shepard replied â€œIâ€™m on the
   surface. Itâ€™s been a long way and Iâ€™m here. The surface on which the
                                               ...
   forward footpad landed is extremely soft.       itâ€™s in a small depression.
   The soil is so soft that it comes all the way to the top of the footpads,

    boulders on the rim. It looks as though we have a good traverse route
   up to the top of the Cone.â€
       Crew collected 19.5-kg (43-lb ) contingency sample; deployed TV,
   S-band antenna, American flag, and solar wind composition experi-
   ment; and photographed LM, lunar surface, and experiments. ALSEP
   was deployed about 152 m (500 ft) west of LM and laser-ranging
   retroreflector was deployed about 30 m (100 ft) west of ALSEP. Mitchell
   conducted active seismic experiment, firing 13 thumper shots into
   lunar surface. Signals were recorded by geophones and transmitted to
    earth. Eight of the 21 cartridges misfired, but the 13 fired sent vibra-
   tions 18-21 m (60-70 ft) into moon. Crew was granted 30-min exten-
   sion on EVA and reentered LM after 4 hrs 49 min.
       After resting inside LM and checking plans for second EVA period,
   astronauts left LM at 131:48 GET ( 3 : l l am EST Feb. 6)-2 hrs 27 min
   earlier than planned. Astronauts loaded MET with photographic equip-
   ment and lunar portable magnetometer (LPM) and proceeded toward
   Cone Crater. MET bounced slightly during traverse but appeared stable.
   Astronautsâ€™ main problem was lunar dust which stuck to their space
   suits up to their knees. â€œWeâ€™re filthy as pigs,â€ Mitchell said. â€œEvery-
   thingâ€™s going to be covered with dust before long.â€ LPM site measure-
   ment was made at first stop and LPM traverse measurement was later
   made near Cone Crater. Geological features were described and mate-
   rials collected. Crew was unable to reach rim of Cone Crater because
   slopes were steeper than expected and climb would have required
   running behind time line by about 30 min. Samples were collected in
   blocky field near rim. On return leg of traverse crew dug 0.5-m
    ( 1.5-ft ) trench and collected samples. Unsuccessful triple-core-tube
   attempt was made and other containerized samples were collected.
   Alignment adjustment was made to ALSEP central stationâ€™s antenna to
   improve signal strength being received at MSFN ground stations. Crew
   was unable to perform a number of secondary tasks because of time-
   line and minor problems.
       Just before reentering LM Shepard made surprise announcement:

February 4-6: Tracks of the modularized equipment transporter, used for the first
time on the Apollo 14 mission, were photographed (at top left) leading across the lunar
surface from the LM Antares. The inverted umbrella of the S-hand antenna was posi-
tioned by the astronauts to the left of the LM. Lunar dust clung to the legs of
Astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell (above) as he moved across the surface during extra-
vehicular activity. Meanwhile, in the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston, Texas, a
seismic reading of the Feb. 4 impact on the moon of the Saturn launch vehicleâ€™s S-IVB
stage was examined by Dr. Maurice Ewing (bottom left), Director of Columbia
Universityâ€™s Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, and Columbia graduate student
David Lammlein. The impact released energy comparable to 11 tons of TNT.

     six iron on the bottom of it.â€ Shepard dropped golf ball OR lunar
     surface and on third attempt drove ball about 366 m (400 yds).
     Astronauts reentered LM at 136:26 GET, after 4 hrs 35 min, bringing
     total EVA time to 9 hrs 24 min.
        While LM was on moon, Roosa, orbiting moon in CSM, completed
     bootstrap photography of Descartes landing site and astronomic pho-
     tography, including Gegenschein experiment, and prepared for short-
     ened rendezvous technique.
        Shepard and Mitchell depressurized LM, discarded excess equip-
     ment, repressurized LM, and lifted off lunar surface with 43 kg
     (94.8 Ibs) of samples at 142:25 GET-33 hrs 31 min after landing on
     moon. During braking phase for docking, telemetry indicated that
     abort guidance system had failed, but no caution and warning signals
     were on. Docking was accomplished successfully at 144:13 GET (3:36
     pm Feb. 6 ) with no probe-drogue problems. Probe was returned to

     earth for postflight analysis. Excellent T V during rendezvous and
     docking showed docking maneuver clearly. Crew transferred from LM
     to CSM with samples, equipment, and film. LM ascent stage was jetti-
     soned and intentionally crashed onto lunar surface at 148:22 GET
      (7:05 pm EST Feb. 6 ) at 3 O 35' south latitude and 19" 40' west longi-
     tude. Impact was recorded by Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 ALSEPS. Trans-
     earth injection maneuver, on schedule at 149:16 GET, injected CSM
     into transearth trajectory after 66 hrs 40 min (34 revolutions) in lunar
     orbit.
        February 7-9: MCC-5 at 166:14 GET increased velocity by 152 mm
     per sec (0.5 fps). MCC-6 and MCC-7 were not required. Inflight
     demonstrations of composite casting, liquid transfer, and heatflow
     connection were televised beginning at 172:30 GET. Press briefing at
     195:09 GET (6:32 pm EST Feb. 8) was of good quality.
        CM Kitty Hawk separated from SM at 216:12 GET. Parachute deploy-
     ment and other reentry events occurred as planned and Kitty Hawk
     splashed down in mid-Pacific about 7 km (4 nm) from recovery ship
     U.S.S. New Orleans at 216:42 GET (4.05 pm EST Feb. 9). Astronauts,
     wearing flight suits and masks, were carried by helicopter from CM
     to recovery ship, where they entered mobile quarantine facility with
     recovery physicians and technician. Crew, physicians, and technician
     would remain inside MQF until ship neared Samoa and would then
     be transferred to another MQF for flight to LRL quarantine in Houston.
     CM was retrieved and mated to MQF transfer tunnel on board recovery
     ship. From inside MQF-CM containment envelope, MQF engineer re-
     moved lunar samples and equipment through decontamination lock and
     CM was sealed until delivery to LRL. Sample return containers, film,
     and other data were flown via Pago Pago to Houston for LRL.
        Primary Apollo 14 objectives-to make selenological inspection, sur-
     vey, and sampling of materials in preselected region of Fra Mauro;
     deploy and activate ALSEP; develop man's capability to work in lunar
     environment; and photograph candidate exploration sites-were
     achieved. Launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performance was near
     nominal except for docking problems, spurious signals, and an occa-
     sional loss of communications. Flight crew performance was excellent.
     Crew exhibited exceptional poise during CSM/LM docking attempts
     and while troubleshooting AG computer. Accomplishments included first
     use of MET, largest payload-32 500 kg (71 650 1bs)-placed in lunar
     orbit, longest distance traversed on lunar surface, largest payload
     returned from lunar surface, longest lunar surface stay time, longest
     total EVA, first use of shortened rendezvous technique, first active seismic
     experiment, and first inflight technology demonstrations.
        Apollo 14 was 11th Apollo mission to date, 8th manned Apollo
     mission, and 3rd successful lunar landing mission. Apollo 11 (July

      think we cannot afford not to develop it. As the richest nation in the
      world we have a moral obligation to bring our new technology to bear
      to help the helpless. But let us talk about our national security. On
      both well-fed sides of the Iron Curtain, an uncomfortable amount of
      raw thermonuclear power has been piled up in the name of â€˜deterring
      the other side.â€™ In the meantime, the under-fed, over-populated part
      of the world, too poor to build thermonuclear bombs, has quietly
      developed a far more terrifying threat to the thermonuclear powers:
      the Population Bomb. Is is not just common sense to spend at least
      a small part of our tax money set aside for national security on the
      task of defusing that bomb? It is gratifying indeed to know that, by
      establishing a global Earth-resources survey and management system,
      we can combine a project bound to vastly enhance our national secu-
      rity with a noble contribution to the welfare of the world, a charity
      quite likely to save the lives of millions.â€ (A&A, 1/71, 2 6 5 )

February 1: Capt. Chester M. Lee (USN), Apollo Mission Director, dis-
    cussed Apollo 14â€™s docking problems with press at MSC and assured
                                                                  .
    press mission would continue toward moon as planned: â€œ. . first of
    all we did have a successful docking and every indication is that it
    was a normal docking.â€ Engineers â€œhave been making extensive analy-
    sis here and we can find nothing wrong with the probe. So far as weâ€™re
    concerned itâ€™s all operating. We do not fully understand why it did
    not operate or why the first attempts at docking were not successful.
                                                       .
    However, we are confident that the drogue . . is good. As to the

    cause, it could have been a foreign particle. . . we did ask the crew

    We did ask them to inspect the probe head very carefully .          to see
    if there were any foreign particles. We found none. If that were the
    problem, it apparently dislodged and is no longer there and is no
    longer causing a problem . . . and the probe certainly works now.â€

        New York Times said that â€œas the world waited tensely for the out-
    come of the struggle to solve the problem, there was a deep sense of
    disappointment at the possibility that all the effort, training and plan-

        Washington Evening Star editorial caIIed Apollo I4 â€œpressure mission.â€
     It had â€œalready qualified for several entries in the record book. It is
    the first Apollo mission to be crewed entirely by men who have never
    before flown in earth orbit and commanded by a veteran whose total
    previous time in space was 15 minutes. The mission is led by the oldest
    man to go into space, the first American to ride a rocket, the only
    astronaut to return to active duty after a medically enforced period of
    idleness. It is the first Apollo shot to be delayed because of weather.
     It is the first to run into a major problem on its first day out. It is a
    mission that, in the opinion of many in the top ranks of the space
     agency, will decide the future of manned space flight.â€ (W Star,

    National Observatory astronomer David L. Crawford. Gum Nebula,
    largest known object within Milky Way Galaxy, extended 60â€™ across
     southern sky. Light took some 3000 yrs to cross it at speed of 299 000
     km (186000 mi) per sec. Previous theory had been that nebula
     glowed visibly because it contained â€œhotâ€ stars that ionized surround-
     ing hydrogen gas cloud. New interpretation, based on more accurate
     information on nebulaâ€™s distance from earth, indicated Gum Nebula
     was produced with pulsar during supernova explosion some 1 000 yrs

    gress January 2971: â€œThe activities of our space program during the
    year are consistent with the recommendations I made in March for a
    balanced space program. Our goals are continued exploration, scientific
    knowledge and practical applications. The technology acquired through
    our space programs has many practical applications on earth ranging
    from communications, meteorology and navigation to agriculture, edu-
    cation and transportation.â€ Specific objectives were continued lunar
    exploration to increase scientific return on Apollo program investment,
    exploration of solar system and universe, reduction of space operation
     costs, expansion of knowledge of â€œmanâ€™s ability to perform produc-
    tively in the hostile environment of space and to relate this knowl-
    edge to uses here on earthâ€ and application of space technology to envi-
    ronmental problems. â€œWe should also promote international coopera-
     tion in our space program by pursuing joint space ventures, exchang-
     ing scientific and technical knowledge, and assisting in the practical
     application of this knowledge. We are greatly encouraged by Euro-
    pean interest in joining us in cooperative post-Apollo planning.â€

    ites were not source of lunar carbide, â€œthen we are left with the pos-
    sibilities that the carbides represent primordial indigenous lunar car-
    bon, however formed, or the product of interaction between solar wind
    carbon and metals or metal oxides or minerals on the lunar surface.â€
    Evidence existed for presence of carbides in Apollo 11 rocks but
    amounts were too low for isotopic measurements. â€œIf the carbon was
    indeed indigenous to the lunar rocks, the observed range of isotopic
    composition would be more representative of primordial lunar carbon.â€

 President Nixonâ€™s FY 1972 science budget was analyzed in Science:
    Budget proposed selective increases for R&D which would â€œstart the
    federal science budget upward again after several years of virtually
    static financing.â€ Impact in FY 1972 spending would not be dramatic
     â€œsince there is a lag of as much as 2 or 3 years between the obligation
    and actual spendingâ€ but budget served as â€œdeclaration of intentions.â€
    Nixon Administration showed â€œinclination to maintain high-quality
    capabilities for research but to restrain expansion of research and,
    particularly, of manpower training except in areas judged to contribute
    to the solution of major nation problems.â€ Priorities were indicated
    by choices of agencies and programs for major increases: NSF budget
    would exceed $600 million for first time, with major portion of in-
    creases going to additional support of research grants. New cancer
    research program would receive $100 million. Substantial increases
    would provide funds for research on environmental problems, highway
    safety, air traffic control, and crime reduction. DOD R&D spending would
    be increased with additional funds split between work on strategic and
    tactical weapons.
        Obligational authority for total Federal science budget would rise
    to $16.7 billion from $15.6 billion in FY 1971, but estimated expendi-
    tures would rise only from $15.3 to $15.6 billion. NSF would get new
    obligational authority of $622 million in FY 1972 but would spend esti-
    mated $546 million. (Science, 2/5/71,459-60)

February 8: ApoZZo 14 Astronauts Alan B. Shepard, Jr., Edgar D. Mitchell,
     and Stuart A. Roosa held 25-min press conference, televised from
    spacecraft during transearth coast. Mitchell called mission â€œquite a
    successâ€ in spite of failure to reach Cone crater during second EVA:
     â€œI think the majority of the type rocks we would find at the rim were
    in the boulder field that we were working, although it was a disap-
    pointment, just as a matter of challenge, not to get up there. I think
    we accomplished the scientific objectives that we went for.â€
       Shepard explained major problem was â€œthe undulating terrain where
    you simply couldnâ€™t see more than 100 to 150 yards [90 to 140 meters]
    away from you. Consequently, you were never quite sure what land-
    mark would appear when you topped the next ridge. We were very
    surprised when we . . . approached the ridge which we thought to be
    the rim of Cone Crater, to find there was another one behind it. And
    that was the beginning of the real problem. As far as we were con-
    cerned, our only problem was the amount of time allotted for the
    excursion. To us it was just a matter of working against the clock.
    I donâ€™t believe that we were disoriented or lost any time. I think if
    we had wanted to reach the top of the crater and did nothing else,
    that we could have done that within the time period allotted. But I
                                              ..
    think the method to which we reverted . of collecting rocks from
     a point not quite near the top of the crater provided a lot more geo-
                                                                          .
    logically and gave us a better cross-section of the rocks in the area . .
    than had we gone to the crater and back and not collected as many
    rocks.â€ (NYT, 2/9/71, 26)

  European interest in US. space program had â€œwith notable exceptionsâ€
    dwindled since Apollo 11â€™s first lunar landing and â€œtrouble-fraughtâ€
    Apollo 13, New York Times said. Despite extensive press and TV
    coverage, Europeans had taken Apollo 14 for granted. â€œIn some coun-
    tries local events overshadowed manâ€™s third visit to the moon,â€ but in
    West Germany opinion poll had shown that 64% favored continuation
    of manned space flights. Frankfurter R d s c h a u editorial had said,
    â€œWhat Shepard and Mitchell carried off couldnâ€™t have been done by
    a Lunokhod.â€
       Polish newspapers had given equal prominence to Lunokhod 1 and
    Apollo 14, but stressed technological feat of unmanned vehicle.
       Soviet press had highlighted Apollo 14 difficulties to suggest supe-
    riority of unmanned vehicles. Soviet man in street â€œseemed bored with
    space exploration, although some Russians went out of their way to
    ask Westerners about the United States moonshot.â€ Komsomolskaya
    Pravda, Soviet youth daily, had praised astronautsâ€™ â€œindisputable
    bravery.â€
       In U.K. Apollo 14 had been overshadowed by unrest in Northern
    Ireland and collapse of Rolls-Royce Ltd. Live TV coverage of Apollo 14
    had been less than of previous Apollo missions.
       Earthquake and civil disorders had crowded Apollo 14 from front
    page of Italian newspapers, and Feb. 7 power blackout in New York
    had received as much space as launch. Italian radio and TV coverage
    had been thorough but audiences seemed smaller than for previous
    Apollos. Pope Paul VI had praised Apollo 14 as advance for all man-
    kind.
       In France interest had waned as mission progressed. Newspapers
    and TV offered comprehensive coverage but â€œexcitement of two years
    agoâ€ had vanished.
       Spaniards, too, were losing interest in space exploration and public
    interest had declined in Hungary and Yugoslavia. Communist student
    leader in Zagreb had said, â€œIf the Americans and Russians would
    cooperate in space instead of carrying their rivalries to the moon,
    maybe there could be some scientific progress on earth and maybe the

  Analysis of low-frequency sound from Apollo 14 spacecraft passing 188

    rival times after spacecraft launch from ICSC and were only coherent
    signals recorded over many hours. Observations â€œseem to establish that

  Age and composition effects on alteration of lunar optical properties were
    described in Science. Evidence from Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 samples
    and telescopic spectral reflectivity measurements indicated that lunar
    seas â€œare similar in mineralogy on a regional scale and that the high-
    lands are consistent with an anorthositic-gabbro composition. Bright
    craters and rays in both regions expose materials that are relatively
     crystalline compared with their backgrounds, which are richer in dark
     glass. With age, bright craters and rays in the maria darken in place by
     meteorite impact-induced vitrification and mixing with the surrounding
     material. Highland bright craters and rays may, however, darken pri-
    marily through regional contamination by iron and titanium rich m r e
     material.â€ (Adams, McCord, Science, 2/12/71,567-71)

      Fra Mauro area indicates that better new equipment is needed to ex-
      tend the range and accuracy of their explorations. And once the various
      typical areas of the lunar surface are reached it is obvious that vehicles
      with payloads much larger than Apollo will be required to haul the
      equipment needed to establish permanent scientific working stations on
      the lunar surface. For not until that is accomplished will man really
      begin to reap the full harvest of knowledge from his lunar capabilities.â€

* Evidence of nature of clouds of Venus derived from comparing polariza-

     by James E. Hansen and Dr. Albert Arking of Goddard Institute for
     Space Studies. Linear polarization of sunlight multiply scattered by
     atmosphere and Venus cloud particles had been computed and com-
     pared with observations over wavelength range from uv to infrared
     region. Refractive index of cloud particles was 1 . 4 5 t 0.02 at 0.55,~
     wavelength. There was indication of slight decrease in value from uv
     to near-infrared region; mean particle radius was very near l p and
     most of particles were spherical. Cloud layer occurred high in atmos-
     phere where pressure was about 50 millibars or equivalent to approxi-
     mately 20-km (12.4-mi) altitude on earth. Results for index of refrac-
     tion eliminated possibility that visible clouds were composed of pure
     water or ice. Aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and carbon sub-
     oxide â€œare not absolutely excluded, but the liklihood for either is not

       NASA and AEC support of NERVA project was â€œclear example of sus-
    tained support over many years of an advanced development even
    though we have not yet come to the point of proposing the specific
    missions on which it would be used.â€ While best chemical propulsion
    systems operated at specific impulse of 450 sec, â€œwith nuclear pro-
    pulsion we have demonstrated . . . equivalent specific impulse of 825
    seconds and have every confidence that the technology we are develop-
    ing . . . can raise this to at least 900 seconds. Thus, our justification
    for the large and continuing investment in the NERVA program is that
    we have a way of breaking one of the principal limiting constraints
    on space flight by doubling our propulsion efficiencies for many impor-
    tant classes of large space missions.â€
       Dr. Low, in response to questions, testified that NASA plan to stretch
    out NERVA development program would necessitate immediate employ-
    ment cutback from 2500 persons to 800. US. had invested $1.4 billion
    in NERVA since 1955. (Transcript; W Post, 2/24/71; B Sun, 2/24/71,

     tested, each adding importantly to our knowledge. Two experimental
     engines, which couple the reactor with the other principal components
     necessary to form a complete nuclear rocket engine, have been oper-
     ated. The last of these engines, XE, was started up 28 times and tested
     over a wide variety of conditions. We have accumulated over 14 hours
     of system operating experience, including more than four hours at or
     near design power.â€™â€™ Specific impulse â€œof 825 seconds has been dem-
     onstrated for extended durations in a flight size reactor. A range of
     thrust levels, including 75,000 pounds [34,000 kg], has been demon-
     strated over a wide range of conditions, including the ability to
     throttle down to about one-half design thrust at full specific impulse.
     The ability to stop and start at will has been demonstrated. Finally,
     this system has proved to be quite predictable, an important feature
     from a development and operational standpoint. All of the technology
     goals of the program have been met and the potential for perform-
     ance growth shown.â€ (Transcript)

February 24: NASA development of short-haul jet transportation system was
     discussed by Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, at Coun-
     cil for Advancement of Science Writing Seminar on Science and
     Public Policy in Washington, D.C.: â€œWe estimate that the market for
    short-haul transportation will approach 40 billion passenger miles by
     1980, and may well be between 100 and 300 billion passenger miles
     by 1995. The problems of developing such a system are exceedingly
     complex. Involved are aircraft, airways, airports, avionics, ground
     transportation, and appropriate regulations. To be acceptable, the sys-
     tem must be low in noise, low in pollution, and low in its contribution
    to the congestion of local transportation. The service must be easily
     accessible, dependable, and comfortable. And the fare must be reason-
     able.â€ If development were to take normal course, â€œit would move
     ahead very slowly. And in the meantime, a domestic need would go
    wanting.â€ Foreign competition, with funding by foreign governments,
    â€œwould step in to fill the gap.â€
        â€œHere we have a good case where the government should help.
    The need exists; an integrated approach involving government and
    industry is required; and the initial development risk is high.â€ DOT
    was responsible for overall short-haul transportation system ; NASA had
    responsibility for developing experimental research aircraft. â€œBut NASA
    will not do this alone; we intend to approach this development in
    partnership-a joint enterprise-with industry. NASA and industry will
                                            .
    share the development responsibility . . and costs. The production

     petitive basis. But the government will have served the industry in
     speeding the commercial availability of the aircraft, and will have
     served the people by speeding the availability of a needed service.â€

* Crises facing airlines in early 1960s and 1970s were contrasted by Floyd
    D. Hall, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eastern Airlines,
     Inc., in speech before northeast region of Aviation/Space Writers
     Assn. in New York. Jet aircraft had offered â€œradically improved seat-
     mile factorâ€ in 1960s. There were no appreciable unit-cost savings in
     wide-bodied equipment of 1970â€™s. â€œIn sharp contrast with a decade
     ago, technology promises little help.â€ Economists were predicting no
     general economic boom of mid-1960 proportions for at least five years
     and there was â€œno traffic surge in sight so great as to mask or counter-
     balance our other problems.â€ There was â€œnew and ominous militancyâ€
     in labor outlook which had â€œsent costs soaring . . . at rate greater than
     normal even in our inflation-ridden economy.â€ In 1959, US. trunkline
     aviation industry had been committed to $1.7 billion in new aircraft.
     â€œTen years later, in 1969, we were committed to $4.7 billion-$6 bil-
    lion when the cost of spares and associated ground equipment is added
    - - o r more than three times as much. The value of flight equipment on
     order at the end of 1969 . . . equals nearly 87 percent of the net book
     value of existing flight equipment. The total commitment amounts to
    more than the debt and equity capital of all eleven trunklines combined
    as of year-end 1969.â€ In 1960s â€œwhen airlines sought new capital to
     finance their new jet fleets,â€ capital had been more readily available
     CI
       and airlines were able to compete for it against other industries on
     fairly favorable terms. Today we, a high-risk industry, are competing
     for it against low-risk industries, and at a time when the availability
    of capital is limited.â€ (Text)

* President Nixon transmitted to Congress second annual report on foreign
    policy, United States Foreign Policy for the 1970â€™s: Building for
    Peace: Space was â€œclearest example of the necessity for international
    scientific cooperation and the benefits that accrue from it. The world
    community has already determined and agreed that space is open to
    all and can be made the special province of none. Space is the new
                                                                      .
    frontier of man, both a physical and an intellectual frontier. . . As
    mutual help and cooperation were essential to life on the American
    frontier, so it is on the frontier of space. It is with that sense that
    we approach the sharing of both the burdens and the fruits of our
    space activity. . . . We have some 250 agreements with 74 countries
    covering space cooperation.â€ Space was â€œthe only area of which it can
                                                                    ..

        Presidentâ€™s report said it was â€œsettled U.S. policy to encourage
    international cooperation in basic science.â€ Closely allied was national
    policy on technology exchange. U S . preeminence in both fields posed
    question as to extent of its sharing scientific and technological knowl-
    edge. â€œThere are obvious security implications in many technological
    developments, for example in the nuclear and space fields.â€ U.S. policy,
    however, â€œis to keep those areas as circumscribed as possible, and to
    take the leadership in encouraging the exchange of scientific and tech-

    rational procedures.â€ France and West Germany had not forgiven
    U.K. for â€œwelshing on them over the-by US. standards archaic!-

    vehicle for commercial satellites, Europe could not compete on fair
    terms with U.S. â€œBeneath the European tussle of threat and counter-
    threat . . . run deeper waters: Franceâ€™s desire for her own telecorn-
    munications satellite system to propagandize former African colonies ;
    West Germanyâ€™s urge to become a fully fledged space power; the
    British Governmentâ€™s intense anxiety to enter the Common Market-
    even possibly, in part, by blackmailing its way in over the space
    program.â€ ESRO had built competency â€œwhich should not be allowed

    But then I shall never forget that at the conclusion          the one who
                                .. .  turned to him and said, â€˜Mr. President,
    was briefing the President
    members of the Cabinet, I simply want to say that probably the most
    important discovery we will make in our exploration of space is not on
    this chart.â€™ And that was a lesson for me. It was a great lesson for the
    American people. Exploration . . . involves going into the unknown.â€
       In space, â€œwe think we know what we want to find and what we may
    find, but the more we explore we break into new vistas of knowledge.
    . . . America must continue to be a great nation. We must explore the
    unknown, not because of what we are going to find or think we are
    going to find, not because of the uses that we expect to get from space,
    but because there is something there, something there that we must
                                .. .
    explore. Itâ€™s there to find.     this Nation with all of its capability and
    with all of its promise is first in space today and America, as a great
    nation, must set as its goal remaining first in space, because thatâ€™s the
    way to continue to be a great nation. This is a goal that we must set
    for ourselves.
       â€œNOW, to do this requires thousands of men and women on the
     ground, devoted and dedicated men in the scientific field, in the engi-
    neering field and other areas. It requires very brave men going on
    these journeys into outer space with all of the uncertainties that we
     saw on Apollo 13 and very brave women waiting at home with their
     children, their fathers, and their mothers.â€ (PD, 3/8/71, 407-11)

  Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, presented NASA FY 1972
     budget request to House Committee on Science and Astronautics: FY
     1972 projects-including Apollo 15 and 16, two Mariner spacecraft,
     first ERTS satellite, and continuing work toward future flights of
     Apollo 17, Skylab, earth resources and ATS satellites, and Viking probes
     -represented â€œthe fulfillment of enterprises of the 1960â€™s, the tailing
     off to completion of work in progress for many years. By 1974 the
     number of NASA space launches per year will have declined from 26 in
      1966 to eight. After the Skylab missions in 1973, we face at least 4
     years in which there will be no United States manned space flight.
        â€œFive years ago there were over 390000 people in industry em-
     ployed on NASA work. By the end of fiscal year 1971 that figure will
     be about 108000. The decline will continue â‚¬or a few more months,
     but we expect it to start increasing by the middle of fiscal year 1972,
     with the end-of-the-year total being about equal to that at the begin-
      ning.â€ U.S. was â€œrunning a serious risk of losing too much of the

    aerospace capability that is an essential ingredient of our long term
    national strength and security.â€
        There was every indication U S . would lose leadership in space
    â€œunless we move forward now with our space programs for the 1970â€™s.
                                                                          .
    In 1970 the Soviets launched 88 payloads into space compared to . .
    36 for the United States. Their R&D budget is continuing to increase.
    They have seldom missed a launch window in the exploration of Venus
    and Mars while we have many gaps in our planetary program. We
    would expect them to use automated vehicles and sample return space-
    craft from the planets, while we have no such program. Finally the
    Soviets have a systematic continuing manned space flight program and
    have stated that they expect to fly a space station before we do.â€ U.S.
    should continue to compete with U.S.S.R. â€œbecause accomplishments
    in space represent a measure oâ‚¬ the state of our technology; and in
    todayâ€™s world, the level of our technology is of first importance, stra-
    tegically, economically, and politically.â€ Dr. Low believed U.S. could
    cooperate with U.S.S.R. â€œin the areas we have under discussion with-
    out prejudicing any of our vital national interests.â€
        NASA was reexamining procurement policies and practices and â€œbe-
    ginning a serious critical appraisal of the proper size, composition, and
     organization of NASAâ€™s  institutional base.â€ Position reduction of 1500
     in FY 1972 budget was in anticipation that â€œreduction of this m a p i -
    tude would be found possible without unduly impairing our ability to
    carry out the program. Our budget justifications show this reduction
    as a flat percentage cut-about 5.10/,-in      all of our major activities.
                               .
     The actual adjustments . . will be refined as our study of the NASA
    institutional base proceeds.â€
        NASA program was 1.4% of US. budget, contrasting with 53% for
     domestic programs related to human and physical resources, yet U.S.
     stood to gain â€œtremendous benefits now and in the futureâ€ from explo-
     ration and applications of space science and technology. And whole
     future â€œas a nation and as mankindâ€ depended on space science. â€œFor
     in order to survive in the changing environment on our planet Earth,
     we must understand the processes that govern our universe.â€
        Dr. Wernher von Braun, Deputy Associate Administrator for Plan-
     ning, said purpose of NASA Meteorology Program was to â€œdevelop and
     demonstrate sensors and spacecraft for making those meteorological
     measurements that will enable a continued improvement in weather
     forecasting throughout the world with an ultimate view to a limited
     degree of weather modification and control of severe weather systems.
     Projections indicate that by about 1980 it should be possible to reach
     a global capability to acquire information throughout the atmosphere
     and to develop comprehensive weather models. Once developed, these
     models can be used to make 14day weather forecasts and long-range
      climate estimates.â€ Ability to develop weather models would permit
     basic experimenting in weather control.
         Space shuttle was key NASA development believed essential in 1970s,
      Dr. von Braun said, presenting U.S. with its greatest technology chal-
     lenge for space in this decade. â€œPreliminary analysis indicates that if
      the shuttle is used in lieu of current expendable systems, the trans-

     Findings that l i k e d light flashes experienced by astronauts in periods of
       otherwise total darkness to high-speed cosmic rays passing through
       eye retina were reported at NASA and American Nuclear Society Con-
       ference in Las Vegas, Nev. Findings were from studies by scientists of
       Univ. of Washington at Seattle and Univ. of California at Berkeley.
        Dr. Cornelius A. Tobias and Dr. Thomas F. Budinger of Univ. of
        California at Berkeley had twice exposed themselves to low doses of
        cyclotron-accelerated cosmic rays aimed at their eyes in effort to repro-
        duce flashes described by Apollo 11 Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr.,
        and Apollo 14 Astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell. Scientists said they saw
        flashes that differed from visual phenomena associated with x-rays or
        electrical and magnetic exposures. They concluded that flashes came
        from ionization and excitation of atoms in retina as it was bombarded
        by cosmic rays, Evidence indicated flashes were detected by retinal
        rods, structures in eyes that allowed night vision. Radiations were not
        believed to be hazardous to astronauts on short flights, but long-
        duration effects had not yet been evaluated. (Wilford, NYT, 3/4/71,

   The laser ranging team at the MacDonald Observatory in Texas has
   reported high-quality returns from the Apollo 14 reflector. As the
   worldâ€™s observatories refine their ability to use these instruments, we
   hope that they will be able to detect random wobbles of the earthâ€™s
    rotational axis. If so, this may contribute to the ability to predict
   major earthquakes.â€
       During past year, design and essentially all phases of development
   testing had been completed for Skylab and flight hardware was in
   fabrication. Definition of space shuttle was nearing completion. To
    develop limited capability to rescue Skylab astronauts from space,
    NASA had initiated design action on modification kit to give Skylab CM
    capacity to carry two men up to orbit and five men back to earth.
    Stranded astronauts could use Skylab cluster as shelter while modifi-
    cation kit was installed and Apollo-Saturn IB launch vehicle assigned
    to next revisit was made ready for launch. (Transcript)

    Fletcher as NASA Administrator: â€œMr. Fletcherâ€™s highest priority at
    NASA will undoubtedly be to try to restore morale, insofar as possible,
    in a program whose ranks have been decimated by the budget cuts of
    recent years. NASAâ€™s new chief apparently takes the job with few illu-
    sions. This is suggested by his recent comments that budgetary problems
    will probably force a shift from manned to unmanned space explo-
    ration, especially beyond the moon.â€ Such realism should â€œserve Mr.
     Fletcher well in the difficult days ahead as he tries to lead NASA to-
     ward a new equilibrium with a Congress largely disillusioned about
    the worth of showy and ultra-expensive ventures in space.â€ ( N Y T ,

          Most significant new astronomy program element was HEAO, â€œde-
      signed to unlock some of the most profound and puzzling secrets of
      modern physics.â€ There was evidence that in pulsars and quasars â€œa
      whole new regime of power generation exists and operates at levels
      that cannot be explained by modern nuclear physics.â€ Understanding
      these energy processes might lead to harnessing of powers â€œheretofore

      causes and effects in global air-ocean-earth interactions.
          Trend in US. space science and applications had been decreasing
      budget and launch rates; OSSA had had to â€œcut back ongoing projects,
      dispense with backup payloads, stretch launch schedules and mission
       intervals, and defer promising new projects,â€ but had â€œpreserved a
      steady momentum and a balanced program thrust wherever possible.â€
      High level of productivity in science, exploration, and applications had
       been possible â€œbecause of the background in technology, in engineer-
       ing, in conceptual thinking that was built up earlier.â€ But many
      valuable and important missions had been deferred into future, â€œa
       future we expect will permit us to revolutionize the way space is
       explored and used.â€ Key feature of this revolution would be reusable

       group of NAS-NRC Space Science Board recommended priorities for
       NASA OSSA programs at three funding levels for space missions in
       1970s. Study was made at NASAâ€™srequest. Highest priorities were
       recommended for probes of Venus and Jupiter beginning in 1975;
       completion of three remaining Apollo manned lunar missions and
       unmanned landers and rovers for lunar and planetary studies; series
       of HEAO satellites for x-ray, gamma-ray, and cosmic-ray exploration;
       Small Astronomy Satellites (SAS) ; increased astronomy rockets, bal-
       loons, and aircraft; development of mirror for Large Space Telescope
        (UT) ; continued study of earth-orbiting gyroscope and ESRO sun-
       orbiting satellite for studies of gravitational physics in mid-1970â€™s;
       pair of satellites to study interaction between earthâ€™s magnetosphere
        and solar wind and doubling of funds for solar-terrestrial physics;
        three satellite programs and increased data analysis for meteorology
        and earth resources surveys ; and ground-based research to support

  NASA Associate Administrator for Tracking and Data Acquisition Gerald
     M. Truszynski testified on FY 1972 budget request during House

     1970 OTDA supported some 50 ongoing scientific, applications, planetary,
     and lunar experiment missions as well as some 14 new flight projects
     launched in year by NASA and DOD. During Apollo 13 mission, with safe
     return after inflight explosion, MSFN â€œdemonstrated that it is, in fact,
     the astronautsâ€™ life-line to earth.â€ Valuable clues to origin of explosion
     were found in analysis of recorded telemetry data. MSFN was still
     supporting experiments left on moon by Apolb 12 and 14 missions.
     After FY 1972â€™s Apollo 15 and 16 missions, network would be continu-
     ously monitoring 16 ALSEP experiments. Satellite network provided
     tracking and data acquisition for average monthly workload of some
     40 earth-orbital satellites, including NASAâ€™s  scientific and applications
     satellites and projects of other Government agencies and foreign coun-
     tries. DSN supported Mariner 6 and 7 probes in extended mission
     phase and Apollo 13, as well as four ongoing Pioneer missions
      (6 through 9). Data acquired by Goldstone antenna on effect of solar
     gravitation on Mariner spacecraft signals had verified Einstein theory
     of delay of 200 microseconds in return of signals from gravitational
     field of sun. Construction continued on second 64-m (210-ft) antenna

   of the composite materials. The potential of boron and carbon fibers
   imbedded in an epoxy resin matrix to provide high strength, low
   weight structures has been discussed with you for several years. This
   year the testing of special glass fibers has revealed the possibility that
   low cost, stiff composites may be fabricated with much greater strengths
   than previously thought possible. Composites are finding application
   both as a replacement for metallic components and by augmenting
   metal strengths using selective reinforcement. In the forthcoming year
   we propose to construct several airplane components of primary struc-
   ture for installation and flight demonstration. We believe that these
   new materials will find widespread use in the industry when the
   technical risk has been demonstrated to be acceptable.â€

     hardships encountered by communities which are dependent upon
     defense industry and employment, to encourage cooperation between
     the United States and defense contractors in meeting the challenge of
    economic conversion and diversification brought on by changing de-
     fense needs, . . . and to facilitate the transfer of public and private
     resources to new national priorities.â€ Bill would require that portion of
     profits from military, space, and atomic energy contracts be deposited
    in reserve to be administered by National Commission on Peacetime

  New photographic process that produced nickel image by exposing ammo-

    ation had been developed by LeRC scientists Dr. Warren H. Philipp,
    Dr. Charles E. May, and Stanley J. Marsik, Lewis News reported.
    Advantages were that nickel compound was cheaper and more abun-
    dant than silver used in standard photographic process and, because
    nickel compound was not sensitive to visible light, process eliminated
    need â€™for darkroom or cassette containers for undeveloped film. (Lewis

    by NRL team headed by Dr. Herbert Friedman in Astrophysical Jour-
    nal. Spinar, 200 million light years from earth, could be entire galaxy
    of collapsed and rotating neutron stars or single, massive pulsar.
    Object had been found by x-ray detector aboard Aerobee sounding
   rocket.

   said new source, classified as a Seyfert Galaxy, emitted â€œsoft x-rays.â€

     Spinar would radiate 1000 times less visible light than quasar and
     12 000 times more infrared than visible light energy-approximately
     what had been found in Seyfert Galaxy. But x-ray emissions perhaps
     as much as 10 trillion suns indicated it might be powered by same
     mechanism as pulsar. Dr. Friedman speculated that pulsar such as
     spinar could be missing link between conventional galaxy like Milky
     Way and quasars and that spacecraft-mounted x-ray detectors would
     find â€œtens of thousandsâ€ of such sources. (Astrophysical J o u r d ,

    hearings on NASA FY 1972 authorization: FY 1972 request was $21
     million less than in FY 1971, primarily because of continuing reduc-
     tion in permanent positions. Request of $697.4 million was based on
     further reduction of Government personnel of 1500 positions, lowering
     employment to 28 350-total      reduction of 6971 positions from 1967
    peak and lowest level since 1963. Cut of â€œsome 20 percent in the
     1967-72 period is by a considerable margin the greatest, proportion-
     ately, to be made by any Government agency in the period.â€ Of total
     NASA force, scientists and engineers made up 44~8%~ technicians 26.7%,
     administrative personnel 13.9%, and clerical 14.6%. Hiring restric-
     tions had reduced number of new college graduates added to work
     force and raised average age to 41.3, with rate of 8/10 a year each
     year, endangering health and vigor of NASA.
        â€œIn the past decade, the aerospace industry, overall as well as that
    portion serving NASA, has passed through a substantial perturbation.
     Contractor employment climbed to a high peak, then dropped drasti-
     cally. The current estimate for industry employment on NASA work at
     the end of this year and next is about 108,000-less than one-third
     of what it was at the peak of the space program. But with the major
     reductions in the space program over the last several years, this is
    how it must be.â€
        Daniel J. Harnett, Assistant Administrator for Industry Affairs and
     Technology Utilization, testified on NASA management of its new tech-
     nology as â€œa repository of national resourcesâ€: Some 20000 technical
     contributions had been disclosed by NASA contractors, 3500 in past
     year. Another 4000 had been reported by NASA employees from
     inhouse projects. Contributions reported were evaluated, defined, and
    published for use by others. Allocations for FY 1972 were increased
    over previous year as NASA began to work with innovative events of
     early stages of 1970s R&D programs. (Transcript)

  Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, testified before Senate
    Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during hearing on
    US.-U.S.S.R. space cooperation: Recent agreements had been di-
    rected toward â€œachieving common objectives,â€ not â€œexchange of tech-
    nology.â€ Review of relations between NASA and U.S.S.R. â€œsuggests
    that we should exercise considerable caution in assessing the prospects
    for prompt and effective implementation of these agreements.â€ But
    US. negotiators of October and January agreements had observed
    â€œdefinite improvementâ€ over past decade. Negotiations had been
                                             ...
    â€œmore straight forward, less political.         A closer kind of relation-
    ship seems to be intended by the.Soviet side. The top level of the
    Soviet Academy for the first time participated directly. The negotia-
    tions were attended by the first instances of meaningful access to Soviet
    facilities.â€
        Dr. Low said he had â€œspent a half-hour or more inside the Soviet
    simulator with a young Russian engineer who explained in detail the
     working of that spacecraft and answered every question that I had.
     Later on, I was in the docking and rendezvous trainer with one of
    their cosmonauts and was allowed to attempt to fly a docking of one
     Soyuz against another. I did not succeed in bringing the two together.
     In addition, in January our delegation was invited to the principal
     Soviet tracking station in the Crimea. Unfortunately, the time avail-
             .
     able . . did not permit us to make this visit, but we have every inten-
     tion of doing so in the future.â€
        Advocating â€œair of cautious optimism,â€ Dr. Low said U.S.S.R. had,
     â€œin effect, met the schedules laid down in the first agreement with a
     variance of only a few days. In any event, we have laid out and agreed
     to specific milestones for an even-handed exchange, so that neither side
     will gain more than the other.â€

     and Soviet space programs had not been discussed at NASA-soviet

    of studies of unemployment of scientists and engineers, estimated
    30 000 to 40 000 were out of work at end of 1970. â€œThe majority of
    these came from aerospace-related industries. Projections indicate that
    this number could more than double by June 1972, which means that
    as many as 30 percent of the Nationâ€™s aerospace scientists and engi-
    neers will be unemployed. The effect of this national trend-in         terms
    of an individual scientist or engineer being reemployed-is magnified
    by the concentration of this unemployment, geographically and by
                                ..
    training and experience. . This not only causes great personal hard-
    ship but . . . represents the loss of a tremendous national resource.â€
    NASA-sponsored survey by Battelle Memorial Institute of persons laid
    off by group of NASA contractors from June 1968 to September 1970
    had made preliminary findings: only 31% had found permanent jobs,
    32% had found temporary jobs, 32% were still unemployed, and
    5% had left work-force. Average person was unemployed 31 weeks.
    Of those who had found permanent jobs, only 18% returned to aero-
    space. Of those permanently employed outside of aerospace, only 12%
    reported having positions highly related to aerospace skills and 50%
    reported new positions unrelated to aerospace. Unemployment rate of
    those over 50 was 48%. Of those who had found permanent work
    outside, 31% said they would not return to aerospace if given oppor-
    tunity; 16% said they would. Preliminary results of survey indicated
    cc
      we are losing much of the aerospace capability that is an indis-
    pensable ingredient of our long term economic strength and national
    security.â€
       In closing, Dr. Low made point that there was â€œno either/or choice
    between technological advances and social advances. Without tech-
    nology, we cannot maintain the capability to deal effectively with any
    national problem.â€
       Dr. Low was questioned on his testimony that U.S.S.R. was spend-
    ing more on R&D than U.S. was spending in total science and tech-
    nology area. He answered that Soviet space program, with apparent
    Soviet policy of steadily increasing R&D investment, would soon match
    and then surpass US. program in size and accomplishment. â€œFor this
    comparison, I am dealing with the combined civil and military space
    programs of both nations; to try to differentiate between civil and
    military activities of the U.S.S.R. would be speculative at best. The
    most difficult comparison to try to make between the US. and
    U.S.S.R. economies or programs is in terms of absolute costs: each
    national economy is geared and motivated to produce a different, non-
    parallel mix of goods and services.â€ (CR, 7/31/71, E8611-2)
       Dale D. Myers, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
    Flight, discussed future of Apollo program: â€œWe can now move with
    confidence to the final phase. . . . In these last missions, we will expand
    the capability of the system very dramatically. Design changes in the
    spacecraft and supporting equipment will allow the two astronauts in
    the lunar module to remain on the moon up to 67 hours, as compared
    with 34 hours on Apollo 14. The scientific payload landed on the moon
    will be doubled to above 1200 lbs [54& kg]. Changes in the command
    and service modules will permit up to 10 days total flight time and
    major increases in orbital scientific activities. During the Apollo 15

   heating, launch aerodynamics, etc. ; design of long-leadtime hardware,

      Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, testified on
   DOD applications of space transportation system and DOD-NASA        team-
   work on space shuttle : â€œPresent DOD satellite communications program
   consists of two major systems: The long distance point to point or
                                                                        . ..
   strategic system and the local-area multiple-user or tactical system.
   We are pursuing a new system called Defense Satellite Communications
   System, Phase 11, which can provide many voice channels to selected
   limited areas of the earth. These present and proposed systems give
   us the flexibility for voice and teletype communications from our forces
   overseas and allow rapid transmission of photographic images from
   operational theaters to the United States.â€
      In conjunction with NASA studies, USAF was analyzing defense applica-
   tions of space shuttle to provide better insight into utility of concept
   for DOD. USAF was providing NASA with data to help ensure that con-
   figuration was of maximum utility to DOD.
      NASA and USAF had worked jointly on engine development. Air Force
   â€œhas supported advanced development efforts on liquid rocket engines
   in the past, and more recently concluded a hydrogen/oxygen high
   performance engine demonstration program.â€ Engine, XLR-129, had
   â€œprovided the basis for selection of the reusable high pressure rocket
   engine concept for the shuttle. It also provided design data for a
   250 000-pound [1100-kilonewton] thrust engine which supports the cur-
   rent shuttle engine design concepts.â€™â€™
      In operational testing area, â€œUSAF and NASA recently conducted
   unpowered approach and landing demonstrations with F-111s and
             .

        Canadian-built Isis 2 was eight-sided spheroid that weighed 264 kg
     (582 lbs) ,was 127 cm (50 in) in diameter with two sounder antennas,
    and carried 12 ionospheric investigation experiments. Satellite was
    fourth in series of five satellites to improve understanding of iono-
    spheric physics. First launch in series (Nov. 28, 1965) had orbited
    Canadaâ€™s Alouette 2 and US. Explorer 31. Isis 1 had been launched
    Jan. 30, 1969. ISIS program was joint undertaking of NASA and

    probably be& produced by sunlight on Marsâ€™ surface, JPL scientists
    Dr. Norman H. Horowitz, Dr. Jerry S. Hubbard, and Dr. James P.
    Hardy reported in Proceedings of National Academy of Science of

    to biological molecules on primitive earth. Dr. Horowitz said findings,
    obtained from irradiation of fine soil and powdered glass samples by
    high-pressure xenon lamp and low-pressure mercury lamp, provided
    â€œmost favorable indication for a possible Martian biological evolution

    as a research vehicle, because there is no other airplane flying or in
    development with its particular combination of performance character-
    istics. It is equally important as an impetus to technology, since the SST
    contains thousands of components that have never been built before.â€

     that Dr. Oâ€™Leary had not worried about â€œlarge but inevitable dangers
     inherent in spaceflight itself, but bitterly resented the additional danger
     of flying jets (about a 10 per cent probability of death in a jet accident
     over a 10-year service in the program).â€ While jet flights had been
    emphasized, opportunities for scientist-astronauts to participate in

     of space technology. However, none of these require precise reentry
     after a brief, high velocity flight. Furthermore, nothing would be lost

April 1: Discovery that comets were made of water-ice and discovery of
    new concept of dynamics of interstellar hydrogen gas from data ob-
    tained by Ogo 5 (launched March 4, 1968) and Oao 2 (launched
     Dec. 7, 1968) were announced. Dr. Charles Lillie and Dr. Gary
    Thomas of Univ. of Colorado and Prof. Jacques E. Blamont of Univ.
     of Paris said at NASA Hq. press conference that OAO observations in-
     dicated comets were water with traces of methane, ammonia, and
    cyanogen. OGO observations showed gas surrounding comets to be
     composed almost totally of hydrogen and that interstellar wind pre-
     viously believed to be coming from constellation Hercules actually
     seemed to be coming from Sagittarius and Scorpius. Scientists now
     surmised that there was no stellar wind, but only apparent wind
    caused by passage of solar system through thin and nearly stationary
     interstellar medium of hydrogen. (Lannan, W Star, 4/2/71, A9)

     NASA proposed space shuttle development as top space priority for
     1970s, during Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences
     NASA FY 1972 authorization hearings: US. â€œshould and will continue
     an active space program from now onâ€ and new approach was needed
     to make space â€œpractical and economicalâ€ for all Users-NASA,        DOD,
     other Government agencies, and commercial enterprises. Reusable
     shuttle, â€œentirely new concept in space operation,â€ would deliver and
     retrieve manned and unmanned payloads; â€œwe will be able to repair,
     modify, or update payloads in orbit and . . . reduce drastically the
     costs of payloads by taking advantage of the much larger weight and

     the shuttle are compared with those using conventional launch vehi-
     cles, the shuttle offers a very real economic advantage.â€
         Shuttle development should proceed in FY 1972 because necessary
     technology was available, delay in development would widen existing
     four-year gap in US. manned space flight schedule, and shuttle was
      â€œkeystone to the total plan for the US. space program.â€
         KASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D.

    we speak of â€˜spaceâ€™ science and â€˜spaceâ€™ applications, we are talking
    about using a new technology . . . to enhance scientific progress and
    its translation into benefits. In this role, NASA is a service agency; we
    provide the technology, the engineering, the management, and the
    leadership that make possible the exploration of space and the prac-
    tical use of space flight. The scientific community, which represents the
    focus of manâ€™s unceasing drive for understanding, identifies the prob-
    lems and the unknowns, and designs the experiments that will answer
    the key questions. Society levies demands upon us for useful services,

        Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: DOD space
        funding program for FY 1972 called for $1552.6 million, slightly
        under the $1553.1 million of FY 1971. â€œThe design and fabrication of
        a new set of satellites intended to replace the interim Defense Satellite
        Communications System (DSCS) will be completed in 1971. These satel-
        lites, to be launched next month, have significantly higher power and
        greater bandwidth than their predecessors, and each is equipped with
        a versatile set of antennas capable of serving fixed and transportable
        users dispersed over large areas of the earth. Among these are steer-
        able antennas which can be oriented to satisfy contingency needs in
        changing global situations. To exploit the potential of this new sys-
        tem, we will need better surface terminal equipment. Accordingly, we
         intend to continue the intensive development of new reliable terminals
         and modulation and antijamming equipment.â€
             In FY 1972, DOD expected â€œto start developing a satellite communi-
         cations system that operates in the military ultra-high-frequency
          ( U H F ) band and is tailored to the characteristics of the mobile users.
         When deployed, this system should allow us to retire much of our HF
         radio equipment.â€
             Use of navigational satellites â€œhas the potential of attaining a continu-
         ous, highly accurate worldwide position-fixing system. That system
         could support many ground, sea, airborne and space applications.â€

    For unmanned military satellites, radiation hardening-mandatory for
    certain military missions-and low recurring costs for multiple mis-
    sions are important advantages of small reactor systems. For un-

    Kremlinâ€™s Palace of Congresses and with Soviet newspapers filled with
    articles commemorating flight.
       At Moscow ceremony Mstislav V. Keldysh, President of Soviet Acad-
    emy of Sciences, said U.S.S.R. was looking forward to time â€œwhen man
    will make interplanetary flights. Tremendous potentialities in the study
    of the earthâ€™s natural satellite were uncovered by the flights of Amer-
    ican astronauts to the moon and the development in our own country
    of new types of automatic lunar stations.â€ Successful operation of
    U.S.S.R.â€™s Lunokhod I lunar rover represented start of new era envi-
    sioned by Soviet scientists, Keldysh said. U.S.S.R. would emphasize
    unmanned flights with particular stress on long-term orbiting space
    stations.

        In letter to Pravda, group of Soviet cosmonauts said â€œit is our
    opinion that businesslike cooperation of space researchers of different
    countries, including the U.S.S.R. and the United States, should develop
    and grow stronger in the interests of peace and friendship among the
    peoples of our planet.â€
        Soviet Academician Boris N. Petrov said in article reprinted in a
    number of Soviet journals that â€œmain trend of the next development
                                            ...   will probably be as follows:
    of cosmonautics and space exploration
    Further investigation of near-Earth space, studying the Earth from
    space for purposes of space meteorology, geology, agriculture, ocean-
    ology, and marine and air navigation. The task of constructing space
    exploration facilities and the usage of outer space for peaceful pur-
    poses is the favorable basis for fruitful international cooperation
    wherein both big and small countries can effectively participate.â€
    U.S.S.R. had â€˜â€˜always directed its efforts into an arena of peace and
    international cooperation. . . . The time is not behind the mountains
    when the remarkable idea about construction of long-duration, piloted
    orbital stations will be implemented.â€
       Soviet Military Review editorial said Soviet space program had
    demonstrated â€œthe benefiting the whole of mankind and the contribu-
    tion to worldwide progress. The Gagarin flight, as all subsequent
    achievements of Soviet space exploration, demonstrated the organizing
    and guiding role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the
    inexhaustible potentialities of the socialist social system and of the
    Soviet economy, science, and technology. Consistency and purposeful-
    ness are a feature of the Soviet program of exploration in outer space,
    on the Moon and on the planets of the solar system.â€ (Yuenger,

April 20

April 20: Dr. George M. Low, Acting NASA Administrator, and Alan Gotlieb,
    Deputy Minister of Canadian Dept. of Communications, signed agree-
    ment at NASA Hq. for first cooperative international project for experi-
    mental communications technology satellite. Cooperative Applications
    Satellite C (CAS-c)would be launched into geostationary orbit by
    NASA in 1974 to conduct communications experiments with ground ter-
    minals operating at extremely high frequencies, test one-kilowatt solar-
    power-cell arrays that would unfurl in space like window shades, and
    test electric propulsion and stabilization systems. Canadian DOC would
    be responsible for design, construction, integration, and subsystems
    testing of spacecraft and for tracking, data acquisition, command, and
    control of spacecraft after it reached orbit. NASA would provide Thor-
    Delta booster, launch services, superefficiency power tubes and associ-
    ated equipment, and environmental testing of integrated spacecraft.
    Thel\e would be no exchange of funds between DOC and NASA. Project
    was fifth in series of cooperative satellites which began with launch
    of Alowtte 1 Sept. 28, 1962. (NASA Release 71-72)
 National Space Club luncheon honored Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, late NASA
    Deputy Administrator, physicist, and Director of NACA from 1947 to
     1958. Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, said in
    speech: â€œDr. Dryden held that the decentralization of authority was a
    desirable goal and dictatorial control of projects, funds, and facilities
    should be avoided. He knew that ideas and skills would be widely
    dispersed. Even though the goals of applied research and development
    projects were concrete and specific, the approach to these goals had
    to be diversified. Freedom of the agencies and scientists engaged in
    the work was a necessity here, as it was in fundamental research, if
    the best use was to be made of their abilities. These concepts have
    lived and grown, and I believe, still represent the fundamental policy
    for the management of programs at NASA today.â€
       During luncheon, bust of Dr. Dryden, commissioned by National
    Space Club and executed by sculptress Una Hanbury, was officially
    presented to NAS President, Dr. Philip Handler. (Text; NSC News

    and pulled away. Taped pictures released later on Moscow TV showed
    Soyuz 10 moving away from Salyut 1 after docking experiment while
    commentator said : â€œThe principles of rendezvous and docking with the
    use of new equipment were tested and checked out in the course of the
    joint experiment. A rigid mechanical link-up was achieved, followed by
    undocking of the manned ship from the orbital station. After the end
    of this experiment in maneuvering, both vehicles continued to fulfill
    their program.â€ According to information released later, Soyuz 10
    caught up with Salyut 1 in two stages. First stage automatically brought
    Soyuz 10 within 180 m (590 ft) of target vehicle; in second, approach
    and docking were effected manually. After separation Soyuz 10 cir-
    cled Salyut 1 for about one hour, photographing and filming it from
    various angles.

  Perspective in science funding was drawn by Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA
     Associate Administrator, in Science editorial: â€œThe funding proposed
     for 1972 for basic science ($2.4 billion), or even that for the entire
     space exploration program ($3 billion), is a very small fraction of
     the funding that is proposed for efforts to ameliorate societal prob-
     lems today ($90 billion). The real need is not so much for additional
     dollar attention as it is for attention of a different kind. Ideas, new
     approaches, and new insights into the wise management and utiliza-
     tion of our human and natural resources are what is required. Many

    seems an important-as well as expensive-step on the road toward
    that objective.â€ But there was no guarantee that space stations would
    be restricted to benign purposes. â€œLogically, there should be no na-
    tional space stations in space. All such facilities should be operated by

           The rendezvous maneuver began from a long distance away. At
     first we could not see the orbital station and we corrected our orbit
     to get closer. We first saw the Salyut from a distance of about 15 kilo-
     meters [9 mi]. At that distance we were able to see the station through

     ceeded with the rendezvous maneuver.
        â€œAs we approached the station, we kept looking at the station through
     instruments. It was quite an imposing sight. Then the docking took
     place. All the time we kept the required components of the station

        Cosmonaut Boris Yegorov said â€œoperations of docking and rendez-
     vous lead to a considerable emotional burden on the cosmonauts.
     Medical men and engineers are looking for and finding the most
     rational combination of man and automatic equipment in such a com-

     cosmic psychology must be solved to achieve the best possible coordi-

     moved about under moon by tidal forces on earth. Larger quakes were
     too deep to be caused by escaping gas, which led to his theory that
     sublunar volcano caused quakes. He was unable to pinpoint quake

During April: NASA issued Funds for Research, Development, R&D Plant
    and Scientific and Technical Information, Fiscal Years 1970-1972:
    Annual Report to The National Science Foundation. In FY 1972
    budget, NASA was seeking authorization of $3.271 billion. Effect on
    programs would be: Funds for basic research would remain at FY
    1970 level in FY 1971 and rise in FY 1972, reflecting increased
    funding for Viking and initiation of outer planets Grand Tour project.
    In applied research, estimates for FY 1971 reflected 10% increase
    over 1970 and slight increase in FY 1972, primarily for earth re-
    sources surveys and space station. Budget authority for development
    activities would decline in 1971 and 1972, primarily as result of com-
    pletion of Apollo program and reduction in NASA-AEC NERVA program
    effort. R&D funds were requested in FY 1972 for space shuttle tech-
    nology and engine development facilities. (Text)
 AIA Aerospace Research Center published National Technology Support:
    A Study of Research and Development Trends and Their Implications:
    New patterns were emerging in magnitude and direction of R&D in
    US. â€œRecent R&D trends reflect diminishing governmental leadership
    in R&D which could lead to an erosion of the national research effort.
    The impact of continued inflation, the higher costs and longer leadtimes
    associated with increasingly sophisticated projects, plus accelerated
    efforts to meet specific national goals, suggest an even greater degrada-
    tion of the total R&D effort than an examination of expenditures would
    indicate.â€
        Recent growth of industrial financing and leveling of Federal fund-
     ing indicated shift in direction of national R&D activities. (Whereas
     industrial research and development has focused primarily upon prod-
     uct improvement and product development, most of the nationâ€™s basic
     research and the high risk, high cost activity has been financed by the
     Federal Government. Although their respective R&D programs fre-
    quently are complementary, certain technological projects traditionally
     initiated or sponsored by the Federal Government are beyond the
     financial scope of private enterprise. Consequently, a reduction in
     Federal R&D activity could have a negative impact on the level of
    sophisticated effort nationally.â€

    shrouded in uncertainty. Neither amity nor enmity is foreordained.
    Those who proclaim the inevitability of conflict on ideological grounds
    are as wrong as those who assert the inevitability of peace, or even
    friendship, because the United States and the Soviet Union have
    become more restrained in words and deeds in dealing with each
    other. The future depends first of all upon how the two governments
     conceive of their respective interests and how they will go about
    defending and protecting them. If they conceive of them in com-
    patible terms and pursue them with appropriate concern for each
    otherâ€™s sensibilities, the future might well witness the realization of
    Rooseveltâ€™s dream, Stalinâ€™s grand design, and Maoâ€™s nightmare : the

    neers employed in industry dropped from 387 100 to 380 600. Decline
    -first recorded by NSF in 13-yr series of reports, was primarily caused
    by cutbacks in personnel working on Federal R&D programs. Most of
    R&D unemployment among scientists and engineers occurred in aircraft
    and missiles industry. Number of R&D professionals in DOD programs
    remained level between 1968 and 1969. Federal Government was source
    of 47% of R&D dollars spent by industry during 1969, down from 59%

   US. Geological Survey, USN Naval Oceanographic Office, AID, and
   Dept. of State.
      Ambassador George H. W. Bush, U S . Representative to U.N., in
   welcoming address called space technology a global tool and said,
   â€œfor a global tool to be used productively and efficiently, there must
   be a climate of international cooperation.â€ Workshop and U.N. could
   66
     provide policy makers and program managers in developing countries
   with the basic information to enable them to consider seriously how
   this new technology may help them meet their needs.â€
      Dr. William T. Pecora, Under Secretary of the Interior, said in
   keynote address that earth-surveying satellites were â€œmustâ€ for worldâ€™s
   welfare. â€œWhether or not our great population can avoid intolerable
   social problems of a crowded world and maintain the hoped-for living
   standards is a matter of conjecture, but our ability to survive will
   depend in large part on critical assessment of all the earthâ€™s resources.â€
      Leonard Jaffe, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Applications,
   described NASA Earth Resources Aircraft Program ( ERAP) : â€œInstead
   of waiting for data acquired from spacecraft, users are presently
   obtaining multispectral data of Earth phenomena from sensors carried
   by NASA aircraft . . . to evaluate the sensors and to develop a solid
   foundation for observational and interpretive techniques for earth-
   resources space missions.â€ ERAP included RB-57FY P-3AY and C-130B
   aircraft. â€œWe shall shortly add two more high altitude (U-2) aircraft.â€™â€™
   Lockheed C-130B was flying optical and infrared laboratory with
   24-channel multispectral scanner to provide information on signatures
   used to separate, classify, and identify specific earth resources. â€œThis
   is an expansion of the 12-channel scanner of the University of Michi-
   gan C 4 7 aircraft which we also use for the same purposes. The P-3A
   or Electra is our radio-wave instrument development laboratory.â€
   Radio antennas on underside of aircraft were used heavily for oceano-
   graphic and hydrological studies. Since remotely sensed data had to
   be verified with actual ground data, â€œcomplementary ground efforts
   are necessary during the research phase of the program.â€
      In spacecraft program to begin in 1972, â€œERTS satellites will be
   placed into a 920-kilometer [570-mi1, sun-synchronous (near polar)
   orbit. This will permit the satellite, with its narrow-angle sensors, to
   observe the same spot on Earth once every 18 days. It also ensures
   that observations are made with a nearly constant solar-illumination
   angle required for developing identification signatures. The altitude
   permits narrow-angle sensors to be used to obtain virtually undistorted
   images.â€ (NASA Release 71-74; GE Challenge, Summer 1971; Tran-

   turns driving vehicle at maximum 16-km-per-hr (10-mph) speed. Scott
   told press, â€œWe expect this little buggy to work just fine on the moon.
   Itâ€™s really a very straightforward little vehicle, just like driving your
   own automobile.â€ On first LRV excursion, Scott and Irwin would drive

      might have sprung up from the moon with the front,â€ Irwin told
      press. â€œIf we see it and the trail upward looks traversable, we might
      climb as high as 600 ft [180 m] to get to it.â€ Third and last trip on
      third day on moon would take astronauts to edge of Hadley Rille and
      north along ravine to sample crater cluster that appeared to scientists
      to be volcanic in origin. On return, astronauts would park LRV 90 m
       (300 ft) east of LM with TV camera pointed directly at LM. Irwin
      told press if all went well worldwide TV audience would get first live

   Soviet SST. Report by John D. Holmfeld summarized progress of
   Tu-144 from press reports and U S . and U.K. technical journals. Tu-144
   was â€œclearly an aircraft which is competitive with the Concorde.â€ It
   had 27.1-m (89-ft) wing span and Concordeâ€™s was 25.6 m (84 ft) ;
   it was 56 m (184 ft) long and Concorde was 62.1 m (204 ft). Tu-144
   weighed 149 700 kg (330 000 lbs) ; Concorde weighed 174 600 kg
    (385000 lbs). Tu-144 would cruise at 2490 km per hr (1550 mph)
   at 19 800-m (65 000-ft) altitude; Concorde cruised at 2170 km per hr
    (1350 mph) at altitude of 18 000 m (60000 ft) . On New York-London
   route, Concorde flight time was estimated at 3 hrs and 30 min; Tu-144
   probably would require 3 hrs and 10 min. Tu-144 maximum range was
   estimated to be 6400 km (4000 mi). Tu-144 was powered by four
   Kuznetsov NK-144 turbofan engines with 127 480-newton (28 660-lb)
   thrust. Concordeâ€™s four Rolls-Royce Olympus engines had 146 000-
   newton (32 825-1b) thrust. (Text)
May 7-8: Working Group on Philosophy, Science, and Technology met at
   MIT. NASA Associate Administrator, Dr. Homer E. Newell, reviewed
   US. space program: â€œIt is improper, I believe, to claim the ability to
   assess at this time the impact of space on human history. Our involve-
   ment in space has not been an isolated event, nor even a short term
   episode, in manâ€™s growing awareness of his universe and his built-in
   drive to dominate it. Space is simply another dimension of human
   endeavor, of success and failure, of progress and achievement. The
   reasons that the Space Age began when and how it did could be dis-
   cussed at length; the fact of the matter is that we stand now well
   within it, and cannot have the perspective to grasp its full implica-
   tions. But one can discern numerous impacts, many of which con-
   tribute in a variety of ways to our country and to the world. Among
   these contributions have already been: An uplifting of the human
   spirit, with an undoubtedly major impact on the human horizon, the
   scale of manâ€™s thought, and his estimate of his own capabilities. The
   openink of a new frontier. Major advances in technology and in our
   expectation of technology. The development of practical applications,
   with the special long range impact of a quantum jump in communi-
   cations. Substantial contributions to the advancement of science and
   human knowledge. The exploration of our solar system.
      â€œThese benefits are worth a substantial investment of the Nationâ€™s
   resources, not to the neglect of other needs of our Nation and human-
   ity, but as part of our investment in the continuing future and strength
   of our Nation.â€ (Text)

* First detailed Soviet analysis of US.plan for Grand Tour of outer planets
     was reported by New York Times. In Vestnik, principal publication of
     Soviet Academy of Sciences, Soviet space expert Timur M. Eneyev had
     suggested that four missions covering two planets each might be more
     successful than the two missions to three planets contemplated by NASA.
     He indicated Soviet scientists favored approach of delivering automatic
     space stations to outer planets and suspending them by balloons in
     planetary atmosphere. He said technique, â€œfor all its exotic aspects and
     difficulties of realization, is probably the most promising because it
     would yield far more data about the nature of the giant planets than
     could be obtained from fly-by trajectories.â€™â€™ (Shabad, NYT, 5/9/71)
May 10: Dr. James C. Fletcher held first press conference as NASA Admin-

     depended critically on development of new technology. â€œAnd this means
     new technology of all kinds-electronics, computers, materials, as well
                                                             ..
     as military technology. And I think thatâ€™s . . . why NASA . programs
     should be vigorously pursued.â€™â€™ NASA had studied possibility of second
     Skylab and â€œmany other manned missions in space, most of them some-
     what cheaper than the second Skylab; and we intend to look at these
                                                                   ..    . the
     very carefully to see what programs, if any, made sense after
     first Skylab is flown.â€ Dr. Fletcher thought NASA STOL experimental
     aircraft program was â€œlong overdue.â€
        Asked his personal plans for NASA, Dr. Fletcher said, â€œI canâ€™t say
     that I want to go in a new direction from the way NASA has been
     going, except maybe up instead of down.â€ He was interested in inter- .
     national cooperation in space and â€œwhole business of commercial use
     of the things that NASA has been developing,â€ including â€œstrides in the
     applications satellites area.â€ He was â€œgreat supporter of the shuttle,â€

     all kinds of new things you can do in space. Since the costs will be

    of new applications, all kinds of new science programs, new manned,
    near-earth programs, almost anything you can think of can be done
    much cheaper once you have the shuttle developed.â€ With sufficient
    funds, NASA would probably pursue space station. â€œBut in my judg-

    you pick the shuttle first because you have to have that for the

    There was â€œtotal absence of air and water pollutionâ€ in use of solar
    energy. â€œWe are facing an uncertain future as far as energy resources
    and energy converters are concerned. One thing which we have learned
     . . . in the aerospace industry is that one cannot make choices among
    alternatives unless they are all roughly at the same stage of develop-
    ment. Let us make sure that solar energy is brought up to the level
    of the other contenders-lest we make poor choices later on. Solar
    energy is not just a dream-if we will it-it can play a major, bene-
    ficial role in our lifetime.â€ (CR, 6/4/71, S8262)

     airlinesâ€™ investment in SST: â€œThe bill which the SST lobby seeks to
    amend is a Supplemental Appropriations bill that contains money for
    the Governmentâ€™s closing costs arising from cancellation of the contract

     ment to consider its debt of honor to the airlines. They were strongly
     advised by the Department of Transportation in 1967 to advance money
    to the Boeing Company, to be credited against the future purchase of
    SSTâ€™S. The airlines realistically recognized that this was risk capital if
    the plane should prove a technological failure, but in view of the
     Federal Governmentâ€™s insistent if unwise pressure in behalf of the
     plane, they had good reason to rely upon continued Government back-

         work on quiet engines was described by Roy P. Jackson, Associ-
  NASAâ€™s
    ate Administrator, OART, at 1971 Society of Automotive Engineers
    Meeting in Atlanta, Ga.: â€˜â€˜The first objective of our work on design
    principle for quiet engines is an experimental CTOL [conventional-
    takeoff-and-landing] engine and nacelle with 15 to 20 PNdb [per-
    ceived noise in decibels] less noise than the comparable JT3D class of
    engines in service today. Program began in 1969 and would be com-
    pleted by end of 1972. General Electric co. and NASAâ€™s        LeRC were
    working together on program. â€œIt is on schedule and should meet or
    surpass the noise reduction objectives. We believe that production of
    quiet engines using this technology could begin to be available for
                                                   .
    retrofit and new aircraft beginning in 1976. . . Such quiet engine
    installation in aircraft and the size of the 707 and DC-8 could permit
    this class of aircraft to operate fully 10 db lower than the present FAR
    36 standard for new aircraft.â€ NASA expected â€œto continue technology
    that will show how to drive the noise level down another significant
    increment like 6 db within a few years.â€ Aircraft â€œthe size of the 707
    should be able to operate at a noise level of 92 EPNdb [effective per-
    ceived noise in decibels]. Our objective is to develop the necessary
    technology for this by 1977. Production engines meeting such noise
    standards could then be developed by industry through normal devel-
    opment and certification cycles and be available for next-generation
    aircraft of all types beginning in the late 1970â€™s or early 1980â€™s.â€™â€™

   NASAâ€™s scientist-astronauts were -â€˜fuming,â€ Thomas Oâ€™Toole said in
     Washington Post. They had been selected to be members of Apollo
     crews landing on moon, primarily as geologists, and members of Sky-
     lab crews, as physicians, physicists, and chemists. But â€œno geologist
     has landed on the moon yet, and only one has a chance of making it,â€
     Oâ€™Toole said. Among names of nine prime Skylab crew members and
     six backups recently circulated at MSC, three prime and two backup
     members were scientists and â€œthis enraged the scientists who were
     hoping for two-thirds representation on Skylab.â€ Three meetings had

      Scientist-astronauts had asked for more freedom in developing their
      scientific careers. Oâ€™Toole said NASA officials had been said to be sym-
      pathetic, â€œbut the gripe about getting their own experiments aboard
      Skylab fell on deaf ears.â€ ( W Post, 5/17/71, A l )

    trator for International Affairs, during testimony before House Com-
    mittee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on International
    Cooperation in Science and Space: â€œIf a cautious optimism proves
    justified, we can expect definite benefits. Each side will gain access to
    lunar materials from sites additional to those it had explored on its
    own. We will nearly double the coverage of our operational meteoro-
    logical satellites. We shall have created a global network for sounding
    rocket observations of basic importance to world meteorological re-
    search. We shall have demonstrated a mutual participation in earth
    resources survey work. We can greatly expand our knowledge of the
    behavior of man in flight through data on Soviet missions in addition
    to our own. We shall make it possible to avoid any undesirable dupli-
    cation of scientific work in space, to plan complementary missions,
     and to verify anomalous results-all helping us to develop opportu-
    nities for more rational and economic conduct of space science and
    exploration.â€ Successful performance of rendezvous and docking agree-

May 19: U.S.S.R. launched Mars 2 probe toward Mars from Baykonur at
     9:23 pm local time (12:23 pm EDT). At 10:59 pm Baykonur time
      (159 pm EDT) spacecraft was injected into flight trajectory for Mars
     from â€œartificial earth satelliteâ€ in terrestrial orbit, according to Tass.
     Instruments were said to be working normally and flight was said to
     be close to calculated course.
        Primary objective of six-month, 470-million-km (292-million-mi)
     mission, Tass said, was to conduct complex research of Mars and its
     atmosphere and study characteristics of solar plasma, cosmic rays,
     and radiation along Mars route. Satellite was scheduled to reach Mars
     vicinity in November, when planet was 129 million km (80 million mi)

May 20: NASA held Hq. news conference on Mariner status. Dr. George M.
    Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, reported on failure of May 8
    Mariner-H launch. Review by JPL, LeRC, and General Dynamics Con-
    vair Div. personnel had isolated failure to integrated circuit in pitch
    channel of rate gyro preamplifier in Centaur stage autopilot. When
   Atlas-Centaur ignited, â€œamplifier output was . . . only 20 to 40 percent
    of what it should be.â€ Second anomaly had been noted 25 sec after
   main engines started; â€œengines did not gimbal all the way to the stops.
         .
    . . At 1.2 degrees they stopped and hung up. So the signal for the
    first 20 or 25 seconds indicated that the engines oscillated with in-
   creasing amplitude in response to autopilot signals but the signals were
                                                   .
   at a lower gain than they should have been. . . With the engine then
   thrusting at an angle, the vehicle wound up and started tumbling.â€
   Amplifier had functioned properly during checkout 40 min before
   liftoff, â€œso sometime between T-30 minutes and the Atlas sustainer
   engine shutdown ignition of the Centaur stage, this component failed.â€
   Investigators had assumed â€œthat we had in the circuit a failed diode
   or a diode with a loose connection in it, that a voltage transient during
                     .
   powered flight . . then got into the integrated circuit and caused all
   of the other events.â€
       To avoid repetition of anomaly, NASA was â€œsubjecting the autopilot
   cans to additional temperature cycling and vibration testsâ€ to ascertain
   they were operating within limits â€œunder some off-nominal conditions.â€
   New test was being conducted on autopilots for Mariner-I Atlas-Centaur
   23 â€œto make sure that the diodes are indeed there and properly func-
                                                              .
   tioning and properly protecting the integrated circuit . . before we
   fly again.â€
       Failure of three Atlas-Centaurs in 15 flights had led to appraisal of
   LC
      general quality of the vehicle,â€ Dr. Low said. Conclusion â€œwas that,
   if anything, quality has improved. There is no trend away from im-
                    ..
   proving quality. .â€
       Vincent L. Johnson, Deputy Associate Administrator, OSSA, described
   checkout problem with propellant utilization in Atlas-Centaur 23. Short
   had been discovered in system that measured amount of hydrogen and
   oxygen in tanks and controlled flow of each propellant to engine.
   â€œTherefore it became necessary to open the tank and get inside to
   locate the fault, find it and fix it.â€ Reassembly was expected to be
   completed by weekend and five- to seven-day checkout on Mariner-I
   begun. Launch date could occur from May 28 until June 6 with good
   launch windows available. (Transcript)
 Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, reviewed NASA program before

   knowhow will not do much for the country. A slow program may cost
   less, but be worth nothing in terms of meeting the countryâ€™s needs.
   And a slow program-or no program-is all we are going to have with-

    â€œIt would not be safe for the United States, with its great responsi-
    bilities for world peace, to lag behind any other country in space
    technology. This is an axiom we did not quibble about in the â€™60s and
    should not quibble about in the â€™70s.â€ Space program had proved
    â€œexcellent hotbed for forcing new technology, which in turn raises our
    national productivity and prosperity and increases our ability to solve
    pressing social problems of todayâ€™s urban society.â€ Finally, space ex-
    ploration was needed as inspiration for modern man. â€œI think we are
    inspired, and our children are inspired, to be living in an age when
    man first moved out into space and began the exploration of our solar

    parameters is planned in order to increase two or three times, the
    density of the particles and the retention-time of the plasma, which
    is an essential condition for the creation of a thermonuclear reactor.

  At Apollo 1 5 press briefing in Washington, D.C., Astronaut Alfred M.
    Worden, CM pilot, described planned activities in lunar orbit, includ-
    ing first â€œworking walkâ€ in space. At 320 000 km (200 000 mi) from
    earth on return journey from moon, he would move outside CM, hand-
    walk on 7.6-m (25-ft) tether along rail, and open bay in SM to
    retrieve two canisters of film used to photograph moon while space-
    craft was in lunar orbit. It was necessary to retrieve film before SM
    was jettisoned 160 km (100 mi) from earth before CMâ€™S reentry.
    Worden said one hour had been allotted to space walk but underwater
    practice had indicated retrievals could be completed in 20 min. Two
    roundtrips from CM to SM were necessary because only one canister
    could be carried at a time.
       First canister would weigh 36.3 kg (80 lbs) and hold 2000 m
    (6700 ft) of film, including more than 1600 exposures of lunar sur-
    face taken from 113-km (70-mi) lunar orbit. Photos would be en-
    larged on earth to compose blowup 15.2 m (50 ft) wide and 160 km
    (100 mi) long showing details on lunar surface as small as 1.5 m
     (5 ft) in diameter. NASA hoped these would include photo of LRV.
    Second canister would weight 3.6 kg (8 lbs) and hold 1100 m (3600
    ft) of film used in mapping camera.
       While Worden retrieved cannisters, CMâ€™S hatch would be opened.
    Astronaut James B. Irwin would guide Worden along tether and
    Astronaut David R. Scott would stow canisters when Worden passed

May 25: Tenth anniversary of President Kennedyâ€™s message to a joint session of
Congress urging that the United States â€œcommit itself to achieving the goal, before this
decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.â€ The
goal was achieved when Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong, on the Apollo 11 mission, became
the first man to set a foot on the lunar surface, at 1 0 5 6 pm EDT, July 20, 1969.


     mary aim of passive seismic experiment was to discover where moon-
     quakes occurred. â€œSO far we have identified 1 zones in which moon-
                                                     1
     quakes occur, but one of these is particularly active, accounting for
     about 80 percent of the energy we record.â€ Source might be â€œan iso-
     lated pocket of magma under pressure at depths between 30 and 400
     miles [SO and 600 km] .â€ Third seismometer, to be placed on moon by
     Apollo 15, was expected to provide data as to whether all 1 zones 1
     corresponded to same source mechanism ; i.e., small magma reservoirs.
     Active zone fell on line that bisected Apollo 12 and 14 seismometer
     stations, â€œso that makes 15 an exceedingly vital station to us. If we just
     get one perigee passage and a couple of these moonquakes before
     station 12 or 14 ceases to function, weâ€™ll have taken quite a step for-
     ward.â€ Apollo 15 would be at edge of prominent mascon basins,
     Serenatatis and Imbrium. â€œWe expect . . . to impact an S-IVB smack
     in the middle of one of them, probably Serenatatis. So this will be the
     first time we get seismic waves propagating through one of these mascon
     features, and, hopefully, we will be able to say something about how
     its structures differ from the other mare we have been able to record
     seismic waves through.â€

       Edward M. Davin, Program Scientist, Lunar Surface Experiments,
    said Apollo 12 magnetometer had been â€˜â€˜very successfully recording a
    surprising magnetic field. . . . we now have a general model of the
    moon based upon three layers . . . a crust, an inner layer, and a core.â€
    Apollo 15 lunar surface magnetometer could determine â€œif there is
    any asymmetry in the magnetic fieldâ€ and provide additional informa-
    tion on electrical conductivity that indicated thermal distribution of
    lunar interior.
       JPL scientist Dr. Conway W. Snyder said solar wind spectrometer
    experiment would be â€œmeasuring the weather in space. The solar wind
    which is a plasma-this        is an ionized gas-is    quite analogous to
    weather on earth. . . . it is the phenomenon that determines what mag-
    netic fields are in space, affects cosmic rays, and generally is the fun-
    damental entity in space once you stop considering the planets them-
    selves.â€ With addition of second spectrometer on moon â€œwe hope to
    be able to start making some definite interpretations of the very com-
    plicated kind of plasma effects that go on the moon.â€
       Suprathermal ion detector experiment was described by Rice Univ.
    scientist Dr. Kent Hills. ApoZZo 12 and 14 ion detectors had revealed
    ion clouds that were not lunar-oriented but had been formed elsewhere
    â€œfrom an expanding neutral gas cloud.â€ With Apollo 15 experiment,
    third station north of other two would give â€œextended distance with
    which to investigate these things and . . . a different direction.â€
       Cold cathode gauge experiment would indicate amount of gas on
    moon, Dr. Francis S. Johnson of Univ. of Texas at Dallas said. Ion
    detector already on moon had detected gas clouds in which concentra-
    tion sometimes increased 100 times. With second gauge â€œwe hope that
    there will be the prospect o seeing the same event on two gauges, and
                                 E
    then we will be able to tell quite a lot more about where these gas
    sources would be and also learn something about how they propagate
    across the lunar surface.â€
       Heat flow experiment, with 3-m (10-ft) drill, was to measure amount
    of heat coming from interior of moon, Columbia Univ. astronomer Dr.
    Marcus E. Langseth said. Measurement would be made by monitoring
    heat budget in near-surface material (lunar regolith) over one year
    with thermometers on probes about 2 m (6 ft) below lunar surface.
     Measurements could be useful in resolving contradictory data from
    magnetometer experiments on Apollo 12 and 14.
       Experiments outside Apollo 15 ALSEP package-laser ranging retro-
    flector, lunar field geology, and lunar soil mechanics-were discussed
    by Wesleyan Univ. astronomer Dr. James E. Faller; Donald A. Beattie,
    Program Manager, Lunar Surface Experiments; and Dr. James K.
    Mitchell of Univ. of California at Berkeley. Laser array would provide
    third leg of triangle formed by laser retroflectors on ApoZZos 12 and
    14, improve ranging reliability from current stations, and â€œprovide
    for greater efficiencies in telescope use time.â€ Geology experiment
    objectives were to sample Apennine Mountain front, study Hadley Rille,
    examine mare, sample volcanic complex to north of landing site, and
    study cluster of craters southeast of landing site. Soil mechanics experi-
    ment would measure density, strength, compressibility and adhesive
     and cohesive characteristics of material on lunar surface. â€œThe thing
    that is going to be of considerable interest is the lunar roving vehicle

    continuing experiments. By 1:00 pm Moscow time (6:OO am EDT)
    June 13 Salyut-Soyuz station had completed 100 orbits of earth.
       Cosmonauts continued to follow preplanned program of work, rest,
    and two hours of exercise per day and reported they were in good
    health. Experiments included communications with ground via orbit-
    ing Molniya I comsat, astronomical observations, medical experi-

    record set by Soym 9 June 2-19,1970.
       On June 29 cosmonauts completed flight program and prepared for
    reentry. Crew transferred equipment to Soyuz 11 and undocked from
    Salyut 1 at 9:28 pm Moscow time (2:28 pm EDT). Crew reported suc-
    cessful undocking and said all systems were functioning normally. At
    1:35 am Moscow time June 30 (6:35 pm EDT June 29) spacecraftâ€™s
    braking engine was fired for prescheduled period. At end of engine
    firing communication with Soym 11 crew ceased.

    in the atmosphere the parachute system was put into action and
    before landing-the soft-landing engines were fired. The flight of the
    descending apparatus ended in a smooth landing in the pre-set area.
    Landing simultaneously with the ship, a helicopter-borne recovery

    rapidly, I believe-is to attack directly the social, economic, and other
    serious problems of our time that have a definite technological com-
                                   .
    ponent. Problems of ecology . . have technological solutions. Urban
    and interurban transportation have technological solutions. As soon as
    we determine the appropriate political system which will spend the
    time and money, we already know a good deal abaut how to solve
    problems like these, and what remaining technology needs to be devel-
    oped will undoubtedly appear. Other problems such as rural and ghetto
    health, housing, hunger, and poverty, have only a partly technological
    solution ; still others, with strong human and sociological components,
    are even harder to deal with, and it may be a long time before
    problem-solvers learn to deal with â€˜peopleâ€™ problems. . . . while it
    wasnâ€™t easy to land men on the Moon-it was nevertheless a straight-
    forward, engineering kind of problem. And as someone has said, there
    werenâ€™t any people between here and there.â€
        Third path-and he thought few persons â€œyet realize what a broad
    and important path it can be in years aheadâ€-was         â€œto pursue long-
    range study and research on applications of problem-solving techniques

    â€œshuttle propulsion technology has been vigorously pursued in a totally
    organized approach for several years,â€ no major technology work
    remained to be done before shuttle main engine development phase
    began. Designs with strong technical bases were ready to proceed.
     However, if hydrogen propulsion was selected for air-breathing engines
     that would return shuttle stages to landing fields on mission completion,
     additional technology development would add about one year to

June 15-1 7: House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee
      on NASA Oversight held hearings on failure of Atlas-Centaur to launch
     Ats 4 into planned orbit Aug. 10, 1968, and failure to orbit OAB-B
     Nov. 30,1970, and Mariner 8 May 8,1971.
         Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, testified June 15
      on NASA policy on backup spacecraft and Centaur reliability: â€œIn the
     manned program, all possible steps are taken to assure the safety of
      the astronauts. Single point failures are reduced to an absolute mini-
      mum. Missions are planned to build upon the previous missions so as

                                       163

June 15-17

     to reduce the number of unknowns.â€ Within missions, â€œplateaus are
     established so that all systems can be checked out in real time prior
     to committing to the next plateau. Vigorous testing procedures cou-
     pled with redundancy and in many cases dual redundancy are adopted
     before a system is â€˜man-rated.â€™ â€
        In Skylab â€œwe are building a back-up workshop which will be
     brought right up to the point of actual checkout. This will permit
     us to proceed with the program even in the event that the first work-
     shop would not be successfully launched. Similarly, we will have a
     single back-up Command and Service Module-Saturn IB capability
     for the three manned visits to the workshop.â€ Capability was built into
     program and was â€œkey to the plan for a rescue capability in Skylab
     which we recently adopted.â€
        In earth-orbital automated programs â€œwe generally plan a series of
     related missions, using identical or similar hardware. If we have a
     mission failure, decisions will then be made, based on all available
     factors, whether we will (1) prepare and fly a specific back-up to the
     mission which failed, (2) modify succeeding flights . . . to achieve
     the objectives, or ( 3 ) defer achieving the mission objectives to future
     years.â€
        In planetary programs, with launch opportunities at only discrete
     intervals, NASA usually had provided for two identical launches. Each
     launch in dual mission was planned to complement its twin, while at
     same time serving as backup if twin were lost. This year Mariner 9
     was backup, flying hybrid mission.
        Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle had history of 3 failures out of 16
     operational vehicles, without apparent relationship between failures,
     giving probability of success of 80% if based solely on past experience.
     Launch vehicles for automated missions-such        as Scout, Delta, and
     Atlas-Centaur-were â€œcomplex systems without much redundancy, and
      cannot be expected to achieve reliabilities much greater than about
      90% without very major and costly changes. They certainly cannot be
      considered â€˜man-ratedâ€™ vehicles.â€ Addition of redundant systems would
      be investigated again but was not complete solution. Redundancy added
      weight, reduced payload capability, and was expensive. For launch
      vehicles of size of Titan-Centaur, which would carry Viking and Grand
     Tour payloads, additional redundancy might be practicable and desir-
      able and would be actively studied. Major increase in reliability of
      achieving orbit would be one of important attributes of space shuttle.
         Dr. John E. Naugle, Associate Administrator for Space Science and
      Applications, on June 16 continued testimony on backup philosophy,
      expanding on application in OSSA: â€œWe do not schedule backup mis-
      sions for observatory spacecraft. We always buy, and intend to fly, at
      least two flight units of a new series of observatory-class spacecraft.
      When we have a failure or a malfunction in a spacecraft or a launch
      vehicle we will always do everything possible to thoroughly under-
      stand and correct all other future missions which could conceivably be
      subject to a similar malfunction. When we have a failure we will al-
      ways review the effect of the loss on the program, determine the alter-
      native recovery plans by which we can attain the objectives of the lost
      mission, assess the cost and any other impact of those alternatives on
      the program and then decide which alternative to choose.â€

         Vincent L. Johnson, Deputy Administrator for Space Science and

     establish the philosophical approach to reliability of unmanned space
     vehicles, the over-riding necessity for protection of the lives of human
     passengers is absent. The result is an approach to reliability in which
     cost and simplicity play a much larger part. We have not imposed a
     requirement for total elimination of single point failure modes, but
     have concentrated upon reducing the probability of failure by careful
     design, parts application, major quality and reliability efforts, and,
                                                                   ..

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1971

    1970 total solar eclipse, astronomical observations from space, use of
    stratospheric balloons in space research, and lunar lasers.
       Grumman Aerospace Corp. scientist Dr. Henry C. Courten, pro-
    fessor of astronomy at Dowling College, said mysterious tracks on
    photographic plates he made during 1966 and 1970 solar eclipses
    appeared to be of small planet or asteroid belt inside Mercuryâ€™s orbit.
        Cal Tech scientist and lunar expert Dr. Gerald J. Wasserburg told
    COSPAR meeting four rocks gathered by Apolb 14 astronauts had
    ages ranging from 3.85 billion to 3.95 billion yrs. Ages were sur-
    prising â€œsince it was anticipated that Fra Mauro would yield rocks of
    greater antiquity.â€ Discovery suggested that volcanism was active on
    moon far longer than had been thought and was still forming lunar
    crust more than 600 million yrs after moon came into being. It also
    suggested that Sea of Rains had been carved by collision 600 million
    yrs after moonâ€™s formation, or 100 million to 150 million yrs later
    than lunar experts had originally believed.
        Soviet scientists Yuri G. Nefyuduv, L. I. Kakurin, and A. D.
    Yegorov said Soyuz 9 Cosmonauts Andrian 6. Nikolayev and Vitaly I.
    Sevastyanov â€œfound it difficult to keep the upright posture and had to
    be assisted while walkingâ€ during first three hours after return from

    quate and erect positions were maintained with great efforts.â€ When
    cosmonauts returned to physical activity, few days after flight, effects
    of prolonged weightlessness had proved temporary.
        Astronaut John W. Young represented U.S. astronaut corps at cere-
    mony to honor 10th anniversary of first space flight by Soviet Cosmo-
    naut Yuri A. Gagarin. He asked, â€œWhat better tribute to the memory
    of Yuri Gagarin can we offer than the hope that the growing unity of
     efforts in space-which    this COSPAR meeting so well exemplifies-
    may one day extend to all the Earth? (NAS Release, 4/21/71; AP,

June 18: Discoveries of identical, complex patterns of amino acids and
     pyrimidines in two meteorites might indicate basic phase of chemical
     evolution leading to origin of life, ARC scientist Dr. Cyril A. Ponnam-
     peruma told meeting of New York Academy of Sciences. Team of ARC
     scientists had found that Murray meteorite that fell in Kentucky in
     1950 had same 18 amino acids, plus two pyrimidines, as were dis-
     covered in December 1970 in Murchison meteorite (which fell in
     Victoria, Australia, in September 1969). â€œStarting with these 18
     amino acids, it would be theoretically possible to build up a living or-
     ganism.â€ Discovery appeared to be first conclusive proof of extraterres-
     trial chemical evolution, strengthening case for chemical evolution
     theory and increasing likelihood of life elsewhere in universe. (NASA

     sources as saying. Reportedly Fedoseyev had been refused asylum at
     Le Bourget Airport in Paris by French officials, who later relented and
      allowed him to proceed to NATO Hq. in Brussels aboard USAF helicopter.
      Fedoseyev was believed to be one of highest ranking Russians to defect
      to West-vice minister in charge of space research for Soyuz and
      Luna spacecraft programs. Sources had further reported that 80 mem-

June 21 : Extrasensory perception tests aboard Apollo 14, launched Jan. 31,
     were described by Apollo 14 Astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell during press
     conference at Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man at
     Durham, N.C. In unauthorized experiment, Mitchell had tried to send
     messages to four â€œreceiversâ€ on earth while en route to moon. He had
     carried cards bearing ESP test symbols and concentrated on random
     order of cards while receivers on earth wrote down order in which
     they believed he was â€œtransmitting.â€ While plan had called for â€œtrans-
     missionâ€ once daily for six days, Mitchell had been able to perform
     experiment for only four days. Two of his receivers had reported
     (4
        receptionsâ€ for all six days, one for one day only, and another for
     two days. Mitchell said preponderance of wrong answers was signifi-
     cant because it was â€œso far below chance that the odds are approxi-
     mately 3000 to one against it being a chance result.â€ If it was not
     chance, Mitchell said, results indicated â€œextrasensory exchange.â€
     Mitchell declined to identify his receivers, but Olof Johnsson of Chicago
     had said he was one psychic who had participated. (AP, NYT, 6/22/71,

     of Berkeley, where the corporation has its headquarters.â€ Hope for
     McDonnell Douglas â€œrests in large measure with the companyâ€™s plans
     to produce the F-15 fighter-bomber. Already Congress is looking at

    Boris N. Petrov, Chairman of Intercosmos Council of Soviet Academy
    of Sciences. Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, MSC Director, headed NASA group
    participating in meetings provided for in US.-U.S.S.R. agreement

  Jamaican and U.N. officials visited MSC to review data acquired by NASA,
    Jamaican Geological Survey, and US. Geological Survey during earth
    resources survey of Jamaica made in April at request of Jamaican
    government and U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization. NASAâ€™s
    instrumented C-130 aircraft had gathered data on Jamaica water sup-
    ply. Jamaica had average 508-cm (200-in) annual rainfall but much
    mountain river water never reached reservoirs. It was believed that
    submarine springs carried portion of water offshore into Caribbean
    Sea. Allen H. Watkins, Manager of MSC Earth Observations Aircraft
    program, said excellent data gathered on flights had been supplemented
    by most nearly complete â€œground truthâ€ operation yet attempted by
    MSC aircraft program. During MSC visit, Jamaican group was trained
    by NASA to use equipment needed for later analysis of data in Jamaica.

June 23: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, testified before Senate
    Committee on Appropriationsâ€™ Subcommittee on HUI), Space, and Sci-
    ence during hearings on NASA FY 1972 appropriations bill. He urged
    that â€œstrong program in space and aeronautics is essential to our long-
    term national well-being. Our capabilities as a Nation to deal with
    domestic problems of high priority-poverty,        cities, the environment
     . . . and indeed, our pursuit of happiness and cultural advance-ulti-
    mately depend on whether we can maintain a strong economy with
    continually increasing productivity. Increasing productivity, in turn,
    depends primarily on technological advance, which, in turn, results
    primarily from the large scale focussed technological efforts like our
    major space programs.â€
        In addition were both long-term and near-term direct benefits, many
    already realized. â€œWhen 50,000 lives were saved as a result of satellite
    advance warning at the time of hurricane Camille, the space program
                             .
    probably paid for itself. . .
        â€œI believe that the space program is a value in itself to the nation
    and to the whole world. With our everyday preoccupation, necessarily,
                                                                          .
    with the many serious and often depressing problems we face . .
    there is, I believe, a human hunger for positive elevating goals to
    work for at the same time as we do what needs to be done in all these
    other difficult areas. I believe the strong attraction that the landing
    of the first man on the moon had on people everywhere, and much of
    the underlying basis of support in the country for the space program,
    stems from the fact that the space program provides such goals. The
    space program gives us goals seemingly beyond human capability,
    goals which transcend earthly boundaries.â€™â€™
        Space shuttle had tremendous impact for future because it not only
    reduced cost by being reusable itself, but it also gave options of reusing
    payloads. â€œYou do not have to throw them away once you put them
    up there. . . . There are many more application satellites we can use
    with this kind of an arrangement, because we will be able to reuse
    them.â€
       Skylab, â€œfirst and only NASA experimental space station,â€ due to fly
    in 1973, would be â€œlarger but 2 years later than the Soviet Salyut
    now in orbit.â€ U.S.S.R. probably would be able to â€œdo things in space,
                                            .
    laboratories, 2 years earlier than we . . to know what the earth is
    like, to know what the clouds are like, to understand more about the
    earthâ€™s resources. . . . Another aspect, which I am uncertain about,
                                                      .
    is what they plan to do in a military way. . . they will have the
    potential of doing military things on this same vehicle. We do not
    plan to do this on the Skylab. We also must consider the scientific
    value of Salyut, which I think is important, but not as important to
    us as the applications and the military aspects of it.â€
       Associate Administrator for Organization and Management Richard
    C. McCurdy testified that â€œmodelsâ€ of anticipated further reduction of
    1500 civil service positions in fall â€œindicate that we have reached a
    point in which really good people of considerable experience will be
    going out the door. Certain parts of our operations will be closed. This
    means that we have come to a place where reductions in force are
    eating into our capability to do the job.â€ (Transcript)

  NSF released Federal R&D Expenditures Related to Budget Functions,
     1960-72. Between 1960 and 1972 chief areas of Federal R&D funding
     had been defense, space research and technology, and health-totaling
     86% of estimated R&D expenditures of $15.7 billion for 1972. In 1960
     same three categories had totaled 95% of $7.3-billion R&D funding.
     Throughout 1960-1972 period, these three functions had led in R&D
     expenditures in same order. Ratio of R&D expenditures to total Federal
     budget outlays rose from 8.5% in 1960 to 12.4% in 1965. Ratio had
     decreased each year since 1965 and 7.4% estimated for 1972 was
     lowest in 1960-1972 period. Decline reflected more the absolute in-
      crease in total Federal outlays since 1965-from $111 billion to esti-
     mated $211 billion in 1972, excluding interest-than     any substantial
     absolute decline in R ~ expenditures. These expenditures rose from
                                D
      $13.8 billion in 1965 to $16.3 billion in 1968, but dropped back to
     $15- to $16-billion range after that.
         Defense consistently accounted for bulk of R&D expenditures but its
      share fell from 87% of Federal R&D total in 1960 to 53% in 1966,
      when space expenditures peaked. Later defense share increased but
      leveled off from 1968 at 57% to 58% of total Federal R&D. Space

June 2830: AAS 17th annual meeting in Seattle, Wash., was devoted to
    exploration of outer solar system.
        JPL astronomer Dr. Donald G. Rea said Jupiter was biggest enigma
    and challenge to most space scientists. It â€œemits about three times as
    much energy as it receives from the Sun. It has a magnetic field 20
    times that of Earth, intense radiation belts, and apparently rotates at
    three different speeds. An important characteristic for flight projects
    is its gravity which will allow us to send a spacecraft to study Jupiter
    and then continue onâ€ to investigate outermost planets of solar system.
        JPL scientist James E. Long recommended spacecraft be launched

    backup parts for each unit that might fail. Easton said STAR computer
    was spacecraftâ€™s brain and CATS computer its nervous system. Self-
    repairing computers were needed for outer planetary mission because
     6â€˜
      potentially hazardous environments, such as the asteroid belt between
    Mars and Jupiter, or radiation from Jupiter itself, require that Grand
    Tour spacecraft subsystems be self-adaptive to either transient or per-

    communications delay from Neptune or Pluto.â€

    10 years of â€˜delivering the goodsâ€™ in an unparalleled manner, culmi-
    nating in manned exploration of the Moon, the space program is fight-

    taining attitude stabilization. Current predictions indicated nitrogen
    gas supply would be depleted in early August 1972, nine months after
    spacecraft went into orbit around Mars. Increased rate of consumption
    was due to circuit design error in attitude-control-system electronics.

     of environmental systems as systems. Because existing data and current

  US. manned space flight program would continue on schedule despite
    Soyuz II tragedy, Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, MSC Director, told press in

       Dr. Charles A. Berry, MSC Director of Medical Research and Opera-
    tions, said cosmonauts could have been killed by a toxic gas that acci-
    dently escaped, either by a chemical reaction or by a substance being
    heated inadvertently. He said odds were 1000 to 1 against one cosmo-
    naut dying from effects of 24 days of weightlessness and it was almost
    impossible for all three to die simultaneously from weightlessness.
       Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, told press cosmo-
    nautsâ€™ deaths might have been caused by failure of spacecraftâ€™s
    oxygen-supply system or by physical rupture of spacecraft. Deaths,
    he said, were â€œa terrible tragedy. They were pioneers in their achieve-
    ments in space-in establishing the first manned space station. Our
    hearts go out to their families and to their colleagues. The cause of
    their death is not yet known to us. But I would speculate that the
    fault was with the spacecraft and not with the men. In all of our ex-
    perience man has readily adapted to new conditions, while machines
    have sometimes failed.â€ Dr. Low said he did not expect changes in
    NASA% Skylab program because of cosmonautsâ€™ deaths: â€œAll of our
    experience in 24 manned flights suggests we can and should move
    ahead.â€ (UPI, W Star, 7/1/71, A3; NASA Activities, 7/15/71, 107)

     has made discoveries of fundamental significance and has shifted con-
     siderably the limits of phenomena in the universe known to man.

     some years ago has led to the conclusion that the objects noted are
     located almost on the edge of the observable area of the universe at
     a distance of 5 billion light years. The power of radiation exceeds all
     currently known scales. In order to explain the colossal energy they
     radiate from the standpoint of the most powerful known mechanism
     for emitting energy-thermonuclear synthesis-it is necessary to sup-
    pose that its source must be simultaneous thermonuclear explosion of

     the accumulating technological knowledge of mankind to protect them.

                                 1
     nations-for    the moment chiefly the United States and the Soviet

     does not proceed from their numbers-three deaths next to, say, thou-
     sands among the worldâ€˜s more recently savaged refugees. Nor does it
     proceed alone from their conspicuous bravery, their willingness to
     take the ultimate risk in pursuit of a national mission: daiIy, men in
     combat make the same commitment and do so minus the glory and
     unambiguous sense of purpose that cosmonauts and astronauts share.
      So it is more than the death of three men on a high risk venture that
     must move the earthbound to a special sorrow: it is the death of these
     men in pursuit of the ultimate adventure, exploration of the outer

     pleting a complex and varied program oi scientific research and tech-
     nical experiments. The results of their observations are invaluable for
     science, for the future of space technology, fcr mankind. For 24 days
     we saw the valorous cosmonauts on the television screens and listened
     to their voices. With unbated attention we followed their work. Mil-
     lions of people, as it were, became intimately linked with the heroes of
     the cosmos. We all impatiently awaited the cosmonautsâ€™ safe return to
     home territory. Their lives tragically came to an end when the long
     cosmic journey was close to completion.â€
        Letter from 19 surviving cosmonauts printed in Pruwdu said: â€œTo-
     day we are paying the last tribute to our talented and courageous com-
     rades. There is not only grief in our hearts, but also pride for what
     they have done for the homeland in outer space. We know that our
     road is a difficult and thorny one, but we never doubted the correct-
     ness of our choice and were always ready for any difficult flight. We
     express firm confidence that what happened cannot stop the further
     development and perfection of space engineering and manâ€™s striving
     for space, striving for knowledge of the mysteries of the universe.â€

     the edge of a new era in the life of scientific societies as social organ-
     isms, an era in which both general and scientific politics feature un-
     ashamedly in the raisons dâ€™etre of reinvigorated and reorganized gen-
     eralist scientific societies.â€ (Science, 7/2/71,27-31)
  NSF published Unemployment Rates for Scientists, Spring 1971. Rate
     was 2.6% in 1971, jumping from 1.5% in 1970. National unemploy-
     ment rate for all workers for first quarter 1971 averaged 6.5%.
     Doctorates experienced 1.4% unemployment rate in 1971 and 0.9%
     in 1970, while nondoctorate scientists were reported at 3.570 rate in
     1971 and 2.9% in 1970. Defense and space constituted largest areas
     of activity, with 11% and 4% of unemployed. Approximately 45%
     of 1971 unemployed scientists reported last science-related job had
     been supported to some degree by Government funds. (NSF Highlights,

July 4 : Boris Petrov, chairman of Soviet Intercosmos Scientific Council
     on Space, said in Pravda that deaths of Soyuz 11 cosmonauts would
     not halt U.S.S.R.â€™s manned orbital space station: â€œNew flights into
     space, the building of new manned orbital stations of the Salyut type,
     lie ahead. Undoubtedly, larger and more complex multipurpose and
     specialized manned space stations will be built. One can say with
     confidence that the 1970s will become an epoch of the development
     and broad use of long-term manned orbital stations with changing
     crews which will make it possible to switch from occasional experi-
     ments in space to a regular vigil by scientists and experts in space
     laboratories.â€ (UPI, NY News, 7/5/71, 7)

  Pravdu article said prospects were good for US.-U.S.S.R. agreement in
     SALT, which resumed in Helsinki July 8, but stressed that agreement
     must provide â€œequal securityâ€ for both nations. â€œAction is met by
     counteraction. If one side strengthens its defense, then the other fever-
     ishly looks for new, more powerfuI means to pierce the defensive
     shield of the opponent. This process, if it is not stopped with the help
     of reasonable agreements in curbing the arms race, is endless.â€ (NYT,

     ments to monitor solar electromagnetic and uv radiation continuously
     and to measure, on command, stellar radiation from other celestial
     sources. Information gained by satellite was expected to contribute to
     better understanding of physical processes in solar flares and other
     solar activities and potential effects of this activity on shortwave com-
     munications and on manned space travel. Satellite was third in series
     of solar radiation satellites launched from Wallops Station in joint
     NASA-NRL program. Two previous satellites were Explorer 30 (Solrad 8,
     launched Nov. 19,1965) and Explorer 37 (Solrad 9, launched March 5,
     1968). Solrad program was sponsored jointly by OSSA and Naval Air
     Systems Command, with NRL providing project management for mis-
     sion. (NASA Proj Off; NASA Release 71-115; WS Release 71-13)

  Boeing Co. was reactivating 767 project that was â€œsimmering on a back
     burnerâ€ while SST was alive, William Hines said in Washington
    Sunday Star. Project â€œborrows liberallyâ€ from NASA aircraft develop-
     ment work. Boeing 767 subsonic jet would be about same size as
     Boeing 707, with same passenger capacity, but would be more than
     160 km per hr (100 mph) faster. Cruising speed would be 1167 km
    per hr (725 mph) or mach 0.98, â€œabout the greatest achievable with-
    out generation of a sonic boom.â€
        LaRc Director Edgar M. Cortright had said aircraftâ€™s speed was
    attributable to its supercritical wing that could operate at speeds near
    mach 1 in shockproof condition. Boeing spokesman had said aircraft
    could be in service by end of decade. Hines said Boeing also was con-
    sidering production of stretched version of 727. (W Star, 7/11/71, D4)
Jdy 12: U.S.S.R. announced findings of special commission which investi-
    gated deaths of S o y a I I cosmonauts during reentry from June 6-30
    mission. Official report distributed by Tass said spacecraftâ€™s flight had
    proceeded normally up to descent trajectory, with cosmonauts Georgy
    T. Dobrovolsky, Vladislav N. Volkov, and Viktor I. Patsayev perform-
    ing according to flight program. About 30 min before landing â€œthere
    occurred a rapid drop of pressure within the descent vehicle, which
    led to the sudden death of the cosmonauts. This is confirmed by the
    medical and pathologico-anatomic examinations. The drop in pressure
    resulted from a loss of the shipâ€™s sealing. An investigation of the
    descent vehicle, which made a soft landing, showed that there are no
    failures in its structure.â€ (Tass, FBIS-SOV-133-3, 7/12/71, L1)

     Even though there are atmospheric scatterers in addition to the

    ments were part of Lightning Strikes to In-Flight MissiIes program
    to test conductivity and electrical field breakdown strength on Minute-
    man and Atlas missiles. Scientists theorized that exhaust plume acted
     as electrical conductor and might have influenced electrical fields in
    thunder clouds and provoked lightning stroke.

    that â€œthe rocket plume acts as a good conductor of electricity-like a
     wire . . . stretched from the rocket to the ground. And, should the
     rocket enter a thunder cloud, it would act like a lightning conductor.
     In the Apollo 15 launch weâ€™re primarily interested in the effective
    length of the conducting plume. The rocket is 363 feet [110 m] long,
     and the visible portion of the plume, which contains incandescent car-
    bon particles and other burning matter, is perhaps another 500 ft
     [152 m] of good conductor. However the trailing invisible portion
     may also be electrically conductive and thatâ€™s what we want to find

       most of the publicly available data and commentary on the events
     surrounding President Kennedyâ€™s decision in May 1961 to commit the
     United States to effecting a lunar landing before 1970.â€ Logsdon
     seemed to conclude that â€œbecause the decision process somehow corre-

  GAO published Comparison of Military Research and Development Expen-
     ditures of the United States and the Soviet Union. Report quoted
     Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as
     saying much Soviet R&D was likely to have been directed toward mili-
     tary and space programs. Spin-off to civilian industry in U.S.S.R. was
     considered to have been small because all invention and innovation of
     military application, while in principle available for civilian use, was
     surrounded by impenetrable security blanket. Consequently, strain of
     R&D effort had been much greater for Soviet economy than for that
     of US. (CRY7/31/71, E8607-81)

     Congress to provide emergency loan guarantees for major business
     enterprises confronted with temporary financial stringencies : â€œThe ad-
     ministration originally sought legislation only to help the Lockheed
     Aircraft Corporation. That support is still needed very badly. But I
     have instructed Secretary of the Treasury Connally . . . to accept the
     broader legislation. It wouId be most useful in providing a systematic
     procedure for helping any major business enterprise with temporary
     financial problems whose failure would adversely affect the economy

landing mission, returning them with 77 kilograms (170 pounds) of samples after
66 hours 55 minutes on the moonâ€™s surface. During prelaunch activities in Firing
Room 1 of the Kennedy Space Centerâ€˜s Launch Control Center, Dr. James C .

     amps had occurred June 25, and last-weakest to date at 6600 amps-
     had occurred July 19. Neither spacecraft nor launch vehicle had been
     damaged. Apollo 15 was first spacecraft to have even a near miss from
     lightning strikes while being prepared for launch. (W Post, 7/25/71,

                            Apollo 15 (AS-510) carried three-man crew on
July 26-August 7: NASAâ€™s
     fourth successful lunar landing mission. LM-10 Falcon landed on
     moonâ€™s Hadley-Apennine region and two astronauts conducted experi-
     ments, rode first manned lunar roving vehicle (LRV) on moon, and
     explored lunar surface. After 66 hrs 55 min on surface, Falcon re-
     joined orbiting CSM-112 Edeavor and astronauts transfered for safe
     return to earth with lunar samples.
        July 26-28: Spacecraft-carrying Astronauts David R. Scott (com-
     mander), Alfred M. Worden (CM pilot), and James B. Irwin (LM
     pilot)-was launched from KSC Launch Complex 39, Pad A, on time
     at 9:34 am EDT July 26 by Saturn V booster. Launch was watched by
     2000 invited guests-including 185 members of British Astronomical
     Society and Royal Astronomical Society and 41 Congressmen-and
     estimated 1million other viewers.
        Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with
     171.4-km (106.5-mi) apogee and 169.4-km (105.3-mi) perigee. Trans-
     lunar injection (TLI) was achieved at 2:56 GET and CSM separated
     from LM/S-IVB/IU at 3:22 GET. Docking of CSM with LM at 3:34 GET
     was shown clearly by onboard color TV.

       First midcourse correction (MCC-1) was canceled because space-
    craft trajectory was near nominal. Shortly after CSM-LM docking,
    telemetry data indicated electrical sh        service propulsion system
     (SPS). Troubleshooting isolated pro           d MCC-2 at 28:41 GET

    bank A could be safely                nually. Modified procedures were
    developed for using bank B alone for remaining midcourse corrections
    except lunar orbit and transearth insertions, which would be dual
   bank burns.
       Scott and Irwin entered LM at 33:56 GET, 50 min earlier than
   planned, to check out LM communications and other systems. TV pic-
   tures of CSM and LM interiors were shown between 34:55 and 3 5 ~ 4 6
   GET. During checkout crew discovered range/range-rate exterior glass
   cover had broken, removing helium barrier. Crew began LM house-
   keeping 1% hrs earlier than scheduled and vacuumed broken glass.
   At 61 :13 GET, during preparations for water chlorination, water leak
    developed in CM chlorination septum gland but was stopped by crew,
   following repair instructions from ground, and water was absorbed
   with towels. Door of scientific instrument module (SIM) was jettisoned
   at 74:06 GET.
       J d y 29-August 4: Apollo 15 entered lunar orbit with 314.8-km
    (195.6-mi) apolune and 107.5-km (66.8-mi) perilune after LOI burn
                                                                   ...
   at 78:32 GET (4:06 pm EDT July 29). â€œThis is really profound          itâ€™s
   fantastic,â€ Scott said of view from moon. Apennine Mountains looked
   unreal. â€œThey stand out in tremendous relief. They appear to be smooth
   or rounded. But they are cratered and in many places rough in texture.
                                                            ..
   We donâ€™t see any jagged peaks. They donâ€™t look like . any other
   mountains weâ€™ve seen on earth.â€
       CSM-LM undocking and separation maneuver was initiated during
    12th lunar revolution, on far side of moon at 100:14 GET, but space-
   craft did not undock. Worden entered tunnel to inspect CSM-LM um-
   bilical and found plug was loose. After he reconnected plug and
   adjusted spacecraft attitude, undocking and separation were achieved
   at 100:39 GET-about 25 min later than planned.
       LM Falcon touched down in moonâ€™s Hadley-Apennine region near
   Salyut Crater at 104:42 GET (6:16 pm EDT July 30) about 600 m
    (656 yds) north-northwest of planned target. â€œOK Houston,â€ Scott
   said after touchdown, â€œthe Falcon is on the plain at Hadley.â€ He said
   LMâ€™S engine had stirred up so much dust that landing site had been
   completely obscured from 15-m (50-ft ) altitude to touchdown: â€œWe
   dew IFR from then on down.â€                                  \
       Stand-up extravehicular activity (SEVA) to observe and photograph
   landing site and surrounding area began after cabin depressurization

July 29-August 4: Apollo 15 entered lunar orbit July 29 and the LM Falcon touched
down in the moonâ€™s Hadley-Apennine region July 30 for three EVA periods of
exploration. The lunar roving vehicle Rover, deployed during the first EVA July 31,
was photographed by Astronaut James B. Irwin near Hadley Rille (right center above),
with the Hadley Delta in the background and St. George Crater partially visible at
the upper right edge. Astronaut David R. Scott was working at the Rover. In the
photo at right Irwin scooped a trench, with Mount Hadley in the background. A
gnomon indicated the local vertical and the sun angle. Meanwhile CM pilot Alfred M.
Worden, orbiting the moon in Endeavor, completed lunar and astronomic photography.

     for hours. Area was covered with craters, but strewn with very few
     large boulders; it was hilly, but not rocky or rugged.
        First EVA began July 31 at 9:04 am EDT. Scott climbed down ladder,
     deployed MESA containing camera which recorded his descent, and
     stepped on lunar surface. Irwin followed and, while Scott removed TV
     camera from MESA and deployed it on tripod, Irwin collected contin-
     gency sample. Crew had difficulty deploying LRV Rover; during check-
     out they found that front steering mechanism was inoperative and that
     there were no readouts on LRV battery No. 2 amp-volt meter. Battery
     was found to be operating satisfactorily and decision was made to
     perform EVA-1 without LRV front-wheel steering. Crew mounted LRV
     and proceeded on EVA-1 traverse at 121:45 GET. Crew described EVA
     as â€œexploration at its greatest,â€ and repeatedly used words â€œfantastic,â€
     â€œbreathtaking,â€ and â€œspectacularâ€ to describe features as they rode
     LRV at about eight km per hr (five mph). Scott said Rover handled
     quite well: â€œIt negotiates small craters quite well, although there is a

    Stops at stations where crew collected lunar samples and took photos
    were broadcast on TV with excellent transmission. At end of traverse
   ALSEP was deployed. Scott and Irwin reentered LM after 6 hrs 33 min
   exploring surface, 28 min sooner than planned because Scott used up
   more oxygen than anticipated.
      After resting inside LM, recharging and repairing portable life sup-
   port system (PLSS), and reviewing plans for second EVA, astronauts
   left LM at l42:15 GET (7:49 am EDT Aug. 1). LRV was powered up,
   circuit breakers were cycled, and LRV front steering was found to be
   completely operational. EVA-2 traverse included stops at Spur Crater,
   Dune Crater, Hadley Plains, and area between Spur and Window
   craters. Numerous samples and photos were obtained and TV trans-
   mission was good. Crew completed heat flow experiment initiated dur-
   ing EVA-1, collected core sample, and deployed U.S. flag. After stow-
   ing sample container and film in LM, astronauts reentered LM at 1499327
   GET, after 7 hrs 12 min on surface during EVA-2.
      Third EVA began at 163:18 GET (4:52 am EDT Aug. 2), 1hr 45 min
   later than planned because of cumulative changes in surface activities
   timeline. Late start and requirement to protect nominal liftofâ‚¬ time
   required shortening EVA. Alternate EVA plan was devised with traverse
   west from LM to Hadley Rille. Astronauts traveled to Scarp Crater,
   â€œThe Terraceâ€ near Rim Crater, and Rim Crater, collecting samples
   and photographing lunar surface features. Scott tripped over a rock

     and fell, but experienced no difficulty in getting up. Astronauts re-
     trieved drill-core-stem sections and samples near ALSEP, returned to
     LM, off-loaded LRV and stationed it for TV coverage of LM liftoff, and
     reentered LM at 168:08 GET, after 4 hrs 50 min-bringing total EVA
     time to 18 hrs 35 min.
        While LM was on moon Worden, orbiting moon in Endeavor, com-
     pleted lunar and astronomic photography and prepared for rendezvous.
     His observations included discovery of fields of cinder cones made by
     volcanic eruptions, delineation of landslide or rock glacier on north-
     west rim of crater on lunar farside, interpretation of ray-excluded zone
     around crater Proculus as result of fault system, and discovery of layers
     on interior walls of several craters, suggesting volcanic collapse craters
     of calderas in maria.
        Scott and Irwin depressurized LM, discarded excess equipment, re-
     pressurized LM, and lifted off lunar surface with 77 kg (170 lbs) of
     lunar samples at 171:34 GET ( 1 : l l pm EDT Aug. 2)-66 hrs 55 min
     after landing on moon. Liftoff, accompanied by USAF anthem â€œOff We
     Go Into The Wild Blue Yonderâ€ taped and broadcast by astronauts
     from LM, was photographed in color by camera on LRV left on moon
     and was seen by millions of TV viewers. Spacecraft docked success-
     fully at 173:36 GET, as TV viewers watched. Scott and Irwin trans-
     ferred from LM to CSM with samples, equipment, and film. CSM-LM
     separation and LM jettison were delayed one revolution to verify that

   Apollo 15 ALSEP site. Impact was recorded by Apollo 12, Apollo 14,
   and Apollo 15 seismometers.
      Orbit-shaping maneuver was performed during "3rd lunar revo-
   lution in preparation for subsatellite launch. Scientific subsatellite was
   launched at 222:39 GET (4:13 pm EDT Aug. 4 ) into lunar orbit with
    141.3-km (87.8-mi) apolune and 102.0-km (63.4-mi) perilune. Hex-
   agonal, 36-kg (80-lb) satellite 79 cm (31 in) long and 36 cm (14 in)
   in diameter carried three experiments and was housed in SIM bay
   with seven other new experiments. Satellite extended three 11/-m
    (5-ft) booms, one with magnetometer to measure interplanetary and
   earth magnetic fields near moon and two for stabilization. Satellite also
   carried charged-particle sensors and equipment to detect variations in
   lunar gravity caused by mascons.
      Transearth injection maneuver at 223:49 GET put cSM on trajectory
   for home after 85 hrs 18 min (74 revolutions) in lunar orbit.
      August 5-7: At 241:58 GET (11:32 am EDT Aug. 5) Worden left
   CSM for inflight EVA to retrieve panoramic and mapping camera film
   cassettes from SIM on SM. He made three trips to SIM bay, two to
   retrieve cassettes and one to observe condition of instruments, re-
   entering CSM after 38-min 12-sec EVA.
      CM Endeavour separated from SM at 294:44 GET. Drogue and main
   parachutes deployed but one of three main parachutes partially closed
   during descent, causing harder landing than expected. CM splashed
   down in mid-Pacific about 10.1 km (5.5 nm) from recovery ship

   ried by helicopter to biomed area on recovery ship for post-flight
   examinations. After being declared in very good shape, astronauts
   were flown on following day to Hickam AFB, Hawaii, and to Ellington
   AFB, Tex. CM was retrieved and placed on board recovery ship. Lunar
   samples, data, and equipment were flown to Elliigton AFB, and CM
   was off-loaded at San Diego.

July 26: President Nixon issued statement on successful Apollo 15 launch:
     â€œThe flight of Apollo 15 is the most ambitious exploration yet under-
     taken in space. Even as it reflects manâ€™s restless quest for his own
     future, so it also reenacts another of the â€˜deeper rituals of his bonesâ€™-
     not only the compulsion of the human spirit to know where we are
     going, but the primal need in manâ€™s blood to know from what we
     have come. We hope, by this journey, to know better the origins of
     Earth, the moon, and their other planets. We hope to understand
                                                                         ..
     something more of the mysteries of Godâ€™s great work. And .               we
     hope to understand more of man himself.â€ (PD, 8/2/71, 1088)

August 7: Safe splashdown--with an extra bump. The Apollo 15 command module,
completing its 1%-day lunar mission, descended to the waves on two of its three
parachutes. The third parachute collapsed, increasing impact velocity to 35 km
per hr (22 mph), but did not endanger the astronauts or the spacecraft.

    astronauts in MSC briefing for their completion of EVA geological
    activities: â€œI donâ€™t think there is any question that we had a fan-
    tastic exploration mission. Thereâ€™s just no question in my mind we
    sent two very competent observational scientists to the moon.â€ Sam-
    ples collected, Schmitt said, â€œsounded very much like . . . crystalline
    rocks . . . that may well, and I emphasize may . . . represent the early
    lunar crust. I am not sure until we see the samples that weâ€™re much
    closer to understanding the origin of the rille than when we started,
    except that there probably are some origin theories that can be
    eliminated now.

    preliminary thinking about the moon . . . still looks like a valid pic-
    ture, itâ€™s a valid foundation [on] which to attempt to further select

  Apollo 15 LM Falconâ€™s liftoff from moon was described by Tom Wicker

     moments when a huge Saturn rocket rises majestically into space
     from Cape Kennedy. The quick pop that sent off the Falcon in a
     shower of sparks looked more like something held over from the
     Fourth of July, and the part of the landing craft left on the moon was
     all too suggestive of an auto graveyard.â€ Two years after first moon-
     walk, â€œAmericans do not . . . seem nearly so interested as they were

    of outer space.â€ (Reuters, NYT, 8/8/71)
  Philadelphia Inquirer editorial praised Apollo 15 crew : â€œTheir workman-

     commentary, gave Scott and Irwin good credits for showmanship as
    well as technical expertise. And the superb orchestration from mission
     control in Houston with Joseph Allen directing the score with the
    precision of a maestro on the podium, added an esthetic touch to a
     performance that should win raves from drama critics as well as space
     buffs. All concerned with Apollo 15 rate the nationâ€™s applause for an
     almost flawless performance thus far.â€ ( P Znq, 8/7/71)
  Arcas sounding rocket launched by NASA from Ft. Greely, Alaska, carried
     GSFC experiment to obtain ozone measurements in conjunction with
     Nimbus 4 satellite overpass. Because of problems with ground tracking
     equipment no telemetry signal was received from payload until rocket
     reached 27-km (16.8-mi) altitude on descent side of apogee. Radar
     did not acquire rocket or ejected payload and payload was not recov-
     ered. Flight, first in three-flight series, was rated partially successful.
     Second and third rockets in series would be launched Aug. 9 and 14.

  Newspapers published preliminary summary of Apollo 15â€™s scientific and
    technical achievements. Thomas Oâ€™Toole said in Washington Post: â€œThe
    voyage of Apollo 15 did far more than extend manâ€™s reach into the
    heavens. It showed dramatically that man belongs in space. At the
    end of their three days on the moon and six in lunar orbit, the astro-
             .
    nauts . . had gathered more scientific information about the moon
    than all the manned and unmanned spacecraft that had flown before
    them.â€
       Cameras and instruments in SIM had made first extensive observa-
    tions from lunar orbit. One of first findings was confirmation that
    moon was not perfectly round and was dimpled. Evidence from seis-
    mometer was backed up by bistatic radar in which spacecraft signals
    were used to penetrate lunar surface to core. Seismometerâ€™s reception
    of LMâ€™S impact on moon indicated that even small explosion or impact
    could be recorded at extreme range and verified earlier hypothesis that
    meteorite impacts were being recorded daily from all over lunar surface,
    Addition o i Apollo 15 station to existing seismic net completed triangu-
    lar array of instruments for determining focal points of moonquakes.
       Data from cold cathode gauges at Apollo landing sites and mass
    spectrometer in orbiting Endeavour confirmed presence of thin lunar
    atmosphere. Spectrometer picked up pockets of neon and argon and
    scooped up carbon dioxide that had apparently burst from fissure near
    where sun was lighting lunar surface at daybreak. Other data obtained
    by Endeavourâ€™s instruments indicated lunar highlands were rich in
    aluminum and deficient in magnesium. Waterless basins were rich in
    magnesium and deficient in aluminum. Most highland regions con-
    tained three times as much aluminum as lowlands, and one mountain-
    ous region had five times as much aluminum as typical lunar basin.
    Magnetometer on subsatellite launched into lunar orbit discovered
    moon had electromagnetic boundary layer. Camera system recorded
    data for comprehensive map of areas never before flown over, with
    details and resolution previously impossible.
       Report by Astronauts David R. Scott and James B. Irwin o terracing

    along sides of Hadley Rille identical to terracing noted on sides of two
    tallest mountains in Apennine group-Hadley Delta and Mt. Hadley-
    suggested mountains and Hadley Rille had been thrust up from moon
    by internal pressures that built up inside moon when object the size
    of state of Rhode Island struck moon and created Sea of Rains 4 billion
    yrs ago. Scientists had previously thought Hadley Rille to be younger
    than mountains and independent of their formation. Samples might hold
    clues to sunâ€™s history and its effects on earth climate, past and future.
       Walter Sullivan said in New York Times: â€œSun-determined changes
    in the earthâ€™s climate have controIIed manâ€™s history, from the ice ages
    that plagued the cave men to the desiccation that buried Middle East-
    ern civilizations, not under invading armies but invading sands. By
    understanding the role of the sun in these past events, man may be able
    to assess the effect our parent star will have in determining climates
    of the future.â€ (W Star, 8/8/71, AlO; W Post, 8/8/71, B1; NYT,

     tage. But the programâ€™s brilliant success has made obsolete the nation-
     alistic considerations that seemed so important in the early 1960â€™s. Now
     it is evident that lunar exploration and eventual settlement offer rewards
     and challenges for all mankind. Do Washington and Moscow have the
     courage and imagination to begin makingthat prospect a reality?â€
     (NYT, 8/8/71)
        Washington Post: â€œThere seems to be very little doubt that the mis-
     sion completed yesterday by astronauts Scott, Irwin and Worden has
     been the most productive in the history of the Apollo program. The
     yield of scientific data has already been large and much more is sure
     to come as laboratories around the world analyze the rocks, pictures

  U.S.S.R. had in past year â€œbecome the potential target of a vastly in-
    creased number of nuclear bombs and missile warheads,â€ Washington
    Sunday Star noted. While US. was menaced only by Soviet nuclear
    weapons, U.S.S.R. had become â€œfirst to be put at a disadvantage in
    the game of nuclear proliferati~n.~~    France and China had begun
    deploying missiles that could reach targets within U.S.S.R. but not
    targets in US. Franceâ€™s first squadron of nine intermediate-range
    nuclear missiles had become operational Aug. 4. Another nine were
    to be added. Missiles carried 100-kiloton warhead-five       times as
    powerful as atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima-and sufficient range
    to reach some major industrial cities of U.S.S.R. Communist Chinese
    had deployed small number of medium-range nuclear missiles and
    US. experts thought they were not concentrating on development of
    intermediate range and intercontinental missiles.
       US. had 100 Minuteman missiles, 50% of which would carry up
    to three warheads; 54 Titan missiles; 41 submarines carrying 16 mis-
    siles each, with 31 submarines being converted to carry 10-warhead
    Poseidon; and 470 strategic bombers. U.K. had 3 Polaris submarines;
    40 Canberra V-8 bombers; and 2 aircraft carriers with 80 Buccaneer
    strike aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons. French also had

Augmt 9: Dr. Charles A. Berry, MSC Director of Medical Research and
     Operations, told press at MSC that preliminary examination of Apollo
     15 crew had revealed astronauts were in good health, but were not
     returning to normal as rapidly as expected. Examination had also
     revealed that Astronaut David R. Scott had ruptured blood vessels
     under four fingernails-apparently during first EVA on moon. Ruptures
     had resulted from increased pressure on fingers from spacesuit as Scott
     moved his arms to conduct experiments. Although Scott had mentioned
     some discomfort to his hands after EVA-1, officials had assumed dis-
     comfort was typical hand cramp experienced by previous astronauts.
     Dr. Berry said Scottâ€™s injury was not serious enough to warrant space-
     suit modifications: â€œItâ€™s just one of those things that youâ€™ve got to put
        ...  with, and we keep trying to make suits better all the time, and
     up
     I think this current suit is probably as far along the line to being

     in the Apollo 15 site is that indeed the lunar history is in part cata-
     clysmic.â€ Dr. Gast said photos of Apennine Mountains confirmed that
    mountains wereformed out of same collision that created Sea of Rains
    north of mountain range, involving another body as big as state of
     Rhode Island. â€œWe theorized that this would be the case,â€ Dr. Gast

* ApoZZo 15 Astronauts David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and Alfred M.
     Worden held press conference at MSC, during which they showed films
     and described mission. Irwin and Scott praised performance of LRV
     Rover and said it had exceeded their expectations. Showing film taken
     from Rover during traverse, Irwin said he hoped simulated ride didnâ€™t
     make viewers seasick. Ride on LRV, he said, â€œis kind of a combination
    of a small rowboat in a rough sea and a bucking bronco.â€
        Scott said only change he would recommend for Rover was â€œsome
    manner of strapping yourself in the vehicle other than just pure seat
    belts.â€ He also said moon should be explored to far greater extent
    than was currently planned, with :â€˜a whole base of scientistsâ€ and â€œa
    Rover that can carry 6 to 10 men. I think we can . . . establish bases
    on the moon similar to those in the Antarctic and explore it and dis-
     cover a vast amount of data that we donâ€™t even know we have up
    there.â€
        Core sample drilling, Scott said, was â€œone of the best things we
    ever did on the moon. It was very difficult, very time consuming and
    at times it was rather perplexing . . . because we did not expect the
    regolith or the surface material to be quite as well integrated or
    packed as it was. There was nothing wrong with the equipment, it
    was just that we encountered the unknown. And we had to compen-
                      ..     . thatâ€™s why man goes to the moon. His subjective
    sate for that and
    mind can evaluate the situation and come up with a fix far better
    than a machine. The machine would have stopped. It would have
    never gotten the drill.â€
        Scott said in closing, â€œWe went to the moon as trained observers . . .
    to gather data, not only with our instruments on board, but with our
                                                                 ..
    minds, and Iâ€™d like to quote a statement from Plutarch . : â€˜The
    mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be lighted.â€™â€
        Astronauts later revealed they had left plaque and tiny silver figure
    of a fallen man on moon as memorial to 14 astronauts and cosmo-
    nauts who had died in pursuit of space exploration. Plaque, bearing
    names of eight astronauts and six cosmonauts, had been left in small
    crater about 6 m (20 ft) north of rille. (Transcript; AP, B Sun,

 LRL geologists Dr. William C. Phinney and Dr. Paul W. Gast described
    anorthosite rock from Apollo 15 sample bag No. 196 to press at MSC
    lunar sample briefing. Dr. Phinney, praising crewâ€™s descriptions of
    samples, said â€˜Lasin all cases so far where weâ€™ve looked at what the
    rocks are, it matches exactly what the astronauts said it was. Itâ€™s
                                                          .

    about fist size, 269 grams-1/-lb-anorthosite
    plagioclase.â€ Grain was quite coarse, 1-cm (0.4-in) grains, â€œabout the
    coarsest grain size of any lunar rocks that weâ€™ve seen so far.â€ Its
    milky-white color suggested â€˜â€˜that it has probably undergone a fair
    amount of stress, maybe a shock type of deformation.â€
        Rock, popularly called â€œGenesis rock,â€ was significant because it
    supported hypothesis that moon had been extensively molten with
    anorthosite crystallizing from liquid, floating to top, and producing
    anorthositic crust. Although discovery did not prove hypothesis, Dr.
    Gast explained, it was â€œa long step in the directionâ€ of determining
    moonâ€™s origin. â€œIf results on the dating of this anorthosite and some
                               .
    of the chemistry on it . . turn out that all point to the fact that it is
    essentially 4.6 or 4.7 billion years old, which is the time that we think
                         .
    the moon formed, . . it gets to be rather difficult to argue with the
    hypothesis.â€ (Transcript )
August 13: Dr. Charles A. Beiry, MSC Director of Medical Research and
     Operations, described Apolb 15 crewâ€™s medical status to press at
    MSC. Astronauts James B. Irwin and David R. Scott had suffered brief
    periods of irregular heart rhythm on moon, probably as a result of
     extreme fatigue. Irwin also had dizzy spells in space. Arythmic heart-
    beats and dizziness had not been disclosed to press earlier, Dr. Berry
     said, because tests were still being conducted and complete informa-
     tion was not known. Until Aug. 13 Irwin was still suffering from
    effects of weightlessness; he still had mild dizzy spells and, when lying
     prone, felt as if his bed were tilted downward about 30Â°. Astronaut
     Alfred M. Wordenâ€™s medical data during transearth coast EVA had
     been close to predicted, and Worden was adjusting better than Scott
     and Irwin.
        None of the three, however, had returned to preflight norms, but
     there was â€œno medical dangerâ€ as far as crew was concerned. â€œThings
     from past space flights were all going in a pattern and now suddenly
     these guys donâ€™t fit the pattern.â€ In assessing astronautsâ€™ return to
     normal it was important to note how Apollo 15 differed from previ-
     ous manned space flight missions. Important factors were longer time
     spent on lunar surface, longer lunar orbit stay time, and longer time
     spent in 100% oxygen atmosphere.
        Heartbeat irregularities, which had lasted about 10 heartbeats, were
     usually associated with fatigue, low potassium level, and increased
     adrenalin flow-all of which were present in astronauts. Because of
     fatigue levels of which astronauts were often unaware, flight surgeons
     were considering recommending that first EVAS on Apollo 16 and
     Apollo 17 be shortened. (Transcript; AP, NYT, 8/14/71, 1)

 New York Times editorial noted that U.S. planned to cut back on Apollo
   program to fund space station and shuttl hile U.S.S.R. Sulyut I was
   already in orbit: â€œIn effect, the unique         ican capability to land
   men on the moon is being abandoned ahead of the original schedule
   so that this country can concentrate on an attempt to compete with
   what already exists under Russian auspices. To make it even more
   bizarre, when and if both countries have rival manned space stations
   in orbit, each is likely to suspect the other of using these installations
   for military as well as civiiian purposes. This is a prospect that liter-
   ally borders on lunacy.â€ (NYT, 8/13/71,26)
August 13-14: New York Times published series of three articles by
   Apollo 15 astronauts describing the July 26-Aug. 7 lunar-landing
   mission.
       Astronaut David R. Scott said excitement of being on moon came
    in waves: â€œThey are gentle swells, the kind that stop you, buoy you,
    but never sweep you off course. The wave enveloped me the moment
    our lunar module, Falcon, cleared the peaks of the Apennines and
    pitched over for our final descent to the moon.â€ Greatest thrill had
                                                .
    been discovery of anorthosite rock: â€œ. . I radioed to mission con-
    trol, â€˜I think we found what we came for.â€™ I must confess that the
    sight of that rock, sitting there millions of years waiting for our
    arrival, set off another wave of excitement for me. It triggered an
    emotion much like finding The Easter Egg. You know, there are lots
    of eggs spread across the lawn, but thereâ€™s only one golden one, and
    there it was-The Golden Egg.â€
       Astronaut James B. Irwin said, although others might describe
    moon as barren and desolate dead world, â€˜â€˜it can be a beautiful one
                                                        ...   When I first
    to anyone who loves the mountains of earth.
                                .
    climbed down the ladder . . I was really taken back by those moun-
    tains [that] almost encircled Hadley Base. They seemed so close and
    so tall. But the real surprise was that the mountains, at first sight,
    were not grey or brown as I had expected. They were golden. Looking
    to the south and east, I saw the reflection of the early morning sun
    glancing off the mountains, especially Hadley Delta, giving them a
                                                                          ..
    glow of gold. It seemed like a friendly place, which surprised me.
    you would have thought we would have felt a little lost, a little out of
    place. But no, I felt that I was where I should be. I knew exactly
    what to do, after more than a year of training, and I felt right at
    home.â€
       Astronaut Alfred M. Worden compared orbiting moon in CSM with
    â€œriding in a free air balloon, floating over the countryside. You are
    suspended. You have no sensation of motion unless you look down
    and see the lunar landscape sweeping below you. At times, I thought
    of myself as a bird, soaring without sound, seemingly detached from
                         ..
                          . one of the most important observations from
    all that is below.
    Apollo 15, as f a r as Iâ€™m concerned, is the apparent evidence of a
    great deal more volcanic activity in the moonâ€™s past. In our training

    we studied and discussed volcanoes . but I guess I wasnâ€™t really
    prepared for the magnitude of the volcanic evidence I saw on the
   moon.â€ (NYT, 8/13/71,1; 8/14/71,1)
August 14: Arcas sounding rocket launched by NASA from Ft. Greely,
    Alaska, carried GSFC payload to obtain ozone measurements in con-
   junction with Nimbus 4 satellite overpass. Ozone payload and ground
    telemetry tracking equipment functioned satisfactorily. Payload was
    recovered and good data were collected. Launch was last in three-
    flight series that began Aug. 7. (NASA Rpt SRL)
 Chicago Tribune editorial commented on Apollo 15 crew: â€œOut of all
    they saw, collected and recorded by camera they hope to make a
    significant contribution to science and the understanding of the uni-
    verse, and they hope from this to apply what they learned to the
    betterment of life on earth. If there is one regret, it is, as Scott said,
    that after the vista from this peak of experience, what comparable
    mountain remains to be searched?â€ (C Trib, 8/14/71)

    astronaut Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt in Apollo 17 crew: â€œExploration
    of the moon can be scientifically justified as a great and extremely

    the worldâ€™s whole scientific community can agree regarding the ori-
    gins and age of the moon, the earth, perhaps the entire solar system.â€™â€™

August 16: Franceâ€™s Eole (CAS-1) Cooperative Applications Satellite was
    launched by NASA from Wallops Station at 2:39 pm EDT. Four-stage
    Scout boosted spacecraft into orbit with 906.1-km (563.6-mi) apogee,
    677.8-km (421.2-mi) perigee, 100.7-min period, and 50.2O inclination.
       Primary NASA objectives were to place spacecraft into appropriate
    earth orbit to obtain meteorological data from balloons and to analyze
    meteorological data acquired from constant-density surface balloons for
    study of characteristics and movements of air masses. Secondary NASA
    objective was to acquire technology of satellite range and range-rate
    system for locating free-moving balloons.
       The 85-kg ( 187-lb) satellite-developed by Franceâ€™s Centre Nationale
    dâ€™gtudes Spatiales (CNES) and named for mythical God of Winds-
    would collect information on wind, temperatures, and pressures from
    up to 500 instrumented balloons flying at 1 900-m (39 000-ft) alti-
                                                    1

    Argentine personnel from three sites in Argentina, could be interro-
    gated by Eole day and night, individually, in sequence, or in pro-
    grammed group of up to 64 at a time.
       Eoleâ€™s meteorological objectives were to study circulation of atmos-
    phere from tracks of balloons, provide basis for standard reference
    system of pressure and temperature to be used in World Weather
    Program, and learn more about local winds. Mission would prove
    feasibility of modified Doppler system plus range measurements to

      determine accurately location of each balloon and prove out super-
     pressure balloon design and lightweight, frangible balloon-borne elec-
     tronics.
        Eole was launched under May 27, 1966, Memorandum of Under-
     standing between CNES and NASA with no exchange of funds. CNES
     designed, built, and tested spacecraft and balloons and would manage
     balloon launchings, spacecraft tracking, data acquisition, and data
     processing. NASA provided launch vehicle, prelaunch support, launch
     operations, and initial tracking and data acquisition. Data would be
     analyzed simultaneously by CNES and by Eole Data Interpretation
     Group comprising representatives of NASA, CNES, NCAR, NOAA, and
     UCLA. (NASA Proj off; NASq Release 71-144)

 August 16-ZU: Working Group on Remote Measurement of Pollution met
     at LaRC to investigate remote sensing in identifying and monitoring
     contaminants. Group reported trace gases were amenable to remote
     sensing, water pollutants could be measured in limited number, and
     remote measurement of specific particulate pollutants would follow
     only after improved understanding of their physical, chemical, and
     radiative properties. Remote sensing could provide essential informa-
     tion in all three categories that could not be obtained from other
     sources. Satellites and aircraft could obtain overall picture of global
     or regional pollution from gases but were inappropriate for local
     measurements because of inability of instruments to measure gases
    in upper atmosphere.
        Group recommended global measurement from satellites of gases
    contributing to ozone photochemistry and radiative equilibrium; study
    to establish feasibility of measuring these gases with current tech-
    niques in stratosphere and troposphere; acceleration of research on
    application of remote sensing to water pollution ; coordinated physio-
    optical research program to advance level of understanding of optical
    properties of real atmosphere ; immediate measurement of earthâ€˜s
    albedo, reflected electromagnetic radiation ; and establishment of
    global network of atmospheric turbidity-monitoring sites to determine
    any changes in worldwide turbidity due to man-made particulate
    matter. (Remote Measzcrement of Pollution, NASA SP-285)

    tinued public interest and certain impressions that the government
    may be concealing factual data on the SST program.â€ Report recom-
    mended â€œtermination of the development contracts and the withdrawal
    of Government support from the SST prototype program.â€ Reasons
    given were: SST operating costs would exceed those of then-available
    subsonic aircraft ; â€œattendant surcharge makes the airline market un-
    certainâ€ ; program was unattractive to private financing and â€œsub-
    stantial government involvement is likely to be sought in the supply
    or guarantee of some $3-5 billion of capital for the certification and
    production of a U S . SSTâ€ ; there was â€œsubstantial uncertainty regard-
    ing the range and payload and the environmental effectsâ€ of SST and
    â€œcosts and duration of the program are both likely to increaseâ€™â€™ in
     attempt to develop production aircraft; there was â€œsubstantial doubt
    that the present configurations of the Conmrde and the TU-144 will
    become commercially viable aircraftâ€; balance of payments argument
    was not sufficiently strong to warrant Government investment in SST ;
     U.S. leadership in aviation did not depend upon affirmative SST deci-
     sion in near future; and, â€œwhen the right combination of technology
    and market demand appears, the US. aircraft industry may well decide
    on its own to proceed with the development and production of an
    SST.â€ (Text)

  Data obtained during Soviet Zond missions from September 1968 to
    October 1970 were described by Soviet scientists, including Oleg
    Gazenko of Academy of Sciences, in Moskovskaya Pravda article, Tass
    reported. Zond spacecraft had carried turtles, drosophilas, onions,
    wheat and barley seeds, chlorella strains, intestinal bacilli, and other
    objects. Total dosage of radiation had been same for all flights. After
    return to earth turtles were active and had good appetite. During
    experiments they lost 10% of weight. â€œSome blood tests . . . and
    electrocardiographs did not reveal essential divergencies from control
    animals.â€ Morphological and histochemical analyses of organs and
    tissues of turtles aboard Zurzd 5 (launched Sept. 15, 1968) had re-
    vealed changes in glycogen and iron content of liver and structural
    changes in spleen. Subsequent experiments had not confirmed findings.
    Flight conditions had given rise to â€œcomparatively large increase in
    the number of chromosome changes in the seeds of pine and barley,
    and a rise in the mutants of chlorella strains.â€ (FBIS-sov-71-161,

    it always made sense. Therefore, any congratulations to [NASA~ for
    finally putting one of the flying geologists to work might be accom-
    panied by a raise of eyebrows over the obvious tokenism of the
    assignment and a reproachful question as to why they waited so long

August 20: No viable organism and no evidence of fossil material had
    been found in Apollo 14 lunar samples, Lunar Sample Preliminary
    Examination Team reported in Science. Major findings had been :
    only 2 of 33 rocks had basaltic textures; samples differed from earlier
    lunar rocks and from their closest meteorite and terrestrial analogs in
    chemical content; chemical composition of soil resembled that of
    rocks ; rocks displayed characteristic surface features and shock
    effects similar to those of Apollo 11 and 12 samples; concentration
    of solar-wind-implanted material in soil was large, as in ApoZZo 11
    and 12 material, but solar wind contents of rocks ranged from that
    of soil â€œto essentially zeroâ€; carbon content of Apollo 14 rocks was
    within range of that for ApoWo 11 and 12 rocks; four fragmental
    rocks showed surface exposure time about an order of magnitude
    less than typical exposure times of ApoZZo 11 and 12 rocks; broader
    range of soil mechanics properties had been found at Apollo 14 site
    than at Apollo 11 or 12 sites and Surveyor landing sites; and no evi-
    dence of biological material had been found in Apollo 14 samples to
    date. (Science, 8/20/71, 681-93)

     State Dept. ceremonies. Signatures of three more original members
     were required for two-thirds majority necessary to inaugurate new
     agreement providing for gradual relaxation of U.S. control.
        Under permanent charter INTELSAT Assembly of Parties, prime
     organ of multitiered organization, would meet biennially and take
     decisions with one vote for each nation. Annual Meeting of Signa-

     Directors would meet at least four times a year to vote on design,
     development, construction, establishment, operation, and maintenance
     of space segment. No single Board member could cast more than 40%
     of total vote; decisions would be taken by two-thirds majority; and
     nonveto provisions had been written into charter. U.S. had agreed to
     relinquish unilateral veto power it had under interim arrangements.
     Permanent charter created new executive organ to assist Board of

    hands could pick up rocks and examine them under the television
    eyes, and, if desired, put them in a hopper for eventual transmission
    back to earth. The vehicle might then rendezvous with another that
    has earth-return capability and hand over the contents of the hopper
    to it. While this type of vehicle would allow us to explore almost all
    regions of the moon, manned missions have been severely limited
    both in the type of terrain for the landing and the distance that astro-
    nauts can travel from their spaceship.â€ Scientists had favored use of
    telefactor with sample-return capability but â€œthe very success of the
    Apollo program had diverted attention from it.â€ Now that no â€œreally
    purposefulâ€ manned program was planned, Dr. .Gold asked, â€œwould
    not this be the right time for really learning how to do good remote
    control ? â€ (NYT Magazine, 8/22/71 )
August 23: ApoZZo 15 Astronauts James B. Irwin, Alfred M. Worden, and
    David R. Scott addressed National Press Club luncheon in Wash-

    and appearance at U.N. Scott called for greater cooperation in space
    and said he looked forward to flight with Soviet cosmonaut. â€˜â€˜I know
    six cosmonauts personally, and I would be glad to fly with any one
     of them any day. And I hope we get that chance.â€ Scott said core
    sample 3 m (8% ft) long he had brought from moon contained 55
     separate layers of soil that illustrated last 2.4 billion yrs of lunar
    history. Layers, discovered through x-ray examination, would show
    changes occurring over billions of years in sunâ€™s radiation as it hit
    lunar surface.
       Later, in telephone interview with Washington Post, LRL scientist
    Dr. John F. Lindsay said layers ranged in thickness from 12.7 mm
     (1/2 in) to 127 mm ( 5 in) with each stratum probably representing
    different meteorite impact on lunar surface. While no analysis of core
    could be made until it was opened by geologists in January, Dr.
    Lindsay said x-rays had indicated that Scott had not drilled through
    solid rock. (UPI, NYT, 8/24/71, 25; Auerbach, W Post, 8/24/71, A3)

  USN participation in space shuttle program was urged by L/Cdr Preston
     E. Beck (USN, Ret.), in U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings. U S N expe-
     rience had shown close parallel between life support criteria and fuel
     management for nuclear submarines and that required for space shut-
    tle. USN Office of Naval Research (ONR) and USN Systems Command
    should determine feasibility of using air entrainment, hydroskis, skids,
    and hydrofoils to permit sea-level landing point for shuttle spacecraft
     with one or more engine inoperable after reentry. Sea transport and
    barge storage of fuels and oxidizers for shuttle spacecraft would
    ensure safety of flight personnel and minimize interference with
     commercial air traffic. Space shuttle orbiter and booster structures
     could be moved only by flyout or by sea because of size. â€œThe obvious
    answer is final assembly at the launch site using a seaborne logistic
     system.â€ Naval Air and Material Center had facilities for develop-
    ment of space shuttle materials, testing of components and subassem-
    blies, and supporting engineering. It seemed pertinent â€œthat the Navy
    take the initiative in starting to support the space shuttle program. The
    key to many of the problems now being subjected to resolution is the
    sea.â€ ( U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, 8/71, 103-5)
  Electrical power development for space was summarized by AIAA Electric
    Power Systems Committee in Astronautics & Aeronautics article :
    â€œBatteries have continued to be employed beyond Explorer I for
    either primary power or as an element of power subsystem. Silver-
    zinc batteries provided 13.5 kilowatt-hours (Kwh) of electrical energy
    for the Mercury spacecraft, up to 63 Kwh for the early Geminis, and
    65 Kwh for the Apollo Lunar Module. Specific energies have advanced
    to 90 watt-hours per pound (wh/lb) f198 wh per kg] in unmanned
    Agena vehicles. The continuing flight dependence on batteries was
    dramatically illustrated by the rescue phase of the Apollo-13 mission,
    which used the LM batteries for power after the failure of the cryo-
    genic supply of the Service Module fuel cell system. Undoubtedly,
    batteries will remain a vital independent power source in manned
    missions and perhaps unmanned missions for many years.â€ Committee
    recommended that â€œcompetitiveness of the isotope and reactor systems
    â‚¬or powers in the tens of kilowatts be encouraged rather than in-
    hibited and that the technology programs for both be kept viable,â€™â€™
    felt â€œthat achieving acceptance of a reactor power system for manned
    Earth-orbiting missions presents a major challenge to the power com-
    munity in the 1970s: and criticized lack of resources â€œto pursue
    effectively all of the advanced reactor power-system options that have
    been carried along most of the 1960s.â€ (A&A, 8/71, 22-30)

                            September 1971

September 1: Preliminary results of Apollo 15 scientific experiments were
     reported by principal experimenters at MSC press briefing.
        Columbia Univ. scientist Dr. Gary V. Latham reported that three-
    station seismometer network completed on moon by Apollo 15 had
     detected 39 events, including â€œmost significant event weâ€™ve recorded
     on the moon.â€ Event was moonquake 800 km (500 mi) beneath sur-
     face-greater depth than for any quake recorded on earth-about 644
     km (400 mi) west of crater Tycho. ApolZo 15 seismic data also had
     revealed that swarms of quakes occurred on moon as they did on
     earth. Most intense swarm recorded â€œcontained 30 events over a period
     of just 2 and a half days . . . at very regular intervals, at about 2 hour
     spacing, and culminated in the largest moonquake yet recorded.â€
     Dr. Latham, Apollo programâ€™s chief seismic investigator, said data
     from missions to date had proved â€œthat we can place long life geo-
    physical observatories on the moon and they can exist years, which
     means that we can expect to maintain a network of stations with
    larger spacing between missions.â€
        Two heat probes drilled almost two meters (almost six feet) into
     surface had shown that moon was hot, with heat concentrated deep in
     interior or in pockets of radioacthe mineral 160 km (100 mi) below
    surface. Temperature of moon increased 0.56 K (1Â°F) each foot
     deeper into moon, indicating heat flow from interior was one fifth
    earthâ€™s heat flow. Columbia Univ. scientist Dr. Marcus E. Langseth
    said this evidence showed that abundance of radioactive minerals in-
    side moon was at least comparable to abundance inside earth. It also
    suggested moon and earth were formed at same time from same
    elements.
        Cal Tech scientist Dr. Leon T. Silver and US. Geological Survey
    scientist Dr. Gordon A. Swam said Apollo 15 had discovered green
    rocks on moon composed of magnificently colored spheres of green
    glass. Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of MSC Planetary and Earth Sciences
    Div., said 75 kg (165 lbs) of ApoZZo 15 lunar rocks had been logged
    to date and would be distributed to investigators. (Transcript; Oâ€™Toole,

September 2-11 : U.S.S.R. launched Luna 18 unmanned lunar probe on
     Proton booster from Baykonur at 6:41 pm local time (4:41 pm Mos-
     cow time, 9:41 am EDT), inserting vehicle into translunar trajectory
    from earth orbit. Tass said purpose of mission was to carry out fur-
     ther scientific research of moon and near-moon space. During flight
     to moon 29 communications sessions were held with spacecraft and
     data on parameters and systems were transmitted. Midcourse maneu-
     vers were conducted Sept. 4 and 6 and on Sept. 7 Luna 18 entered
    lunar orbit with 99.8-km (62-mi) altitude, 1-hr 59-min period, and
     35â€ inclination. Spacecraft made 54 revolutions of moon, testing
    methods of automatic near-moon navigation, before braking for moon
    landing.

  US. and British space experts believed purpose of four Cosmos launches
     in past 10 mos was to test components for manned lunar landing,
    New Yorlc Times reported. Cosmos 434, launched Aug. 12, was said
    to have been test of variable-thrust, restartable rocket engine similar
    to onboard propulsion system in Apollo CSMS. Other launches identified
    by experts were Cosmos 379, Nov. 24; Cosmos 382, Dec. 2; and Cosmos
    398, Feb. 26. Crucial hardware believed to be missing from launches
    was Saturn V-size booster. Some of these spacecraft had traveled
    farther in space than previous Soviet flights testing manned spaceflight
    equipment ; at least three, including Cosmos 434, had demonstrated
    greater ability to maneuver in space than any previous Soviet manned

     discovery of Soviet launch site at Plesetsk in 1966, had said in tele-
    phone interview with Times that â€œthe Russians have never made orbital
    changes to the degree that they have demonstrated on these Cosmos
    flights.â€ He was convinced that â€œthe Soviet Union is testing a large
    rocket engine similar to the one aboard Apollo. Even some of the
    velocity changes made by these Cosmos flights almost exactly match
    the velocity changes of Apollo for such maneuvers as lunar orbital
    insertion and trans-earth injection.â€ All four Cosmos were believed to
    have been launched by Proton, D-type, or SL-4, nonmilitary boosters
    with about half the thrust of Saturn V. Some were said to have trans-
    mitted recordings of human voices as test of radio communications.

September 6-1 6 : Fourth U.N. International Conference on Peaceful Uses
      of Atomic Energy was held in Geneva. US. exhibit included NASA
     demonstration of applying nuclear techniques to ultra-rapid analyses
     of environmental materials and drugs, using satellites and computers.
     Signals from nuclear-powered instruments on moon were relayed to
     Geneva from CSFC via satellite. NASA also displayed lunar samples and
     SNAP-27 and SNAP-19 generators.

     convinced. He felt that responsibility for ensuring safety in use of
     nuclear energy should eventually be transferred from AEC to some
     other agency but move would be â€œprematureâ€ at present.

     by NASA test pilot Thomas C. McMurtry. TF-8A flight test program
     was being accelerated in anticipation of adverse landing conditions
     when lake bed at Edwards, Calif., became wet later in year. Purposes
     of flights were to expand flight envelope to higher dynamic pressures,
     obtain pressure distribution and performance data at higher dynamic
     pressure, evaluate unaugmented stability and control characteristics,
     and investigate buffet boundary for trim flight at design condition of

     â€œ. , . we will be looking far beyond the requirements of the immediate
     mission; we will be seeking answers to questions with a strong im-
     pact on the future of manned space flight during the remainder of
     this century.â€ Major questions as yet unanswered after Gemini and
     Apollo flights were the causes of moderate loss of weight by astro-
     nauts early in flight, moderate cardiovascular deconditioning, mod-
     erate loss of exercise capacity, and minimal loss of bone density.
     Medical results from Gemini and Apollo missions had shown that
     â€œ1. There were no major surprises. 2. As of now, we see no reason
     why man cannot live and woik effeciively in space for a long period

 Najeeb E. Halaby, Pan American World Airways President and Chair-
    man, discussed space shuttle at Symposium of Society of Experimen-
    tal Test Pilots in Los Angeles: â€œNASA has already shown that it appre-
    ciates the contributions airlines can make to the program, by having
    airlines participate with space contractors in the development of the
    space shuttleâ€ to â€œmake the eventual space shuttle work more like a
    standard airliner than a quarterly experiment.â€ Since it took less
    energy to orbit objects than to fly them across U.S., â€œthereâ€™s no
    reason why the cost of Space Shuttle operations should not become
    as low or lower than that of jets.â€ Pan Amâ€™s â€œmost glamorous visionâ€
    was â€œSpace Shuttle as an air transport, carrying passengers from
    New York to Tokyo-or Peking-in 45 minutes, or from Los Angeles
    to Rome in 40.â€˜â€™

    for its intended destination, re-entering the atmosphere without excess

            engineer John C. Arvesen described development of method for
      ARC
   monitoring biological productivity from air by detecting signs of
   chlorophyll. Monitoring device, when tested over California lakes and
   offshore areas, had produced results that conformed closely to readings
   obtained by arduous direct sampling of waters. Ultimate goal was to
   develop satellite-borne system that could monitor global productivity
   of oceans.
       Dr. Charles A. Berry, NASA Director of Life Sciences, said newly
   completed studies of medical data from ApLZo 14 had shown radiation
   exposure to crew that was more than twice that of previous Apollo
   missions. Primary reason for higher exposure was passage of ApUo 18
   spacecraft close to Van Allen radiation belts. Dr. Berry said radiation
   dose was â€œof no hazard or biological significance.â€ Soviet scientists
   said later that cosmonauts carried special antiradiation drug on all
   space flights but had never used it.
       Dr. Berry said Apollo 14 Astronaut Stuart A. Roosa had lost 27%
   of fluid within his body cells during mission. His total body water had
   dropped 18% and red cells in his bloodstream had decreased 9%.
   Losses had been far less for other Apollo 14 astronauts and no such
   dramatic losses had been recorded for Apollo 15 astronauts, indicating
   that individual responses to space varied widely. Heavy loss of
   <C
      exchangeableâ€ potassium had been noted in astronauts during ex-
   tended missions. On Apollo 15, loss had been as great as 15%. Potas-
   sium was deemed exchangeable because it could move readily in and
   out of tissues and thus could be purged from body.

     â€œI am impressed with the soundness of this new space program for the

     our country needs it.â€ Among programâ€™s strengths were: it had con-
     gressional backing ; it was well planned and well balanced to meet basic
     national needs, including national security; it stressed earth orbit as
     (6
        new realm of prime importance and great opportunity, where Amer-
     icaâ€™s capacity for world leadership will be tested not only in this decade
     but in the decades to follow.â€ Program promoted economic progress
     based on new technology, was essential to President Nixonâ€™s peace
     policies based on international cooperation, and was â€œalready part of
     Americaâ€™s destiny, as all of you can testify who watched the Apollo 15
     operations on international television.â€
         NASA had been â€œimpressed and encouragedâ€ by Presidentâ€™s call for
     new programs to ensure maximum enlistment of technology in meeting
     challenge of peace and by Presidentâ€™s promises to present those pro-
     grams in next session of Congress.

September 29-30: NASA's Os0 7 (OSO-H) Orbiting Solar Observatory was
    launched from ETR at 5:45 am EDT by two-stage Thor-Delta DSV-3N
    booster to study sun and its influence on earth's atmosphere. Second-
    stage anomaly resulted in noncircular orbit of 575.7-km (357.7-mi)
     apogee, 329.1-km (204.5-mi) perigee, 93.6-min period, and 33.1'
     inclination. Primary mission objective was to obtain high-resolution
     data from solar corona in particular spectral bands in EUV and in
    visible regions during one solar rotation.
        Tetr 3 (TETR-D) Test and Training Satellite, carried pickaback on
     Delta 2nd stage, was ejected into orbit with 571-km (354.8-mi)
     apogee, 391-km (243-mi) perigee, 94.3-min period, and 33.0' in-
     clination. Primary objective of 45-lb (20.4-kg) secondary payload
     was to test Manned Space Flight Network and train MSFN personnel.
        Second-stage anomaly of launch vehicle separated spacecraft at
     pitch angle outside normal sun acquisition limits. For eight hours
     following orbital insertion, ground controllers manually commanded
     spacecraft to despin. Pitch angle was then changed to place it within
     automatic acquisition range. Sail section was commanded to acqui-
     sition mode and sail acquired and locked onto sun at approximately
     2:OO pin EDT. Batteries were then charged. Orbit would permit ob-
     servations for more than a year.
        Os0 7, improved over earlier OSOS, provided for increase in experi-
     ment size and weight and power and extended capability in pointed
     mode, including stability and pointing during night portion of orbit.
      It was spin-stabilized; weighed 636 kg (1403 lbs) ; carried six sci-
     entific experiments; and had two main sections-wheel (lower) , which
     carried nondirectional scanning experiments and basic support equip-
     ment, and sail (upper), which carried pointed experiments. Experi-
     ments, designed to continue and extend work of preceding oso space-
     craft, were provided by GSFC, NRL, MIT, Univ. of New Hampshire, and
     Univ. of California (San Diego).

      (launched March 7, 1962) and Os0 2 (launched Feb. 3, 1965) had
      passed their six-month lifetimes and together provided more than
     8600 hours of scientific information. OSO-c (launched Aug. 25, 1968)
      had failed to reach orbit when booster malfunctioned. Os0 3
      (launched Mar. 8, 1967) and Oso 4 (launched Oct. 18, 1967) trans-
      mitted on command only. Os0 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1969) had both
      tape recorders and seven of eight experiments operating satisfac-
      torily after six months in orbit. Os0 6 (launched Aug. 9, 1969) was

During September: Dr. James C . Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said in
      interview published by Air Force Magazine that NASA planned to let
      hardware contracts for space shuttle by spring 1972, contingent on
      White House approval. NASA had decided in summer to extend pre-
      liminary design contracts by four months to â€œlook more intensively at
      alternative configurations,â€ examining phased approach for building
       reusable upper stage first and testing and using it with interim
      expendable booster, instead of developing reusable booster at same
       time. Reevaluation of design concepts was stirred by need for addi-
       tional analyses and research and by need to trim expenditures â€œin a
       given year.â€
          NASAâ€™s viewpoint on space in this decade was â€œto bring the pro-
       gram down to earth, both figuratively and literally. We must ask our-

                                     272
sion that the
limated in the conviction that they would be much slower in mastering
intercontinental ballistic missile technology. This conviction, advanced
in the teeth of evidence-after     all, the' Chinese invented the rocket-
was reinforced by reports of widespread technological disruption in
the Cultural Revolution. Their two successful launchings of space
satellites, the last one weighing around 480 pounds [218 kg], in
March 1971, should have disabused even the most skeptical or preju-
diced. In any case, there are a sufficient number of recent eyewitness
accounts by Westerners of Chinese scientific achievements in various
fields to dispell any notions of Chinese technical inferiority." (Bull of

October 1 : Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said strong tech-
    nology base was â€œabsolutely vitalâ€ to US., in speech before 14th
    Annual Aerospace Luncheon of Los Angeles Area Chamber of Com-
    merce. Indications from critics of lack of confidence in advancement
    of â€œgreatest technological evolution in the history of mankindâ€ was
    reminder that â€œwe must do a better job of convincing the man-on-the-
    street of the [space] programâ€™s merits.â€ Public needed information
      to put its priorities in proper perspective.â€ There was â€œsomething
    (6

    seriously wrongâ€ when â€œas a nation we pay people more not to work
    and more in farm subsidies than we do on space research, a program
    which impacts our national economy and vitally affects our national
                 .
    security. . . I am convinced that further erosion of our technological
    leadership will start us on a downhill course from which it will be
    difficult to recover.â€ But, â€in our zeal to forge ahead in technical and
    scientific fields, it is possible to lose sight of the debt we owe to the
    great American public that so steadfastly sustained us during the
    early years.â€ Average American had his priorities. â€œBut he needs to
    be informed il he is to arrive at an intelligent decision about how to
     rank his priorities.â€ Burden of convincing public of necessity for
     â€œcontinuing well-balanced space program for the 1970â€™s and beyondâ€
    lay with those in program.
        Dr. Fletcher also said: â€œWe want cooperation with the Soviets as
    well as with other nations throughout the world. We are ready to do
     our part io get it, but if we have learned the lessons of history, we
    should know that the Soviets will not be eager to cooperate with a
     second-rate power. . . . And that is what we will become if we do not
    proceed with the space shuttle in this decade. We cannot create the
    environment needed for space cooperation, or an era of enduring
     peace, by handing over a monopoly in the realm of orbital flight to
     the Soviet Union or anyone else.â€ (Text)
  Subcommittee on NASA Oversight transmitted report Review of Recent

        Subcommittee concluded that NASAâ€™s        decision not to attempt re-
     covery program for unsuccessful Mariner 8 mission using proof-test
     model â€œseems justifiedâ€ on grounds Mariner 9 (launched May 30)
     had been conceived as backup mission for Mariner 8 from beginning;
     to alter Atlas-Centaur for different project would have been â€œchal-
     lenging;â€ and proof-test model could better be used as Mariner 9
     backup, if necessary, or in 1973 Venus-Mercury and Viking projects.

    of many scientists and engineers for more than a decade in order to

    portions of the magnetic spectrum strikes the Committee as a deci-
     sion of questionable merit.â€ Committee recommended future use of
    prototype spacecraft that could be reengineered and launched as part
     of flight program to extract full value from expensive hardware.
     Manufacturing and quality control procedures in Centaur program
     could be improved. â€œIt is quite clear that a great deal can and should
     be done short of â€˜man-ratingâ€™ Centaur, which would significantly
     improve its reliability.â€ Centaur stage problems â€œseem serious enough
               ..
     to justify . broad scale, independent examination by disinterested
     expertsâ€ so that Centaur, â€œwhich figures so importantly in the space
     program of the next decade, can be utilized with renewed confidence.â€

      but would consider two-stage, fully reusable shuttle, shuttle booster
      with expendable 2nd stage, and launch of RNS as complete unit or

   Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for R&D Grant L. Hansen discussed
      space shuttle at Air Force Assn. meeting in Bethpage, N.Y. NASA and
      USAF work on shuttle engine had been helpful to shuttle program in
      areas of reusability and higher-pressure-engine technology. USAF had
      supported advanced development efforts on liquid-fuel rocket engines
      and had concluded hydrogen and oxygen high-performance-engine
      demonstration program. Work on XLR-129 reusable rocket engine
      had provided basis for shuttleâ€™s reusable high-pressure-rocket concept.
      Residual hardware of USAF XLR-129 program had been turned over
      to NASA for shuttle engine program. Development of shuttle main
      engine was to be conducted at USAFâ€™S Arnold Engineering Develop-
      ment Center. USAF would continue in 1972 to develop technology for
      high-energy orbit-to-orbit stages compatible with a shuttle to accom-
      plish maneuvering missions for late 1970s and early 1980s. (AI; Mug,

* Impact of â€œleftish student movementsâ€ was described in Science by
    Harvard Univ. physicist Dr. Harvey Brooks: â€œToday some believe that
           .
    the . . movements, which are worldwide, form the vanguard of a new
    revolution, the first true revolution in advanced industrial societies.
    If so, it will be the first in modern history which had not attempted
    to ally itself with science. So far as its ideology is discernible at all,
    it seems to be antiscientific and antirational, more akin to the early
    Christians than to the modern Marxists, despite the Marxist slogans.â€

October 1-5: Fourth International Symposium on Basic Environmental
    Problems of Man in Space was held jointly in Yerevan, U S S R . , by
    rAA and Soviet Academy of Sciences. Papers dealt with medical problems
    of prolonged space missions, studies of mechanism underlying single

    influences, and bioastronautical contributions to general medical science
    and practice. Symposium reviewed results of Soyuz 11-Salyut 1 mission,

    dish oscillating at rate of once every second, New York Times reported.
    OsciIIations endangered antennaâ€™s structure and made observations
    â€œvirtually impossible.â€ Antenna, at Effelsberg, West Germany, had been
    cited by astronomers as demonstration of why massive and costly radio
    astronomy engineering enterprises should be under professional manage-

October 3-6: Os0 7, launched Sept. 29, made the first x-ray observations
    from spacecraft of beginning solar flare and solar â€œstreamersâ€ (long,
    tapered structures observed in solar corona). Observations would lead
    to new understanding of flares not possible before. Flares had many
    effects on earthâ€™s environment, weather, and communications. Streamers
    had been photographed before only during solar eclipses and occa-
    sionally by short sounding rocket flights. Os0 7 experiment created own
    G L eclipseâ€ by using occulting disc.

    wheeled vehicle stopped transmitting photos and soil analyses to earth
    when its isotope heat reserves were exhausted during its 11th lunar
    night on moon. Depletion of nuclear heat source had caused tempera-
    tures on rover to drop during lunar night. Vehicle had been landed
    on moon in Sea of Rains by Luna 17 Nov. 17, 1970.
       Solar-powered Lunokhod 1 had successfully conducted scientific
    and technical research program with all systems functioning normally.

         Flight of orbital station, lasting about six months, had consisted of
      two phases. First was stationâ€™s joint flight with Soyuz 10 spacecraft
       (launched April 23), piloted by Cosmonauts Vladimir A. Shatalov,
      Aleksey S. Yeliseyev, and Nikolay N. Rukavishnikov. Soyuz 10 linked
      up with Sdyut 1 for Sl/, hours, undocked, and reentered April 25.
         Second phase began June 6 with orbiting of Soyuz 11, carrying
      Cosmonauts Georgy T. Dobrovolsky, Vladislav N. Volkov, and Viktor I.
      Patsayev. Spacecraft docked with station June 7 and Soym 1 three-   1
      man crew transferred to Salyut 1 for 23-day stay. While on board, crew
      carried out comprehensive scientific and technical studies and experi-
      ments. Upon return June 30 after record-breaking near-m days in space,
      three cosmonauts were found dead in spacecraft. Soviet authorities said
      deaths were caused by sudden loss of pressure in Soyuz capsule.
         Salyut 1 remained in orbit until Oct. 11, when braking engine was
      switched on to decelerate spacecraft ; station began descending trajec-
      tory and entered atmosphere. Lost with Salyut 1 were films, tapes,
      biological samples, and scientific experiments left on board by Soyuz 10
      cosmonauts. During entire lifetime, orbital stationâ€™s onboard equipment
      operated normally. Since spacecraft was not recoverable and might fall
      on populated area if left to deorbit naturally, it had to be destroyed.

       research and space medicine largely because U.S. had â€œopted for an

    gestion by Post Sept. 29 that $800 million in funds for F-14 be elimi-
    nated from military budget: â€˜9n conjunction with the full spectrum
    of conventional naval weapons and sensors, the design capabilities of
    the F-14 are credible and responsible to the perceived threat for the
    decade ahead. As in the case of the F 4 , which has now reached the
    end of its growth potential against a constantly upgraded Soviet tech-
    nology, the F-14 is conceived as an aircraft to be used for more than
    a decade into the future-it, too, will be capable of substantial per-
    formance improvement as the threat changes and as technology is
    advanced.â€

    there is a school of thought which holds that the heavily and expen-
    sively defended [aircraft] carrier can be rendered inoperable by
    comparatively simple Soviet weapons and thus is inadequate to the

October 15: March 7 discovery of water vapor on moon by two suprather-
    mal ion detectors left on lunar surface by Apollo 12 and 14 astronauts

    Dr. H. Kent Hills. Water bursts had been found 14 min apart at two
    lunar sites just after seismometers at sites had picked up swarm of
    moonquakes. Dr. Freeman said in Houston, â€œI think this proves that
    the moon is still actively quaking and venting gas and also indicates
    there is a good possibility of liquid water somewhere on the moon.â€

* Eyewitness to Space by H. Lester Cooke with James H. Dean, published

     drawings by artists in NASA artist program. â€œWhat they have created
     is an extraordinary record . . . because it records more than the eye,
     even the trained eye, can see. The sketches and many of the paintings
     do indeed record what any eye can see, but the seeing is special.
     Beyond that, artist after artist at some point found himself pushed
     by the material itself into taking an abstract, symbolic view of the
     space flights themselves, painting a vision, not a view.â€ NASA artists
     program, â€œone of the most remarkable ventures in art-government
      relations,â€ had brought hundreds of artists to NASA facilities to
      paint or draw what they saw and they were to see whatever they
      wanted and depict it in whatever manner suited their perceptions.â€
      Only requirement was that all work was to be turned over to NASA,
     which had given it to National Gallery. Coauthor Cooke was National
     Gallery Curator of Painting. It was â€œhard to think of anything in
      art history that quite compares with the NASA program.â€ Getlein re-
      called Italian TV coverage of first moon walk. â€œOne big response to
     the event was to convene gatherings of famous Italians-non-scientists

      all-in studios . . and have them talk about the moon. But at many
      points in the protracted coverage, against a background of Beetho-
      ven, a beautiful Tuscan voice read Dante.â€ Qualities evoked by this
      â€œodd response, but an oddly perfect one,â€ were â€œprecisely those that
      have eluded American television coverage of the space program. They
      are qualities that this book reaches for constantly and often attains.â€

    had named misjudgment in estimating altitude as primary cause,
    NASA announced. Mitigating factors were lack of familiar objects on
    Indian River surface to help pilot judge altitude, possible visual
    focusing on false water surface because of waterâ€™s smoothness, change
     in sun reflection on water caused by change in course, and possi-
    bility that Cernanâ€™s experience with high-speed aircraft might have
    contributed to altitude misjudgment in slower craft. Board said Cer-

October 18-21: Lunar Science Institute held conference on lunar geo-
    physics at MSC. Scientists said new evidence from Apollo 15 heat
    flow experiment indicated moon was hotter than expected and might
    account for melting temperatures within moon and volcanic activity
    on lunar surface. Thermometers placed in two holes near Hadley Rille
    had shown that amount of heat from moon was one half that of heat
    measured from earth. Since moon was one fourth earthâ€™s size, relative
    abundance of radioactive isotopes which generated heat within planet
    might be greater in moon than in earth. Lunar scientists also were
     puzzled by area across Sea of Rains and Ocean of Storms several
    times more radioactive than rest of moon. Dr. James R. Arnold of
    Univ. of California at San Diego said, â€œIt is not obvious why a whole
     geographic area on the moon would be different.â€
        Dr. John W. Freeman, Jr., of Rice Univ. referred to results of
    Apollo 12 and 14 suprathermal ion detector experiments that had
     discovered water vapor on moon [see Oct. 151. Dr. Gary V. Latham,
    Apollo program chief seismic investigator, said neither he nor Dr.
     Freeman could locate source of tiny moonquakes that released gas
     from beneath lunar surface, including water vapor seen March 7.
     Dr. Latham described sudden and large surge from lunar surface
     detected by seismometer in April during series of moonquake swarms.
     Though he knew of no volcano on moon, he compared event-largest
     moonquake yet recorded-to volcanic activity on earth. (MSC Release

     tinuation of the program not only desirable but mandatory, since
     we are so close to a flyable engine.â€ As senior member of Senate
     Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Sen. Cannon was
     â€œgreatly disturbed that the space program in recent years has been
     progressively cut back.â€ If US. space program was to continue â€œthe

     NERVA funding issue is terribly important. . . if we are to cast aside
     our earlier desire to go forward in space and subject our investment
     to a less-than-starvation funding level, we are only deceiving our-
     selves. I believe that rather than merely giving lip service to space,
     we ought to consider a total restructuring or delegation of NASAâ€™s   role

    consistent systems could be constructed ; each seemingly logical.
    â€œPtolemy placed the earth at the center of the universe, Copernius the

    himself never dared to give preference to his own. The only way to
    decide between the two is to see where they lead. An astronaut basing
    his calculation on Ptolemy would end in the nowhere. Our present
    political system leads to poverty, inflation, unemployment, crime, drugs,
    war and the neglect of our priorities toward a final catastrophe. The

    vehicle for space shuttle transportation system, Aviation Week & Space
    Technology reported. ( A v Wk, 10/25/71,12)
* Decisions on NASAâ€™S space shuttle program might be politically timed,
    Aviation Week & Space Technology said. Four contractors would com-
    plete study contracts in spring 1972. â€œAt this point, President Nixon-
    in the midst of his re-election campaign-might         publicly state his
    support for the project.â€ Selection of winners â€œof the biggest plum in
    spaceâ€ would not be announced until after the November election,
    magazine said. ( A v Wk, 10/25/71,11)

    satellite program had been delayed from Nov. 3 to early December
    because Office of Management and Budget could not complete review
    of proposed program in time, Aviation Week & Space Technology
    reported. Final pre-bid briefings for prospective contractors also had
    been delayed. ( A v Wk, 10/25/71,23)
  French national space agency Centre National #Etudes Spatiales ( CNES)
    budget request for 1972 would be approximately $150 million, up
    from $132.7 million received for 1971, Aviation Week & Space Tech-
    noZogy reported. Budget would be augmented to cover participation in
    ELDO Europa 3 launch vehicle program if production of advanced
    launch vehicle was approved. Increase in CNES funding would be
    largely offset by inflation, French officials had said. ( A v Wk, 10/25/

  Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial noted â€œmajor surprisesâ€
     from first four manned lunar explorations: Possibility of existence of
     water or ice below lunar surface; detection of heat near moonâ€™s core
     and of seismic activity on moon; greater magnetic field than expected;
     and fact moon was â€œmineral storehouse of tremendous magnitude with
    some elements in combinations rarely or never found on earth.â€ There
    was also â€œsizable accumulation of other scientific data to be refined
    from the instrumentation still functioning on the moon and the nearly
    400 Ib [181 kg] of lunar rocks and soil samples. . . . The moon has
    proved to be a scientific bonanza regardless of what more material
    benefits may be realized eventualiy. All of this must be a cause for
    considerable chagrin and embarrassment to that segment of the scien-
    tific community that led the sneering section during the early stages
    of the Apollo program when flight testing of operational hardware was
     of necessity its primary concern.â€ (Hotz, Av Wk, 10/25/71, 7 )
  Mikhail K. Yangel, Soviet scientist and rocket expert, died of heart

October 25-30: Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Leonid I.
     Brezhnev paid state visit to France as guest of French President
    Georges Pompidou. Later Tass reported that they had discussed
    Soviet-French cooperation in science and technology: â€œThey noted
    with satisfaction the successes achieved in this field since the time of
    signing the agreement of June 30, 1966, and expressed their apprecia-
    tion, in particular, of the results of the sixth session of the Mixed
    Soviet-French Standing Commission held in Moscow from July 22 to 24,
     1971. In this connection the sides referred to the important achieve-
    ments in cooperation in the fields of space exploration, peaceful uses
    of atomic energy, as well as high energy physics, in particular the
    installation of a French laser reflector on the moon surface, the com-
    missioning of the French bubble chamber Mirabelle at the Soviet
    proton accelerator in Serpukhov, the Soviet-French contact on enrich-
    ing French natural uranium in the Soviet Union.â€ (FBIS-SOV-71-210,

October 26: Identification of molecule magnesium tetrabenzporphine in
    outer space as forerunner of chlorophyll by Dr. Fred M. Johnson,
    California State College spectroscopist, was reported in Wushington
    Post. Dr. Johnson had analyzed spectral lines taken of Milky Way
    from Lick Observatory optical telescope during 18-yr effort to identify
    nitrogen-bearing hydrocarbons among hydrogen clouds in interstellar
    space. He had succeeded after analyzing spectral line surrounding hot,
    young star in Orion constellation. Finding, Dr. Johnson believed,
    might provide clue to building blocks of life in universe. â€œWhatever
    mechanism occurs here occurs throughout the universe and you can
    be sure it occurs in the solar system.â€ (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 10/26/71, A3)
* NAS held meeting on molecular constitutions of interstellar space.
       Dr. William J. Welch, Univ. of California at Berkeley astronomer,
    said 23 different molecules had been detected in interstellar space.
    Dr. Arno A. Penzias of Bell Telephone Laboratories said new radio-
    telescope at Kitt Peak, Ariz., had detected amount of carbon monoxide
    that â€œcovers vast regions of space.â€ Detected carbon seemed â€œto play
    a disproportionately large role.â€ Dr. Benjamin M. Zuckerman of Univ.
    of Maryland said it might be possible that carbon monoxide was
    formed in shells around very young and very old stars from which it
    was ejected into space. (Lyons, NYT, 10/27/71, 51)

    neering, and team of DOD scientists testified before congressional Joint
    Committee on Atomic Energy during hearings to determine whether
    treaty could safely be negotiated to ban underground tests without
    inspection. Dr. Foster and Dr. Stephen J. Lukasic, Director of DOD
    Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) , said that, while advances
    had been made in detecting underground tests, it was still impossible
    to spot some detonations of up to 100 kt. (Lyons, NYT, 10/28/71, 1 )
* Authorization by President Nixon of underground test of five-megaton
    nuclear warhead on Amchitka Island in Aleutians was announced by

* Technique for accurately forecasting occurrence and location of solar
    flares by inferring solar magnetic fields from hydrogen light photos
    taken by earth-based optical telescopes was announced by NOAA. Tech-
    nique, developed by NOAA scientist Patrick S. McIntosh, was alternative
    to use of magnetographs for determining solar magnetic-field data. It
    had enabled NOAAâ€™S Space Environment Laboratory at Boulder, Colo., to
    forecast region of sun where solar flares would occur, correctly 85% of
    time for all flares and 95% of time for major flares. NASA had con-
    tracted with NOAA to refine its solar forecasting capabilities in prepara-
    tion for operating solar telescopes aboard Skylab beginning in spring

    help solve domestic problems, establish R&D priorities accordingly, and
    provide incentives for industry to pursue technological goals. Times
    said program could be major step toward making Government partner
    for first time in industries outside aerospace and defense, result in

  USAF commanders believed USAF had entered â€œcritical period in which
    American strategic and tactical air power is decliningâ€ while U.S.S.R.â€™s

    were that USAFâ€™S basic weapon systems, B-52 bomber and F 4 fighter-
    bomber, were nearing obsolescence and needed to be replaced at â€œhigh
    costâ€ by J3-1 and F-15 ;satellite-gathered intelligence indicated U.S.S.R.
    had established lead over US. in land-based ICBMS, was building
    emplacements for larger missiles, and had deployed FOBS to bring
    missiles on target from any direction; and developments were taking
    place against â€œbackground of budgetary stringencyâ€ in US. (Middleton,

    improved Defense Satellite Communications System satellites from ETR
    at 10:09 pm EST into transfer orbits and then into separate, synchronous
    orbits over Pacific. Orbital parameters for both spacecraft: 35 816.0-km

    diameter had emerged several billion years ago, while small craters
    up to 10 m (32.8 ft) in diameter were millions of years younger. Study
    of lunar terrain showed many layers. Outer layer, from 0.2 to 0.5 mm

        opportunity to apply technology directly to the solution of an environ-
     mental problem of increasing public concern.â€ It was not enough
     â€œto think in terms of more power, more lift, more speed. If we wish
     the taxpayer to continue to support civil aviation, we should take as
    our motto, â€˜Fly Quiet!â€â€™ NASA could be proud of progress made in
     reducing aircraft noise. NASA was â€œwell preparedâ€ to develop super-
    sonic technology that would â€œpermit supersonic flights over continents
     as well as oceans without harmful sonic boom effects and outstrip the
     current foreign models in speed, capacity, range, and profitability.â€
         Dr. Fletcher described NASA STOL aircraft program as â€œfirst research
     program of this magnitude focused on the needs of civil rather than
     military aviation.â€ He felt US. should establish â€œclear national policy
        .

November 10-II: Mariner 9 (launched by NASA May 30) began taking
    preorbit science photos of Mars, showing planet as featureless, half-
    moon-like object, hazy and dust-covered. First photos, taken over 2 4 h r
    period from distances of 860 000 to 570 000 km (535 000 to 355 000
    mi) from Mars, were transmitted to Goldstone tracking station and
    then to JPL Nov. 11. They were not as clear as photos taken by
    Mariner 6 and 7 in 1969. Astronomers reported dust storm of â€œun-
    precedentedâ€ duration and scope ranging over much of planet, ob-
    scuring nearly all surface details. Dr. William H. Pickering, JPL
    Director, said storm could be regarded as a â€œpremium,â€ since oppor-
    tunity to see dynamic, unusual event on another planet was rare. But
    protracted period of bad weather over Mars could jeopardize mapping
    of surface, Dr. Bradford A. Smith of New Mexico State Univ. said
    storm appeared to have reached its peak about Oct. 21 and there had
    been â€œa positive but very, very slow clearing of the dust. . . . Weâ€™re
    quite clearly seeing the south polar cap.â€ Polar cap, he said, was not as
    bright as expected, indicating dust had not cleared away completely
    in that region. Scientists believed they were able to see Deimos, tiny
     outer moon of Mars. Photos, made in three sequences at intervals,
     provided complete coverage of planet as it rotated about its axis.
     First two sequences each covered one Martian day; third covered
     about one third of day. Radio signals had reached Goldstone, Calif.,
     tracking station, were relayed to JPL, and were fed into computers
    that had converted signals to TV images. Mariner 9 was scheduled
     to enter Mars orbit Nov. 13. (NASA Proj Off; Wilford, NYT, 11/11-

      solar system. Orbital parameters were close to planned ones: 1398-km
       (868.7-mi) periapsis altitude, 12-hr 34-min period, and 64.5O inclina-
      tion. Spacecraft propulsion system and attitude control systems per-
      formed flawlessly after 400-million-km (248-million-mi ) journey.
      Mariner 9 would orbit Mars twice daily while photographing up to
      70% of Martian surface in next three months.

November 13-15: Mariner 9 became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet Mars.
The first photos of the planet were obscured by a dust storm but later pictures
revealed sinuous rilles whose origin was puzzling. The valley above, 700 kilometers
 (435 miles) long, was photographed Jan. 22, 1972, in the Mars Rasena region.
Such rilles might have been produced by collapse of the roof over subsurface lava
flows. They raised the possibility of erosion by water in ancient Martian history.

November 13-15: Inserted into orbit
around Mars Nov. 13, Mariner 9
took man's first closeup photos of
the Martian moon Phobos Nov. 29
and 30. The computer-enhanced photo
at the right was taken 5543 kilo-
meters (3444 miles) from Phobos
Nov. 30. The profusion of craters
suggested that the moon is very old
and possesses considerable structural
strength. The Martian volcanic moun-
tain Nix Olympica (below) was
photographed in late January 1972
as the planefs dust storm subsided.
 The mountain was 500 kilometers
 (310 miles) across at the base, more
than twice as broad as the most mas-
sive volcanic pile on the earth. Steep
cliffs fell from the mountain flanks
to a great plain. The complex muL
tiple volcanic vent at the summit was
65 kilometers (40miles) in diameter.

       First photos were obscured by dust storm but before end of month
   Mariner 9 had shown that Mars bulged at equator, was â€œrougher gravi-
   tationallyâ€ than expected, and probably had wide variety of rock
   compositions; instruments had detected small amounts of water vapor
   at south pole and warmer air pockets above pole [see Nov. 16-23].
   Spacecraft also made manâ€™s first close photo of potato-shaped Martian
   moon Deimos [see Nov. 26-27] and photos of moon Phobos [see
   NOV.29-30].
       First Mariner photos from orbit were broadcast live by national TV
   network, but detail was limited by dust storms that had raged on sur-
   face since September. Dr. Robert H. Steinbacher, JPL project scien-
   tist, said â€œWeâ€™re hopeful that as the storm dies down we can get some
    good pictures of the dust settling to the surface. This is an unprece-
   dented chance to watch changes in the Martian weather.â€ He said that
   if cameras worked properly pictures would be 1000 times better than
   any earthbound telescopes had taken.
       On Nov. 14 spacecraft transmitted three sequences of TV pictures. Of
   more than 60 photos returned, only seven revealed surface features.
    Dust storm continued and atmospheric experts could see no sign of
    abatement. Dust obscuring planet was apparently very fine sand
    which high winds pushed to height of as much as 16 km (10 mi)
   above surface.
       On fourth orbit spacecraft successfully completed orbit trim ma-
   neuver at 9:44 pm EST Nov. 15. Maneuver changed orbital period of
   spacecraft to make it synchronous with Mars viewing period of Deep
    Space Station antenna at Goldstone, Calif. New orbital parameters
    were 1394-km (866.2-mi) periapsis altitude, 11-hr 57-min 12-sec
   period, and 64.34O inclination.
       Data from remote-sensing instruments confirmed earlier observa-
    tions that carbon dioxide was major constituent of Martian atmos-
    phere and also suggested possibility of â€œhot spotsâ€ on planet. Dr.
    Ellis D. Miner of JPL said sensor detected .average temperature rise
    of 6.7 K (12â€™F) in area 24 km (15 mi) square below Mars equator.
    Temperature rise might indicate hole in cloud cover exposing moun-
    tain peak or plateau reflecting residual heat or evidence of internal
    source of heat on Mars. uv spectrometer data indicated dust storm
    was made up of fairly coarse-grained, sandlike particles. (NASA Proj

November 15-29: Explorer 45 (SSS-A)         Small Scientific Satellite was SUC-
     cessfully launched for NASA by Italian crew at 8:52 am local time
     (12:52 am EST) from San Marco launch platform off coast of Kenya.
     Four-stage Scout launch vehicle boosted 50-kg (110-lb) satellite into
     orbit with 27 034.5-km (16 798.5-mi) apogee, 220.8-km (137.2-mi)
  . perigee, 469-min period, and 3.57O inclination. Primary objective was
     to measure characteristics and formation of earthâ€˜s ring current and
     development of main-phase magnetic storms ; relation between mag-
     netic storms, aurora, and acceleration of particles within inner m a g
     netosphere ; and relative importance oâ‚¬ various diffusion mechanisms
     in populating radiation zones at 4- to 5-earth-radii elliptical equa-
     torial orbit.
         By Nov. 29 all satellite household â‚¬unctions were nominal but
     spacecraft was coning at higher angle than planned, which would
     make data reduction slightly more difficult. Attempts were being made
     to reduce coning angle. Five experiments had been turned on and
     were operating satisfactorily. One experiment, charged particle de-
     tector, remained to be turned on.
         Explorer 45, 26-sided polyhedral spacecraft 63.5 cm (25 in) in
     diameter, attained length of 5.8 m (19 ft) with booms deployed. It
      was second US. satellite to be launched by Italy under April 30, 1969,

November 16-23: Photos from Mariner 9 (launched May 30) showed dust
    storm on Mars appeared to have subsided somewhat over south pole
    area Nov. 16, and by Nov. 19 photos showed dust settling to surface
    in a t least two regions of planet. Scientists believed winds might have
    died down in these areas.
        Mariner scientists reported in news conference at JPL Nov. 19 that
    instruments had shown planet was flattened at poles and bulging at
    equator and had more irregularities in its gravitational field than
    moon had. Bulge was discovered in area called Tharsis, on equator,
    making planetâ€™s diameter 39 km (24 mi) greater at equator than
    through poles. Infrared spectrometer had measured reflected radiations
    that suggested wide range of rock compositions on Mars surface, vary-
    ing from high in silicon and oxygen to low. Spectrometer had also
     detected small amounts of water vapor at south pole, as had been
     observed on previous Mariner flights.
        On Nov. 23 Mariner 9â€™s infrared interferometer spectrometer (IRIS)
     detected pocket of warm air above south polar cap in same region as
     water vapor traces had been found earlier. Air pocket was about
     240 K (-30Â°C). (Wilford, NYT, 11/20/71, 51; Oâ€™Toole, W Post,

November 16: NASA notified U.S.S.R. of Mariner 9 Mars orbit in telexed
     message to I. A. Zhulin, Soviet space expert, in Moscow. Message,
     from Dan Schneiderman, Mariner 9 Project Manager at JPL, said
     spacecraft had achieved desired orbit but ephemeris used in planning
     orbit required 60-km (37-mi) adjustment. Mars â€œappears brighter than
     expected by a factor of two. Surface features are almost entirely
     obscured, but the south polar cap can be seen because of its brightness.
     This is believed to be the result of a dust storm which covers the entire
     planet.â€ Infrared instruments on the two Mariner 9 cameras â€œappear
     to be seeing the [Martian] surface, but interpretation of their results
     is complicated by effects of the dust storm.
        Message invited Soviet request for additional orbit information and
     described Nov. 10 and 1 photos taken by Mariner 9 before Mars
                                  1
     arrival. Photos had shown â€œfour distinct dark features,â€ one â€œpossibly
     Nix Olympica.â€ Nov. 12 photos had shown streaks 1000 km (620 mi)
     long originating at fourth spot. â€œChanges in appearance of these four
     dark areas over the coming weeks may provide unique information
     about the dust storm.â€ (NASA Release 71-229)

November 18: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said in speech
    before National Space Club that Apollo program would end with
    Apollo 16 and 17 launches in 1972. Later, responding to question
    concerning possible cancellation of Apollo 17 because of FY 1973
    budget restraints, Dr. Fletcher said, â€œThe fate of Apollo 17 is beyond
    my control at the present time.â€
       NASA was shifting emphasis, Dr. Fletcher said in speech: â€œWhen
    Apollo ends, most of our space activities planned for this decade will
    be in Earth orbit-and       Moon exploration, for a time, will be left
    completely to the Soviets.â€ Continuing effort to explore planets also
    was related to earth studies. â€œI am sure that much of what we learn
    will have direct and valuable application to our understanding of
    Earth and our current concern with environmental protection.â€ Apollo
    photos of earth had helped create concern for worldâ€™s environment.
    â€œI am glad to say that NASA is now well prepared to take a leading role
    in defining and responding to this concern.â€ Apollo technology and
    equipment would be used directly in Skylab and directly or indirectly
    in space shuttle, Dr. Fletcher said. â€œMoreover, we gained invaluable
    experience in Earth orbital operations in the Gemini program and on
    the way to the Moon and back. We are well prepared for the next
    logical steps in near-Earth space. I wish very much we could continue
                       ...
    lunar exploration        but if we have to make hard choices in this
    decade, then the right choice is to return to Earth orbit and defer
    lunar exploration.â€
       NASA hoped to keep open option of additional Apollo missions in
    earth orbit. â€œThis would enable us to carry out additional experiments
    in our Earth resources program, and would also facilitate our planning
    for cooperative flights with the Soviet Union.â€
       Worldwide demand for applications satellites could be met only by

      been obtained on performance of Spartan warhead. Analyses of radio-
      active melt, expected to be completed by spring 1972, were required
      to evaluate warhead performance fully. There had been â€œno detectable
      release of radioactivity to the marine or surface environment.â€ Meas-
      urements would â€œcontinue for a number of years.â€ No large earth-
      quake had been triggered although â€œhundreds of after-shocksâ€ had
      been registered in vicinity until collapse of cavity created by detona-
      tion. Ground motion had been felt â€œstrongly on Amchitka, distinctly
      at kdak, nearly 200 miles [320 km] away, and less distinctly at
      Shemya, somewhat farther away.â€ No large ocean wave from ocean
      floor movement had been recorded. Observed effects on living species

     lution of Mars Nov. 26. Mariner 9 was 10 300 km (6400mi) from
     Mars and 8500 km (5300 mi) from Deimos when photo was taken.
     Picture told scientists that Deimos was almost 12.9 km (8 mi) in
     diameter and was shaped more like potato than grapefruit. Dr. Carl
     Sagan, director of Cornel1 Universityâ€™s Laboratory for Planetary
     Studies, cautioned against speculation on moonâ€™s makeup, but said
     â€œwhatever its origins the Mariner mission represents a wonderful
     opportunity to study it.â€ Deimos was discovered along with other
     Martian moon Phobos in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall,
     who named moons after two sons of Greek mythological god Ares-
     Mars in Roman mythology-as given by Homer in Iliad.
        On Nov. 27 Mariner 9 failed in attempt at closeup photograph of
     Martian moon Phobos. JPL ground controllers said spacecraftâ€™s cam-
     era wasnâ€™t pointed correctly when attempt was made. Orbit of Phobos
     was not known precisely enough to ensure getting photo. Successful
     photo of Phobos would have shown greater detail than recent picture
      of Deimos, Marsâ€™ other moon, since Phobos was twice as large as
      Deimos and spacecraft passed 1600 km (100 mi) closer. Mariner 9
     had photographed Phobos Nov. 13 from 150 000 km (93 000 mi) out.

November 27: U.S.S.R.â€™s Mars 2 probe (launched May 19) ejected cap-
    sule 1380 km (858 mi) above Mars on direct trajectory to planetâ€™s
    surface. Capsule, carrying pennant bearing U.S.S.R. hammer-and-
    sickle coat of arms, became first man-made object to reach surface.
    After capsule ejection Mars 2 decelerated and entered Martian orbit
    with 25 000-km (15500-mi) apogee, 1380-km (858-mi) perigee,
    1080-min (18-hr) period, and 48.9O inclination.
       Mars 2 had traveled 470 million km (292 million mi) to reach Mars.

  Article by Paul Dickson in The Progressive discussed â€œEmpire of Think
     Tanks.â€ R&D in U S . had become â€œvast, powerful, and well financed
     empire . . . replete with its own priorities, powers, and pecking order.
     Atop this empire is a diverse group of institutions called think tanks,
     which as agents of applied research and policy study have a fateful
     impact on the nation. The most famous of these . . . is the RAND
     Corporation . . . a prime mover in military research.â€
        R&D was â€œparticularly critical element in the battle over national
     priorities because it not only reflects our current priorities but largely
     determines what will be technologically feasible in the future.â€™â€™ Lunar
     landings had shown â€œhow much is possible if a great deal of thought,
     resources, and dedication are channeled into any stated goal. The vast
     majority of Project Apollo money had been pumped into space R&D
     during the decade prior to the first landing. There is, however, a catch
     in invoking the APO~~O/NASA    example, because such a new knowledge
     as is developed in such a program must be applied and directed in
     order to get anywhere. If not conscientiously applied, well-performed
     research can lead to a range of ends from a simple nonuse to a more
     insidious ruse-a way of dodging action under the guise of studying
    the problem.â€
        Independent think tanks needed to be scrutinized along with Feder-
     ally sponsored ones. â€œMany of them receive the bulk of their funds
     from the Government, and, though not officially â€˜sponsoredâ€™ like RAND,
     they bring up the same questions of power, unchecked and unanswer-
     able, evoked by the officially sponsored outfits.â€ (CR, 11/3/71,

    Martian craters.
       Dr. Bradford A. Smith of New Mexico State Univ. said storm had
    begun 10 wks earlier, had reached peak of intensity in 5th wk, and
    was gradually but continuously clearing. Project scientists disagreed,
    however, how long dust would obscure Mars; predictions ranged from
    a few weeks to months. If storm continued throughout mission, primary
    objective might have to be changed. Dr. Smith explained prime objec-
    tive â€œwas to map 70 percent of the planet in high resolution. If the
    storm does not clear up immediately, it will not be possible to do that
    within the nominal mission. An alternative might be to focus on the
    phenomenon that we have on our hands; that is, the dust storm. And
    instead of studying it in bits and pieces and waiting for the planet to
    clear up . . . to rearrange our sequences to make an all out study of
    this atmospheric phenomenon.â€ Failure to complete mapping as planned
    would not significantly affect Viking Mars landing mission because,
    with only slight degradation, Viking zone could be mapped in last half
    or last third of Mariner 9 mission. â€˜â€˜Also Viking has the capability to
    keep its landers in orbit for as long as two months while it does the
    mapping . . . [and] the capability to do some photographic site selec-
    tion even if there were no usable pictures returned from â€™71.â€
       Dr. Harold Masursky of US. Geological Survey described four high
    points on Mars, all with large summit craters, suggesting that they
    might be volcanic calderas. Great alignment of relatively young topo-
    graphic highs with summit craters suggested that Mars was geochemi-

     cally active-that in not too distant past there had been extensive vol-
    canic activity. Similar features might be found at lower elevations;
    they would be of interest because they had been, and still might be,
    hot. Such volcanic sources had, according to most opinions, produced
     terrestrial atmosphere ; that is, carbon dioxide and water had come
     from such volcanic vents. Dr. Masursky emphasized that volcanic
     theory was not agreed on; project scientistsâ€™ views ranged from
                                                    .â€

        Data on Mars moons Deimos and Phobos were described by Dr.
    James B. Pollack of ARC. Deimos was 12 by 13y2 km (7% by Sy2 mi)
     and Phobos was 21 by 26 km (13 by 16 mi). Moons were â€˜(among the
     darkest objects in the solar system,â€ reflecting only about 5% of sun-
     light that fell on them. Moonsâ€™ darkness could be attributed to basalts
    or carbonaceous chondrites in soil. If scientists could determine reason
     for darkness, they would soon be able to determine whether moons
     were captured asteroids or remnants of material from which Mars was
     formed. (Transcript)

  Remaining â€œpuzzlesâ€ of solar system pattern were discussed by Walter
    Sullivan in New York Times article: General assumption was that
    sun, planets, and moons had been formed from â€œswirling, flattened
    cloud of material.â€ But: â€œWhy does Mars have two tiny moons, each
    only a few miles in diameter, yet our moon is a quarter the diameter
     of the earth? Why do some of the outer moons of Jupiter go the
    â€˜wrong wayâ€™-counter       clockwise-around that huge planet? Why is
    the earthâ€˜s moon formed of a different mix of elements from that con-
     stituting the earth?â€ Recent information had â€œilluminated these
    questions though it had not resolved them.â€ Earthâ€™s moon was giving
     off â€œfar more heat than had been predicted on the basis of assump-
    tions of how it was formed.â€™â€™ Mariner 9 photos of the two Mars moons
     had shown both to be irregular chunks â€œrather than systematically
     spherical bodies in the manner normally attributed to moons and
     planets.â€ George Washington Univ. scientist J. Martyn Bailey had
    proposed that all seven of Jupiterâ€™s outer moons were asteroids cap-
    tured by that planetâ€™s powerful gravity and that Jupiterâ€™s clockwise
    moons had been captured when planet was farthest from sun, while
     counter-clockwise moons had been captured when Jupiter was nearest
     sun. Lunar Science Institute scientists had agreed there had been
     sufficient sorting and layering on earthâ€˜s moon to produce radioactive
     crust that could account for heat flow. Information on two Martian
     moons had indicated that Phobos and Deimos looked much like
     asteroidal fragments but that did not prove that they were captured
     asteroids. They could have been formed as spherical moons from
     material left when Mars was being created and later â€œbattered into
     their irregular shapes.â€ (NYT, 12/5/71, 4:s)

  RAND Corp. specialists Robert L. Perry and Arthur J. Alexander testified
    before Senate Committee on Armed Services that France, Sweden,
    U.K., and U.S.S.R. had been turning out excellent fighter aircraft for
    fraction of what U.S. paid in money and manpower. Cost difference
    was largely due to simpler design, strict â€œfly before you buyâ€ policy,
    and reliance on small teams of experts rather than on huge number
    of men and machines. Perry said government 05ces monitoring devel-
    opment of new aircraft in France, Sweden, and U.K. rarely contained
    more than 30 specialists. In US., figure was normally five times that.
    Within European countries developing aircraft, skilled workers com-
    mitted to program rarely exceeded 700. In U.S. â€œfrom two to ten
    times as many comparable specialists are employed,â€ Perry said.

     Mars 3 has reported by signal. And even if neither of these latest raids
     on the unknown returns as much information as men want, they have

  Team of ARC astronomers headed by Dr. Charles P. Sonett had found
     evidence that sunâ€™s spin rate 4.6 billion yrs ago was one revolution
     every three hours rather than current one rotation every 27 days,
     ARC announced. Study of melting histories of meteorites recovered on
     earth and observations of young stars in constellation Taurus led
     astronomers to believe high rotation rate and other mechanisms typi-
     cal of newly formed suns had forced flow of electric gases from sun,
     causing sun to lose one third of its original mass in a few million
     years and stripping away primordial atmosphere of Mercury, earth,
     and Mars. Complete melting could have occurred in asteroids. Radio-
     active dating had established that many meteorites were melted about
     4.6 billion yrs ago. ARC astronomers believed inertia of gas molecules
     thrown out by sun and tied to sun by solar magnetic field, with inter-
     planetary magnetic field itself, would have slowed sunâ€™s rotation over
     4.6 billion yrs. (ARC Release 71-71)

December 19-20: Intelsat-IV F-3 comsat was launched by NASA for Com-
    SatCorp on behalf of INTELSAT. Satellite, launched from ETR at 8 : l O
    pm EST by Atlas-Centaur booster, entered elliptical transfer orbit. Pri-
    mary objective was to place satellite into transfer orbit accurate enough
    for spacecraft onboard propulsion systems to place it in planned syn-
    chronous orbit.
       Apogee kick motor was fired at 12:49 pm EST Dec. 20, and Intelsat-
    IV F-3 entered orbit with 36 052.9-km (22 402.2-mi) apogee, 35 745.5-
    km (22 211.2-mi) perigee, 1442-min period, and 0.47â€™ inclination.
    Satellite would drift from position at 284.2â€™ east longitude to perma-
    nent station over Atlantic at 19.5O west longitude by end of January
    1972.
       Zntelsat-ZV F-3 was second comsat in Intelsat IV series. Satellite
    was 238 cm (93.7 in) in diameter and 528 cm (208 in) high and
    weighed 1412 kg (3090 Ibs) at launch. It had 12 transponders, provid-
    ing 12 TV channels and 3000-9000 telephone circuits, and was capa-
    ble of multiple-access and simultaneous transmissions. Expected life-
    time was seven years. Intelsat-lV F-2 had been launched Jan. 25 and
    was operating satisfactorily over Atlantic. (NASA Proj Off; ComSat-

December 19: Detailed Tass description of Mars 2 and 3 missions with dia-
    grams of spacecraft and landing procedures appeared in Soviet news-
    papers. Enroute to Mars, spacecraft had measured solar wind particle
    streams, measured parameters of interplanetary magnetic fields, de-
    termined electron concentrations in interplanetary medium, studied
    solar radio emissions with Soviet-French Stereo-1 experiment, and
    studied spacial structure, directivity, and mechanism of radiation
    processes. In Mars orbit spacecraft had investigated Mars solar wind
    flow and its interaction with Mars ionosphere, recorded spectrum of

     charged particles and variations in magnetic field, and measured re-
     fraction of radiowaves.
        Mars 3 descent package had transmitted pictures only briefly after
     landing on Mars surface Dec. 2, Tass said: â€œAt the computed time, the
     transmission of video pictures was begun and continued for about 20
     sec. During that period a small part of a panorama was transmitted in
     which no discernible details were detected because of [the lack of]
     contrast. Now, it is still difficult to say what caused the termination of
     the transmission. It is possible that it was associated with the local
     peculiarities in the landing area, which are completely unknown, or
     with the dust storm raging at the time. Apparently the dust storm
     acted as a â€˜veilâ€™ covering the surface details during the panoramic
     exposure. The sudden cessation of signals made it impossible to obtain
     information from the scientific equipment.â€
         Orbiting vehicle carried infrared radiometer, two TV cameras,
     photometer, and instruments to measure COZ and determine water
     vapor content, surface radio-brightness temperature, and atmospheric
     density. (Sou Rpt, 12/31/71,1-14)

  Italyâ€™s Sun Marco 3 (launched April 24! by NASA) was adjudged suc-
     cessful. Satellite had transmitted excellent data on density, composition,
     and neutral-particle atmosphere at altitudes of 222-723 km (127.9-
     449.2 mi). Only failure had been in sun sensors, which were not
     essential to mission success. Sun Marco 3 had reentered Nov. 28 after
     more than seven months in orbit and had taken good measurements
     during reentry phase. (NASA Proj Off)
December 21: First complete details on Mars 2 and 3 instruments were tel-
     exed by Soviet scientists to NASA scientists at JPL over direct line in-

     said Soviet Mars spacecraft each had two radiometers, four photome-
     ters, one magnetometer, one ion trap, one spectrometer, and device to
     measure cosmic radiation. Analysis of data from Mars probes had been
     delayed while Soviet scientists investigated interruption of TV trans-
     mission from capsule dropped on Mars by Mars 3 Dec. 2. Message did
     not state cause of interruption or whether transmission had resumed.

December 27: U.S.S.R. launched two satellites from Plesetsk. Cosmos 470
    entered orbit with 2572km (159.7-mi) apogee, 190-km (118.1-mi)
    perigee, 88.9-min period, and 65.4O inclination. It reentered Jan. 6,
    1972.
       Oreol, joint Soviet-French experiment in Arcade program to study
    upper atmosphere at high latitudes and determine nature of polar
    lights, entered orbit with 2477-km (1539.2-mi) apogee, 400-km (248.6-
    mi) perigee, 114.6-min period, and 73.9O inclination. Satellite carried
    instruments to study spectrum of proirons and electrons, to measure
    integral intensity of protons, and to determine ionic composition of
    atmosphere. (GSFC SSR, 12/31/71 ; 1/31/72 ; Tass, FBIS-SOV-71-249,

* U.S.S.R.â€™s Mars 2 and Mars 3 had discovered presence of oxygen and
    atomic hydrogen in Marsâ€™ upper atmosphere, Tass announced. Hydrogen
    corona was located at altitude of 10 000-20 000 km (6200-12 400 mi)
    above surface, and oxygen at 700-1000 kin (435-620 mi). Spacecraft
    also measured temperature changes on Martian surface. Individual areas
    on diurnal side did not exceed 258 K (-lSâ€C, or 5OF). On nocturnal
    side, temperature in some regions exceeded that of environment by
    20-25 K (20-25OC, or 68-77â€™F). (FBIS-SOV-71-249, 12/28/71, L2)
* NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences had agreed on substance and
    mechanics of future exchanges of medical and biological data on
    their experience in manned space flight, NASA announced. Agree-
     mentâ€™s details were contained in recommendations of joint working
    group on space biology and medicine which met in Moscow Oct. 9-13.
    Group-cochaired by Dr. Charles A. Berry, NASA Director for Life
    Sciences, and Dr. N. N. Gurovsky of U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health and
    Academy of Sciences-recommended that meetings be held at least
    once annually, with next meeting held in U S . during May 1972;
     working sessions be held to consider ways io predict state of human
     organism during and after space flights, response of certain body sys-
    tems to space environment, techniques of dysbarism prevention,
    methods of preflight and postflight medical observations, and methods
     and results of biological experiments ; and cochairmen explore possi-
     bility of an exchange of one or two specialists to work in laboratories
     doing similar biomedical research in space programs of U.S. and
    U.S.S.R. (NASA   Release 71-251)
* NSF interdisciplinary conference at Franklin Institute in Philadelphia
     celebrated 400th anniversary of birth of Johannes Kepler. Kepler-
     astronomer, mathematician, and physicist-had         devised laws of plan-
     etary motions in early 17th century. Laws were â€œjust as valid today
     as at the time of their announcement,â€ Science said. (Science, 10/

     some pick-up in orders for transports is anticipated.â€ DOD procurement
     policies â€œwhich nearly threw a few companies into bankruptcyâ€ had
     been revised. â€œMost important there is a growing awareness that the
     Soviet arms buildup poses a real threat to US. security, which new
     weapons must be developed to counter.â€ Persuasive but â€œcynicalâ€
     argument for lift in aerospace business in 1972 was political expediency.
     â€œOver half-a-million people have been laid off in the industry since
     1968, some 200,000 in California,â€ state with largest number of
     electoral votes. Barrons quoted political observer as saying, â€œStarting
     pretty early next spring, youâ€™re going to see a massive injection of
     funds into aerospace.â€ (Barrons, 12/27/71 )
December 28: U S . Patent No. 3 631 294 was awarded to Steven R. Hofstein,
     President of Princeton Electronics, Inc., for Lithicon, first electronic
    storage tube to record on silicon and silicon dioxide. Tube, with target
     area consisting of more than 10 million silicon storage elements, had
     been used by JPL to record Mariner 9 Mars photos, by airlines and
     Federal agencies to inspect parcels that might contain bombs; by hos-
     pitals for brief x-ray and sonar exposures, and by libraries to retrieve
    microfilmed publications. (Jones, NYT, 1/1/72,25)
* International Institute for Strategic Studies was quoted as saying in Lon-
     don that 30 to 70 new Soviet Sukhoi Su-11 delta-wing advanced fighter
     aircraft had been delivered to Soviet Air Force in Egypt. Aircraft were
    believed to be capable of mach 2.5 speed and were armed with air-to-
    air missiles. (Reuters, CSM, 12/28/71, 2)
December 29: U.S.S.R. launched Meteor 10 from Plesetsk to â€œobtain mete-
     orological information necessary for an efficient weather forecasting
    service.â€ Orbital parameters: apogee, 890 km (553 mi) ; perigee, 876

  NASA telexed thanks to Soviet scientist Dr. I. A. Zhulin for â€œvery informa-
    tive transmissionâ€ of Mars 2 and 3 data that included description of
    instruments [see Dec. 211 and forwarded Mariner 9 uv spectrometer
     results. Message, signed by Mariner 9 Program Manager Dan
    Schneiderman, continued exchange between JPL and Moscow of in-
    formation from U S . and Soviet Mars probes. NASA requested more
                                                                           .

    and said Mariner 9 photo of Mars 3 lander site area was being dis-
    patched by diplomatic pouch. New value for direction of Mars polar
    axis baaed on dynamic considerations was included in NASA message
    to Moscow. NASA noted, â€œAlthough this will probably cause a revision
    of the Mars coordinate system at a later date, we will continue to
    observe the existing convention in describing the positions of visible
    surface features.â€ (NASA Release 71-254)
* Failure Review Board appointed to study malfunction of Delta 85 and
    Delta 86 launch vehicles had completed report, NASA announced. Fail-
    ure of Delta 86, which had failed to orbit ITOS-B Oct. 21, had appar-
    ently been caused by leak in oxidizer systemâ€™s vent valve, which caused
    2nd stage to move from correct attitude. To compensate for disturb-
    ance, attitude thrusters using stored nitrogen gas fired continuously to

    keep rocket properly oriented, depleting nitrogen gas and causing
    rocket to tumble and crashland after reignilion.
       Apparent cause of Delta 85 malfunction while orbiting Os0 7
    Sept. 29 had been nitrogen gas leak in 2nd-stage hydraulic reservoir
    system. Although control of spacecraft had been lost before spacecraft
    separation, satellite had entered slightly elliptical orbit and had ac-
    complished its mission objectives. (NASA Release 71-253)
* In 21 major tests since April 1970, Safeguard ABM system had had 17
    successes, two partial successes, and two failures, Vashington Daily
    News reported. USA officials had termed record highly successful for
    complex weapon system during testing phase. Tests had included inter-
    cepts of missiles fired against Safeguard test network and firing of
    ABMS at predetermined points in space. Most significant test had been
    firing of long-range Spartan ABM from USAâ€™s    Meck Island test complex
    in Pacific. Missile had intercepted incoming enemy warhead after
    picking it out of group of decoys. Spartan had been designed to knock
    down incoming warheads outside atmosphere at 322 km (200 mi) from
    launch site. Superfast Sprint missile was being developed to intercept
    warheads penetrating atmosphere at 40-km (25-mi) distance. About
    35 more major Safeguard iests were planned through mid-1974,
    including tests of missileâ€™s ability to launch and guide large numbers
    of ABMS simultaneously against clusters of simulated warheads, decoys,
    electric jamming devices, and other missile penetration aids. ( PNews,
     12/29/71)
December 30: Mars orbit of Mariner 9 was changed by 17-sec engine
    firing to compensate for effects of dust storm on mission objectives.
    Periapsis was raised from 1388 km (862 mi) to 1650 km (1025 mi) to
    expand area covered in mapping photos and to provide required over-
    lapping of pictures. Mapping would be completed in three 20-day
    cycles with fourth cycle available to fill in open areas where photos
     did not overlap. Period was increased by 1 min 19 sec to place
    periapsis in middle of Goldstone viewing period for maximum data
    return. (NASA Release 71-252; Pasadena Star-News, 12/31/71)

     feasibility of transoceanic air traffic control system that would use
     earth-orbit satellites. Experiment was designed following earlier mis-
    sion analyses by ERC. â€œScheduled for 1973, the year-long experiment
    will determine the technical and operational feasibility of using com-
    munications satellites to give ground control centers precise and un-
     interrupted readings and control of air traffic over the North Atlantic
                                                                           5
    24 hours a day.â€ Experiment would employ two satellites-Ats
    launched Aug. 12, 1969) and ATS-F (to be launched in 1973)-and
    three ground stations. PLACE would be able automatically to pinpoint
     to within one mile [1.6 km] actual positions of up to 250 aircraft,
    update information once a minute, and predict locations between up-
    dates. Operational PLACE system could reduce flight-corridor widths
    to 48 km (30 mi) and aircraft spacings from 15- to 5-min intervals,
    permitting same corridors to accommodate 12 times as much traffic
    without affecting flight safety. In bad weather, PLACE could simul-
    taneously reroute every aircraft within flight corridor. Although
     PLACE was geared only to North Atlantic air traffic, â€œit is the fore-
    runner of what could become a worldwide satellite air traffic and sur-
    face control network.â€ (Rendezvous, Summer/Fall, 71, 9-11 ; Aero-

* Dr. Charles S. Sheldon 11, Chief of Science Policy Research Div. of
    Library of Congressâ€™ Congressional Research Service, reviewed Soviet
    space program in AIAA Student Journal. Soviet programâ€™s physical
    size and upward pace â€œsuggests it exceeds in real terms the U.S. pro-
    gram at its previous maximum.â€ In contrast to U.S. program-
    which had been eroded as programs ended and technical man-
    power teams broke up-Soviet        â€œapplication of resources to a broad
    program of space flight has continued fairly steadily upward toward
    an ultimate level which has not yet been publicly defined.â€
       Soviet program began its space flights with adaptation of its first
    ICBM, SS-6 Sapwood. â€œThis vehicle, with improved upper staging, is
    still the mainstay of the present program while our corresponding, but
    very small, Redstone and Vanguard first stages have long since dis-
    appeared into history.â€
       Largest single element in total U.S.S.R. program was Cosmos
    reconnnaisance satellite, which stayed in low-circular orbit a few days
    and was then recovered and which represented â€œrather passive military
    support flights.â€ Other elements with direct weapon implications were
    special uses of SS-9 Scarp ballistic missile carrier with space versions
    F-1-r carrying fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) and
    F-1-m      carrying highly maneuverable payloads. Some payloads
    launched by F-1-m â€œseem almost certainly aimed at developing the
    techniques of rendezvous with uncooperative spacecraft to inspect
                                                                   ..
    them and, if need be, destroy them. In a series of flights .       such
    inspectors have made close passes on other Soviet payloads and then
    have themselves been blown into clouds of debris. At least one, instead
    of being destroyed . . . was deliberately redirected to plunge into the
    atmosphere and ocean.â€ (AZAA Stu J , 12/71, 14-28)

* Attributes of Q-fan engine for STOL propulsion were described in Aero-
    nautics & Astronautics article by George Rosen, United Aircraft Corp.
    Hamilton Standard Div. engineer: â€œQ-Fan, with its lightly loaded
     rotor, operating at low tip speeds and incorporating controllable-pitch
     blading, is now essentially available as a new propulsor uniquely
    matched to the stringent performance, noise, and operational require-
     ments of the advanced STOL transport. It offers the aircraft designer
     flexibility in meeting the specific requirements of a given aircraft with
     a limited number of available core engines. By varying the size of the
     Q-Fan, the bypass ratios available . . . could range from 15:l to 30:1,
    or more if needed.â€ (A&A, 12/71,50-5)
  Slackening of US. R&D was scored by Eberhardt Rechtin, Principal
     Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering in DOD, in
    Astronautics & Aerowutics article: â€œThe image of world technical
    leadership earned by our electronics and aerospace industries in the
     1960s will predictably be eroded in the 1970s by our own lack of
    planned â€˜firstsâ€™ in contrast with the continuing achievements of the
     Soviet Union, France, and probably Germany and Japan.â€ Major
    source of future wealth â€œmust be the special skills of our population-
     yet we are presently pricing ourselves out of the world markets, in-
    cluding our own. We are also disseminating our science, our inventions,
    our management expertise, and our manufacturing technologies around
     the world in a way which, though it raises the standards of living
     elsewhere, also diminishes the competitive advantages of our own peo-
     ple.â€ While U S . had been world leader in R&D less than 25 yrs, â€œyou
     hear discussions about reordering national priorities as if we could
     make unilateral decisions, independent oâ‚¬ the international competition
     -as if international int$ractions were not a significant, much less a
     driving, â‚¬actor-concerning defense R&D, the NASA space program, tax

                             Summary
During 1971: U S . orbited 51 spacecraft in 29 launches-including Apollo
    14 and 15 CSMS Kitty Hawk and Endeavor with LMS Antares and
    Falcon and their S-IVB stages intentionally crashed onto moon.
    U.S.S.R. orbited 97 payloads in 83 launches; Japan, 2; U.K., 1;
    France, 1; Italy, 2 ( 1 for US. on US. booster) ; and Communist
    China, 1. US. total included 33 orbited by DOD in 17 launches and 19
    by NASA in 13 launches. NASAâ€™S total included 1 launched for USAF on
    behalf of NATO, 1for France, and 1for U.K.
       NASAâ€™s manned space flight program contiiiued with launches of
    Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 manned lunar landing missions. Mobile equip-
    ment transporter, used for first time on ApoZlo 14 to carry equipment
    and samples, allowed astronauts to explore 3.5 km (2.2 mi) of lunar
    surface and collect 43 kg (94.8 Ibs) of samples. On Apollo 15, astro-
    nauts traveled 28 km (17.41 mi) over lunar surface on four-wheeled,
    battery-powered lunar roving vehicle (LRV)Rover and collected 77 kg
     (170 lbs) of lunar samples, including one white anorthosite rock about
    4 billion yrs old.
       Unmanned program was highlighted by Mariner 9 Mars probe, which
    traveled 400 million km (248 million mi) to Mars and began trans-
    mitting photos of major Mars dust storm and, later, of details of
    Martian surface and moons Deimos and Phobos. Mariner 8 launch vehi-
    cle malfunctioned at launch. Os0 7 Orbiting Solar Observatory-res-
    cued from initially incorrect orbit by ground command-made          first
    x-ray observations of beginning solar flare and revealed that sun had
    CL
      polar caps.â€ Other unmanned missions included Intelsat-IV F-2 and
    Intelsat-IV F-3 for ComSatCorp and Explorer 43, Explorer 44, and
    Explorer 45 (the last launched for NASA by Italy). Launched as sec-
    ondary payloads were Subsatellite on Apollo 15 and Tetr 3 on Os0 7.
    All elements of Skylab flight system reached final manufacturing and
    checkout in preparation for 1973 launch and intensive engineering
    studies on Space Shuttle were conducted throughout year.
       In joint NASA-USAF lifting-body program, M2-F3 and X-24A lifting
    bodies made 17 flights, including first supersonic flight by M2-F3.
    X-24A reached 1687 km per hr (1048 mph) before completing pro-
    gram and beginning modification for new flight program as X-24B.
       In aeronautics NASA TF-SA jet aircraft with supercritical wing
    made 27 successful flights. USN F-14 fighter aircraft successfully dem-
  I




    onstrated first automatically programmable variable sweep wing. USA
    CH-aB helicopter set new world altitude record of 5120 m (16 798
    ft) while carrying 10 000-kg (22 000-lb) payload. New V/STOL Wind
    Tunnel at LaRC became operational, providing greatly improved testing
    capability for scaled models. GE quiet experimental engine success-
    fully completed initial tests in NASA program to reduce jet engine
    noise, and NASA let competitive design contracts for development of
    quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (QUESTOL) transport

    gram.
        In sounding rocket program, 126 successful flights were made to
    study atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomagnetic storms,
    meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations and to make astro-
    nomical observations in x-ray, UV, and radio regions of electromagnetic
    spectrum.
       DODâ€™S 33 payloads included orbiting of 2 Defense Satellite Commu-
    nications System (DSCS-2) military comsats, 2 OV-I scientific satel-
    lites, and Cannonball 2 and Musketball.
       U.S.S.R.â€™s 83 launches set an all-time record in number of flights.
    The 97 payloads included 81 Cosmos satellites, 2 Luna, 2 Soyuz, 1
    Salyut, 2 Mars, 1 Intercosmos, 4 Meteor, 2 Molniya I, 1 Molniya 11,
    and Oreol (launched for France). Soyuz 11, carrying three-man crew,

    successfully rendezvoused and docked with unmanned Salyut 1 to form
    first orbital scientific station, but cosmonauts died during earth re-
    entry because of improperly sealed hatch. Murs 2 and Murs 3 dropped
    instrumented capsules on Mars surface. Mars 2 capsule crashlanded
    and Mars 3 capsule transmitted 20 sec. Lunokhod 1 lunar rover carried
    to moon on board Luna 17 Nov. 17, 1970, continued to explore lunar
    surface until October 1971, when isotope heat reserves were exhausted
    during its 11th lunar night.
       Japan launched two satellites-Tansei and Shinsei. China launched
    Chicom 2, France launched Tournesol, U.K. launched Prospero, and
    Italy launched Sun Murco 3. (NASA Release 71-245; NASA Lifting Body

  NASAâ€™s scientific and societal achievements advanced national goal of
    alleviating environmental problems and expanding basic research on
    behalf of humanity, as public pressed for immediate, usable returns
    from research in all fields. Apollo manned missions swelled storehouse
    of lunar information. Unmanned astronomical missions gathered
    unique data, including new clues to Martian atmosphere. NASA-devel-
    oped inventions saw increased use beyond space exploration-in envi-
    ronmental sciences, communications, medicine, industry, and agricul-
    ture. US.-U.S.S.R. space meetings set stage for future joint space
    missions. And balanced program of space and ,aeronautics, despite
    low funding level, continued to raise US. prestige as aerospace pio-
    neer while it worked to improve manâ€™s future. Some observers, how-
    ever, warned of higher rate of technological advances abroad than in
    U S . and of ever-growing U.S.S.R. space program and technological
    capability. Soviet expenditures on space were estimated at level about
    double U S . peak expenditure of 1% of GXP when combined NASA-DOD
    space program was at highest level and four times present level.
       Dr. James C . Fletcher was nominated new NASA Administrator by
    President Nixon. President of Univ. of Utah and former aerospace
    executive, Dr. Fletcher took office April 27. He succeeded NASAâ€™s  third
    Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, who had resigned Sept. 15, 1970,
    to return to industry. Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator,
    had served as Acting NASA Administrator in the interim.
       Operating at lowest budget level since 1962, NASA in 1971 continued
    phase-out of Apollo program with successful completion of Apollo 14
    and 15. Manâ€™s fourth landing on moon, in Apollo 15 mission, proved
    to many that man had an effective scientific role in space. At yearâ€™s
    end, Apollo 16 had been scheduled for March 1972, with Apollo 1 7
    to complete program later in year.
       Reduced funding forced additional reduction of personnel as well
    as program cutbacks, stretching out remaining Apollo missions, de-
    laying first Skylab flight, and slowing studies of space shuttle. NERVA
    nuclear rocket engine program was reduced to holding action. Bio-
    science funding was eliminated. Aerospace employment in industry
    throughout nation also fell, reflecting cuts in DOD spending as well as
    in NASAâ€™s.
       During year, however, Skylab hardware manufacture neared com-
    pletion and space shuttle work continued. Shuttle preliminary design
    contracts were extended so that NASA could examine alternative con-

    ing of resources was scheduled for 1972. During 1971, instrumented
    aircraft measured air pollution, investigated corn blight infestation,
    and sought hidden natural resources. Pioneer-F spacecraft for planned
     1972 launch and December 1973 Jupiter flyby went into final manu-
    facturerâ€™s tests. Increased emphasis on aeronautics included research
    into aircraft noise reduction, increased air transport efficiency with
    use of supercritical wing, and STOL aircraft for transportation.
        To emphasize practical goals of space science, NASA established new
    Office of Applications, increased technology utilization budget from
    $1 million to $5 million, and issued request for proposals for addi-
    tional uses of space-developed technology to solve problems of society.
    Among NASA projects were NSF contract to investigate use of solar
    cells to electrify homes and buildings and HUD contract to study appli-
    cation of space technology to sewage recycling. Joint NASA-DOT study
    resulted in recommendations for civil aviation R&D policy (CARD).
        Research achievements at NASA centers included ARC discovery of
    amino acids-building blocks of life-in      second meteorite. Discovery
    strengthened case for chemical evolution of life elsewhere in universe.
       NASA FY 1972 appropriation of $3.298 billion was $27 million more
    than requested $3.271 billion and $29 miâ‚¬lion above FY 1971 appro-
    priation of $3.269 billion-ha1 ting downward trend but far below
    1965 peak of $5.250 billion. (A&A 1971; Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 1/2/72,

* In international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched NATOâ€™s
    Natosat 2 military comsat for USAF and NATO, Eole Cooperative Appli-
    cations Satellite for France, Isis 2 cooperative U.S.-Canada iono-
    spheric satellite, and Ariel 4 ionospheric satellite for U.K. Italian crew

       Joint NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences meetings on compati-
    ble spacecraft rendezvous and docking system progressed to discus-
                                                                    Mariner 9
    sion of possible joint test missions. Data obtained by NASAâ€™s
    and Soviet Mars 2 and 3 probes were exchanged under agreement that
    covered broad range of U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in space science
    and applications. Agreement on future exchanges of medical and bio-
    logical manned space flight data called for meetings between U.S. and
    Soviet experts at least annually.
       U.S. and U.S.S.R. exchanged Apollo 11 and 12 and Soviet Lrcrua 16
    lunar samples and Soviet scientists were among 750 experts attending
    Second Annual Lunar Science Conference at Lunar Science Institute
    in Houston. First U.S.-U.S.S.R. Conference on Communications with
    Extraterrestrial Intelligence was held in Soviet Armenia.
       Joint meeting of NASA and European Space Conference (ESC) iden-
    tified candidate areas for possible European participation in U.S.
    post-Apollo space programs, including design and development of
    space shuttle subsystems.
       International Workshop on Earth Resources Survey at Univ. of

    request of U.N. and Jamaican government. NASA signed agreement
    with West Germany for series oi barium-ion-cloud (BIC) probe
    launches, and new sounding rocket agreement was signed with France.
    Under sounding rocket agreement, 20 French Centaure and NASA
    Nike-Cajun rockets would be launched from Kourou Center, French
    Guiana, in cooperative France-U.S. upper-atmosphere research project.
       By end of year NASA had entered into cooperative agreements with
    39 countries, including agreements on lunar samples, tracking and
    data acquisition, and geodetic satellite program. Scientists of 87 coun-
    tries besides U.S. were participating in cooperative ground-based pro-
    grams and personnel exchanges and 62 countries were exchanging
    scientific and technical information. Since the beginning of 1962,
    NASA had launched 21 satellites under international agreements, in
    addition to flying 21 international experiments on NASA satellites.
    Since the beginning of the sounding rocket program, 683 cooperative
    rockets had been launched for research. (NASA Release 71-245; NASA
    Int Aff; â€œSelected Statistics on Intâ€™l Affairs,â€ 2/17/72; A&A, 1971)
  Aerospace industry sales continued anticipated decline in 1971, to $23.3
    billion from $24.9 billion-decrease of 6.3%. Commercial aerospace
    sales, primarily jet transports, increased 7.1% in 1971, from $4.578
    in 1970 to $4.903 billion. Increase reflected increased deliveries of
    wide-bodied jet transports.
       Space sales continued decline, to $3.220 billion from $3.580 billion
    in 1970. Aerospace industry remained nationâ€™s largest manufacturing
    employer during 1971, despite continuing drop in employment from
    1069 000 workers in December 1970 to estimated 931 000 in Decem-
    ber 1971. (Aerospace, 12/72, 3-5)
* Number of aircraft landing facilities in U.S. passed 12 000 for first time,
    with 12 070 airports, heliports, and seaplane bases in operation by
    Dec. 31 despite abandonment of 354. Figure at end of 1970 had been
    261. Texas kept lead with 1128 landing facilities, Alaska was second
    with 762, and California was third with 746. Of national total, 4418
    facilities were classified as publicly owned and 7652 as privately owned.

                    A CHRONICLE FOR 1971

   The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Leonard C.
Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress.
Sources included the United Nations Public Registry; the Satellite Situa-
tion Report issued by the Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight
Center; public information releases of the Department of Defense, NASA,
NOAA, and other agencies, as well as those of the Communications Satellite
Corporation. Russian data are from the U.N. Public Registry, the SateZZite
Situation Report, translations from the Tass News Agency, statements in
the Soviet press, and international news services reports. Data on satellites
of other foreign nations are from the U.N. Public Registry, the Satellite
Sitwtion Report, governmental announcements, and international news
services reports.
   This tabulation lists payloads that have (a) orbited; (b) as probes,
ascended to at least the 4000-mile altitude that traditionally has distin-
guished probes from sounding rockets, etc.; or (c) conveyed one or more
human beings into space, whether orbit was attained or not. Furthermore,
only flights that have succeeded-or at least can be shown by tracking data
to have fulfilled our definition of satellite or probe or manned flight-are
listed. Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. An
asterisk by the date marks dates that are one day earlier in this tabulation
than in listings which are referenced to Greenwich Mean Time. A double
asterisk by the date marks dates of Soviet launches which are a day later
in this compilation than in listings which are referenced to Greenwich Mean
Time.
   World space activity increased for the second straight year. There was
an increase in the total succesful launches-120 against 114 in 1970-and
a marked increase in total payloads orbited-151 against 130 in 1970. The
difference between launches and payloads is of course accounted for by the
multiple-payload launches (DOD, the principal user of this system in the
past, made 5 multiple launches in 1971, orbiting 21 payloads; NASA made
only 2 multiple launches, totaling 4 payloads; the U.S.S.R. made 2 multiple
launches, orbiting 16 payloads).
   Of the 1971 world total, the United States launched 29 boosters carrying
47 payloads-up from 28 and 36 in 1970 and marking the first U.S. in-
crease of both categories in one year since 1966. Of the 1971 totals, DOD
was responsible for 17 launches and 33 payloads. Five of NASAâ€™s 12 launches
were non-NASA missions-Intelsat-IV F-2 and Intelsat-IV F d for ComSat-

Corp, Natosat 2 for the USAF and NATO, Eole Cooperative Applications Satel-
lite for France, and Ariel 4 ionospheric research satellite for the U.K. The
Soviet Union again dominated world totals, launching 97 payloads (a high
for the U.S.S.R.) with a record 83 launches. It had launched 88 payloads
with 81 launches in 1970.
   The year was marked by success and tragedy. The US. accomplished two
spectacular manned Apollo lunar flights, but the Soviet record flight of the
worldâ€™s first manned earth orbiting laboratory returned to earth with its
crew dead. Apollo 14 made the third successful U.S. manned lunar landing
and returned with 43 kg (94.8 lbs) of lunar samples. Apollo 15 returned
with 77 kg (170 lbs) of lunar material and employed the lunar roving
vehicle for the first time on the moon. The US. also successfully photo-
graphed Mars and its moons with Mariner 9 and made the first x-ray
observations from a spacecraft of a beginning solar â€˜flare and of solar
streamers with Os0 7 .
   Early in the year, the Soviet Union orbited Sulyut 1, a large unmanned
station. The three-man crew of Soyuz 10 docked with the station but en-
countered some difficulties and returned quickly to earth. More than a
month later the three-man crew oi Soyuz 11 docked with Salyut 1, trans-
ferred to it, and conducted experiments from the linked spacecraft before
undocking and returning in the Soyuz 11. Although the Soyuz 11 mission
set a new world endurance record for the longest manned space flight-
nearly 24 days-the three Soviet cosmonauts died just before reentry when
an imperfect hatch seal vented their air supply. Mars 2 orbited the planet
Mars and placed the first man-made object-a capsule bearing the Soviet
coat-of-arms-on the surface. A capsule ejected five days later from Mars 3
sent back video signals for 20 seconds from the planetâ€™s surface before
shutting down. Luna 18 orbited the moon but crashed on its landing attempt.
Luna 19 went into lunar orbit and remained there to conduct research
and take photographs.
   Also during 1971, the United Kingdom became the sixth nation to orbit
a satellite (Prospero) with its own launch vehicle. Japan launched two of
its own satellites (Tamei and Shinsei), and the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China
launched its second satellite ( M a 0 2). In addition to launching its own
satellite (Tournesol), France participated in a cooperative launch with the
                                                            Explorer 45 and
Soviet Union, which orbited Oreol. Italy launched NASAâ€™s
its own San Marco 3 on NASA vehicles from its facility off the coast of
Kenya.
      As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of
these appendixes is never complete, because of the inescapable lag behind
each flight of the analysis and interpretation of results.

                           Appendix â‚¬5
  CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES, 1971

   This chronology of major NASA launches in 1971 is intended to provide an
accurate and ready historical reference, compiling and verifying information
previously scattered in several sources. It includes launches of all rocket
vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by NASA or under
â€œNASA directionâ€ (e.g., in 1971 NASA provided vehicles and launch facilities
and launched ComSatCorpâ€™s two Intelsat IV satellites and NATOâ€™s     Natosat 2,
as well as Isis 2 in a joint US.-Canadian program, Eole in a cooperative
US.-France program, and Ariel 4 in a cooperative US.-U.K. program; also,
under a NASA and University of Rome agreement, an Italian team launched
a NASA satellite, Explorer 45, from Italyâ€™s San Marco platform off the coast
                     Scout booster; an Italian-built spacecraft, Sun Marco 3,
of Kenya, on NASAâ€™s
also was launched by the same team from the same site using a NASA Scout).
   An attempt has been made to classify performance of both the launch
vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of primary
mission. Three categories have been used for evaluating vehicle performance
and mission results-successful (S), partially successful ( P ), and unsuc-
cessful (U). A fourth category, unknown (Unk), has been added for pay-
loads when vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to exercise
its main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary; many of the
results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they ignore the fact that a great
deal is learned from missions that may have been classified as unsuccessful.
   Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. Open sources
were used, verified when in doubt with the project offices in NASA Head-
quarters and with NASA Centers. For further information on each item, see
Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chronology as
referenced in the index. The information was compiled in May 1972 by
Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library
of Congress.

                           Appendix C
  CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPAclE FLIGHT, 1971
   This chronology contains basic information on all manned space flights
during 1971 and, taken with Appendix C to the 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969,
and 1970 volumes of this publication, provides a summary record of manned
exploration of the space environment through 1971. The information was
compiled by Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of
the Library of Congress.
   The year 1971 saw a moderate increase in manned space flight activity.
Contrasting with 1970, in which one US. Apollo flight and one Soviet Soyuz
flight placed only 5 men in space, 1971 saw two Apollo and two Soyuz
flights place a total of 12 men in space.
   After last yearâ€™s Apollo 13 mission failure, the 1971 success of Apollo 14
demonstrated again the viability of the Apollo system. Two of its astronauts
spent nearly 9+â€ hours exploring the moonâ€™s surface and returned with
43 kg (95 lbs) of lunar material. These accomplishments were virtually
doubled six months later when Apollo 15â€™s lunar crew spent more than 181/2
hours exploring the moonâ€™s surface and employed the lunar roving vehicle
for the first time. The crew returned to earth with about 77 kg (170 Ibs) of
lunar samples.
   The Soviet three-man Soyuz 10 docked with Salyut 1, a huge unmanned
space station launched four days earlier. Some difficulties were encountered,
for no crew transfer was effected and Soyuz 10 returned to earth 14 minutes
short of a two-day flight. Soyuz 11 initially met with better luck. It docked
with Salyut 1 and transferred its three-man crew to inhabit the station.
After conducting many successful experiments and setting a new world
record for the longest manned space flight, the three Soviet cosmonauts
returned to Soyuz 11 but died just before reentry when an imperfect hatch
seal vented their air supply.
   By the end of 1971, the United States had conducted a total of 25 manned
space flights-2 suborbital, 16 in earth orbit, 3 in lunar orbit, and 4 lunar
                  a total of 30 different crewmen. Of the 30 American
landings-with
astronauts, 10 had participated in two flights each, 5 had flown three
times, and 1 had flown four times. The Soviet Union had conducted 18
manned flights, all in earth orbit, with 25 cosmonauts. Three had participated
in two flights each and two had flown three times. Cumulative totals for
manned spacecraft hours in flight had reached 2958 hours 45 minutes for
the United States and 2097 hours 16 minutes for the Soviet Union. Cumula-
tive total man-hours in space were 7796 hours 24 minutes for the United
States and 4403 hours 12 minutes for the U.S.S.R.
   Data on US. flights are the latest available to date within NASA, although
minor details are subject to modification as data are refined. Major aspects
of all US. manned flights remain subject to direct observation by interested
citizens of the world, with a significant portion of recent missions seen live
on worldwide coIor teIevision.
