                              FOREWORD
   The National Aoronautics and Space Act defined the national effort
in the exploration of s p a c e t h e largest, most complex research and
development effort ever undertaken. It also provided for the continu-
ation of the long tradition of research in aeronautics begun under the
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
   During the past five years, an immense effort has been set in motion.
That this effort has borne fruit is evidenced by the events of the years
since the passage of the Act, some of which are recorded in the pages
that follow. These events constitute at least a partial record of the
raw material which is giving shape to the space effort. I n some in-
stances, they represent the growth of space technology and equipment :
improvement in the percentage of successful launches; the develop-
ment of large boosters capable of supporting larger payloads in more
complex missions. The overall increases in reliabdity, sensitivity, and
accuracy of equipment are all signs of the increasjng breadth and
depth of our knowledge of the requirements for space fight. In othw
instances, these events portray our increasing capacity to explore both
the near and far reaches of spaca and to benefit from knowledge gained
by exploration. Though our knowledge has increased at a dramatic
rate, the demand for new information-which has become such a
pressing demand for practical reasons, for defense urposes, and as
part and parcel of the persistent human drive to inow-threatens

   The wide range of events recorded here portray the wide scope of
this tremendous scientific undertaking. But perhaps even more indic-
ative than the variety of events, is the broad social, economic, and
political impact of the many projects and programs. For instance,
Professor Frederic Seitz, President of the National Academy of Sci-
ences, said recently that there was no part of university activity re-
lated to science and technolog "which is not involved in a funda-
mental way in the space effort. Or, in another field, we note that by
the end of 1963, some 65 political entities were cooperating in our
international space program.
   These are developments, perhaps trends, which are emerging as the
S ace Age becomes more and more a part of the Nation's daily life.
TEeir parts are recurded here as past, but, more importantly, they are
also prologue.

  This chronology of the sixth -par of the space age was prepared
 from open public sources. Like its annual ancestors, it was intended
 to rovide a compilation of known events related to the scientific,
   R
 tec nological, organization and policy aspects of space exploration
 and exploitation. Although its index is a ready vehicle for informa-
tI;olra+i.entryit w a s not conceived as historical assessment. It pro-
 vides a comprehensive listing of the growing welter of events in their
 own date and place. The pace and complexity of the challenging and
 sometimes dramatic endeavor as man learns and masters nature
 beyond planet Earth is a t least chronicled in a useful form. Hope-
 fully, it provides some of the much-needed perspective for most
 readers, many of whom are undoubtedly as breathless as contempo-
 rary historians.
    In the re aration of Astrmautks and Aermutics, 1963, Mrs.
 Helen T. b e i s carried major responsibilities for drafting and edit-
 ing. The entire NASA Historical Staff read? screened, and digested
available source materials and comments, including Dr. Frank W.
 Anderson, Jr., Miss Molly Holme, and Miss Sara Corbett. The index
w&s drafted by Miss Nanc Ebert (ATBP). Indispensible contribu-
tions were made by the Ledicated overtime work of Mrs. Dema
                             T
Nappier (AFEE-I)      as well as Center Historians and monitors, in

 Russian materials. Many busy scientific and managerial personnel
 were generous in their comments on preliminary drafts.

January 3: Rep. Bob Wilson (R.-Calif.) speaking for Republican
    Partyâ€™s Advisory Committee for Space and Aeronautics, charged
    Kennedy Administration had failed to build a strong military
    space program and recommended USAF be given authority to un-
    dertake an immediate military .space program with priority over

    suggests surface temperature of Venus may be 600â€ F, as previ-
    ously reported. Meanwhile, radioastronomy studies at JPL,

     make the further distinction that NASAâ€™s AECâ€™S pro ects are

    giant program for a [manned] lunar landing should be reoriented
    to allow for a manned landing on Mars and a manned capture

     of science and technology. Any industrial nation which refuses
     to devote substantial effort to space exploration is incurring the
     hazard of future technological obsolescence of its industries, the
     hazard of potential loss of leadership, and the hazard of military
     surprise by potential enemies . . . .â€ (Text)

     knowled e about the earth on which we live; and knowledge about
     life itself
         â€œThe space program will stretch the abilities and minds of our
      people for years to come. It will provide a continuing, long-term
      stimulant to our economy. The magnitude of the task will test
      the resources and cooperative will of all major elements of our
      society. Still, space exploration, and manned space flight in
      particular, offers the United States the opportunity for unparal-
      leled progress in the future.
         â€œUltimately, within this century, the sum of all our efforts will
      give us the equipment, the knowledge and the skill to utilize space
      as we now utilize the seas and the air.

  USAFâ€™S 1962 launching of six tin dipoles into orbit was disclosed by
    W. E. Morrow of MIT,at annual IAS meeting. The 14-in. dipoles
     were launched to measure effects of solar pressure, air drag, and
     electrical drag on small objects, so that scientists could predict
     how long Project West Ford copper dipoles would remain aloft.
     Lviorrow said the special tin dipoles were following their pre-

January 93: W. Albert Noyes, Jr., prof. of chemistry at Univ. of

      T
    La oratories, proposed theory at American Physical Society in
    New York that would offer a unified concept of nuclear and elec-
    trical forces, heretofore considered separate phenomena, and
    would reduce all matter to two articles-electron and positron.
                                      P
    Sternglass hypothesized that al other particles found in atom
     (30 or more in recent years) are merely combinations and vari-
    ations of negatively-charged electron and positively-charged posi-
    tron. Simplest such grouping is single electron-positron pair,
    whirling near speed of light, which exhibits same properties as
    elementary article known as neutral pi meson. Two such elec-
    tron pairs, ,â€˜fternglass said, exhibit roperties of elementary par-
                                          t
    ticles K meson and Rho meson; ot er systems similarly account
     for all heavy mesons â€œwithin a few per cent of their observed
    values.â€ Combinations of electron-positron pairs with proton
     can explain other elementary particles classed as hyperons.
     Sternglass had assumed that Einsteinâ€™s special theory of rela-
     tivity, which states that an objectâ€™s mass increases with its veloc-
     ity, governs particlesâ€™ behavior; thus, if charged particles move
     fast enough and close enough in their orbits they will generate
     sufficient force to hold atomic nucleus together. (Wash. Post,

  NASA report released on Project Mercury flight MA-8 (Oct. 3,1962),
     in which Astronaut Walter M. Schirra. Jr.. said: â€œI was also
     impressed with the fact that . . . [under the di5erent lighting
     conditions that prevailed, the separated sustainer stage] was al-
     most black in ap earance, rather than the shiny silvery vehicle
     that Astronauts 8lenn and Carpenter had seen at this time and
     that I had observed on the launching pad . . . .
        â€œAt about 10 minutes 30 seconds, I went back to flying-by-wire,
     low, and tracked the sustainer as it traversed down through the
     window, and it was a thrill to realize the delicate touch that it
     is possible to have with fly-by-wire, low. . . . The control system
     was so effective that it just amounted to a light touch and maybe
     a few pulses in either axis to get the response I wanted. I could
     point the spacecraft at anything I wanted to. I could see the
     sustainer and track it, but I do not believe the relative motion
     problem would be so easy to solve that I would be able to steam
          a
     d o n and join u p with it. Although the relative velocity was
     on t e order of 20 to 30 feet per second, it was enough to cause
     a problem, particularly at a time when one is becoming acclimated
     to a new environment. These problems would be difficult to solve
                                                                                       27

    we build up to the rendezvous technique, one will need more time
    than that just at the point of insertion to effect this rendezvous,

    said in address to National Capitol Section of American Rocket

    ness of basic research. On the credit side o the ledger, however,

    provides the foundation not only for our m x t a r y capability but
    for our economic progress as a nation. Thus, in its truest sense,
    basic research is everybodyâ€™s business, and everyone, t o a greater
    or lesser degree, has a responsibility toward it. I believe that this
    responsibility can best be exercised by a partnership of overn-

January 31: Dr. Nancy G. Roman, Chief of Astronomy and Solar
    Physics, NASA O5ce of Space Sciences, at, Marymount College,
    Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson, New York, stated that : â€œThere [is]
    a great deal of discussion of whether the United States should
    have women astronauts, and I am frequently asked for my own
    opinion on this subject. Frankly, it makes little difference to
    me. I believe that there will be women astronauts some time just
    as there are women airplane pilots, but there are so many other
    ways that women can contribute importantly to the space pro-
    gram that the fact there are no women astronauts as yet should
    not worry us . . . . ,
                         9

       NASA had over 146 women who were classified as professional
    Aerospace Technologists, 77 of whom were professional mathe-
    maticians whose responsibility was the programing and opera-
    tion of NASAâ€™s  highly complex computers and similar equipment,
    Dr. Roman said.
       â€œMoreover, I should emphasize that as badly as we need
    scientists and engineers, we also need educated women as well as
    men in other fields and no one, man or woman, should go into
    science simply because of its glamour . . . The space program,
    the country and the world need young peo le who have been
                                                  B

       â€œAlso clear is the quality that is perhaps the greatest virtue of

    professional societies make periodic studies of technical and
    social problems to which enaineering profession should make
    significant contributions, but â€˜for which engineering programs
    and institutions appear to be inadequateâ€œ; (3.) educational insti-

During January: Dr. Douglas McKie, Univ. of London, writing in
    Jan. 1963 Endeavour,traced the history of the metric system, a
    subject of renewed interest in the U.K. since Parliament was con-
    siderin the adoption of the metric system of weights and meas-
          8r.
    ures.       McKie pointed out that the recent adoption of the wave-
    length of a line in the spectrum of krypton-86 as the basis for an
    international unit of length was the realization of an old French
    dream at the time of the adoption of the metric system-the use
    of an invariable natural standard. At the time of the French
    Revolution, Dr. McKie asserted, France had become weary of the
    chaos of variable systems of weights and measures and the govern-
    ment and the National Academy urged the States-General to adopt
    a national system. The States-General authorized the Academy t o
    formulate a system of weights and measures based on measurement
    of an arc of the meridian as the universal standard and decimals as
    the notation system. This was done by 1793, but Revolut,iona.ry
    politics intervened, having done away with the States-General and
    even replaced the Academy. Not until Dec. 10,1799, did the new
    standards become legal, and by then it had been discovered that the
    earth was not a perfect sphere and therefore that the am of the
    meridian was not the invariable standard the Academy had
    thought. (SZlV,Mar. 1963,ll-13)

February 4: Joint AEC-DOD-NASA report on radiation resulting from

    Electrons having minimum altitudes below 500 km are decaying

    [by Bell Telephone Laboratories] have shown a pronounced de-
    crease of intensity in regions associated with flux lines extending
    at the equator to distances of approximately 3 earth radii. Some
    more recent data indicate, moreover, that these secular changes are
    energy dependent. It has been noted that large time fluctuations
    somewhat similar to this phenomena [sic] were previously ob-
    served to occur in connection with the natural belts. The observed
    decrease of intensity in certain regions, and the other associated
    changes in the electron distribution, indicate a complicated phe-

                       5?
     beings, Dr. Tau- i Toong, consultant, USAF OAR, said: â€œTwo
     major difficulties present themselves in a study of such effects in
     earth-bound laboratories; first it is difficult to simulate subgravity
     on earth for long durations and, secondly, it is impossible to scale
     human beings up or down. . . .
        â€œIt was pointed out to the author by Dr.Harold J. von Beckh
     that part of the effort of a human heart is spent to overcome
     gravity. It would seem that a lighter load is imposed on the heart
     of a man on the moon and thus his heart beat slows down. . . .
     The human heart might possibly degenerate to such an extent
     that its beat slows down further to something corresponding to
     the â€˜normal heart beat of an abnormal giantâ€™ on the earth. The
     situation might become even worse should he again return t~ the

      dollar value of NASA prime contracts, 24 were small business con-
      mrns. I n those procurements where small business concerns sub-

 EXPLORER XVI meteoroid detector satellite recorded 16 punctures by
     meteoroids d u e its first 29 days in orbit, NASA reported.
     Charles T. Dâ€™Aiutolo, manager of meteoroid research programs in
    NASA office of Advanced R~xm-cli      and Teclinology, said that Kith
     EXPLORER XVI â€œwe have established conclusively that there are
    micrometeoroids out there which can penetrate thin surfaces.â€
     Other spacecraft had reported hits by cosmic debris, but this was
     first time actual punctures were recorded. I f EXPLORER XVI con-
    tinued as expected to report meteoroid data, for R full year, it
    should enable scientists to determine whether meteoroids are hnz-
    ardous to spacecraft-both manned and unmanned. Dâ€™Aiutolo
    said the satellite, which exposed 25 sq. ft. of surface to meteoroid
    impacts, was not large enough to provide good statistical data on
    larger and rarer particles in space. (Earlier this month, NASA
    announced plans to orbit two meteoroid-detector satellites, each
    with exposure surface of more than 2,000 sq. ft. See Feb. 5.)

    into near-synchronous, 24-hour orbit 22,300-mi. above the earth.
    At about the time the apogee-kick motor completed burning,
    ground stations lost contact with the satellite and could not
    confirm a synchronous orbit. NASA officials assumed that â€œthe
    satelliteâ€™s spin axis was misaligned a t the time of the apogee
    motor f r n . Beatuse of this they have been unable ;to d e t e m e
             iig
    whether the satellite is damaged.â€ Attempts to make contact
    with SYNCOM were continued.
       SYNCOM I was to have hovered a t a nearly b e d longitude over
    the Atlantic Ocean and traced every 24 hours a figure-8 pattern
    approximately 30â€ north and 30â€ south of the equator; this path
    would be close enough to true synchronous o r b i t e i o n a r y
    hovering at speed equal to that of earthâ€™s rotation-to d e b m i n e
    if synchronous orbital communications satellites Fere feasible.
    Experiments with SYNCOM were to have included telephone and
    teletype communications transmitted between nâ€™ea Jersey and
    Lagos Harbor, Nigeria. Syncom was NASA project, supported by

 Astronaut M. Scott Carpenter addressing the USAF School of Aero-

       â€œThe main goal of Project Mercury is to prove the design and
    engineering concept and the usefulness of Man in space, but the
    capabilities of the Mercury system can be streched only so far.
    I had hoped that the flight of â€œAurora Sevenâ€ would be a humble
    beginning in the gathering of scientific data from space about .
    the universe in which we live. I n the three short months that
    preceded the flight, we developed many special instruments for
                    .
    this purpose. . . There is untold wealth of information to be
    gained as a result of space flight if we turn our talents and
    curiosities in that direction.
      â€œI have worked closely with scientists from many fields, but
    perhaps most closely with those in medicine.

    as Syncum . . . . in an attempt to achieve the 24-hour, synchron-

       â€œIshould like to add, finally, that the experience of Telstar and
    Relay .to date have merely reinforced the opinion which I gave
    before this committee last year; that considerable research and
    development have yet to be performed before economic operational

February 19: Lt. Col. Robert E. Warren (U.S. Army), NASA Deputy
    Director of Communications Systems, reviewed launchin and
                                                                     sg
    performance of SYNCOM I communications satellite before enate
    Commerce Committeeâ€™s Subcommittee on Communications. After
    SYNCOM was successfully launched by Delta vehicle, NASA God-
     dard Space Flight Center had determined apogee of SYNCOMâ€™S
     elliptical transfer orbit would occur at 21,700-mi. altitude, about
    600-mi. short of synchronous altitude but well within allowable
     error. So that more nearly synchronous orbit could be achieved,
    signal was sent from USNS Kingsport in Lagos harbor, Nigeria,
     commanding satelliteâ€™s apogee motor to fire 10 min. earlier (at
     5:42 a.m.) than firing time set on onboard timer. SYNCOM re-
    ceived and stored signal, and at 5:42 a.m. signal was sent from
    Kingsport to execute the command. 20.1 sec. later, ground recep-
    tion of satellite telemetry abruptly ceased. Because apogee motor
     was to have fired for 21.2 sec., Colonel Warren said it was â€œdiffi-
    cult to imagine that these two events are unrelated . . . .
       â€œSo,what can we make of all this ? First we know that SYNCOM
    is in orbit. I f the apogee motor did not fire, it is still in the ellip-
    tical orbit and will eventually be found, either by optics or by
    radar. I f the apogee motor did fire, SYNCOM is in a very high
    altitude orbit, and without telemetry, there is only a slim chance
    that it will be found. A search has been organized which will
    continue until such time as it is found, or until further search
    seems unwarranted. I f it is found, we will have another chance
    to try out the command system, and if it works, we could again
    be in business.
       â€œSecondly, we know that one of the communications transpond-
    ers worked well in the transfer ellipse.
       â€œThirdly, we have shown once more that the Delta, launch
    vehicle is a reliable booster, this being its 15th successive flight
    with performance well within amptable error.â€ (Testimony)

Februury BI : Secretary of the Air Force Eugene hl. Zuckert testified
    to the House Armed Services Committee: â€œIn recognition of the
    increased impact of space programs on our national resources
    and their direct effect on our future national security, Air Force
    space activities are closely coordinated with the National Aero-
    nautics and Space Administration. One example is the recent
    agreement between the Department of Defense and the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration on the Gemini program.
    The intent is to insure that the scientific and operational experi-
    ments undertaken as a part of the Gemini program d l be directed
    towards satisfying both military and NASA requirements and
    objectives . . . .
        â€œOur forward space development program integrates the RKTD
    work of many years into a cohesive space program. Fundin for
                                                                     i

     but the program will provide for Air Force space activities for
     the near future.
         â€œThe Air Force has developed a solid foundation of space on
     which military capabilities can be built. These efforts have
                                     significant military space possibilities
                               Utilizing the technological base SO far es-
                                must translate these technical capabilities
     into actual defense systems. The time required to move from a
     development state to operational systems is measured in years.
     Yet, it is the ready military capability, not the technological base,
     that accomplishes deterrence. Accordingly, the Air Force pro-
     poses to begin some of these conversions at once.
         â€œThe forward program aims at two basic objectives :
         â€œFIRST, to enhance the general military posture of the United
      States by building a defense capability in space. Space is not
     only a new area of vulnerability to attack, but also affords impor-
     tant means of supporting the terrestrial forces of the U.S. in
     relation to a military threat posed by a hostile power.
         â€œSECOND, to provide a capability within the space region for
     the purpose of denying to a hostile power the uninhibited military
     exploitation of space, and to provide a system of protection for
      U.S. scientific activities in space . . . .â€ (Text; A-N-AF

         â€œUS. military achievements in space will be expensive. Our

         â€œHowever, as in all previous military progress, risks will dimin-
      ish with experience and can be minimized in early stages by
      thoroughly planned decision points.
         â€œWe must not risk the danger of waiting for the enemy to
      demonstrate a capability before we undertake the development
      of our own. The visible threat to our National security requires

     ing â€œfurther studies on the requirements and design concepts of a
     large launch vehicle consistent with o timum post-lunar-landing

     of the biological science area has demonstrated that specific re-
     coverable satellite flights should be undertaken for the purpose
     of acquiring data on the effects of space environment on living

     should be focused on the research and erelopment problems
     associated with the synchronous altitude class of communication

     passive satellite project, ReboundP, and advanced intermediate
     active satellite projects from hardware development consideration

FebruaTy 96': Results of MARINER 11 flight towards and past Venus
    were detailed in NASA press conference. Analysis of microwave
    and infrared radiometer scans revealed Venus is covered by cold,
    dense clouds in upper atmosphere; preliminary estimate of Venu-
    tian surface temperature was around 800" F. Temperatures are
    essentially same on dark and sunlighted sides of Venus, with a
    cold spot in southern hemisphere. Any carbon dioxide in atmos-
    phere above cloud layer was too small to be detmkd by MARINER
    11's instruments. High-density electron ionosphere was not de-
    tected. Radar obsei-vation on Venus from Goldstone Tracking
    Station established Venus' rotation rate a 230, plus or minus
                                                   s
    40-50 days, retrograde, with 225 days as non-rotating status for
    Venus. This observation together with other ground !measure-
    ments and data from MARINER n's magnetometer indicated Venus
    has very low, if any, magnetic field.
        Analysis indicated solar plasma continuously flows out from
    the sun, velocity of observed solar winds varying from 200 to 500
    miles per second (approximate) and having temperature of about
     l,OOO,OOOo F. Density is normally about 10 to 20 protons and
    electrons per cubic inch. Because solar plasma "carries alo

    with it lines of magnetio force which onginate in the

     from few hundred to a thousand electron vo ts. I n range 0.5 to
      10 mev for protons, "very few exist at times, b u t a t other times
     their flux may be a number of times that of cosmic rays. I n the
     range of energies 10 to 800 mev for protons, there is nearly com-
     plete absence of particles normally [with great number possible
     during solar flare]. Above 800 mev, galactic cosmic rays enter
     interplanetary space and these decrease in numbers quits rapidly

 Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert said in address at
    Patrick AFB : â€œ. . . about our future in space, let me establish two
    bench marks. The first is that the Air Force needs everything it
    can get from NASA. NASA needs us, too, as the record of how NASA
    puts things into space indicates, but if there werenâ€™t a NASA, the
    same facility and capability would have to be created some other
    way.
       â€œThere is reassuring precedent for the principle of having an
    outside-of-defense civilian agency provide the t pe of support we
                                                     &  mmission. Our
    need. The case at point is the Atomic Energy
    own nuclear weapon flexibility as well as the Polaris-carrying
    submarine is su0icient testimony.
       â€œThe clear lasson for us in the space field is that we must put
    requirements on NASA to meet whatever part of our needs can be
   met in this way. We must utilize every possible resource to build
    the necessary military capability and I can assure you that NASA
                                                                      79

   is ready to respond. Jim Webb, the NASA Administrator, harbors
   no illusions about NASAâ€™s   responsibilities in support of national de-
   fense requirements.
      â€œThe second bench mark is that there is no such khing a peace-
                                                                  s
   ful space or military space. There is just space. The new and
   massive space p          m in a civilian ency was launched nearly
                                           â€a
   five years ago, w r - f o r reasons whic seemed not unreasonable
   at the time-a great hullabaloo about peaceful objectives . . . .
      â€œWe have a lot to learn. The recent agreement with NASA for
   joint participation in the Gemini program is one way. That
   agreement represents an answer from both W D and NASA to critics
   who said there was no place in space for military man. Our own
   activity directed toward manned space vehicles will increase, and
   with NASAâ€™s   back-up, weâ€™ll attain the needed capability earlier
   than we would otherwise.
      â€œA term you hear around Washington to denote the areas of
   cooperation between government agencies is â€˜interface.â€™ Here at
   Patrick is one of the primary â€˜NASA-Air Force interfaces.â€™ Such
   terms usually leave me pretty cold but this one does have some
   descriptive value.
      â€œThere will be plenty of problems between the Air Force and
   NASA. but not by any means all at the â€˜interfaceâ€™ points such as
   the Cape. We wouldnâ€™t either one be true to trust or tradition if
   there werenâ€™t. Any machine as big as the national space effort is
   bound to have some kind of friction. But just remember, a clutch
   is a friction interface. Its purpose is to join two shafts for the
   transmission of power.
      â€œThe power we can get will provide protection for the free
   world in space. This was my third point-to make sure that no
   aggressor can exploit space, either for expansionism on earth
   or interference in spam with the peaceful pursuits of the free
   world. . . .â€ (Text)

    gathered during period of minimum solar activity with that
    gathered during IGY (1957-58), when solar activity was a t highest
    level since beginning of systematic observations 200 years ago.
    Many IGY observations would be repeated and special experiments
    made possible by recent scientific advances would be added. IQSY

 Hearings on NASA budget authorization for FY 1964 began before
   House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Administrator
   James E. Webb repeated President Kennedyâ€™s declaration of the
   national goal of making the U.S. â€œthe worldâ€˜s leading spacefaring
   nationâ€™â€™ and achieving for the U.S. â€œa position of pre-eminenceâ€
   in s ace. Mr. Webb testified:
      Lâ€˜fhe mastery of space, and its utilization for the benefit of
   mankind, will not be determined by any single achievement.
   Superiority in the space environment with its great a d v a n t a p
   and benefits will be won and very likely can be held by that nation
   which first fashions into a usable system all of the scientific
   knowledge, all of the technology, all of the experience all of the
   space launch and terminal facilities, and all of the aids to space
   navigation required for safety and regular services.
      â€œThese are the capabilities and resources which the United
   States must have, and this budget is designed to make rapid
   p r o p toward acquiring them.
      â€œivioving from our present position to achieve mastery of space
   requires that we add substantially tu our scientific knowledge and
   to our utilization of technology. The NASA program is progressin
                                                                       3
   on both of these fronts. I n a complex effort such ab this, conducte
   in a new medium about which much is yet unknown, the scientists
   and the engineer inevitably must work closely together and grow
   increasingly dependent upon one another. . . .
                       a
      â€œThe NASA pro am, therefore, is designed to expand both
   science and techno ogy. We are moving forward on a broad front.

      Discussing studies of follow-on projects to manned lunar

   feasibility of assembling a large space laboratory in space rom
   multiple launches with one or another of the available launch

   not justify a project of this magnitude and cost. We are
   attempting to grasp the problem from the other end, that is to
   ask what one can and would do in a space laboratory in specific
   fields of science and technology with a view to establishing a
   realistic and useful concept. We hope that such studies will
   provide the information necessary to justify and support a deci-
   sion to be made in time for the fiscal year 1965 bud et. The

       â€œThe major pro lem remaining in the F-1 engine program is
   the existence of the phenomenon known as combustion instability,
    which is characterized by pressure oscillations in the combustion
   gas inside the engine. Although combustion instability has de-
    veloped in only seven of the 250 F-l firings in the last two years,
    even this small incidence cannot be tolerated. Consequently, we
    are placing major emphasis on solving this problem. The source
    of instability in liquid propellant engines has been the subject of
    considerable research, since most engines exhibit instability in the
   early stages of their development. . . .
      â€œWe are confident that we will solve the instability problem on
    the F-1 engine, just as it has been solved for all other liquid pro-
    pellant engines m use, and we are confident that we can achieve
    the flight rating and delivery schedules. We are, however, giving
   this matter our closest attention and bringing to bear the knowl-
   edge and judgment of the most qualified experts in the United
   States. . . .

 NASA Administrator James E. Webb, in address at Topeka,
   Kansas, traced the historic role of the Federal Government in
   animating science and pointed to the quickening ace of science
   and technology today. Major considerations, wkch â€œmake it
   clear that an understanding of the space environment, and the
                                  r
   development of the technolo which will enable us to operate in
   space, are imperative,â€ Web said.
      â€œFirst, the modern rocket engine, which can operate in the
   vacuum of space . . . has given us and other nations for the first
   time the means to explore and utilize the space medium. Given
   this ability, and the spectacular achievements already made,
   Americans and citizens of other nations assuredly will not remain
   confined to this small planet. We and they will explore space,

   aiid             to c s 2. &iii&g this,
   less than a position at the forefront of that pioneering effort.
      â€œSecond, it is generally recognized, I believe, that our national
   security itself is heavily involved in the space competition. Not
   only our prestige but our capacity for constructive international
   leadership depend upon a superiority in science and technology-
   for economic development of national d e f e n s e t h a t is understood
   and accepted. The nations of the world,.seeking a basis for their
   own future progress and security, continuously pass judgment
   upon our ability a s a nation to make decisions, to concentrate ef-
   fort, to manage vast and complex technological programs in our
   own interest. It is not too much to say that in many ways the
   viability of representative government and of the free enterprise
   system, in a period of rerolutionary changes based on science and
                 is being tested in space.

      â€œThir , our national defense-perhaps even our national sur-

   against us.

March 7: NASA Administrator James E. Webb addressed Kansas
   State Univ. in Manhattan, and said: â€œIt mightâ€˜ surprise you if I
   were to suggest that, in an important sense, Kansas had a part in
   the beginnings of the scientific age in America, almost 160 years
   ago. It was in 1804 that Lewis and Clark camped for three days
   at the junction of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers while en
   route to the Pacific Northwest on the United Statesâ€™ first impor-
   tant scientific exploration.
      â€œAlthough the Congress authorized the investment of only
   $2,500 in that expedition, it established the precedent for a . p w -
   ing federal partlcipation over the next 150 years in scient1 c re-
   search and exploration . . . .
     â€œAnd what of today â€˜1 I n Fiscal Year 1964, Congress is consider-
   ing the investment of almost $15 billion for scientific research
   and development and the tools and facilities with which to do it.

 Discovery of radiation belt around planet Saturn, first reported in
   Physical Review Letters, was described by two physicists of the
   NRL research team, Joseph M. Bologna and Russell M. Sloanak-
   er. From 170 mdioastronomy measurements of Saturnâ€™s radia-
   tion made between July and October 1962, the researchers dis-
   covered that radiation from the planet was too intense to be heat
   emission, and â€œthe only theoretical explanation is radiation from
   electrons spiraling in a magnetic field.â€ Their research indicated
   Saturnâ€™s radiation belt circles the planet from north to south,
   theoretically not so likely as equatorial belts such as those of
   Earth and Jupiter, but Sloanaker said further studies were
   planned with 300-ft. radiotelescope at Green Bank, W. Va., to

   This evidence indicated Van Allen radiation belts, which extend
   to lower altitudes at higher latitudes, possibly are secondary heat
   source for ionosphere. Where ionospheric and radiation particles
   collide, ionospheric temperatures rise and F layers of ionosphere
   become more spread apart-causing radio waves to scatter. (AP,

               revision that we are convinced that t e public interest
   p~-~posed
   is often best served by permitting a contractor or subcontractor
   to retain commercial rights to inventions made in the course of
   doing research and development work funded by NASA-pro-
   vided, of course, the Government acquires a royalty-free license
    for use of the invention for governmental purposes, and pro-
   vided, also, that the invention is actually worked. NASA's      policy
    is intended to encourage use of inventions in two ways: first,
   by bringin the stimuli of the patent system into play and, sec-
                t
   ond, by wit holding the full benefits of waiver until public reali-
   zation of the fruits of the invention have been achieved. Such
   a policy offers many advantages over a restrictive policy which
   would permit contmctnrs to retain atent rights only in the
   exceptional case. The economy shollf not be deprived of the

 Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner, Scientific Advisor to the President,
   testified before Monopoly Subcommittee oYSenate Small Busi-
   ness Committee on the need for flexibility in Government
   patent olicy. "The Department of Defense feels strongly among
            K
   other t ings that the performance of its mission requires the
   ability to assure the contractor a t the time of contracting that
   he will retain commercial rights to his ideas, in order to assure
   the unrestrained participation by the most competent elements
   of American industry in the defense programs . . . . The central
     uestion . . . is whether the terms of the contract mill encourage
   %e contractor to apply his full technical background and experi-
   ence to the Government. These considerations also apply to con-
   tracts of the National Aeronautics and Space Admmistration.
   The national interest requires greater uniformity between DOD
   and NASA patsnt practices since they are drawing on the services
   of the same sector of industrial research and development
   competence.
      ". . . I feel that a reasonable basis for framing a govern-
   ment-wide patent policy can be found. It Seems important for the

   Government to move in the direction of a more consistent policy
   that will eliminate the unhealthy confusion and instabilities that
   attend the present situation. Such a policy should provide for
   the Government to retain title in the range of circumstances that
   I listed earlier; but it is necessary to recognize that, because
   of the problems of the type that concern the Department of
   Defense and NASA, any policy, to be realistic, should enable in-
   dustry to retain exclusive rights in certain circumstances . . . .
   The nature of the work involved, the commercial background of
   the contractor, and the extent to n-hich the contractor would be
   expected to work the invention in the public interest would be
   significant factors in permitting contractors to retain exclusive
   commercial rights . . . .â€ (CR,     3/21/63, 4378)
March 14: Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara visited Boeing
   Co. in Seattle, Wash., and NASA Manned Spacecraft Center in
   Houston, Tex., for briefings on X-20 (Dyna Soar) and Gemini
   projects. I n Houston, McNamara said to press: â€œIn the last six
   months the Department of Defense has completed with NASA an
   agreement on joint planning for the NASA Gemini program. We
   want to see how Gemini and the X-20 can be fitted together to
   make the best program for both military and civilian purposes.
      â€œThe Gemini program provides for two men to be placed in
   orbit in 1964. The X-20 program proposes to place one man in
   orbit at a later date. While the X-20 would be in orbit less time
   than proposed in the Gemini program it would provide more
   recoverable payload because it would use a larger booster. The
   two pro rams are therefore not entirely comparable.
      â€œBut fecause they do have similarities and are both very costly,
   I believe this trip to Seattle and to Houston, Texas, to visit the
   Manned Spacecraft Center where the Gemini program of NASA is
   underway IS extremely important.

   data, Dr. Van Allen said artificial radiation would decrease in
   intensity by factor of three or four until period of increased solar
   activity (around 1967) when decay rats should increase. He also
   said electrons in artificial belt have higher energies (up to a few

March 16: General B. A. Schriever (USAF) told Central Florida
   Medical Meeting, Orlando : â€œThe successful development of
   space technology required major contributions from aerospace
   medicine. These contributions are twofold : first, an increased
   knowledge of the biological problems that will be encountered
   in space flight; and second, the development of equipment and
   techniques that will enable man not only to survive, but also to
   operate effectively in space. We have already made great progress
   through the Air Force high altitude research, through simula-
   tion of the space environment, and through the Mercury program.
   But additional knowledge and experience will be required to
   conduct extensive manned operations in space. . . .
      â€œOne of the major problems to be encountered in manned space
   flight is radiation, which may actually become a limiting factor
   on the duration of flights in a given orbit. This may come from
   several sources-f rom solar flares, from space-ambient radiation
   such as found in the Van Allen belts, or from nuclear devices
   that may be exploded in the earthâ€™s atmosphere. There are two
   approaches which are being taken to the solution of this problem,
   and they may be used in conjunction. The first is shielding,
   which is the current means of protection against radiation. But
   in space systems, where weight is of critical importance, con-
   ventional shielding methods are likely to be out of the question.
      â€œThe second method seeks to make use of a drug with anti-
   radiation properties. Some 1,800 potential antiradiation drugs
   are currently being evaluated, and a number of them appear to
   hold great promise. Several interesting facts have already
   emerged from these studies. For example, cells with less than
   the normal supply of oxygen are protected from radiation damage.
   Stimulating the production of white blood cells and slowing the
   metabolism also protect the cells to some degree against radiation
   damage. Ideally, we would like to discover an antiradiation
   drug that can be administered orally without toxic side
   effects . . . .â€ (Text)

Murch 18: Dr. Wernher von Braun, Director of NASA Marshall Space
   Flight Center testified before House Committee on Science and
   Astronauticsâ€™ bubcommittee on Manned Space Flight : â€œThe F-1
   e n p e development program has an impressive list of accom-
   plishments. A year after the contract was signed full-scale com-
   ponents were undergoing tests, and in 27 months complete engine
   systems testing had begun. Full thrust and full duration tests
   have become routine. The engine has been gimbaled during hot
   firing. We expect successful completion of the Preliminary
   Fli htRatingTeststhisyear . . . .
      â€˜%hen design of the F-1 was begun in 1959, combustion in-
   stability was known to be a potential problem. Accordingly,
   early in the program tests of various injectors for the thrust cham-
   ber were conducted, and a design was selected which had not
   experienced unstable combustion. For about a year, from mid-
   1961 to mid-1962, engine tests were conducted without this
    phenomenon occurring. Then, on June 28 last year we mere test-
    ing development engine #008 on the test stands in California. A
   test run which was scheduled for the full 21/, minutes running
   time was interrupted after 106 seconds of satisfactory per-
   formance by a rupture of a valve casting. The rupture was
   traced to combustion instability. Since this occurrence, several
   cases of combustion instability have taken place.
      â€œThis phenomenon is not unique to the F-1, but has occurred in
   the development of most liquid rocket engines . . . .
      â€˜We are presently concentrating on combustion instability and
   are making progress. With the contractor at Rocketdyne, we
    have made an exhaustive survey of all test data having a bearing
    ontheproblem . . . .

   negotiations by teams of specialists. Agreement would become
   effective after a 60-day waiting period pending possible changes
   by either Government.
      Under the joint. weather satellite program, each nation would
   launch a satellite on a different orbit to collect meteorological
   data, while a 24-hr. cable and radio communications network
   would be established for exchange of information and cloud-cover
   pictures, such data to be made public throughout the world.

    [nuclear] explosions in space. I f the Soviets were to launch a
   space vehicle and explode a nuclear device, a t not too great a
   distance, the United States might gain a good notion of what
   was going on. But we would not possess the type of evidence
   which â€˜would stand up in court,â€™ assuming that we could make
   public us8 of the evidence we have. Hence, we would be reluc-
   tant to move, just as during the Cuban crisis, Washington did
   not move before there was clear photographic evidence of the
   presenceof Soviet missiles . . . .

   Orion assembly from the ground ; unfortunatel?, by using Orion
   propulsion only from orbit, much of the system s utility would be
   lost. An all-fusion technology would eliminate the radioactivity
   and thereby open the road to getting really important payloads
   into space.
       â€œShould the Soviets decide to move into space as a decisive
   military medium, they may em loy Orion techniques even before
   they are able to eliminate d o a c t i v i t y . . . . The brutal twin

March 22: At GSFC Colloquium, John A. Oâ€™Keefe discussed the origin
   and evolution of the moon, submitting his theory that billions of
   years ago the moon separated from the still â€œundifferentiated
   earth,â€ thereafter was subjected to volcanic eruptions, meteorite
   bombardment, and ultimate cooling and transformed into a hard
   cinder-like material. The volcanic dust produced the compam-
   tively smooth lunar maria. I f theory is correct, Oâ€™Keefe said, the
   original dust has long since become firm and constitutes â€œno haz-
   ardâ€ for landings of space vehicles. Oâ€™Keefe supported his theory
    with available evidence on tektites. (Text ; Wash. Post,

    as a physicist in the Department of Agriculture, originating the
    centrifuge method of classifying soils, organizing the biophysical
    lab in 1906. H e joined the Bureau of Standards in 1917 and be-
    came its Director in 1933; his early research resulted in improve-

        Administrator James E. Webb, in address before the Los An-

    %lifornia in the national space program: â€œDuring Fiscal Year
    1962 and the first six months of FY 1963,47 per cent of NASAâ€™s
    prime contracts over $25,000 were awarded to firms in California.
    I f the second ranking state is excluded in each of these years,
    California industries received more NASA prime contract dollars
    than all of the other 48 states combined.

      â€œUnless the nation decides to forego the opportunity it now
   has to insure a pre-eminent position in space, I foresee no pos-
   sibility, certainly not in the near future, that the volume of space
   activity conducted in California will decline . . . It does seem
   likely that as our national investment in space research and devel-
   opment increases, California will find it more difficult to main-
   tain its present percentage of the total . . . .â€
              procurement, Mr. Webb said : â€œIn short, we are making
      NASAâ€™s
   a deliberate effort to use the self-policing forces of the market
   place, to avoid building government competition with industry,
   and also to maintain sufficient managerial and technical capabil-
   ity in our own organization to make certain that our contractors
   are giving us the reliability we must have and the taxpayers a
   dollarâ€™s-worth of work for every dollar we spend.â€œ
      I n reviewing the international aspects of the NASA program,
   the NASA Administrator cited the provisions of the National
   Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, and said: â€œSome citizens,
   who regard military necessities as the prime justification for our
   space effort, find it, difficult to accept the open, unclassified char-
   acter of our civilian space program. Some re ard basic scientific
                                                    t
   results as a national treasure. which should e keDt under lock
   and key, and ask â€˜Why do â€˜we give away our iecrets to the
   Russians?â€™
      â€œThe answer is that our program involves both science and
   technology. There are no red secrets of nature, and it would
   be self-defeating to try to classify the science and principles of
   nature. On the other hand, technological advances and inventions
   are the product of men and effort, and can properly be classified
   and kept from potential enemies where the national interest so
   re uirerj.
      aAccordingly, our national space program moves forward with
   the basic scientific research conducted by the civilian agency,
   available to the whole scientific community, but technological
   development conducted by both NASA and the Department of
   Defense which is shared by both agencies, and classified when
   defense and military interests are involved. I n this manner we
   have protected our national security while making the maximum
    contribution to the advancement of science . . . .â€ (Text)
March 27: I n a letter to Rep. George P. Miller (I).-Calif.), Dr.
   Jerome B. Wiesner discussed the problems of scientific manpower.
       â€œThe manyfold demands for technical manpower draw on the
   same pool of talent-for defense and space, for innovation of
   â€˜civilian products able to compete in a world market, for meeting
   such domestic problems as mass transportation and environmeiital
   pollution associated with a rapidly urbanized society, for medical
   advancement, and for the effective management of our resources
    in such a way that we can help upgrade the way of life of citizens
   throughout the world without downgrading our own. Super-
   posed on these requirements is the need for science, mathematics
    and engineering teachers to meet the rapidly growing college en-
    rollment. A sharp competition for manpower has resulted, par-
   ticularly for the superior individual having advanced training.
                                                                     109
              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS,          1963

    I n that competition, not all sectors of demand have succeeded in
    meeting their needs, and the future outlook is not encouraging.
       â€œFor tlie first time., we are confronted with a plurality of goals
    that may well outstrip our technical manpower resources.
       â€œFaced with the same manpower problem as the Soviet Union,
    how, in a democratic society where each citizen must have a free
    choice of his or her occupation, do we meet this challenge?
       â€œThe urgent need for more individuals having advanced train-
    in is clear . . . . To keep pace with our national needs, it is tlie
      3
    ju gment of the Presidents Science Advisory Committee that
    we should and could increase the number of Ph.D.â€™s each year in
    engineering, mathematics, and physical sciences (EMP) to reach
    7,500 in 1970, the number of masterâ€™s or equivalent to 30,000.
    This annual production of 37,500 advanced degrees by 1970
    should be compared with 15,000 in 1960, 11,000 in 1950.
       â€œA substantial fraction of these new graduates, incidentnlly,
    must, be plo\.red back into the universities for teaching, and
    soon . . . . With regard to students, the major barrier to continua-
    tion of full-time graduate study is financial . . . . Another barrier
    is inadequate graduate facilities . . . . I n addition, there is very
    convincing evidence that some geographical areas produce a much
    greater proportion of doctorates than others . . . . Relatively
    few students are prepared to study more than several hundred
    miles from their homes. It would thus appear that we have a
                                                                      dis-
    special problem in terms of meeting an unequal geog~npliical
    tribution of centers of educational excellence.
       â€œThe present barriers to graduate edu~%tion-limitations in
    student support, number of faculty, and educational facilities-
    must be overcome. It is to that end that the President has pro-
    posed that the Federal Government take the initiative and pro-
        -
    vide the leadership needed to meet these national needs.
       â€œ1â€™0 meet goais for graduate education in the three iieids of
    potential shortage-engineering, mathematics, and physical sci-
    ences-it is of critical importance that we increase the number of
    graduate students enrolling in tlie fall of 1964 from the 88,000
    which may be expected on the basis of projected trends to some
    30,000 . . . . Support would be provided within existing legisla-
    tion, through NSF, mc, and NASA fellowships, and through lien-
    XSF science development and training grant programs . . . . I n
    virtual1 all of these cases, assistance to students would be accom-
            i
    panied y a grant directly to the college or university to help
    meet the true cost of education, and thus would assist tlie uni-
    versity to maintain an internal balance between fields . . . . The
    President also proposes Federal support for new physical f acili-
    ties . . . .
       â€œThe proposed program is designed to achieve a substantial

    vanced degrees in these three fields.â€ (NASA Leg. Act. Rpt. 11/86,

                                     f
     has shown that true progress in any branch of technology such as
     space technology requires and even demands a sharp cutting edge
     of advanced research. The kind of things we read about in the
     papers like the manned spaceflight effort, scientific probes, com-
     munications, and meteorological satellites and airliners we ride
     on today all rest upon a foundation of research which was done
     in previous decades; and the research we do today in our labora-
     tories and universities, in industry derives vigor and freshness
     from the motivations of these projects and things that we are
     doing to benefit mankind.
        â€œAt the same time, there is really a feeding in both directions.
                                                                  ring
     The research derives freshness from the things that are
     in the way of projects and the projects later derive bene ts from    On
     the research . . . .â€ (Transcript)

112           ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1 9 6 3

   basic policy questions repeatedly raised concerning the US. space
   program were :
      (1) â€œIs ex loration of the moon an objective of suflicient value
                 f
   to our drive or space leadership to warrant a btal investment of
   as much as $20 billion in this decade, and in the next fiscal year
   at a rate that requires two-thirds of our [NASA] space budget?â€
      (2) â€˜<Is  the ace a t which we are proceeding and the rats of
                     K
   expenditure w ich is required to explore the moon by 1970,
   necessary to insure eventual pre-eminence in space, and reasonable
   in the light of our other pressing national needs?â€
      I n speaking to these questions, Mr. Webb traced the evolution
   of the U.S. space program and the determination of the national
   objectives in space after the strategic surprise of SPUTNIH I. He
   discussed the central considerations of world leadership in science

March 29: British Minister of Aviation Julian Amery announced
   U.K. had ordered a design study to determine suitable communi-
   cations satellite system, the satellites to be placed in orbit by ELDO
   vehicle (European Launcher Development Organization). To
   be undertaken by Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough
   and Signals Research Development Establishment at Christ-
   church, studies would consider : network of medium-altitude-orbit
   satellites, probably at least 12 ; system of stationary-orbit satel-
   lites, calling for much smaller number of satellites; use of
   Woomera rocket range, Australia, for launchings. U.K. was
   hopeful that such a system could be established in cooperation
   with European countries but independent of U.S. â€œNo one coun-
   try should have a monopoly of space,â€ Amery said. H e also aii-
   nounced that contracts to industry for a third Ariel satellite, to be
   launched by U.S. rockets but to be built entirely by U.K., mould be
   awarded soon. (Wash. Post, 3/30/63; Av. Wk., 4/8/63,38)

      â€œThe space program, in my opinion, is downright spongy.
   This is an area where we particularly need to demonstrate
   some commoii sense. Specifically, I have never believed that a
   spectacular dash to the moon, vastly deepening our debt, is worth
   the added tax burden it will eventually impose upon our citizens.

   This result should be achieved as a natural o u t g r o d of demon-

March 3 . I n final meeting of the Space, Science, and Urban Life
        0-
   Conference a t Dunsmuir House, Oakland, Calif., NASA Admin-
   istrator James E. Webb said: â€œ . . . we must all concern our-
   selves with the progress and the promise of scientific research
   and technological development in this country, and the effects of
   this activity upon society. My own work on projects concerned
   with civic and urban problems, has left an indelible impression
   of their complexity and urgency . . . .
      â€œToday we are dealing not only with profound changes in the
   social and economic structure of the country and the world; we
   are dealing, as well, with an even more profound change in man%
   own conception of the boundaries and limitations of his hnbit-
   able environment and his understanding of the forces of the uqi-
   verse . . . Man is no longer rooted to terra fimm, either in the
   literal sense, or in his understanding of the powerful forces of
   the universe of which he is a minuscule part. Increasingly, he
   comprehends that the new understanding and knowledge which
   are being unleashed by science and technology will alter his
   existence in more ways, and more rapidly, than he can possibly
   foresee.. . .
      â€œMan has gained mobility, his horizons have broadened not
   only in the g v p h i c a l sense, but because he no longer feels
   bound by a family farm, or a traditional village industry . . . .
   A civilization whch can move with serious purpose to gear itself

 Testimony of Defense Secretary Robert S. McKamara before House

    Secretnry McNamara said : â€œA substantial amount of funds
     [for F Y 19641 is requested for DYN.\-SO.\R. I mention this
    only to say . . . that technology as it a plies to space advances
                                             f
    so rapidly that we must expect many cianges in programs be-
    fore they are completed. I personally believe that rather sub-
    stantial changes lie ahead of us in this DYNA-SOAR.
       â€œIsay this, in part, because of the GEMINI development. GEMINI
    is a satellite project carried on up to the resent time by NASA,
    on which has been spent to date about g300 million, and for
    which they will request $300 million in 1964, toward a total pro-
    gram cost of $800 million; it will provide a capsule capable of
    carrying two men into earth orbit . . . .
       â€œGEMINI is a competitive development with DYNA-SOAR in the
    sense that each of them are [sic] designed to provide low earth
    orbit manned flight with controlled re-entry. DYNA-BOAR does it
    one way, and with flexibility, and GEMINI another . . . .

      â€œ[The NASA-DOD Project Gemini joint planning committee] . . .
    will insure that the military requirement for near-earth orbit is
    properly taken account of in the GEMINI prpject.
      â€œWe donâ€™t have any clear military requirement, or any known
    military requirement, per se. But I think we do have a require-
    ment, for environmental testing and experimentation in near-
    earth orbit.
      â€œWe are very much interested, therefore,â€™in the Gemini project.
    When we become more familiar with it and understand its po-
    tential I suspect it will have a great influence on the future of
                ....
    DYNA-SOAR
      â€œI guess that we will find that GEMINI has a greater military
    potential for us, even though a rather ill-defined military po-
   tential, than does DYNA-SOAR, and, moreover, that it will be avail-
   able much sooner than DYNA-SOAR . . . .
       â€œI think the DYSA-SOAR project can work out satisfactorily.
   The real question is, what do vie have when we finish it. I t will
    cost to complete, in total, including funds spent to date, some-
   thing on the order of $800 million to a billion dollars. The ques-
   tion is, do we meet a rather ill-defined military requirement better
   by proceeding down that track, or do we meet it better b modify-
    ing GEMINI in some joint project with NASA . . . .â€˜, [Hearings

 The development and operation of the first plastic laser was re-
   ported by the Radio Corp. of America. The experimental device
   is made with a fiber of transparent material of the same type
   used in making many familiar clear plastics. Employing a newly
   discovered hysical effect, it produces coherent pulses of intense
               f:
   crimson lig t at the highest visible frequency yet known to have
   been attained by a laser. The unique laser mechanism that is
   employed may permit the development of plastic lasers that emit
   coherent light over the visible spectrum from infrared through
   ultraviolet. The way may now be opened for the use of stll;
   other materials that resist laser action when contained in inorganic
   crystals. Some of these materials may be capable of producing
   coherent light at yellow, green, blue, and other frequencies. (Data

 Dr. Albert J. Kelley, NASA Director of Electronics and Control,
   testified before House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™
   Subcommittee on Space Sciences and Advanced Research and
   Technology: â€œAS a result of our review and study on the im-
   plementation of electronics responsibilities for future space mis-
   sions, in our FY 64 Budget we are requesting Congressional ap-
   proval for initial funding of $5hf to establish a new Electronics
   Research Center to be located in the Greater Boston Area. Our
   long range plans call for an installation buildup over a period of
                       r
   six to seven years ielding a staff of approximately 2,000 person-
   nel, of whom 600- 00 viould be professionals, and a plant value of
   approximately $50M.
      â€œThe rate of Center growth will be gradual and represents an
   investment in the future of space flight, analogous to the invest-
   ment made in the older research centers many years ago which is
   paying off so handsomely today. This rate of growth together
   n-ith up-grading of Center personnel by continued graduate edu-
   cation after they are on-board is expected to allow us to meet our
   sta5ng requirements with little or no impact on scientific and
   engineering manpower as projected during this grovth period.
      â€œThe NASA considered many potential sites throughout the coun-
   try for location of the Electronics Research Center. On balance,
   the overall university-industrial strength and capability in elec-



               -
   tronics and guidance research in the Greater Boston Area resulted
   in its selection as the location for the Center. This area, noted
   for its past and current heary concentration on electronic re-
   search, both in industry and universities, provides a compatible,

      stimulating environment for growth of NASA capabilities in this
      important area of technology.
         â€œThe Center will have the principal function of conducting and
      directing research and component technique investigations in the
      related fields of communications, data processing, guidance, in-
      strumentation, and control. It will be staffed and equlpped to
      perform original work and to work closely with industries and
      universities with common interests. For example, component test
      facilities will be provided for evaluation of industrially developed
      experimental components. The Center will serve to focus the in-
      creasing NASA out-of-house efforts in the burgeoning area of
      electronic technology. Most important, it will provide a re-
      generative path for the early exploitation of advanced techniques
      of developments for space flight, whatever their source.â€

    to be ahead a t the end of this decade, and that is where I think we
   ought to be.â€™â€™
       Questioned about his reaction to General Eisenhowerâ€™s charge
    that the national budget could be reduced by billions of dollars
    and that enormous sums were being wasted in the space program
    (letter to Congressman Charles A. Halleck made public March
    29 ,President Kennedy said :
            . . The United States Congress almost unanimously made a
       â€™)L.
    decision that the United S a e would not continue to be second
                                 tts
    in space. We are second in space today because we started late.
    It requires a large sum of money. I donâ€™t think we should look
    with equanimity upon the prospect that we will be second all
    through the sixties and possibly the seventies. We have the
    potential not to be. I think having made the decision last year,
    that we should make a major effort to be first in space. I think
    we should continue to do so.
        â€œPresident Eisenhower-this is not a new position for him.
    H e has disagreed with this at least a year o r year and a half ago
    when the Congress took a different position. I t is the position
    I think he took from the time of Sputnik on. But it is a matter
    on which we disagree. It may be that there is waste in the space
    budget. If there is waste, then I think it ought to be cut by the
    Congress, and I am sure it will be. But if we are going to get
    into the question of whether we should reconcile ourselves to a
    slow ace in space, I donâ€™t think so.
         K
       â€œT is Administration has concentrated its attention since it
    came into office on strengthening our military. That is one of
    the reasons why you could not possibly put in the Gut which has
    been recommended, nine or ten billion dollars, without cutting the
    heart out of the military budget. The fact of the matter is when
    we came into office, we had 11 combat-ready divisions and we how
   have 16. We increased the scheduling on Polaris, nearly double
    per year. We increased the number of planes on the 15-minute
    alert from 33 per cent of our strategic air force to 50 per cent.
    I n a whole variety of ways-in the Navy we have added about 46
    vessels, and stren hened ourselves in defense and space . . . .7,

April 3: Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of National
   Aeronautics and Space Council, said in speech before American
    Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in New York City that
    launching of LUNIK rv was an initial step â€œin a very well orga-
   nized man-on-the-moon program.â€ He warned that U.S.S.R.
   would â€œemploy its growing space competence for military pur-
   poses if it finds such action is effective. We must be ready to
   handle such a threat.â€
       Dr. Welsh disputed former President Eisenhowerâ€™s recent
    charge that â€œenormous sums of moneyâ€ were being wasted in the

A@   3: Morris Teppr, NASA Director of Meteorological Systems,
   testified before House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™
   Subcommittee on Applications and Tracking and Data Acquisi-
   tion. He discussed the Tiros meteorological satellite system and
   described the Nimbus advanced meteorological satellite, first of
   which would be launched in 1963, and said :â€œEach one of these fire
   element~;--orientation,    coverage, direct local readout, lifetime and
  growth potential, represents a major advance over Tiros. Nim-
   bus, including all these, represents an extremely large step for-
   ward beyond the Tiros capgbility. The Nimbus technical diffi-
  culties of the past were associated with the development of these
  five elements. We now believe that our major difficulties are be-
  hind us. . . .â€
      He described the meteorological sounding rocket program, and
   said : â€œIn the large meteorological sounding rocket program, it is
   planned to fire approximately 45 per year. These will be dis-
  tributed at various latitudes to measure the atmospheric structure
   in the various climatic regions from the Arctic t o the Tropics.
      â€œThe small meteorolo cal sbunding rocket program is aimed

D. Brainerd Holmes, NASA Director of d n n e d Space Flight, dis-
  cussed the manned space flight program before Yale Chapter of
  Sigma Xi, New Haven, Conn., and said: â€œIn two centuries, the
  United States has grown from a small collection of settlements
  here along the Atlantic seaboard to a great nation of almost 200
  million people s read across a continent. We have dug canals,
  d a m m e d rivers, Euilt railroads, launched ships, constructed high-
  wa s, and flown aircraft. We have constructed buildings, bridges,
     B
  an a nationwide grid of electrical power. We have developed a
  qzttem of kk~stt,r;.,    q,+mjtz~ and diqtribiition by which our
  people are provided with food, clothing, automotive transporta-
  tion, and other necessities and conveniences in such volume that
  the United S a e has assumed an unprecedented position of
                   tts
  wealth and power in the world.
     â€œSome historians explain this growth in terms of challenge and
  response. Under this interpretation, which appeals to me, the
  frontier and external danger have provided stimuli for growth.
  Now, however, Kith the frontier gone and the external danger, we
  hope, decreasing, we are entering a new period of change. What
  will now spur us to further growth ?

 Dr. George L. Simpson, Jr., NASA Assistant Administrator for Tech-
   nology Utilization and Policy Planning testified before House
    Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ kubcommittee on Appli-
    cations and Tracking and Data Acquisition : â€œNASA is committed
     to a hard, driving effort to transfer the useful fruits of our re-
    search and development effort to the private sector of the economy
    in as quick and as useful a way as possible.
      â€œWe are committed, first, because the Space 14ct requires it.
    NASA is directed to â€˜Provide for the widest practicable and ap-
    propriate dissemination of information concerning its activities
    and the results thereof.â€™
      â€œWe are also committed because we are mindful that a large
    part of the Nationâ€™s R&D effort is occupied by the Federal agen-
    cies; and that it is essential that the maximum value be wrung
    out of this part of the total effort.
      â€œThe requirements for space exploration begin in the field of
    anatomy and run through virtually the whole gamut of scientific
    and technological interest, through new power sources to zero
    gravity. Further, those things which are made for space travel
    receive no compromises from that harsh environment. Which is
    to say that a very large part of the total space work is at the very
   leading edge of the state-of-the-art; and that in another large
   part of the state-of-the-artmust be extended.
      â€œIt is reasonable to think that an effort of such size, range and
   sophistication, extending over a number of years, cannot fail to
   have major scientific and economic consequences : consequences
    that begin a s scientific and technological advances and then are
    converted into new techniques of manufacture, new systems of
    organization, and new products and services. The space effort
   mill be, we think, altogether comparable in its effect on the Amer-
   ican economy to that of World War 1 . Our objective is to
                                                1
   maximize, to facilitate, to speed up this effect. . . .
      â€œWe are aware that past experience indicates severe problems
   in the transfer of government research and development efforts to
   private use. However, we feel that the Nationâ€™s well being re-
   quires a major effect to determine whether these problems can be
   solved.â€ (Testimony)

    lion we in the United States are spending on research and devel-

    non-military, non-space work. And of that $4 billion, only about
    $1.5 billion is aimed at increasing the productivity of our economy.

 USAF satellite (1962 Beta Kappa-1), launched Oct. 26, 1962,
    to study artificial radiation, had dimvered evidence that radi-
    ation from U.S. Starfish high-altitude nuclear test would last up
    to 10 years, Project Diredor Dr. Ludwig Katz of USAF Cambridge
    Research Laâ€™boratories disclosed. The previously unidentified
    satellite, called â€œSTARAD,â€ was built a t DOD request when it became
    apparent artificial radiation might be damaging orbiting sa,tel-
    lites, carried nine different instruments for measuring the arti-
    ficial radiation. USAF spokesmen said, in their opinion, data from
    this satellib were influential in Dr. James A. Van Allenâ€™s rever-
    sal of his previous position that the radiation would last only a
    year (see March 15). Dr. Katz said the satellite found there had
    been little decrease in artifical radiationâ€™s intensity since the
    satellite was launched. â€œThe decay of the belt is so small that
    a lifetime of five to ten yea& would not surprise me.â€ STARAD
    also detected increased radiation from Soviet high-altitude nu-
    clear explosions of Oct,. 28 and Nov. l. It transmitted until
    Jan. 18 when its batteries deteriorated. (AP, Wash. Sun. Star,

   Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, in Associated Press interview,
       was asked: â€œMr. Vice President, as chairman of the Space Ad-
      visory Council [i.e., National Aeronautics and Space Council],
      you were intimately concerned in drafting the 5.7-billion-dollar
       space budget. Former President Eisenhower says the budget is
      spongy, and there is no hurry about getting to the moon. I n
       view of this recent Russian shot [LUNIK IV], what is your
       reaction 2â€™â€™
           The Vice President replied : â€œThe Administration has sub-
       mitted to the Congress what we believe is a sane and responsible
       proposal to insure the maximum efficiency and effectiveness of our
       space program. I know of no reckless desire in any responsible
       quarter to get to the moon at all costs and without regard to the
       consequences to other vital aspects of our national
           â€œTheobjective of reaching the moon is one aspect o policy.

       space program which v-ill be of great benefit to our country, and
       I think to all mankind. It may be possible by appropriating
       more money to speed up slightly the attainment of that goal and,
       of course, we a11 know it would be mighty easy to slow that gpal
       down. Rut I donâ€™t think that either alternative would be helping
       our country. Gaining a short period of time would almost cer-
       tainly be at the expense of other crucial programs. Slowing
       down might bring us some one of these days face to face with the
       shocking knowledge that we had permanently assigned ourselves
       to second place.
           â€œSo, a11 in all, I think the Administration has submitted a pro-
       bâ€œnm which we can all embrace and both parties can fully sup-

April 15: Dr. Arthur R. Kantrowitz, Vice President of AVCO Corp.,
     interviewed in U.S. News & World Report, said the moon was â€œset
      up as the priority target in our space programâ€ because, at the time
      of the decision, â€œit was the most obvious goal . . . . But I think
      that, while it does provide us with a center for vigorous activity,
      it precluded other imaginative things that we might be doing, be-
                                                 .

                                                                      ..

      would give us a chance to learn to live and to work in space. It
      would give us a chance to achieve a larger vision of the potentiali-
      ties of space . . . . A laboratory like this would enlarge m n â€™ s
      horizons in an important way. . . .â€
         Dr. Kantrowitz said there was â€œcertainly a ossibility of going
      to the moon via a manned orbital station,â€ an that this might be

      approach in addition to LOR, he said : â€œIfwe had two approaches,
      I would be willing to bet that it would accelerate our moon pro-
      gram, because there is a chance that either of these approaches
      will run into serious difficulties. Having two baskets for our eggs
      would seem to me to be a much more reasonable thing. Note that
      before the expensive later phases are reached by either approach
      a choice may be necessitated for economic reasons.
         â€œFurthermore, we might find after weâ€™re dee er into the space
      program that there are more exciting things to E3 done than land-
      ing a man on the moon.â€ ( U S . News,4/15/63,64-66)

April 17: Dr. Donald E. Gault of NASA Ames Research Center told
    American Geo hysical Union that moon dust, from one to 10 tons
                    â€™
                    I
    a day, was fa ling on earth. Dr. Gault estimated that 54 per
    cent of dust sprayed off moon (by impact of meteoroids) enters
    solar orbit ; 40 per cent enters earth orbit ; 3 per cent impacts earth
    directly soon after leaving moon ; and 3 per cent hits earth after a
    month or more. He suggested methods of finding moon dust for
    analysis : launching rocket to collect sample particles from upper
    atmosphere; and obtaining samples of sea sediment in polar re-
    gions where, he said, layers of moon dust must have been deposit-
    ed and trapped. ( N Y T , 4/18/63; Wash. Post, 4/18/63)

 NASA Administrator James E. Webb said in address before Milwau-
   kee Press Club Gridiron Dinner :
       â€œFrom the results of the past five years of effort, it is apparent
    that, if we are to achieve mastery of space, we must add sub-
    stantially to our scientific knowledge and to our utilization of
    technology. The NASA program is moving forward on both of
    these fronts. Essentially, our efforts in the Gemini and A 0110
                                                                     .%

    tion, and the skills which will be nee ed to meet such future re-
    quirements in the space environment as our nation decides to
   undertake . . . .
       â€œAll of these skills are needed not only in the pursuit of peace-
    ful rewards for mankind from space exploration, but for the de-
    velopment of any space missions which may become necessary
    to our national defense, to insure that space will not be used as
   an unchallenged avenue of aggression a ainst us. As these skills
                                               Be
    increase, a growing close relationship tween the nationâ€™s best
   experts in the underlying technologies is utilized to make the best
   decisions on new operat ional systems, whether civilian or military.

April 19: Dr. Philip H. Abelson, editor of AAAS magazine Science,
       criticized in editorial the four justifications cited for manned lu-
       nar landing program: propaganda value of program had been
       â€œvastly overestimatedâ€ ;possibility of military applications seemed
       â€œremoteâ€; â€œtechnological falloutâ€ would recover â€œnot more than a
       small fraction of the cost of the moon programâ€; and scientific
       questions about the moon could be satisfied with unmanned, instru-
       mented probes. I f a scientist is not among the crewmen, â€œthe al-
       ternative of exploration by electronic gear becomes exceedingly at-
       tractive. The cost of unmanned lunar vehicles is on the order of 1
       percent of the cost of the manned variety ; unmanned vehicles ciwl
       be smaller and need not be returned. Most of the interesting ques-
       tions concerning the moon can be studied by electronic de-
       vices . . . . Unmanned exploration could provide the basis for
       realistic design of manned landing craft, thus decreasing the total
       costs and increasing the chances of success. A reexamination of
       priorities is in order.â€ (Science,4/19/63, in CRY6/11/63)

 Dr. R b r Jashow, Dimtor NASA Goddard Institute of Space
         oet
    Studies, s eaking at the American Society of Newspaper Editon,
    a t t e m p d t o explain the â€œscientific effortâ€ in the context of the
    entire space program :
       â€œI think, personally, that there is also a powerful general
    stimulus which comes from the need for developing new ideas and
    technolo â€˜e6 to operata in and master a new environment. One
              T
    must go ack to the explorations of the late 15th Century to find
    a parallel IB what we are about to Pritness in the next 30 to 50

    ened int&&t-%&-&&d            and an intellectual ferment which were
    the necessary foundations for the development of a scientific
    revolution.
       â€œThe ideas of a scientific revolution could not have flowered
    in a static society with fixed ideas of what could and could not be
    done. It took the explorations of the 15th and early 16th cen-
    turies to shake established notions enough to permit the birth of
    modern scientific thought. I n a subtle and deep sense, this is
    one of the reasons for the interest of the scientist in the explora-
    tionelementsofthespaceprogram . . . .
       â€œI think that the history of the last 100 years denionstrates
    that we need nat expect a very long wait before space research
    will feed back into everyday affairs and play a role in them.
       â€œIn the 19th century, the la was rather long. The Scottish
    physicist James Clerk Maxaely published a treatise on electro-
    magnetism in 1864, but not until 1901 did Marconi transmit the
    first wireless signal a c m the Atlantic.
       â€œMore recently, in 1932, Chadwick discovered the neutron in
    En land. Fermi set the first atomic pile critical at Stagg
    Fiefd in Chicago in 1942, only 10 years from the basic discovery
    to a very formidable application.
150          ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1983

       â€œStill more recently, BQrdeen and Brattain and Shockley at
   the Bell Labs discovered the transistor in 1948 and only six years
   later the first transistorized power amplifier appeared on the
   market . . . .
       â€œ. . . the exploration of the moon has a very special role to
   play, precisely for the reason that would make one think the
   moon is uninteresting scientifically-specifically because the moon
   is a relatively lifeless body. It has no atmosphere, no oceans,
   nothing to wear away the record of the history of the solar
   system, and of whatever has occurred to the surface of the moon
   since its birth.
       â€œOn the earth, record of even tremendous surface events dis-
   appear within 10 to 50 million years, a very short time compared
   to the age of the planet, and mountains form and are turned
   over. With the action of weather, everything changes and dis-
   appears as the millions of years go by. That is probably also
    true on Mars and Venus which resemble the earth in this respect.
    But the moon has no oceans, no atmosphere, no mountain-building
    activity that we can discern. For this reason, the moon is a
   kind of Rosetta Stone of the solar system from which we can
    read the past. That is wh it is so interesting to the scientist.
    He has the opportunity to i n d there the record of the early his-
    tory of the solar system.
       â€œTo the student of the origin of the earth, the moon is even
    more interesting scientifically than Mars or Venus.
       â€œ. . . if the moon and the planets mere formed out of gas and
    dust in the condensation that surrounded the primitive sun,
    then we can expect such condensation to accompany the birth of
    every star. There are one hundred billion stars in our galaxy
    alone. Nearly every one of them we expect to have a planetary
    system around it. Some small fraction of those planets will be
    at the right distances from their suns, from their stars, and of
    the right size to have conditions favorable to the development of
    physical life as we know it.
       â€œIf that is the case, it follows that life must be a relatively
    commonplace thing, physical life in the universe . . .
       â€œ. . . there is one small instrument on the Tiros which has not
    achieved as much attention as it deserves. The size of a quarter,
    it is a black disc which detects the infrared energy radiated from
    the top of the atmosphere. That is the energy which is reflected
    back into space from the earth. We can accurately estimate the
    energy coming to the earth from the sun and we can take the
    difference between the two and calculate the amount of energy
    remaining in the atmosphere.
       â€œThis energy deposited in the atmosphere constitutes the driv-
    ing force that generates weather activity. With the aid of satel-
    lites, for the first time we can measure the energy difference and
    hope to break through from the day-to-day forecasting, which
    depends on immediately preceding events, to the week-long or
    two-week forecasts.â€ (Text)

  Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara said in speech before
     American Society of Newspaper Editors: â€œ. . . if we were to
     draft every scientist and engineer in the country into weapons
     development work, we could still develop only a fraction of the
     systems that are proposed . . . . This process of choice must
     begin with a requirement for solid indications that a proposed
     system would really add something to our national security. . . .
        â€œDevelopment wsts alone on typical major weapons systems
     today average upward of $1 billion. Over a billion dollars was
     spent on the atomic airplane, which was little closer to being a

   useful weapon when we canceled it, shortly after taking office,
   than it had been half a dozen years earlier, Eighty million was
   spent on the Goose decoy missile, essentially a pilotless aircraft
   that the enemy would confuse with our B-52â€™s . . . .
       â€œThe RS-70 is an example of a weapon which, i t seems to me,
   fails to meet the basic requirement for a major systems develo -
                                                                        P
   ment: a solid indication that the weapon, if developed, wou d
   add significantly to our national security. It happens to be a
   particularly expensive weapon : to develop, procure, and operate
   a modest force of these planes would cost us a t least $10 billion.
   Yet considering the weapons we already have, or will have by the
   time the RS-70 could be operational, it is very hard to see how
   this weapon would add t our national security . . . .
                              o
        â€œAs weapons systems grow more complex, more expensive, and
   more difficult to maintain in a high state of military readiness, it
   is essential that we limit as far as possible the number of new
   systems that we bring into operation; for we want to be as sure
   as possible that we can depend on every system to operate when
    it is really needed. A basic fact of life is that under the chaotic
   conditions of combat you do not get anything like the efficiency
   of weapons systems that you get on a test range. Relative simplic-
    ity is a most desirable characteristic of a weapons system, or of
    a combination of systems . . . .â€ (Text, in CR, 4/24/63,

April 21 : Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner, Science Advisor to the President,
    said in speech before Federation of American Scientists in Wash-

   â€œThe challenge of space exploration and particularly of anding
   men on the moon represents the greatest challenge which has
    ever faced the human race. Even if there were no clear scientific

    this year. We are looking at it again in relationship to next
    yearâ€™s budget. We are also looking at it because of the concern
    that has been raised in the Congress and out of the Congress.
    I h a w seen nothing, however, that has changed my mind about
                                                        .

        â€œNow, some people say that me shoul take the money we
    are putting into spce and put i t into housing or education. We
    sent up a very extensive educational program. My judgment is
    that what would happen would be that they would cut the space
       rogram and you would not get additional funds for education.
    k e have enough resources, in my opinion, to do what needs to
    be done in the field, for example, of education, and to do what
    needs to be done in space.
        â€œNom, this program passed almost unanimously a year a 0.
                                                                      7
    What will happen, I predict, will be a desire perhaps? possib y,
    to cut it substantial1 ,and then, a year from now or six months
                          B
     from now, when the oviet Union has made another new, dramatic
    breakthrough, there will be a feeling of W h y didnâ€™t we do more.â€™
     I think our pro , m is soundly based. I strongly support it.
    I think it w o u l d c a mistake to cut it. I think time will prove,

      even though vie canâ€˜t SBB all the answers which we will find in
      space, that the overall expenditures have been wortkmhile. This
      country is a c o u n t 3 of great resources. This propam in many
      mays is going to stimulate science. I know there is a feeling
      that the scientists should be vi-orking on some other matter, but
      I think that this program-I am for it and I think it would be
      a mistake to arrest it.â€ (Transcript, Wash. Eve. ~ C t n r 4/25/63,

      Dr. Dryden said Soviet maneuvers in Legal Subcommittee of
    U.N. Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space were â€˜.â€˜a small
      cloud on the horizonâ€ threatening â€œthat this effort â€˜toward scien-
      tific cooperation may be terminated.â€ He suggested that some
      scientists in Soviet Academy were non-Communist Party members
      and were eager for international contacts and cooperation; they
      uyparently were allowed to discuss scientific and technical matters
      not involving politics. But possibility existed that â€œpolitical
      elementsâ€ might â€œshut offâ€ moves toward international coopera-
      tion-evidenced by Soviet â€œtendency to hint that scientific cooper-
       ation may not be so easy unless there is agreement on legal mat-

      of its evolution. We passed beyond the relatively simple satellites
      and probes which characterized our early years and are heavily en-
      gaged in the development of advanced spacecraft and launch
      vehicles to accomplish the more rewarding, but more difficult
      missions. I n doing so, we met with both dramatic successes as
      well as some temporary delays. I n general, however, the year
      was one of intense activity and excellent progress. . . .â€

  I n AIAA speech at Dallas on â€œSpace Policy and Space Management,â€
      Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of NASC. reviex-ed the
      national objectives in space :
          â€œFirst of all, there is an over-all policy objective, which the
      President has ex ressed as the determination of this country â€˜to
                      Ip
      become the Tor dâ€˜s leading space-faring nation.â€˜ I t is worth
      mentioning that this is a broad umbrella. . . . Suffice to say that
      the space program is not a one-project design nor a short-run
     episode. It is a growing, expanding, multi-project program,
      which I predict will become an increasingly significant part of
      our way of life. As important as it is, the moon project is not
      the whole space program; it is just one portion and one phase of
      an over-all moqram which has breadth through variety and depth
      f a r into the future.
          â€œA few features of this broad space y l i c ? ?re:
          â€œ1. I t s objectives are peaceful . . . t e distinction as to what
      is peaceful and what is not peaceful is a matter of intent and js
      not determined by what agency of t h e government engages in
     them . . .
160           ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 19 6 3

        â€œ2. Our policy asserts that space travel and space exploratia-
    are subject to international lw and that such activity should be
                                    a
    consistent with the provisions of the United Nations charter. . . .
        â€œ3. It is our policy to seek increased internationa.3 cooperation
    in, and mutually advantageous agreements for,. the orderly and
    open conduct of space and space related activities . . . .
        â€œ4. It is also our olicy that the concept and performance of
    our space responsibiyities shall be maintained and strengthened
    as a national program rather than a series of separate and unre-
    latedprojects. . . .
        â€œ5. There are inherent risks in space exploration, particularly
    in manned flight, and they must be recognized . . . .
        â€œ6. While we must continue to improve on state-of-the-art com-
    petences, it is essential that we strive just as hard to make so-called
    quantum jumps in technology and performnnce . . . .
        â€œ7. It is a significant element of policy that progress be the
    joint product of government and private enterprise. . . .
        â€œIn conclusion, the national space program is an essential and
    dynamic feature of our economy. It benefits the many rather than
    the feu-. It strengthens the nation, both at home and abroad. It
    looks forward rather than backward. It highlights the contribu-
    tions of the most able technologists and the most able managers
    and gives them an unprecedented peacetime opportunity to repay
    more fully the special bonus they have received by living in this
    great country.
        â€œWe a n afford the space program. We must afford it. We
     can be satisfied with nothing less than first place-to the moon,
    to the planets, and throughout the solar system.â€ (Text)
April 24 :Evidence suggesting gigantic explosion in space 100,000
    years ago was reported by Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein of Mt. Wilson
     and Mt. Palomar Observatories. Spectrographic study led Dr.
     Greenstein to conclusion that there are at least two â€œradio starsâ€
     or â€œexploding gas clouds in very distant galaxies at distances of 2
     billion and 4 billion light years respectively.â€ Gas of each cloud
     weighs up to 100 million times as much as the sun, and the objects
     are 100 times brighter than Milky Way Galaxy. Dr. Greenstein
     said important consequence of findings was that it showed pos-
     sibilit of d&ting such objects twice as far awa as previously
          t
     thoug t possible. Dr. Greenstein reported his zndings at Na-
     tional Academy of Sciences meeting in Washington. (AP, Wash.

 I n press interview at NAS, Dr. Martin Schwanchild countered scien-
     tific critics of the U.S. space program, and said: â€œI a m for it
     and I think it would be a mistake to arrest it.
        â€œThe moon project is the stirring spearhead of a movement
     under the wing of which man will do real exciting things. . . .
    We must do an enormous effort of sparkling and grand and
     wonderful things and out of them one little pearl will come. . . .
         â€œEnergy in one program will increase the push in all others. J
     hope art will blossom and pure science and philosophy. The
     first time you stop the present momentum you will not save
     money but you will stop the impetus for improving education in

       â€œThis year t e criticsâ€™ chorus is louder than ever and studded
    with many familiar faces ranging from ex-president Eisenho\yer,
    who still wishes the space age would dry up and blow away, to an
   esoteric wing of the scientific community which appears to be
    disturbed b the fact that non-scientist types, such as engineers
    and pilots, %ave crept into the space program and are running
    their portion of it with vigor and enthusiasm directed toward
    specific goals that some scientists regard as unseemly. . . .
       â€œThe scientific community has traditionally provided the most
    solid opposition to the manned space flight program, but there has
   been a steady rate of conversion from critics to supporters during
   the Mercury years. This has been helped by the fact that it has
   become obvious that NASA does not intend to neglect scientific ex-
   ploration because of the Apollo priority. As the NASA program
   has unfolded with the years, it has become apparent that consider-
    able scientific exploration by instrumented satellites and probes is
   a necessary preliminary to extending the parameters of manned
    space flight. I t is also evident that manned space flight itself
    will offer a greater opportunity for scientific exploration of the
    universe than could ever be possible using only remotely controlled
   instruments and data transmission . . . . There are a great many
    valid, vital reasons why this nation must continue to press its
    exploration of space at the maximum feasible pace.

     â€œâ€˜If we do not make these efforts me will not be first on the

Apmâ€™ZB: AEC Chairman Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, speaking at Centennial
   Charter Day Convocation, Univ. of Massachusetts, said : â€œIf we
   look back a number of centuries to the Middle Ages, we find that
   man and society in the Western World were dominated by rather
   static concepts. The individual was born into a world that was
   essentially unchanging by our standards. He was not very im-
   portant. Poverty, disease, toil, and natural calamities were
   simply an inevitable part of life. He accepted the proffered
   explanations of the world and the universe, and his curiosity was
   not encouraged. Man was a fearful and superstitious plaything
   of his environment. The concept that man might improve his
   lot was not widely considered. Nor were the tools at hand for
   such a task.
      â€œThe beginning of the changes in this outlook are generally
   identified with the Renaissance and the Reformation. The
     uestioning and inquisitive human spirit could not be stifled
               Men began to question old forms and beliefs-in reli-
   !orever.

            B
    the min was a slow one, and it is by no means complete. There
    were many landmarks, established by many brave men in all walks
    of life, on the route to liberation. An example was the overthrow,
    by the evidence produced by Copernicus and Galileo, of the dog-
    matic concept that the earth is the center of the universe. It is
    difficult for us today to estimate the impact, on a closed s stem
    of thought, of the knowledge that the earth and the other fanets

    revolve around the sun. I f such an important belief cou d fall,
    were not others vulnerable? While science was opening manâ€™s
    eyes to the truth of his surroundings, a change was 111 the making
    concernin the concept of &an himself. The themes of individual
    rights an3 freedom were being developed in the period of the
    enlightenment and the first crystallization of these revolutionary
    ideas was in the American Revolution-the first revolution of
    which I am to speak to you today. Beginning with the Declara-
    tion of Independence and culminating with the adoption of the
    Constitution, the place of the State mas confined to protecting the
    rights of the individual and becoming the instrument for manâ€™s
    self-government . . . .
       â€œThe freedom to embrace new ideas, the concept that men need
    not accept miserable conditions of life, and the hope inherent in
    science, unleashed as never before the economic energies of man.
    Our second revolution, the industrial revolution, and the rise of
    science and technology, saw a beginning of the realization of . . .
    a huge increase in industrial and agricultural production a t a cost
    of less total labor, the conquest of many diseases, the lengthening
    of life, the improvement of health . . . .
       â€œAs we now enter the early stages of the scientific revolution-
    our third revolution-the full flower of creative evolution is burst-
    ing upon us. Yetâ€™powerful as the forces of science and tech-
    n o l w have already demonstrated themselves to be, relatively
    speaking we are only beginning to feel their influence. Our
    Nation and the world are committed to an accelerating cycle of
    knowledge-gathering and knowledge-exploitation. We cannot
    visualize in detail the consequences for the future. We can, how-
    ever, clearly see that we can, if we have the wisdom, create an
    environment essentially of our own choosin . The scientificrevo-

    lution can provide for the essential needs o men around the globe.
    Our small world will grow smaller. A t the same time our per-
    spective will be broadened unimaginabl: by the exploration of
    space. We can only guess at the distant impact of this dynamism
    on man, his institutions, the content of thought and the quality
    of life. We can be sure, however, that successful adaptation to
    the changin environment can be achieved, in an atmosphere of
                 f
    freedom, on y through advancement of men generally to higher

    uniquely militmy . . . similar remarks would apply to machines
    and devices used in the air, on land and on m,.and space is no
    exception. . . . As a corollary to these observatlons, the totality
    of our military space efforts, assessed from a national rather than
    a departmental standpoint, greatly exceeds the efforts of the
    Department of Defense alone. Space systems and devices are not
    simply military o r non-military merely because they are developed

    modifiedâ€ while Jupiter missiles were being discarded as â€œgar-
    bage.â€ Gen. Gerrity replied that the reason was quantity rather
    than quality. that USAF had had more experience with Thor, and
    â€œWe have launch facilities for the Thor but do not have launch
    facilities for the Jupiter.â€ Rep. Flood pressed Gen. Gerrity on

    site was turned over to SAC at Malmstrom AFB, Mont. (DOD Re-
    lease 612-63)
  USAF fired Minuteman ICBM from underground silo at Vandenberg
    AFB ((with complete success,â€ fourth successful firing of Minute-
    man from West Coast in past four weeks. (DOD Release 616-63;
    UPI, Wash.Post, 5/1/63)
During April: NASA Manned Spacecraft Center issued requests for
     proposals for preliminary study contracts on (1) rotating manned
    space station to house 18 crewmen; (2) non-rotating, zero-grav-
     ity station to house 25-30 crewmen ; (3) reusable logistics vehicle.

  NASA Manned S acecraft Center completed eighth of series of drop
     tests on storal! le gliding parachute. (M&R, 4/22/63, 13)
  Dr. John V. Harrington of MIT Lincoln Laboratory was selected to
     direct new MIT space research center, to be completed in 1965.
     Dr. Harrington was also named professor in departments of elec-
     t,rical engineering and aeronautics and astronautics. (Boston

  Writing in Hypnosis Quarterly, Frank M. Frazitta said astronaut
      trained in self-hypnosis could alleviate pain and discomfort dur-
      ing space flights. I n event of air-conditioning unitâ€™s failure, self-
     hypnosis could be used to lessen astronautâ€™s perspiration rate or
     make him feel cooler or warmer. (M&R, 4/8/63, 21)
  NASA awarded four-month study contracts for Synchronous Mete-
     orological Satellite to Radio Corp. of America and Hughes Air-
     craft. RCA would study camera resolution requirements in syn-
     chronous-orbit weather satellite and ways to modify Tiros satel-
     lite launched into highly eccentric orbit (about 22,000 mi. apogee
     and 200-300-mi. perigee). Hughes would study way in which a
      Syncom communications satellite could be modified for installa-
      tion of weather satellite cameras. (M&R, 4/22/63, 10)
   Wind-tunnel studies to evaluate aerodynamic d r a i and jet engine
      mass air-flow characteristics with 3/10-scale mo el of free-flight
      lunar landing test vehicle were begun at NASA Langley Research
      Center. Model was built at NASA Flight Research Center. Data
       from Langley tests would be supplied to Bell Aerosystems Co.,
      building two full-scale lunar landing research vehicles under con-
       tract from Flight Research Center. (Av.Wk.,       4/22/63, 77)
   Preliminary results of the first lunar contact with the new Lincoln
      Laboratory high-resolution radartelescope were reported at the
       44th annual meeting of the American Geo hysical Union by Ver-
                                                  I:
       non L. Lynn. The report was jointly aut ored with M. D. Sohi-
       gian and E. A. Crocker, also of Lincoln Laboratory. Lynn said
       that the first radar reflections from the lunar surface obtained at
       a frequency of 35,000 mc., more than four times that of previous
       radar probes, su gest that the moonâ€™s surface is fairly rough

       with respect t o t e dimensions of the 8.6-mm. waves employed.
       I n addition to the advantage of being able to view a smaller area
       than previously possible, the new. radartelescope would provide
       data on the absorption and reflection characteristics of the lunar
                                                                       171

 RABD Corp. report on communications satellites estimated that world-
    wide revenues from international communications would reach
    $210 million by 1965, $350 million by 1970, and $620 million by
     1975. Large part of these revenues mould come from undersea
    cables. ( N P T , 4/24/63)
 F. J. Krieger, RAND Corp. specialist on Soviet astronautics, said in
    report for usm Project Rand that Soviet Cosmos satellites prob-
    ably are â€œpara-militaryâ€ spacecraft of two types: (1) recoverable
    vehicle as large as Vostok spacecraft and (2) 4,400-lb., non-re-
    coverable vehicle launched from another site and with different
     booster. Krieger also stated his belief that U.S.S.R. had six
     attempted probe launchings end in failure between August 25
     and January 4 caused by inability to get fourth stage out of park-
    in orbit. First three were attempted Venus robes; next two,

  Dr. Barry Commoner, Prof. of Plant Physiology at Washington
     Univ., St. Louis, said in speech before convention of National
     Science Teachers Association in Philadelphia that U.S. scientific
     research was becoming too â€œmission oriented.â€
        â€œIn 1962 about one-third of the total federal obligation for
     basic research-and federal funds are nom the major source of
     support for basic s c i e n c w a m e from a single agency, the National

   Aeronautics and Space Administration. I n a total federal budget
   of about $900 million for basic research, NASA was obligated to
   provide $350 million, while the National Science Foundation pro-
   vided under $90 million . . . .
       â€˜ W e are engaged in a spectacular balancing act. Education is
   supported by science, science by space, and space by the man on
   the moon . . . [The] policy of supporting education through
   science and science through space is dangerously unsound . . . . We
   should recognize this policy for what it is-a short-sighted, pinch-
    penny effort to buy a few selected fruits of the tree of knowled
                                                                      Tâ€™

    Panama, said:
       â€œThe Space Committee of the United Nations has failed to
    give due consideration and take appropriate action on the im-
    portant question of sovereignty and security as they become in-
    volved in the use of space.â€ (CR,    6/27/63, A4133-34)
 Dr. John R. Pierce, executive director of research and communica-
    tions principles/systems divisions of Bell Telephone Laboratories,
    said at ceremony dedicating John Crerar Library at Illinois In-
    stitute of Technology that use of computers for document re-
    trieval â€œwould smother the user under a flood of information and
    misinformation it would produce.â€ One of first men to suggest
    feasibility of communications satellites, Dr. Pierce acknowledged
    the value of computers for library indexin but added : â€œIf I have
                                               B

 The April issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, included
    an article by Dr. Robert E. Marshak, entitled â€œReexaminin
                                                                  f  the
    Soviet Scientific Challenge.â€ I n this article, Dr. Marshak, c air-
    man of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the Uni-
    versity of Rochester, pointed out that Soviet preeminence in space
     does not necessarily mean that the U.S.S.R. has â€œachieved a
    decisive scientific and technological supremacy.â€ Comparing the
    â€œclosedâ€ economic and political structure of Soviet Russia with
    its controlled educational system to the â€œopenâ€ society of the
    United States, he suggested that the Soviet system was geared
    to the more tangible results of applied science while the United
    States had made greater strides in pure science.
        â€œSoviet space triumphs are due to an early and precise delinea-
    tion of a major national goal in applied science and a most de-
    tailed and deliberate organization of the wherewithal to achieve it.
        â€œ. . . I believe that our [the United Statesâ€™] undoubted leader-
    ship in pure science will continue to be nurtured by the openness,
     freedom, and free enterprise spirit which characterize our society.
    Our accomplishments in pure science will provide a vast reservoir
                                                                     173

    of ideas for important achievements in applied science, and our in-
    nate good sense and good mill lead to a voluntary rational measure
    of coordination and control in those areas which are indispensable
    for the achievement of our national objectives in applied science.
    I believe that the Soviet methods of strict supervision and control
    will lead to numerous short-range breakthroughs in applied sci-
    ence but that the momentum will not be sustained unless there
    are also significant advances in their pure science. A great im-
    provement in the quality of these achievements will de end u
    their ability to full establish the conditions of scientiz free$omn
                         9
    which are essentia for highly creative work in pure science.
       â€œ. . . If the Soviet Government comes to realize-and I believe
    that the Russian scientists already do-that scientific and political
    freedom go hand in hand and that it is difficult to guarantee scien-
    tific freedom without a major liberalization of Soviet society in all
    its aspects, there is bound to be a great efflorescenceof pure s5ience
    in the Soviet Union. And if a large measure of political freedom
    is established in the Soviet Union, it is quite likely that we shall
   be sending our American astronauts together with their Russian
    counterparts on joint expeditions to the moon and other celestial
    objects beyond.â€ (CR,5/27/63,9036-38)
During April: Air Force launched an Atlas F with a Chrysler-built
    nose cone on a 5,000-mile flight from Cape Canaveral to the vicin-

 NASA submitted the following written answer to Smnte Cnmmittee

                             &
    by Senator Margaret        ase Smith on the contamination problem
    in space exploration :
       â€œPresent plans for lunar spacecraft are to use assembly tech-
    niques in clean rooms and under environmental conditions similar
    to surgical onerating facilities. These procedures will not make
    the spacecraft sterile but are expected to reduce the total popula-
    tion of viable organisms by orders of magnitude below otherwise
    expected quantitites. As stated earlier, the natural environment
    of the Moon is believed suitably hostile to the propagation of
    Earth-like organisms to such an extent that, any contamination
    will be contained in very local areas.â€ (Committee Hearings,

M a y I : Testifyin before House Subcommittee on Manned Space
     Flight, NASA %eputy Associate Administrator and Director of
     Manned Space Flight D. Brainerd Holmes said that â€œthe present
     Gemini is a different program than the one with which we
     started. It had two fundamental purposes originally which we
     have not given up and which we still consider to be of paramount
     importance-to gain experience in prolonged weightlessness and
     to gain experience in rendezvous before Apollo . . . .
        â€œHowever, as we developed the Gemini program, we found it
     was not wise to have only an updated Mercury spacecraft. W e .
     found as we developed the subsystems for Gemini that it was
     much wiser to incorporate technology known today-not some-
     thing that was early developmental technology of the past. This
     concept would lead us step by step toward Apollo, and we would
     reap tremendous benefits from it. I n addition . . . it became
     quite apparent to us that this would be a very useful Earth
     orbitalspacecraft . . . .
        â€œIn developing the Gemini subsystems, we find that they are
     better and more sophisticated than initially conceived and the
     spacecraft is much more sophisticated than anticipated. There-
     fore, the costs tend to be higher and the time scales longer . . . .
        â€œWe had planned to have the first manned Gemini flight the
     second flight, during the first quarter of 1964. Our present plan
     is that the first manned flight in the series would not be until
      the fourth quarter of 1964. Our current plan grew in part from
     the advisability of having more sophisticated subsystems, which
     required more time, and in part from a reorientation of the pro-
        am to include a second unmanned flight before the manned
     Ksht . . . .
         . . . the Titan I1 . . . has had some developmental problems
     over and above what we had anticipated. However, the problems
      are always encountered in a developmental program. I n our
     o inion it will be safer to use the Titan I1 for manned flights
     P
     i we have two structural missions. We will have more time to
     eliminate the developmental problems . . . .
        â€œWe are planning an unmanned flight at the end of this year
     and about the middle of next year. We plan to have a manned
     flight in the last quarter of 1964 . . . .â€ (Transcript)

May 6-9: Third National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space
     held in Chicago.
        NASA Administrator James E. Webb, in keynote address May 6,
     cited recommendation by Iowa Summer Study that one or more
     scientists be included in Project Apollo lunar flights: â€œTOthose
     who have the responsibility for success in reaching the moon, it
     has appeared that the nature of the Apollo effort requires the
     training of astronauts who have substantial experience as test
     pilots in high speed jet aircraft, and to the extent possible engi-
     neering training as well.
        â€œMeanwhile, it is apparent that the view of the scientists that
     trained scientific personnel should participate is valid. and that
     at the earliest appropriate stage in the program scientists will
     be included on Apollo missions. So far as we can now tell we are
     oblignted to utilize astronauts with the maximum of test-flight
     experience and highly conditioned reflexes on the first flight of
     the most difficult of all undertakings. Should training and ex-
     perience in intermediate flights indicate otherwise we will, of
     course, take this into consideration in determining the stage of
     development in manned space flight at which a scientist-astronaut
     will directly articipate.

      in 1962 has exceed six months and is sti77 rising because most of
      those intended for long life are still operating successfully.
          â€œOur progress with launch vehicles has been equally gratifying.
      I n 1962, 82% of all major NASA lnunchings were successful. This
      performance has been paced by the remarkable Thor-Delta which
      has successfully launched 16 out of 17 spacecraft. I n addition,
      the huge Saturn has scored 4 out of 4 perfect flights. During this
      time period, both the Thor-Delta and the Scout payloads were
      increased over 60% at no increase in their $2.5 million and $1
      million price tags. These dramatic increases in performance, life,
      and reliability of spacecraft and launch vehicles represent by
      f a r the most effective way to achieve economy in the space pro-

   1942 has in less than 20 years led us to concepts and hardware

   could not be generally anticipated at that time. As a result
   of that dramatic scientific effort, we have established major goals

   space. We are convinced that a substantial effort is justified by
   the otential performance advantages and the many applications
        R

May 6: Former Chairman of tho AEC (1946-50), David E. Lilienthal,
   suggested a comparison of the â€œpurple cliches about the space age,
   current successor to the atomic new worldâ€œ with the early years
   of the atomic age, in Stafford Little lecture at Princeton Univer-
   sity printed in-the Congressional Record: â€œIn the 1940â€™s it was
   reasonable to join in General Grovesâ€™ and Senator McMahonâ€™s
   view of the possibility of a â€˜new worldâ€™ that peaceful applications
   of atomic energy might bring. Responsible men spoke of atomic
   power so cheap it wouldnâ€™t pay to meter it. Most of us were less
   exuberant by far. Yet even those with a less euphoric outlook
   had ample grounds to believe that the expectations of the 1940â€™s
   and the early 1950â€™s should be given a hard try, and that such a  n
   effort had a good chance of paying . . . .
      â€œWhat then is the record? . . . For the wuntry a a whole,
                                                            s
   except where the costs of producing electricity from other s o u m

   the long-term nature of major research and development pro-
   grams have a duty to warn of the pitfalls involved in making
   frequent, drastic revisions in such propams unless it is demon-
   strated after thorough study that such changes are necessary.
   Such a course always results in excessive delays and increased costs.
   There is an efficient pace at which a program should proceed. To
   reduce this pace substantially or to pull out all stops and operate

   â€œtoday space communism versus space democracy goes deeper than
   the mere competition of dumping material into orbit or the plan-
   ning of landing men on the moon, or dreaming of traveling to the
   planets. It involves the very survival of our American way of
   life. The eyes of the world are upon the space race, and the
   Soviets using our own brand of Fifth Avenue public relations have
   gained a psychological advantage. Our national space objective
   is pre-eminence in space and not just landing a man on the moon.
   Although desirable and psychologically reassuring, the over-
   riding issue is not who put the first man in orbit or who will put
   the first man on the moon, but which nation has been able t o develop
   the overall research, technology, and manufacturing capability to
   not only explore but exploit space. . . .

 General R. A. Schriever (AFSC) said in address to seminar partici-

    ing scientific enterprise we have today is the exploration of space.
    There are several reasons why this new region is of great im-
    portance to us. First of all, it is an unknown and unexplored
    medium, which is certain to contain many surprises. Second, it
188           ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 19 6 3

     is a tempting region for a nation that is bent on aggression.
     Soviet leaders have shown a keen awareness of both the psychologi-
     cal and military aspects of space exploration. They have boasted
     repeatedly that they could use their space technology for aggres-
     sive purposes. We cannot afford to leave our space frontier
     unguarded.
           Space exploration is also important for another reason. It
     greatly stimulates the advance of science by serving as a natural
     focus for intensive research in virtually every area of science and
     technology . . . .
         â€œTodayâ€™s methods of taking scientific measurements are far more
     accurate than those of the past, and they are improving all the
     time. For example, a year and a half ago we wer3 able to measure

 NASA Deputy Associate Administrator and Director of Manned

   â€œThe nation has a pool of about 1,400,000 scientists and engineers,
   which is expected to grow tq 1,900,000 by 1970. At present, be-
   tween 250,000 and 300,000 of these are employed in the aerospace
   industry. NASA employs more than 9,200 of these on its own staff
   and, through contract, accounts for the employment of about
   32,800 others. Thus the space program occupies something over
   3% of the national pool of scientists and engineers. We expect
   that this proportion will rise gradually, to a little more than 674
   in 1968.
      â€œThere is no evidence that this growth of the manpower require-
   ments for space is interfering with consumer research and develop-
                                                                   191

   ment. Nevertheless, as a consumer of scientific and technical
   manpower, we feel a responsibility to do our part to maintain and
   increase the supply.
      â€œBecause of this responsibility, NASA is . . . providing about
   35 million dollars to universities for research projects, and 10
   million dollars have been granted for university facilities. Under

   as unfortunate. To begin with, in contrast to the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration, Columbus raised the
   funds for his epoch-making voyage at least partly from private
   sources. Far from setting out to discover America, moreover,
   the admiral and his financial backers merely sought to find a
   shorter-hence more profitableroute to the Indies ;their primary
   aim was to make money, not history. Finally, though Washington
   has chosen to i ore the inconvenient fact, the conquest of the

Muy 15-16: Successful MA-9 Project Mercury flight, longest U.S.
   manned space flight to date (22 orbits; 34 hrs. 20 min.) :
      Mercury spacecraft FAITH 7, with Astronaut Leroy Gordon
   Cooper (Maj., USAF) as pilot, lifted off Pad 14, Cape Canaveral,
   at 8:04 a.m. EST. Atlas launch vehicle placed spacecraft in ini-
   tial orbit of 166-mi, apogee, 100-mi. r i p , 88.7-min. period,

   scientific experiments. Because automatic control system (a*=)
   failed during 19th orbit, spacecraft was oriented manually d u r q
   22nd orbit, retrorockets were fired manually, and re-entry phase
   was conducted without acs. FAITH 7 landed two miles from
   U.S.S. Kearaarge near Midway Island in Pacific. Value of
   trained pilotâ€™s presence in spacecraft was underscored by success-
   ful mission achievement des ite acs failure.

   another historic â€œfirstâ€ with cabin coolant valve and fan turned
   off from orbit #5 until about two hours before re-entry, astronaut
   relying on space suit for cooling while cabin temperature stabilized
   at around 96â€ F; HF antenna tests, another â€œfirstâ€, involving

 Robert Hotz wrote in Aviation Week and Space Technology
    editorial :
       â€œIt is an inevitable historic trend that as new technology is
    transformed from the spectacular experimental stage to reliable
    operational use, peripheral public interest lags almost in pro-
    portion to the increase in technical significance. For example,
    the world press could write about little else for months after
    Charles Lindbergh made the first solo transatlantic aircraft flight
    from New York to Paris just 36 ears ago this month. Last year
                                     9
    more than two million people fo lowed his trail across the trans-
    atlantic airway-most of them in jet transports taking about
    one-fourth the time of Lindberghâ€™s flight. Yet only a few ob-
    scure statistical paragraphs in the daily press recorded this
    tremendously significant perspective on the trail Lindbergh
    blazed.
       â€œAnd so it is likely to be with manned space flight, as it passes
    from the experimental fli ht-test phase into reliable operational
    performance. . . . [MA-8 is less exciting than the first breath-
    less attempt of man simply to survive short-duration space flight.
    But it is the type of foundation on which future capability can be
    built solidly. . . .

      â€œThe purpose of H.R. 701 is to attempt to bring some order out
   of chaotic and conflicting Government patent policies to the end
   that a uniform practice as respects ownership of patents derived
    from Federal contracts, and grants, research, and otherwise, would
   be carried out by executive agencies.

       President Kennedy replied: â€œI think they feel that itâ€™s worth-
    while. I havenâ€™t discussed it with Mr. Webb. NASA should make
    the judgment and will make the judgment, and I would not inter-
    vene. But they do feel that a flight is useful and that the experi-
   ence of Major Cooper has indicated that the time between the
    last Gemini flight â€˜as scheduled-the Mercury flight and the new
    Gemini flight, which is a period of almost 18 months-they feel
    may represent a gap which could be filled very usefully by another
    Mercury flight.
       â€œThis will be a matter which I think theyâ€™re going to be talk-

   ate floor stated:
      â€œThe decision to try to land a man on the moon by 1970 does
   not constitute a crash program . . . . Failure to decide on a

   ting no deadline a t all. Work is done best-even y the technical
   community-which is not exempt from the laws of human na-
   t,ure-when a specific goal is set. An objective of landing on
   the moon in the 1960â€™s . . . permits us to work at a challenging
   pace; yet, does not absorb a greater percentage of the nationâ€™s
   resources than our country can afford. This is only one percent
   of the gross national product at current rate . . . .

              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS,

      â€œProject Apollo does not fit the description of a crash pm-
   gram: The wartime Manhattan project was a crash program.
   We used all the resources we could to develop the atomic bomb
   in the shortest period of time, regardless of cost. We maiii-
   tained duplicating operations over a 3-year period in the hope
   that one would work-and one did, in time to help win a war.
   Apollo is no such project. I f it were, we would not have had
   the controversy over whether earth-orbiting rendezvous, lunar-
   orbiting rendezvous, or a direct landing was the best way t o get
   a man to the moon. A crash project would have gone into opera-
   tional stages of all three alternatives to a moon landing . . . .
      â€œThe shorta e of scientific manpower has not been aggravated
                  f
   in a measurab e way by Apollo. Those critics who fear that it
   has, have not established their case. For example, in 1970, it is
   predicted that U.S. scientists arid engineers will total 1,995,000,
   of which only 114,â€™700 or less than 6 percent, will work for NASA
   and its contractors. It should be noted that a substantial or-

   tion of those are merely moving over from research and deve op-
   ment work on aeronautics and missiles . . . NASA is enlarging
    its efforts to increase the national supply of scientific and engi-
   neering personnel. Last fiscal year, the agency provided grad-
   uate science and engineering fellowships to 100 students at 10

   and technological base: â€œ. . . insofar as our national security i   s
   concerned, the development of this basic structure for space power,
   and the scientific knowledge and technical skill required to enable
   men safely to explore the moon is probably of greater consequence
   than the lunar landing itself . . . .
      â€œThe decision to try to land a man on the moon by 1970 does not
   constitute a crash program. The decision-making process does
   not allow forâ€™vacuums; failure to decide on a schedule for attempt-
   ing to reach the moon is equivalent to setting no deadline at all.
   Work is done best-even by the technical community-which is
   not exempt from the laws of human n a t u r e w h e n a specific goal
   is set. An objective of landing on the moon in the 1960â€™s waq
   chosen as the one that would permit us to work for a lunar landing
   in a rapid, yet efficient manner. This permits us to work at a chal-
   lenging pace; yet, does not absorb a greater percentage of the
   Nationâ€™s resources than our country can afford. This is only 1
    percent of the gross national product at current rate.

      â€œMr. President, there is ample room in the current debate on the
   space program for divergent views and criticism and for con-
   structive suggestions. But are we to believe that if we cancel the
   Project Apollo, the savings will be so translated into new hospitals,
   modern classrooms, and better diets for the ill nourished? . . . .
      â€œWe are not faced with an â€˜either-orâ€™ pro sition. We can af-
                                          success^
   ford to have an effective, logical, and           space program and
   we can afford these other efforts to improve well-being here on
   earth. Mr. President, we cannot afford not to go to the moon . . . .
      â€œAny slowdown in our Nationâ€™s space programs would certainly
   afford great. comfort to our enemies and spread dismay among our
   friends overseas. To slacken the space effort after having accepted
   publicly on a national basis the Soviet challenge would open us to
   accusations of lack of firmness and resolution regarding national
   goals. . . .

May 38: Eric Sevareid, in Washington Evening Star column titled â€œIf
   Columbus Had Never Sailed,â€ discussed the debate on landing
   men on the moon :
      â€œIt was two years ago this week end that President Kennedy
   sent his special message to the Congress in which he said that he
   himself believed we â€˜should go to the moon.â€™ It has taken two
   years to develop the beginnings of a national debate on the ques-
   tion, among Congressmen, scientists and editoriahsts.
      â€˜LI the beginnings of a debate because, on its public plane
          say
   at least, the argument has not yet come into its true focus. The
   true question is not whether we should try to land men on the
   moon-the nature of this political world as vel1 as the nature of
   menâ€™s curiosity and the unquenchable spirit of science make it
   inevitable that we try-but how we go about it . . . .
      â€œThis is only the beginning. Anyone has only t let out his

      â€˜Those who scold the worriers say that to cancel the moon
   voyage would be as if Ferdinand and Isabella had cancelled
   Columbusâ€™ voyage which opened the New World. They are more
   often right than they know. What is at stake are not only the
   new marvels to be found, but also the profound transfiguration
   of the source of the search.

    Flight Centerâ€™s Theoretical Div., asked whether lunar base, per-
    manent manned space station, or manned Mars exploration would
    â€œgive the greatest scientific return in the shortest possible time,â€
    replied: â€œA lunar base, very definitely. The moon will be more
    useful scientifically than Mars because it has no atmosphere, and
   because, being much closer, we can send back information and
    samples at a much higher rate. Compared with the space sta-
    tion, the moon has the advanoage of providing a large, stable plat-
    form with usable raw materials; in addition, the moon has a
    stratigraphic record of its history and of meâ€™tmritic material
                                                                    221

   which has accumulated on it. These dvantages are in a sense
   a one-way street. We can make many of the observations pro-
   posed for the space station from the moon as well, because the
   moon has essentially a s p environment. But we cannot examine
   the lunar rocks from a space station; we must get down on the

     eventually can be applied to whatever national purpose or need
     that may arise in the future. Gradually, the point that the
     manned lunar landing Apollo program is simply the best possible
     focal point for this effort in its present phase is emerging from
     the verbal pyrotechnics of the current debate. I t is becoming
     more readily apparent that Apollo is not just an â€˜over-Niagara-

     larly in the six- and 22-orbit flights of Cdr. Schirra and Maj.

   engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists who combine
   hi h talent and high training.
     â€˜For example, in 1950 we turned out 2,000 Ph.D.â€™s in these 3
   fields; in 1960, we graduated 3,000, an increase of 50 percent. But
   in 1970 we need a minimum of 7,500, an increase in the decade of
   150 percent . . . .
      â€œThe study conducted for the President [by Presidentâ€™s Science
   Advisory Committee] suggests that the manpower requirements
   of this decade can be met only if more students studying science
   and engineering . . . are encouraged to continue on to full-time
   graduate study.
      â€œThe major barrier to such advanced study is financial . . . .
      â€œAnother barrier is limited graduate facilities and fac-

  Project Mercury officially ended. Initiated in autumn of 1958,
     Mercury had achieved its goal of placing manned spacecraft in
     orbital flight around earth, investigating manâ€™s survival ability
      and performance capabilities in space, and recovering man and
      spacecraft. Mercury-Redstone suborbital flights paved the way
      toward ultimate goal, with Astronaut Alan B. Shepard becom-
      ing first U.S. man in space in FREEDOM 7 (May 5, 1961), followed
      by Astronaut Virgil I. Grissom in LIBERTY BELL 7 (July 21,1961).
      First U.S. manned orbital space flight was achieved with Mer-
      cury-Atlas MA-6 flight, Astronaut John H. Glenn in FRIENDSHIP
      7 (Feb. 20,1962). This three-orbit space flight was followed by :
      MA-7, three-orbit flight of Astronaut M. Scott Ca enter in

      and yet imaginative intelligence, and cooperation, nationally and
      internationally . . . .
         â€œThe choice of system . . . in turn is of importance to the

      stations? Do they furnish personnel? What about their own
      research and development? And in addition to the economics
      there is the political national interest and national pride in
      participation . . .
         â€œThe communication satellite has arrived of experimental age.
      It will be brought into being as a working system. The United
      States has no monopoly on its creation. There are others who
      are capable of doing it. There is strong worldwide interest. The
      corporation is beginning to tackle the formidable problems in
      earnest enthusiasm, and I may say in the spirit of the kind of
      dedication that accompanies a ioneering effort of responsibility.

    ter to historical Government opposition to monopoly in any field;
    ITLT believed that private enterprise should not abandon field to
    which it has made substantial contribution; and ITLT believed that
     ComSatCorp was established as â€œa private corporation and
    intended . . . to be a carrierâ€™s carrierâ€ rather than competition
    for carriers using its services. â€œThe real problem, as we see it,
    is rather to strengthen competition than abandon it . . . .

Jzlne 19: FAA Administrator Najeeb E. Halaby told AIAA meeting in

     is feasible.
        â€œSecond, it is an expensive aircraft to develop, but not fantas-
     tically so, and certainly not beyond the resources of the greatest
     industrialized nation in the world.
        â€œThird, there is a market for an American transport of perhaps
     200 to 250 first-round orders. I f we do not develop an American
     SST, then the entire market, which could be something like 400
     planes during perhaps a decade of first-round buying, will fall to
     our overseas competitors. Among the purchasers would be the
     airlines of the US., which would be forced to purchase planes
     produced overseas in order to remain competitive.
        â€œFourth, in the event that we did not proceed with SST develop-
     ment, the Nation would default its position of preeminence in in-

  Study of Soviet astronautics from 1957 through 1962 (RM3595-
     PR) by F. J. Krieger of the RAND Corp., under USAF contract, con-
     cluded that the Soviet space program is an integral part of the
     Soviet military program. Krieger listed four main categories of
     Soviet effort: (1) earth-orbiting man in space; (2) lunar scien-
     tific exploration ; (3) interplanetary exploration ;and (4) Cosmos
     earth satellites, paramilitary in nature.
        Cosmos satellites have come in two s i z e l a r g e ones similar to
     the Vostoks, launched from Tyuratam cosmodrome east of the
     Aral Sea, orbiting at around 65â€, and brought back to earth; and
     smaller ones launched with smaller rockets from Kapustin Yar
     cmmedrcae ncrth cf t h Csspian see, d i t - i n g Plt .bmt 490, and
    not recovered.
        Kreiger counted 10 Soviet attempts at interplanetary flight, of
     which 2 have been partially successful (one passing Venus, an-
     other Mars, but both with communications failure) and six have
     failed to get out of earth orbit. (M&R, 6/10/63,16)

J d y 3 : Addressing First World Conference on World Peace Through
     Law in Athens, NASA Communications Systems Director Leonard
     Jaffe described role of satellites in communications and said:
     â€œ. . . Today, approximately 300 telephone channels are available
     across the North Atlantic.
         â€œNotwithstanding these recent and radical improvements in
      trans-Atlantic telephone service, we can predict the need for still
      more channels. Every time communication channels have in-
      creased, they have been loaded to capacity almost a t o n e n e w
     means for communication have never caused the abandonment of
      the old ones. Durin 1960 there were more than three million
                                     f
      overseas telephone ca Is, and reliable estimates indicate a seven-
      fold increase in overseas calls during the next decade. Such an
      increase in t r a 5 c will overtax the current and planned under-
      sea cables, and high frequency radio facilities. And our current
      communication facilities have no capability for transmitting
      television. . . .
         â€œCommunications satellites should soon be providing a substan-
     tial increase in our capabilities for world-wide high quality com-
      mon carrier communications, a t least over those routes where the
      volume of tra5c exceeds resent or forecast capabilities, and is
                                         f
      also great enough to justi y the necessarily large investment in a
      communications satellite system. Eventually, we hope that com-
      munications satellite technology will be improved to the point
      where service can also be provided to areas not served by other
      means, either because of their isolation or because the t r a c
      volume does not justify an investment in more conventional
      communication Sn_eans.
        â€œThe objective of the United States in this area Fas voiced by
     President Kennedy in a public statement, not, too long ago, in
     which he said: â€˜There is no more important field at the present
     time thnn c93-TcEic%tiGEs, tlnd fce m n a t g g s p &e advantages

    tion and employment, and to new methods and matmals for the
    productive process.
       â€œ6. There will be substantial defense spin-offs, in addition to
    the political and economic benefits which also tend to deter ag-
    gression. For example, rendezvous technique, life-protective
    measures, control and guidance systems, improvement in rockets,
    etc.

July IO: NASA Administrator James E. Webb issued statement to
    â€™ T h e record shows that Congress has consistently taken
    the necessary action to support the space program, and I am con-
    fident that this Congress will continue this record. Although the
    report of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics is
    a major milestone on the road to approval of the 1964 NASA
270           ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 196 3

    Budget, it is still too early in the consideration of this budget by
    Congress to draw firm conclusions as to what the final result will
    be. The House subcommittees have given the NASA programs a
    most careful review, accumulating data from hearings which will
    total more than 4,000 pages of testimony. Their devotion and
    attention to details has been impressive but in my opinion the
    overall result of their actions is an ina&quate level of sup ort
                                                                    P
    f w a program that is urgently needed, has achieved a high eve1
    of success, and is now giving this nation the promise of early
    preeminence in all phases of space exploration and use. I n the
    areas reduced, NASA will present a strong case for restoration as
    the legislation proceeds to enactment.
       â€œAfter its many details were brought under close scrutiny and
    the possibility of postponement of many of these examined, the
    Committee has endorsed the program and the way it is being
    carried out but decided to defer approval until subsequent
    budgets in a number of important areas. My view is that the
    necessary resources should be authorized this year, rather than
    have important segments postponed with the consequent intro-
    duction of uncertainty at many levels in the government-industry-
    university team now engaged in this urgent national effort.
       â€œAt the reduced level of funding recommended, we will cer-
    tainly have to slow up or postpone a number of programs and
    direct a reduction in the scheduled level of effort in the plants of
    our contractors where 90% of the work of the space program is
    done. Unless an adequate level of support is restored, momentum
    already attained with great effort and difficulty will be lost and the
    stretch-out required will add to the final cost of the work required
    to carry out the program.â€ (Statement)

     information is not final. Their capacity is substantial; there
     is every evidence that they are carrying on a major campaign
     and diverting g m d y needed resources to their space effort. With
     that in mind, I think that we should continue. It may be that
     our assumption or the prediction . . . that they are not going to
     the moon might be wrong a year from now, and are we going to
     divert ourselves from our effort in an area where the Soviet,
     Union has a lead, is making every effort to maintain that lead,
     in an area which could affect our National security as well as great
     peaceful development? I think we ought to go right ahead with
     our own program and go to the moon before the end of this
     decade.
        â€œThe point of the matter always has been not only of our ex-
     citement or interest in being on the moon, but the capacity to
     dominate space, which would be demonstrated by a moon flight.
      [This] I believe, is essential to the United States as a leading
     free world power. That is why I am interested in it and that
     is why I think we should continue, and I would be not diverted
     by a newspaper story.â€
        Asked about the possibility of cooperating with U.S.S.R. in
     a joint lunar mission, he replied :
        â€œWe have said before to the Soviet Union that we would be very
     interested in cooperation. As a matter of fact, finally, after a
     good many weeks of discussion, an agreement was worked out on
     an exchange of information with regard to weather, but we have
     never been able to go into more detail. The kind of cooperative
     effort which would be required for the Soviet Union and the United
     States together to go to the moon would require a breaking down
     of a good many barriers of suspicion and distrust and hostility
     which exist between the communist world and ourselves.
        â€œThere is no evidence as yet that those barriers will come down,
     though quite obviously we rrould like to see them come down.
                   if the Soviet Union were an open society as we are
     that kin of cooperation could exist, and I would welcome it.
     obvious!?
     I donâ€™t see it as yet, unfortunately.â€ (Text. Wash. Post, 7/18/63)

      coordination in Project Gemini and space stations. Vice Presi-
      dent Lyndon B. Johnson, NASC Chairman, said after the meeting:
      â€œCoordination is a natural and effective enemy of du lica-
      tion . . . . I a m encouraged by the coordination already L i n g

  I n letter to Chairman Miller of House Committee on Science and
     Astronautics, NASA Administrator Webb expressed NASA views on
      H.R. 5171, bill to â€œauthorize the Administrator of the General

     the economic and scient purchase, lease, maintenance, operation,
      and utilization of electronic data processing equipment by Fed-
      eral departments and agencies.â€
         Mr. Webb wrote that the â€œscientific and technical use and man-
     agement of computers cannot be separated from the responsibility
     for conducting the national space program. The bill would
     necessarily have the effect of fragmenting and watering down that
     responsibility. Accordingly, I see no alternative but to recom-
     mend that NASA be exempted from the terms of the bill . . . .     ?7

             I
    U.S. NASA joined other scientists and astronomers in scientific
    studies during the eclipse, with emphasis on ionosphere and on
    sunâ€™s corona.
       At Churchill Research Range, USAF. o m facility located at Ft.
    Churchill, Can., six Nike-Apache sounding rockets equipped with
    instrumentsto measure electron density, electron temperature, and
    solar radiation in ultraviolet and x-ray regions were launched for
    NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; Aerobee 150 sounding rocket
    equipped with spectrophotometric instruments to measure abso-
    lute intensity of spectral features in ultraviolet region was
    launched for Johns Hopkins Univ. ; and Canadian Black Brant
    sounding rocket with instruments to measure variations in D and
    E layers of ionosphere was launched for USAF Cambridge Re-
    search Laboratories. GBFC and AFCRL scientists said preliminary

    results indicated collected data confirmed previous predictions of
    composition of the ionosphere.
       At White Sands Missile Range, GSFC project for eclipse was
    Aerobee 150 sounding rocket equipped with coronagraph to photo-
    graph sun's corona, ultraviolet spectrometer aimed at sun's center,
    and camera to photograph Lyman-Alpha rays.
       A t Wallops Station, o m project was measurement of electron
    and neutral particle temperatures in the ionosphere using instru-
    mented payload launched by Aerobee 300A sounding rocket to
    207-mi. altitude.
       At Pleasant Pond, Me., GSFC team photographed eclipse with
    specially made instrument for photographing stars and comets
    near the sun.
       DC-8 flying observatory flew north from Edmonton, Can., to
    meet eclipse at Great Slave Lake, following path of moon and
    flying above much of atmospheric-haze layer. Sponsored by

    and true toward the horizons we have for so long hoped to reach.
       â€œBut we should also recognize that favoring winds are rising at

    late. We moved too slowly at first.
       â€œBut the record shows now that where the Soviet Union has
    successfully launched 43 payloads into orbit, the United States
    has launched 144.

     including the very costly de-i-elopment of new aircraft. I n this
     respect, NASAâ€˜s  aeronautical activities differ from those in space
     where new vehicles are developed, constructed and operated. It
     is our belief that in general the development and construction of
     new aircraft should be the responsibility of the user since on1 .he

     can make the compromises necesrjwy to produce aircraft w ich
     can play their proper role in civilian or military applications.
     We believe this view to be consistent with the advanced state of
     aeronautical technology, the sophisticated aircraft industry which
     now exists and the nationâ€˜s use of commercial and military air-
     craft . . . .â€ (Text)

     orbit (140-mi. perigee, 22,548-mi. apogee). Five hrs. 33 min.
     after launching, apogee-kick motor onboard fired for 21 sec.,
     placing SYNCOM 11 in orbital path ranging from 22,300-mi. to
     22,548-mi. altitude and adjusting its speed to near-synchronous
     6,800 mph, Traveling in slightly lower than synchronous orbit
     and at less than synchronous speed, satellite began drifting east-
     ward at rate of 7.5â€ per day. Ground signals would attempt to
     reverse drifting so that satellite would attain synchronous posi-
     tion over Brazil.
        Communications tests duning SYNCOM 11â€™s ascent into orbit were
     successful, including reception and transmission of â€œThe Star
     Spangled Banner,â€ a voice messtge, and a teletype transmission.

  In televised speech to the Nation on the nuclear test-ban treaty,
     President Kennedy said: â€œThe treaty initialed yesterday . . .
     is a limited treaty which permits continued underground testing
     and prohibits only those tests that we ourselves can police. It
     requires no control posts, no on-site inspection and no international
     body.
        â€œWe should also understand that it has other limits as well.
     Any nation which signs the treaty will have an opportunity to
     withdraw if it finds that extraordinary events related to the sub-
     ject matter of the treaty have jeopardized its supreme interests;
     and no nationâ€™s right to self-defense will in any way be impaired.
     Nor does this treaty mean an end to the threat of nuclear war. It
     will not reduce nuclear stockpiles; it will not halt the production
     of nuclear weapons; it will not restrict their use in time of war.
        â€œNevertheless, this limited treaty will radically reduce the
     nuclear testing which would otherwise be conducted on both sides;
     it will prohibit the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet
     Union and all others who sign it from engaging in the atmos-
                                                                  285

     as good enough to make cheating in those environments a very
           business, indeed.

       â€œIt seems clear to me that manâ€™s newly won ability to leave the

       â€œThe need . . . is for our creative physicists to think of simple

    than $12 million in contracts to Houston area firms. I n addition,
    MSC attracted some 300 business representatives per month from

 Article by NASA scientists Dr. Homer E. Newel1 and Dr. Robert
    Jastrow in Atlantic MwnthJy inserted in Congressimd Record by
    Sen. Clinton P. Anderson, Chairman of Committee on Aeronau-
    tical and Space Sciences. Replying to scientists critical of pace
    set for landing men on the moon, the authors said :
       â€œThis question requires a further exploration of the motives
    underlying the U.S. space effort. I s it primarily a scientific pro-
    gram, or IS it motivated by a broader concern with the national
    interest? Looking back to the overwhelming support given the
    new space program by the Congress in 1961, it seems clear that this
    support was not tendered for scientific reasons primarily, but c-e
    from a deep-seated conviction that the expanded program will
    make an important contribution to our future strength and secu-
    rity. We believe that this is the reason why the people have sup-
    ported the enlarged space program. That brings us to the point
                                                                       r
    on which we take issue with some of our scientific collea a             ,
    who complain, â€˜The scientific exploration of the moon has een
    accorded a secondary priority in the lunar program.â€™ This remark
292           ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 19 63

    is based on the premise that science should have top priority in
    the space program. However, while science plays an important
    role in lunar exploration, it was never intended to be the primary
    objective of that project. The impetus of the lunar project is
    derived from its place in the long-range US. program for the
    exploration of the solar s stem. The heart of that program is man
                             9
    in space, the extension o manâ€™s control over his physical environ-
    ment. The science and technology of space flight are ancillary
    developments which support the main thrust of manned explora-
    tion, while a t the same time they bring valuable returns to our
    economy and our culture. The science which we do in space pro-
    vides the equivalent of the gold and spices recovered from earlier
    voyages of exploration. It is the return to the tax ayer for his in-
                                                      f
    vestment in his nationâ€™s future. But the driving orce of the pro-
        m is not in scientific research alone, valuable though that may
    C i n the long run. Thus, the pace of the program must be set,
    not by the measured patterns of scientific research, but by the
    need for a vigorous response to the national challenge . . . .â€

 I n Washington press conference, President Kennedy was asked

                   8
     large warhea s were detonated.â€ The President replied :
         â€œI donâ€™t think that the problem is solved by the explosion of
     a large megaton bomb. The problem is really one, as you know,
     of discrimination, of being able to prevent saturation, of having
     to protect many tar ets while the adversary can select a few . . . .
         â€œThe problem of develo ing a defense against a missile is
     beyond us and beyond the loviets technically, and I think many
     who work in it feel that perhaps it can never be successfully
     accomplished because the whole problem, a you know, is to have
                                                    s
     100 objects flying through the air at thousands of miles an hour
      [and] to be able to pick them out. And if you can do that there
     is an advantage, it still seems to me, to the offense because they can
     pour i 200, or 300.
             n
         â€œAnd therefore, the problem is not the size of the bomb but
     rather the problem of discrimination, the problem of selectivity,
     targetâ€™? and all the rest.
         â€œOn t os8 matters we can continue to work. But I must say
     those who work the longest are not particularly optimistic that
     a scientific breakthrough can be made . . . .â€ (Transcript,

    the other memâ€™brs of the committee would generally agree, that
    NASA deserves unqualified credit for Dhe manner in which it has

  Under Secretary of the Air Force Brockway McMillan said in letter
     to Sen. Clinton P. Anderson, Chairmm of Senate Committee on
    Aeronautical and Space Sciences :
        â€œOur assessment of the NASA programs in the light of your ques-
    tions has strengthened our conviction that the potential joint value
     of the NASA and Defense Department programs a n be more fully
     realized by closer collaboration in the early conceptual phases, to
     insure that the objectives of each agency are clearly recognized
     at each successive stage of program evolution. Our point is illus-
     trated by recant experience in developing experiments to be spon-
     sored by the Defense Department on the Gemini flights. Al-
     though the concerted joint effort, under the guidance of the
     Gemini program planning board, has been fruitful, it has be-
     come obvious that an earlier beginning of intensive collaboration
     might well have allowed greater results. Looking to the future,
     we hope to apply this lesson in the establishment of an orbital
     space station program. We view a sp<acestation as an essential
     preliminary to an operational space defense system, and as a
     valuable source of experience which will apply to NASA objectives.
      As this program is in the early conceptual phase, we think it
      possible to begin now to fully exploit its high potential to serve
                                                                       301

 Sir Bernard Lovell,. Director of Britainâ€™s Jodrell Bank Experimen-

   U.S.S.R. did not have a priority program for landing a man
   on the moon. The president of the Academy of Sciences
    [Mst.klav Keldysh] said that the Soviet Academy saw certain
   insuperable difficulties.
      â€œFirst, they did not a t the moment see how it was possible to
   protect any lunar voyages from the lethal effects of solar
       _. .
   radiation.
      â€œSecondly-and mixed up with t h i e i s that they did not think
   it was economically feasible with present techniques to land suf-
   ficient material on the moon to give the necessary protection
   against solar radiation and, at the same time, to enable a scientific
   program to be carried out and also to give the chap a reasonable
   chance of getting back to earth.
      â€œMost important of all, it seemed to me, is this: They have
   decided that with a soft landing of instruments on the moon they
   can extract nearly all the scientific information they want long
   before there would be a chance of getting a man there to do it . . . .
      â€œI ti312 the piT&*2czt of thc h s . d z E y quite h r k ! y th2.t I
   didnâ€™t agree with this sentiment, because I m a very firm believer
    in the importance of       tting a man on the moon not only for

   scientific reasons but a so because it is a great challenge facing

  I n address before National Editorial Associationâ€™s airplane division,
     inserted in Congressional Record by Rep. Garner E. Shriver
      (R.-IZans.) ,Boeing Co. president William M. Allen discussed pro-
      posed Government-industry program to develop supersonic trans-
      port aircraft in light of past progress in U.S. aircraft develop-
      ment. â€œThe first large expansion of passenger air transportation
      in 1931 employed trimotored airplanes each of which provided on
      the average, in actual operation, about 3,500 seat-miles of trans-
      portation per day. These airplanes cost $75,000 each. I n rapid
      jumps we have been able successively to increase the ca ability of
      the product until now, in the form of the 707 or the XC-8, it is
      delivering 400,000 seat-miles per day, which is 114 times the out-
      put of the 1931 trimotor. The jet airplane cost is $6 million, or
      80 times the cost of the trimotor.
         â€œEach step of progress which has made this change possible has
      been larger than the one before, and the jump to supersonic is by
      far the largest of all. The development cost has mounted accord-
      ingly . . . .â€ H e cited Boeingâ€™s financing in 1935 of prototype
      four-engine airplane which became the F ing Fortress, at cost of
                                                1
      $660,000, and Boeingâ€™s designin and builiing in 1952 of first U.S.
      jet transport, at cost of nearly $20 million. â€œA prototype super-
      sonic transport of the type regarded now as most practical is esti-
      mated to cost a possible $150 million . . . .
         â€œAlready Boeing has expended in the neighborhood of $15 mil-
      lion on supersonic transport study . . . . But the big costs are
      still ahead in supersonic prototype development . . . .
         â€œIt becomes evident that there is valid reason for the initiative
      which our Government is taking in developing means to finance
      the program and that the continued coo eration of Government,
      the manufacturing industry and the airyine industry is required
                                                                  307

      â€œIn carrying out this program and undertaking to meet the

   important, as Federal Aviation Agency Administrator N. E. Hal-

       Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Director of Space Sciences, said
   in introductory lecture :
       â€œThose who argue that we should dispense with the frills of
   science and s ace exploration, and concentrate on the necessities
    of military Ievelopment, forget that we canâ€™t really say what
   the military necessities in s ace will be. Our crystal ball is
    not that good, and it w o u l d L foolhardy to pretend that it is.
   We do not wish to develop a Maginot l i e in space, only to have
   it flanked by forces of greater flexibility. We need to develop
   in a broad way our space capability so that we shall have the
    ability to move in any direction required by future events to
    meet any threats along whatever lines may develop.
       â€œ. . . Out of this broad activity in space will come the ability
   of the United States to use space and to operate in space either
   as it may chose to do voluntarily or may find itself compelled
   to do in its own defense. The development of our ability to
    operate in s ace including manned space flight, gives to our
    country anotKer dimension in which to meet the challenges-both
    opportunities and threat-f      the future. We can do engineering
    in space, advance our science in a way that cannot be accomplished

      at the surface of the earth, and extend the range of practical
      applications for the benefit of man. And, if necessary, we can
      thwart the attempts of any enemy to use space against us.
          â€œIn this day and age we cannot afford to ignore this last point.
      I n our own self interest, and for the safety of our country, we
      cannot permit others to develop space capabilities that we cannot
      match, and that may, therefore, be used disastrously against us.
          â€œThis is a capability we must have to ensure our survival in
      the s ace age as the independent, self-determining nation that our
          P
       fore athers set us up to be, and that we have always insisted on
      bein
          â€œ&is is the capability that we shall have from the development
      of the ability to investigate scientifically with satellites and space
      probes, and from space applications, from the ability to perform
      manned space flight and manned space operations, from the vast
      complex of manufacturing and assembly plants, launchings com-
       plexes, tracking and telemetering facilities, and from the invalu-
       able experience that this initial stage in the space program will
       give us.
          â€œThis is the most significant point about the present era in
       space. This is the most important aspect of the present activity
       in space.
          â€œWe are now laying the groundwork for whatever role we may
       have to play in space in the future. We are ensuring that no
       one will ever be in a position to use space against us while we,
       helpless and frustrated through lack of the necessary space capa-
       bility, have to take what comes . . . .â€ (Text)

      Christopher
   Centerâ€™s Flight Operations Div., said Aug. 16 :
      â€œThe first U.S. manned spaceflight program [Project Mercury]
   was designed to (1) put a man into earth orbit,. (2) observe his
   reactions to the space environment, and (3) brmg him back to
   Earth safely at a point where he could be readily recovered. All
   of these objectives have been accomplished, and some have pro-
   duced more information than we expected to receive . . . .   ,,
      Discussing the stringent reliability requirements of manned
   space flight: â€œThe smallest mistake in a man-rated system can
   bring totally unexpected results. The unexpected is the rule
   in the unknown, and if man is going to live in the region beyond
   our atmosphere, he is going to live under new rules o r not at all.
   We hare been aware of these rules . . . but they have not been
   brought to our attention so vividly as they have in the manned
   flightprogram . . . .
      â€œThe manned space flight pro am has added greatly to our
                                     f
   knowledge of the universe aroun us and demonstrated that man
   has a proper role in exploring it. There are many unknowns that
   lie ahead in space, but we are reassured because we are confident
   in overcoming them by using manâ€™s capabilities to the full-
   est . . . . We now depend on man in the loop to back u p automa-
   tic systems rather than using automatic systems alone to insure
   that the mission is accomplished . . . . We have arrived at what
   we think is the proper mixture of that formula. Man is the decid-
   ing element ; but we cannot ignore the usefulness of the automatic
    syst~rns~â€
      Kraft told news conference that two engine problems were en-

   in address before Fourth International Electronic Circuit Pack-
   aging Symposium :
      â€œElectronics and its associated disciplines constitute the brain,
   nerves and senses of flight vehicles. It is estimated that about 40
   per cent of our booster costs, 70 per cent of our major spacecraft
   dollars, and 90 per cent of our tracking and data acquisition funds
   go into electronics. Unfortunately, in the same context approxi-
312          ASTRONAUTICS A N D AERONAUTICS, 1 9 6 3

   mately 90 per cent of our flight failures, not to mention flight
   delays, arise from electronic failures. Success in this area is
   obviously a major factor in over-all mission accomplishment since
   a dead or unintelligent vehicle is useless if it cannot measure data
   and send it back to earth . . . .

      â€œI urge that your Committee approve the total amount of

   if the full amount requested by the President were authorized
   and appropriated, we face in these funds and in the plants of
   the contractors a similar situation to that with our own Centers
   where they requested 2,000 more people than we were able to
                                                                 r0-
   approve under the budget restriction. I n our manned space
   gram we will be short between one hundred and two hun red
   million dollars out of the three billion dollars requested by the
   President. We are prepared to operate with a tight belt, we are
   prepared to operate without contingencies. However, I do want
   to point out to the Committee that we are still going to have a
   serious problem if we encounter any major difficulties in the form
   of a catastrophe on the launching ad or with a test station.

      â€œI should also like to say to t e Committee that after the

 Under questioning by the House Appropriations Subcommittee on
   Independent Offices, NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L.
   Dryden discussed the future space programs to follow the manned
   lunar landing program :
      â€œThere are three principal candidates for what might be called
   the next program. These are the manned orbital laboratory ; the
   further exploration of the moon; and finally, manâ€™s interplane-
   tary travel.
      â€œOne difficulty is the definition. MERCURY is a one-man orbital
   laboratory; GEMINI is a two-man orbital laboratory; APOLLO is a
   three-man orbital laboratory; and all will stay up for the dura-
   tion of the trip to the moon.
      â€œIf you are going further, you come to a question, Do you
    want something for 3 men, 6 men, 12 men, or 20 men?
      â€œOne of our problems is to define the requirements and both
   the Department of Defense and ourselves are making studies. We
   have agreed there should be only one project for the time being
   because this will be a 2 or 3 billion roject. We have agreed we
   will not proceed unilaterally. A $cision, of course, has to be
   made as to what, if anything, in the 1965 budget will be in this
   fieldoranother . . . .
      â€œAs to the further exploration of the moon, the definition is
    a very variable one. You might leave an astronaut out and,
   figuratively speaking, take camping equipment along for a few
                                                                              317

    days. Or you mi ht convert a whole lunar bug to a freight car-
                        f
    rier to extend the engtli of stay. You can go from that to a lunar
   base where you try to build a station, as in the Antarctic, that
    man can occupy for sometime . . . .
       â€œAll of these things run into the billions of dollars and cer-
    tainly Congress will be involved in it.
       â€œThere are people who favor one or another of these projects.
    I personally favor the manned orbital laboratory a being the
                                                          s
    next project. What we find on the Moon may change our minds
    on this, but from present knowledge I feel priority should go to
    a manned orbital laboratory. Some of this equipment has been
    in space for a period of a year or more. That is the length of a
    trip to Mars or Venus and back.
       â€˜As you know, the matter of making major decisions of this
    kind in Government is a complicated one and I cannot say a t this
    time when the hardware will be recommended by the administra-
    tion. One reason for saying the manned orbital laboratory has
    priority is the possible military application.â€ ( e r n s. . .

       â€œNot only have we learned more about the planet Mars through

    the vast reaches of space in between and beyond . . . . Weâ€™ve
    pursued unmanned space research down far more streets and
    alleys than have the Soviets.
       â€œFor the most part, our unmanned satellites are yielding knowl-
    edge that will assure success with manned flights into space i   n
    the future. For that reason, if no other, it is easy for the un-
    manned satellite program to be overlooked, its significance lost

 Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D.-Minn.) ,in Miwiles and Rockets interview,
    advocated selling space boosters to foreign countries. Noting
    Scout and Thor boosters already were available to European
    countries, he said Atlas also should be made available, under these
    conditions :
       â€œOne, that they pay for the vehicle-I donâ€™t think we should
                       ___
    give it away.
       â€œTwo, we would need to launch it for them. . . . Third. what-
    ever secâ€˜mies surround the launch vehicle and/or other devices,
    all of this would be handled by U.S. personnel . . . .
       â€œIn my opinion, other nations are not as interested in advancing
    scientific exploration as they are in embarking on programs to ad-
    vance their own economic position. And in this instance I say
    itâ€™s fine for us to cooperate by selling to them a booster or what-
    ever other paraphernalia they need.
       â€œAs these countries become more involved in space programs,
    it may be they will be desirous of buying Saturns or Centaurs.
    We donâ€™t necesssrily need to stop at Atlas. I think the whole high-
    thrust field of boosters is a tremendous market with great poten-
    tial.
       â€œ. . . we should do this through an agency of the U.S. govern-
    ment, probably through the Defense Department or NASA. What-
    ever profit might be involved does not go to NASA, does not go to
    mD-it goes to private industry, to those who make the Atlas or the
    Saturn or Centaur. This money gets back into the economy. It
    provides jobs. It stimulates the U.S.â€™s gross national product,
    causing our overall economy to grow and expand . . . .â€ (M&R.

B u p t 30: Reporting on experiments with mice in simulated space
     flights up to 90 days, Chicago researcher Bernard Miezkuc said at
     annual meeting of American Institute of Biological Sciences that
     resistance to infection is critically low on first, fourteenth, thir-
     tieth, and possibly sixtieth da s of flight. Apparently physical
     and psychological stress of ear$ flight could account for l o w e d
     resistance of the mice on first day, he said. Then, after temporary
     recovery, mice build up resistance during flight, with lapses occur-
     ring at periods of about two weeks, one month, and two months.

      â€œThese are the specific values of space exploration: the benefits

    our international position bv our acceptance of leadership in a
    historic human enterprise. The current discussion of these values
    of the space program has served the United States well in direct-
    ing its attention to questions of national purpose. But, however
    we may try to break the program down into its elements and to
    attempt a detailed balancing of debits and credits, the fact
    remains that the space effort is greater than the sum of its parts.
    It is a great adventure and a p a t enterprise, not only for the
    United States but for all humanity. W e have the power and

       â€œThe prime objective of . . . [the manned space flight] pro-
     gram is to land men on the moon before the end of the decade.
    The scope covered by the program is much broader than this.
     It is in fact the research, development and operation of a series
    of research manned spacecraft that will determine for us manâ€™s
    ability to operate in space. By focusing on the moon-landing
     we have set a goal that insures we develop all basic phases of
     the operation of manned spacecraft. I cannot emphasize this
     too strongly.
       â€œBy the time our three astronauts leave for the moon-landing
     we as a nation will have accumulated 2000 flight hours in earth
     orbit of manned craft. To indicate to you the significance of
     this number-we have a of now less than five flight hours of

    2000 hours we nil1 have orbited the earth some 1300 times. M n    e
    will have gone to and from craft in orbit. We will have ren-
    dezvoused and insmcted craft and transferred men and material
    between craft. We mill have maneuvered the craft both in re-
    gards to the attitude of the craft as has been done with Mercury
    and the Orbiting Solar ObservatoT and in regards to changes
    in the flight path as has been done with Mariner I and Syncoms.

     many technical fields that have affected, and will continue to
     affect every facet of life from our homes, to automobiles, to medi-
     cine, to buildings, to roads, and to education. History has shown

  I n a speech at the 1963Corporate Leadership Dinner, Detroit, Michi-

         â€œWithin the past quarter century alone, scientific research has
      more than doubled the inventory of human knowledge.
         â€œThe simple fact that we have shortened the distance between
      research and product development has itself altered and enriched
      American life immeasurably, and has created a potential for
      raising the living standards of people everywhere . . . .
         â€œHistorically, manâ€™s adaptation to new circumstances has pro-
      ceeded by fits and starts, aided by a generous allotment of time
      in which to accomplish massive transformation. But now science
      and teohnology are pumping a new form of quick-change fuel
      into the lifestream of civilization, and the time is past when we
      might count upon years of grace in which to alter concepts and
      methods to suit a differing environment. Today the un-
      precedented rate of change we experience-and can anticipate-
      is a fact unique in human experience, calling for more rapid and
      drastic accommodations than have ever before been required.â€

     Satellites (TIW) had been ejected into orbit from an unidentified
     orbiting satellite earlier in 1963. Twin satellites were second and
     third of series; first TRS was launched in 1962. Primary pur-
     pose of TRS experiments was investigation of radiation damage
     to spacecraft solar-power systems and evaluating methods of
     protecting the solar cells from Van Allen belt radiation. Valu-
     able data obtained by the five radiation-damage experiments in
     each satellite were transmitted back to earth and received by

     Of course there are difficult problems still in the way of serious
     Soviet-American cooperation on a manned space flight. But
     f,he financial, political and scientific advantages to both sides of a
     joining of forces in this area would be so great that, every oppor-
     tunity should be seized to explore this possibility with the So-

     followed up, not rebuffed out of hand . . . .â€ ( N Y T , 9/19/63,

September 20: Addressing U.N. General Assembly, President Ken-
    nedy listed results of U.S.-U.S.S.R. negotiations :
       â€œWe have, in recent years, agreed on a limited nuclear test-ban
    treaty, on an emergency communications link betwean our capi-
    tals, on a statement of principles for disarmament, on an 111-
    crease in cultural exchan e, on cooperation in outer space, on
                                f
    the peaceful exploration o the Antarctic, and on tempering last
    yearâ€™s crisis over Cuba . . . .
       â€œFinally, in a field where the United States and the Soviet
    Union have a special capacity-the field of sp-there           is room
    for new cooperation, for further joint efforts in the replation
    and exploration of space. I include among these possibilities
    a joint expedition to the moon.
       â€œSpace offers no roblem of sovereignty; by resolution of this
    Assembly, the mem rs of the United Nations have foresworn
                         ?le
    any claims to territorial rights in outer space or on celestial bodies,
    and declared that international law and the U.N. charter will
    apply. Why, therefore, should manâ€™s first flight to the moon be
    a matter of national competition?
       â€œWhy should the United States and the Soviet Union, in pre-
    paring for such expeditions, become involved in immense dupli-
    cations of research, construction and expenditure? Surely we
    should explore whether the scientists and astronauts of our two
    countries-indeed, of all the world-cannot work together in the
    conquest of space, sending some day in this decade to the moon,
    not the representatives of a single nation, but the representatives
    of all humanity.
      â€œAll these and other new steps toward peaceful coo ration
                                                                 Ell
    may be possible. Most of them will require on our part            con-
    sultation with our allies, for their interests are as much involved
    as our own, and we will never make an agreement at their expense.

    peaceful arenas, in ideas, in pro uction, and in service to all
   humanity.
      â€œThe contest will continue, the contest between those who en-
   vision a monolithic world and those who believe in diversity, but
   it should be a contest in leadership instead of destruction, a con-
   test in achievement instead of intimidation. Speaking for the
   United S a e of America, I welcome such a contest. For we

   pect. But the significance of this possibility is not limited to
    space; rather, it lies equally in the fact that, cooperation in space
    is one more step toward cooperation on Earth, toward the banish-
    ment, of t.he fear of the annihilation of life as we h o w it.
       â€œThe Presidentâ€™s st,atement received weight and conviction from
    the fact that the United States has a powerful space capability ;
    and from the fact that this Nation is well on its way to achieving
    preeminence in t,hisnew environment.
       â€œThis national strength in space represents a massive and pm-

    which has produced many specific achievements in space.

     whether we are devoting a disproportionate amount o our scien-

     has been pointed out that between 1954 and 1961 three-quarters
     of the increase in scientists and engineers engaged in research and
     development was absorbed by the defense and space programs,
     and that the programs on the drawing boards of these same
     agencies will require as many scientists during the next decade as
     all our institutions of higher learning will graduate during the
     same period . . . . How far and how long can this situation
        rogress without damaging our countryâ€™s capacity to maintain its
     [road leadership in research ?
         â€œThe Defense Department and the space agency have countered
     these concerns with predictions of spinoffs for the civilian economy
     from developments financed by them. So far, the evidence for this
     contention is unpersuasive. Whether or not the prophecy will
     come true does not alter the unrelenting fact that too little atten-

September 28: First birthday of ALOUE~TE I (â€œtopside sounderâ€)
      satellite, built by Canada and launched by NASA into orbit Sept. 28,
      1962. ALOUETTE was still functioning well and transmitting
      ionospheric data to 13 telemetry stations around the world.
          NASA launched four-stage Javelin (Argo D-4) rocket with
      instrumented payload to 645-mi. altitude from Wallops Station,
      in experiment to compare rocket-borne measurements of ion and
      electron temperatures and densities with similar data obtained
                        Measurements were taken by the rocket pa load
      by ALOUED.

      region and made its measurements. Data were telemetered to
      ground receiving stations and no recovery operation was involved.
      Flight was follow-on to similar experiment conducted July 2,
      results of which indicated close agreement in measurements.
      During the first year of operation, ALOUETTE I orbited the mrth
      4,981 tunes, executed 12,900 commands, and provided 2,060 hours
      of telemetry transmissions. (OSFC Historian; NASA Release 63-

  Discussing President Kennedyâ€™s proposal for U.S.-U.S.S.R. lunar
    cooperation, James J. Haggerty, Jr., said in Amy-Navy-Air
    Force Journal and Register article :
       â€œThe big question . . . is how far along are the Soviets in a
    moon program and which mode of approach did they select?
       â€œ. . . if the Soviets have adopted one of the approaches we
    have discarded, any cooperative arrangement would require pro-
    gram reorientation on the part of both nations of such magnitude
    that the only imaginable result is complete chaos, compounded
    of the basic difference in approach, the language barrier, differ-
    ing technological philosophies and engineering standards.
       â€œEven if the U.S.S.R. is already proceeding on the same lines
    as the U.S., i.e. the lunar orbit rendezvous mode, there are dif-
     ferent methods of attaining the same end and it is extremely un-
    likely that their systems development parallels our own in every
    detail.
       â€œIt is possible of course that the cooperative program consist of
                                                               r1

    astronauts, with the technical differences being resolved t rough Of
    the use of one spxecraft/launch vehicle combination without al-
    tering current developmental lines. But which one? Who gets the
     program management? One can see a political and technical
     argument over the â€˜Apollostokâ€™ (or should it be â€˜Vostapollo?â€™)
     which would leave the moon safe from assault for a t least a
    couple of decades.â€ (A-N-AF Journal & Reg., 9/28/63,14)

     was quoted in Washington Post. On June 18,1961, Dr. Howlett
    said :
       â€œWhy can we not boldly propose now a cooperative moon-shot,
    built and manned by Russian and American scientists? Why can
     we not send a capsule to the moon with a Russian and an Ameri-
     can inside it; and when they get there let them claim the moon-

  Address on Research and Development and the Federal Budget,
    by BOB Executive Assistant Director William D. Carey, inserted

    said :
       â€œ . . . Governmentâ€™s part in the research and development
    business has now reached the point where it commands attention
    because of its sheer size and propensity for growth. From here
    on, we will have to be more choosy in what we do, and better
     prepared to supply answers to questions about marginal costs
    and benefits. The budget this year for research and development
    is a husky $15 billion. Its growth potential dwarfs anything
    else in the budget. Someone has figured out that the doubling
    t h e for research and development as a fraction of national in-
     come is only 7 years, and that if this continued for 30 years
    research and development would rise to one-half of the national
    income.

         . . . it is my view that the difficulty here is . . one of
       U

    organizing research about research, of developing more adequate
    insi hts into cost-benefit relationships, of illuminating our value
        P
    ana ysis so that we can with greater confidence strike a balance
    between being first in high energy accelerators and beiig first
    in education and in decent living and job opportunity. I do not
    think that Government alone can reach these answers, but per-
    haps Government can-and indeed I believe it must-be as pro-
    portionately lavish in stimulating this kind of intellectual inquiry

                                                       f
    petences which have military as well as non-mi itary signifi-
    cance. These are competences which we would have been slow
    to develop were it not for this national moon objective. For
    example, rendezvous technique so basic to our moon project is
    essential to detecting and examining other spacecraft which may
    be hostile. Life protective measures are essential to a useful
    police force in space for maintaining the peace. Powerful rock-
    ets, reliability of space equipment, development of control and
    guidance systems, experience with manned spacecraft, etc., are
     all s in-offs from the lunar project, which help build our defense
        t
    capa ility.â€ (Text, Aerospace, Sept. 1963)
 Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of National Aero-
     nautics and Space Council, compared U.S. and U.S.S.R. space
     achievements in General%Zectric Forum:
        â€œ1. U.S. has put about 4 times as many payloads into earth
     orbit (approximately 130).
        â€œ2. U.S.S.R. has put substantially more weight into earth orbit
     with its smaller number of payloads.
        â€œ3. U.S. space applications in weather, communications, and
     navigation have been impressive. U.S.S.R. has potential in these
     fields but not accomplishments.
        â€œ4. Both nations have obtained remarkable amounts of scien-
     tific data, with no measurable advantage to either country.
                                                                     363

      â€œ5. U.S.S.R. has operational more powerful rockets than U.S.,
   while the U.S. is developing more powerful ones than any known
   to be in U.S.S.R.
      â€œ6. U.S.S.R. is ahead in manned space flight.
       â€œ7. Since the race began ratio of successe~ failures has been
                                                     to

October 1: Fifth anniversary of NASA. Ceremonies throughout the
    week included open house a t Wallops Station, Va., Sept. 29 and
    30; Fifth Anniversary Honor Awards Ceremony in Washington;
    Project Mercury Summary Report Conference at Manned S ace-
    craft Center, Houston, Tex., Oct. 3 and 4; and NASA Fifth Apnni-
    versary Banquet in Washington Oct. 5.
       I n its fifth year of spate operations (October 1,1962-October
    1,1963), NASA launched 12 orbital, deep space, and manned space
    flights, of which 10 were successful, 1 partially successful, and
    one unsuccessful. The X-15 rocket research aircraft set a new
    altitude record of 350,000 ft. and began its follow-on flights in-
    volving space research. The Mercury program added a 6-orbit
    flight and was concluded with a 22-orbit flight. Among other
    successful flights were four scientific satellites, two communica-
    tions satellites, the first and second synchronous-orbit communi-
    cations satellites, and another weather satellite. The fifth scien-
    tific lunar probe (RANQER v) was unsuccessful and led to a
    reworking of the remaining Ranger probes.
        Project Apollo flight testing was begun.
        I n its five years of space operations, NASA had launched a
    total of 68 orbital, deep space, and manned space flights, of
    which 39 were successful, 9 partially successful, apd 20 unsuc-
    cessful, for an overall average of 2% successes for every failure.
    The rate of improvement ranged from 1 success per failure in
     1958-59 and 1959-60, to 2 to 1 in 1960-61, to 5 to 1 in 1961-62,
         12 1 in 1962-63. (HHR-14)
  At NASA Fifth Anniversary Honor Awards Ceremony, held at
    Smithsonian Institution, 23 individuals were singled out for
    outstanding contributions to the civilian space program. Vice
     President Lyndon B. Johnson stated that U S . space policy was
    clear: â€œWith or without cooperation from any other country,
     we are going to the moon, and we are going to make that trip as
     soon as we can. . . . We would like to do this through inter-
     national cooperation. Leaders of both parties have sought co-
     operation under two administrations. The moon represents our
     major space goal for this decade, and if cooperation is possible
     we are willing to share this goal as well as others.â€
        NASA Administrator James E. Webb summarized the five years
     of space achievements and looked ahead: â€œFrom the first two
     IJnited States satellites, Explorer I and Vanguard I, launched
     early in 1958, we learned that the earth was slightly pear-shaped
     rather than being the sphere it had been thought to be. We
     also learned that the earth was surrounded by a zone of radia-
     tion, called the Van allen Belt after its discoverer Dr. James
     Van Allen.

      â€œIn addition t these first satellites of scientific signifimce,
                         o
    we have orbited highly successful weather and communication
    satellites, probed the area of Venus, put men into orbit and
    brought them safely back to earth, and sent thousands of sound-
    ing rockets into space to study the earthâ€™s environment. From
    these and other experiments installed in more than 100 satellites
    and deep space probes, we have succeeded in vastly expanding
    knowledge and understanding of our own planet earth and of
    the solar system of which it is a part . . . .
      â€˜â€˜hoking ahead throu h the remainder of this decade, we have
                            5
    set our sights on a tru y global weather satellite system, ad-
    vanced communications and navigation satellites, space observa-

    only one of them.â€ The five elements were (1) measures against
    war by accident or miscalculation; (2) measures against surprlse
    attack; (3) measures to curb the nuclear arms race; (4) exchange
    of information and persons; (5) U.S. consent to Gromykoâ€™s
    proposal to negotiats an agreement not to orbit large nuclear
    weapons

    broad exploration . . .,that we could even go step by step to the
    planning of a joint expedition.â€
       Speaking of the preparations for the Presidentâ€™s U.N. speech,
    Mr. Webb said: â€œ. . . I myself personally attended a meeting in
    the White House called by Mr. Arthur Schlesinger, perhaps a
    month ago, to consider things that the President might want to
    discuss at the United Nations. And I did myself on the day before
    Mr. Gromykoâ€™s speech have a long talk with the President, maybe
    35 or 40 minutes, about the whole space program in which we dis-
    cussed this. And I think I should say that he had his office phone
    me in St. Louis on Thursday afternoon after Mr. Gromyko made
                 h to read me the language that he then decided he would

    joint US.-V.S.S.R. lunar exploration for two reasons : â€œFirst,
    it would greatly reduce the costs of space exploration, releasing
    funds for important domestic programs, such as education, em-

    I1 missile to the man-rated Titan I1 booster for Gemini flights.
    System is intended to improve reliability by holding changes
    down to fewest possible and seeing that each of these contributes
    to overall reliability. Modifications that have been made include
    the necessary structural changes to accept the Gemini capsule,
    redundancy in certain key systems, and a malfunction detection
    system that would alert the flight crew to possible trouble.

 Thomas J. Watson,, Jr., chairman of the board of International
     Business Michines Co . speaking at the 46th annual meet-

     D.C., expressed concern about the current course of education.
     â€œThat concern has its origin just 6 years ago tomorrow. It was
     the day that the Soviet Union p u t Sputnik I in orbit. DO YOU
     remember the thoughts which flooded in on us that day?
     Thoughts of emba,rrassmeht-dismay-conmay-concern. . . . We could
     even try to say that SateIlites were just stunts, that Sputnik was
     a silly hunk of iron. But try as we would to whistle m the dark,

   Americans final1 had to reach the conclusion that the Russians
                    (I
    had outdistance us at least temporarily in the exploration of
    space, a pursuit which in our century might well become as im-
      ortant as the exploration of the oceans had been in the time of
    8olumbus and Magellan.â€
       Mr. Watson pointed out that the impact of sputnik on educa-
    tion â€œhas thrown the sciences and the humanities badly out of
   balance. . . . I n the fiscal year of 1961, of all Federal funds
    for basic research, the physical and biological sciences got 97
    percent.
       â€œThere are many traditional reasons for reemphasizing the
    humaniti-which        today are more important than ever.
       â€œIn the first place, a thorough grounding in the humanities
    is vital training for many leaders who can wisely manage people
    as well as sufficiently manage machines. This need exists in uni-
    versities, in public service, and in business.
       â€œSecondly, as our planet continues to shrink, we will more and
    more have to become citizens of the world. We must acquire a
    better understanding of the language, history, and culture of
    people of other lands. With present day mass-destruction weap-
    ons, this understanding is not just desirableitâ€™s vital.
       â€œFinally, the greater our skills in the humaniti-in      literature
    and the a r b t h e greater our capacity for a constructive use of
    leisure time, which is bound to increase a machines lift old bur-
                                                   s
    dens from menâ€™s shoulders and minds.
       â€œOn this sixth anniversary of the flight of sputnik, we can be
    sure of one thing; no second sputnik will come along to jolt us
    into action, and do for American education in the humanities
    what the first Sputnik did for American education in the sci-
    ences.â€ (CE, 11/12/63, A7010-A7012)
October 3: General Accounting Office (OAO) released report on NASAâ€™s
    Centaur booster which was sharply critical of both Government
    and contractor performance. Done a t the request of the House
    Committee on Science and Astronautics and submitted to them on
    March 29, 1963, but not released until Oct. 3, the report charged
    that p r management and program slippage had added $100
    million to the Oost of the program. The most significant charge
    in the report was that NASA and the contractor--General Dynam-
    ics/Astronautics-had in their possession in 1960 data from which
    could have been predicted the failure of the first test flight in 1962.
    The only immediate reply came from Julian Scheer, NASAâ€™s
    Deputy Assistant Administrator for Technology Utilization and
    Policy Planning: â€œOn Sept. 30, 1962, we moved the Centaur
    project from Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville to the
    Lewis Research Center because we knew we had problems. Still,
    we hope to fly Centaur by the end of this year.â€ (Wash. Post,

    statement on the large amount of faulty or careless manufacture
    and assembly of Mercury spacecraft. On the MA-9 backu

October 4: NASA Administrator James Webb spoke in Washington
    before the American Council on Education on the relationship of
    university activity to the space effort :
       â€œDr. Frederick Seitz, President of the National Academy of
    Sciences and head of the Department of Physics at the University
    of Illinois, noted recently that he could â€˜think of no aspect of
    university activity relating to science or technology which is not
    involved in a fundamental way in the space effortâ€™ . . . .
       â€œNASA [sponsors] a pre-doctoral training program with the
    ultimate objective of assisting in the production of 1,000 Ph. D.â€™s
    a year . . .
       â€œIthink I can say categorically that the universities with which
    NASA works are not becoming so reliant on federal research funds
    that it is interfering with their traditional role of undergraduate
    instruction. Although the ratio of graduate to undergraduate
    effort in many universities may be increasing, those with which
    we work are not reducing their undergraduate instruction role.
    I n fact, we know that all the major schools are most concerned
    about keeping up with the undergraduate demand.
       â€œIt is worth emphasizing that NASA is attempting to foster a
    broader base of competence in graduate research by awarding
    training grants to institutions rather than to individual scholars.
    Thus the university as an institution is given the opportunity to
    select its own candidates for instruction on its own campus.â€

October 5: On the eve of its fifth anniversary, NASA had run into a
    patch of â€œattack by partisan politicians, budget-cutters, those who
    want the milita to have a stronger rale in space, mismanage-
    ment sleuths, a x ersons confused by President Kennedyâ€™s bid
    for a joint U.S.-U.8.S.R. moon venture,â€ Howard Simons claimed
    in the Washington Post. He cited NASAâ€™s          budget troubles, with
    the $5.7 billion request already cut to a $5.3 billion authoriza-
    tion, another $200 million already cut by a House Appropriations
    Subcommittee, and even further cuts threatened in the full Com-
    mittee. NASA Administrator Webb, Simons said, had blamed
    budget problems on House Republicans, charging that they â€œ â€˜are
    following a political line trying to make the Presidentâ€™s pro-
    gram look foolish-â€˜Nuts,â€™ as Eisenhower called it. They have
    moved to the position that military activities in space are the
    only ones worthwhile.â€™ â€ Under mismanagement charges, Simons
    listed the CAO report on the Centaur program and the NASA charges
    of substandard workmanship by industry in the Mercury pro-
     gram, which in itself implied, according to Simons, a NASA admis-
     sion that it had not supervised industry effectively. (Wash.

     with an unmanned tanker spaceship; then another rocket would

  A change in the political climate in the last few months had NASA
     in trouble on its fifth anniversary, according to John Finney of
     the New York Tirnes: The trouble m l l y began when scientists
     began to question the validity of the manned lunar landing. â€œThe
     approach being urged by the scientific critics is a step-by-ste pro-
                                                                  B
     gram calling first for lunar investigation by instruments an then
     a manned program that would not divert resources from other
     fields of scientific research.â€ It m a s this apnroach that mas being
     followed until May 1961, when President Kennedy declared the
     high priority goal of a manned lunar landing in this decade.
        â€œIncreasingly, the attack on the space budget is taking on a par-
     tisan tinge, and the Administration in turn is reacting in a parti-
     san manner. It is significant, for example, that in the House Ap-
     propriations sdxommittee the votes to cut the space budget were
     strictly along partisan lines with the exception of Clarence Can-

    ministration request and $250 million less than previously author-
    ized by Congress. NASA Administrator James E. Webb said the
    1970 target date for landing a man on the moon could not be met
    unless Congress restored the $250 million cut, either by putting it
    back now or by approving a supplemental request in Jan. 1964.
    Furthermore, Webb said, the F Y 1965 budget would have to make
    up the â€œshortfallâ€ from the original Administration request for
    $5.7 billion.
       Rep. Clarence Cannon (D.-Mo.) ,Chairman of the Appropria-

    to $4.9 billion, that the Subcommittee on Independent Offices had
    wanted $5.3 billion, and that the $5.1 billion represented a com-

    Kennedyâ€™s proposal for a joint U.S.-U.S.S.R.   manned lunar land-

Early October: FAA Deputy Administrator Gordon M. Bain said that
             studies of a supersonic commercial air transport (SCAT)
     NASAâ€™s
     were not in m r d with FAA thinking-that            they derived too
     much from the B-70 work of some years ago and that they rec-
     ommended the technical desirability of a mach 3 aircraft, while
     FAA leaned toward a mach 2.5 aircraft as the one economically
     feasible for airline operation. (Au. WL., 10/14/63,38)
 Army announced $213,385,000 contract for continued development

October 8 : EXPLORER X N energetic particles satellite had definitely
     ceased useful transmission after almost 10 months of successful
     operation. Scientists at GSFC said trouble began in August, when
     the satelliteâ€™s transmitter failed to modulabtranslate instru-
     ment signals into telemetry code-properly. Intermittent modu-
     lation had occurred since then, but little useful data had been
     received. The satellite signal is still useful for position reference.
        EXPLORER xm, launched on October 2,1962, had an initial ellip-
     tical orbit of 61,500-mi. apogee and 173-mi. perigee. After 10
     months, gravitational influence of the sun and moon had changed
     the orbit to 60,220-mi. apogee and 1,280-mi. perigee, with a period
     of about 37 hours. Some 6,500 hours of data were received from
     the satellite. While not all the data had been analyzed, Dr. L.
     Cahill, Univ. of New Hampshire, said a number of new insights
     had already emerged, among them being : earthâ€˜s magnetosphere,
     as shown by mapping charged particles, flared an-ay from the
     earth in an ogival-pointed arch-shape ; confirmation that the
     vector magnetic field changes gently from a dipole confipratâ€™      ion
     to a radial field at increasing distance on the night side of the
     earth near the equatorial plane; and further evidence probably
     supporting EXPLORER VIâ€™S finding of a ring current flow on the
     night side of the earth. (NASA Release 63-223)

October 9: Nike-Apache sounding rocket launched at twilight from
    Wallops Station, Va., with 100-lb. payload to test theories of free
    radical formation in comets. At 95-mi. altitude a flame was pro-
    duced that left a faintly luminous cloud of combustion products
    visible from earth for 10 to 20 seconds. The cloud reflected sun-
    light in the way a comet does. Conducted by Lewis Research Cen-
    ter, the studies would test theories that natural comets are com-
    posed of the materials existing at the time of formation of the
    solar system. A second test was scheduled for the following night.

October 9: AEC memo, â€œElectromagnetic Effects on World Com-

    yield nuclear explosions on worldwide communications, amordmg
    to S p m e Business Daily. Data had been accumulated from high-
    altitude nuclear explosions in Project Argus, 1958, Operabon
    Hardtack, 1959, and Starfish Prime, July 9,1962. The rn m p d
    said that a 50-megaton blast a t 50-mi. altitude would black out
     communications within a radius of 2,500 miles for as long as a day.
    Such effects had been an area that opponents of the nuclear test-
    ban treaty had argued the U.S. had too little information about
    and that the knowledge was critical for ICBM penetration and anti-
    missile defense. (Space Bus. DaiZy, 10/9/63, 50, 51)

    is being built.
       â€œWe are inclined to agree with Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA
    Director ,James Webb and others that a major slash in space
    funds at this st e would not save money in the long run because
                   T
    a stretched-out unar landing program would come to an even

 House passed H.R. 8747, the Independent Offices Appropriations
    for FY 1964, which included the $5.1 billion for NASA recom-
    mended by the Appropriations Committee. Among the amend-
    ments accepted was one which would require Senate approval of
    any agreement that would use NASA funds in support of joint
    lunar exploration with Communist countries. Among amend-
    ments rejected were ones which would have (1) reduced NASA R&D
    funds by another $700 million and set limitations of $597,400,000
     on Project A p l l o and $124,400,000 on lunar and planetary ex-

    posed NASA e ectronics center ($3,990,000) ; and (3) reduced the
    amount for development of a supersonic transport aircraft from
    $60 million to $500,000.
        An involved debate preceded passage of the bill, most of it
    concerned with the NASA program. Rep. Clarence Cannon (D-
     Mo.), Chairman of the A propriations Committee, was one of
                                                           r

     the conviction that the roâ€™ect [manned lunar landing] must

        Rep. Albert Thomas (D.-Tex.) led the support of the NASA
     program, arguing that the NASA budget had already been cut $1.1
     billion from that ($6.2 billion) originally presented by NASA to
     the Bureau of the Budget. Another in support of the NASA ap-
     propriation was Rep. George W. Andrew (D-Ala.) ,who read into
     the record a letter from Dr. Wernher von Braun, Director of
     MSFC. Dr. von Braun argued that a program as big and complex
     and with such long lead times as the space program must have
     sustained, consistent support year after year. H e stated that of
     the various major expenditures-rockets, capsules, facilities, etc.-
     only the Lunar Excursion Module was being designed principally
     for the manned lunar landing. â€œAll other elements of these pro-
     grams create what we as a nation most urgently need independent
     of our lunar landing effort : A national manned spacefaring cap-
     ability, to sail the new ocean, as the President said.â€ (OR,

     and probably can go several hundred miles faster than it has been

October 11: Douglas Aircraft Go.graduated first class from on-the-job
    training program for potential executives. The six trainees, with
    no previous managerial experience, were assigned full time to
    departments completely different from their prior jobs with the
    company. Acting as staff assistants, they sat 111 on all policy con-
    ferences and later reviewed with the manager in private his rea-
    sons for the decisions made during the conference. W.E. Mas-
    chal, director of management systems for the Aircraft Division,
    said the program differed from other manager rotation plans â€œin
    its emphasis upon teaching potential managers the decision-
    making process from the excutive point of view.â€ (Space Bus.

    To say that the fuel cell is behind is not an adequate statement,
    but to say that problems have been encountered in solving the
    problems of enough on-board electrical energy to do the job
     would be an accurate statementâ€™-and the Titan I1 booster for
    the Gemini program--â€œWe must know what happens to men and
    equipment under a weightless condition for a week or two. We
     had hoped to get this information a t an earlier. date in making
    our plans for Apollo and future flight missions. We still will
     get it early enough to do the job within this decade.â€ (Ubell

  Editorial in the New Pork Timm: â€œThe House of Representatives,
     moved by sheer frustration and a kind of primitive emotionalism,
     occasionally acts in such a way as to undermine its reputation for
     rational lawmaking. The vote to prohibit the use of moon-
     project funds in any cooperative lunar attempt with the Soviet
     Union is a case in point. This restrictive proposition was pre-
     sented without advance notice, received virtual1 no debate on its
                                                     P

October 14.: The concensus of a number of visual experts consulted
     by NASA is that Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper did in fact see
     houses, roads, and vehicles from his orbiting FAITH 7 capsule. Dr.
     John A. Oâ€™Keefe of GSFC dismissed the theory that the atmosphere
     had acted as a magnifier of the objects. Maximum atmospheric
     magnification would be 1.00002, or a rise of 8.5 ft. Normal

 NASA Hq. had tentatively approved Project Luster, designed to cap-
    ture lunar dust that was in orbit around the earth, Missilea and
    Rockets reported. Proposed by Ames Research Center, the proj-
    ect is based on the assumption that meteorite impacts on the moon
    above a certain velocity should throw out more than the meteor-
    iteâ€™s own weight in dust. Some of this lunar dust should find
    its way into earth orbit. Ames would launch an Aerobee 150
    sounding rocket to attempt to trap some of the dust. (M&&

    from Sweden suggested that noctilucent, clouds found at that
    altitude could â€˜be ice-covered particles of meteoritic dust. The

October 16: Twin Vela Hotel satellites were launched by DOD from

    per reports. The two satellites, designed t o detect nuclear explo-
    sions m space to a distance of 100,000,000 mi., were launched mto
    an elliptical orbit of 57,000-mi. apogee, 230-mi. perigee. Some 18
    hours after launch, one of the two satellites received a signal from
    Vandenberg AFB which activated a rocket motor at apogee to kick
    the satellite into circular orbit a t 57,000 mi. On Oct. 19, the same
    was done for the second satellite, so that both would orbit at
    57,000 mi. but always be on opposite sides of the earth. Reports

 NASA officials testifying before a subcommittee of the Senate Appro-
   priations Committee offered sharply revised estimates on the cost
   of a manned lunar landing. Under questioning from senators,
   NASA Administrator James E. Webb agreed that NASA would
   spend much of the $20 billion normally stated as the cost of
   manned lunar exploration even if there were no program to land
   a man on the moon. When asked how much the manned lunar
   landing would cost over and above other s ace exploration, Mr.
                                                1
   Webb estimated less than $3 billion. NASA ssociate Administra-
   tor Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., estimated $2 billion; NASA Associ-
   ate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. Genrm Mueller
   estimated $1 billion. Mr. Webb and Dr. Seamans had included the
   cpst of unmanned investigation of the lunar surface,. while DT.
   Mueller was counting only the cost of the Lunar Excursion Module

 Dr. Edward Teller testified before the House Science and Astro-

   Congress devote its main effort to the development programs,
   where most of the Federal money is being spent, but leave the
   selection of basic research projects largely to the scientists be-
   c w this kind of research â€œdeals in the unexpected.â€ Asked to
     a
   comment on Dr. Wernher von Braunâ€™s statement of the value of
   the manned lunar landing, Dr. Teller answered: â€œVon Braun is
   a competent technician and a superb salesman. F a r be it from me

 FRC completed first phase of a program to determine how much visi-
   bility a pilot needs to fly an aircraft through all phases of flight.
   The problem is that the present standards of large glassed areas
   for ilot visibility would be virtually unaczeptable in vehicles

   capa le of orbital flight and re-entry. FRCâ€™S approach to the pro-
   blem was to configure a US. Army L 1 9 light aircraft with two
   wide-angle monocular telescopes mounted with their axis conver-
   gent to an angle of 55 toward the pilot. Exposing only four
                            O

October 22; President John F. Kennedy addressed the centennial
    meeting of the National Academy of Sciences in Washington:
     â€œ. . . it took the First World War to bring science into central
     contact with government policy, and it took the Second World
     War to make scientific counsel an indispensable function of
     government . . . .
       â€œEvery time you scientists make a major invention, we politi-
     cians have to invent a new institution to cope with it-and almost
     invariably, these days, it must be an international institution.
     I am not just thinkin of the fact that when you people figure
                            7
     out how to build a gobal satellite communication system, we
     have to figure out a global organization to manage it. I am
     thinking, as well, that scientific advance provided the rationale
     for the World Health Organization and the Food and Agricul-
     ture Organization-that splitting the atom leads not only to a
     nuclear arms race but to the establishment of the International
     Atomic Energy A ency-that the need for scientific exploration
                       3
     of Antarctica lea s to an international treaty providing free
     access to the area without regard to territorial claims-that the
     scientific possibility of a World Weather Watch requires the
     attention of the World Meteorological Organization-that           the
     exploration of internationd oceans leads to the establishment of
     an Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission . . . . The
     ocean, the atmosphere and outer space belong not to one nation
     or to one ideology but to all mankind.
        â€œ. . . ours is a century of scientific conquest and scientific tri-
     umph. I f scientific discovery has not been an unalloyed bless-
     ing, if it has conferred on mankind the power not only to create
                                                                397

   but also to annihilate, it has at the same time provided humanity
    with a supreme challenge and a supreme testing. I f the chal-
   lenge and the testing are too much for humanity, then we are
   all doomed. But my own faith is plain and clear. I believe
   that the power of science and the responsibility of science have
    offered mankind a new op ortunity not only for intellectual
    growth but for moral discipfine-not only for the acquisition of
   knowledge but for the strengthening of nerve and will.â€ (CR,

 NASA Administrator James E. Webb, speaking before the Michigan
     Industry-University Research Conference in Detroit, urged a
    steadily supported space program based on public understanding
     of the total purpose of the space effort : â€œIf this debate is to serve
     the best interests of the country, it is essential that every citizen
     of influence, whether editor, businessman, scientist, professor, gov-
     ernment official, or military man, study and analyze all the prin-
    cipal reasons for a well-balanced, fast-paced space effort. The
     scientist who thinks only of scientific results or the businessman
     who looks only for economic results or the writer who seeks only
     for the spectacular or controversial will not be making his most
     constructive contribution to the process of national decision mak-
     ing . . . .â€ (Text)
  NASA Administrator James E. Webb, speaking at Iowa Bankers
     Association 77th Annual Convention in Des Moines, said:
     â€œLet me list the principal reasons why our investment in manned
     space flight is sound :
        â€œ1. The current level of effort is vital if we are â€˜not to settle for
     second position in space . . . .
        â€œ2. Almost all our advances in space technology will add di-
     rectly or indirectly to our ability to deter aggression . . . .
        â€œ3. The scientific capital we shall acquire in the lunar program
     willlongservethenation . . . .
        â€œ4. The facilities we are building and the technology we are
     acquiring are tangible assets that will extend benefits to our chil-
     dren andgrandchildren . . . .

              ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS,

       Lâ€˜5. The dollars that are putting us into space are being spent
   righthereonearth . . . .
       â€œ6. We are clearly demonstrating to the world the ability and
    determination of our democratic society to organize whatever
    large-scale scientific and industrial effort is required to meet criti-
    cal national and international needs in time of peace as well a      s
   war. . . .
       â€œ7. To meet the stringent demands of the space environment
    . . . engineers are developin new materials . . . certain t pa
                                   a                                o

    off dividends, many of whic we cannot foresee, some of whic
    may beof revolutionarynatum . . . .
       â€œ8. We are rapidly building up a large pool of highly trained
    and creative scientists, engineers, and technicians . . . .
       â€œ9. We are currently devoting about one per cent of the coun-
    tryâ€™s income to the civilian space effort. If the inducammt to
    hard work and inspiration of participating directly or indirectly
    in spate exploration spurs our people to increase production of
    goods and services by only one per cent, the space program will
    pay for itself.
       â€œ10. Our swift progress has now brought us to the point where
    our space .power can be employed in peace-making as well as
          e-keeping.â€ (Text)

    iodide particles on Aug. 23 and 24,1963. The Aug. 23 seeding
    apparently missed the eye of the storm; winds continued to in-

    eye appeared to $  egenerate and reform in a wider and less violent

    physical scientists create needs for new institutions, as the Presi-
    dent noted, but the &cacy of these new institutions depends in
    large part u n utilizing the insights and knowledge of the social
    scientists.        the natural scientists themselves participate now
    more often in the shaping of public policy, they must feel in-
    creasingly the need for guidance from the economist, the Sociol-
    ogist, the political scientist, the hiistorian.

  X-15 No. 2, damaged in a landing accident in Nov. 1962, would â€™be
     returned to flight status early in 1964 with a number of improve-
     ments, NASA announced. Under a USAF contract with North
     American Aviation, Inc., the damaged X-15 was being modified to
     take another 13,500 lbs. of propellants. This would increase the
     rocket engine burning time from 86 sec. to 145 sec., which theo-
     retically would add some 1,300 mph to maximum speed capability.
     There were no plans for extending altitude capability because it
     would increase re-entry stresses. Other modifications included
     strengthened nose wheel and landing skids, dropable wing tanks,
     provision for installation of two 50-gal. liquid-hydrogen tanks in
     the fuselage midsection, to be used for advanced propulsion ex-
     periments, and windshield changes and ablative material additions
     to cope with the higher heat accompanying higher speed. (FRC

        â€œ & k e who say-as some are inclined to do--that     our purposes
     and the purposes of communism in space exploration are the
     same misread and misunderstand the history and meaning of our
     times. I n 1957 when the Soviets placed the first sputnik in orbit,
                                                                  405

    the Communist rulers of Russia refused to consider sharing the
    fruits of space research with other nations-refused to consider
    committing themselves to developing s ace for peaceful urposes
    alone. I n that same year, we of the 8nited States clear& stated
    our own national policy and purpose. We committed and ded-
    icated ourselves to sharing the fruits of space research with all
    mankind-and to the sole objective of developing the uses of space

    for our space program. It is significant that while we of the
    United States can and do propose joint endeavors for peaceful
    purposes, the Soviet both rejects our proposals and devotes itself
    to attempts to dissuade us from contrnumg on the programs we
    have established.
        â€œdmericaâ€™s commitment to the exploration of space for peace-
    ful purposes-and for the good of all mankind-is a f r com-im

   Aeronautics and Aerospace Engineering,noted that the next year
    would be interesting in that both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. were
    expected to come up with big increase in payload in orbit. The
   U.S. Saturn I was expected to put 10 tons in orbit. â€œAlso,I
    would not be a bit surprised if the U.S.S.R. launched a payload
    in the 40- to 50-ton class before this [next] year is over. The
    next step increase will be provided by the Saturn V in about 1967,
    when a 100-ton oapabiâ€™lity will be reached b the U.S. Many
    people hope that at least by that time the U.6.S.R. single-flight
    ca abilities will have been equalled or exceeded.â€
       gpace transportation w s developing fast, Koelle concluded :
                                a
    â€œWhile air transportation needed two generations to improve the
    efficiency of passenger transport by thrm orders of magnitude,
    we expect to improve the economy of Earth-to-orbit cargo trans-

 Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced the launching of POLET I at a
   Moscow reception in honor of Laotian Prince Souvanna Phouma:
   LL. . . the present spaceship is really new.    While the previous
   ships placed into orbit made flights mainly in the direction im-
   parted to them when they were launched from Earth, the space-
   craft that was lofted today is makin wide maneuvers in space,

   varying the orbital plane and altitu e.
       â€œThe fact that we have launched such a ship bears testimony
   that human ingenuity has reached a higher stage. Now man i         n
   space is no longer a prisoner of his ship. He controls it and guides
   its flight. The spacecraft has h m e ever more mpomve to
   man% will.â€

   a Russian and an American to the moon together, or better yet,
   a Russian man and an American w o r n ?
       â€œIf we could agree on further easing of tsnsion, not just-in

Nouember 3: Reviewing the U.S. manned lunar landing program,
   John Finney of the New York Times concluded that the race to
   the moon had always been a one-sided one, that there was no evi-
   dence that the Russians were building the large rocket that
                                                           x
   would be necessary for such a venture, that the were rather
   proceeding on a building-block program in space t at eventually
   would lead to a lunar landing, but not as a special, high-priority
   project. This, Finney said, was also the approach of the U.S.
   until May 1961. â€œThen, in the wake of the Bay of Pigs fiasco
   and the first Soviet manned space flight, the Kennedy ,Qdmin-
    istration ordered an abrupt change in course.â€™â€™ The original
   justification was that U.S. restige was a t stake. As time went
    on and budget resistance feveloped in Congress, the Adminis-
   tration argument shifted to one of attaininq â€œa position of pre-
    eminenceâ€ in space. Also the potential military benefits were
    emphasized more and more. Finally, the Presidentâ€™s proposal
    for the joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. manned lunar program seemed to
    undercut all preceding positions. To Mr. Finney, all this added
    up to the certainty that the U.S. would continue its program for
    a manned lunar landing â€œbut it will be pursued with less competi-
    tive zeal and at a more leisurely pace.â€ (Finney, N Y T , 11/3/63,

 Former President Dwi ht D. Eisenhower, interviewed on NBC-TV,

    Secretary of State John Foster Dulles also â€œbelieved just as I
    did that it was necessary to use it but he also believed that it
    would cause no real publicity if one of them should fall.â€ Both

Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, Commander of AFSC, s oke to the A=/
   ASD Vehicle Design and Propulsion Meeting in flayton, Ohio, on
  the future of amnautical systems. He predicted a continued
  need for aircraft in the weapons inventory, cited particular
   improvement potential in cargo aircraft and V/Stol. Another
   potential was that â€œfuture space operations may require the us8
   of recoverable boosters, for reasons of both efficienc and won-
                                                                  i
   omy. The first stage of such a booster system wou d probably
   be a recoverable air-breathing vehicle.â€
      Two technical areas of particular promise were identified as
   materials and propulsion. â€œWe have identified new materials
420           ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 19 0 3

   that are stronger, lighter, stiffer, and able to withstand higher
   temperatures. For example, new types of metallic fibers may be
   feasible in forming extremely strong, lightweight composite struc-
   tures. I f such projected applications prove to be practical, then
   we may !bein for a revolution in aircraft design and fabrication.
      â€œThere also appear to be high payoffs in the propulsion area.
   New technology should enable us to achieve better thrust-to-
   weight ratios and to move away from single point design.
      â€œ. . . Engineers are almost always overly optimistic about the
   next two or three yeam and unduly conservative in their estimates
   of a 15-year period or more. There were study groups in the
   1950â€™s that denied the practicality and feasibility of ICBMâ€™s,     the
   turbofan, and hypersonic flight. Ten years ago, so-called â€˜sound
   engineering judgmentâ€™ would not have forecast the present gen-
   eration of systems. The point is that â€˜engineering judgmentâ€™
   does not always give the best evaluation of long-range redictions.

 Utmost care would be taken in the assembly and checkout of the
    Mariner B spacecraft intended for a landing on Mars in 1966 so
    that the Mars lander would be completely free of earth microbes
    that might contaminate the Martian environment. Workers with
    even minor colds would be barred from the assembly area. The
     final assembly mould be subjected to a dry heat at 275Â°F for 24
    hours, then sealed into its special can and placed aboard the
    booster for launching. The special can would not open until the
    spacecraft was some 350 mi. from earth, considered to be the limit

    lead to other and broader agreements. The Dryden-Blagonravov

 Rocketdyne had completed test firings of the X-8 experimental
    engine, one of a series of experimental rocket engines being de-
    signed and tested by Rocketdyne for USAF'S Ballistic Systems Div.
    in a 'search for advanced propulsion techniques. The X-8 engine
    had tested the feasibility of using liquid hydrogen as coolant for
    the thrust chamber. The tests showed liquid hydrogen to be a
    remarkably good coolant. An X-12 engine would now be built to
    test the possibility of achieving an increase of four to five times
    the pressure in the thrust chamber using coolant. This would
    not alter thrust a t sea level but would give considerably increased
    thrust at altitude. (Av.Wk..11/11/63,99)
 A number of unofficial reports from Moscow have identified two key

    the men was Valentin P. Glushko, known as a rocket propulsion
    expert who worked with Friedrich Zander in the first Soviet
    research in liquid fuel rockets in the early 1930's. The other was
        a
     Ser ei P. Korolov, a mechanical engineer long associated with
    mec anics and structural problems of flight. Both are full a d -

    little better performance but only because it had undertaken a
    complete and expensive checkout of components. Government-

  Chemist S. Stephen Papell, of NASA's      Lewis Research Center, had
     applied for a patent on magnetic rocket fuel. Mr. Papell had
    found a means of magnetizing J P 4 and other liquid hydro-
    carbons by mixing small quantities of magnetic iron oxide with
    the liquids. Under weightlessness, an electromagnet located near
    the propellant pumps could pull the fuel into the pumps. Papell
    said much work remained to be done on the process before it could
                                                                 429

    tail of the comet moved in a four-day cycle, swinging about eight
    degrees t o each side of the radius vector each four days. The

November 1.2: Rep. Thomas M. Pelly (R.-Wash.) read into the
    Congressional Record an editorial from Life Magazine on
    priorities in the U.S. space program: â€œThe United States needs
    a reasoned and balanced space program that is more than a series
    of jumpy reflexes to things Khrushchev may or may not be doing.
    The first priority is not the moon. It is the conquest of inner
    space (up to 500 miles high), the true military high ground from
    which our world can be photographed, weather surveyed, perhaps
    atom policed. Beyond that lie vast challenges in the quest for
    knowledge of space, where the moon is only one way station. The
    challenges must be met, the United States must be a space-faring
    nation; but at a rate and in an order set by our own capacity and
    deliberation.â€ ( O R , 11/12/63, A7016)

    and to save industry time and money in competing for contracts.
    Under the new Two-Step Formal A4dvertisingsystem, companies
    would submit only technical proposals in the first stage, instead
    of both technical and business management aspects as was for-
    merly done. MSC would evaluate the technical proposals, notify

   manned lunar landing would not be worth the cost in money or

   which the American public has by no means faced.â€ That lives
   would be lost in the program was inevitable, he asserted, and
   would occur with the whole world watching.
       â€œWhat will happen when the tragedy occurs? The public is
   now in doubt on the program. They wdl be impatient as it pro-
   ceeds very slowly, with little of popular appeal to report. When
   a grim tragedy occurs they may throw the whole experiment out
   the window.
       â€œI have just as much enthusiasm as the next man for the parts
   of the program which make sense: the communications and
   weather satellites, for example. But the whole program has been
   blown u p to absurd dimensions. Instruments on the moon would
   gather scientific information, nearly as much as a man would,

    missiles can penetrate to their targets. In addition, the U.S.
    has Strategic Air Command bombers on air alert and over 500
    bombers on quick reaction ground alert. By comparison, the
    consensus is that today the Soviets could place about half as m n y
    bombers over North America on a first strike. The Soviets are
    estimated to have today only a fraction as many intercontinental

    to our Polaris force. The Soviets pose a very large threat against
    Europe, including hundreds of intermediate and medium-range
    ballistic missiles. This threat is today and will continue to be
    covered by the clear superiority of our strategic forces . . . .77

 N.WA had launched only six of a projected 40 major satellites and
    probes so far in 1963, according to Awiution Week. Though all
     six had been succssful, it was a big drop from the 18 launches in
     1962. N.\SA Associate Adniinistrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr.,
     attributed some of the drop in the launch rate to â€squaring away
     difficulties which existed before N . w . ~was created or which devel-

     of the Society of Aerospace Material and Process E n ineers in
     Seattle, Wash., D. J. Levy, a Lockheed Missiles and 8pace Co.
      scientist, discussed a revolutionary new gold-plating technique.
     His own invention, the technique makes it possible to goldplate
     by the simple method of spraying a gold solution from an ordi-
     nary spray gun, or from an aerosol bomb. Gold is the ideal sub-
      stance for thermal control because of its optical properties and
      resistance to tarnish. This new method, â€œLockspray-Gold,â€ has
      the advantage of great flexibility since there is no limit to the
      size of the object that can be coated. Levy also described how his
      gold-spray process was successfully used in the design of special
      lightweight furlable antennas developed by Lockheed for space
      vehicles. (Space News Roundup, 12/11/63,2)

     Science, criticized the mechanism for providing the President with
     scientific advice. I n a speech in Houston, he said: â€œToo much
     power is concentrated in a few overworked people, most of whom
     are of limited competence. The secrecy of the operations and the
     power invoked must inevitabl lead to corruption, either of the

      Adviser, Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner, Abelson charged he c6hasac-
      cumulated more visible and invisible power than any scientist
      in the peacetime history of this country . . .â€ and was a man who
      had failed â€œto engage in forward planningâ€ of science policy.

   son offered four main reasons for the new level of Congressional
   concern over the Federal investment in science and technology:
     1) cost consciousness ; (2) â€œthe belief among some Members that
      bngress has lost the ability to overseeeffectively the vast diffusion
   of R&D activities for which it appropriates fundsâ€; (3) â€œconcern
   that the procedures of Congress, in some respects, may not measure
   up to the demands of â€˜big scienceâ€™â€; and (4) â€œcriticism of the
   space program as â€˜moon madnessâ€™ and â€˜lunacyâ€™ gets lumped in
   with the criticism of heavy spending for research and develop-
   ment.â€ Sen. Anderson agreed with the aims of those who were
   cost conscious, although he noted that many MD programs that
   had been canceled as â€œfailuresâ€ had in fact left a valuable
   technological legacy to subsequent programs. He agreed that
   Congress needed more advice on technical matters, but doubted
   that the need would be solved by Congress hiring its own tech-
   nical staff; rather it needed more help from specially convened
      anels; more engineering advicesince the bulk of the Nationâ€™s

   of information such as Library of Congress, NAS, NSF; reports

       â€œThe spectacular success of applied research during the war
    led to a fallac entertained by many. I t is that any problem
                    $
    can be solved y gathering enough scientists and giving them
    enough money . . . . It is folly to thus proceed. The great scien-
    tific steps forward originate in the minds of gifted scientists,
    not in the minds of promoters. The best way to proceed is to
    be sure that really ins ired scientists have what they need to work
                          7
    with, and leave them a one.
        â€œIf the country pours enough money into research, it will inevi-
    tably support the trivial and the mediocre. The supply of scien-
    tific manpower is not unlimited.
        â€œIn any broad pro ram of research the keyword in regard to
                          %
     any one aspect of t e program is â€˜relevance.â€™ It is a ood
     word to have in mind in examining any research program. 8om-
     petent directors of research know what it means. Probably
     â€˜conducive to progress toward the main object of a [Tgramâ€™
     is as good a definition as any. Just finding out somet ing new
     is not by itself sufficient justification for research. It needs to
     mean something when we find it.
        â€œWhen scientific programs are judged by popular acclaim we
     inevitably have over-emphasis on the spectacular. That is just
     what we have today. The deeply important scientific advances
    moving today are not easy to understand. I f they were they
     would have been accomplished long ago. Outstanding scientific
     progress, which will most affect the lives and health of our chil-
     dren, is not grasped by many.â€
        Objecting to the practice of the government and the armed
     forces of utilizing universities in the management of secret pro-
     grams, Bush said :
        â€œIt should never be forgotten that the main task of the univer-
     sities is to educate men. The country will need skilled profes-
     sional men in the future as much as it will need new knowledge.

   the civilian space program â€œhas grown so big so fast that waste
    and inefficitmcy have been all too inevita!ble.â€ Althou h NASA
   was taking some steps to tighten controls, i t â€œcould a n f should

   that the U.S. had given more than it received in the agreements
   reached with the Soviet Union. Furthermore it contended that
   the Administration was usurping the powers of C o n r s s by
   entering into a series of space agreements without su mitting
    them to the Senate for its advice and consent. Finally, the report

November 2â€™ President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas,

     Tex. Within two hours of the Presidentâ€™s death, Vice President
     Lyndon B. Johnson had taken the oath as the 36th President of
     the U.S., aboard Air Force No. 1, the Presidential jet aircraft.
     ( N Y T , 11/24/63, E l )
 President Kennedy, speaking at a breakfast in Ft. Worth a few
     hours before his assassination, mentioned as part of the growing
     strength of the U.S. the development of the TFX aircraft :
         â€œThereâ€™s been a good deal of discussion about the long and
     hard-fought competition to win the TFX contract ; but very little
     discussion about what this plane will do.
         â€œIt will be the first operational aircraft ever produced that
     can literally spread its wings through the air. It will thus give
     us a single plane capable of carrying out missions of speed as well
     as distance; able to fly very far in one form, or very fast in
     another.
         â€œIt can take off from rug ed, short airstrips, enormously in-
     creasing the Air Forceâ€™s abzity to participate in limited wars.
     The same basic plane will serve the Navyâ€™s carriers, saving the
     taxpayers at least one billion dollars in costs if they built separate
                               and the Air Force.â€ ( N Y T , 11/24/63, 2)

  I n the speech whichyresident Kennedy was on his way through
     Dallas to deliver when he was assassinated, the President had
     prepared a statement on US. preparedness. After reviewing the
     improvements in military readiness, the President would have
     said :
         â€œI have spoken of strength largely in terms of the deterrence
      and resistance of aggression and attack. But, in todayâ€™s world,
      freedom can be lost without a shot being fired, by ballots as well
     as bullets. The success of our leadership is dependent upon re-
      s ect for our mission in the world as well as our missiles-on a
      f
     c ear recognition of the virtues of freedom a well as the evils of
                                                     s
     tyranny . . . .
         â€œAnd that is also why we have regained the initiative in the
     exploration of outer space-making an annual effort greater than
     the combined total of all space activities undertaken during the
      fifties-launching more than 130 vehicles into earth orbit-puttihg
      into actual operation valuable weather and communications satel-
     lites-and making it clear to all that the United States of Amer-
     ica has no intention of finishing second in space.
         â€œThis effort is expensive-but it pays its own way, for freedom
     and for America. For there is no longer any fear in the free
      world that a Communist lead in s ace will become a permanent
     assertion of supremacy and the fasis of military superiority.
      There is no longer any doubt about the strength and skill of Amer-
     ican science, American industry, American education and the
     American free enterprise system. I n short, our national space
      effort represents a great ain in, and a great resource of, our na-

 Reported in Aviation World (FZugwZt) that West Germany has a
    $25 million-budget to develop a series of 5 satellites to be built
    under NASAâ€™s   established quality control standards. The satellite
    would consist of three parts: the satellite capsule with a recovery
    unit, the sun mirror, the energy converter. The first satellite
    recovery capsule would descend with the aid of a parachute;
    later models would include a winged glider version. Telemetric
    transmissions and subsequent evaluation would commence as soon
     as the satellite enters an Earth orbit. The second satellite and
     the remainder of the series would be equipped with engines that
     will permit changes in the orbital parameters. On the second
     satellite small solid fuel rockets would be used, but the following
     models could be equipped with ion engines.
        The satelliteâ€™s mission would include research in the guidance
     and direction stabilization systems during the launching investi-
    gation of the orbital rendezvous problems, as well as a study of the
     radiation belts. I n the case of the fifth satellite, the ion engines
     could be replaced with nuclear-powered engines to permit con-
     tinuous orbital changes and accelerate to an escape velocity.

D e c e d e r S: Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D.-N.M.), Chairman of the
     Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, an-
     nounced that revised testimony refuted the earlier contention that
     25 per cent of U.S. scientific manpower would be working on space
     programs by 1970: â€œI challenged the accuracy of that forecast.
     The next day the Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Com-
     mittee began hearings on NABAâ€™S relations with universities . . . .
         â€œThe best estimatw are that 6 or 7 per cent-at most 10 per

     financially austere feasibility study, in Competition with high-

       Addressing the Ill-nation Committee, U.S. Ambassador Adlai
   Stevenson said President Johnson instructed him to reaffirm the
    proposal for U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in exploration of the
   moon that President Kennedy had offered last September. But,
   Stevenson continued, â€œIf giant steps cannot be taken at once, we
   hope that shorter ones can. We believe there are areas of work,
   short of integrating the two national prorgams, from which all
    could benefit. We should explore the opportunities for prac-
   tical cooperation, beginning with small steps and hopefully lead-
   in to larger ones.â€
      ttressing that U.S. manned lunar program was only one part
    of the s ace program and that no more than 10 percent of the
   total U.g. space expenditure went directly for the lunar flight,
    he added : (â€˜Let me make clear that exploration of the moon is not
    a stunt, distinct from the outer-space program as a whole; nor
    is it, the exclusive concern of only two natâ€™
                                                ions.
       â€œOur policy of engaging in mutually beneficial and mutually
    supporting cooperation in outer space-with the Soviet Union ;\s
    with all nations-does not begin or end with a manned moon
    landing. There is plenty of work yet to come before that-and
    there will be even more afterward.â€ (Teltsch, N Y T , 12/3/63,

 President Johnsonâ€™s active leadership in space program since early
    1958 was reviewed in Mi8sile.v and Rockets by Hal Taylor, who
    predicted the new President would give the space program even
    greater support than did President Kennedy. Added support
    could mean growth of military space projects, Taylor said, pos-
    sibly including assignment of manned space station development
    to USAF. But FY 1965 budget e i m a t e s would be virtually

        â€œIt is logical that aggressive elements in the Soviet Union may
   hope to enter a new period of forward thrust by some startling
   breakthrough in space technology. The only may ve can make
   sure that this does not happen-the only way to safeguard our

   search and development over the entire range of space tmlmology.
   This includes manned space flight, the development of nuclear-
   powered rockets, electric propulsion for spacecraft, advanced com-
   munications, satellite observations of the global weather picture,
   lunar and planetary exploration, and acquisition of new under-
   standing of the basic forces operating in our solar system and
   the universe. The space frontier has many salients, many dif-
   ferent points of activity. We must not lag behind in any a m

   develop our space cumpetence-our space muscle and space skills

December 6: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, addressing the Na-
    tional Association of Manufacturersâ€™ 68th Annual Congress of
    American Industry, in New York City, said :
       â€œAlthough our decision to launch a vigorous effort in space
    was, in part, a response to a threat to our security, it also stemmed
    from recognition of the changing requirements for industrial and
    economic growth, and the fact that to maintain leadership in the
    new age of science and technology, our resoiirces must be organized
   on a national scale. Thus the technological advances which it
    produces will come not as the mere by-product of an effort
    launched to satisfy other needs, but as the fruit of an effort delib-
    erately undertaken to stimulate advances in the forces that make
    for economic growth, and meet the demands of a nation immersed
   in a new flood of scientific discovery and technical progress.
                                                                     467
               ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1 9 63

         â€œThroughout history, and even in the early yeam of the present
      century, man has been slow in the application of basic discoveries
      to practical use. In the past,. the utilization of new technology
      has rarely depended so much on the worth of the discovery as on
      what one economist has called â€˜the mentality of the times.â€™ The
      willingness of people to accept and appreciate change, the belated
      appreciation of a previously undetected need, an imaginative
      leadership able to foresee the tmtial applications and benefits
                                     Kâ€œ
      of new ideas, coupled with t e wisdom and determination to
      insure that new knowledge is put to practical use, have always
      been key elements in the march of human progress.
         â€œToday, confronted with an unprecedentsd explosion of knowl-
      edge, and an ever shortening time lag between discovery or in-
      vention and practical use, the search for new knowledge and its
                                                                    not if

      were being transmitted sucessfully with electricity from the Snap-
     9A isotopic power generator. Desiped to provide 25 watts of
     direct eiectricai current, the Snap-SA was the same type of gen-
     erator as that providing power for a satellite launched from Van-
     denberg earlier this year. The two Snap-9Aâ€™s are designed for

                               i
     least 900 years so that by t e time they re-enter earthâ€™s atmosphere
     they will be almost completely decayed. At that time they are
     designed to burn into minute particles which will be widely dis-
     persed in the atmosphere, thus increasing radioactivity in the

   lect equal to that supplied by the 40,000 engineers and scientists
   that will by next year be working on our project to land men on

   found the answer: how to mount a mass attack by men with the
   kind of training acquired in the physical sciences to work on these
   problems in the humanities in which detailed, repeatable, and
   controlled experiments cannot be made. This, I think, is a great

    At news conference on the henomena of pneumatic tire hydro-
       planing, at NASA Hq., Wa!i ter B. Horne and Robert C. Dreher
      of NASA Langley Research Center described results of experi-
      ments conducted with automobiles traveling mi wet roads. On
      highway curve where maximum safe speed is posted as 45 mph,
       automobile with tire pressure of 25 psi did not reach hydro-
       planing speed until about 52 mph; automobile with tire pressure
       of 16 psi attained hydroplaning speed at 40 mph and swung out
      of control. Mr. Horne said: â€œIn this country, most aiitomohiles
      use tire inflation pressures between 16 and 30 pounds per square
      inch. This is a hydroplaning speed between 42 miles an hour
       and 55 miles an hour.
          â€œThis hydroplaning speed range is well within the higher legal
      speed limits on roads in this country. Therefore, automobiles are
      real susceptible to hydroplaning.â€ He exploded the popular no-
      tion that reducing tire pressure makes driving on wet roads safer.
       â€œAbout the only place where it does any
         ressure is when you are driving on san
      righer flotation.â€ (AP, Wash. Eve.

 Rep. Bob Wilson (R.-Calif.) mid on House floor that U.S. air-

   plus commercial transport we will see that within no more than
   a year after the first one flies it will be modified-at relatively
   little expen-to      give substantially better performance. Our
   aircraft industry has demonstrated this sort of design flexibility
   throughout its history . . . . There is a natural evolution that
   takes place when economic and engineering considerations become
   compatible. There is no reason to fear that this will not take
   place in the case of the supersonic aircraft. When we upset this
   normal progression we incur additional ex ense and introduce
   both operational problems and safety hazar f;s . . . .

       Dr. Hornig was reported as saying that the place of basic re-
   search was distorted by the legacy of World War I1 when concen-
   trated scientists were able to convert the most abstract scientific
   notions into impressive useful devices :â€œThe days of pie-in-the-sky
   p r o m k of basic research are over. The mood 20 years ago was
   one that suggestd b turning loose great numbers of scientists
   m i m l e s happened. &ell they did happen, and I suppose it was
   logiml that after the war the mme notion would carry over.
       â€œOnly it doesnâ€™t work that way today. Miracles of the kind per-
    formed during the war are a little harder to find. Scientists are
   no lon er concentrated nor are their e.fforts. They do come, of
          %
   course, ut over periodsof years . . . .
       â€œThe meaning of Sputnik,â€ Hornig said, â€œwas that it demon-
    strated the Soviets were capable of big-time technology ; capable,
    if you will, of playing in the big leagues.â€ H e declined to label
    the American attempt to send men to the moon as a â€œrace.â€
       â€œThe moon is, after all, the first im ortant object beyond the
                                            E
    earth. . . . There are valid scientific o jectives to be pursued on
    the moonâ€™s surface all linked to gaining new insights into cos-
    mology and to providing clues to manâ€™s destiny. That is, where
    we came from. . . . (H. Simons, Wmh. Post, 12/15/63, E 3 )

                   Q
    successfully egun. The world arms race has been slowed. The
    struggle for human rights has been gaining new force.
       â€œAnd a start has been made in furthering mankindâ€™s common
    interest in outer space, in scientific exploration, in communica-
    tions, in weather forecasting, in banning the stationing of nuclear
   weapons, and in establishing principles of law . . . .
       â€œThe greatest of human problems, and the greatest of our com-
    mon tasks, is to keep the peace and save the future. All that we
    have built in the wealth of nations, and all that we plan to do
    toward a better life for all, will be in vain if our feet should slip,
    or our vision falter, and our hopes ended in another worldwide
    war. I f there is one commitment more than any other that I
    would like to leave with you today, it is my unswerving strength-
    ening of the peace. Peace is a journey of 1,0oO miles, and it must
    be taken one step at a time . . . .â€ (Text)

    Public Lam 88-113 whereby â€˜â€œa detailed study of the geo-
   graphic location of, the need for, and the nature of, the proposed
    centerâ€™ â€ should be made. Long was referring to the selection of a
    site for and the building of a $50-million electronics research cen-

    conduct this study had not given su5cient consideration to all

   by, had failed to serve the national interest. (Câ€˜R, 1/22/64,934)
 I>r. Nicholas E. Golovin of the Presidentâ€™s Office of Science and
    Technology told National Space Club in Washington that low
    reliability of Scout booster (50%) was because of difficulties in
    four-stage booster teclmology. A basic difficulty to be overcome
    in future space systems, he said, lyas development of long-lifetime
   components and subsystems. Todayâ€™s missile system technology
   requires operational lifetime of less than a half hour; but Apollo
   would require 400 times that long and Mars fly-by mission, up to
   20,000 times that long. The other basic problem for future space
   systems, he said, was achieving greater reliability with less flight
   testing. (Space Bus. Daily, 12/18/63,417)

December 18: Editorializing about possible cuts in Rover project,
   New York: Times said :
       â€œ. . . The effort to build a nuclear-powered rocket for eventual
    manned exploration beyond the moon is a longer-term project
    [than Project Apollo], one which might eventually be accom-
    plished by joint work of Soviet and American scientists, or per-
    haps even by a broader international team. Any proposal to kill
    this program in its entirety appears to us unsound; while to con-
    tinue it at a substantially reduced rate would retain the gains of
    past research and continue slowly to increase our capabilities in
    this field. Such a course of action would mean minimum loss for
    the nationâ€™s near- and medium-term space goals, give us bargain-
    ing power in negotiations for a joint effort with the Soviet Union
    and still provide useful savings.â€ ( N Y T , 12/18/63, 40)

    in orbit by a new fourth stage (X-258) of the Scout booster.
   Apogee was lower than planned and resulted in an orbital period
    almost six min. less than planned. This, plus a very weak signal

  Martin-Marietta Corp. of Baltimore announced its research efforts
    had demonstrated continuous electrical current generated by
    magnetohydrodynamics ( M H D ) . Scientists of Martin Mariettaâ€™s
    nuclear division said they achieved this goal-passing a stream of
    high-temperature ionized gas through a magnetic field to generate
    electricity-by solving the major problem of equipmentâ€™s melting
    from the heat necessary in the MHD process. They used principle
    of magnetically induced nonequilibriuni ionization of gasLs,     in
    which temperature of the electrons is made higher than that of
    the as itself; the electrons then conduct electricity without
             f
    pena ty of overheating. Experiments employed helium gas seeded
    with molten cesium droplets to enhance ionization. Dr. Mostafa
    Talaat, project director, said current generated was a few
    thousandths of an ampere. First practical use of MHD power
    generation, combined with heat derived from nuclear reactor,
    was estimated at 5-10 years away. (Schmeck, N Y T , 12/20/63,

     can they be considered statistically representative of, the transfers
     which have taken place.

        â€œ&me (the interval between the inception of an innovation

     water and that â€œmost probablyâ€ there are pools of water below
     the rocky surface.

Dukng Demmber :NASAâ€™s         trend toward more incentive-type contracts
   was outlined in Commerce Clearing House report, pointing out
   that in early 1962 NASA had no incentive-type contracts, by end
   of June 1963 NASA had awarded 10 large incentive contracts with
   others in negotiation, and by June 1964 the number of incentive
   contracts was expected to be increased by a large margin.
   Incentive-type contracts were expected to lower costs and im-
   prove work performance, in place of cost-plus-fixed-fee type.

  U.S.S.R. has failed in at least 13 attempts to send probes to Mars,
    Venus, and the moon since October 1960, Astronautics and Aero-
    space Engineering reported, and these failures were chiefly caused
    by inability of fourth stage to send the payload out of parking
     orbit. A&AE concluded, â€œit seems clear that the Russians have
    need for an improved upper stage to launch deep-space vehicles,
     and that Polyot I fills the bill.â€ (AQAE,12/63,90)
During 1963: Manâ€™s conquest of space moved from spectacular hazard
    toward routine accomplishment, from the exhilarating peaks and
    slumps of first-generation hardware and experiments to the
     steadily improving reliability and capability of second- and third-
     genemtion launch vehicles and satellites. NASA launched 13 major
     space shots, with mission results of 11 successes, 1 partial success
     and 1 unsuccessful, compared with the 1962 record of 19 succeSses,
     4 partial successes, and 3 unsuccessful. Project Mercury ended
     with L. Gordon Cooperâ€™s 22-orbit flight; Project Apollo began
     its flight tests with two unmanned capsule tests. Communica-
     tions satellites demonstrated near-synchronous orbit and Saturn
     and Centaur boosters moved toward operational status with suc-
     cessful test flights. U.S.S.R. conducted a 129-orbit tandem flight
     and orbited an unmanned prototype of a new manned maneuver-
     able space capsule. NASA Administrator James E. Webb cited R S
              greatest specific accomplishment of 1963 the fact that
     NASAâ€™s
     his key staff people in Headquarters and the Centers had â€œlearned
     to supervise the efforts a t hand,â€ that he now has â€œthe men
     matched with the job and the job matched with the men.â€

   It is of interest that 1963 was the f r t year in annual editions of this
                                        is
appendix that the total number of US. launches fell below that of the
previous year (44compared to 57 in 1962). On the other hand, the
total number of payloads put into space continued to increase (66 t o
62 in 1962) because of the large step-up in DODâ€™S use of multiple
satellites on a single launch vehicle (21 secondary satellites compared
with 5 in 1962).
   As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of
these appendixes is never complete because of the inescapable lag be-
hind the flight of the analysis and interpretation of the scientific
results.

      CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHINGS
     JANUARY 1,1963, THROUGH DECEMBER 34 1963
  This chronol                                       during 1963 is in-
                      of major NASA launch-

tended to prom e an accurate and ready historical reference, one
compiling and verifying information reviously scattered over several
                                       P
sources. It includes launchings of a 1 vehicles larger than sounding
rockets launched either by NABA or under â€œNABA directionâ€ (e.g.,
NASA launched and tracked mm-1 for AEC).
  An attempt has been made to classify the performance of both
the launch vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results
in terms of primary mission. Three cahgories have been used for
vehicle performance and mission results-successful (S), partially
successful (P), and unsuccessful (U). A fourth c a t e r , unknown
 (Unk), has been provided for payloads where lam vehicle mal-
functions did not give the payload a chance to exercise its main
experiments These divisions are necessarily arbitrary, since many of
the results cannot be neatly ca.tagorized. Also they i ore the fact
that a great deal was l a r n e d from shots that may haveTeen classified
ns uI1successfuI.
  A few unique items require separate treatment. Their dates have
been kept in sequence, but their history has been relegated to footnotes.
  Dates of launchings are referenced to local time at the launch site.
  Sources used were all open ones verified where in doubt from the
project &cw in NASA H . For &her information on each item,
