                              Foreword
           twelfth annual chronology of events in astronautics and aeronautics
   NASAâ€™s
reflects a US. space program redefined to be less costly and perhaps less
spectacular in the 1970s than in the previous decade-yet          this volume
records a continued and indeed matured response to the challenges of space,
both in scientific exploration and in practical uses.
   The year 1972 closed with the triumphant end of the Apollo program.
The mass of data from the manned explorations of the moon and data still
being collected by instruments left on the moonâ€™s surface combined with
events on earth to intensify awareness of our planet, especially the fragility
of its environment and the preciousness of its resources. In addition to
bringing insights into how the earth evolved and into the history and nature
of the moon, the flights-culminating in the new space records and investiga-
tions of ApoUo 16 and Apollo 17 during 1972-let us see our planet â€œas it
really is,â€ influencing long-range planning for future activities in space,
as well as in many other areas of life. The assimilation and interpretation
of lunar data will occupy many scientists around the world for at least a
decade to come.
   Several major events underscored the shift in emphasis from lunar
exploration toward study of our planet. President Nixon announced that the
United States would proceed to develop the reusable space shuttle, to reduce
the cost and risk of using space. NASA selected a configuration with reusable
boosters and orbiter and let the initial contracts to develop a practical and
economical system for both manned and unmanned missions in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, all Skylab components were delivered and flight crews were
readying for the 1973 missions that would feature prolonged research in
astronomy, earth resources, materials processing, and life processes, all
under the weightless conditions of earth orbit.
   A major step forward in space applications, turning space knowledge and
technology into practical benefits, was the launch of Erts 1 to begin global
observation of the earthâ€™s resources and environmental factors. Data from
Erts 1, from Skylab, and from remote-sensing aircraft were to be available
to users worldwide. Weather and communications satellites-including
Nimbus 5, Nom 2, Anik 1 for Canada, and two Intelsats-were orbited to
continue almost routine service to man from space. NASAâ€™s           technology
utilization program expanded the nationâ€™s technology base and attacked
problems in health and medical care, air and water pollution, transportation,
urban construction, and fire safety.
   Although a stretched-out space program reduced plans for a future Grand
Tour of all the outer planets to a focus on Jupiter and Saturn, and the
NERVA nuclear rocket program was reoriented toward a small, high-energy,
nuclear propulsion system for planetary missions, 1972 produced significant
firsts in space science. Pioneer 10 made the first probe of the Asteroid Belt
and flew on toward its December 1973 rendezvous with Jupiter and eventual
escape from the solar system. Pioneer 11 was to follow in 1973 for a meeting
with Jupiter in 1974. Mariner 9, launched in 1971, completed its mission

during 1972, photographically mapping the entire globe of Mars and
sending back information that revised our understanding of that planet.
We now know that Mars is geologically active; free-flowing water may have
existed in its ancient past. Mariner 9 data laid the groundwork for 1975-
1976 Viking missions to softland on Mars and search for evidence of life.
Mariner 10, to be launched in late 1973, would make the first explorations
of Mercury, flying by Venus on its way.
   Om 3 (Copernicm) opened new channels of information into the distant
reaches of the universe. The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory made the
first ultraviolet observations of Uranus, observed a supernova, and, at this
writing, has returned compelling evidence of the existence of black holes
in space. Explorer 47 and 48 joined satellites launched in previous years
to extend our knowledge of physics and astronomy.
   International cooperation took unprecedented steps in 1972. A U S -
U.S.S.R. agreement on cooperative use of outer space included plans for
an Apollo-Soyuz docking mission in 1975; another provided for coopera-
tion in science and technology. The European Space Research Organization
worked on plans to develop a space laboratory to be flown on NASAâ€™s
shuttle. NASA launched four satellites for other nations and four cooperative
spacecraft, and the President announced a US. policy of launch assistance
to other countries and international organizations.
           major efforts in aeronautics were directed chiefly toward quieter
   NASAâ€™s
engines; efficient, short-haul air transportation; and reduction of exhaust
emissions. The supercritical wing was flight-tested on the Navy T-2C trainer
and the Air Force TF-8A jet aircraft in joint advanced transport tech-
nology projects to permit savings in structural weight and increases in
cruise speed without increasing power. In the NASA-USAF proqram to develop
technology for landing manned space vehicles horizontally, the M2-F3
lifting body completed its 27th and final flight, having reached a speed of
1718 kilometers (1066 miles) per hour and a 21 800 meter (71 500 foot)
altitude. The program was to continue in 1973 with flights of the X-24B
in a new configuration.
   Thus, designed for realistic progress at a constant budget level of $3.4
billion, NASAâ€™s  1972 program in space and in the air was nonetheless marked
by the excitement of new tasks, new achievements, and the continued
increase in manâ€™s knowledge in many fields.

                                Preface
   Astronautics and Aeronautics for 1972, twelfth in this series of annual
chronologies, gives a brief day-by-day account of key events of the year in
space and in the air. It pinpoints dates, actors, new technology, decisions,
programs, achievements, and early evaluations of results, with notations to
sources. Some of the indirectly related technological and scientific events,
some indications of the impact on society and national and international
concerns, and a sampling of public and official reaction also are noted.
Not intended to develop a full picture, the brief references, when used with
the index and cross-references, can nevertheless outline the progress of a
given subject during the year and point to origins in previous years.
   Designed primarily for reference use within the Federal Government, the
volume is also offered to the public. The principal sources are those immedi-
ately available in NASA, other Federal agencies, Congress, the professional
societies, as well as the journals and the press, with verification from par-
ticipants. Often details that could be lost with time can be captured and
questions clarified while the participants are still at hand.
   General editor of this volume was the Deputy Director of the NASA
Historical Office, Frank W. Anderson, Jr., and the technical editor was
Mrs. Carrie E. Karegeannes. The entire Historical Office participated in
source selection, review, and publication. Archivist Lee D. Saegesser collected
current documentation. The Science and Technology Division of the Library
of Congress, under an Exchange of Funds agreement, drafted monthly
sezments in comment edition form; which were circulated for corrections,
additions, and use. At the end of the year, the entire manuscript was
reworked to include comments received and additional information that
was not available when the monthly segments were prepared. At the Library
Mrs. Patricia D. Davis, Mrs. Carmen Brock-Smith until October and Mrs.
Nancy L. Brun from December, and Mrs. Shirley M. Singleton carried
principal responsibility. Arthur G. Renstrom of the Library prepared the
monthly indexes and Informatics TISCO, Inc., prepared the detailed index
for the annual volume. The index, indispensable to the usefulness of a
chronology, also serves as a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms.
   Appendix A. â€œSatellites, Space Probes, and Manned Space Flights, 1972,â€
Appendix B, â€œChronology of Major NASA I aunches, 1972,â€ and Appendix C,
â€œChronology of Manned Space Flight, 1972,â€ were prepared by Leonard C.
Bruno of the Library of Congress. Appendix D, â€œAbbreviations of Refer-
ences,,â€™ was prepared by Mrs. Davis.
   Without the assistance of many individuals throughout NASA and other
Federal agencies, the content of this volume would be less reliable and
complete. Comments, additions, and criticisms are always welcomed by the
NASA Historical Office.

                            January 1972

January I: ApoZZo 15 Astronauts David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, and
    Alfred M. Worden participated in pregame pageant at 1972 Orange
    Bowl Classic football game in Miami, Pageant, â€œThe First Decade,â€
    was dedicated to US. space program. (NASA Activities, 2/15/72,35)
January 2: Research inâ€™U.S. was shifting from pure to practical, Thomas
    Oâ€™Toole wrote in Washington Post. â€œChanges that stress practicality
    have already been made to parts of U.S. science, but theyâ€™re scarcely
    detectable against the $16 billion the federal government spends every
     year to support US. science and technology. One of the few programs
     of any size begun by the Nixon administration is a $49 million project
     at the National Science Foundation code-named RANN-for Research
     Applied to National Needs. RANN supports a host of small programs
     aimed at improving things like subways, cancer treatment, earthquake
     forecasts and sewers.â€
        Changes within NASA required â€œlittle new money, but they serve to
     spotlight the emphasis the Nixon administration places on the practical
     goals of science. In the last six months NASA has taken on study projects
     from the Departments of Commerce, Interior, and Transportation-
     none of which involves space exploration. The space agency also has a

  Aerospace industry outlook for 1972 was described in Aviation Week &
    Space Technology editorial: â€œMuch of the political miasma and public
              ..
    criticism . appears to be dissipating. The cruel bite of unemployment
     ...   has made it politically less attractive to attack technology. The
    legislators who were glad to equate their anti-technology votes with a
    blast at skin cancer now find these votes equated with stimulating
    unemployment. The industry will continue to be under vigorous public
    and legislative scrutiny and deserves it. But it has shown the first signs
    of fighting back and beginning to state its own very valid case.
    Hopefully, this will continue during the election year in an effort to
    force politicians to assess technology more accurately in their appeals
    to the electorate.â€ (Hotz, Av W k , 1/3/72, 7 )

     system designed to help transform the space frontier of the 1970â€™s into
     familiar territory, easily accessible for human endeavor in the 1980â€™s
     and 1990â€™s.
        â€œThis system will center on a space vehicle that can shuttle repeatedly
     from earth to orbit and back. It will revolutionize transportation into
     near space, by routinizing it. It will take the astronomical costs out of
     astronautics. In short, it will go a long way toward delivering the rich
     benefits of practical space utilization and the valuable spinoffs from
     space efforts into the daily lives of Americans and all people.
        â€œThe new year 1972 is a year of conclusion for Americaâ€™s current
     series of manned flights to the moon. Much is expected from the two
     remaining Apollo missions-in        fact, their scientific results should
     exceed the return from all the earlier flights together. Thus they will
     place a fitting capstone on this vastly successful undertaking. But they
     also bring us to an important decision point-a point of assessing what
     our space horizons are as Apollo ends, and of determining where we
     go from here.
        â€œIn the scientific arena, the past decade of experience has taught US
     that spacecraft are an irreplaceable tool for learning about our near
     earth space environment, the moon, and the planets, besides being an
     important aid to our studies of the sun and stars. In utilizing space to
     meet needs on earth, we have seen the tremendous potential of satellites
     for intercontinental communications and worldwide weather forecast-
     ing. We are gaining the capability to use satellites as tools in global
     monitoring and management of natural /resources, in agricultural

    applications, and in pollution control. We can foresee their use in
    guiding airliners across the oceans and in bringing televised education
    to wide areas of the world.
       â€œHowever, all these possibilities, and countless others with direct and
    dramatic bearing on human betterment, can never be more than frac-
    tionally realized so long as every single trip from earth to orbit remains
    a matter of special effort and staggering expense. This is why commit-
    ment to the space shuttle program is the right next step for America
    to take, in moving out from our present beachhead in the sky to
    achieve a real working presence in space-because the space shuttle
    will give us routine access to space by sharply reducing costs in dollars
    and preparation time.â€
       It was significant, President said, â€œthat this major new national
    enterprise will engage the best efforts of thousands of highly skilled
    workers and hundreds of contractor firms over the next several years.
    The amazing â€˜technology explosionâ€™ that has swept this country in the
    years since we ventured into space should remind us that robust activity
    in the aerospace industry is healthy for every one-not just in jobs and
    income, but in the extension of our capabilities in every direction. The
    continued pre-eminence of America and American industry in the aero-
    space field will be an important part of the shuttleâ€™s â€˜payload.â€™ ,â€™
       Shuttle program would â€œgive more people access to the liberating
    perspectives of space, even as it extends our ability to cope with
    physical challenges of earth and broadens our opportunities for inter-
    national cooperation in low-cost, multi-purpose space missions.â€
       President quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes : â€œWe must sail sometimes
    with the wind and sometimes against it, but we must sail, and not
    drift, nor lie at anchor.â€ President concluded, â€œSo with manâ€™s epic
    voyage into space-a voyaqe the United States of America has led and
    still shall lead.â€ (PD,1/10/72, 27-8; Transcript of Fletcher, Low

* Dr. James C. Fletcher, NAS.4 Administrator, released statement from San
    Clemente, Calif., following Presidentâ€™s announcement of decision to
    proceed with development of space shuttle. Decision was consistent
    with NASA FY 1972 budget and was â€œa most historic step in the nationâ€™s
    space program-it will change the nature of what man can do in space.
    By the end of this decade the nation will have the means of getting
    men and equipment to and from space routinely, on a momentâ€™s notice
    if necessary, and at a small fraction of todayâ€™s cost. This will be done
    within the framework of a useful total space program of science,
    exploration, and applications at approximately the present overall level
    of the space budget.â€
       Dr. Fletcher described shuttle as â€œairplane-like orbiter, about the
                     .
    size of a DC-9 . . capable of carrying into orbit and back again to
    earth useful payloads up to 15 feet [4.6 meters1 in diameter by
    60 feet [18 meters] long, and weighing up to 65,000 lbs [29 500 kg;].
    Fuel for the orbiterâ€™s liquid-hydrogen liquid-oxygen engines will be
    carried in an external tank that will be jettisoned in orbit.â€ Orbiter
    would be launched by unmanned booster and would operate in space
    for one week, during which crew could launch, service, or recover
    unmanned spacecraft; would perform experiments; and, in future,
    would resupply and restaff space modules brought to space by shuttle.

       He cited reasons â€œspace shuttle is important and is the right step in
   manned space flight and the US. space program.â€ First, â€œthe shuttle
   is the only meaningful new manned space program which can be
   accomplished on a modest budget. Second, the space shuttle is needed
   to make space operations less complex and less costly. Third, the space
   shuttle is needed to do useful things. Fourth, the shuttle will encourage
   greater international participation in space flight.â€
       Dr. Fletcher said NASA and contractors would focus until late
   February on technical areas, including comparisons of pressure-fed
   liquid- and solid-fuel rocket-motor options for shuttleâ€™s booster stage,
   before NASA issued requests for proposals in the spring. â€œThis summer
   we will place the space shuttle under contract and development work
   will start.â€
       At press conference in San Clemente following release of shuttle
   statements, Dr. Fletcher and Dr. Low discussed Presidentâ€™s decision.
    Dr. Fletcher said President was â€œparticularly anxious that I stress the
    international aspects of this. This program will be open to all nations
    of the world, and it is his hope some day that foreign visitors from all
    over the world will be able to participate by moving to and from space
    in the space shuttle.â€
       NASA anticipated that â€œat its peak. the direct employment on the
    space shuttle will be of the order of 50,000 individuals. Of course, a
    great many of those will be employed in this area.â€
       Responding to question, Dr. Fletcher said decision on shuttle launch
    site, â€œwhich will be the same as the landing site,â€™â€™ depended on
    recommendation of launch site selection group. â€œIt is not necessarily
    Cape Kennedv or any other site at this time.â€ (Text: Transcript)

    Soviet Space Programs, 1966-70 (Senate Document 92-51) was released
      by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. The 670-
      page report-prepared by Library of Congress under direction of
      Dr. Charles S. Sheldon 11, Chief of Science Policy Research Div.-
      noted that Soviet space program remained â€œa strong and growing
      enterpriseâ€ unhindered by budgetary strain and undimmed by deaths
      of three Soyuz cosmonauts in 1971. Current level of Soviet space
      activity exceeded that of US. at its peak in 1966, with perhaps 2%
      of Soviet gross national product devoted to space (US. spent about
      1% of its GNP at peak). Although U.S. launch record had been
      declining steadily since 1966, Soviet launches had continued to climb,
      at least until 1970. Contrary to assertion that it was concentrating its
      efforts on unmanned program rather than manned program, U.S.S.R.
      apparently was still planning manned lunar landing and might spend
      $49 million on both advanced unmanned and manned lunar programs.
      US. would have committed $35 billion to total Apollo program when
      complete.
          In unmanned research satellite program â€œthe level of activity
      currently runs ahead of the corresponding level of work at NASA.â€
      Compendium of every known Soviet launch that had achieved orbit
      showed that, along with scientific satellites, Cosmos program consisted
      of unmanned tests of spacecraft designed to carry cosmonauts, lunar
      and planetary probes that failed to leave earth orbit, unsuccessful Mars
      probes, and military research and development and observation satel-
      lites that accounted for 80% of Cosmos payloads. According to study,
      Cosmos series through April 1971 had included at least 16 tests of
      fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) and 22 tests of experi-
      mental spacecraft designed to inspect and destroy other nationsâ€™
      observation and navigation satellites.
          Soviet achievements in near future were dependent on success or
      failure of G booster (in Saturn V class) or similar booster. Studies
      of moon with Luna series spacecraft would continue, perhaps with
      spacecraft launched by advanced booster carrying both rovers and
      sample returners. Planetary program would continue, probably with
      flyby mission to Jupiter and landing mission to Mars. Dr. Sheldon
      stressed that â€œthe Soviet program is not a sham. It may be exploited
      for political purposes, but it is real and it is pursued in earnest.â€ (Text)

  Space shuttle concept endorsed by President Nixon made it â€œall but
    certainâ€ that Kennedy Space Center would be selected for shuttleâ€™s
    launch site, New York Times said. Space experts seemed to feel that
    only by â€œconverting the assembly buildings, launching pads and com-
    munications centerâ€ at KSC â€œwould it be possible to develop a shuttle
    port for $300 million.â€ (NYT, 1/7/72, 7)
  Newspaper editorials commented on decision to develop space shuttle.
       Kansas City Star: â€œThe next great step in space for the United
    States seems assured. President Nixon has pressed the go-ahead button
    and apparently it will be largely a matter of adequate funding by
    Congress. In view of the record of space accomplishments, there is not
    much doubt that the planned space shuttle program will be fruitful both
    from the standpoint of technological success and long-range scientific
    benefits.â€ (KC Star, 1/7/72)
       St. Louis Globe-Democrat: â€œThere are so many potentialities for
    the shuttle that it is hard to envision all of them. But there is no doubt
    that if it is completed space travel for the average citizen may become
    a distinct possibility in the 1980s.â€ (St Louis G-D, 1/7/72)

         Christian Scknce Monitor said â€œspace discovery versus human needs
      argument should not be seen as an either/or issue. This is so even
      leaving aside the jobs creation or economic return arguments.â€
      Monitor believed that â€œa space shuttle program, because it is so prac-
      ticalIy linked to fulfilling manâ€™s age-old vision of mastering the heavens,
      will unleash more constructive human energy than it will consume.
      And this excess will make meeting earthside demands the easier.â€

      clarification. â€œMost taxpayers welcomed the decision to end the waste-
      ful competition between NASA and the Air Force on the shuttle and

      military functions would be kept separate. â€œNo American wants the
      Soviet Union to tip the balance of power with its own space program.

     welcome cooperation on the space shuttle from other industrially
     developed nations, including the Soviet Union. The argument that the
     space shuttle is simply another SST boondoggle has little validity. The

    tractors to work directly with the European industries in that case.â€
    Europeans would supply money for parts developed by Europe. Second
    area was tug. â€œIf the tug were developed, we would expect it to be
    paid for by the Europeans.â€ Third area was sortie can, â€œexperiment-
    carrying device to be carried in the payload compartment,â€ which
    would give them â€œan opportunity to enter into the use of the shuttle
    very extensively.â€ European space officials would meet with NASA
    within two months to respond on interest in participating.
       Timetable called for selection of industrial contractors in summer
    1972, with subsonic and suborbital test flights beginning in 1975,
    manned orbital tests in 1978, and first fully operational mission by
    1980. Site evaluation board would make its next report to NASA within
    few weeks, and site for shuttle launch and recovery would be selected
    by spring. One site would be selected initially, with another or others
    selected later according to program needs. â€œWe donâ€™t see the shuttle

January 10-13: Third Annual Lunar Science Conference held by NASA
    and Lunar Science Institute at Manned Spacecraft Center was attended
    by more than 600 researchers from US. and 16 foreign countries.
    Foreign visitors included Soviet scientists Y. I. Belyayev, M. S.
     Chupakhin, and K. P. Florenskiy, who participated in conference,
    consulted with US. scientists, looked at lunar samples stored at MSC,
     and helped select samples to return to their colleagues in U.S.S.R.
     KASA provided three grams (one tenth ounce) of lunar material
     collected on A~oZZG14 mission as part of US.-U.S.S.R. agreements
    for exchange of samples. Samples included chip from widely studied
     crystalline rock, small piece of 9-kg (20-lb) boulder, and core samples
     soils, and polished thin sections.
        Conference papers dealt with scientific results of Apollo lunar land-
     ing missions, analysis of Soviet Luna 16 samples, and results of
     study of lunar surface by U.S.S.R.â€™s Lunokhod 1. A p ~ l 2 015 Astronauts

     observations of lunar surface made from lunar orbit during July 26-
     Aug. 7, 1971, mission. Dr. N. C. Costes, Marshall Space Flight Center
     representative of Apollo Soil Mechanics Investigation Science Team,
     discussed mechanical properties of lunar soil.
        Washington Post later compared conference with First Lunar Science

     magnetic field, of which remnants remained to suggest moon once
     had metallic core up to 280 km (175 mi) thick; lunar crust was 65 km
      (40 mi) deep and layered; existence of extinct plutonium 244 in

    Crater had been gouged 850 to 950 million yrs ago, making process
    one of more recent major lunar events.
        Dr. James R. Arnold of Univ. of California at San Diego reported
    that moonâ€™s radioactive elements were concentrated in two broad plains,
    Ocean of Storms and Sea of Rains. â€œAS we go away from this region
      ..
    . we drop to quite low levels of radioactivity.â€ Scientists agreed that
    these radiation emissions should not prove hazardous to astronauts
    who might visit for short period.
        Dr. Isidore Adler, Goddard Space Flight Center scientist, reported
    that map of lunar surface chemistry produced from ApoZZo 15 x-ray
    data indicated highlands of moon contained more aluminum than did
    plains. Finding supported hypothesis that moonâ€™s early crust was rich
    in feldspar.
        Dr. Gary V. Latham of Columbia Univ., Apollo Program chief
    seismic investigator, debated presence of volcanoes on moon with
    Cornel1 Univ. astronomer Dr. Thomas Gold. Dr. Latham said that
    while main episode of lunar vulcanism seemed to have ceased 3 billion
    yrs ago, â€œitâ€™s by no means certain that we do not have continuing
    vulcanism on a very minor scale on the moon.â€ Dr. Gold continued to
    support theory that moon was dead, rigid body with basins of
    compacted dust.
        Dr. Leon T. Silver of California Institute of Technology proposed
    theory of â€œparentless leadâ€ on moon to explain presence in some lunar
    locations of more lead than could have been produced by decay of
    radioactive uranium. In moonâ€™s extreme vacuum it was possible for
    vaporized lead to travel great distances from its parent, uranium.
    Dr. Silver said other materials could be distributed over lunar surface
    in same way, all of which could confuse analysis of moonâ€™s age.
        Dr. John A. Wood of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory dis-
    cussed tiny piece of green glass among ApoZZo 14 samples that scientists
    had nick-named â€œGenesis bean.â€ Bean and other glass fragments were
    almost identical chemically to rare meteorites, Howardites. Evidence
    suggested green glass had originated on moon and not from meteorite
    impacts on earth and thus might be some of earliest material of solar
    system.
        Consensus of conference on bulk composition of moon was sum-
    marized by Dr. Gast : feldspar-rich highland material with anorthosite
    as one prevalant component, basalts (solidified lava, low in radioactive
     elements and relatively young) in plains and basins, and KREEP (highly
     radioactive material rich in potassium, rare earth elements, and
    phosphorus).
        Conference closed with discussion of geologic setting of Apollo 16
     Descartes landing site and plans for missionâ€™s extravehicular activity.

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial commented on space shuttle decision:
      â€œManâ€™s ability to perform capably in a prolonged state of weightlessness
      has yet to be proven and until it is the arguments for a large shuttle
      program must remain inconclusive. Beyond this, the recent agreements
      between this country and the Soviet Union to exchange biomedical and
      other space data and to work toward compatible docking systems would
      seem to make a full scale shuttle program a prime candidate for a
      co-operative enterprise.â€ (St Louis P-D, 1/11/72)

      Harold Masursky, of US. Geological Survey, said in interview that
      chasm probably had been caused by â€œfaulting of the crust,â€ a cracking
      and sliding process associated with earthquakes. Masursky believed
      line of small craters running parallel to canyon had probably been
      caused by venting volcanic gases and ash. Wind erosion and landslides
      had probably altered canyon, but landscape in photo appeared to be
      geologically young. (Wilford, NYT, 1/20/72, 25)

  William Hines commented on space shuttle decision in Chicago Sun-
     Times: â€œWhat the President offered last week was not a completely
     reusable workhorse aerospace plane at all, but a scaled-down hodge-
     podge of obsolete, current and avant-garde technology that cannot
     possibly meet the stated goal of $100-a-pound payloads in 1980. The
     sad truth is that the original shuttle couldnâ€™t, either, once it became
     apparent that development costs would approximate $13 billion rather
     than the $5.2 billion estimated in 1969. As backers of the defunct
     supersonic transport finally had to admit, when you markedly alter
     the development cost of a flight system, you alter its economics also.â€

    by carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and aerosol was discussed by Dr. S.
    Ichtiaque Rasool. Study had indicated that â€œrunaway greenhouse
    effectâ€ from accumulation of man-made carbon dioxide alone probably
    was not possible. But, as aerosol dust in air increased, albedo increased
     (6
      very fast, compared to the opacity in the infrared; as the albedo
    increases, the solar radiation decreases, and the surface temperature
    goes down.â€ Temperature could decrease in next 30 yrs as much as
    about 3 K [5.4OF]. Several climatologists had suggested that â€œ3K
    decrease in global temperature is sufficient to trigger an Ice Age!â€

* Newspaper editorials commented on President Nixonâ€™s decision to develop
    space shuttle.
       Washington Post said arguments for or against shuttle were not
    bb
      error freeâ€ since â€œmajor ones rest on projections into the future
    which are exceedingly difficult to make and others rest on basically
    undemonstrable assumptions about the quest for knowledge. Part of
    the difficulty springs from the fact that no one can know what space-
    based research will discover. Is the key to the hydrogen atom and thus
    to unlimited energy out there . . .? Will the world some day need to
    import minerals from space to sustain life here? Will man have to
    be in space to accomplish things such as these or can machines do them
    all? Above all, where does this kind of program fit in a national budget
    that cannot provide for doing all the things at home that ought to be
    done?â€ Such questions would make debate over space shuttle â€œdifferent
    in character and significance from last yearâ€™s debate over the SST.â€

         Houston Post: â€œWith the last Apollo moon flight scheduled later
    this year and the Skylab project to terminate in 1973, the shuttle holds
     the key to an on-going space program. Our failure to build it would
     indicate our lagging interest in space research to the possible detri-
     ment of future cooperation with the Russians in this field. It is true that
     we have important social priorities which need attention, but our

January 17-21 : Fourth Annual Earth Resources Program Review was held
    by NASA at Manned Spacecraft Center. Scientists from foreign nations
    and organizations, Government, universities, and private institutions
    attended. Reports were presented on 1971 research and analysis of air-
    craft and spacecraft remote sensing data.
       In Jan. 18 press briefing NASA Associate Administrator for Applica-
    tions Charles W. Mathews said pollution monitoring was natural activ-
    ity for global surveillance capability because atmospheric pollution was
     potentially global problem. Not well understood were manner in which
     pollutants were dispersed throughout globe or manner in which earth
     corrected itself. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of work to be done in this area.â€
        In Jan. 21 briefing Dr. John M. DeNoyer, NASA Director of Earth
     Observations, said program was moving from exploratory to flight
    phase, from learning to applying techniques. Among applications was
     spring Arctic ice survey, in which some 80 scientists would be on ice
     measuring strain rates, meteorological conditions, and ice types, sup-
     ported by Convair 990 aircraft from Ames Research Center. Also micro-
     wave techniques in remote sensing could identify ice-free lanes in Great
     Lakes region, making possible efficient shipping much earlier in spring
     than at present. So0 Canal into Lake Superior, which carried more tons
     of freight than any other canal in world, was now open only one half
     of year. Weather and cloud cover made aircraft surveillance inefficient;
     microwave techniques from satellite altitude was more practical in this
     instance. Another important program would be thermal mapping by
     remote sensing to permit better industrial planning from knowledge of
     how development would actually affect environment. Land-use planning

January 18-20

    receipt of Jan. 14 letter from Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administra-
    tor, announcing change in NASA office name from OART to OAST.
       On first day of hearings Dr. Fletcher testified on â€œsteady increaseâ€ in
    NASA funding for aeronautics: Funding had grown from $42 million in
    FY 1966 to $110 million in FY 1972, â€œa doubling in terms of constant
    dollars. When you add the funding for salaries and other in-house costs
                                                               ..
    related to supporting the aeronautics programs, the total . has grown
    from 1.6% of the total NASA budget in fiscal year 1966 to 7.1% in fiscal
    year 1972.â€ Number of NASA personnel members working in aeronautics
    research and technology had grown from 2600 in 1966 to 5300. In-
    crease had occurred while NASA staff had been reduced from 34000 to
    27 500.
       Dr. Fletcher said joint Dept. of Transportation and NASA Study on
    Civil Aviation Research and Development (CARD) had â€œforced the
    establishment of new and more effective coordination mechanisms be-
    tween NASA and DOT.â€ Mechanisms were being used â€œto develop a formal
    CARD Policy Implementation Plan to specify clear goals, responsibili-
    ties, planned achievement milestones, and projected resource require-
    ments for DOT and NASA jointly.â€ CARD policy study had caused â€œbetter
    focus on the priority problem areas of aircraft noise . . . and terminal
    congestionâ€ and directed more specific attention to role R&D might
    play in developing better total operating system for low-density aviation
    market so that civil aviation might be used more economically as tool
    for regional development. Focus did not compromise â€œability to con-
    tinue a comprehensive research and technology program in all the
    aeronautical disciplines to provide a technology base for the future.â€
       Deputy Director Clarence A. Syvertson of Ames Research Center out-
    lined general recommendations of CARD study : scope of civil-aviation
    R&D programs should be expanded to emphasize nontechnological fac-
    tors; economists and social scientists should be assigned to NASA and
    DOT staffs. R&D staffs of Dept. of Defense, NASA, DOT, and Civil Aero-
    nautics Board should be interchanged to provide broad systems back-
    ground for more effective Government action in civil aviation pro,urams.
    CAB should explore policy of allowing intermodal mergers of airlines for
    expanded use of air cargo to encourage innovative industry R B ~ Din
    this area. Dept. of Commerce should refine and monitor measurable
    indicators of US. progress in civil aviation industry. National Aero-
    nautics and Space Council should review and recommend national poli-
    cies guiding civil aviation that embraced several agencies.
       George W. Cherry, Deputy Administrator for Programs in OAST,
    reported â€œconsiderable ongoing activity abroad in designing, building
    and selling new, small economical aircraft for the worldâ€™s low-density
    short-haul market. This raises the questions: Where will replacement
    aircraft come from? Can the US. industry compete with the foreign
    manufacturers to fill the market? â€ Answers required â€œfundamental
    policy decisions by the United States with regard to the desirability of
                                                                            .
    providing continuing or expanded public-need air service, and also . .
    to whether Government support can or should be given to the manu-

       US. needed to know more about market and economics of operating
    in low-density area to write specifications for aircraft and operating

    cations, there should be enough information available to determine if
                              .
    Government assistance . . could result in the operator providing viable
    service. If subsidy is necessary, subsidizing the nonrecurring costs of
    manufacture, rather thaa the recurring costs of operation, might make
    good sense.â€
       NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology
    Roy P. Jackson described QUESTOL project plans for two quiet, experi-
    mental, short takeoff and landing (STOL) transport research aircraft:
    66
      The experimental airplanes will function as a versatile facility for
    NASA flight research programs developed in cooperation with other Gov-
    ernment agencies and interested industry groups, including the airlines.
    The information provided will reduce the technical risk associated with
    development, by industry, of both civil and military STOL transportsâ€
    and â€œprovide a comprehensive technical foundation on which Govern-
    ment regulatory agencies can establish realistic criteria for certification
    of commercial subsonic STOL transport aircraft and for en route and
    terminal area operations.â€ (Transcript)
January 19: NASA announced selection of flight crews for Skylab missions.
    Prime crewmen for first, 28-day flight were Charles Conrad, Jr. (com-
    mander), Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin (science pilot), and Paul J. Weitz
     (pilot). Backup crewmen were Russel L. Schweickart, Dr. Story Mus-
    grave, and Bruce McCandless 11.
        Crewmen for second, 56-day mission were Alan L. Bean, Dr. Owen K.
    Garriott, and Jack R. Lousma. Third mission, for 56 days, would be
    flown by Gerald P. Carr, Dr. Edward G. Gibson, and William R. Pogue.
    Backup crew for second and third missions was Vance D. Brand, Dr.
    William B. Lenoir, and Dr. Don L. Lind. (NASA Release 72-12)
* Skylab crew press conference, with prime and backup crewmen, was held
    at Manned Spacecraft Center. Astronaut Charles Conrad, Jr., said prep-
    arations were on schedule for April 1973 launch. Contractor checkouts
    and tests of hardware were expected to be completed for delivery to
    Kennedy Space Center in July. Skylab would carry some 20 000 pieces
    of stowage equipment on board to provide life support for nine men
    for 140 days. â€œSOit all goes up at one time, and weâ€™ve got a great deal
     of work to do, not only to learn how to operate this vehicle but also all
    the experiments in it. It became apparent that we could not be 100 per-

     out the training hours. Right now      we have some 2000 training hours
    per man defined. Weâ€™ve been working on the basic training for the past
    year.â€ Training hardware would be available about February 1. Com-
    mander would have overall responsibility for mission and would be
    command and service module expert. Science pilot would be expert in
     all medical equipment and in Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) and its
     associated hardware. Pilot would be expert in Orbital Workshop sys-
    tems and electrical systems. Remaining experiments would be divided
     among crewmembers according to availability and choice.
        Astronaut Alan L. Bean said photographic data returned from Skylab
     would be â€œfar superiorâ€ to previous data because actual film would be
     returned to earth. To return film, crews would conduct two extra-
     vehicular activities (EVAS) on first mission, three on second, and two on
                                           ..

    remove the used exposed film and replace it with new film. Itâ€™s going
    to take about 3 hours.â€
       Experiments were described by Astronaut Gerald P. Carr. They in-
    cluded EREP earth resources experiment containing five sensors to cali-
    brate earthâ€™s atmosphere, corollary experiments submitted by high
    school students, engineering experiments to study effects of zero g on
    metal alloys and flammability of certain items, habitability experiments
    to study noise levels and atmospheric composition, and scientific ex-
    periments. Scientific experiments would include studies of effect of
    zero g on single human cells, studies of circadian rhythm of pocket
    mice and vinegar gnats, ultraviolet stellar astronomy and x-ray astron-
    omy. Technological experiments would include crew vehicle disturb-
    ances, manual navigation sightings, and â€œa study of the little contamina-
                                                 ..
    tion cloud that we carry around with us . kind of like Pigpen in
    Peanuts.â€
       In response to question on illness during missions, Astronaut Joseph
    P. Kerwin said NASA would provide equipment and training on board
    to take care of most illnesses and injuries that could be handled in a
    doctorâ€™s office. Science pilot would be able to provide emergency care
    for illnesses â€œup to and including quite severe. We have quite a pack-
    age of drugs on board, administrable by all routes; we have tracheot-
    omy equipment and equipment for maintaining an airway for stopping
    bleeding. We are attempting to develop in time for the flight intrave-
    nous fluids. We feel that, almost regardless of the severity of the injury,
    we will at least be able to stabilize the patient.â€ (Transcript)

January 20: President Nixon delivered State of the Union address before
    joint session of Congress and sent written message to Congress. He said
    in speech: â€˜â€˜In reaching the moon, we demonstrated what miracles
    American technology is capable of achieving. Now the time has come
    to move more deliberately toward making full use of that technology
    here on earth, of harnessing the wonders of science to the service of
    man.â€ He would propose new â€œFederal partnershipâ€ in technological
    research and development â€œwith Federal incentives to increase private
                                                             .

    everyday lives.â€
       In written message President said dealings with U.S.S.R. had â€œad-

   vanced the prospects for limiting strategic armaments. We have moved
   toward greater cooperation in space research and toward improving
   our economic relationships.â€
       President said he would request Dept. of Defense budget increase â€œto
   preserve the sufficiency of our strategic nuclear deterrent, including an
    allocation of over $900 million to improve our sea-based deterrent
   force.â€ He had instructed DOD â€œto develop a program to build addi-
    tional missile launching submarines, carrying a new and far more effec-
   tive missile.â€
       Space program had been reoriented to produce increased domestic
   benefits: â€œIn recent years, America has focused a large share of the
   technological energy on projects for defense and for space. These proj-
    ects have had great value. Defense technology has helped us preserve
    our freedom and protect the peace. Space technology has enabled us to
    share unparalleled adventures and to lift our sights beyond earthâ€™s
    bounds. The daily life of the average man has also been improved by
    much of our defense and space research-for example, by work on
    radar, jet engines, nuclear reactors, communications and weather satel-
    lites, and computers. Defense and space projects have also enabled us
    to build and maintain our general technological capacity, which-as a
    result-can now be more readily applied to civilian purposes.
      66
         America must continue with strong and sensible programs of
    research and development for defense and for space. I have felt for
    some time, however, that we should also be doing more to apply our
    scientific and technological genius directly to domestic opportunities.
    Toward this end, I have already increased our civilian research and
    development budget by more than 40 percent since 1969 and have
    directed the National Science Foundation to give more attention to
              .
    this area . . .
        â€˜â€œI recently announced support for the development of a new earth
     orbital vehicle that promises to introduce a new era in space research.â€
    Reusable space shuttle would lower cost and risk of space operations
    and open new opportunities in weather forecasting, communications,
    monitoring natural resources, and air traffic safety. â€œThe space shuttle
    is a wise national investment.â€
        Proposals included increase of $700 million in civilian R&D, 15%
    increase over previous year. And technically oriented agencies like
     NASA and Atomic Energy Commission would work more closely with
     agencies with primary social mission like Dept. of Transportation. ( P D ,

9 New York Times editorial commented on results of Third Lunar Science

    Conference at Manned Spacecraft Center [see Jan. 10-131 : "Science
    fiction writers predicted long ago that the moon would be colonized;
    some even projected a future 'revolution' by lunar settlers against
    domination from the earth. Though such writers could skip over the
    many difficulties and high costs required by any genuine settlement
    attempt, there is now increasing evidence that the moon may not be
    quite so inhospitable as scientists once believed. The possibility that
    on this, too, the science fiction writers may have been prophets no
    longer seems as fantastic as it did before the first men walked on the
    moon." (NYT, 1/21/72, 46)

January 22-25: Zntelsat-ZV F-4 comsat was launched by NASA for Com-
    munications Satellite Corp. on behalf of International Telecommunica-
    tions Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT) . Launched from Eastern Test
    Range at 7:12 pm EST by Atlas-Centaur booster, satellite entered ellipti-
    cal transfer orbit with 36 523-km (22 694.3-mi) apogee, 5984-km
     (3718.3-mi) perigee, and 28.2" inclination. Primary objective was to
    place satelIite in transfer orbit accurate enough for onboard propulsion
    systems to transfer it to planned synchronous orbit for commercial
    communications over Pacific.
       Apogee-kick motor was fired at 7:32 pm EST Jan. 24 and Zntelsat-ZV
    F 4 entered circular orbit with 35 787-km (22 237-mi) apogee, 25 625-
    km (22 136.4-mi) perigee, 23-hr 52-min period, and 0.7" inclination
    over Pacific at 165" east longitude. It would drift 1.1" per day to reach
    station at 174' east longitude in early February. Satellite's first major
    mission would be coverage of President Nixon's visit to People's Re-

January 22: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, discussed NASA
    plans for continuing fruitful space program in interview published by
    Christian Science Monitor: â€œFor the next few years, we may have fewer
                                                      .     .
    of the more spectacular explorational missions . . We will focus
    more on . . . communications satellites, weather satellites, earth re-
    sources survey satellites.â€
       Next Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) would demonstrate
    direct TV broadcasting in region of Rockies and Alaska, using large
    satellite with big antenna that could beam programs directly to aug-
    mented receivers in individual homes. Demonstration-in cooperation
    with Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare-would work through
    educational network rather than directly to homes, however.
       Comsats were â€˜â€˜not quite so exciting an aspect of space technologyâ€
    in US. but, â€œworldwide, there has been more interest in this than in
    almost any other aspect of our program.â€ Interest equaled that of ERT
    satellite. â€œCountries with vigorous mineral exploitation and agricultural
    development are interested in ERT satellites . . . . Countries with under-
    developed communications and education, such as India, are keenly
    interested in the broadcasting satellites.â€
       In weather satellite field, new sophisticated instruments â€œgive hope
    that we can get a really world weather observing network going.â€
    Infrared sensors, microwave sensors, and high-resolution optics that
    obtained temperature profiles throughout atmosphere by looking
    â€œthrough holes in cloud systemsâ€ should help â€œto get points all over
    the globe where we now get only pieces of the picture.â€
        NASA would try processing materials in zero g during Skylab program.
    â€œIf it works with men doing it, there are cheaper ways we could do it
    without men. It may be one of those things that will be worth doing
    when we can get routine access to space with the shuttle.â€
        In response to question, Dr. Fletcher said second Skylab would be
    cba  very good thing for the country. But Iâ€™m not sure the budget needed
     â‚¬or both a Skylab and the shuttle would be salable. The shuttle is more
    important in the long run. Not to do more of the Skylab sort of thing
     will be bad for prestige. The Russians will be doing much more than
     we will. Iâ€™m sure there will be criticism from Congress and the public.â€
     But with shuttle and current budget level, â€œwe could do virtually all
     those things we have talked about doing in this century. We could go
                                                      .
     back to the moon and establish crude bases . . . We could establish
     a permanent space station. We just might be able to send men to Mars
     and get them safely home.â€
        Apollo industrial base had already been destroyed, Dr. Fletcher said.
     â€œWe could assemble a nucleus of people who know these things within
     NASA. But thatâ€™s about all.â€ As NASA turned toward space shuttle, â€œWe
     hope and expect that many of the people who worked on Apollo will be
     in that program, so we wonâ€™t lose all the basic space flight know-how.â€
        In international cooperation, France had asked to participate in Sky-
     lab mission and US-U.S.S.R. meetings to establish compatible space
     docking system had progressed. â€œIt looks as though we can do it tech-
     nically. With existing hardware, we could do a docking in something
     like 1974 to 1975.â€

        Scientific community was â€œstill debating whether it would prefer an

    Sheldon 11, Chief of Science Policy Research Div.-updated           Senate
     Document 92-51 released Jan. 6 and discussed future directions and
     significant aspects of space programs. Soviet planetary probes Mars 2
     (launched May 19, 1971) and Mars 3 (launched May 28, 1971) were
     studying temperatures, density, and constituents of Martian ionosphere,
     atmosphere, and surface. Joint experiment with France on Mars 3 had
     been studying solar wind. With Soviet start in planetary exploration
     during 1971, US. should continue to feel competition in planetary pro-
     gram until NASA Viking landed on Mars in 1976. NASA future plans
     gave prominent priority to space shuttle. While Soviet plans for reusable
     space vehicle had not been divulged, â€œit is hard to imagine their attain-

     of putting up space station in five years. â€œIt may be that the long
     awaited new large launch vehicle will find use in lifting major com-
     ponents for such a station. Using this vehicle, the U.S.S.R. could put
     up its equivalent of the US. Skylab any time from 1972 on.â€ U.S.S.R.
     had recorded â€œwide variety of commitments . . . to conduct wide-
     ranging programâ€ of solar system exploration and of earth applications.
     They had discussed possibility of Grand Tour flights and of manned
     planetary missions. In space cooperation, â€œalthough no firm commit-
     ment has been made and no real timetable set, the possibility has been
     opened that some of the surplus Saturn IB and Apollo hardware might
     be used to send an American crew to dock with a future Soviet space
     station. Then perhaps later if a remaining Saturn V is used to put up
     a Skylab 2 . . . a Soviet Soyuz might send a crew to dock with it. More
     joint planning and more funds will be required to accomplish these
     suggestions.â€ (Text)

     to practical and economical applications of space and reductions in the
     cost of manned space flight.
          , . . we have strengthened our defense research and development
       6C


     capability to insure that the country will not face the possibility of
     technological surprise or lack of the deterrent power necessary to pro-
     tect our national security.â€ Therefore budget authority requested for
     Dept. of Defense research, development, technology, and engineering
      (RDT&E) was at all-time high.
         President proposed measures â€œto emphasize this Administrationâ€™s
     strong belief that science and technology can make significant contri-
     butions to the quality of American life and to economic growthâ€; to
     encourage private investment in R&D, including investment by small
      firms with innovative ideas; to use NASA and Atomic Energy Commis-
      sion talents on clean, economical energy and safe, fast transportation-
      â€œthis year we shall have the agency which sent men to the moon and
      back begin to assist the Department of Transportation in finding better
      ways to send people downtown and backâ€-and          to review economic
      policies which might restrict utilization and development of technical
      advances.
         President also said human resources spending would be 45% of
      FY 1973 budget, while defense programs would total 32%. Outlays
      requested for major environmental programs in 1973 were $2.5
      billion, â€œmore than three times the 1969 level.â€ (PO, 1/31/72, 104-17)

  President Nixon sent $246.3-billion FY 1973 budget request to Congress-
    increase of $9.6 billion over FY 1972. National total included research
    and development budget of $17.8 billion (increase of $1.4 billion),
    with $3.740 billion requested for civilian and military space R&D.
       Total request for NASA new obligational authority (NOA) of $3.379
    billion (1.3% of total U.S. budget) was $83 million more than FY
    1972 NOA of $3.296 billion. NASA expenditures were budgeted to
    increase by $11 million, against decline of $200.9 million in FY 1972.
    Increase to $3.192 billion reflected funds for design and development
    of space shuttle engine and airframe. Of budget request, $2.6 billion
    would go for R&D, $77.3 million for construction of facilities, and
    $701 million for research and program management.
       Apollo funding decrease of $472.5 million, to $128.7 million, reflected
    completion of Apollo program with Apollo 16 and 17 scheduled for
    launch during calendar year. Manned space flight operations-includ-
    ing $540.5 million for Skylab, $200 million for space shuttle, and $23
    million for orbital systems and experiments-would increase from
    $682.8 million in FY 1972 to $1.094 billion in FY 1973. Space life
    sciences would receive $25.5 million and development, test, and
    mission operations would receive $305.2 million, including funds for
    detailed design and development of shuttle airframe and engine.

    manned space flight (including Apollo) to $1.224 billion, down $61
    million from FY 1972.
       Funding for NASA space science and applications programs would
    increase $123.7 million, from $740.4 million in FY 1972 to $864.1
    million in FY 1973. Increases would go to physics and astronomy
    program for High Energy Astronomy Observatory ($59.6 million in
    FY 1973) and orbiting explorers ($32 million) ; to lunar and planetary
    exploration (up $29.7 million, to $321.2 million, with $229.5 million
    for Viking project, $31.6 million for Mariner-Venus/Mercury 1973,
    and $18.7 million for supporting research and technology advanced
    studies) ; and to launch vehicle procurement. Funding for Pioneer
    planetary exploration program would decrease from $12.8 million in
    FY 1972 to $10.2 million. Increase of $7.2 million in applications
    programs, to $194.7 million in FY 1973, included $48.4 million for
    earth resources survey, $61.2 milliofi for ATS, and $28.3 million for
    Nimbus.
       Total requested for NASA aeronautics and space technology programs
    increased from $212.8 million in FY 1972 to $249.3 million.
    Aeronautical research and technology funding would increase from
    $110 million in FY 1972 to $163.4 million, including $27.5 million
    for quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing (QUESTOL) aircraft
    and $3 million for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) research/
    experimental vehicle programs. Nuclear engine for rocket vehicle
    application (NERVA) development was terminated in favor of reoriented
    program to define smaller nuclear rocket system.
       Tracking and data acquisition funding would fall $4.9 million, to
    $259.1 million.
       Dept. of Defense FY 1973 budget of $83.5 billion was all-time high,
    $6.3 billion above FY 1972 budget authority, 30% of total Federal
    outlays for N 1972, and 6.4% of Gross National Product-but

   percentage of GNP had dropped from FY 1972's 7%. DOD total included
   $8.6 billion for research, development, technology, and engineering,
   $1.1 billion increase over FY 1972. Of requested RDT&E total, military
   astronautics-with major programs including military comsats, first
   spaceborne ballistic missile early warning system, continued flight
   experiment programs, and applied research and technology programs-
   would receive $454 million (up $49.4 million). Military sciences
   would receive $572.7 million (up $34.9 million). Aircraft RDT&E
   would receive $1.948 billion (down $36.8 million) and missiles RDT&E
   $2.383 billion (up $437.8 million).
      Major DOD increases were programmed for undersea long-range
   missile system ( ULMS) to supplement and eventually replace Poseidon-
   Polaris fleet ($942.2 million, up $802 million), B-1 advanced strategic
   bomber ($444 million, up $74 million), F-15 air superiority fighter
   ($910 million, up $490 million), airborne defense warning and control
   system (AWACS) ($470 million, up $331 million), and Safeguard
   antiballistic missile program ($1.483 billion, up $366 million). Some
   $299 million was requested for advance procurement of components
   for new nuclear-powered CVAN-70 aircraft carrier. Increases were
   also programmed for prototype development of vertical or short takeoff
   and landing aircraft for Navy, STOL transports for possible C-130
   replacement, Air Force SCAD strategic bomber penetration decoy, and
   engines for future transport and fighter aircraft.
      National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration FY 1973 budget
   included $39.9 million for meteorological satellite operations, $6.8
   million more than FY 1971 allocation of $33.1 million. Funding would
   complete financing of fourth satellite in ITOS series, continue financing of
   fifth and sixth ITOS satellites and one Geostationary Operational Environ-
   mental Satellite ( G O E S ) , and initiate procurement of seventh ITOS.
      Dept. of Transportation budget request of $8.56 billion was decrease
   of $91.5 million over FY 1972. DOT funding would start IO-yr,
   $10-billion program to improve urban mass transportation and reduce

*          released briefing (held Jan. 22) on FY 1973 budget request in
    NASA
      which Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, said budget would
      (6
        enable the United States space program to move forward on all fronts,
      on a basis consistent with realistic budgetary constraints both now and
      in the future.â€ Budget â€œfully supports President Nixonâ€™s decision to
                                                          ..
      proceed with development of the space shuttle, ,        achieves this and
      other basic objectives in science, in applications, and in aeronautics
      within a fiscal â€™73 budget approximately equal to that of last year,â€
      and â€œprovides programs to do the kind of work this agency should
      be doing.â€
         In past NASA had presented programs that required relatively modest
      outlays in first year and subsequent substantial increases. In FY 1973
      budget, â€œWe have a well-balanced program that can be supported at
      an essentially constant budget level over the next several years.â€
         â€œMost important aspectsâ€ of NASAâ€™s FY 1973 program were: â€œThe
      decision to proceed with the space shuttle; a strong effort in space
      science and applications; a major increase in aeronautics; a change
      of scope in the outer planet exploration program; and a reorientation
      of our nuclear rocket program.â€ Significant changes from FY 1972
      plans were in Grand Tour and nuclear engine for rocket vehicle
      application (NERVA) programs. Grand Tour of outer planets would be
      replaced with less complex missions to Jupiter and perhaps Saturn.
      In place of NERVA, NASA would concentrate on defining small, high-
      energy nuclear propulsion system for missions to explore planets.
         During 1973 and beyond, â€œNASA will put even greater emphasis on
      turning the knowledge and technology acquired through space research
      to the immediate and lasting benefits of mankind. The recent establish-
      ment of the Office of Applications was an important step in that
      direction.
         66
            In aeronautics we will increase our efforts by 50 percent this year,
      directed mainly at the pressing domestic needs for quiet engines and
      quiet short-haul air transportation systems.â€
         Dr. Fletcher said NASA FY 1973 budget â€œmaintains our manned
      space flight capability, contributes to national security, increases the
      opportunity for acquiring new scientific knowledge, encourages inter-
      national cooperation, addresses the problems of society and the
      environment, and helps to assure continued American leadership in
      aeronautics.â€
         Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, discussed space
      shuttle funding: â€œThe shuttle, as we now visualize itâ€--if it had
      pressure-fed boosters and 4.6- by 18.3-m (15- by 60-ft), 30000-kg
       (65 000-lb) capacity-â€œwill cost $5.5 billion to develop. This includes
      two flight vehicles.â€ Funding would â€œspread over more than 6 years,
      but the bulk of the funding will be expended over a six-year time
                             .
      period. In addition . . there will be an investment in facilities of
      about $300 million. And if more orbiters and boosters are needed for
      flight applications, these will cost $250 and $50 million apiece. Our
      current estimates for the cost per flight are $7.7 million. This is less
      than most of the launch vehicles weâ€™re using today.â€ (Transcript)

January 25: Apollo 16 spacecraft had developed fuel leak in reaction
     control system and would be removed from launch pad for replacement

   Subcommittee on NASA Oversight submitted to House Committee on
     Science and Astronautics Space Shuttle-Skylab :Manned Space Flight
     in the 1970's, status report prepared by Committee staff at request of
     Subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Olin E. Teague, from information from
     NASA space flight Centers and key industrial contractors.
        Conclusions on Skylab program were that program was within
     projected costs; bulk of equipment and systems were meeting design
     requirements in performance and reliability; and, despite some prob-
     lems in procuring and integrating experiments, schedules were being
     met and no flight delays or significant cost increases were anticipated.
     Serious consideration was recommended for several options : possibility
     of flying backup Skylab B in 1974-1976 period; possible revisits to
     Skylab A after first three flights; and use of remaining Saturn IB
     launch vehicles in earth resources and applications flights after
     Skylab A program, during 1974-1978 period.
         Conclusions on space shuttle program were: Sufficient technology
     existed to undertake development of fully reusable, low-operation-cost,
     earth-orbital shuttle. Number of design possibilities had been studied,
     covering range of development costs. Regardless of design chosen, as
     development costs were reduced, system recurring operating costs
     increased. In addition to reducing cost of near-space operations by
     order of magnitude, shuttle offered many opportunities for increased
     flexibility of earth resource surveys and management, space manu-
     facturing, and short-term rapid-response laboratory facilities. And
     shuttle could also be used to improve national security position. (Text)

* â€œFâ€™olitical advantages and votesâ€ were in the 50 000 jobs of space shuttle
    program, New York Times said, â€œand in the lift it would give to the
    nationâ€™s ailing aerospace industry.â€ Shuttle jobs over next four fiscal
    years would offset expected losses in jobs that would occur as Apollo
    and Skylab programs ended. â€œThus, if President Nixonâ€™s plan is
    approved, private employment under Government space contracts will
    level out during this period at not much less than its present total of
     111,000 jobs.â€ Administrationâ€™s proposed $5.5-billion shuttle invest-
    ment was to be augmented by up to $2 billion before program became
    operational in later 1980s. â€œDuring that decade, $3-billion to $4-billion
    more will probably be spent on shuttle operations-one-third of them
    for military flights-if the current plan is followed.â€ Annual shuttle
    spending would double in FY 1973 to $200 million, triple in FY 1974
    to $600 million, and reach $1 billion in FY 1975. (Lyons, NYT,

     said in theme address that key element of long-range earth survey
     program was development of machine capability to accept raw data
     from sensors in air, in space, on ground-infrared, microwave, etc.
     This level of machine capability did not yet exist. â€œWhat we will need
     are computers of a different level of sophistication that can adapt from
     their own experience and changing information needs as they digest
     continuing inputs. This work will lead, in turn, to the development of
     models of the natural world.â€ Earth resources, meteorological, and
     environmental satellite data and data relay capabilities would force
     LC
        quantum jumps necessary to create the kinds of interconnected models
     of natural and human action that will be essential in the not too
     distant future.â€ Ability to observe and measure phenomena affecting

      variety of premare igneous rocks. â€œThe bulk chemical compositions
      and textures of these rocks confirm the previous conclusions that the
      lunar maria consist of a series of extrusive volcanic rocks that are rich
      in iron and poor in sodium. The breccias contain abundant clasts of
      anorthositic fragments along with clasts of basaltic rocks much richer
      in plagioclase than the mare basalts. These two rock types also occur
      as common components in soil samples from this site. The rocks and
      soils from both the front and mare region exhibit a variety of shock

    Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in letter to New York Times,
e
      criticized interpretation of shuttle economics in Jan. 25 Times article :
      â€œNASA has a good record on cost estimating, as demonstrated by bring-
      ing in the Apollo program below the original estimates. Even if a
      contingency amount of $1 billion should be required to overcome
      unforeseen problems beyond those provided in the $5.5 billion esti-
      mates, the combined total for development and initial investment will
      be substantially below the $10 billion to $14 billion estimate in the
      Times.â€ (NYT, 2/7/72)

      Mountain Section in Boulder, Colo.: â€œA number of . . payloads
      have been flown and historical design and program cost data were
      available. We have determined by actual preliminary design, prepara-
      tion of program plans, and detailed costing analyses, that these pay-
      loads could have been redesigned to fly on the shuttle with payload

      development cost savings . . of 50% of the historical baseline. The
      studies conclude that the cost of developing payloads (the major
      portion of space program costs) can be reduced primarily as a result
      of the shuttleâ€™s ability to retrieve payloads for reuse, refurbishment
      and updating.â€
          Dichotomy of unmanned and manned space programs should not
      be perpetuated, Day said. US. needed to continue â€œvigorous and
      meaningful manned space programâ€ that did not â€œobscure the auto-
      mated satellite programs.â€ Shuttle was â€œthe one mechanism that can
      effectively support both goals in an optimum wayâ€ within national
      space budget. (Text)
    President Nixonâ€™s â€œenthusiastic supportâ€ of space shuttle had â€œpumped
      fresh breath of lifeâ€ into NASA, â€œbuoyed the spirits of a flagging
      aerospace industry and lost no friends in politically vital West Coast
      and southern states,â€ Robert Gillette said in Science article. Shuttle
      endorsed by President was â€œconsiderably less ambitious, and at least
      a billion dollars cheaper, than the shuttle NASA has fought forâ€ but
                                                  .

    now stands,â€ prospects for â€œscuttling the shuttle are slim.â€ Shuttle
    possessed few of SSTâ€™S intrinsic weaknesses. Central moral issue raised
    by the SST was â€œthe propriety of government subsidy for an essentially
    commercial enterprise.â€ Shuttle â€œhas no such commercial overtones,
    and, by any measure, it is a more truly national enterprise.â€
       Congressional attack on supersonic transport program, while largely
    based on projectâ€™s economics, had drawn strength from â€œvast and
                                                       .

    damage.â€ No such catalytic issue seemed likely to arise in shuttle
    debate. Gdlette quoted unidentified Senate aide as saying, â€œUnless we
    can pull together the kind of public campaign that brought down the
    SST, the shuttle is going to get by this year without a thorough
    examination and without an adversary hearing in Congress.â€ (Science,

  Creative science in US. was in transition state, Dr. William D. McElroy,
    National Science Foundation Director, said in Science editorial. â€œAnd
    much of the feedback associated with this fermentation is focused on
    NSF, which in this country is often equated with creative science and
    scientists.â€ Historically, NSF had devoted large portion of its resources
    to â€œpursuit of disciplinary scienceresearch and science education
    motivated solely by the intrinsic needs of a discipline or the creative
    needs of individual scientists. This kind of programming has been
    highly successful and must continue, for it is the bedrock of all
    scientific enterprise. However, there must also be a heightened aware-
    ness of the requirements placed on all science, and for this reason,
     a significant share of the total resources available to NSF in the future
    must be devoted to the social and technological needs of the nation.
    This, however, does not mean that the Foundation should be diverted
    from its earlier and historical purpose; in fact, this diversification
    should be construed as a means of strengthening that purpose.â€

    with DOD and DOT, plans a program to design and manufacture two
    STOL transports. Although these aircraft probably will be smaller than
    anticipated production models, they will suit the needs of developing
    promising STOL augmented-lift concepts, control systems, and cross-
    wind landing gear. They will be able to operate within acceptable
    noise limits to and from STOL strips about 2000 f t E610 m] long.â€
       Joint NASA-Army plan â€œshould lead to advanced helicopter and tilt-
    rotor research vehicles. Although oriented primarily toward military
    applications, the research results will apply to commercial VTOL
    transports.â€
       Advanced subsonic transports of the 1980s â€œwill incorporate most
                                               .
    of the applicable advanced technology . . with significant gains in
    productivity. A longer range, higher capacity SST [supersonic trans-
    port] would fill a need on the transatlantic routes and the longer routes
    across the Pacific. And no forecaster can discount the possibility of a
    hypersonic transport (HST) for the 1990s.â€™â€™ (A&& 1/72, 3 0 4 )

* Research scientists had been invited to submit proposals for Skylab
    experiments studying use of weightlessness, NASA announced.
    Experiments would use weightlessness in space to develop improved
    techniques for preparing biological materials and for studying crystal
    growth, solidification, and other aspects of nonorganic substances.
    One invitation was for electrophoresis-motion of charged particles
    through fluid while under influence of electrical field. Use of technique
    on ground was hampered by effects of heat convection in fluid and
     sedimentation. Second invitation was for investigations of solidification
     effects, crystal growth, and other phenomena in weightless materials,

February 2 : Mariner 9 news conference was held at NASA Hq. Spacecraft
      (launched May 31, 1971) was in 81st day in Mars orbit, had accepted
     25000 commands, and had taken about 5000 pictures. Dr. Bradford
     Smith of New Mexico State Univ. said wind-transported dust that had
     obscured early Mariner 9 photography was more widespread and
     occurred more frequently than generally had been supposed ; substan-
     tial quantities of surface dust were displaced each Martian year by local
     winds that varied with season and with specific areagraphic location;
     and large-scale atmospheric instabilities occurred, producing hemis-
     pheric and global dust storms which were seasonal but apparently did
     not occur every Martian year. Storm observed by Mariner 9 had begun
     in late September 1971, reached its peak in late October, and had
     cleared slowly until mid-December. Planet was quite clear in February.
         Mariner .9 photos included pictures of huge volcano with base 500
     km (300 mi) wide, Harold Masursky of US. Geological Survey told
                  ..
     press. â€œ. as the storm cleared we were able to establish that the dark
     spots that we saw barely sticking up through at firstâ€ were â€œthe very
     summit of Nix Olympica. This tall mountain with a complex crater at
     the top and the scalloped edges and the flat, or non-raised rims indi-
     cated to us that this was probably a multiple volcanic vent. As the
     storm continued clearing finally we could see all the way down to the
     great plains at the base of the mountain. Now this is a great volcanic
             ..
     pile . twice as big as the great volcanic pile that forms the Hawaiian
      Islands. The Hawaiian pile is about 225 kilometers [I40 miles] across
      and . . . about 9 kilometers [6 miles] high. It is the largest volcanic
      pile on the earth. It is something like 32,000 feet [9800 meters] from
     the floor of the Pacific to the top of the mountain.â€

        Mariner 9 photos of Mars had provided data which conflicted with
    data from 1969 Mariner 7 Mars probe. From 1969 photos of heavily
    cratered planet experimenters had decided that Mars was â€œa dead
    planet, very primordial . . . the product of the accumulation of the
    cosmic debris that fell in to form the planet.â€ Mariner 9 photos showed
       something very, very different indeed. . . . we can see the great volcanic
    66


    piles and because of the crispness of the edges and the lack of craters,
    we think these are geologically young . . . [and] we have a geo-
    chemically evolved planet.â€ Comparison of 1969 and 1971 photos
    showed that south polar cap regions completely covered by frost in
    1969 were only partially covered in 1971. During period when photo-
    graphed by Mariner 9 little separations had widened and solid carbon
    dioxide coverage had broken up until many dark spots showed through
    as the ice sublimated and revealed underlying dark rocks.
        Dr. Charles A. Barth of Univ. of Colorado reported that Mars
    atmosphere was primarily carbon dioxide but also contained atomic
    hydrogen and atomic oxygen. â€œThe atomic oxygen comes presumably
    from the photo-dissociation of carbon dioxide and the atomic hydrogen
    comes most probably from the photo-dissociation of water vapor.â€
    Amount of atomic hydrogen varied very little with altitude. Atomic
    hydrogen extended some 20 000 km (12 000 mi) from planet like a
    LL
       great big sphere of glowing hydrogen atoms with the spacecraft
    running around through it. Those hydrogen atoms are put there from
    photo-dissociating water vapor and because of the very low gravita-
    tional field of Mars, it is relatively easy for these atoms to escape. In
     fact, the picture that we have, is that water comes up out of the surface
                                               .
     of Mars, goes into the lower atmosphere . . [and] gets deposited in the
    polar caps; when the polar caps thaw, it is released into the atmos-
    phere.â€ Atomic hydrogen was escaping into upper atmosphere at rate
    equal to 380 cu m (100 000 gallons) of water per day. (Transcript)
  NASA was working with Dept. of Transportation (DOT) to define char-
     acteristics of clear-air turbulence (CAT) better and to develop methods
     of detecting it in flight, Flight Research Center announced. Instrumented
     B-57 aircraft-equipped with DOT prototype radiometric sensor able to
     detect CAT up to 80 km (50 mi) ahead of aircraft-was being flown
     at altitudes up to 15 000 m (50000 ft) in areas over western U.S.
     where CAT was expected. Aircraft also carried Univ. of Wyoming

0 Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, presented NASAâ€™s

    authorization request before House Committee on Science and Astro-

    gram to U S . national economy : â€œScientific knowledge, scientific
    exploration, and the practical applications of aeronautics and space
    are enormously important in their own right. But perhaps most impor-
    tant of all is the need for the United States to have a continuously
    advancing technology. To meet the pressing social problems of our
    times requires above all a sound economy operating at a high level of
     employment to generate the tax revenues required at all levels of
    government. To maintain such an economy in a competitive world,
     we must increase our productivity year after year, decade after decade.
     The only way in the long term to keep increasing our productivity is
    through advancing our technology.
        â€œI know of no other activity which has done and can do as much to
    keep the United States strong in advanced technology as NASAâ€™s      pro-
    grams in space and aeronautics.â€™â€™ Economic necessity for advanced
    technology; â€œthe direct practical benefits of space applications and
    improved aircraft, including their significance for national defense ;
             ...
     and       the human and future practical values of increased under-
     standing of the earth, sun, moon, planets, and universe-these are the

      that it fully supports President Nixonâ€™s decision to proceed with the
      development of the Space Shuttle, the keystone to the Nationâ€™s future
      in space; it continues our .major ongoing space programs; and it
      provides a 50 percent step-up in our work in aeronautics. It is realistic
      in that it supports these objectives within a fiscal year 1973 budget
      approximately equal to that of last year, and under a plan that does

       program, said: â€œThe time has come to increase the technological re-
       sources allocated to the challenges of meeting high-priority domestic
       needs.â€ Temptation â€œto cast technology in the role of ecological villain
       must be resisted-for to do so is to deprive ourselves of a vital tool

       which some applications of technology have engendered might indeed
       be rectified by turning our backs on the 20th century, but only at a
       price in privation which we do not want to pay and do not have to pay.â€™â€™
       Technology â€œmust be wisely applied so that it becomes environmentally
       self-corrective. This is the standard for which we must aim.â€
          President said he had requested in budget $23-million increase in
       research and development funds for reducing aircraft noise and addi-
       tional $88 million for development of â€œbroad spectrum of new tech-
       nologies for producing clean energy.â€ These would include â€œnew or

February 9 : President Nixon sent United States Foreign Policy for the
    1970â€™s: The Emerging Structure for Peace to Congress. Third annual
    report on U S . foreign policy analyzed world situation. Of space, Presi-
    dent said: â€œAS our astronauts have seen, the unity of the Earth is
    experienced most vividly from outer space. And conversely, seen from
    our planet, space itself is a frontier to mankind as a whole, not merely
    to individual nations. Space is, therefore, an unparalleled field for
    cooperation among nations.
       â€œAs we move into the second decade of space exploration, the US.
    is committed to work with others in space for the benefit of all man-
    kind. We are taking whatever steps can reasonably and properly be
    taken to work with other countries in the development of their space
    skills.
       â€œSpecifically, we have assured the European Space Conference that
    its member countries may obtain our assistance in launching satellites
    which are for peaceful purposes and which are consistent with inter-
    national obligations embodied in such agreements as the Outer Space
    Treaty and the arrangements for the International Telecommunications
    Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT) . We are prepared to consider such
    assistance to other interested countries. In addition, we are working
    closely with the Europeans on the concepts and design of a reusable
    space transportation system.
       â€œOver the past year, NASA has agreed with the Soviet Academy of
    Sciences to significant cooperation in specific space tasks, and in the
    exchange of information and plans concerning our respective space
    programs. We have exchanged samples of lunar soil. We are examining
    together the means to enable Soviet manned spacecraft and our own to
    rendezvous and dock in space. Joint expert groups have been meeting

      to arrange details of further collaboration in space meteorology, biol-
      ogy, and medicine, in the study of the natural environment, and in
      exploration of the moon and planets.
         â€œIn 1971, after years of negotiation in which the United States has
      played a leading role, the United Nations General Assembly approved
                                               .

          President said NASA-Soviet Academy of Sciences space cooperation
      had been among series of US.-Soviet agrements, â€œstriking both in
      their diversity and in their promise of mutual advantage.â€
          But in â€œchanged worldâ€ conditioning US. foreign policy, President
      noted â€œthe end of an indisputable US. superiority in strategic
      strength,â€ and its replacement by a strategic balance in which the US.
      and Soviet nuclear forces were comparable. U.S.S.R. had continued to
      improve its capability in â€œvirtually every category of strategic offensive
                                 ..  . Soviet strategic forces, even at current
      and defensive weapons.
      levels, have the potential of threatening our land-based ICBMS if the
      Soviets choose to make certain qualitative improvements. They have
      the necessary technological base.â€ Peopleâ€™s Republic of China was
      â€œcontinuing to develbp a strategic offensive capability. The possibility
      of accidental attacks remains.â€ President said it was wise for US. to
      begin Safeguard ABM deployment, but â€œwe may soon complete a SALT
      agreement with the USSR which will limit ABM deployment.â€
          President commended 1970 Hague and Montreal International Civil
      Aviation Organization conventions to deter aircraft hijacking and
      sabotage : â€œThese two conventions will increase the likelihood that
      hijackers, saboteurs, and persons committing other attacks against
      civil aircraft will be punished. . . . Universal ratification would ensure
      that air pirates could find no place to hide.
          bb
             We intend to press for wide adherence to these agreements and for
      continued international cooperation, including exchanges of informa-
      tion on security measures. We will also continue to urge international
      agreement to suspend air service to countries which refuse to cooperate
      in the release of hijacked aircraft and in the punishment of hijackers.â€

    supersonic-or faster.â€ US. â€œmust develop a supersonic transport or
    abdicate its enviable position as master builder of the worldâ€™s commer-

    than the one we canceled. It must be quieter, have a greater payload
    fraction, and have longer range-transpacific if possible.â€ Because of
    lost time, competition â€œwill not be the Concorde, but a follow-up super-
    Concorde of unknown characteristics.â€
        US. should â€œproceed with a sense of urgencyâ€ in developing neces-
    sary technology to produce a superior aircraft. â€œI believe that there is

  National Science Foundation submitted to President annual report Fed-
    eral Support to Universities, Colleges, and Selected Nonprofit Institu-
    tions, Fiscal Year 1970. Between FY 1969 and FY 1970, Federal funds

    $3.227 million-lowest level since 1966 and first decline in actual dol-
     lars in direct Federal support since 1963. NSF attributed much of decline
    to â€œrecent shift in Government policy away from direct Federal grants
    for facilities construction to subsidized interest charges on loans from

February I1 .- Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, refuted econom-
     ics of space shuttle opponents in speech before Commonwealth Club of
     San Francisco: â€œFirst, they inflate development costs; second, they say
     that the number of launches per year must be greatly increased before
     there are savings, which is not true; third, they incorrectly include the
     cost of payloads as part of the cost of the Shuttle. In this way, they
      reach the totally false conclusion that the Shuttle program will cost $30
     or $40 billion over the next two decades.
         â€œTheir figures are wrong, and their logic is wrong. It is against
      common sense to add the operational costs of the Shuttle to the develop-
                .
      ment costs . . . The cost of using the Shuttle to carry out a space mis-
      sion should be added to the cost of the mission. Actually we will be
      saving money, not spending money, every time we use the Shuttle for
      a space mission.â€
         Shuttle development cost would be â€œabout $6 billion to be spent over

    orbital science, Apollo 15 added as much new data as that gathered by
    the three previous missions combined.â€ Mission had marked first use
    of Lunar Rover and of orbital science experiments to collect lunar-wide
    information. Lâ€˜Thescientific returns from lunar orbit and surface have
    significantly increased our accumulated knowledge of the moon and by
    extrapolation of the data from this vacuum-packed laboratory, knowl-
    edge of the solar system, including our earth.â€
        Upon completion of Apollo program with Apollo 17 in December,
    Cbwe will have accumulated a vast treasure of lunar data. Many exciting

    scientific results have already been published; however, an adequate
    assessment of the total body of data will require scientific effort for
    years to come.
        â€œAs Apollo draws to a close, we are concentrating our activities in
    earth orbit-the primary field of manned space flight during this
    decade.â€ Skylab was â€œfirst step in this directionâ€ and â€œone of the
    most significant benefit-oriented programs of the space age.â€ Skylab
    was four times larger than Soviet Salyut spacecraft and weighed
     77 180 kg (170 000 lbs) with total 344 cu m (12 150 cu ft) pressurlzed
    volume. Skylab typified variety of activities that could be accomplished
    in space. â€œSeveral years ago we began to look at this total space
                               ..
     arena in a different way. . While we were driving toward our goal
                                                                  .
     of a manned lunar landing . . . a distinction was made . . between
    manned and unmanned flight programs.â€ Distinction â€œreally does not
    existâ€ in NASAâ€™S program for 1970s. â€œThe transition is already under-
     way in Skylab.â€
        Survey of total space activity had also led to shuttle concept. â€œWe
                                            .
     started with a fully reusable system . . using winged flyback booster
     and orbiter stages with all fuel carried in internal tanks.â€ Studies
     confirmed feasibility. Estimated development costs were close to $10
     billion, but cost per flight, at $4-1 million, â€œmade it extremely
     attractive.â€ Problem was lack of funds. NASA LLlearned    that there were
     cost advantages in using an expendable liquid hydrogen tank for the
     orbiter.â€ This became baseline with booster configuration unchanged
     except for modification. While process reduced development costs,
     expendability of tanks increased flight costs. NASA found â€œadditional
     savings could be made if we placed both the hydrogen and the oxygen
     tanks outside the orbiter.â€ In efforts to economize on booster develop-
     ment, NASA first considered â€œflyback booster incorporating F-1 engines
     and phasing orbiter systemsâ€ and later â€œunmanned ballistic boosters.â€
     Leading candidates were recoverable and reusable pressure-fed liquid-
     propellant booster and booster with solid-fueled rocket motors.
     Contractors were completing studies, and decision would be made
     shortly.
         Mathematica report of study for NASA in May 1971 had shown
     shuttle with flyback manned booster was cost-effective when averaging
     39 flights a year. Myers submitted new edition of report, incorporating
     refined data and changes in shuttle configuration, which showed
     shuttle cost effective with traffic as low as 30 flights per year.
         â€œI believe that practically all of this countryâ€™s future earth-orbital
     space activities will use the Shuttleâ€™s capability in exploiting the
     potential benefits of space and providing the taxpayer as large a
      return of his space investment as possible.â€ (Transcript)

    Technology, during hearings by House Committee on Science and
    Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology on
    FY 1973 NASA authorization, testified that recently developed NASA
    technology could have increased supersonic transportâ€™s investment
    return rate. Calculations had been made showing that â€œincorporation
    of now emerging technology for static stability augmentation and
    active flutter control could have allowed a weight savings, and thus a
    payload increase, of better than 16,000 pounds, or an additional return
    on investment of about 7.576.â€
        NASA research and technology in aerodynamics, configurations,
    materials, structures, propulsion, and avionics applicable to advanced
    long-haul transport aircraft design showed â€œreal promise.â€ Application
    of automated active control concepts â€œcould result in considerable
    weight savings by eliminating the need for inherent aerodynamic
    stability and thereby reducing the size of control surfaces. It could also
    result in reduced structural fatigue for longer life, lower structural loads
    for lighter structures, and ride quality control and active damping of
    aircraft flutter for a more comfortable ride.â€ (Transcript)

February 22: Apollo 16 press conference was held at NASA Hq. Dr.
    Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Manager, said Apollo 16 lunar
    landing site would consist of volcanic highland material. â€œThe high-
    lands which we are landing on . . . are composed of two types of units.
    One type is material formed early in lunar history and subsequently
    fragmented and redistributed by the numerous meteorite impacts which
    have scarred the lunar highlands. These units are predominantly ejecta
     deposits now. And on Apollo 15 with the genesis rock we hopefully have
                                                                       .
    sampled some of these early deposits. The second major unit . . is
    materials which have modified these early deposits by flooding them
    or building up on top of them predominantly by volcanic processes.
    The primary objective of Apollo 16 is the exploration and sampling of
    this lighter type of highland terrain with hopefully a fragment or two
     of the old original stuff brought in by impact from . . . the old original
    crust which is probably still exposed down in the lower southern
    hemisphere.â€
        Dr. M. E. Langseth of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory
    explained changes in drill design, with joints to permit core samples
    to be brought out more readily.
        Dr. H. J. Moore of US. Geological Survey described orbital science
     experiments, including photographic system to determine moonâ€™s
     geometric shape. Apollo 16 CM would also photograph floor of
     Alphonsus Crater-where Ranger 9 impacted March 24, 1965-to
    provide positive identification of Ranger 9â€™s impact.
        Apollo 16 lunar module pilot Charles M. Duke, Jr., said astronauts
     would begin lunar surface extravehicular activity (EVA) as soon after
     landing on moon as they could complete postlanding checkout. They
     would conduct 7-hr EVA, and reenter LM about 17 hrs after previous

* Dr. Rocco A. Petrone, Apollo Program Director, appraised scientific
    contributions of Apollo program in testimony during House Committee
    on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight
    hearings on NASA FY 1973 authorization bill.
       â€œ. . . Apollo 11 crew crossed over four hundred thousand kilometers
     (250,000 miles) of space to touch another planetary body. Four teams
                                                      ..
    of astronauts, from Apollos 11, 12, 14 and 15 . have now made the
    epic journey and walked the lunar surface. They have returned some
    176 kg (388 lbs.) of lunar rocks and soils for analysis in earth-based
    laboratories and have established scientific stations on the moon that
    are continuously transmitting scientific and engineering data back to
    earth.â€ Apollo data, with information expected from continued sample
    analysis and lunar data analysis in the post-Apollo period, â€œsurely
    will be of practical value to man, even helping him to cope with
    current environmental problems on earth.â€
       NASA sample analysis program had â€œrequired unprecedented advance-
    ment in instrumentation and techniques to perform multiple element
    and isotope analyses with extreme precision on minute amounts of
    sample.â€™â€™ Improved high-resolution instruments made â€œdetailed investi-
    gations of surface features and internal structure of materials.â€
       Other related important breakthroughs had been computer hardware
    and software for processing and reducing large amounts of analytical
    data in a very short time. â€œThese advances, in large part stimulated
    by NASA-funded meteorite studies, were absolutely essential, because of
                                                               .
    the scientifically unique, but limited, lunar materials. . . these high
    precision research methods can now or will soon be routinely utilized
    in industrial processes and laboratories.â€ They could also â€œbe immedi-
    ately applied to a variety of environmental and biomedical problems
    by providing the capability to check and monitor levels of pollutants and
    toxic elements in our atmosphere, water, and foods.â€
       Skylab Program Director William C. Schneider outlined programâ€™s
    progress: â€œDuring the coming fiscal year testing and checkout will be
    completed and operation of Skylab will have started. Within 2 years,
    the first Skylab . . . will have become part of history, having con-
    tributed new knowledge in many fields.â€
       Skylab offered â€œan earth observation capability never before avail-
     ableâ€™, to US. manned spacecraft. During eight-month mission, Skylab
     would fly over entire US. except Alaska, over much of Europe, all of
     Africa, Australia, China, and almost all of South America-covering
     75% of earthâ€˜s surface and passing over each point every five days.
     By end of 1971, 288 investigations requiring Skylab data had been
     submitted, 249 US. and 39 foreign. Of these, 164! had been identified
     for further study. Skylab was â€œfirst manned space flight program
     designed specifically to carry activities and equipment explicitly aimed
     at improving manâ€™s life on earth. It will contribute significantly to the
     increase of knowledge of pure science and is also an experimental
     space station; a forerunner of permanent space stations of the future.â€
     Earth-oriented sensors would test technology for synoptic surveys of
     many environmental and ecological systems. Solar and astronomical

    of solar system, universe, and near-earth space. Biomedical experi-
    ments would inform how manâ€™s well-being and ability to function were
    affected by living in space.

    in Office of Manned Space Flight, testified on $305-million FY 1973
    budget request for development, test, and mission operations in manned
    space flight research and development program: â€œThis is the first
    year in which this activity is presented as a separate item. . . .â€ With

    1970 followed several years of relative stability. Decrease in Federal
    scientists and engineers between 1969 and 1970 centered in Dept. of
    Defense, largest employer of such personnel. In 1970 DOD employed
    74400 scientists and engineers, 3% below 76000 in 1969. NASA
    decline was from 13 900 in 1969 to 13 400 in 1970. Engineers accounted
    for almost all of 1% decrease in Federal scientists and engineers from
    1969 to 1970. Figures for engineers were 84100 in 2969 and 83000
    in 1970. DOD engineers declined 3%-from 53 800 to 52 300. Largest
    decline among other agencies was at NASA and Dept. of Interior. DOD
    scientists declined from 22 200 in 1969 to 21 200 in 1970. NASA
    scientists declined from 5100 to 4800 (NSF Highlights, 2/22/72, 1)

February 22-24, 29: Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator
    for Space Science, continued testimony on FY 1973 authorization
    before House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee
    on Space Science and Applications. He announced Feb. 24 NASAâ€™s
    decision to substitute two flybys of Jupiter and Saturn for Grand Tour
    of all five outer planets.
        New plan-necessitated by budgetary restrictions and congressional
    recommendation, and endorsed by National Academy of Sciences-
    National Research Councilâ€™s Space Science Board-would launch two
    spacecraft in 1977 on trajectory that would carry them by Jupiter
    and then Saturn during rare alignment of planets. Spacecraft for
    mission would be based on Mariners developed to explore inner planets
    Mars, Venus, and Mercury. They would have large antennas for long-
    distance communication, be powered by radioisotope thermoelectric
    generators, carry more than 68 kg (153 lbs) of instrumentation includ-
    ing TV cameras, and be launched by Titan-Centaur-Burner 111 boosters
     and accelerated by Jupiterâ€™s gravity and orbital velocity for flight to
    Saturn. Possible Saturn encounters included flying close to planetâ€™s
    satellite Titan-larger than planet Mercury and only satellite known
    to have atmosphere. Spacecraft would encounter Jupiter in about 1%
    yrs and Saturn about 334 yrs after launch. Mission plan flexibility
    would permit selection of different flyby trajectory at Saturn for
     second spacecraft based on data from first. Plan would maintain option
    to use Pioneer-class spacecraft for Jupiter and Saturn orbiters in late
     1970s. Project responsibility had been assigned to Jet Propulsion
     Laboratory.
        In other testimony, Dr. Naugle said NASA had developed heat sterili-
     zation techniques for Viking lander and new thermoradiation tech-
     niques expected to have future space and industrial applications.
     Program initiated measures to ensure that all planetary missions had

    test analysis. Bed rest portion was considered analogue of weightless-
    ness. Potassium intake would be closely controlled because NASA doctors
    postulated Apollo 15 crew had not consumed enough potassium for
    their workload and adjustment to weightlessness. Program consisted of
    9-day equilibration, 7-day control phase, 12-day bed rest, and 14-day

    contract to conduct screening tests of various combustor designs and
    modifications. Contractor would consider LeRc-developed â€œswirl canâ€
    design, which provided many fuel-injection points and premixed some
    fuel and air and could be operated to temperatures twice as hot as

        Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology
     Roy P. Jackson reported â€œexcellent resultsâ€ in first acoustic tests,
     completed in November 1971, of experimental quiet engine for con-
     ventional takeoff and landing ( CTOL) aircraft. â€œIn an unsuppressed
                             .
     baseline configuration . . the noise levels were the equivalent of at
     least 3 EPNdB [epndb, effective perceived noise in decibels] lower than
     the original targets. In a first cut simulation of an acoustically sup-
     pressed nacelle which was not an optimum design, the noise levels
     were from 7 to 9 EPNdB lower yet, with aerodynamic performance
     losses no greater than expected.â€ It appeared possible to design an
     advanced version of CTOL engine â€œwhich will incorporate all the
     advances in technology and will have a more nearly optimum trade-off
     between noise reduction and installed weight penalty.â€
        In FY 1973, $2.5 million was requested for program to reduce noise
     of short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft to 95 epndb at 500 ft
      (150 m) . Tests at Flight Research Center of quieted T-34 high-bypass-

    of Defense microwave landing system (MLS) development plan to
    provide landing system for civil and military use to replace current
    very-high-frequency (VHF) landing system. NASA would provide per-
    sonnel in FAA MLS Project Office, chairmanship of the MLS Interagency
    Advisory Group, flight-test validation of the MLS for STOL operations,
    and extension of our work in FY 1973 to include CTOL and VTOL
    aircraft. â€œWe are convinced the national microwave landing system

    airport congestion relief, and, especially, safety enhancement in the
    airport area.â€
        Gerald G. Kayten, Director of Transport Experimental Program
    Office in OAST, said on Feb. 23 that NASA programs would â€œprovide a
    foundation upon which industry can base the design and development
    of the new STOL systems in the late 1 9 7 0 â€™ ~and upon which the
                                                         ~
    Government can establish criteria for certification and regulation of

     bility based on major advances in each of several technical disciplines.â€
        Albert J. Evans, Director of Military Aircraft Programs Office in
     OAST, on Feb. 24 described support of military aircraft development
     programs. NASA had assigned research engineers to F-15 and B-1
     aircraft and Air Force prototype systems program offices. â€œThis has
     put NASA â€˜on the sceneâ€™ as technical problems become recognized and

     FY 1973 â€œwith about 12,000 NASA wind tunnel hours behind it, and
     much technical consultation by NASA staff members with the Air Force
     and the industry that is developing the F-15.â€ F-15 operational engine
     would be installed at Lewis Research Center to analyze air flow through
     engine components, combustion efficiency, and performance characteris-
     tics. NASA would analyze F-15 engine and airframe performance and
     flight-test aircraft at LeRC, where similar tests would be run on Air
     Force AX aircraft in cooperation with USAF. In E 1 program, four

    NASA life sciences program â€œexemplifies the success which can be
    achieved by combining the special talents of Government, industry,

       Dr. Berry also reported there had been â€˜â€˜no findings in the manned
    space flights to date by the United States or U.S.S.R. that would
    preclude the commitment of man to longer duration missions. Therefore
     ..
      . we feel confident in committing man to a 28-day mission.â€ Apollo
    16 and 17 and Skylab experiments would study physiological response
    of body before commitment to 56-day Skylab mission.
       Philip E. Culbertson, Director of Advanced Missions in OMSF, testi-
    fied on space shuttle orbital systems and advanced missions definition
    and planning: In areas of payloads, research and applications modules
     (RAM), advanced missions, and advanced development, â€œprincipal
    effort is directed toward developing . . . understanding and planning
    the use of the shuttle.â€ In RAM program, â€œwe will be continuing the
    study of concepts of a family of payload carrier modules suitable for
    transport in the Shuttle Orbiter cargo bay.â€ Modules would range
    from â€œaustere shuttle â€˜Sortie Canâ€™ with relatively simple laboratory
    equipment . . . through more sophisticated, dedicated laboratory and
    observation facilities, including automated free-flyers serviced by the
    Shuttle.â€
       Sortie mission using orbiter as platform for short-duration experi-
    ments was among most promising shuttle operating modes. Mission
    would use advantages of shuttle in payload design, development, and
    operation, and, â€œfor the first time, permit the investigator to accom-
    pany his experiment into space.â€ Sortie missions would be modeled
    after ARC Airborne Research Program in which Convair 990 aircraft
    was used as airborne laboratory. â€œThe goal in developing procedures
    for managing the Space Shuttle Sortie Missions will be to retain the
    relatively simple, flexible and highly responsive aspects of the â€˜990â€™

February 25: U.S.S.R. launched Cosmos 475 from Plesetsk into orbit
    with 1003-km (623.2-mi) apogee, 967-km (600.9-mi) perigee, 104.8-

  Reporting on Jan. 10-13 Third Lunar Science Conference results, Science
    said â€œfar more comprehensive picture of the moon but far fewer claims
    to understand how the moon evolved were evident.â€ Conflict in geo-
    chemical evidence suggested â€œan initially cold moon in which partial
    melting of its outer layers took place and magnetic evidence that
    suggests an initially hot moon with a molten core during the early
    part of its history.â€ Other puzzles were indication that radioactive
    materials on moonâ€™s surface were concentrated in one area and evi-
    dence of unexpectedly high heat flux from moonâ€™s interior at Apollo 15
    site. Seismic evidence that moon had layered crust 65 km (40 mi)
    thick had been unexpected. More details on lunar chronology had been
    determined, â€œsuch as the date of formation of the Imbrium basin
    about 4 0 billion years ago and of the Copernicus Crater only 900
              .
    million years ago.â€ It also appeared that, â€œbecause of the initially
    high rate of meteoroid impacts on the moon, very little if any of the
    original crustal rocks have survived.â€ Lunar-sample chemistry was
    &<
       proving far from easy-the possibility that volatile elements have
                                          .
    migrated on the lunar surface . . is complicating the analysis of
    trace constituents.â€ Despite complications, â€œscientific understanding
                                                  ..
    of the moon is much further advanced than . even a year ago. The
    systematic coverage of the moonâ€™s surface provided by the orbital
    experiments on Apollo 15, in combination with the lunar samples,
    laboratory work, and the experiments on the lunar surface have pro-
    vided new data to replace what sometimes proved to be unfounded
    speculations.â€ (Hammond, Science, 2/25/72, 868-70)

  NASA announced selection of 10 scientists and their proposals for Skylab
    ground-based astronomy program to acquire corollary solar data from
    ground simultaneously with Skylab observations from earth orbit.
        In related program, ApoIIo Telescope Mount principal investigators
    had offered guest investigator opportunities to all interested astron-
    omers worldwide. Principal investigator and guest investigator would
    arrange for access to selected ATM data of mutual interest, and guest
    investigator would publish scientific paper on analysis of ATM data
    he received. Guest investigators would be approved by NASA but would
    have no automatic claim on NASA funding. Some astronomers interested
    in program had proposed that rocket and balloon flights be conducted
    in addition to ground-based observations. Acquisition of simultaneous
    solar data from many of these observations, with Skylab data, was
    expected to greatly enhance development of models of solar atmosphere.

    cantly lighter than slate-colored dust recovered by Luna 16 (Sept.
    12-24, 1970). Core material in drill tube was placed in huge cylindrical
    chamber. After chamber had been sealed, pumps produced vacuum
    and then introduced an unidentified sterilizing gas which was later

   gram and report on evolution of F-8 supercritical wing configuration.
   Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb, head of %Foot Tunnels Branch at Langley
   Research Center and developer of supercritical wing concept, com-
   mented on cortelation of wind-tunnel and flight-test results.
        Flight tests of NASA supercritical wing on TF-8A aircraft had dem-
    onstrated that new airfoil shape increased flight efficiency at speeds
    near mach 1. Since its first flight March 9, 1971, TF-8A had carried
    supercritical wing on 27 flights and had reached mach 1.2 (1274 km
    per hr; 792 mph) and 15 500-km (51 000-ft) altitude. NASA test pilot
    Thomas C. McMurtry said flight-test program had indicated that pilot-
    ing procedures and tasks at near-sonic cruise speeds should be as
    routine as present jet transport operations and that introduction of
    supercritical wing was not expected to cause any serious problems.
    Future plans for supercritical wing included addition of side fairings
    for increased area ruling, determination by simulation of effects of wing
    roughness from manufacturing imperfections, and development of plans
    for follow-on flight program3 to further the readiness of new technology
    for industry applications. (FRC Release 2-72; FRC X-Press, 2/18/72,2)

    balloons floating around world, floating ocean buoys, wild animals, and
    British Aviatrix Sheila Scott, who set several aviation records while
    circling globe in 1971. In October 1971 IRLS platform had been placed
    in buoy off Arctic ice island T3 to measure atmospheric pressure, sur-
    face and water temperatures, and, in tandem with Nimbus 4, platform
    position. In April six more buoys would be installed on ice floes in
    Arctic Ocean north of Alaska to obtain basic weather information dur-
    ing summer. Data had never before been obtained because ice islands
    melted into brackish ponds and streams covered by fog and rain and
    were impossible to reach.
        Monitoring platform in Ohio was transmitting water-quality data
    from Great Miami River near Cincinnati. IRLS platforms would also be
     attached to fixed stations in Lake Erie to monitor water oxygen con-
    tent, electrical conductivity, alkaline and acid content, and tempera-
    tures and to test efficiency of collecting water data quickly and repeti-
    tively from many different areas simultaneously. Drifting platform in

    figurations had been completely and intensively reviewed by independ-
    ent group and most previous qualifications had been verified. Estimated
    cost of responding to review board recommendations was $2 million
     for FY 1972, $3 million for FY 1973, and $5 million per year there-
     after. (Transcript)

     Manned Space Flight: In FY 1973 Manned Spacecraft Center, Marshall
     Space Flight Center, and Kennedy Space Center capabilities specializ-
     ing in project management would be â€œin the midst of a changeover as
     current programs are phasing down and the Shuttle program and re-
     lated activities are getting underway. Our laboratory and technical
     facilities will be dedicated to developing the technology for on-going

     This level is the minimum necessary for carrying out our responsibili-
     ties for Apollo, Skylab, and Space Shuttle, while still providing support
     to new technology development and planning for future missions.â€ On
     top of planned reduction of 619 positions in FY 1972 budget, Centers
     were further cut by 636 positions under Federal employment control in
     FY 1972 and 1973, or 10% loss in those two years. Added reduction
     of 361 positions in FY 1972 and 275 more positions in FY 1973 would
     require further reduction-in-force procedures and continue to con-
     tribute to aging of overall personnel complement.

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972

 Adelbert 0. Tischler, Director of Shuttle Technologies Office in NASA Office
   of Aeronautics and Space Technology ( OAST) , testified on progress of
   shuttle transportation system before House Committee on Science and
   Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on Aeronautics and Space Technology dur-
   ing NASA FY 1973 authorization hearings: â€œMethods for rapidly assess-
   ing the aero-heating and flight handling characteristics of the shuttle
   are being developed. A base for applying new design methods and for
   use of new materials in the sensitive problem of structural mass has
   been laid. Thermal protection systems, some comprising materials
   which were virtually unknown at the start of the program, will be
                ..   . technological readiness. The questions of long-lived
   brought to
   propulsive and power equipment, suitable for repeated re-use, will be
   answered.â€ Computerized index and search procedure for access to all
   published shuttle technology was nearing completion. â€œWhile technol-
   ogy issues remain, the continuing progress of the technology program
   conducted by . . . NASA centers and industrial contractors is building a
   technological base that is far deeper and stronger than that which has
   heretofore underlain new development programs. This base . . . will
   assure successful Shuttle development.â€
      David S. Gabriel, Manager of AEC-NASA Space Nuclear Systems
   Office, described NASA-funded electrophysics research program con-
   ducted by Ames, Langley, and Lewis Research Centers and Jet Propul-
   sion Laboratory. Program was concerned â€œwith understanding and,
   ultimately, using electrons, nuclei, atoms and molecules. Such work is
   of central importance to future sciences, for example, to laser beam
   generation, transmission and conversion ; superconductivity ; or plasma
   power devices.â€ In FY 1972, research had been completed on continu-
   ous-flow plasma accelerator to simulate spacecraft reentry conditions
   accurately, new contributions to understanding plasma turbulence had
   been made, knowledge of uranium plasma properties had been im-
   proved, and carbon monoxide lasers had been demonstrated to be
   highly efficient. New superconductor made up of thin films of vanadium
   and silicon had been discovered. For FY 1973 $3.4 million had been
   requested for programs in plasma dynamics, lasers, superconductivity,
   and nuclear physics.
      Roy P. Jackson, Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space
   Technology, testified that â€œclearly the space shuttle orbiter, a rather
   sophisticated piece of machinery, is not only a launch vehicle and a
   spacecraft but also a high speed airplane, with all the attendant con-
   siderations of aircraft-type control and landing. It offers NASA an op-
   portunity to apply aerodynamic, structural, and materials technology
   that has been developing over the past 10 or 15 years for high per-
   formance aircraft. Reciprocally the shuttle work offers much to benefit
   aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years.â€ NASA had also capitalized on early
   Air Force technology oriented toward manned high-speed flight in the
   atmosphere as well as reentry into the atmosphere, such as Dyna-Soar
   and X-15 projects.

   several kilowatts of power. Current research is directed primarily
   toward two types of nuclear systems, isotope systems for low power
   levels of about 1 kilowatt, and the intermediate reactor power systems
   for levels in the range of several kilowatts up to 10-20 kilowatts.â€
   Isotope systems were radioisotope thermoelectric generators ( RTGS) .
   Intermediate reactor power system consisted of zirconium hydride
   reactor to generate heat and thermoelectric power-conversion compo-
   nents to convert this heat into electricity. Program was directed toward
   reactor test in 1976-1977 period to demonstrate long-life capability.
   Stable performance had been achieved on thermoelectric converter test
   modules. Effort in FY 1973 would concentrate on verifying this per-
   formance. Conversion system would be developed for testing with the
   reactor to verify the integrated system performance. (Transcript)

 Atomic Energy Commission published Global Inventory and Distribution
    of Pu-238 from SNAP-gA, report on study of plutonium accidently
    injected into stratosphere when US. Navy Transit satellite failed to
    reach orbit after launch from Vandenberg AFB April 21, 1 9 a . Accident
    had caused threefold increase in global fallout of plutonium isotope
    over that usually injected into atmosphere by atmospheric nuclear
    weapon tests. SNAP-9A nuclear generator, designed to convert heat
    from Pu-238 into electrical energy, had burned up during reentry and
    had ablated into small particles at 46-km (28.6-mi) altitude. Concen-
    trations of Pu-238 in stratosphere had been measured through end of
    1970 and soil samples had been collected at more than 60 sites to esti-
    mate global distribution of fallout from the accident. Of the 17 kilo-
    curies of Pu-238 originally in the generator, 13.4 plus or minus 2.2
    kilocuries had been deposited, with 3.1 plus or minus 0.8 in northern
    hemisphere and 10.3 plus or minus 2.1 in southern hemisphere. Al-
    though prutonium was one of most enduring and deadly radioactive
    poisons known, amounts inhaled when Pu-238 settled to earth were so
    small they were not considered hazardous. (Text)

   ploration have been outstanding
    of many and a number of significant accomplishments, our achieve-
    ments in equal employment in NASA, here on earth, do not match what
    we have done beyond our planet.â€

   by transfer, training, promotion, and whatever other means are avail-
    able, and appropriate, our offices move toward the goal of the balanced
   staffing that will achieve true equal employment opportunities.â€
        NASA was planning to get members of minority groups into space.
    Space shuttle would be important factor in accomplishing this goal.
    NASA also would consider establishing annual awards for outstanding
    performance in Office of Equal Opportunity and would insist that â€œspirit
    as well as the letterâ€ of contractorsâ€™ equal employment obligations be
    fulfilled. (Text)

    from Eastern Test Range at 8:49 pm EST by three-stage Atlas-Centaur-
    T L M - 3 6 4 4 booster, used for first time. Spacecraft reached highest
    launch velocity ever attained, 51 500 km per hr (32 000 mph) relative
    to earth. Primary objective was to obtain precursory scientific informa-
    tion beyond Mars orbit with emphasis on investigation of interplane-
    tary medium, asteroid belt, and Jupiter and its environment. Secondary
    objective was to advance technology for long flights to outer planets.

                                                                    1
    experiments to provide new knowledge about Jupiter, solar system, and
    Milky Way galaxy. It would return first closeup images of Jupiter and
    make first measurements of Jupiterâ€™s twilight side, never seen from
    earth. Two additional experiments-celestial mechanics and S-band
    occultation-would use communication signal and earth-based equip-
    ment. Pioneer 10 would be first spacecraft to observe Asteroid Belt be-
    tween orbits of Mars and Jupiter, first man-made object to escape solar
    system, first spacecraft to use orbital velocity and gravity of Jupiter for
    escape, and first NASA spacecraft powered entirely by nuclear energy-
    four radioisotope thermoelectric generators developed by Atomic
    Energy Commission. Pioneer 10 would make 20 kinds of measurements
    of Jupiterâ€™s atmosphere, radiation belts, heat balance, magnetic field,
    moons, and other phenomena. It would also characterize solar atmos-
    phere, interstellar gas, cosmic rays, asteroids, and meteoroids.
        Spacecraft also carried pictorial plaque designed to show scientifically
    educated inhabitants of another star system-who might intercept it
    millions of years later-the time spacecraft was launched, from where,
    and by whom. Plaque design was etched into gold-anodized aluminum
    plate 15 by 23 cm (6 by 9 in) and 1.27 mm (0.05 in) thick attached
    to spacecraftâ€™s antenna support struts. Radiating lines on left of plaque
    represented positions of 14 pulsars, with mathematical binary code â€œ1-â€
    symbols representing pulsarsâ€™ frequencies relative to hydrogen atom,
    which was used as â€œuniversal clock.â€ Hydrogen atom was also used as
    (6

March 2-24: NASAâ€™s
launched with the highest velocity
yet attained and began its journey
toward the Asteroid Belt, the planet
Jupiter, and eventual escape from

had been launched, when, and by
what kind of beings. I n the photo
above, technicians adjusted the
spacecraft at TRW, Redondo Beach,
Calif., facilities.

        Initial orientation of Pioneer 10 was achieved six hours after launch
     so that communications high-gain antenna was directed toward earth.
     By March 3, four scientific instruments-magnetometer, charged parti-
     cles experiment, geiger tube telescope, and meteoroid detector-had
     been turned on. First midcourse maneuver, March 7, increased velocity
     by 14 m per sec (45.9 fps), adjusted trajectory, and shortened flight
     time to Jupiter by nine hours. At 3:OO pm EST March 8, Pioneer 10 was
     4 570 000 km (2 840 000 mi) from earth traveling at 32 800 km per
                         .
     hr (20 400 mph) Round-trip radio communication time was 31 sec.

    and 24, delayed arrival time by 2Yz hrs and moved arrival point at
    Jupiter about 6400 km (4000 mi) closer to planet. Maneuver was also
    attempt to fly Pioneer 10 behind Jupiterâ€™s moon Io. Whether flight path
   behind Io had been achieved would not be known until spacecraft
    neared Jupiter. To go behind Io, spacecraft had to arrive within period
    of less then eight minutes. By March 24 remaining instruments-plasma
    analyzer, cosmic ray telescope, imaging photopolarimeter, infrared
    radiometer, and asteroid/meteoroid detector-had been turned on and
    all experiments were recording good data. Meteoroid detector had
    recorded 10 impacts, and asteroid/meteoroid telescope had seen one
    meteoroid. Spacecraft was expected to enter Asteroid Belt in early July
    and to reach Jupiter Dec. 3, 1973.
       Pioneer 10 was first spacecraft to attempt Jupiter probe. Pioneer 5
    was launched March 11, 1960, to study heliocentric space environment
    inward toward sun. Pioneer 6 (launched Dec. 16,1965) and Pioneer 7
    (launched Aug. 17, 1966) were studying heliocentric space environ-
    ment. Pioneer 8 (launched Dec. 13, 1967) and Pioneer 9 (launched
    Nov. 8, 1968) were studying interplanetary phenomena. Last four were
    still operating satisfactorily. (NASA proj off; NASA Releases 72-25,

    Spacecraft was obtaining radio-sounder and correlative direct measure-
    ments to allow continuation and extension of ionospheric studies dur-
    ing period of declining solar activity, and long lifetime was anticipated.
       Isis 2 was fourth and final mission in US.-Canadian program to study
    ionosphere that began with launch of Alouette 1 Sept. 28, 1962. All

    reported. He had shown particles of waste water could have combined,
    orbited moon for several weeks at gradually decreasing altitudes, and
    finally descended to lunar surface, where they were detected as water
    vapor. Bellcommâ€™s findings were rejected by Dr. H. Kent Hills of Rice
    Univ., who said waste discharge would have spread out in orbit and
    would not have produced as high a reading on two suprathermal ion
    detectors as he and codiscoverer Dr. John W. Freeman had found. Dis-

    most jetports are too noisy today, the capacity increase must be accom-
    plished with an actual integrated decrease in noise. Steeper operational

    Applications during FY 1973 NASA authorization hearings. Objectives
    of program were â€œto establish useful applications of space and space
    know-how through the development of user relationships, through the
    development of requisite technology, and through the conduct of appro-
    priate ground, airborne and space flight investigations.â€
        Space was â€œa magnificent vantage point to survey the surface of the
    earth and to expedite and enhance the flow of information around the
    globe.â€ Core of program was new applications of earth observations
     and communications, but â€œother areas associated with the unique en-
    vironment of space, particularly weightlessness, show promises which
    must be explored, developed and exploited.â€ Space manufacturing
     processes offered good example. â€œSpace applications, however, should
     not be envisioned just as activities that lead to satellites or laboratories
     in space, for . . . applications relate to contributions to men and women

     testified during House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Sub-

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972

      William H. Woodward, Director of Space Propulsion and Power,
   cited importance of isotope power systems to NASA planetary program:
   â€œThe ability of nuclear electric power systems to operate for long
               .
   periods . . without consideration to distance from the sun is the pri-
   mary feature which makes nuclear systems mandatory for outer planet
   missions. This self-contained energy input characteristic also provides
   a relative insensitivity to the operating environments encountered and
   this capability may be important on many missions, e.g., lander missions
   on planetary surfaces or missions which encounter high natural radia-
   tion fields.â€ Power requirements of most missions could be satisfied
   with low-level isotope power systems using radioisotope thermoelectric
   generators (RTGS) . â€œCurrently, RTGâ€™S are scheduled for flight on
   the Pioneer Jupiter Flyby and the Mars Viking Lander missions and
   in addition, are p!anned for use in future outer planet programs.â€
       Associate Administrator for OAST Roy P. Jackson testified that solar
   energy could prove important energy resource. National Science Foun-
   dationâ€™s RANN (Research Applicable to National Needs) program had
   budgeted $4 million for solar energy investigations in FY 1973. Atomic
   Energy Commission, Dept. of Interior, and NASA were conducting in-
   house studies. Solar Energy Subcommittee had been established by Fed-
   eral Council on Science and Technology Committee on Energy Research
   and Development Goals to assess benefits to recommend R&D funds and
   programs. Subcommittee was first time solar energy had been con-
   sidered at this level of national planning. NASA was evaluating concept
    for generating electric power from solar cells in space and transmitting
   power to earth via microwave beam, which would deliver more con-
    centrated solar energy than naturally received on earthâ€™s surface.
    Collecting in space also could be continuous, rather than having to stop
    at night or in cloudy weather.
       Edwin C. Kilgore, Deputy Associate Administrator for Management,
    described OAST manpower problems and methods to alleviate them.
    Though OAST manpower applied to aeronautics had increased 90%
    since 1966, manpower for all other efforts had decreased by 56%.
   Growth in aeronautics could not be provided continuously by trans-
    ferring personnel from space projects. â€œIn the short term we will con-
    tinue to meet the increased need for aeronautics manpower by re-
    training and reassignment of personnel at the Research Centers. For the
    Ions term we have initiated a program to encourage the training of
                                                    .
    students interested in aeronautical sciences. . . we are continuing the
    cooperative NASA/university graduate research and study program
    begun in FY 1971 where faculty and students are working with the
    Research Centers.â€
       R. D. Ginter, Director of Technology Applications, testified on NASA
    and National Science Foundation cooperation in applications: NSFâ€™S
    RANN program contained â€œtwo broad areas of mutual interest: Advanced
    Technolog Applications and Environmental Systems Resources. One
    of our senior people has been assigned to focus this effort, coordinate
    task selection, and provide program management. During the next
    year we intend to expand our problem definition activity and prepare
    specific proposals for NSF consideration.â€ (Transcript)

    Academician M. D. Millionschikov said 1971 had been year of achieve-
    ment in space. Creation of â€œthe worldâ€˜s first manned orbital scientific
                                        .
    station, Salyut, was a major event. . . Exploration of the moon and the
    planets with the help of automatic space vehicles has continued.
    Recently, a magnificent space experiment was completed-the Luna-20
    automatic stationâ€™s delivery to earth of soil samples from the almost
    inaccessibleâ€™ lunar mountain region. Two automatic â€˜Marsâ€™ stations
    were created. . . . Separating from the Mars-2 station, a capsule landed
    a pennant. . . and the Mars-3 descent vehicle made the first soft landing
    on the surface of Mars. In addition to the scientific exploration of space,
    broad plans were elaborated for utilizing satellites for extra-atmosphere
    astronomy. Work began on the utilization of satellites for exploring
    natural resources in the interests of the national economy including
    geological survey work, agriculture, forestry, water economy, fishing,
    the hydro-meteorological service, and geodesy.â€ (FBIS-SOV, 3/13/72,

   slash payload costs to $2000 per 0.5 kg (1lb) , â€œthen 20 million pounds
     [9 million kg] in orbit represent a national investment of $40 billion.â€
    Shuttle development cost of $5.5 billion plus deployment and operation
    of shuttle system would cost from $11 to $16 billion. NASA estimate of
    less than $100 for lifting 0.5 kg ( 1 lb) of payload from earth to
    orbit was â€œeasily disputed.â€ Estimate of $11 billion for shuttle cost
    divided by 9 million kg amounted to $550 per 0.5 kg and not much less
    than the $700 per 0.5 kg that existing NASA launch vehicles had cost.
    Only â€œif orbital payloads can be reduced so they cost only several
    times more per pound than gold, is it meaningful to seek cheaper
    space transportation. Even then the nation ought to be asking what kind
     of space program is the space shuttle designed to support.â€ (Science,

March 5: Apollo Program Director Rocco A. Petrone, in interview
    published by Washington Post, described Apollo 16 experiment to
    determine whether moon had its own magnetic field. Apollo 16 astro-
    nauts would carry to moon a magnetic rock collected by previous
    Apollo landing to see if it changed when returned to moon. â€œWe want
    to see if the magnetism that we have found in moon rocks was not some-
    how picked up on the voyage back to earth. The whole purpose of
    this exercise is to prove the existence of a magnetic field on the moon,
    which in effect proves that the moon was once hot like the earth. Mast
    scientists believe there will be no change, that the magnetism was
    locked forever into these racks when they solidified in the moonâ€™s
    magnetic field.â€
         Astronauts would also set up magnetometer on moon and place a
    moon rock on head of instrument for instant reading of its magnetism.
    When rock was brought to earth, it would be read again for comparison
     with reading on moon. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 3/5/72, A3)

March 7: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, compared NASA FY

    session of House Committee on Appropriationsâ€™ Subcommittee on
    Department of Housing and Urban Development-Space-Science-Veterans
    hearings on FY 1973 budget: â€œWe have reconfigured our plans so that
    a substantially higher level of appropriations will not be required in
    future years to complete the programs in our FY 1973 budgetâ€ and
                                            .
    to continue â€œuseful and significant . . new projects in space science,
    exploration, and practical applications, in advanced technology, and
    in aeronautics.â€ FY 1972 program would have required NASA appro-
    priations in future years to approach $4 billion per year. Run-out
    costs to complete program as planned would have risen to $3.7 billion
    in FY 1973 and $3.95 billion in FY 1974. Revised program estimated
    run-out costs at $3.37 billion in FY 1974, $3.3 billion in FY 1975, $3.2
    billion in FY 1976, and $3.1 billion in FY 1977. NASA could â€œby prop-
    erly phasing-in the start of needed future new programs . . . hold NASA
     appropriations in future years to approximately the current total appro-
    priations level in current dollars.â€
       Previous program would have committed U S . to â€œhigher NASA
    budget in future years, or to the waste from termination of programs
    in midstream,â€ but revised plan would â€œgive the Nation a good, viable,
    and balanced program in aeronautics and space at a cost it can afford.â€
    Dr. Fletcher believed â€œrealistic long-term plan in which the Nationâ€™s
    commitment is limited to budgets of approximately the current size is
    the proper posture for NASA from the standpoint of responsible man-
     agement,â€™ and â€œshould go far in alleviating the concerns that have been
     expressed that in embarking on the new space programs of the 1970â€™s
     we are committing the Nation to a program that it cannot afford.
       â€œTO achieve this posture, we have had to make some basic changes
     in our planning and accept yet another stretch-out of the period over
     which our continuing and long-term objectives in space exploration
     and space science will be achieved.â€ Principal change has been in
     space shuttle program. Shuttle now planned would cost $5.5 billion,
     about half what configuration envisaged year before would have cost.
     Second significant change was cutback in planned program for explora-

    tion of outer planets, reducing plans to explore all five outer planets
     on Grand Tour missions in late 1970s to new focus on Jupiter and
    perhaps Saturn, with less expensive spacecraft. Third significant change
    was termination of nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application
     (NERYA) program, now including in budget request $8.5 million for
    defining with Atomic Energy Commission smaller nuclear rocket engine
    and making trade-off studies of preferred propulsion system for
    missions to distant pIanets some time in 1980s.
        Final major change was increased emphasis on aeronautics, in re-
    sponse to strong urgings of committees of Congress. (Transcript)

    testified on earth resources program during FY 1973 authorization
    hearings before House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Sub-
    committee on Space Science and Applications: Program was probably
    most significant present element of earth observations program, using
    advanced satellite and ground-based techniques. FY 1973 funding of
    $48.4 million would go for procurement (including spacecraft devel-
    opment) and flight operations, data-handling system development, and
    aircraft program already underway. Queried on pace of program,
    Mathews said NASA had â€œgood basic programâ€ that would merit
    expansion. Results from ERTS-A satellite-to be flown with high degree
    of participation by users from Government, industry, and universities-
    should show program merited extension and how it should be done.
    Mathews also cited need for regulation and control of information as
    it was gathered more nearly completely and accurately. Gathering
    information was â€œless of a problem and less of a challenge than the
    proper use of this information.â€ (Transcript)

     were described by William M. Magruder, adviser to President Nixon
     on technology, in speech before National Security Industrial Assn. in
     Washington, D.C.: â€œNature of the development base applicability of
    military programs to civil transports has been altered drastically
     since the propeller transports and early jets. Those civil transports
     enjoyed literally â€˜off -the-shelfâ€˜ engines, tires, brakes, instruments, hy-
     draulic, electrical and air conditioning systems and nearly exact
     aerodynamics and controls. The cost of a civil transport development
     project under those conditions was about one time the manufacturersâ€™
     net worth, or about $300 million. During this period, it was not
     unusual for the military to be developing as many as one or two dozen
     related bombers and transports of equal size and technology. Today,
     a single civil air transport development program, such as the l3-7â€™47,
     DC-10 or L-1011, will cost about five times the net worth of the
     manufacturers, or nearly $1.5 billion. At the same time, the Defense
     Department has only the C-5A, F-14, F-15 and B-1A in development,

    ment costs, foreign nations have noticed that it takes a family of

    twenty or thirty different models and captured 85% of the civil trans-
    port market, we now are isolated to the trijets and the B-747, while

      In second briefing, Dr. Charles A. Berry, NASA Director of Life
   &iences, explained medical problems and procedures on Apollo 15
   and changes for Apollo 16. Major concerns on Apollo 15 were cardiac
   arrhythmia-irregular      heart rhythm-and       fluid-electrolyte imbal-
   ance, with severe loss of potassium. Cardiac arrhythmia occurred
   occasionally in normal persons and frequently in college students,
   apparently as a result of fatigue from all-night studying, adrenalin
   increase from apprehension about grades, drug effect from drinking
   coffee to stay awake, and heavy workload. Fatigue, adrenalin increase,
   drug effect, and heavy workload also acted on astronauts. Fluid-
   electrolyte imbalance was dependent upon intake in food and drink and
   output in breath, sweat, and body wastes. In space, balance was af-
   fected by weightlessness, acceleration, 100%-oxygen atmosphere, ab-
   normal work-rest cycle, and sustained work loads. Countermeasures
   that could be taken were better control of intake, supplementing elec-
   trolytes with intravenous fluids, coordinating exercise, providing lower
   body negative pressure, and optimizing work-rest cycles.
      Medical objectives â‚¬or Apollo 16 were essentially same as for
   ApoZZo 15: to ensure crew safety medically, to improve probability
   of mission success by providing necessary medical information, and to
   detect and understand changes incident to space flight and learn more
   about effects of space flight on man. To improve medical wellbeing of
   Apollo 16 astronauts, 72-hr preflight controlled-diet period would
   determine amount of potassium needed by each crew member. Since
   potassium could not be preloaded, small amounts of extra potassium
   would be given in daily diet in flight to ensure adequacy. In addition
   to regular preflight cardiovascular examination, x-rays of astronautsâ€™
   hearts would be taken before and after mission to determine whether
   heart size decreased during flight. Skylab equipment would be used in
   flight for electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electro-oculo-
   gram. Other inflight medical changes were daily sample of improved
   electrocardiogram data, option to alter bioharness wearing schedule,
   expansion of crew status report, high-potassium diets with potassium-
   enriched beverages and snack supplements, measurement of food and
   fluid intake and urine and fecal output, return to earth of urine and
   fecal samples for analysis, and provision of anti-arrhythmic drugs
   lidocaine, procainamide, and atropine.

March 14: President Nixon transmitted to Congress Aeronautics and
    Space Report of the President: 1971 Activities. In transmission mes-
    sage President said: â€œAided by the improvements we have made in
    mobility, our explorers on the moon last summer produced new, excit-
    ing and useful evidence on the structure and origin of the moon.
    Several phenomena which they uncovered are now under study. Our
    unmanned nearby observation of Mars is similarly valuable and sig-
    nificant for the advancement of science. During 1971, we gave added
    emphasis to aeronautics activities which contribute substantially to
    improved travel conditions, safety and security, and we gained increas-
    ing recognition that space and aeronautical research serves in many
    ways to keep us in the forefront of manâ€™s technological achievements.
    There can be little doubt that the investments we are now making in
    exploration of the unknown are but a prelude to the accomplishments
    of mankind in future generations.â€
        Report said U.S. was â€œproceeding into this decade with clearly
    defined goals and objectives for its civilian space program.â€™â€™ U.S.
    continued to invest â€œsubstantial resourcesâ€™â€™ in space activities because
     of â€œnational thrust to explore the unknown, the desire to acquire new
    knowledge, and the realization that space activity has practical and
    widely beneficial applications. Space is increasingly coming to be seen
    as an arena of human activity, rather than national activity, and there-
    fore a particularly congenial focus for cooperative undertakings that
     bring the people of the world together.â€ (CR, 3/14/72, 53885; Text)

     and the Congress have been grappling with questions on the course the

    plan is, I believe, more realistic and will give the Nation a good,

    can afford.â€
       Dr. George M. Low, Deputy Administrator, reported substantial
    progress in two basic cooperative activities with U.S.S.R.-joint     work
    on compatible docking systems and exchanges in scientific areas, in-
    cluding lunar sample exchanges. In response to question, Dr. Low said
    he thought it likely U.S.S.R. would continue lunar program after U.S.
    completed Apollo program. â€œThey may even try to land men on the
    moon in the latter part of this decade. That will be a catching-up
    process.â€
       To further question, Dr. Fletcher said that in late 1970s U.S.S.R.
    would be â€œdoing things in the manned space program that are beyond
    what we would be able to do.â€ From end of Skylab in 1973 until 1978,
    â€œit is likely that they will be carrying on some important activity and
    we will have no opportunity to respond until 1978â€ [with space shut-
    tle].
       Richard C. McCurdy, Associate Administrator for Organization and
    Management, submitted statement on NASAâ€™s      work force : â€œWhen several
    reductions are made serially, as they have been in NASA over the past
    several years, the effects compound, and the healing processes, such
    as the resumption of hiring of younger people, the filling of vacancies
                           ..   . do not have an opportunity to function.â€
    via merit promotion
    NASA was â€œfeeling these disadvantageous effects severely.â€ Most worry-
    ing was â€œdwindling of the supply of new blood.â€ It was obvious â€œtrend
    cannot continue without the health and vigor of the organization being
    undermined.â€ NASA needed â€œto embark upon a period of stabilityâ€ in
    work force to â€œreturn to normal personnel development practices, heal
    the damage of the past several years, and be prepared to meet the chal-
     lenges of the 70â€™s.â€ With the â€œprospect of a period of relative stability
     in the general level of spendingâ€ and â€œclearer view of the NASA forward
    mission,â€ such a policy was indicated.
        Statement submitted by Daniel J. Harnett, Assistant Administrator
     for Industry Affairs and Technology Utilization, described NASA
     Regional Dissemination Centersâ€™ assistance to users â€œranging from
     small businesses to the largest companies in our Nationâ€™s economy-
     across a broad spectrum of business sectors including manufacturing
     services, transportation and communications. The Centers also serve
     university faculty and students ; varied national, state, and local orga-
     nizations; and governmental entities at all levels.â€ NASA RDCS had
     served more than 2000 organizations in 1971, of which over 48% of
     industrial users were small businesses.
        M/G Robert H. Curtin (USAF, Ret.) , NASA Director of Facilities, sub-
     mitted statement on facilities. In $77.3-million FY 1973 request for
     construction of facilities, $27.9 million was for modifications and
     additions to facilities for space shuttle, $11.2 million for facilities
     supporting scientific investigations in space, $12.9 million for facilities
     supporting aeronautical research and technology, and $25.3 million for
     smaller supporting activities and planning and design. (Transcript)

  Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, Vice President and Group Executive of General
    Electric Co. and former NASA Administrator, delivered 1972 Tizard
    Memorial Lecture at Westminster School in London. Discussing manâ€™s
    future in space, Dr. Fâ€™aine evaluated role of applications satellites:
    Their â€œgreat economic and social valueâ€ was apparent â€œalthough their
    full potential is not yet appreciated. Men on every continent regularly
    use these services today; shares can be bought in the enterprises that
    provide them. We must not, however, overlook the equal value of the
    new information about the earthâ€˜s origin, history, environment, and
    destiny that our more basic lunar and planetary scientific programs
    are providing. Already studies of radiative energy transport in the
    atmosphere of Mars have contributed to terrestrial meteorology ; lunar
    geological surveys have provided new clues to the early formation and
    structure of earth. The line between science and application in this
    rapidly advancing area is continually shifting and new scientific under-
    standing of such questions as the origin of the Ice Ages might be of
    incalculable human importance.â€ (Text)

0 Decision that space shuttle booster stage would be powered by recover-

    able, reusable, solid-fueled rocket motors in parallel burn configuration,
    rather than by pressure-fed liquid-fueled rocket motor, was announced
    by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, to Senate Committee on
    Aeronautical and Space Sciences during N 1973 authorization hear-
    ings. Announcement was also released to press during morning and
    Dr. Fletcher held press conference in afternoon. Dr. Fletcher said both
    solid- and liquid-fueled boosters had been found technically feasible
    but â€œchoice was made in favor of the solid parallel burn because of
    the Iower development cost and the lower technical risks. Cost estimate
    for shuttle development was now $5.15 billion instead of earlier $5.5-
    billion estimate. Request for proposals would be issued about March 17.
    NASA expected to select shuttle launch and landing site shortly. At press
    conference he said: â€œI think we have made the right decision at the
    right time. And I think it is the right price.â€ Dr. Fletcher said it was
    likely NASA would want to launch and land at same coastal site and
    possibly from sites on both coasts. Inland sites were unlikely because
     of requirement for booster recoverability.
        Dale D. Myers, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight,
    said at conference there would be eight-week response time to request
    for proposals to become prime contractor for shuttle development.
     NASA would evaluate proposals in another eight weeks and would be
     ready for choice of contractor in early July. Requirements had been
     developed jointly with Air Force and â€œwe have a shuttle that meets the
     userâ€™s requirements, both in NASA and in the Air Force.â€
        Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, estimated break-
     down of 580 shuttle flights projected over 12-yr period for newsmen.
     Out of 100% of missions, 26% would be manned or man-tended,
     74% unmanned. Of that 7493, 27% would be â‚¬or applications (includ-
     ing NASA and other agencies or commercial applications), 25% for
     science, and 22% for Dept. of Defense missions. (Hearings transcript;

     surface by astronauts, would be â€œfirst attempt to evaluate the Moon as
     a platform from which to make future celestial observations.â€ Second

      for related uses of satellite systems would be expected to join forces.
      FCC spokesman said proposals for satellite use might ultimately be
      grouped into as many as four independent systems, each requiring its
      own satellite. Cost of complete system was estimated at $60 million to
      $100 million. Satellites would cost between $11 million and $26 million.

March 16: President Nixon praised ability of Americans to Lâ€˜harnessthe
    discoveries of science in the service of manâ€ in message to Congress
    on science and technology: â€œThey have found a way of preventing
    polio, placed men on the moon, and sent television pictures across the
    oceans.â€ But, â€œwhen other countries are rapidly moving upward on
    the scientific and technological ladder, challenging us both in intellec-
    tual and in economic terms,â€ US. position in aircraft, steel, automo-
    bile, and shipbuilding industries â€œis not as strong as it once was. A
    better performance is essential to both the health of our domestic
    economy and our leadership position abroad.â€ US. should â€œcombine
    the genius of invention with the skills of entrepreneurship, manage-
    ment, marketing and finance;â€ ensure favorable environment for
    technological innovation ; realize â€œthat mere development of a new
    idea does not necessarily mean that it can or should be put into im-
    mediate use; â€ encourage young people to become â€œdedicated scientists
    and engineers;â€ continue priority assigned to basic research and to
    â€œexploratory experiments which provide the new ideas on which our
    edifice of technological accomplishment rests ;â€ and Lâ€˜appreciatethat
    the progress we seek requires a new partnership in science and tech-
    nology-one which brings together the Federal Government, private
    enterprise, State and local governments, and our universities and re-
    search centers in a coordinated, cooperative effort to serve the national
    interest.â€
       President had increased FY 1973 Dept. of Defense budget to â€œensure
    our strategic deterrent capability, continue the modernization of our
    Armed Forces, and strengthen the overall technological base that under-
    lies future military systems.â€
       To â€œapply our scientific resources in meeting civilian needs,â€ Presi-
    dent had developed â€œoverall strategic approach in the allocation of
    Federal scientific and technological resources.â€ He urged Congress to
    support new strategy that included reorientation of space program â€œto
    focus on domestic needs-such        as communications, weather fore-

    lower COS~S.â€
        President also advocated â€œproviding new sources of energy without
    pollution;â€ developing â€œfast, safe, pyllution-free transportation;â€ re-
    ducing losses from natural disasters; mproving programs to curb drug
    abuse ; increasing biomedical research; providing better health care ;
    and drawing more directly on â€œcapabilities of our high technology
    agenciesâ€-NASA,     Atomic Energy Commission, and National Bureau
    of Standards-in applying R&D to domestic problems.
        To improve â€œclimate for innovationâ€™â€™ President had proposed Na-
    tional Science Foundation support of â€œassessments and studies focused
       .
    . . on barriers to technological innovation and on the consequences of
    adopting alternative Federal policies which would reduce or eliminate
    these barriers.â€ Additionally he would â€œsubmit legislation to encourage
    the development of the small, high technology firmsâ€ and â€œprovide
    additional means for the Small Business Investment Companies
     (SBICS) to improve the availability of venture capital to such firms.â€
        Among â€œcooperative international effortsâ€ in science and technology
    President cited exchange of lunar samples with U.S.S.R. and explora-
    tion of â€œprospects for closer cooperation in satellite meteorology, in
    remote sensing of the environment, and in space medicine. Beyond
    this, joint working groups have verified the technical feasibility of a
     docking mission between a SALYUT Station and an Apollo spacecraft.â€

  NASA officials testified before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and
     Space Sciences during FY 1973 NASA authorization hearings.
        Roy P. Jackson, NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and
     Space Technology, presented program request with increased emphasis
     on technology for â€œsolving urgent domestic civil air transportation
     problems of noise and congestion,â€ continuing concern for â€œrapidly
     growing foreign competitionâ€™â€™ to US. leadership in world aircraft
     markets, greater attention to â€œcountering the erosion of this Nationâ€™s
     preeminence in military aeronautics,â€ phase-over in space shuttle
     technology from exploratory activities to development support, con-
     tinuing focus on space technology for advanced earth-orbit systems and
     outer planet exploration, change in emphasis from development of
     large nuclear rocket to continuing the technology base for nuclear
     propulsion, with focus on small high-energy system. Budget also in-
     cluded continuing reduction of research staff and emphasis on up-
     grading existing facilities, with no new facilities requested.
         In aeronautics, advanced system studies in FY 1971 and FY 1972
     had examined application to new subsonic and sonic aircraft designs
     of projected advances in aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, con-
     trols, and avionics; identified technology advances offering greatest
     economic and competitive position benefits; and defined actions to
      â€œbring the advanced technologies to a state of readiness for industry
     utilization by the late 1970s.â€ Follow-on studies would be conducted in
      FY 1973 on â€œadditional noise alleviation possibilities and on terminal
     compatibility.â€ Application of supercritical aerodynamics and con-
      figuration treatment, engine noise and emission suppression techniques,
      composite structures, and use of active control systems â€œwere shown
      to result in a quieter, safer, more economical subsonic/sonic transport

    In N 1973 â€œaerodynamics effort will concentrate on refinements of
    supercritical wing and related configuration treatment for transport
    concepts capable of increased flight efficiency.â€
       David S. Gabriel, Manager of AEC-NASA Space Nuclear Systems Of-
    fice, testified on officeâ€™s on-going work after termination of nuclear
    engine for rocket vehicle application (NERVA) program June 30, 1972:
    â€œTO reach the outer planets in reasonably short trip times during the
    1980â€™s requires more advanced propulsion systems than are currently
    available. Among the candidate propulsion systems for these missions
    is a small, approximately 15,000-pound-thrust [66 720-newton-thrust]
    nuclear rocket engine, more suited to these unmanned outer planet
    missions than the large NERVA engine. Other candidates include high-
    performance chemical rockets and solar-and-nuclear-electric propul-
    sion.
       â€œFor the balance of this fiscal year and during the next, we will
    compare . . . candidate propulsion systems for a variety of future po-
    tential missions of the 1980â€™s and 1990â€™s including the outer planet
    exploration missions.â€ (Transcript)
  Dr. John E. Naugle, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Sciences,
    reviewed space science program before Senate Committee on Aero-
    nautical and Space Sciences during FY 1973 authorization hearings :
    Major accomplishment in astronomy in 1971 had been mapping of
    universe at x-ray wavelengths with first x-ray astronomy satellite,
    Explorer 42 (Uhuru, launched Dee. 12, 1970). Two dozen scientific
    articles had been published on observations by satellite; 116 objects
    emitting x-rays had been studied and positions accurately determined.
    Analysis of rocket data on one object indicated diameter was less than
    20 km (13 mi), yet it emitted much larger amount of x-radiation than
    did sun. â€œThe discovery of such X-ray sources is of fundamental im-
                                               ..
    portance because matter in ordinary states . cannot account for such
    intense radiation.â€
       In 1971 NASA had launched eight missions in physics and astronomy
    program. Most important was Orbiting Solar Observatory Us0 7
     (launched Sept. 29, 1971), â€œwhich carried into orbit a set of solar
    telescopes more powerful than any launched before. One instrument-
    a coronagraph-revealed visible evidence of three luminous jets of
    intensely hot solar plasma being hurled out into space at a speed of
    more than two million miles per hour [some 3 million km per hr].
    These luminous jets were 20 times the size of the earth, and represented
    the energy of 100 million atomic bombs. A peak temperature of 30
                                                                 .
    million degrees must have been attained in this event. Again . . matter
    must have been produced on a scale man cannot produce on earth.â€
       International cooperation continued major role in space science
    program; five of eight 1971 missions had had significant international
    participation.
       During year experiments and prime contractor, TRW Inc., had been
    selected for â€œnewest and most significant program in astronomyâ€-High
    Energy Astronomy Observatory, designed to â€œunlock some of the most
    profound and puzzling secrets of modern physics.â€ Pulsars and quasars
    had given evidence of new concept of energy generation that produced
    power at levels unexplainable by modern nuclear physics. (Transcript)

a
    March 16,â€™1962.
        Cosmos satellitesâ€™ wide variety of functions were described in Trud
    by Soviet engineer T. Borisov.. Primary objectives of Cosmos program
    -which had included almost 500 spacecraft-were â€œprofound and
    comprehensive scientific investigations of circumterrestrial spaceâ€ and
    earth, improvement of space vehicles, and application of experiments
    â€œconnected with the extensive use of space for national economic and
                                                                          ..
    cultural purposes. Very appreciable results have been achieved in .
    the historically short span of 10 years.â€ Cosmos satellites had studied
    circumterrestrial plasma and its interconnection with earthâ€˜s magnetic
    field, previously unknown dynamics of processes in upper atmosphere
    and space, and relationship between sun and earth. â€œCosmos-261 and
    Cosmos-348 explored the plasma ocean. Cosmos-166, which spent a
    long time patrolling the sun, made a careful survey of the solar disc.
    Cosmos-92 and Cosmos-149 could be described as modern geophysical
    laboratories. The astronomersâ€™ automatic laboratory Cosmos-215 had
    eight telescopes on board to observe hot stars in visible and ultra-
    violet rays. It also had an X-ray telescope and two photometers to
    record solar radiation dispersed by the earthâ€˜s upper atmosphere.â€
        Series had also contributed to â€œthe further improvement of space
    technologyâ€ and led to creation of first orbital station. â€œIt was only
    after testing all the complex mechanical, electrical, and radio engineer-
    ing systems and installations, and after two Cosmos satellite automatic
    dockings that the way was opened to Soyuz . . . and Salyut. The Cosmos
    satellites have tested many systems, units and assemblies of lunar and
                                           .
    interplanetary automatic apparatuses. . . the thermoregulating system
    assemblies, the solar batteries, means of communication, and many
    scientific instruments for the Luna, Venera, Zond, and Mars ap-
    paratuses were created on the basis of or having regard to experience
    gained in the operation of similar installations in Cosmos satellites.â€

    hearings on FY 1973 NASA authorization: Requested $700.8 million was
    decrease of $26.5 million from FY 1972. Ceiling of 26850 was pro-
    posed for Civil Service component of NASA in-house work force, 1500
    lower than original 1972 ceiling-bringing total reduction since 1968
    peak to 8300 positions, or 25%.
       NASA had planned to achieve 1973 ceiling by normal attrition, but
    rate of attrition was running 22% lower than required and Center
    directors had been instructed to use reduction-in-force procedures as
    necessary to reach ceilings.

    Roughly one half was for research and technology attacking noise
    generation and noise propagation; $12.4 million. was for programs for
    near-term relief from jet aircraft noise. Of the $12.4 million, $9 million
    was requested for engine-modification development program and $3.4
    million for development of operational procedures for noise abatement.

   did not announce space mission dates â€œbecause we donâ€™t want to bind
   the people who are preparing the flight.â€ Cosmonaut flight training
   areas were closed to most visitors â€œbecause we just donâ€™t want journal-
   ists to interfere with the working atmosphere of the cosmonauts.â€ Area
   contained medical center with centrifuge that cosmonauts called
   â€œDevilâ€™s merry-go-round.â€
      From size and number of apartment buildings, Wilford estimated
   Star City population at 1500 to 2000. City was â€œsmaller than Houston
   space center because it does not also serve as the mission control com-
   plex and apparently has no primary responsibility for the management
   of spacecraft design and development.â€ Like NASA Manned Spacecraft
   Center at Houston, Star City contained facilities for premission training
   of cosmonauts and postmission physical examinations and recreation.
   Like U S . astronauts, Soviet cosmonauts were trained in aircraft â€œthat
   make deep dives to simulate weightlessness.â€ Parachuting tested ability
   to handle high-stress situations. First simulator for Salyut orbiting
   laboratory was being installed in new building to be completed at
   yearâ€™s end. Wilford said that â€œthis could mean that no major advance
   beyond the present version of Salyut should be expected until well after
   the simulator is ready.â€
       Of about 50 cosmonauts in Soviet space program, one third were
   civil engineers living in Moscow, Shatalov said; remainder were Soviet
    air force pilots who lived in Star City. No women were preparing for
   space missions but U.S.S.R. had â€œmany women who specialize in
   meteorology and medicine, which are professions necessary on the
   orbital stations.â€
       From descriptions by Shatalov and Cosmonaut-engineer Aleksey S.
   Yeliseyev, Wilford had constructed outline of preparations for Soviet
    space mission: Cosmonauts were assigned to mission one year in ad-
   vance of launch date by commission of medical and engineering experts
    and Shatalov. There were two backup crews. After learning spacecraft
    mechanics and electronics and practicing in spacecraft simulator at
    Star City, crew went to Baykonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan three
    weeks before launch. There they completed training in actual space-
   craft, checked instruments, stocked food, adjusted couches, and recom-
   mended minor changes in housekeeping. â€œUnlike Cape Kennedy,â€
   Baykonur had no simulators for last-minute practice. For two days
   before launch, â€œafter the state commission approves the spaceshipâ€™s
    readiness,â€ crew relaxed. On launch morning cosmonauts were exam-
    ined physically and biomedical sensors were attached to their bodies
    before they donned spacesuits. Traditionally, cosmonauts then gathered
    in quarters for few moments of silence broken by shouts of â€œoff we
    go!â€ They signed their names on door before leaving for launch pad.
   Between missions, cosmonauts were expected to devote time each month
   to â€œsocial workâ€-visits to schools, collective farms, and factories.
       Shatalov had suggested that new Soviet manned missions were pos-
    sible within months and that U.S.S.R. was studying mission longevity
   in preparation for earth-orbiting laboratories. Of next Salyut mission,
                                                    ..   . . We will prolong

    part-time scientists and engineers in January 1971, 6% per year in-
    crease from January 1969. Annual increase rate had been 8% 1965-
    1969. Current and capital expenditures for science and engineering
    totaled $7.9 billion in 1970, 6% increase per year over 1968. Annual
    increase rate had been 15% 1964-1968. In constant dollar terms based
    on Gross National Product, 1968-1970 increase averaged only 1%per
    year, while 1964-1968 rate of growth averaged 12% per year. Annual
    growth rate of 6% in expenditures for scientific and engineering

     Dr. Ed Barker described finding, by examining Martian light through
    272-cm ( 107-in) telescope at MacDonald Observatory, of average of
     one tenth of one percent oxygen in Martian atmosphere. Since earth
     atmosphere contained about 10000 times that amount, Dr. Barker
     concluded that â€œthere is not enough oxygen in the Martian atmosphere
     to sustain human life, but I canâ€™t rule out a bacterial type of life.â€

* Soviet scientists V. Moroz and L. Ksanfomaliti described in Zzvestia
    findings on Mars atmosphere from Mars 2 and 3 spacecraft. Difference
    in contrast on two wavelengths between continents and seas during
    dust storm and change in contrast in same field had permitted evalua-
    tion of dust particle size and cloud thickness. Average radius of par-
    ticles over Iapigya region Dee. 15, 1971, was estimated to be less than
    one micrometer and density of particles to be 100 million per sq cm
     (645 million per sq in). â€œIf clouds of such density uniformly envelop
    the entire planet, its atmosphere must have contained several thousand
    million tons of dust.â€ Estimates suggested that particles have mostly
    silicate composition, â€œwhich agrees with the infra-red spectra obtained
                                                  .
    by Mariner 9. Particles of such a tiny size . . fall very slowly-for
     about a month even in the absence of supporting vertical currents in
    the atmosphere. Hence the conclusion that no prolonged storm in the
    true sense of the word, i.e. constant winds in the period of investiga-
    tion, occurred.â€ Unlike Venus, where cloud layer and atmosphere were
    more pervious and created â€œhothouse effect,â€ surface of Mars â€œgets
     cool rather than heated, giving rise to what may be described as an
    â€˜anti-hothouse effect.â€™ When the storm ended, the temperature rose.â€
    Water vapor content of atmosphere was low during and after the dust
    storm (Tass, FBIS-SOV,3/22/72, L1)

    including remote and sparsely populated regions. Several . channels
    could be available for educational and instructional use. There are

    to achieve college degrees while spending only a small           time in
    academic residence.â€ Improved systems would â€œpermit an increase in
    the number of people who could receive actual pre-school training and
    training in early-childhood education and health-care practices.â€
       Health care could be improved and costs reduced through broad
    public access to health-care services and information, while centralized
    health-record-keeping could aid hospital personnel, administrators, and
    private physicians. Two-way television teleconferences between health
    professionals could become possible. In law enforcement, â€œfingerprints
    and other criminal records and data could be almost instantaneously
    available anywhere in the country, and television conferencing could
    make possible the remote taking of testimony as well as remote iden-
    tification procedures.â€ Postal service would improve â€œwith the advent
    of electronic mail handling. Satellite links may be expected to carry a
    majority of the long distance letter mail, making inexpensive overnight
    delivery possible to all but the most remote locations. New satellite
    systems for aviation and maritime tr&c management will reduce the
    accident rate and increase the efficiency of transoceanic and coastal
    transportation of goods and people.
       NASA Deep Space Network support of Mariner 9 mission (launched

    30 to insertion into its egg-shaped orbit around Mars on November 13
    and continuing during orbital operations around Mars, Mariner 9 has
    been monitored and controlled by the deep space network. The naviga-

  Langley Research Center awarded 31-mo, $4 128 860 contract to Univ.
    of Iowa for design, construction, integration, test, and launch support
    for Injun-F spacecraft and onboard experiments. Injun-F would be
    launched from Western Test Range by Scout booster in 1974 to study
    interaction of solar winds with geomagnetosphere at large radial dis-
    tances over earthâ€™s north polar cap. Orbit would be highly elliptical
    and would traverse an area of space not previously surveyed. Space-
    craft would weigh 27 kg (60 lbs) and would carry three principal
    experiments : magnetometer to map geomagnetic field over polar caps,
    low-energy proton electron differential energy analyzer to provide
    data on population density of charged particles, and extremely-low-
    frequency and very-low-frequency ( ELF-VLF) experiment to determine
    nature of electrostatic and electromagnetic fields. Experiments might
    lead to understanding of way in which natural radiation belts sur-

    development during hearings on NASA FY 1973 authorization: â€œI
    firmly believe that the US. must retain a strong national commitment
    to scientific and technological progress. The NASA space program is a
    vital element of this overall effort.â€
       In space area, DOD was â€œbecoming increasingly dependent on space
                             ..
    systems, particularly in . communications. Other agencies and the
    public are becoming increasingly dependent on the use of space for
    communications, weather forecasting, and natural resource exploration.
    The Department of Defense supports the NASA space shuttle as an
    important part of the Presidentâ€™s program, which will lead to a greater
    and more effective use of the space environment in the future.â€
       Dr. Foster discussed Defense Satellite Communications System
     (DSCS) for military needs not satisfied economically and reliably by
    more traditional communications systems. First DSCS, currently opera-
    tional, employed â€œsimple, low-power satellites and ground terminals
    originally designed for experimental and test programs. To replace
                           ..
    the existing satellites . we are deploying new DSCS satellites that

      first week in June had been recorded March 22 and 23 and science
      instruments would be turned off March 30. From April 2 to June 4
      Mariner 9 would pass through Mars shadow once during each orbit
      for periods of up to 100 sec, during which spacecraft would operate on

 0 Future    need for public administrators who understpod science and
      technology was forecast by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator,
      in speech before American Society of Public Administrators in New
      York. Sociological and technological components of world problems
      raised problems to â€œnew level of complexity.â€
         Management and public administration teams were examining â€œsuc-
      cessful conduct of the Apollo program-the most complicated and
      difficult technical task ever undertaken by man.â€ However, â€œin Apollo
      we were carrying out a highly complex, but basically technical program.
      Essentially we were dealing with machines, not people.â€
         Asked if US. should use Apollo program approach to solve envi-
      ronmental problems, ApoZZo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman had told
       interviewer: â€œI donâ€™t think that I would care to live in a country that

    problems.â€
       Dr. Fletcher agreed â€œour Science-Administrator needs for the future
    should not be equated with needs for better technical program mana-
    gers, although this too will become increasingly important. In devel-
    oping and formulating wise and sound policies and programs to tackle

* U.S.S.R.â€™s Cosmos 476 (launched March 1 ) was believed by US. military
    and space experts to be a new-generation electronic-intelligence satel-
    lite, Associated Press reported. Cosmos 476 payload was estimated at
    between 4500 and 5400 kg (10 000 and 12 000 lbs) , about 10 times
    heavier than earlier generation ferrets designed to eavesdrop on other
    nationsâ€™ radio traffic and to monitor radar. Heavier weight suggested
    Cosmos 476 incorporated much more equipment that was probably
    more technically sophisticated. (W Star, 3/24/72, A5)

* Short-haul transportation was â€œessential to a complete national trans-
    portation system,â€ Aerospace Industries Assn. executive Jean ROSS
    Howard said in speech before STOL [short takeoff and landing air-
    craft] Seminar sponsored by Aviation Committee of St. Louis, Mo.,
    Chamber of Commerce and St. Louis Research Council. Although 70%
    of US. travel market was composed of distances up to 800 km (500
    mi) , air transportation system as yet was not oriented in this direction.
    Survey had shown that 30% of US. air passengers traveled less than
    500 km (300 mi). Air congestion delays, caused by lack of airport
    capacity, cost airlines $180 million each year and figure would increase
    to $1 billion by 1981. NASAâ€™s   $lOO-million program to develop short-
    haul, short takeoff and landing airliner was â€œwelcome recognition
    of the urgent requirement for more efficient and convenient short-haul
    air service.â€ (Text)

March 28: Space leaders endorsed shuttle in supplement published by

    design, lower manufacturin cost, remedy malfunctions in orbit, and
    afford a built-in versatility t at will alter the nature of space planning
    and operations in major ways.â€ Editorial writer had described shuttleâ€™s
    impact on space program as transition from dramatics of a countdown
    to an airport routine, Dr. Fletcher said. â€œThe dramatics will be fondly
    remembered by many of us, but nostalgia will not obscure the hard

    fact that the routine and economic access to space, of which the shuttle
    is the hinge pin, is the practical and commonsense means by which we
    shall reap the great harvest of benefits that space holds for mankind.â€
        Supplement interview quoted Dr. Wernher von Braun, NASA Deputy
   Associate Administrator for Planning, as eagerly looking forward to
    shuttle flight. â€œBy the time the first passenger shuttle flies Iâ€™ll be 68. I
    think flying into space in a shuttle will be just like being a passenger
    in an airliner, only smoother.â€ Dr. von Braun foresaw use of shuttle
    for travel to Mars â€œprobably around 1990, or at least before the end
    of the 20th Century.â€ Flight probably would begin with Mars space-
    craft being hauled, piece by piece, in space shuttle cargo bays, to be
    assembled in orbit. â€œI think the only way to fly to Mars is with nuclear
    power, and because we would never want to ignite a nuclear rock on
    earth, weâ€™ll have to begin the journey from orbit.â€ Dr. von Braun saw
    shuttle preparing way for manned exploration by ferrying small, un-
    manned spacecraft into orbit and launching them toward Mars in
    late 1970s and 1980s.
        Article by Rep. James W. Symington (D-Mo.), member of House
    Committee on Science and Astronautics, said shuttle offered oppor-
    tunity â€œnot only to the United States to advance its own aerospace
    science and technology, but also to countries which could not finance
    a complete shuttle system. The advantages will be mutual and conducive
    to needed international scientific cooperation.â€ Proper use of shuttle
    66
       can help us in our efforts toward the resources management necessary
    to make this planet fit to house future generations of man.â€
        James J. Harford, Executive Secretary of American Institute of
    Aeronautics and Astronautics, said in article that guessing shuttleâ€™s
    significance was â€œlike trying to predict what the DC-3 would lead to
    in air transportation six years before its first flight. The space shuttle
    could be that powerful and more.â€ If shuttle performed the way NASA
    intended it to-â€œand NASAâ€™s      Apollo track record has to impress even
    the cynicalâ€-shuttle would â€œhelp to create entire new industries and
    . . . hundreds of thousands of new jobs.â€ (W News, 3/28/72, 27, 29)

    James A. Loudon to Jan. 16 letter in which former scientist-astronaut
     Dr. Brian T. Oâ€™Leary questioned compatibility of space shuttle with
    national goals. Oâ€™Leary letter had been â€œstrange document from a
    man who wrote a whole book to complain that scientists donâ€™t have
     access to space.â€ Shuttleâ€™s most important aspect, â€œaside from its
    economy,â€ was its ability to carry passengers. â€œFor the first time,
    scientists will be able to perform experiments in space without spending
    years in irrelevant pilot training first.â€ Shuttleâ€™s effect would be â€œto
    make space very much more available, with results for a dozen

  Progress in NASA development of technology to alleviate aircraft noise
    pollution and ensure quieter aircraft operation was described by
    Walter A. Pennino, Public Affairs Officer in Office of Aeronautics and
    Space Technology (OAST) , at NASA Hq. press briefing. Research had
    shown aircraft noise could be reduced if pilot flew aircraft â€œso that
    it climbs quicklyâ€ to be â€œas far from a ground observer as possible.â€
    When wing flaps were retracted as aircraft accelerated, aircraft re-
    quired â€œless thrust to climb. When a safe altitude is reached, the pilot
    can reduce the engine thrust from that required for takeoff to the lower
    thrust required for climb.â€ NASA and Federal Aviation Administration
    were encouraging airlines to adopt two-segment approach to reduce
    landing noise. Pilot would adjust controls to descent first at 6â€ glide
    slope. About one mile from the runway he would change path to slope.
    In final stages there would be no difference in the landing procedure.
    Aircraft would approach with engine power somewhat reduced and
    would be at higher altitude. Noise reduction would be three to five
    effective perceived noise in decibels (epndb) one nautical mile from
    the end of the runway and even greater reduction farther out from
    the runway. Ames and Langley Research Centers were studying re-
    quirements to make two-segment approach safe standard procedure.
    In Lewis Research Center Quiet Engine Program, experimental engines
    suitable for conventional takeoff and landing aircraft were being built.
    Test had shown reduction of noise by using quiet engine with and
    without acoustically treated nacelle. Goal chosen for short takeoff
    and landing (STOL) aircraft was 95 epndb at 152 m (500 ft). â€œWe
    donâ€™t have an engine that can do that job right now, but NASA is
    working on it.â€
       Follow-on programs for new family of aircraft were described by
    James 0. Kramer, Chief of Noise and Pollution Reduction Branch
    in OAST Aeronautical Propulsion Div. â€œPreliminary design study con-

  Analysis of â€œexceptionalâ€ satellite picture of Alaskan topography ob-
    tained by image dissector camera system (IDS) aboard Nimbus 4
     (launched April 8, 1970) was described by US. Geological Survey
    scientist Ernest H. Lathram in Science. Major structural features
    had been identified despite relatively low degree of ground resolution
    of image, which had been exposed at altitude of 1 0 km (680 mi).

    Regional lines not yet recognized in surface mapping had been per-
    ceived. Synoptic view provided by image showed orthogonal fractures
    not heretofore apparent in regional maps of Alaska that might reflect
    â€œconjugate set of fractures within the crust which has exerted significant
    control over the geological history of the state.â€ Scientists had con-
    cluded increased resolution in other images from space platforms, like
    resolution of 60 to 200 m (200 to 650 ft) planned for Earth Resources

* Expansion of environmental and resource base beyond earth was urged
    by North American Rockwell Corp. scientist Dr. Krafft A. mricke in
    New York Times article. Great crisis of the time was fact â€œmanâ€™s nature
    is attuned to an-infinite, indestructible worldâ€ but earth had ceased
    to be indestructible. Global development, therefore, â€œmust be based
    on an open-world concept and include both the development of extra-
    terrestrial resources and the wiser management of our terrestrial
    resources.â€ Extraterrestrial imperative was â€œindivisibility of Earth
    and space.â€ (NYT, 3/31/72)
* Sophisticated TV systems were being used by some of worldâ€™s largest
    telescopes to record planetary atmospheres, faint galaxies, and quasi-
    stellar objects, Science reported. Astronomers had been criticized for
    being less receptive to new technologies than other physical scientists.

During March: NASA released Funds for Research, Development, R&D
    Plant and Scientific Technical Information, Fiscal Years 1971-1973:
    Annual Report to the National Science Foundation. Report, for inclu-
    sion in government-wide survey published by NSF for Congress, White
    House, Government agencies, and scientific community, showed dis-
    tribution of NASA funds based on FY 1973 budget estimates. It reflected
             total direct obligations incurred in FY 1971 and budget esti-
    NASAâ€™s
    mates for FY 1972 and FY 1973. In FY 1973 NASA would fund approxi-
    mately 19% of Federal Governmentâ€™s total research and development
    effort and provide 23% of funds for research, alone. When Dept. of
    Defense was excluded from computation, NASA was expected to conduct
    36% of total civilian R&D effort. Total research in FY 1973 was
    expected to show 4% increase over FY 1971.
        For first time since FY 1962 research would represent over 50%
    of NASA funding for Research and Development. Increase in research
    resulted in decreased funding for development, with impending com-
    pletion of Apollo and Skylab development; decrease was offset to a
    degree by funds applied to begin space shuttle development. Analysis
    of funding showed decline in engineering funds of about 7% of total,
    with increases in physical and life sciences. Reduction in engineering
    reflected anticipated completion of Apollo. High Energy Astronomy
    Observatory (HEAO) program effected increase in astronomy, and
    Viking program, increase in chemistry and biology. (Text)
  Scope of United Kingdom participation in space was described by A. V.
    Cleaver in Spaceflight article. British annual space budget was $70

    from a modest interest in all aspects of the subject to an almost com-
    plete concentration on satellites or spacecraft, to the exclusion of launch
    vehicles.â€ Policy was based on assumptions that satellite was most
    technically interesting and commercially profitable aspect of space
    activities; that U.K. was â€œnot too far behind to catch up in this field,
    whereas we are on launchersâ€; and that there was no need to duplicate
    U.S. rocket achievements because US. would sell Europe necessary
    launch vehicles. (SF, 3/72, 99-102)
  First successful transmission of fingerprint records via satellite, using
    Ats 1 (launched Dec. 6, 1966) was reported by Government Pho-
    tography. Fingerprints and photos filed by Videofilm system equipment
    in Sacramento, Calif., were transmitted as video signals to Videofile
    system in Tallahassee, Fla.; converted to video recordings; and re-
    trieved by â€œinstant replayâ€ as TV pictures and printed copies in

     largely existing water-processing concepts, the development has gone
     toward making the concepts efficient on a small scale and adapting
     them, where necessary, to zero gravity.â€ NASA systems were â€œfar cry
     from the integrated, simplified systems needed for domestic water
     reclamation of the futureâ€ but provided â€œbase from which to work.â€

    published in New York Times. Interview, described as â€œfirst full
    public discussion of the negotiations from the Soviet point of view,â€
    had been obtained in Moscow by Times science writer John N. Wilford.
     Petrov had emphasized that â€œtangible progressâ€ had been achieved
     and he was â€œoptimisticâ€ about prospects of joint space flight, tech-
     nically feasible in â€œthe middle of the nineteen-seventies.â€ Government
     approval would â€œdepend muchâ€ on April meetings in Moscow between
     NASA and Soviet Academy officials and May meeting in Moscow of
    Working Groups on rendezvous and docking. Petrov said compatible
     docking system would allow â€œdocking of spaceships of our countries
     with the humane aim of rendering help to crews of spaceships and
     space stations in distress. These systems would also allow joint
     experiments during the flights in space.â€ Petrov said negotiations
     had occurred in â€œatmosphere of mutual understanding and business-
     like discussionâ€ that â€œgives us the hope that all the difficulties connected

  Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, told press in Washington, D.C.,
     he believed US. and U.S.S.R. would sign agreement during 1972 for
    joint mission in which Apollo spacecraft would dock with Soviet
     Salyut orbiting laboratory in 1975. At dinner party for seven newsmen
     Dr. Fletcher said: â€œWe certainly donâ€™t believe that the first mission of
     American and Soviet astronauts together will be the last.â€ Mission
                                                                  ...   I also
     would â€œtake a lot of planning and some hardware changes.
     think the crews will need time to train together for the first flight.â€
     Crews would be bilingual and familiar with each otherâ€™s spacecraft.
     Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, John L. Swigert, Jr., and Donald K.
     Slayton were already studying Russian. First joint docking mission
     would cost US. as much as $300 million, most of it to keep manned
     flight facilities intact after conclusion of 1973 Skylab mission. Dr.
     Fletcher foresaw series of joint US. and U.S.S.R. missions, each
     longer and more ambitious. U.S.S.R. was emphasizing space station
     while US. emphasized shuttle. â€œI think it only logical that the two
     hook up together, especially since the shuttle will have rescue capa-
     bility.â€ U.S.S.R. was expected to continue Lunokhod lunar rover and
     lunar sample return programs and â€œprobably marry the two some time
     in the next two years. I also think they will attempt a manned lunar
     landing, but not until late in the ,709, perhaps 1977.â€ (Oâ€™Toole,

     years. Object was to assess â€œwhether manâ€™s participation is possible
     and feasible and to identify major obstacles and unknowns that must
     be resolved.â€ Common problems were life support in space environment,
     confinement of crew in spacecraft and isolation from outside world
     except for communication with ground, maintenance of health without
     access to elaborate medical facilities, provision of crew training facili-
     ties, and crew selection with regard to ability to tolerate long-term
     isolation psychologically. Unknown factors included possible hazardous
     effects of prolonged weightlessness and of high-energy cosmic ray
     particles (high Zs) in deep space. Major recommendations were:
     research to determine course of physical deconditioning over two
     years of weightless and restricted activity; study of effects of radiation
     from highZ particles; research program on effects of confinement to
     emphasize cognitive functioning; measurement and test of crewâ€™s
     physiological, psychological, and performance status in flight ; incor-
     poration of life-support and safety requirements, including medical
     and dental facilities, into spacecraft engineering and emphasis on
     habitability of spacecraft ; adoption of systems analysis approach to
     mission to provide common frame of reference for interdisciplinary

      datory for certain military missions-and low recurring costs for
      multiple missions are important advantages of small reactor systems.
      For unmanned NASA earth orbit missions, reactors become cost effective
      above a few kilowatts, a power range needed for such applications
      missions as communications satellites. In manned missions . . . over-
      riding advantage of reactor systems is their ability to accommodate

April 9: Americans were wondering why US. spent â€œ$44 billionâ€ to land
     on moon rather than on programs for social action, Jeffrey St. John
     commented in Los Angeles Times article. â€œThe fact remains, however,
     that long before the landing of Apollo 11 public funds for social
     problems on earth had risen far beyond the annual space budgets. In
     1972, the federal government has earmarked $100 billion for social
     action programs, as opposed to $3.2 billion for space. The ratio of
     expenditures for space and social action programs during the 15 years
     of the space effort has been roughly 1 to 1 in favor of social action.â€

     Lunar landing had been â€œtriumph of 400,000 scientists, engineers, and

     panies, large and small.â€ Apollo had been LLclear-cut    example of a
     successful government ventureâ€ but on earth Government had â€œmade
     a mess of the social landscape.â€ Compounding irrationality was refusal
     of liberals to understand why â€œspace program succeeded, largely as a
     private endeavor coordinated by government, and why social problems
     grow worse under governmentâ€™s guidance.â€
        To accomplish lunar mission, space program participants had needed
     two crucial elements: â€œintellectual freedomâ€ to analyze a problem
     correctly and %trict observance of natural laws.â€ In social problem-
     solving, intellectual freedom was abandoned for political expediency
     that played one pressure group against another and â€œthere is a con-
     tinual violation of certain immutable natural laws. Namely, the refusal
     of the social planners to believe the slums and poverty can be the
     products of an absence of individual initiative and enterprise.â€ ( L A

* Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, discussed relevancy of space
     program to communications field and scored antitechnologists as â€œmis-
     guided,â€ in speech before National Assn. of Broadcasters engineersâ€™
     luncheon in Chicago: â€œOur success in gathering information from space
     is forcing a revamping of surface communications as they relate to
     data transmission, and a substantial upgrading of the capacity of the
     systemâ€™s components. The echoes of our revolutions will be heard in
     many sectors. . . . They will be as beneficial as they will be far-
     reaching.â€
        Disputing anti-technologists, Dr. Fletcher said that â€œthey argue that,
     if the space program is done away with, the problems that are rooted
                                                        ...   and . . . funds
     in technological advance will disappear as well
     now allocated to space can be applied to poverty, aid to the inner city
     and to other national needs.â€ This was nonsense. â€œIn so arguing, the
     base for planned error has been laid. A fundamentally irrational posi-
     tion has been taken. Critics of this stripe are unable or unwilling
     to recognize that technology is a tool-and nothing more.â€ As space
     program progressed, Dr. Fletcher said, â€œI am confident that . . . we
     will be able to confront the anti-technologist with a sequence of results
                             .
     from our space work . . that have a direct impact on the solving of
     some of the social problems that concern him-and          the rest of us.

     process, it is important that we take every precaution that his campaign
     does not impede the formation of the wise policies of federal support.

     plained configuration and costs. Dr. Fletcher said that in halving cost
     of original plans main sacrifice was that â€œwe are not reusing all the
     parts. We use this expendable gas tank to supply the orbiter. . . .
     That, however, had an enormous effect on the size. We were able
     to bring the size of the orbiter down so that we were able to use solid
     fuel rockets.â€ Dr. Low added, â€œWe sacrificed nothing in terms of
     what kinds of satellites, what kinds of payloads we can put into orbit.â€
        Estimates of larger costs by shuttle opponents had been derived by

     the communications satellites, and all of those things that would be
      carried anyway, whether there is a Shuttle or not,â€ Dr. Low said.

      experiments in space, we can do that.â€
           Queried on comparison of US. and U.S.S.R. space programs, Dr.
      Fletcher said, â€œIt is quite apparent that over the last 3 or 4 years, the
      Soviet space effort has grown in dollar volume and in number of
      launches per year, during the period that ours has declined. So that
      . . . they are spending quite a bit more in space than we are. It is
      estimated that perhaps 2 percent of their gross national product is spent
                                                                          ..
      for space, whereas a half of a percent of our GNP is spent on space. .
      Our number of launches per year has steadily declined from a peak of
                                                      ...
      something [like] almost 80 in 1966, down to            the order of 30 or
      35 in 1970 and 1971; whereas, the number of their launches has
                         .

    Physicist Dr. Ralph E. Lapp testified on space shuttle economics before
      Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences during FY 1973
      NASA authorization hearings. Following testimony by Dr. Oskar Morgen-
      stern, Chairman of Board of Mathematica, Inc., and Dr. Klaus P.
      Heiss of Mathematica, on corporationâ€™s study of space shuttle economics
       [see Jan. 311, Dr. Lapp criticized calculations and said entire issue
      of launch vehicle choices for future should be restudied. He said
      shuttle payloads would average â€œ10 times more expensive than their
                                Cost would be $5100 per 0.5 kg (1 lb) for
      weight in solid
      launches 1979-1990. Cost projection prepared for NASA had indicated
      $7-billion saving for shuttle launches in program that would cost $42
      billion using current methods, Dr. Lapp said. He added that no such
      $42-billion program had been authorized for the 1980s. U.S. tax-
      payers could save $19 billion by not building space shuttle and by
      using existing rockets for space program. (Transcript)

  Selection of Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Vandenberg Air
     Force Base in California as launch and landing sites for space shuttle
     was announced by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, in
     Washington, D.C. KSC site would be used for research and development
     launches, to begin in 1978, and for all operational flights into easterly
     orbits. NASA would provide facilities for shuttle users at KSC by modi-
     fication of existing facilities. Vandenberg AFB site would be phased in
     toward end of decade for shuttle flights requiring high-inclination
     orbits. Dept. of Defense would provide basic shuttle facilities. NASA
     Site Review Board studies had shown Kennedy-Vandenberg com-
     bination had cost, operational, and safety advantages over all other
     US. sites. Cost of establishing facilities at KSC was estimated at $150
     million; at Vandenberg, $500 million.
         Decision to use KSC was â€œmost gratifying to NASAâ€™s    launch organi-
     zationâ€ and ensured â€œcontinued utilization of this base and the sup-
     porting Eastern Test Range,â€ Dr. Kurt H. Debus, KSC Director, said
     in statement read at â€˜KSC press briefing following announcement of
     shuttle site selection.
         Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, explained at KSC
     briefing why site construction at Vandenberg AFB would cost more
     than at KSC: â€œAt Kennedv we can make full use of the Saturn V launch
      complex-Complex 39. The Shuttle will be brought back in there after
               .                        .                         .

    suited to the shuttle.â€ Larger modifications would be required, â€œand this
    is where the cost is.â€
        Selection between KSC and Vandenberg for a particular launch
    would depend on required launch azimuth, Dr. Low said. â€œIf we
                                             .
    launched something toward the east . . then it makes sense to launch
    it from the east coast, whether it is for the Department of Defense
    or for NASA or for civilian users. When you launch into a polar orbit,
    or a high-inclination orbit, then it makes more sense to launch from
    the west coast so you donâ€™t overfly land.â€
        In response to question, Dr. Low said NASA did not plan to mate
    Air Force-supplied booster with shuttle. â€œNASA will develop, or have
    developed under NASA contract by industry, the full shuttle including
    the orbiter, its large tanks, and the solid rocket motor.â€ NASA did
    have â€œclear understandingâ€ with DOD that it would use shuttle when it

  Final Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences hearing on
     NASA FY 1973 authorization bill heard teshmony on space shittle
    by Dr. Brian Oâ€™Brien, physicist and Chairman of NASA Space Pro-
     gram Advisory Council and of National Academy of Sciencesâ€™ Ad-
     visory Committee to Air Force Systems Command. Committee also
     heard shuttle testimony from Dr. Courtland D. Perkins, Chairman of
     Princeton Univ. of Dept. of Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences and
     Chairman of NASA Space Systems Committee.
        Dr. Oâ€™Brien said he believed shuttle would provide â€œspace trans-
     portation system which can be available on short notice to meet unfore-
     seen conditions which may result from world events, and . . . great
     flexibility in our space operations, whether civil or military.â€ It â€œshould
     make possible a drastic reduction in cost of launches and in cost
     of payloads destined for earth orbit; while providing the opportunity
     for refurbishing or repairing satellites in orbit, or returning them to
     earth. In short, it should prove an invaluable tool in keeping us at the
     forefront in our operations in space.â€
         Dr. Perkins said nothing NASA could do â€˜â€˜could have a more profound
     effect on the total space program in the years ahead.â€ Shuttle would
     provide launch capability for nearly all programs, manned and un-
     manned, permitting elimination of large stable of rocket boosters and
     large complex of launch sites. Program provided strong signal to young
     scientists and engineers that US. wasnâ€™t â€œabout to throw away our
     carefully developed competence in spaceâ€ and it was one of only few
     new national programs continuing â€œgrowth and stretchâ€ in high tech-
      nology. (Transcript)
  John N. Wilford contrasted US. and U.S.S.R. space programs in New
      York Times article: â€œAs American astronauts prepare for another
      Apollo voyage to the moon . . . their counterparts in the Soviet Union
      are training for long-duration flights in earth-orbiting laboratories,
      leaving their own lunar exploration to automatic probes. As the Amer-
      ican Pioneer 10 heads for Jupiter, a Soviet spacecraft, Venus 8 is
      traveling toward a planned softlanding on Venus. As American engi-
      neers design a reusable shuttle for ferrying men and satellites into
      space, the Russians apparently are still trying to develop a giant rocket
      to give them lifting power as great or greater than the Saturn V. As

    American launchings run about 30 a year and the space budget is under
    public attack, the Russians are launching nearly three times as many
    spacecraft and, if anything, are expanding their space program.â€ Con-
   trasts had been highlighted in interviews with space officials during
    Wilfordâ€™s month-long visit to U.S.S.R. during March. According to Dr.
    Boris N. Petrov, director of Soviet Academy of Sciences Intercosmos
    Branch, â€œthe priorities of the Soviet space program will remain the
    systematic research of near-earth space with the help of automatic
    stations, manned spaceships and orbital stations. For the moon and
    the nearest planets, the priority will continue to be research with the
    help of automated means.â€ (NYT, 4/14/72, 10)

* Use of energy in cosmic plasma to launch spacecraft inexpensively was
    discussed in Science by Dr. Hannes 0. Alfven, Univ. of California at
    San Diego physicist. Energy for space propulsion was being used in
    <L
      extremely inefficientâ€ way because of low exhaust velocity of rocket
    gases. Total start weight of spacecraft â€œmust be two or three orders of
    magnitude larger than the payload.â€ By plasma ejection, â€œone can
    easily reach exhaust velocities of several tens of kilometers per secondâ€
    so that â€œthe ejected mass may be of the same order of magnitude as
    the payload and the efficiency very high.â€ Energy for launch could be
    supplied from solar wind, tapping voltage of 1000 v if transfer resist-
    ance between ends of conductors and solar wind could be â€œmade
    small.â€ Or energy could be supplied by transfer from ground through
    plasma channel in atmosphere. â€œWhen Apollo 12 was launched, there
    were low clouds but no thunderstorm. When the spacecraft had dis-
    appeared in the clouds, lightning was observed . . . where the space-
    craft had last been seen. This effect was interpreted as due to the
    exhaust gases which facilitated a discharge of electrostatic charges
    in the clouds down to the ground. One cannot avoid thinking that it
    would be preferable to transfer power up to the Spacecraft in this way.â€
    If spacecraft at launch was â€œaccelerated by two plasma guns at a large
    distance from each other, and electric arcs are produced between
    each . . . and the corresponding electrodes on the ground, it is possible
    that these arcs can be maintained during the launch through the at-
    mosphere.â€ (Science, 4/14/72, 167-8)

    Apollo Spacecraft Program Manager James A. McDivitt said Apollo 16
     countdown was â€œprobably the smoothestâ€ to date. McDivitt announced
    that Apollo 16 would be last flight with which he would be associated:
     â€œI really donâ€™t have any plans for the future because Iâ€™ve really been
     concentrating on Apollo 16, and while I made the decision that it
     would probably be a good time for me to leave the program, I have

    not had time to really sit down . [and] think through what my future
     would be.â€ Primary reason for leaving program after Apollo 16,
     rather than after Apollo 17, was so that if change meant move to new
     location McDivittâ€™s children could enter new schools at beginning of
     new school year. McDivitt was Air Force brigadier general and had
     been commander of Apollo 9 mission (March 3-13, 1969) and com-
    mand pilot of Gemini 4 (June 3-7, 1965) during seven years as NASA

          Unexplained light-colored particles streaming from LM close-out
     panel during docking were reported by crew at 7:18 GET. Young and
     Duke entered LM, powered up, and found all systems normal. Grass-
     like particles, shown on CM TV, were later identified as shredded
     thermal paint, but degraded thermal protection was not expected to
     affect LM operations. First midcourse correction (MCC-1) was can-
     celed because spacecraft trajectory was near nominal.
          Electrophoresis demonstration began on schedule at 25 :05 GET and
     appeared to be successful, from crewâ€™s description of reaction of
     charged particles in liquid. Ultraviolet (W) photographs of earth
     from 107 300 km (66 700 mi) and 216 600 km (134 600 mi) were
     taken as planned. Duke reported â€œspectacularâ€ view of half earth from
     201 000-km (125 000-mi) altitude when he could see sun shining on
     only half of planet. During MCC-2, made at 30:39 GET, services pro-
     pulsion system (SPS) tank pressure anomaly that had occurred earlier
     in mission was tracked and minor leak in transducer reference cavity
     was located. Procedures were sent to crew to account for transducer
      reading. Visual light flash experiment was started about two hours
     late, at 49:lO GET, because of problem in aligning spacecraft. Duke
      counted 70 white, instantaneous light flashes that left no after-glow.
      uv photography of earth at 327 800 km (203 700 mi) was completed
      as planned.
          Young and Duke entered LM at 53:50 GET for two-hour checkout

      module (SIM) door jettisoned at 69:59 GET.
          April 19-24: Apollo 16 entered lunar orbit with 314-km (195.9-
      mi) apolune and 107.7-km (66.9-mi) perilune after lunar orbit inser-
      tion (LOI) burn at 74:28 GET (3:22 pm EST April 19). Young, who
      had orbited moon in Apollo 10 (May 18-26, 1969), said moon was
      <<
         just as fantastic as it ever was.â€ He described black mounds like vol-
      canic craters with white central peaks and said central peak of Tsiol-
      kovsky Crater looked like â€œa white marshmallow in a sea of hot
      chocolate.â€ Astronauts also described whitish fracture patterns that
      looked like chalk scribbling and surface markings like chicken tracks.
      Mattinglv said Humboldt Crater had â€œevery contrast in color on the
      moon.â€ Material overflowing from Descartes crater looked like cinder
      fields and submerged craters looked like coral atolls of South Pacific.
      Young and Duke reentered LM, powered up LM systems, and noted
      pressure rise in reaction control system (RCS) helium pressure regu-
      lator. About 25 kg (54 lbs) of fuel and oxidizer were transferred to
      LM APS tank in attempt to prevent rupture of burst disc, but disc
      ruptured at 95 :03 GET, decreasing helium source pressure.
           CSM-LM undocking and separation maneuver was conducted on
      schedule at 96:14 GET. When Young and Duke came from behind
      moon in LM, Duke told Mission Control his helmet was full of oranqe
      juice. Dukeâ€™s microDhone apparently had become entangled with tube
      through which he drank juice stored in his spacesuit. â€œEvery time I
      turn my head I get orange juice. Itâ€™s delicious . . . but itâ€™s better in
      your mouth than floating around the cockpit. Iâ€™ve already had an
      orange shampoo.â€

        When Mattingly came from behind moon in CSM he reported he
     had not conducted circularization burn because of malfunction in SPS
     yaw gimbal servo loop. While flight controllers evaluated problem,
     LM-powered descent-initiate maneuver was delayed, and LM and cSM
     maneuvered into station-keeping mode prepared to dock or continue
     landing procedures. Analysis of problem identified malfunction in
     secondary circujt that would not preclude lunar landing. Second sepa-
     ration maneuver by CSM with RCS burn was performed and LM began
     descent to moon on 16th revolution.
         LM Orion touched down in moonâ€™s Descartes region 230 m (755 ft)
     northwest of planned target point at 104:30 GET (9:23 pm EST April
     20). â€œWow, down. Old Orion is finally here, Houston. Fantastic,â€
     Duke exclaimed. â€œAll weâ€™ve got to do is jump out the hatch and weâ€™ve
     got plenty of rocks.â€ Duke and Young said site was rolling country
     surrounded by mountains and covered with big boulders. Sunlight was
     so bright it washed out moonâ€™s colors and made lunar surface appear
     white. Since LM had stayed in lunar orbit six hours longer than planned
     it was powered down to conserve electrical power and first extravehic-
     ular activity (EVA-1) was rescheduled to follow sleep period.
         EVA-1 began at 119:05 GET (11:59 am EST April 21). Young
     climbed down ladder and stepped onto lunar surface. â€œOkay, Cayley
     Plains,â€ he said, â€œApollo 16 is gonna change your image.â€ Duke
     followed and astronauts began deploying experiments. Because of
     problems with LM antenna astronautsâ€™ first steps on moon-for first
     time-were not beamed back to earth. Once Young and Duke set up
     portable antenna, TV signal and communication with ground control-
     lers were received clearly on earth. TV pictures showed bleak, pale
     surface resembling Apollo 15 site, with flat-topped Smoky Momtain
     to north and Stone Mountain to south. Astronauts said site was rockier,
      more hilly, and more cratered than previous landing sites. Soil was
      firm, with rocks scattered over 30% of the surface and small craters
      covering 70%. During deployment of Apollo lunar surface experiments
      package (ALSEP) Young tripped over heat flow experiment (HFE)
      cable, pulling it from connector after Duke had drilled first bore hole.
      Mission Control later developed way to repair $1.2-million experiment,
      but procedure was not used because it would have been too complex
      and too time consuming and included some risk to other ALSEP com-
      ponents. US. flag and remaining ALSEP components were deployed
      successfully and functioned nominally.
         Crew deployed LRV and found ampere readings for battery No. 2
      off-scale low and rear steering inoperable. About 40 min later, after
      loading, all meters and rear steering operated properly and LRV
      performed nominally throughout remainder of EVA.
         Young and Duke explored Flag, Spook, Plum, and Buster Craters
      and collected 20 kg (44 lbs) of samples, including number of white
      rocks. One crystalline rock coated with bluish glass appeared to have
      same texture as anorthosite â€œGenesis rockâ€™â€™ collected on Apollo 15
      mission; another was pure white. Some were flecked with green and

                                                          a
      black glass, some were black and gray, and one wei hed about 6% kg
       (14 lbs). EVA-1 terminated at 126:16 GET after 7 rs 1 min 1 sec.

April 16-27: Stars near the center of the Milky W a y galaxy were photographed
from the surface of the moon during Apollo 16. An ultraviolet cameralspectrograph,
designed and built by the Naval Research Laboratory, made photos in far ultraviolet
light with hydrogen light filtered out, recording only the very hot, blue stars
(streaked in the photo because of the moonâ€™s rotation during the 30-minute exposure).

     Survey Ridge and Stone Mountain and said ridge was pockmarked
     with small, subdued craters, most about one meter (three feet) wide
     and some containing smaller craters within main crater. Area around
     South Ray Crater was strewn with sharp boulders and resembled crater
     in Nevada where astronauts had trained. Young and Duke turned on
     LRV TV so viewers could watch them walking and collecting samples
     high up on slope of Stone Mountain. They reported seeing more of
     previously discovered white soil under gray surface layers and said
     soil was very loosely consolidated.
        While ascending ridge and traversing very rocky terrain, LRV rear
     wheels failed to respond at full throttle. LRV continued to move, but
     front wheels were digging in. Troubleshooting procedures identified
     mismatch of power mode switching. After change in switch configura-
     tion LRV worked properly. Astronauts took core samples and collected
     rocks that appeared to be volcanic, a greenish rock shaped like a
     snakeâ€™s head, and pure crystalline rocks. EVA was televised in color

     with       camera and was extended 20 min. During crewâ€™s return to
              LRV
     LM, 5-cm (%in) portion of Youngâ€™s portable life support system
      (PLSS) antenna broke off, causing 15- to 18-db drop in signal strength.
     EVA-2 ended at 150:14 GET after 7 hrs 23 min 26 sec.
        Third EVA began 30 min early at 165:45 GET (10:27 am EST April
     23) to allow additional time near North Ray Crater and two other
     stations. Astronauts chipped off samples from enormous basalt rock the
     size of a house. All planned activities were accomplished, but astro-
     nauts had trouble configuring cosmic ray detector for stowage and
     return to earth. LRV covered 9% km (6 mi) and reached 17 km per
     hr (11 mph) going down 15â€™ slope. TV coverage was excellent
     throughout EVA. Total EVA-3 time was 5 hrs 40 min 14 sec-bringing
     total EVA time to 20 hrs 14 min 54 sec and total distance traversed to
     27.1 km (16.8 mi).
        While LM was on moon, Mattingly, orbiting moon in Casper, com-
     pleted lunar and astronomic photography and prepared for rendezvous.
     He radioed information to geologists at Mission Control to help them
     plan EVA-3 exploration of Stone Mountain and determine best way
     to approach North Ray Crater. He located radioactive hot spot on
     eastern edge of Ocean of Storms south of Apollo 14 landing site and
     gamma spectrometer identified thorium, potassium, and uranium.
     Mattingly also discovered, on far side of moon, volcanic lava flows
     that resembled maria flows and spilled out over northeast rim of crater
     high in mountains near lunar equator. Two areas resembled volcanic
     flows around Flagstaff, Ariz., where crew had trained. Many large
     basins on moonâ€™s far side appeared to be covered with same kind of
     material that covered area around Apollo 16 site.
         Young and Duke depressurized LM, discarded excess equipment,
     repressurized LM, and lifted off lunar surface with 96.6 kg (213 lbs)
     of lunar samples at 175:44 GET (8:26 pm EST April 24). Liftoff was
     photographed in color by camera on LRV left on moon and was seen
     by millions of TV viewers. Spacecraft docked successfully and LM
     crew transferred samples, film, and equipment to CSM. For first time
      docking was not seen on TV, because LM steerable antenna was inop-
     erable. LM jettison was delayed one day so that astronauts could rest.
      After LM jettison at 195:12 GET, LM lost altitude and began tumbling,
      apparently because circuit breaker in attitude-and-translation-controller
      assemblyâ€™s primary guidance and navigation system had accidentally
     been left open. LM ascent stage remained in lunar orbit and was
      expected to impact lunar surface in about one year. Boom that carried
      instrument to measure atmosphere of moon was jettisoned because it
      would not retract and might have broken off. Orbit-shaping maneuvers
      were canceled to avoid firing of SPS because of degraded backup SPS
      thrust vector control.
         Scientific Subsatellite was launched at 196:14 GET (4:56 EST April
      24) into lunar orbit with 123.3-km (76.6-mi) apolune and 97.9-km
       (60.8-mi) perilune. Hexagonal, 40-kg (90-lb) satellite 77 cm long and
      36 cm in diameter (30 x 14 in) carried three experiments. Subsatellite
      extended three 1Yz-m (5-ft ) booms, two with magnetometer sensors
      to measure interplanetary and earth magnetic fields near moon and
      third for stabilization. Spacecraft also carried particle shadows and
      boundary layer experiment to collect data on plasmas and solar flares

   and S-band transponder to detect variations in lunar gravity caused
   by mascons. Expected lifetime was 6 to 9 mos-shorter       than 12 mos
   planned because shaping burn to optimize orbit had not been per-
   formed-but Subsatellite crashed into moon May 29.
      Transearth injection maneuver at 200:33 GET put CSM on trajectory
   for earth after 114 hrs 5 min (65 revolutions) in lunar orbit.
      April 25-27: Good-quality TV pictures of receding moon from
   inside CM and of lunar surface from LRV on moon were transmitted
   between 227 and 229 GET. At 243:35 GET (3:43 pm EST April 25)
   Mattingly left CSM for inflight EVA to retrieve panoramic and mapping
   camera fiIm cassettes from SIM on SM. Mattingly made two trips,
   during which he observed condition of instruments, reported that
   insulation paint near rocket nozzle was blistered, and deployed and
   exposed microbial ecological evaluation device (MEED) experiment
   for 10 min. He reentered CSM after 1 hr 24 min. Scheduled TV press
   conference began at 268:13 GET and ended at 268:32 GET. Astronauts
   briefly described moonâ€™s far side, including crater Guyot, which seemed
   to be so full of material that it overflowed and spilled down side of
   the crater.
      CM separated from SM at 290:08 GET, 15 min before entry interface
   at 121 900-m (400 000-ft) altitude. Drogue and main parachutes
   deployed normally and CM splashed down and flipped upside-down in
   mid-Pacific about 5 km (3 mi) from recovery ship U.S.S. Ticonderoga
   at 2:44 pm EST April 27, after 11-day 2-hr (265-hr 51-min) mission.
      After flipping spacecraft upright by inflating air bags, astronauts,
   wearing fresh flight suits, left CM and were carried by helicopter to
   biomed area on recovery ship for postflight examinations. After being
   declared in excellent condition, astronauts were flown on following
   day to Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and to Ellington AFB, Tex.
   Young had lost 3% kg (7% lbs) ; Mattingly, 3 kg (6% lbs); and
   Duke, 2% kg (59â€ lbs) , but all were â€œeuphoric, hungry and thirsty,
   and walking well.â€ CM was retrieved and placed in dolly on board
   recovery ship. Lunar samples, data, and equipment were flown to
   Ellington AFB and CM was off-loaded at San Diego.
      Mission achieved primary ApoZZo 16 objectives: to make selenologi-
   cal survey and sampling of materials in preselected area of Descartes
   region ; emplace and activate surface experiments; evaluate capability
   of Apollo equipment to provide extended lunar surface stay time,
   increased EVA operations, and surface mobility; and conduct inflight
   experiments and photographic tasks from lunar orbit. Launch vehicle
   and spacecraft systems performance were near nominal except for
   lack of rate feedback in thrust vector control and yaw oscillations that
   delayed lunar landing, caused revision of lunar surface activities, and
   necessitated end of mission one day earlier than planned. All anomalies
   were quickly analyzed and resolved or compensated for by work-
   around procedures developed to permit mission to continue. Flight
   crew performance was excellent. Minor errors made by crew were
   attributed to fatigue and did not preclude mission success. Mission
   was officially judged a success.
      Accomplishments included largest payload (34 518 kg; 76 100 lbs)
   placed in lunar orbit, first cosmic ray detector deployed on lunar
   surface, first use of far-uv camera on lunar surface, longest lunar

    surface stay time (71 hrs 14 rnin), longest lunar surface EVA (20 hrs
    15 min) , and largest amount of lunar samples brought to earth (96.6
    kg; 213 lbs). In addition, astronauts returned 3793.5 m (12446 f t )
    of exposed film used on lunar surface and in lunar orbit.
        ApoZZo 16 was 13th Apollo mission to date, loth manned Apollo
    mission, and 5th successful manned lunar landing mission. ApoZZo 15
    had been conducted July 26-Aug. 7, 1971. Apollo program was di-
    rected by NASA Office of Manned Space Flight. Manned Spacecraft
    Center was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, Marshall
    Space Flight Center for Saturn V launch vehicle, and Kennedy Space
    Center for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was

     more impressed on his midnight visit to the floodlit launch pad with
     astronaut David R. Scott, â€œItâ€™s really a beautiful show, this white
     tender body of a rocket, supported by the clumsy but sometimes tender

April 18: Science briefing on magnetic enigmas of moon was held at
    Manned Spacecraft Center. Finding that rock samples of different
     kinds collected at all four Apollo landing sites were imprinted with
    magnetic field from 3 billion to 4 billion yrs ago was reported by Dr.
     David W. Strangway, Chief of MSC Geophysics Div. Laboratory tests
    had shown 400 to 500 gammas of local magnetic field would have been
     needed to leave magnetism observed in lunar rocks-%o to l/loo as
     strong as magnetism on earthâ€™s surface. Earthâ€™s magnetism was be-
     lieved to be caused by earthâ€˜s rapid spin and molten core but moon
     spun only once a month and had been assumed to be solid throughout.
     Analysis had determined that lunar rocks cooled from molten state
     between 3.6 billion and 4 billion yrs ago and it was â€œalmost certainâ€
     that rocks had acquired their magnetism at that time.
        Dr. Paul J. Coleman of Univ. of California at Los Angeles reported
    that findings obtained with Subsatellite launched from Apollo 15 Aug.
    4, 1971, had shown marked variations in lunar magnetism on moonâ€™s
     far side, with sharp, even peak near crater Van de Graaf close to center
     of moonâ€™s far side.
        Dr. Palmer Dyal, Ames Research Center physicist, said ApoZZo 16
     efforts to find explanation for observed lunar magnetism would include
     survey of Palmetto Crater north of landing site to assess possibility
     that impacts of large meteorites could leave residue of local magnetism.
     Equipment included magnetometers left on moon by previous missions
     and lunar subsatellite to be ejected from ApoZZo 16 command module.

     science. Each Apollo rocket . . . has been the most complex and com-
     plicated machine ever made by man. Each has been composed of
     millions of parts, all or almost all of which have had to work per-

    Against that is the alternate risk of being overly cautious and aborting
    a mission unnecessarily, at huge financial and scientific loss.â€ It was

    military usefulness, D. J. R. Bruckner said in Wushington Post

    had conducted research with Dr. J. William Schopf and Dorothy
     Oehler of Univ. of California at Los Angeles on rocks Dr. Kvenvolden
    brought back in 1968 from Onverwacht Strata in Barberton Mountain
    Land near South Africaâ€™s border with Swaziland. Rocks showed fossil
    evidence of beginnings of photosynthesis-life process of plants. An-
    cient carbon found in rocks which could predate photosynthesis was
    similar to organic carbon in meteorites believed to have come from
     asteroid belt. Immediately above was layer of identical pre-Cambrian

    progress: â€œIt will take many months and even years before the full
    harvest of Apollo 16â€™s scientific contribution is in. But even now there
    is much material for scientists to analyze. It is information made
    available by the superb television pictures received here on earth,
    by the verbal descriptions of the astronauts and by the data radioed
                                                                 ..
    back to this planet from the various automatic sensors .          on the
    lunar surface.â€ Preliminary conclusion was â€œthat in some important
    ways the moon is now even more mysterious, even harder to under-
    stand, than it was before Apollo 16 took off. The additional knowledge
    of lunar conditions available from last weekendâ€™s exploration indicates
    that the reality of the moonâ€™s origin and history is even more complex
    than previous theories had assumed.â€ (NYT, 4/%/72, 34)

April 30: Apollo 16 discoveries were described in New York Times
     article. Mission had been â€œlongest, most ambitious and, in many
     respects, most productiveâ€ in Apollo series. Discoveries included fact
     that Descartes region of lunar highlands contained almost no speci-
    mens of unaltered volcanic rock despite regionâ€™s age, â€œolder than the
     seas and the more prominent craters.â€ Region had been found to
     contain breccia rock that had been â€œfragmented, jumbled, and cemented
     together again.â€ High magnetism observed at sites visited by Apollo 16
     astronauts might provide clue to moonâ€™s early history, since analysis
     of lava rocks on earth had indicated earthâ€™s magnetic field flipped over
     at intervals of thousands or millions of years, with shiâ‚¬t requiring
     centuries. Reverse polarity discovered in rocks near Apollo 16 landing
     site might mean moon had done magnetic flip at some time in its
     early history. Among experiments whose outcome was still uncertain
     was attempt to photograph and analyze ultraviolet light from hydrogen
     clouds thought by some scientists to exist and to be â€œmissing massâ€™â€™
     that would explain gravity assumed to be keeping clusters of galaxies
     from flying apart. (Sullivan, NYT, 4:/30/72, 3)

During April: Soviet Space Program, 1971 was released by Senate Com-

     Document 92-51 [see Jan. 6 and 221. Report-prepared by Library
     of Congress under direction of Dr. Charles S. Sheldon 11, Chief of
     Science Policy Research Div.-said 1971 had been peak year in Soviet
     space activity, with 83 successful launches against 31 for US. Soviet
     successes had included â€œremarkable performance of the roving lunar
     vehicle, Lunokhod 1, the versatile manned space station Salyut in
     which a manned world duration record was set, the arrival in Mars
     orbit of two very heavy payloads, Mars 2 and 3, and the placing in
     lunar orbit of the heavy automated laboratory Luna 19.â€ On negative
     side had been inability to develop large G booster, death of Soyuz
     cosmonauts, crash of Luna 28 on moon, failure of first Mars probe, and
     failure of Mars 2 and 3 landers to carry out planned experiments.
     U.S.S.R. in 1971 had flown manned-precursor spacecraft â€œwith greater
     maneuverability thanâ€™ the present ones, quite possibly testing the ad-
     vanced propulsion needed for manned lunar flight.â€ Soviet spokesmen
     had reiterated commitment to manned space stations, applications satel-
     lites, and unmanned planetary exploration throughout solar system.
     Manned lunar and planetary flights â€œcontinued to get mention as a later
     goal.â€ U.S.S.R. was expected to launch another Salyut to be visited by
      Soyuz 12 and 13 for long stay. Thus far U.S.S.R. had given space

* Relation of US. space program to national interest was discussed in
    Foreign Afairs article by Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director of NASAâ€™s
    Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA
    Associate Administrator: â€œTo some, space is, or should be, pure
    science; to others, it is prestige and the American image; to still
    others, space means national security.â€ Some space program students
    had said â€œits impact will be felt in other respects than the cost-
    accounting of economic productivity versus technological investment.
    There has been much discussion of the influence of space exploration
    on the mind and spirit of man, as an extension of the revolution in
    thought that was initiated by Copernicus and continued by Newton and
    Darwin. A study of the history and pre-history of man suggests that
    the human drive is expressed through just such tentative movements
    out of the world of tried experience into a new world of untested
    promise.
       â€œSputnik and the moon landing signaled the opening of a new
    frontier across which man can now travel into the endless reaches of
    outer space. The new frontier of space will not be closed quickly,
    for astronomical knowledge shows that billions of stars, some un-
    doubtedly accompanied by earthlike planets, surround us in the galaxy.
    Space exploration has brought home to more people than ever before
    the reality of this vast complex of stars and planets. â€˜Out thereâ€™ is
    really there, a place that one can get to. Never again can we make
    the mistake of identifying our speck of planetary matter as the uni-
    verse.â€ (Foreign Aflairs, 4/72, 532-44)

    Mars 3 capsule on Mars-â€œrelatively unproductive from the scientific

    the Soviet space program is now making great strides after many years

    tion and application. The characteristic pattern was a Soviet achieve-
    ment announced to a surprised world, followed some months later
    by a more sophisticated and more useful US. version of the same

       U.S.S.R. program was characterized by excessive secrecy because,
    according to Soviet officials, rockets used in space program were
    similar to those used in military program. Smith said genuine reason
    for secrecy â€œis the desire to guard against a failure in the full blaze
    of world publicity.â€ U.S.S.R. â€œguards against ever having to admit
    failure by announcing launches only post facto. If there is a launch
    pad failure there is no announcement at all. If orbit is reached by
    the spacecraft, but it does not function as planned, no mention is
    made of this in the curt bulletin.â€ If lunar or planetary probe failed
    to enter planned trajectory, mission objective â€œis not mentioned, and

         Soviet program had â€œlittle . . . of the technical virtuosity of the
      American approach,â€ but had more impetus and would â€œobviously
      continue on a growing scale. Apart from the progress in individual proj-
      ects, the ever increasing number of Soviet launches demonstrates that
      the Russian equivalent of NASA is financially more secure. And the speed
      with which the Soviet space establishment can respond to a failure is
      also a pointer to the massive scale of the back-up precautions which
      are taken.â€ Soviet progrcm, by its nature, was ensured greater financial

May 2: ApoUo 16 rock and photography briefing was held at Manned
    Spacecraft Center. Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of MSC Planetary and

    of Apollo 16 samples would be occupied with opening bags and
    weighing, dusting, photographing, and examining socks. Catalog,
    including photos, of all samples should be completed by end of May.
    Rocks examined to date appeared to be breccias. One rock-collected
    during third extravehicular activity and described on moon by As-
    tronaut Charles M. Duke, Jr., as â€œan honest to goodness igneous
    rockâ€-was different in texture and appearance from other typical
    breccias, but had not yet been precisely classified. â€œZap pitsâ€ on the
    surface indicated rock had been lying on one side. It was flattish with
    very fine, silverish crystals in finer grain matrix with no vesicules. Dr.
    Gast said rock could be rapidly crystallized igneous rock, very-
    high-grade metamorphic rock, or metamorphic rock that had been at
    temperatures of 1000Â°C (1300 K) long enough to be completely re-
    crystallized.
       Dr. William R. Muehlberger of Univ. of Texas and US. Geological
    Survey expressed surprise at â€œthe tremendous number of clasts [rock
    fragments] â€ within rocks. Clasts represented â€œcrustal material hauled

   briefed House Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee
   on Space Science and Applications on Applications Technology Satel-
   lites F and G and Synchronous Meteorological Satellite. Projects had
   been reported to be experiencing technical and cost problems. NASA
   review had found in ATS project â€œconsiderable progress has been made
         .                     .
    in . . completion of . . thermal structural model. Other elements,
   such as the integrated communications transponder, were not keeping
   pace . . . significant imbalance had developed in the total project. It
   has been necessary then to reschedule and reestablish the proper
   phasing between project elements.â€ Manpower and expenditure rates
   had been reduced, management changes had been made, and reporting
    arrangements had been strengthened. Reduced project content would
   provide for protoflight ATS-F and required integration and testing.
       â€œThese actions are expected to be completed this summer. Our
    appraisal . . . is that the ATS-F launch will occur in the early spring
    of 1974 with ATS-G to follow in a year to eighteen months.â€ Costs
    were expected to remain within FY 1973 estimate of $180 million to
    $215 million exclusive of $48.4-million vehicle costs.
       Review of SMS had confirmed need for correction in funding and
    scheduling because of introduction of advanced design features not
    adequately assessed in program definition. â€œPrimary emphasis is now
    being placed on completing engineering model verification tests during
    . . . this year to insure an orderly initiation of the production phase
    in early FY 1973.â€ NASA had established and was monitoring milestone
    schedules, had strengthened contractorâ€™s project management organi-
    zation-including change in project manager and transfer of key
    NASA personnel to organization-and had improved flow of information
    between NASA and contractor to improve project visibility. Parts pro-
    curement was proceeding satisfactorily after â€œspecial remedial attention.â€
    SMS development schedule would be 33 mos, placing launch of SMS-A
    in early fall of 1973. Second spacecraft, SMS-B, was scheduled to be
    launched five months later. SMS-B total runout cost was estimated at
    maximum $50 million exclusive of $8.4-million vehicle cost, reflecting
    FY 1973 reprogramming requirement of $4.5 million. â€œI believe that
    this project is now proceeding on a sound basis and will prove to
    be a very significant addition to NOAAâ€™s [National Oceanic and Atmos-
    pheric Administrationâ€™s] weather satellite system.â€ (Testimony)
* Discovery that calcium chloride concentration in brackish waters of ponds

    Morelli had concluded that any water found on Mars might be as salty
    and sterile. They had successfully grown microorganisms in Antarctic
    soil samples, but no form survived when kept in pond water. â€œIn
    this environment,â€ Dr. Cameron said, â€œthe capacity of life to adapt and
    survive is pushed to its limit and beyond. The concentration of living
    things around water sources in the dry valleys and their thinning out
    and final disappearance on the cold, dry slopes may provide the

    Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space met to plan program
    for parent Committee. Italian space expert Franco Fiorio asked 28
    members present if scientists from smaller countries would be allowed
    to stand in line and buy tickets to board Soviet or US. manned space
    laboratory. Dr. Fernando Mendonca of Brazil said advances in space
    technology were providing data that could help speed economic devel-
    opment in poorer countries but U.N. itself had neither technical
    manpower nor finances to assist these countries in using data. During
    debate over remote sensing by satellite, Sweden tried to open discussion
    of what U.N. could do to protect economic interests of small nonspace
    power from possible commercial exploitation by countries collecting
    data from satellites. Only Argentina supported Swedish view ; majority,
    including US. and U.S.S.R., said such discussions were premature.

May 8: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, discussed space pros-
    pects in interview published in U S . News & World Report: Chances
    of joint US. and U.S.S.R. mission were â€œquite good.â€ It hadnâ€™t been
    decided â€œexactly how it would work, but there might be two or three
    astronauts and the same number of cosmonauts.â€ U.S.S.R. probably
    would be â€œvery activeâ€ in manned space flight until U S . space shuttle
    was flying in 1978. â€œSo it may appear that we have lost our leadership
    during that period.â€ U.S.S.R. would â€œtry to be first in something-
    probably with manned and unmanned missionsâ€ during 1974 to 1978.
    â€œIf and when they land men on the moon-even if they land on the
                ..    . where we landed-that would attract a lot of public
    same side
    attention. . . . If they were to land on the far side of the moon, that
    would be even more spectacular.â€ It would also be spectacular, Dr.
    Fletcher said, if U.S.S.R. announced it was â€œputting up a space station
    as the first step in a program to get to Mars.â€
        Gap in US. space proqram had been caused by â€œseries of thingsâ€
     including cancellation of two Apollos. â€œWe probably should have
     worked it so that the shuttle would be operating earlier, but we spent
                                                                 . .â€

     a lot of time studying the shuttle-and                               Only
     possible fill-in was to â€œfly more Apollo components, and we are looking
     at that possibility. We have leftover Saturn rockets and leftover eom-
    mand-and-gervice modules. and weâ€™re looking to see if they can be
     used between 1974 and 1978.â€ It would take another Sputnik to
     accelerate US. space program to peak force, â€œbut I donâ€™t see that itâ€™s
     necessary. . . . I honestly think that we could do a reasonably good
     job on the budget that weâ€™ve programmed for the â€™70s. I think the
     main problem with the five-year gap is going to be loss of national
     prestige during the period.â€ Space program critics and decreasing
     space budget â€œmay have a negative impact on people wanting to stay
     with the space program.â€ If there were no gap-filling missions, â€œwe
     may have to phase part of the astronaut group into some other kinds
     of work while we wait for the shuttle.â€ When shuttle was operational
     it would â€œenable us to make space flight a routine event. Maybe weâ€™ll
     have an every Monday-morning flight out to space. This will change
     the nature of what we do in space completely. When we can get into

  Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial adapted from paper by
     Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator, presented views
     on future trends in space: Decade of 1970s would see emphasis on
     â€œbeneficial returns from our investments in the first decade of the
     space age. It will also be a decade in which we will consciously seek
     to avoid the large funding peaks that characterized the Apollo era.â€
     Number of achievements possible within limited budgeting would
     be limited. â€œIn the science arena, and in particular in the exploration
     of the solar system, this will mean some effort on extending our explora-
     tion of earth-like planets. And that will be about it, unless some
     circumstances again change our emphasis on space science.â€ In 1980s

  Dr. Aleksander P. Vinogradov, Vice President of Soviet Academy of
    Sciences, presented report on Luna 20 samples to Academy. He had
    earlier, on May 4, published data on soil sample in Prawda. Luna 20
    had landed near moonâ€™s Apollonius Crater in mountainous area between
    Sea of Crises and Sea of Fertility and returned to earth with lunar
    samples. Luna 20 soil was light grey, porous consertal (of texture
    in which irregular crystals interlocked) material containing fewer
    glassy, fused particles than Luna 16 samples from Sea of Fertility.
    Average particle size was 70-80 millimicrometers with largest particle
    in excess of one millimeter. Albedo value was higher than for samples
    returned by Luna 16, Apollo 11, or Apollo 12.
       Basic mass of particles were anorthositic rock containing large
    amount of feldspar, metallic iron, and olivine. â€œThe lunar samplesâ€™
    surprise proved to be the presence of pulverized metallic iron, which
    ...  does not oxidize, as distinct from terrestrial iron. This discovery
    may be of great practical significance. We have shown experimentally
    that under certain conditions it is possible to obtain such iron in the
    laboratory from basalts. If we succeeded in developing cheap tech-
    nology for the industrial production of inoxidizable iron, this would
    give technology a magnificient construction material.â€ Understanding
    nature of formation of anorthosites would be of even greater signifi-
    cance. â€œPerhaps it will even elucidate the most ancient history of our
    planet. A popular hypothesis once existed among geologists that the
    earthâ€™s crust originally consisted of anorthosite rocks. NOW it has
    unexpectedly received strong â€˜corroborationâ€™ from the moon.
       â€œAfter study of the lunar rock the nocturnal luminary appears before
    us as a â€˜twofaced Janus.â€™ On the moonâ€™s visible side vast territories
    are occupied by basaltic seas, while the entire far side is practically
    a solid continent, apparently formed from anorthositic rocks. Such a
    sharp difference is one of the moonâ€™s most exciting secrets.â€ (Zzwestiya,

   formation might have been formed from volcanic lava. Samples had
   very high concentrations of aluminum and calcium-26~~o/o aluminum
   oxide and 15% calcium-â€œvery different from what we see everywhere
   on the surface of the earth.â€
       X-rays of core tubes showed dispersion throughout soil of metal
   particles-probably metallic iron-up to 0.5 cm (0.2 in) in diameter.
   Tentative conclusion was â€œthat metallic iron, both in the soil and
   the rocks, is very much more abundant at this site than itâ€™s been at any
   other site on the moon and this may be a qualitative Characteristic
   of the Apollo 16 site and perhaps a qualitative characteristic of the
   highlands is that rocks there contain bits of metallic iron. It is
   tempting to speculate that this has something to do with the high
   magnetic field at this region.â€™â€™ Although scientists couldnâ€™t tell just
   from looking at rocks whether any were volcanic, â€œthe opinion is

May 16-17: Conference on Aircraft Engine Noise Reduction was held at
    Lewis Research Center to present latest results of NASA Quiet Engine
    Program and efforts to reduce noise of future short takeoff and landing
     (STOL) aircraft to airline industry representatives. Roy P. Jackson,
    NASA Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and Space Technology,
    said future of civil aviation depended on â€œmaking the airplane ac-
                              .                      ..
    ceptable to the community . . in noise level and . engine emissions.â€
             goal was to provide technology to make aircraft Lâ€˜unobtrusive
    NASAâ€™s
    in its environment. Noise levels beyond the airport boundaries should
    one day be indistinguishable in the ambient level.â€ Primary work in
    propulsion-source noise reduction was â€œtechnology to modify existing
                 .                                          .
    engines and . . to design new propulsion systems . . that operate
    at significantly lower noise levels.â€ NASA also was working on steep
    approaches in landing to reduce ground noise and studying community
    response to noise.

May 16-17


       Flight tests in 1971 with modified American Airlines Boeing 720
   aircraft from Stockton (Calif.) Metropolitan Airport in clear weather
   had shown â€œcockpit modifications made procedure of reducing ground
   noise by effecting steeper approaches in terminal area safe, repeatable,
   and reasonable under clear-weather conditions.â€
       Carl C. Ciepluch, Deputy Manager of L ~ R C Quiet Engine Project
    Office, discussed first tests, in May, of experimental engine A with
   acoustic nacelle and 97 900-newton (22 000-lb) thrust. LeRC had tested
    engine A at takeoff and landing speeds when noise was most noticeable.
    Tests had shown that if four such engines were installed on DC-8 or
    Boeing 707 aircraft takeoff noise would be 90 effective perceived noise
    in decibels (epndb) instead of 116 on takeoff and 118 on approach
   with current DC-8 and Boeing 707 engines. Although not suitable for
    wide-bodied jets, quiet engine and nacelle was 8 to 13 epndb quieter
    than engine used on Boeing 747s and DC-10s. Testing of engine with
    nacelles would continue through fall to measure more precisely effec-
    tiveness of noise suppression techniques and measure engineâ€™s internal
    noise sources other than the fan. Late in year, engine would be tested
    in a new altitude chamber at Lewis. Second quiet engine was under-
    going aerodynamic tests by manufacturer General Electric Co. at
    Peebles, Ohio, before being delivered to LeRC at end of year for acoustic
    tests. NASA would use evaluation of both engines in designing quiet
    experimental engine Mark I1 for â€œoptimum trade-off period noise
    reduction and installed weight penalty for aircraft application.â€
        Newell D. Sanders, Chief of LeRC V/STOL and Noise Div., chaired
    conference and discussed noise levels, methods for noise reduction,
     and quiet engine principles. (LeRC Release 72-29; Text; Lewis News,

0 Ames Research Center scientist Dr. Robert T. Jones was testing theory

   that antisymmetrical wing pivoting on center point might convert
    aircraft to supersonic transport without high fuel consumption and
    noise of conventional SST, NASA announced. Aircraft would have con-
   ventional straight wing at right angles to fuselage during takeoff on
   medium-length runways and would require about one fourth the takeoff
    energy needed by comparable delta-wing jet transports with similar
    payloads. As aircraft reached speed and altitude where swept wings
    were efficient, entire wing would rotate about 45â€ so that wing on one
    side would point in direction of flight and wing on other side would
    trail. Studies had indicated that cruising in this configuration at super-
    sonic speeds to mach 1.2 would not produce sonic boom and could
    be accomplished with fuel economy similar to that of current jet
    aircraft at subsonic speeds. Conceptual aircraft could cruise up to
    mach 1.5 over ocean where sonic effects were not detrimental. ARC

The fan jet transportâ€™s wing would rotate 45â€ or more above a center pivot as the
speed increased, in attempt to achieve supersonic speed without high fuel comsumption
and noise. By taking off with the wing perpendicular to the fuselage, the aircraft

    had said that â€œdecade ended with an adventure so fantastic as almost
    to overshadow and redeem all the turmoil that had scarred it.â€™, Re-
    deeming adventure had been Apollo 1 moon landing, which Dr.
                                             1
    Fletcher called â€œthe one great event of the decade that gave the
    American people renewed faith in their destiny.â€
       William M. Magruder, special consultant on technology to President
   Nixon, said U.S. had lost any chance of competing for first airline
    supersonic transport orders. He predicted US. would produce â€œsecond
   generationâ€ SST that would begin carrying passengers in a decade.
       L/G Otto J. Glasser (USAF), Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and
    Development, said in speech that US. aerospace industry had become
    (6
      overbuilt, overmanned, and overmanaged. Not only are there too
   many companies, but collectively they have more production capacity
   than we have any conceivable future need for. The passing of relatively
    ineffective . . . DC-3s and P-51s has gradually rendered obsolete and
    archaic our production oriented industry.â€ Gen. Glasser recommended
   that US. firms follow European approach of â€œvery small, tightly
    integrated design teams manned by top-of-their-graduating-class en-
    gineers.â€ (Texts; NYT, 5/23/72)
May 23: Scientists at Manned Spacecraft Center detonated by radio
    command three of four explosive mortar charges left on moon by
   Apollo 16 astronauts. Fourth grenade was not detonated because
    data indicated attitude sensor might have been knocked out of position
   by previous firings. Analysis of data on pitch sensor was under way
   to determine if sensor had failed or if mortar package had shifted its
   position. First grenade contained 270 g (0.6 lb) of explosive with
   predicted range of 910 m (3000 f t ) . Second had 45 g (0.1 lb) and
    150-m (500-ft) predicted range. Third had 140-g (0.3-lb) charge
    and 300-m (1000-ft) predicted range. Signals from three explosions,
   recorded by geophones left on lunar surface, indicated that moonâ€™s
    surface layer was at least 50 m (164 ft) thick. (MSC Release 72-112;

* NASAâ€™s TF-SA aircraft, equipped with supercritical wing and piloted
   by Thomas C. McMurtry, completed flight from Flight Research Center.
    Flight was made with wing vortex generators off at constant g of
    200 from mach 0.50 to 0.99 and altitudes of 4800 to 14 000 m (16 000
   to 46 000 ft). Windup turns and a few stick pulses with augmentation
   system off were performed. Pilot reported no significant differences
   in handling qualities and buffeting between flight with vortex genera-
   tors on and off but said pitch seemed softer with generator off. (NASA

    meet each year alternately in Washington and Moscow.
       Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of Medical Science and
    Public Health was signed by Secretary of State William P. Rogers and
    Soviet Minister of Health Boris V. Petrovsky. Parties agreed on
    joint efforth to combat most widespread and serious diseases, solve
    problems of effect of environment on manâ€™s health, and resolve other
    important health problems. Agreement would be implemented by
    coordinated research, exchange of specialists and delegations, organi-

* NASA announced start of development of space experiment to test equiva-
    lence principle of Einsteinâ€™s general theory of relativity. Principle
    asserted that pull of gravity and oppositely directed mechanical
    acceleration could not be distinguished in small region of space. Thus,
    when two identical clocks were in areas with different gravitational
    pull, clock rates would appear to be different, although rates them-
    selves would not change. Gravitational Redshift Space Probe Equipment
    would be launched from Wallops Station on Scout-D rocket in late
    1974. â€œGravitational redshiftâ€ was term for decrease or shift toward
    red spectrum as a light wave escaped from strong gravitational field
    of sun or other massive body toward weaker gravitational field.
       Clock in experiment would follow 31/-hr elliptical flight trajectory
    over Atlantic and would always be in weaker gravitational field than
    identical clock at Bermuda ground station. Frequency of clock in probe,
    as observed by telemetry, should appear greater than frequency of
    clock on ground and rate should appear to increase as strength of
    gravitational field decreaged up to 18 000-km (11000-mi) altitude
    and decrease as it returned to stronger field at lower altitudes. Differ-
    ence between experimental and ground-based clock rates would be
    compared with shifts predicted by Einsteinâ€™s theory. Hydrogen maser
    clocks for experiment would be developed by Smithsonian Astro-
    physical Observatory under direction of Marshall Space Flight Center.

* Astronauts Edgar D. Mitchell and James B. Irwin announced plans to
    resign from NASA and military. Mitchell, Navy captain, had been
    lunar module (LM) pilot on ApoZZo 14 (Jan. 31-Feb. 9, 1971). Irwin,
    Air Force colonel, had been LM pilot on Apollo 15 (July 26-Aug. 7,
    1971) and was backup pilot for Apollo 17, scheduled for launch in
    December. Because of Irwinâ€™s plans to retire, new backup crew for
    Apollo 17 had been named, effective July 1: John W. Young, Stuart
    A. Roosa, and Charles M. Duke, Jr. Original Apollo 17 backup crew
    was David R. Scott, Alfred M. Worden, and Irwin. Scott, Worden,
    and Thomas K. .Mattingly I1 had been assigned to Space Shuttle Pro-
    gram in Manned Spacecraft Center Astronaut Office. MattingIy, who
    recently had become a father, had requestedâ€™assignment which would
    allow him more time with his family during next six months. (NASA

    System collected and recycled wash water, cabin condensate, human
    waste, cabin trash, and foods, along with containers, clothing items
    and other nonmetallic scrap. At least 98% of all liquid waste proc-
    essed by system was recoverable as sterile water. Solid waste was
    incinerated into ash with volume 100 times less than original product.

       â€œArticle 4. The Parties will encourage international efforts to re-
    solve problems of international law in the exploration and use of
    outer space for peaceful purposes with the aim of strengthening the
    legal order in space and further developing international space law
    and will cooperate in this field.
       â€œArticle 5. The Parties may by mutual agreement determine other
    areas of cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for
    peaceful purposes.
       â€œArticle 6. This Agreement shall enter into force upon signature
    and shall remain in force for five years. It may be modified or ex-
    tended by mutual agreement of the Parties.â€
       Plans for joint US-U.S.S.R. rendezvous and docking mission were
    outlined in Fact Sheet issued by White House Press Secretary in
    Moscow: â€œUnder todayâ€™s agreement both sides commit to the develop-
    ment of a complete project schedule, and to meeting that schedule.
    Arrangements will be made for the necessary contact and understanding
    between specialists. . . . Training exercises will be conducted in [each]
    country for the other countryâ€™s flight crew and ground operations
    personnel.â€ Working groups would meet in July to plan engineering
    aspects of mission. Persons directly participating in flight operations
    of test mission would be included in working groups two years before
    mission. During mission each countryâ€™s control center would be ex-
    pected to control its own craft, but on decisions affecting joint elements
    of program-including countdown coordination-consultations            would
    occur with other country. â€œThere will be preplanned contingency
    courses of action. Television down-link will be transmitted to the
    other countryâ€™s control center, and voice communications between
    vehicle and ground will be available to the other countryâ€™s control
    center on a pre-planned basis.â€ Flight crews would be trained in other
    countryâ€™s language at least well enough to understand it and act in
    response during normal and contingency courses of action. Apollo
    command and service module ( C S M ) and Saturn IB booster would
    be used. Additional cost of mission to US. would be about $250 million.
    Project Directors would be Glynn S. Lunney, Assistant to Apollo
    Program Manager for Operations, Experiments, and Government Fur-
    nished Equipment at Manned Spacecraft Center, and Soviet Acad-
    emician K. D. Bushuyev. (Texts)
* Signin? of space cooperation agreement in Moscow was announced
    by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew at Washington, D.C., press briefiG

    ment Furnished Equipment at Manned Spacecraft Center; and Apollo
    9 Astronaut James A. McDivitt, Special Assistant for Organizational
    Affairs to MSC Director. Dr. Fletcher said: â€œWe . . . are very pleased
    that the President has been able to meet with the officials of the Soviet
    Union and to provide what we think is by far the most meaningful
    cooperation in space achieved ever by these two nations.â€
       Dr. Fletcher described rendezvous and docking of Apollo space
    craft and Soviet Soyuz spacecraft as â€œperhaps the most dramaticâ€
    commitment under cooperation agreement. Spacecraft were at present
    incompatible â€œbecause they have different atmospheres. Theirs is a

      normal atmosphere, ours is a low pressure oxygen             atmosphere
      and there are certain communications and electronics incompatibili-
      ties.â€ Spacecraft would be made compatible by docking module, new
      device constructed by NASA to link spacecraft. Apollo spacecraft would
      be launched on Saturn IB rocket. â€œThen we will make a maneuver at
                                                      .
      100 miles [160 kilometers] or so altitude, . . go in and pick out
      the docking adaptor from the Saturn and then continue on in orbit.
                                                          ..
      Meanwhile the Soviets will launch their Soyuz .        [and] rendezvous
      or at least move their altitude to something like 150 miles [240
      kilometers]. We wonâ€™t be at the same altitude, but hopefully we will
      be far enough north so too much maneuvering will not be required.â€
      Rendezvous would be performed primarily with US.-developed
      guidance and instrumentation. Then spacecraft would dock with â€œnew
               ..  . mechanism we call androgynous, because it doesnâ€™t
      kind of
                                         .
      consist of a prop and a drogue. . . It is an inverse docking mechanism
      s9 they can dock with us or we can dock with them either way.â€ System
      â€œwill apply not only to this . . . mission, but all succeeding spacecraft
       .
      . . so that we do have the capability, over a long period, of rendez-
      vousing and docking with each otherâ€™s spacecraft.â€
          Dr. Fletcher said original plan to attempt rendezvous and docking
      with Soviet Salyut space station had been canceled when U.S.S.R.
      â€œfound that was a very complicated mission because it involved not
       just two launches, their Soyuz and our APOLLO, but a third of their
      Salyut.â€ Universal docking system using docking adaptor between
      Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft had been selected because â€œthere has
      been concern for many years that we did not have a rescue capability
      . . . in space [so] that we each would have the option of rescuing
      the other. Future spacecraft beyond 1975, which is the planned date
      for this mission, will all have the capability.â€
          Total cost of project was estimated at $250 million. Fringe benefits
      from US.-U.S.S.R. joint program were: â€œIt does have the impact of
                                                  .
       requiring 4,400 people to be employed . . primarily from the aero-
      space industry, partly to prepare the command service model and the
      Saturn 1B launch device, but also to construct the new docking
                                                                     .
       adaptor,â€ and â€œit will keep the APOLLO team together . . through
       1975 in preparation for the first launch of the shuttle . . . in 1978.â€
      NASA was optimistic that cooperative space effort â€œmay lead to greatly
      increased cooperation on still other programs.â€ Joint mission would
      be â€œmost visibleâ€ US.-U.S.S.R. cooperative effort in history, â€œsince
       it will involve cosmonauts and astronauts working together on a very
       complex mission in space while the whole world is watching, pre-
       sumably on television via satellite relay.â€ (Transcript)

    held Moscow press conference following signing of US.-U.S.S.R.
    space and science and technology agreements. Petrov said: â€œIt is
    difficult to overestimate the importance of these works, this research,
    which has pursued humane goals of ensuring the safety of space flights.
    The concluded agreements give ground for the belief that these direc-
    tions in Soviet-American cooperation in outer space will develop
    successfully in the future.â€ Kirillin said of science and technology
    agreement: â€œI think that if we get down to the realization, to the

     complexes within capital area. Interim agreement froze production of
     ICBMS for five years or until full treaty was negotiated, if earlier.
     Possession of ICBMS was limited to those already deployed or under
     construction-1054 for US. and 1618 for U.S.S.R. Agreement also
     froze construction of submarine-launched ballistic missiles for nuclear
     submarines beyond those already begun. New construction of IcBMs,
     submarine missiles, or modern ballistic missile submarines would
     require dismantling equal number of older ones.
         Agreements left both nations with near-parity in nuclear weapon
      strength. US. would lead in strategic bombers with 460, with 140 for
      U.S.S.R.; both countries would have 2500 delivery vehicles; and Soviet
      megatonnage would be triple that of US. but US. would have some
      advantage in warheads. Each country would use â€œnational technical
      means of verification,â€ rather than on-site means, to monitor compli-
      ance with treaty terms. Baltimore Sun said later that means intended
      were â€œobviously spy satellites that use photographic and other means
      to check on developments in each country.â€

    were underway . it was assumed that the 1975 joint manned space

    the exclusive domain of a single nation or even a small group of

0 Achievements of US-U.S.S.R.        summit meetings in Moscow to date were
    summarized in New York Times article by Max Frankel. US. and
    Soviet officials had â€œduly signed the agreements that had been specially
    packaged for the occasion. Some, on cooperative ventures in health
    research, environmental control, scientific cooperation and a link-up
    of astronauts in space, had been merely rewritten or upgraded from
    earlier agreements, to add to the cumulative sense of achievement.
    One of the accords, to avoid naval harassment and incidents at sea,
    had been negotiated under the deadline of the summit.â€ Another, on
    trade, had become â€œtoo complicated to resolveâ€ and was â€œearmarked
    for energetic followup this summer.â€ Agreement to limit construction
     of defensive and offensive nuclear weapons â€œwas finally finished in a
     whirlwind round of all-night sessions.â€ Main premises behind summit
    meeting were â€œthat the two superpowers are now truly strategic equals,
     that they both have enough invulnerable weapons to deter nuclear
     attack, that they need to stop adding more weapons before they can
     reduce the number of weapons, that they both can use the money they
     might eventually have for better purposes, that they must avert even
     indirect conflicts that might draw them into war, and that they must
     collaborate more broadly in other fields to avoid the intrusions of
     inevitable conflicts of interest and conflicts among smaller nations.â€

    telescope 42 km (26 mi) in diameter, plus increased support of smaller
    radio programs at universities or research laboratories; (2) optical
    program to increase efficiency of existing telescopes with electronic
    auxiliaries, while creating new large telescopes to research limits of
    known universe; (3) increased support and development of infrared
    astronomy, including construction of large, ground-based infrared
    telescope, high-altitude balloon surveys, and design studies for very
    large atmospheric telescope; and (4) program for x-ray and gamma
    ray astronomy from High Energy Astronomy Observatories ( HEAOS)
    supported by ground-based optical and infrared telescopes.

    very large millimeter-wavelength antenna to identify and study com-
    plex molecules and to study quasars in their most explosive stages;
    doubling of support for astrophysical observations from aircraft,
    balloons, and rockets, at wavelengths from far infrared to gamma

  Lunar Samples Analysis Planning Team, using information imparted
    at Third Lunar Science Conference [see Jan. 10-131, reported in
    Science on advances made and problems still outstanding in lunar
    science. Most important gain had been that â€œwe now know there is a
    lunar crust.â€ Primal igneous activity in outer layers of moon had
     generated feldspathic crust 40 km (25 mi) thick. ApoZZo 15 core
     samples had shown that material at all levels had resided within few
     centimeters (one inch or so) of lunar surface at some time, but
     gradient in some cosmic ray product allowed tentative conclusion that
    soil in lower half of core had been stratified for 0.5 billion yrs.
     ApoUo 15 mission and Third Lunar Science Conference had answered
     many fundamental questions, but each answer raised new questions.
     â€œWhat are the nature and chronolom of rock types in the lunar
     highlands? Answers to date have been indirect or broadbrush. The
     most interesting epoch of lunar history, the first half-billion years, is
     recorded in highland rocks if it is preserved anywhere. Why is the
     occurrence of lunar norite or KREEP PO sharply restricted to the
     northwest quadrant of the moonâ€™s nearside? Is an exceptionally mighty
             . ..
     impact       required to raise noritic rock to the surface? This would
     be inconsistent with the supposedly shallow depth of origin of the Fra
    Mauro Formation cratering debris.â€

       Last two Apollo missions were targeted to regions that offered
    prospect of answering these questions. Most â€œprofound question of
    allâ€ was origin of earth-moon system. Apollo science had eliminated
    once-popular hypothesis that moon had been captured 1 to 2 billion
    yrs ago, â€œbut beyond this the question remains unanswered. If the
    nature of compositional heterogeneities in the moon at the time of its
    accretion can be inferred correctly from chemical and petrologic
    studies . ..this information will go far toward answering the question.â€
    Goal of understanding moon would be furthered by international
    cooperation. Third Lunar Science Conference had been â€œminor land-

     space progress at a cost the country can afford.â€ (4) Balanced program
     meant increased capability for â€œuseful work in all the major areas of
     space activity.â€ (5) â€œWe have chosen the re-usable Space Shuttle as
     our major investment in new space technology . . . and . . . have

     costs in half without significant losses in performance.â€ (6) â€œWe have

June 14: Press conference on scientific results of NASAâ€™s         Mariner 9
    Mars probe (launched May 30, 1971) was held at Jet Propulsion
    Laboratory. Dr. Robert H. Steinbacher, project scientist, said Mars
    â€œused to be likened to earth in science fiction, and was compared to
    the moon after the first pictures from Mariner 4 in 1965. Now we are
    seeing that Mars has a character all its own. It is not earth-like
    or moon-like, it is Mars-like.â€
       Harold Masursky of US. Geological Survey said Mars could be
    divided into four major geological provinces: Nix Olympica-Tharis
    volcanic province with volcanoes up to 8 km (5 mi) high and 500 km
     (300 mi) in diameter; Ophir-Eos equatorial plateau region with faults
    and rifts 5 km (3 mi) deep; cratered and smooth terrains with large
    circular basins like lunar impact basins; and south polar cratered
    terrain covered with glacial sediment layers up to 100 m (330 f t )
    thick. Convincing evidence that water had played active role in
    evolution of Mars was shown in Mariner 9 photos of deep, winding
    channels that might have once been beds of fast-flowing streams.
    Masursky suggested two explanations for apparent heavy rains and
    floods on Mars in past: volcanic heat might have melted water ice

      clouds that appeared to have general west-to-east flow pattern, with

      clouds, associated with volcanoes. â€œThe clouds appear mostly in the

  Dr. Wilmot N. Hess, Director of National Atmospheric and Oceanic
    Administrationâ€™s Environmental Research Laboratories, outlined space
    modification techniques at international meeting of Society of Engi-
    neering Science in Tel Aviv, Israel. Techniques would modify near-
    earth space environment to make it safe for manned space flight.
       â€œIn the last few years experimenters have artificially modified the
    space environment. We can now produce artificial aurorae. We can
    change the population of the Van Allen radiation belt. We can
    artificially modify the ionosphere from the ground and our other ideas
    about artificial experiments for the future stretch as far as trying
    to copy the sweeping action being carried on naturally by Jupiterâ€™s
    moons.â€ Other possible man-made changes in near-earth space environ-
    ment included releasing beam of energetic particles from satellite to
    produce electromagnetic waves in space, injecting thermal plasma at
    high altitudes to change radiation population in space, and transmitting
    electromagnetic waves from earth to disturb particles trapped in Van
    Allen belt. Experiments would provide data on natural processes that
    caused geomagnetic storms on earth, permit improved predictions of
    radar clutter and quality of polar radio communications in future
    naturally occurring storms, permit modification or attenuation of
    naturally occurring storms, and enable scientists to make near-earth
    space environment .safe for prolonged manned space flight and study.

June 15: Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, and ApoZZo 16
    Astronauts Charles M. Duke, Jr., John W. Young, and Thomas K.
    Mattingly I1 met with President Nixon at White House to discuss
    April 16-27 ApoZZo 16 mission and joint US.-U.S.S.R. rendezvous
    and docking mission scheduled for 1975.
       Following discussion Dr. Fletcher and astronauts held press con-
    ference. Dr. Fletcher said President was â€œvery pleasedâ€ with progress
    made toward joint mission. â€œThe President particularly wanted to
    emphasize that . . . this is only the beginning of what he conceives
    as a long association with the Soviet Union in many other areas of
                           .
    space cooperation. . . we are busy working on other kinds of things
                                .
    that we can do together . . perhaps through the turn of the century,
    doing things together for economic reasons and because he feels
    strongly that the international aspect of this is important in improving
    relationships. If we can do this together, we can do other things
    together.â€ President also emphasized worldwide space cooperation.
       As areas for US-U.S.S.R. cooperation in future, Dr. Fletcher
    thought â€œthe ones we can be sure ofâ€ were â€œthe cooperative program
    on Mars [and] a new cooperative program on Venus, where we explore
    the upper atmosphere and the entire atmosphere and they explore
    the surface. We are going to be doing that together.â€ (Other NASA
    officials explained later these would be coordinated efforts rather than
    joint missions.)
       July meeting of principals at Manned Spacecraft Center would
    â€œiron out the managementâ€ of joint docking mission. Astronaut
    Young said that â€œreal problemâ€ was communication; â€œonce we solve
    that problem we can prove that we can work together in a lot of other
    areas besides.â€ Dr. Fletcher said plans for joint astronaut and cosmo-
    naut training had not been concluded, â€œbut it is going to be absolutely
    essential that the cosmonauts come over here and train on our equip-
    ment and vice versa. That much has been agreed to.â€ Training pro-
    gram probably would start â€œwithin about a year.â€ Dr. Fletcher summed
    up progress made on joint mission since May 24 signing of cooperation
    agreement: â€œWe have set up the agenda for the meeting which will
                                                  ..

* Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator, testified before House
    Committee on Science and Astronauticsâ€™ Subcommittee on International
    Cooperation in Science and Space on US.-U.S.S.R. agreement on
    cooperation in space [May 241. He described events that led to agree-
    ment on joint rendezvous and docking mission: Dr. Thomas 0. Paine,
    then NASA Administrator, had suggested to Soviet Academician Anatoly
    A. Blagonravov during April 1970 meeting in New York â€œpossibility
    of cooperation in the area of astronaut safety, including compatible
    docking fixtures for space stations and shuttles.â€ National Academy of
    Sciences President, Dr. Philip Handler, had conveyed NASAâ€™s       interest
    to Soviet Academy President Mstislav V. Keldysh. â€œIn July, Dr. Paine
     suggested directly to President Keldysh that this possibility be con-
     sidered.â€™, Dr. Low said if docking mission was successful, â€œboth
     countries will have increased their chances of rescuing astronauts in
     distress without commensurate increase in the costs of a standby rescue
     capability. It is here that the joint test mission is particularly im-
     portant. It will give us the opportunity to identify and resolve under
     the best possible conditions the problems we can expect to flow from
     differences in language, equipment, and operational procedures.â€
        Joint working groups were making significant progress. Space
     meteorology group was organizing experiments to advance tempera-
     ture sounding from satellites and microwave measurement of precipi-
     tation zones, ice conditions, and sea surface roughness and temperature.
     Another joint working group had provided for coordination of
     meridional sounding rocket networks in Eastern and Western Hemi-
     spheres and had begun to exchange operational and scientific meteoro-
     logical data. Working group on natural environment was defining
     coordinated experiments in remote sensing of the environment related
     to vegetation, geology, and the oceans. Oceanographic effort would
     continue satellite and ship measurements over same ocean area. In
     group on scientific investigation of near-earth space, moon, and
     planets, â€œexperts from both sides have been working on a common
     system of lunar coordinates and a propram for compiling a com-
     plete map of the moon on the scale of 1:5,000,000.â€ Group on space
     biology and medicine was â€œconsidering certain common standards and
     procedures to increase the comparability of information.â€
         If US. and U.S.S.R. could work together to achieve â€œintimate and
      complex common goalâ€ like joint space mission, â€œwe will have built
     mutual confidence and trust. The symbol of US and Soviet spacemen
     meeting in orbit before the eyes of the entire world cannot help but
      ameliorate attitudes, viewpoints and expectations throughout the world.â€

     military situation is sound. Much of the criticism has focused on the
     imbalance in number of missiles.â€ To assess overall balance â€œit is
     necessary to consider those forces not in the agreement; our bomber
     force which is substantially larger and more effective than the Soviet
     bomber force, and our forward base system.â€ US. had â€œmajor ad-
     vantage in nuclear weapons technology and in warhead accuracy.â€
     With its multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVS) ,
     US. had two-to-onelead in warheads. Lead would be maintained during
     agreement period, â€œeven if the Soviets develop and deploy MIRVâ€™s    of
     their own.â€ U.S.S.R. had more missile launchers than US., â€œbut
     when other relevant systems such as bombers are counted there are
     roughly the same number of launchers on each side. We have a big
     advantage on warheads. The Soviets have an advantage on megaton-
     nage.â€ What was disadvantageous to US. was â€œtrend of new weapons
     deploymentâ€ by U.S.S.R. and â€œprojected imbalance 5 years hence
    based on that trend.â€ Relevant question was â€œwhat the freeze prevents;
     where would we be by 1977 without a freeze?â€ Considering current
    Soviet momentum in intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-
    launched ballistic missiles, â€œceiling set in the Interim Agreement can
    only be interpreted as a sound arrangement that makes a major con-

   Wall Street Journal article criticized â€œstrange aspects to NASAâ€™s       push
     for the shuttle.â€ Economic estimates of cost were â€œtroublesome.â€ Some
     critics had charged that development costs might be â€œtwo to four
     times the $6 billion estimate of NASA. And the operating cost may not
     be as cheap as NASA says.â€ â€œStrangestâ€ aspect of NASA argument
     was â€œagencyâ€™s almost total silence on the one space project for which
     the shuttle makes real sense-the permanent orbiting space station.â€
     It had been assumed space station would be â€œkeystone of any long-
     range space effort involving menâ€ from beginning of space program.

     ment program for â€œusefulâ€ space shuttle than $U-billion program for
     space station. But NASAâ€™s   â€œselling spielâ€ was â€œsomewhat misleading.â€
     Once $6-billion development program was finished shuttle would go into
      routine operation. â€œPlans call for 30 to 40 flights a year for 10 years.

    gered,â€™ anti-Soviet space supporters in Congress, who proceeded to pare

    was adjudged successful by NASA. Spacecraft had carried eight experi-
    ments into highly elliptical orbit to study dynamic processes in inner
    magnetosphere from two to five earth radii. After six months in orbit
    all experiments and spacecraft systems were operating satisfactorily,
    excellent data had been received, and mission had exceeded its objec-

June 20: NASA held press conference on ERTS-A Earth Resources Tech-
    nology Satellite (to be launched July 23) at Goddard Space Flight
    Center. Dr. Arch B. Park, Chief of NASA Earth Resources Survey

    between the results of the experiment and the interest             of the
    general public.â€ Most important experiments were in land use and
    understanding geology, soils, vegetation, and engineering aspects of
    manâ€™s mass works. Second was environmental awareness, including
    experiments in biological control of pests, water quality, mine safety,
    forest conservation, and resources management.
        Primary objective of ERTS was described by project manager Wil-
     fred E. Scull as â€œthe acquisition of multi-spectral imagesâ€ over U.S.
     and rest of world and use of data for various disciplines. Spacecraft,
     scheduled for launch July 21, would weigh 939 kg (2070 lbs) and
     would be launched into sun-synchronous, circular earth orbit at 920-
     km (570-mi) altitude, repeating coverage under same conditions of
     illumination over entire globe every 18 days. Onboard equipment
     included three return-beam-vidicon (RBV) cameras that would take
     pictures every 25 sec, multispectral scanner subsystem ( MSS) that
     would continually scan ground directly beneath satellite, and two wide-
     band video tape recorders (WBVTR) to record and store images for
     later playback. Data-collection system consisted of remote platforms
     for measuring soil, water, and air quality and other environmental
     data and transmitting data to ERTS as it passed overhead. Data would
     be telemetered to three main stations (Fairbanks, Alaska; Goldstone,
     Calif.; and Greenbelt, Md.) and processed at GSFC. All images received
     by NASA would be sent to Dept. of Agriculture, Dept. of Interior, and
     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (Transcript)

June 22: Press conference on preliminary results of Apollo 16 experi-

    photo-geology team described metric camera photo of old, three-ring
    basin about 960 km (600 mi) in diameter on far side of moon. Eastern
    part of ring coincided with â€œwhat the Soviets had called some 10 years
                                               .
    ago right after the Luna 3 photographs . . the Soviet Mountains.â€
    NASA had concluded from Lunar Orbiter and Apollo 8 photos that
    formation was not mountains but â€œthe coincidence of very bright rays
    from two relatively young craters,â€ and U.S.S.R. had conceded to
    elimination of Soviet Mountains from lunar dictionary. Apollo 16
    photos showed, however, that â€œwhat we have here is really the Soviet
    Mountains rediscovered, so to speak, that is part of a middle ring of a
    very old basin.â€ Dr. El-Baz said that, pending approval of International
    Astronomical Union, large basin would be named Arabia in honor of
    Arab contributions to astronomy, eastern range of middle ring of
    basin would be called Soviet Mountains, and long western range of
    middle ring discovered by Apollo 16 would be called American Moun-
    tains.
        Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal investigator for passive seismic ex-
    periment, said May 13 meteorite impact on moon â€œmay well turn out
    to be the most important single seismic event the Apollo Network will
    record in its life unless the good fairy sends us another fragment of
    rock. It provided very important confirmation of the structure that
    we have proposed based on the S-IVB impact.â€ Seismometers had
     also recorded other meteorite impacts and dozens of moonquakes.
     â€œWeâ€™ve been able to establish at least the presence of 20 different
                                          ... have the familiar pattern which
    moonquake source locations. They
     can be correlated with lunar tides and hence are triggered by lunar
    tides.â€ Most puzzling question was what energy source within moon
     caused moonquakes. â€œWe donâ€™t have the answer to that, We do have the
    puzzling fact that the two source zones weâ€™ve located are nearly 900
                                   ..
     kilometers [560 miles] deep . the depth at which our very tentative
                                    .
    evidence places a reflector. . . there seems something special about
    that depth. All of the Moon above that depth within our network area,
                       .
     at least, must be . . solid. Very high frequency seismic waves can
     propagate through it. Such high frequencies are eliminated from ter-
     restrial earthquake signals by a partially molten low velocity zone.â€
     If part of moon were molten, â€œitâ€™s either in very, very small isolated
     pockets or at greater depth than 1000 kilometers [620 miles].â€

         Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of MSC Planetary and Earth Sciences Div.,
      said about 90% of ApoZZo 16 lunar samples consisted of aluminum-
     and calcium-rich material. â€œThe aluminum and calcium concentration
                                                            ...

                  .
     ponent o f . . anorthosite. They are very typical of what one finds in
     the highlands anywhere on the moon where we have any chemical
      data. Now, the negative side of that conclusion is that these rocks are
      not as had been thought prior to the mission, a kind of volcanic rock
                            ..
      that is rich in silica . a viscous volcanic rock. Itâ€™s quite definite
                                               .
      that the so-called Cayley formation . . is not a volcanic formation

      and I think we can generalize with some confidence that . it probably
      is not a volcanic formation in the other places on the moon where
                                                                            ..
      it has been identified or mapped in, either. There are a few rocks .
      which are distinctly differentâ€ from the rest in lower aluminum con-
      centration, 15 to 18 percent, and higher magnesium-iron concentration
      with composition that could be that of volcanic rocks. They were also
      high in potassium and phosphorus. From Apollo data scientists had
      identified four major types of rocks: grey breccias that contained black
      and white clasts (rock fragments) ; black feldspar rock that appeared
      under microscope to be igneous because it was tough and dense;
      very white cataclasites of crushed plagioclase-rich material ; and crys-
      talline rocks. One rock in ApoZZo 16 samples, â€œrusty rock,â€ was cov-
      ered by red, rust-like coating. Identification of rust, so far, was only
      visual; x-ray and mineralogical tests had not yet been made. â€œIt may
                      ..  . a more exotic type of iron compound than simple
      turn out to be

                                                   .    .
      something that took place on the Moon . . not . . in the spacecraft
      on the way back or from handling the rock. The coatings are dis-
      persed through the inside of the rock and too thick and too diverse
      to have been formed in the spacecraft.â€ (Transcript)

    â€œshould enhance safety and value of space flightâ€ and opened possi-
    bility of further areas of cooperation. It demonstrated â€œin full view
    of the world that the two great space powers have both the will and the
    capability to work together on important and difficult tasks. We have
                     .

       Dr. Low outlined earlier agreements and gave details of joint ren-
    dezvous and docking mission agreed on for 1975. During April visit
    to Moscow, rrgreement had been reached that astronauts must under-
    stand Russian to extent normally used in both regular and contingency
    operations. Soviet cosmonauts also would need to understand other
    language and be able to respond. Dictionary would be .developed of
    commonly used phrases. Some astronauts, all interested in flying this
    mission, had begun studying Russian on their own. Astronauts selected
    would take formal language training. Others in NASA would also learn
    Russian. (Transcript)

     is possible and no less important is the fact that such systems will enable
     the spacecraft of one country to come to the aid of crews of another
     countryâ€™s spacecraft should they be in distress. World science will
     be enriched not only by the experiment on the docking . . . but also
     by cooperation in many other fields. This includes joint work in the

    John S. Foster, DOD Director of Defense Research and Engineering,
    in 1971 had encouraged all military services to â€œlook for ways of using
    space systems to perform their jobs better and cheaper.â€™â€™ Air Force
    would continue launches but â€œwill no longer operate space systems of
    other services, nor will there be the requirement to develop their
    systems for them. The cooperation among the services on space matters
    is excellent, and, I believe, this change, which recognizes that space as
    a military medium has reached maturity, benefits everybody.â€ (AF

  National Science Foundation released Federal Funds for Research, De-
    velopment, and Other Scientific Activities, Fiscal Years 1970, 1971,
    1972 (NSF 71-35). Federal obligations for research and development
     (R&D) in 1970 totaled $15.3 billion excluding plant; slight rise to
     $15.4 billion was expected for 1971. Figure was decrease of 5% in
     constant dollars. Basic research obligations were expected to rise from
     $2.1 billion in 1970 to $2.2 billion for 1971 and $2.4 billion for 1972.
     Federal support for basic research declined in 1970 but was expected
     to reach new record highs for 1971 and 1972. Bulk of Federal basic
     research, 81%, was funded by NASA; Dept. of Health, Education, and
     Welfare; National Science Foundation ; Atomic Energy Commission;
     and Dept. of Defense. NASA had led in basic research support since
     1961, with 29% of total in 1971.
        Applied research obligations totaled $3.5 billion in 1970 and were
     expected to rise to $3.8 billion for 1971, increase of 8%. Total was
     expected to reach $4.2 billion in 1972-all-time high in current dollars.
     DOD, HEW, and NASA continued to dominate Federal applied research
     effort and would account for 78% in 1971. Obligations for development
     totaled $9.7 billion in 1970 and would decline 376, to $9.4 billion, in
      1971. In 1972, Federal development total was scheduled to rise to
     $10.0 billion, or 1966 level. DOD, NASA, and AEC were most prominent
     in Federal development effort in 1960-1972, accounting for 92% in
     1971. DOD funded 63% ; NASA share had declined since 1965 to expected
      19% for 1971.
        Although total Federal R&D obligations were expected to increase
     9% from 1970 to 1972, NASA and AEC decrease continued. NASA esti-
     mate for 1972, however, was smallest reduction since downward trend
     began in 1967. Report noted increases in key programs-Skylab,
      space shuttle, Viking Mars explorations, and unmanned missions to
      outer planets-had almost offset decreases in Apollo program. (Text)

July 1 : Proposal to produce rare bloodclot-dissolving enzyme urokinase
     aboard Apollo spacecraft during 1975 joint US-U.S.S.R. rendezvous
     and docking mission would be made to NASA by university-industry
     scientific team, Washington Post reported. Scientists from Abbott
     Laboratories, General Dynamics Corp. Convair Div., and Univ. of
     California at Los Angeles had suggested use of device developed by
     UCLA biophysicist Alexander Kolin that separated the one kidney cell
     out of every 19 that made urokinase. Device had been used successfully
     on earth, but team believed urokinase-producing cells could be isolated
     more effectively in space, where gravity did not hinder separation.
     Cells would be separated aboard spacecraft, ampuled, frozen, and
     brought back to earth, where enzyme would be produced by pharma-
     ceutical plant. If successful, method could reduce high cost of urokinase
     to $50 per dose. National Heart and Lung Institute had treated 236
     victims of pulmonary embolism with enzyme at more than $1000
     per patient. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 7/1/72, A3)
  Manned Spacecraft Center awarded two parallel, firm-fixed-pricecontracts
     for study of aircraft that could simulate subsonic flight characteristics

     $150 000 and Lockheed Aircraft Corp. Georgia Div. would receive
     $149 000 to provide sufficient data to assure NASA that proposed shuttle
     training aircraft was technically feasible and acceptable and that rec-
     ommended design could meet specified requirements. (MSC Release

* Tenth anniversary of first transoceanic TV via satellite-Telstar 1
    comsat built by American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and launched
    by NASA from Cape Canaveral (now Cape Kennedy), Fla. Millions of
    TV viewers had watched taped picture of American flag transmitted
    from Andover, Me., via Telstar 1 to Andover and Holmdel, N.J.
    Signals were also picked up by stations at Plemeur-Bodou, Brittany,
    and Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall. Within one week after launch
    Telstar 1 had transmitted first TV pictures from Europe and first
    pictures in color and, within one month, first international exchange
    of live TV. During four months of operation before it was disabled by
    radiation, satellite handled more than 400 transmissions, including
    5Q TV demonstrations, telephone calls and data in both directions,
    and facsimile material. It was revived in January 1963 for communi-
    cations tests.
       Telstar 1 was followed by Telstar 2 (launched May 7, 1963),
    2 Relays, 3 Syncoms, and 15 Intelsats and commercial traffic grew
    to more than 2500 hrs of TV per year and more than 4000 full-time,

July 11 : Viking parachute system to lower instruments onto Mars surface
     in 1976 was damaged during first in series of three high-altitude tests
     over White Sands Missile Range. Parachute was carried to 5900-m
      (19500-ft) altitude by large balloon and then boosted upward to
     supersonic speed by rocket. Damage had occurred when parachute
     deployed at 43 300-m (142 000-ft) altitude, where dynamic pressure
     reached 689.5 newtons per sq m (14.4 psf), instead of in thinner air
     at 45 300 m (148 500 f t ) with 598.5 newtons per sq m (12.5 psf) as
     planned. Objective was to demonstrate capability of parachute system
     at highest speed and most severe loading conditions expected at Mars.
     NASA said parachute would have functioned satisfactorily in actual
     Mars landing. Since launch was only partially successful, it would
     be repeated in August. [See July 26, Aug. 13 and 19, Dec. 14.1 (NASA

* Press conference on overall aspects of May 24 US.-U.S.S.R. space
     cooperation agreement was held at Manned Spacecraft Center during
     meetings of NASA and Soviet working groups [see July 6-18].
     Participants included Dr. George M. Low, NASA Deputy Administrator;
     Academician Boris N. Petrov, Chairman of Soviet Intercosmos Council;
     Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., MSC Director; and Arnold W. Frutkin,
     NASA Assistant Administrator for International Affairs.
         Dr. Low said â€œgreat dealâ€ had been accomplished in all areas
     covered by cooperation agreement. Working groups were meeting
     almost constantly. Nations had exchanged lunar samples from all
     flights through Apollo 15 and Luna 20 and were about to exchange
     samples on Apollo 16. Area of greatest interest was rendezvous and
     docking mission scheduled for 1975. Talks on joint mission were
     LC
        going extremely well.â€
         Petrov said Soviet people had been informed of plans for joint space
     flight â€œat the same time as the American peopleâ€-when             technical
     discussions were in progress. â€œOur press, just as your press, carried
     information on the discussions.â€ Asked if foreign press would be
     permitted to witness launch of Soviet Soyuz during joint mission,
     Petrov said both Apollo spacecraft and Soyuz launch would be con-
     ducted â€œunder the same conditions as all previous launches.â€ Question
     on control of mission was deferred to conference on joint rendezvous
     and docking mission scheduled for July 17, but Dr. Low said â€œgeneral
     principleâ€ would be that, â€œwhile the Soviet cosmonauts are visiting in
     our Apollo command module, we will be in command; when weâ€™re
                                                                        .
     visiting in their Soyuz, they will be in command of that ship . . and
     we will be under their command.â€ Petrov said he hoped, and was
     certain, â€œthat this first test flight will not be the last oneâ€ and that
     thekc xtrould be possibility of space rescue flights if needed, â€œregardless
     of what countryâ€™s spacecraft are involved.â€ If test flight was successful,
     Dr. LOW    said, â€œour plans are to equip the Space Shuttle with this kind
     of a docking system. We donâ€™t think that we will need a follow-on
     test but instead we will be flying operationally with compatible systems
     beyond that point.â€
         Asked to comment on Soviet Venus probe Yen, 8, launched March
     27, Petrov said spacecraft should reach planet at monthâ€™s end. â€œThat

                                         ..   . or place where transmission of

     Director for U.S.S.R. Lunney said that during series of meetings that
    had begun July 6, US. and U.S.S.R. had discussed and agreed on
     â€œthe technical content of three very important project level documentsâ€:
    project technical proposal that described mission and hardware ele-
    ments, organizational plan that described how countries would work
    together in controlling project before and during flight, and schedule
     of activities. Officials had also concluded â€œtechnically detailed docu-
     ments describing the agreements that weâ€™ve reached on various sys-

        Preliminary plans called for launch of Apollo spacecraft carrying
     three astronauts 735 hrs after launch of Soyuz with two cosmonauts.
     Second Soyuz would be ready as backup if Apollo could not be

    in identifying and solving those basic and important problems without

  Discovery by instruments aboard Uhuru (Explorer 42 Small Astronomy
    Satellite launched Dec. 12, 1970) of regular pulse rhythm in x-ray
    pulsar was reported by Washington Post. Pulsar discovered in con-
    stellation Hercules by Uhuru in November 1971 pulsed for 9 days;
    then stopped pulsing for 27 days, in repeated pattern. Cornel1 Univ.
    astronomer Dr. Frank D. Drake had said discovery was â€œevery bit
    as bewilderingâ€ as discovery of pulsar itself. â€œThere is no known
     reason why a star should disappear and then reappear at such regular
    and predictable times.â€ Possibilities advanced by astronomers included
    one that pulsar was orbiting another pulsar whose radio waves were
    unobservable by Uhuru and that second pulsar overwhelmed first for
    27 out of 36 days. Second possibility was that Hercules pulsar was
    outermost of two stars circling third star in egg-shaped orbits and
    that eccentric orbits and eclipsing behavior of second orbiting star
    kept Hercules pulsar hidden from earth three fourths of time. Third
    and most likely possibility was that pulsar wobbled off orbiting path
    around its fellow star so that it cast beam into space, away from
    earth, for 27 out of 36 days. (Oâ€™Toole, W Post, 7/17/72, A l )

 Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, discussed future
   air superiority aircraft in speech before Aero Club of Washington in
   Washington, D.C. Air Force had not developed new fighter aircraft
   that could maintain air superiority in battle area in 20 yrs, while
   U.S.S.R. had developed â€˜â€˜whole family of sophisticated fighters.â€ F-15
   program should give US. â€œwhat we need for the air superiority
   mission.â€ For allies, U.S. had developed F-5E international fighter,
   66
     a simple design that cost about half that of our present long-range,
   multipurpose aircraft.â€ It would â€œplay a particularly vital role in
                                                                    ..
   improving the self-defense capabilities of our Asian allies. . In
   modernizing our forces, we have learned an important lesson in the last
   few years. You cannot build an aircraft with every possible new tech-
   nological device and expect to buy enough of them to get the job
          ...
   done.        The unit cost of high performance aircraft has increased
   tenfold every 18 years.â€ Avionics was factor in driving up cost of
   new aircraft systems. F-111D included Mark I1 avionics system cost-
   ing over $4 million. To lower unit cost of systems, Air Force was
   tailoring new aircraft for â€œsomewhat narrower purposes.â€ Through
   specialization â€œwe hope to obtain aircraft that can both survive and
                                                               ..  . we will
   perform more effectively in their individual mission and
   be able to afford many more of these aircraft than we could obtain in
   the case of one super-capable, multipurpose plane.â€ (Text)

July 22: U.S.S.R.â€™s Venus 8 spacecraft, launched March 27, reached
     atmosphere of Venus after 117-day flight covering 482 million km
     (300 million mi). Tass said descent module separated from spacecraft
     and descended to surface of Venus by parachute, softlanding at
     2:29 pm Baykonur time (5:29 am EDT) . â€œIn the process of aerodynamic
     deceleration its speed dropped from 11.6 kilometers per second [7.2
    miles per second] to 250 metres per second [820 feet per second].
     Studies of the atmosphere and surface layer of the planet were con-
     ducted during the parachute descent for the fifty minutes after landing.
     Carried out for the first time were experiments to determine brightness,
     pressure and temperature in the atmosphere and on the surface of the
     planet on its day side. Data has been obtained on the nature of the
     rocks of the planetâ€™s surface layer.â€
        Venus 8 was second Soviet spacecraft to complete softlanding mission
    to Venus successfully. First was Yen, 7, which had landed capsule
     on Venus Dec. 15, 1970, that had transmitted data from surface for
     23 min. (FBIS-SOV, 8/24/72, L1; SBD, 7/25/72, 118; GSFC SSR,

Ju2y 23-25: Erts 1 (ERTS-A) Earth Resources Technology Satellite was
    launched by NASA from Western Test Range at 1 :06 am PDT by 2-stage
                                                      1
    Thor-Delta booster with nine strap-on rockets. Satellite entered circular,
    near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit with 906.9-km (563.6-mi) apogee,
    899.7-km (559-mi) perigee, 103.2-min period, and 99.1O inclination.
     Primary objective was to acquire for three months synoptic, multi-
     spectral repetitive images from which useful data would be obtained
     for investigations in agriculture and forestry resources, mineral and
    land resources, land use, water resources, marine resources, mapping
     and charting, and environment. As secondary objectives Erts 1 would
     acquire complete, largely cloud-free coverage of U.S. with multispectral
    scanner ( MSS) or return-beam-vidicon camera (RBVC) system, or
    both; acquire coverage over major earth land masses with MSS or
     RBVC; and demonstrate relay of data from remote ground-based
    platforms.
        The 941-kg (2075-1b), butterfly-shaped satellite carried RBV camera
                                                            ,

    band video tape recorders (WBVTR) Launch was first step in merging
     space and remote sensing technology to manage earth resources more
     efiiciently. Satellite would be able to cover earth with 500 pictures-
     1000 times fewer than 500000 needed to cover earth from high-
     altitude aircraft. Each picture would cover 34 000 sq km (13 000

    sq mi). Satellite would view 185-km (115-mi) strip of earth with
    global coverage every 18 days, crossing equator daily at about
    9:30 am local time.
       Solar array lock-on to sun and three-axis stabilization were achieved
    as planned. By July 25 instruments had been turned on and were
    operating satisfactorily. Initial imagery from RBVC system and MSS
    was excellent and showed detail.
        Data were being transmitted to stations at Fairbanks, Alaska;
    Goldstone, Calif.; and Greenbelt, Md.; and would be sent to data-
    processing facility at Goddard Space Flight Center. Ground station
    at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, constructed and operated by Canadian
    government, would also receive data. Data would be distributed in
    form of high-quality film images or digitized data on computer-readable
    magnetic tape.
        Unlike previous unmanned programs where principal investigators
    had own instrumentation on board spacecraft and were responsible for
     own data analysis, all Erts 1 investigators had access to all data from
    onboard instruments. The 300 investigators from 43 states, District of
     Columbia, 31 foreign countries, and two international organizations
    would be assisted by 25 specialists assigned by NASA to analyze results.
    To carry out research required to evaluate satellite techniques, NASA
    was working with user agencies-including Departments of Agriculture,
     Commerce, and Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, and US.
     Corps of Engineers-and        state and local organizations. Extensive
     cooperative earth resources projects had been established with Canada,
     Brazil, and Mexico, using Erts 1 and NASA earth observations aircraft.

July 26: NASA selected North American Rockwell Corp. (NR) Space Div.
     for negotiation of six-year, $2.6-billion cost-plus-fixed-and-award-fee
     contract as prime contractor to begin developing space shuttle orbiter.
     Increment covering first two years was $540 million. NR-selected
     from four firms submitting proposals-would be responsible for de-
     sign, development, and production of orbiter vehicle and for integration
     of all shuttle elements. Shuttle main engine was being developed by NR
     Rocketdyne Div. under earlier contract. External tank and solid-fueled
     rocket boosters would be procured by NASA after system engineering for
     orbiter had progressed sufficiently.
        Shuttle, first reusable space vehicle, would have delta-winged, air-
     plane-like orbiter able to land on conventional runways. It would have
     cargo compartment 18 m (60 ft) long and 4.5 m (15 ft) in diameter
     and would be able to place 29 500 kg (65 000 lbs) into 185-km (115-
     mi) due-east orbit. Reusable solid-propellant booster rockets and orbiter
     high-pressure, liquid-oxygen and liquid-hydrogen main engines would
     boost orbiter into space and booster rockets would detach at 40-km
      (25-mi) altitude and splash down in ocean for recovery and reuse.
     Orbiter, under own power, would continue into low earth orbit. Shuttle
     would be able to place satellites in orbit, return satellites from orbit,
     permit in-orbit repair and servicing of satellites, deliver propulsive
     stages and satellites to low earth orbit, and make short-duration science
     and applications missions with self-contained experiments in low earth
     orbit. Shuttle development schedule called for horizontal test flights
     beginning in 1976 and manned orbital test flights beginning in 1978,
     with complete system operational by 1980. Employment generated by
     orbiter development and shuttle integration was expected to reach
     15000 by 1975-1976 and then would gradually decrease. (NASA Re-

0 Preliminary data from U.S.S.R.â€™s     Venus 8 spacecraft, which landed on
    planet Venus July 22, was published in Moscow. Landing site tempera-
    ture was 738 K (465Â°C) and pressure was 93 atmospheres. Measure-
    ments of substances in clouds during descent suggested Venusian sur-
    face was undergoing â€œstormy volcanic actionâ€ and demonstrating same
    evolutionary characteristics as earth had many millions of years ago,
    which could explain high surface temperatures. Yen, 8â€™s ability to
    transmit from surface 27 min longer than Venus 7 had was attributed
    to freezing of descent module by ground command just before descent.

    perature was felt gradually irrespective of thermal pressure. (FBIS-SOV,

    Soyuz 11-Sdyut 1 mission, in which three cosmonauts died; pre- and
    postflight clinical-physiological examination procedures for cosmo-
    nauts; and theoretical aspects of predicting physiological responses of

    his firm was unsuccessful largely because its shuttle design was more
    â€œconservativeâ€ than that of NR. Gavin said NASA officials had consid-
    ered â€œmission suitabilityâ€ and not management problems as weakness
    in Grumman bid. Grumman design had more complex swing arms to
    hold shuttle stationary before launch and lacked â€œbackground with
    large cryogenic tankingâ€ used in shuttleâ€™s fuel supply. Grumman design

      science and its relation to society, made by Physics Survey Committee
      chaired by Yale Univ. physicist Dr. David A. Bromley. Report, tenta-
      tively titled â€œPhysics in Perspective,â€ was in press at release time.
      It rated 69 program areas in physics in order of priority and empha-
      sized cost to U.S. science and society and to physics if programs were
      not adopted. Most â€œstrikingâ€ aspect of survey had been â€œrenewed
      discovery of the over-all power and vitality of U.S. physics,â€ but â€œthis
      strength is in danger.â€ Committee found danger most immediate and
      obvious in subfields like elementary particle and nuclear physics where
      major facilities approved in mid-1960s were just becoming operational.
      Report named 15 programs that had growth potentials warranting
      high priority for incremental support: macroscopic quantum phe-
      nomena including superfluidity and superconductivity, quantum optics,
      scattering in solids and liquids, heavy-ion interactions, higher-energy
      nuclear physics, national accelerator laboratory, Stanford linear
      accelerator, controlled fusion, turbulence, nonlinear optics, lasers and
      masers, atomic and molecular beams, biophysical acoustics, very large
      radio array, and x-ray and gamma ray astronomy.
         Committee concurred with recommendation of Astronomy Survey
      Committee [see June 11 that High Energy Astronomy Observatory
       (HEAO) should be prominent in national effort in astrophysics and
      astronomy. â€œBecause of the opaqueness of the earthâ€˜s atmosphere to
      both X and gamma radiation, these windows on the universe have only
      recently been opened through rocket and satellite astronomy. Any

August 13-28: Explorer 46 Meteoroid Technology Satellite (MTS) was
   launched by NASA from Wallops Station by four-stage Scout booster
    at 1 1 : l O am EDT. Spacecraft and booster, which included new Algol I11
    1st stage, weighed 21 650 kg (23.9 tons) -heaviest vehicle ever launched
    from Wallops. Orbital parameters : 814.5-km (506.1-mi) apogee,
    495.8-km (308.1-mi) perigee, 98-min period, and 37.7â€ inclination.
       Primary objective was to evaluate effectiveness of bumper-protected
    multisheet spacecraft structure for protection against meteoroid pene-
    tration in first inflight test. Data would be compared with data from
    single-sheet structures launched previously. Secondary objectives were
    to obtain data on meteoroid impact velocity and measure impact flux
    of small mass meteoroids.
       Satellite had been designed, fabricated, and tested by Langley
    Research Center. It carried three experiments : bumper penetration
    experiment with 12 panels, each 48 cm wide and 3 m long (19 in x
    lOV2 ft), containing 8 pressurized cells; impact flux experiment con-
    taining 65 thin-film capacitance penetration sensors arranged in groups
    of 3 and 5 on various parts of spacecraft; and meteoroid-velocity
    experiment consisting of 2 plates of sensors and timer to measure time
    meteoroid traveled distance between plates.
       By Aug. 22 spacecraft experiments and telemetry systems were
    operating and good data were being obtained, but half of panels in
    bumper experiment apparently had not deployed. Spacecraft was
    spinning at 3 rpm as planned, but because of panel deployment
    anomaly and resulting spin axis 90â€ to that planned, spacecraft
    battery temperature had risen from 299 K (79Â°F) past 308 K (95Â°F)
    design temperature to 337 K (147Â°F) Aug. 22. Battery was still
    providing voltage and all experiments were functioning satisfactorily.
    During spacecraftâ€™s second pass Aug. 22, telemeter A, powered by
    battery, came on as commanded but telemeter B, backup system
    operated by solar-cell power, went off unexpectedly. Officials decided
    to discontinue interrogation of telemeter A so that data from telemeter
    B would not be jeopardized. As a result, no data were being received
    from secondary experiments and no housekeeping data were received.
    About 2000 impacts by submicrometer particles had been detected
    during telemeter A operation, providing sufficient data for impact
    experiment. No data had been obtained from meteoroid-velocity
    experiment. By Aug. 28, 3 of 48 pressurized detector cells successfully
    deployed had been punctured and primary experiment was continuing
    to provide good data. (NASA proj off)

        do something about the high cost of doing business in space, and
     do it soon, our nationâ€™s space program is in deep trouble. We are on
     the verge of exciting new discoveries in space science, but we cannot
     follow through as rapidly as we should because we canâ€™t afford it.
     We see before us many important space applications, but we cannot
     move out as rapidly as we should because we canâ€™t afford it. Most
     important of all, we may lose our hard-won worldwide leadership in
     space, if we donâ€™t find a way to do more for our money!â€ NASA
     could do little about budgetary restraints, â€œbut there is a great deal
     we can do about costs. Doing something about the high cost of doing
     business in space is todayâ€™s biggest challenge.â€
         In past, NASA had been forced to develop expensive equipment for
     one-time use. â€œToday we have 52 operating civilian spacecraft. By
     the end of next year we will launch 35 more, for a total of 87â€
     representing â€œ43 different spacecraft types---on the average each space-
     craft [type] is flown only twice!â€ But payloads had become more
     complex, while launch costs decreased. â€œWe are no longer as limited
     in weight and volume as we were ten years ago; with the shuttle,
      weight and volume constraints will be non-existent for many missions.
      This means that we should now optimize our payloads for low cost and
      high reliability, and not for minimum weight and maximum perform-
           ..   . I am convinced that if we do this, we can drastically reduce
      ance.

  NASA announced that Pioneer 7 flight directors had located and revived
     Pioneer 7 after one month of radio silence. Spacecraft was on far
     side of sun, more than 312 million km (194 million mi) away-so far
     away that round trip time for radio communication to spacecraft and
     back to earth was 35 min at speed of light. Controllers had reacquired
     Pioneer 7 â€œin the blindâ€™â€™ without knowing spacecraftâ€™s exact position
     or radio receiverâ€™s exact frequency and had set long-distance record
     for finding and reviving spacecraft that had turned itself off. Scientists
     had theorized that at Pioneer 7â€™s farthest distance from sun electrical
     power from spacecraftâ€™s solar cells had fallen below level required to
     operate spacecraft and scientific instruments. By leaving instruments
     off temporarily and thus reducing power requirements, turn-on of

    perigee, 100.6-min period, and 90.1O inclination. Objective of mission
    was to simplify navigation procedures by correcting long-term drift in
    satellite oscillator, reducing data-gathering time for navigation fix,
    demonstrating capability of experimental disturbance compensation
    system (DISCOS) , obtaining performance data on radioisotope thermo-
    electric generator (RTG) , evaluating environmental survey panel and

September 9: Tass reported results of Venus 8 probe that had landed
    capsule on Venus July 22 after four-month flight. Wind had moved
    descending capsule horizontally in same direction as planetâ€™s rotation
    on its axis. Wind speed had declined from 48 m (160 ft) per sec at
    45-km (28-mi) altitude to 2 m (6 ft) per sec at 11 km (7 mi). Key
     question during landing was whether sunlight reached Venusian surface
     or was absorbed completely by atmosphere and clouds. Preliminary
    data on changes in illumination at different altitudes showed that
    Venusian atmosphere considerably weakened sunlight but some sun-
     light did reach surface. Atmosphere consisted of 97% carbon dioxide,
     less than 2% nitrogen, and less than 0.1% oxygen and contained
     O.Ol-O.l% ammonia at altitudes between 33 and 46 km (20 and 30
     mi). Surface in landing area resembled earth granite rock in radio-
     active composition with 4.0% potassium, 0.0002% uranium, and
     0.00065% thorium. (FBIS-SOV,9/13/72, L7)

September 11: NASA released prints from infrared photos of New York
     area taken by Erts 1 (launched July 23). Black-and-white photo of
    New York City taken from 915-km (569-mi) altitude covering area
     185 km (113 mi) square was covered by clouds, but was valuable
     as a general test of Erts 1 instrumentation. Images of infrared radiation
     from which prints had been made clearly showed distribution of
     vegetation in New Jersey.
        Dr. Paul D. Lowman of Goddard Space Flight Center said in inter-
     view that pictures of other areas had been of higher quality. â€œOur
     first discovery from ERTS is that all our maps, topographic as well as
     geologic, are out of date.â€ In Californiaâ€™s Monterey Bay area, scientists
     had discovered â€œa whole series of unsuspected faultsâ€ in earthâ€™s crust.
     While major earthquake faults ran northwest and southeast, newly
     discovered faults ran at right angles to mountains, northeast and
     southeast. About 15 faults, each extending about 16 km (10 mi), had
     been discovered in Monterey region and about 12 faults had been
     discovered near Lake Tahoe, Calif. Satellite picture of Dallas-Fort
     Worth area showed many new roads, reservoirs, suburbs, and airports
     that were not on areaâ€™s most recent map, made three years before.

     greatly to ensure success of future earth orbital and planetary satellites.
     â€œRemotely manned systems are man-machine system that augment
     and extend manâ€™s sensory, manipulative and intellectual capabilities
     to remote places. However while machines may have superior strength
     and endurance and reGstance to hostile environments, they still depend
     on human intelligence for decision-making in the performance of
     complicated tasks. Advanced engineering automation is essential in
     space station and shuttle operations and scientific data gathering must
     be microminiaturized for sustained interplanetary operations of two
     or more years.â€ (JPL Releases 625, 626; Swain, Pasadena Star-News,

    that received testimony from NASA management and Apollo 15 astro-
     nauts on commercialization of postal covers and replicas of â€œFallen
     Astronautâ€ sculpture that was carried to moon during mission. Hearing
     had revealed â€œno basic new factsâ€ on incidents. NASA had disciplined
     astronauts for carrying unauthorized covers. There was â€œno indication
     at this time that the Apollo 15 crew either profited or intended to profit
     fromâ€ sales of sculpture. Sale of sculpture by artist Paul Van

     diminished under SALT, unless the United States undertakes and main-
     tains a military research and development program that is compre-
     hensive, consistent, and competitive.â€ If US. emphasized efforts on

       Air Force System Commandâ€™s Newsreview traced historical high-
    lights of its bases and organizations. Arnold Engineering Development
    Center (AEDC) near Tullahoma, Tenn., had been established in 1953
     at recommendation of aeronautical scientist Dr. Theodore von Kirmin.
    Center currently consisted of 41) test units that provided â€œsimulated
    flight-test capability ranging in speed to more than 20 times the speed
    of sound and to altitudes around 1,000 miles [1600 kilometers].â€
    Centerâ€™s replacement value was $840 million. Patrick Air Force Base,
    Fla., had grown with space program. Launch of V-2 from Eastern
    Test Range at Patrick in 1950 â€œwas the first step to the moon. That
    goal,,now accomplished five times, leaves the future of space explora-
    tion on the threshold of a dream.â€

    versary. â€œIt would be very easy . . to take off on rhetorical flights of
     overcoming the unlimited challenges of aerospace. The challenges do
    exist; and they could conceivably mean that the future of the Air
     Force will include the use of remotely piloted vehicles, hypersonic air-
     craft, and the laser. But if these, and anything else man can envision
     and produce, do exist in the future, they will only be the means for
    Air Force people to do their basic job of providing this country with
    the aerospace power required for defense and security. As in the past

September 22-25: NASA launched Explorer 47 (IMP-H) Tnterplanetary
    Monitoring Platform from Eastern Test Range at 9:20 pm EDT by
    three-stage, long-tank, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta booster. Satellite
    entered transfer orbit with 237 796-km (147 759.6-mi) apogee, 246-km
     (152.9-mi) perigee, 7365-min (5.11-day) period, and 28.6â€™ inclination.
    Primary objective was to provide more detailed understanding of
    dynamics of regions discovered and broadly surveyed by previous
    earth-orbiting IMPS and lunar IMP by obtaining scientific data during
    period of decreasing solar activity. Explorer 47 would continue studies
    of interplanetary radiation, solar wind and energetic particle emissions,
    and magnetic fieIds in earthâ€™s environment from orbit halfway to moon.
       Apogee kick motor was fired Sept. 25 to place Explorer 47 in

     (125 267.8-mi) perigee, 12.3-day period, and 17.2â€™ inclination. By
    Sept. 25, 10 experiments had been commanded on and were operating
    satisfactorily. Three remaining experiments would be turned on about
    Oct. 5.
       Explorer 47 was drum shaped, weighed 378 kg (833 Ibs), and
    carried 13 experiments to measure energetic particles, plasmas, and
    magnetic and electric fields. Experiments were provided universities,

      Ray Crater had been formed relatively recently or tens of millions of
      years of solar heat had not affected characteristic resonance. Either
      way, experiment had revealed that resonance of North Ray Crater soils
      probably contained fossil record of thermal and weathering histories

September 28-30: Symposium on High Energy Phenomena on the Sun
     was held at Goddard Space Flight Center to present recent findings
     to scientists from US., Australia, U.K., France, and Japan. Detection
     of first direct evidence of nuclear reactions on solar surface, during
     Aug. 4 and 7 by NASAâ€™s 7 Orbiting Solar Observatory (launched
                               Oso
     Sept. 29, 1971), was reported by Univ. of New Hampshire physicist
     Dr. Edward L. Chupp and team. Evidence had been obtained from
     two gamma-ray emission lines-radiation indicators of nuclear proc-
     esses-during first observation of these radiations from sun. Findings
     proved that nuclear reactions did occur in large solar flares, and might
     contribute to goal of generating pollution-free electrical power from
     sustained thermonuclear reactions in laboratory. (NASA Release 72-193)

* Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, spoke at dedication ceremony
     for Univ. of Kansas Space Technology Center and at joint University
     and Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Lawrence, Kan., cerebrating
     dedication. At dedication he said ceremony marked final step in NASA-
     sponsored program to build space-oriented research facilities at U S .
     universities under Sustaining University Program started in 1960s.
     Univ. of Kansas Center was 37th and last facility to be completed.
     Dr. Fletcher said program had accomplished its mission â€œextremely
     well. These splendid facilities give our Nation the means of performing
     research that would be virtually impossible without them.â€ Programâ€™s
     projects had been â€œinvaluable in the successful accomplishment of
     many of our greatest achievements in space.â€ NASA had found in
     universities â€œa concentrated source of one of the irreplaceable ingre-
     dients of advanced research programs-highly trained intellects. And
     now that they can work in facilities to match, we are expecting even
     more productive results.â€
        Dr. Fletcher discussed universitiesâ€™ role in NASA activities in luncheon
     speech: â€œWe work with large and small universities in aeronautics and
                                                 .

     and . . . compatible with university interests and capabilities. We
     encourage the use of NASA laboratory facilities and the exchange of
     information between university faculty and NASA scientists.â€ More
     than 900 university experimenters had used space data, more than
     300 investigators from 42 universities had analyzed lunar samples,
     25 universities had conceived Apollo mission experiments, and 2500

* Laser fusion approach to thermonuclear power was discussed in Science
     article. Most US. fusion research for past 20 yrs had been directed
     toward containing fusion reaction with magnetic forces, but many
     scientists now thought fusion could first be achieved with high-powered
     lasers. â€œBy bypassing the need for a magnetic field, the laser approach
     has also bypassed a long and depressing catalog of plasma instabilities
     that have thwarted the enthusiastic early hopes of physicists for proof
     of feasibility. But more than one major breakthrough per year in
     later development may be necessary before scientists can make hydrogen
     in a reactor hotter and denser than the sun.â€ (Metz, Science, 9/29/72,

    Observatory (launched by NASA Aug. 21) , Explorer 42 (Uhuru) Small
    Astronomy Satellite (launched by Italy for NASA Dec. 12, 1970) , and
    Dept. of Defense Vela satellite. Observations and speculations as to
    meanings were so extensive, Walter S. Sullivan said in New Yurk
    Times article, that British journal Nature Physical Science devoted
    entire Oct. 23 issue to subject. Explosions were radio emissions from
    gas cloud expanding at about half the speed of light, Sullivan said,
    but were â€œclearly not those of a supernova, since they were observed
    only at radio wave lengths and they recurred several times.â€ If, as
    some astronomers suspected, explosion source was also source of
    x-rays being emitted in 288-min cycle, object exploding probably was
    spinning once every 288 min and was â€œabout the size of a star.â€

    American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics President, said in
    Astronautics & Aeronautics editorial. US.-U.S.S.R. space agreement
    (6
       expresses our intention to cooperate in various fields of space activity,
    and in particular proposes a joint experimental flight of US. and
    Soviet manned spacecraft in 1975. We may debate the immediate
    technical values of this experiment, but the overriding consideration
    is the fact that we will be working together. Regardless of the tech-
    nological outcome we will be communicating and collaborating, getting
    to know each other better, in a common enterprise. On such small
    beginnings, a new era of mutual understanding and cooperation might
    evolve.â€ (A&A, 9/72, 19)
* Engine concepts for space applications were described in Air University
    Review. Government and industxy had spent more than $100 milIion
    on high-pressure-engine technology since 1961. Air Force XLR-129
    engine program had provided strong technical base for space shuttle
    engine. Shuttleâ€™s orbiter stage would use advanced-concept staged
    combustion engine â€œvery similar to that of a turbojet equipped with
                       ...
    an afterburner;          there are two different stages of combustion.â€
    While first turbojet combustion occurred in main chamber, shuttle
    engineâ€™s first burning occurred in gas generator or preburner. Preferred
    engine concept for future spacecraft would be â€œsingle engine that
    could operate as a rocket, a ramjet, a scramjet, and a turbofan.â€
    At liftoff, rocket would be firing and â€œturbofan might also be operating
    to supply additional air to improve the performance of the rocket.
    After the vehicle is moving at a greater speed, the ramjet would start
    operating, and the turbofan would be removed from the airstream. The
    pure rocket would continue to operate briefly to aid the ramjet. As the
    vehicle reaches the outer fringes of the atmosphere, the inlets would
    be closed, and the pure rocket would be used alone for reaching,
    maneuvering in, and leaving orbit. To return to base after re-entry
    into the atmosphere, the ramjet and/or the turbofan might be used
    separately or they might be used like an afterburning turbofan.â€
    To improve spacecraft performance further, â€œwe would like to get
    away from having to carry an oxidizer for the rocket portion of the
    flight.â€

         Future space engines would â€˜Lmatethe tremendous energy available
      from nuclear explosions with the ability of a rocket to operate at high
      thrust levels.â€ Performance of nuclear rocket â€œmore than makes up
      for its being heavier than a normal rocket.â€ Nuclear rocketâ€™s specific
      impulse was about twice that of â€œeven the best chemical rocket.â€
      Nuclear stage also would be useful for seeding space with unmanned
      applications satellites. (Holder, Siuru, Air Univ Rev, 9/72)
    Europeâ€™s dilemma over altered conditions for participation in post-Apollo
0

      space program was described by Kenneth W. Gatland in Spaceflight.
      E>uropehad been invited to develop research and applications module
       (RAM) for space shuttle, rather than space tug as originally discussed.
      Elimination from Europe of any shuttle propulsion technology had
      â€œleft little room for manoeuvre.â€ Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm would
      be â€œdenied the opportunity to contribute their Attitude Control Pro-
      pulsion System (ACPS) engineâ€ which â€œis considered to be fully com-
      petitive with US. equivalentsâ€ because NASA had rejected ACPS as
      â€œtoo advanced and too complexâ€ a European contribution. Space tug-
      with attributes of both launch vehicle and spacecraft-would have
      pushed propulsion technique â€œwell beyond what is currently envisaged
      in Europe.â€ Tug covered â€œvery extensive range of the basic techniques
      of interest to the Europeans and might engender solutions to the most
      classic problems.â€ Tugâ€™s â€œfar-reaching integration with the shuttle and
      with the payload during operations would have afforded Europe effec-
      tive participation in most American missions, i.e., the majority of
      space activities in the 1980s.â€ (SF, 9/72, 322-3)

Ohober 1 : Joint US.-U.S.S.R. space mission scheduled for 1975 would
    include 48-hr linkup of Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft and crew exchange,
    Soviet Cosmonaut Vladimir A. Shatalov said in report released by
    Tass. Coyuz spacecraft, manned by two cosmonauts, would be launched
    first. â€œIn seven and a half hours, Apollo spaceship manned by three
    astronauts will be launched from Cape Kennedy. In 24 hours, Apollo
    will approach the Soyuz ship and link up will be made. The system
    that will be formed will be operated as a single spacecraft. Within
    two days, spacemen will move from one ship to another, scientific and
    technical experiments will be made and there will be television trans-
    missions to the earth. At the end of the third day, the spaceships will
    be undocked and will soon land on their respective territories.â€ Shatalov

9 Significance of NASA and Soviet Academy of Sciences joint Apollo-Soyuz

    test project (ASTP) was discussed by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA
    Administrator, in letter to NASA staff. Eyes of world would be on
    NASA and Soviet manned space flight teams as never before. There
    cc
      must be a near certainty that the mission will be successful, or it
    should not be attempted.â€ Not just NASA reputation but â€œfuture of
    manned space flight and international cooperation in space will be
    significantly influenced by the success or failure.â€ Mission also was
    <<
       important first step to facilitate rescue missions in space and to
    enable manned spacecraft from two or more countries to participate
    in future cooperative activities. And because several years of friendly
    cooperation are required just to plan and fly this one test mission,
    it takes on an added symbolic significance and gives us the feeling
    that even now, long before the flight, we may be making a contribution
    to the cause of peace and better understanding between our two
    countries.â€ Decision to cooperate in project was â€œoptimistic vote of
    confidence in the future of manned space flight by the two leading
    powers.â€ But project had practical limits. Neither side would transfer
     its technology as such. â€œSo neither side has to give away anything, but
    each has much to gain.â€ Biggest concession to be made by each country
    was â€œrecognition that close and visible cooperation between the two
    countries on an important aspect of manned space flight has become
    desirable.â€ (NASA Activities, 10/15/72, 200-2)

 NASA released official summary of reasons for selection of North American
   Rockwell Corp. for S2.6-billion prime contract to build space shuttle.
   Summary said NR had been chosen over competitors-Grumman Aero-
   space Corp.; Lockheed Missiles & Space Co., Inc., Space Systems Div.;
   and McDonnell Douglas Gorp.-because          â€œNorth American Rockwell
   attained the highest score from a mission suitability standpoint, be-
   cause its cost proposal was lowest and credible, and because its ap-
   proaches to program performance gave high confidence to us, to the
    [Source Evaluation] Board, and to the Manned Space Flight center
   directors, that it will indeed produce the Shuttle at the lowest cost.â€
   Summary-signed Sept. 18 by Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administra-
   tor-said NRâ€™s â€œgreatest advantagesâ€ within mission suitability area
   were in management, with efficient controi of program and best overall
   top project management team. NR design provided lightest dry weight.
   NRâ€˜s â€œgood understanding of all electrical power subsystems reflected
                              .
   the very thorough studies . . made following the Apollo 13 accident.â€
   Analysis of maintainability was excellent. Further, NR management
   techniques â€œshould provide earlier identification of cost problemsâ€ and
   planned constrained buildup of resources in beginning of program lent
   confidence in ability to control costs.
      Grumman Corp. had been â€œvery close behindâ€ but its plan to build
   up its work force to early manpower peak had been seen by NASA as
   threat of â€œpremature commitment of resources during the course of the
   program.â€ Grummanâ€™s greatest strength had been in its technical de-
   sign; McDonnell Douglas design had strong features but some technical
   drawbacks ; and Lockheedâ€™s proposal had lacked â€œconsistent technical
   depth.â€ NASA had originally made summary available only to General
   Accounting Office and to competing bidders because of potential em-
   barrassment to losers. Agency had later released summary, Wall Street
   Journal said, â€œto demonstrate that politics didnâ€™t play any role in the
   decision and that the most painstaking selection procedures in the
   agencyâ€™s history were observed.â€ (Text; WSJ, 10/5/72,12)

ASTRONAUTICS AND AERONAUTICS, 1972                             October 9-15


    of LTV Aerospace Corp., presented by Green. Since inception of pro-
    gram in 1959, Scout vehicle had successfully launched 67 payloads.
    Studies had been made to ensure that system would provide flexibility
    for â€œunique missions to supplement the space shuttle.â€ (Pamphlet
    reprint of Text)
       Dale D. Myers, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space
    Flight, said European Launcher Development Organization (ELDO)
    studies of space tug had been discontinued but NASA studies were
    continuing. â€œOur present belief is that the required technical advances
    combined with the budgetary demands that the space shuttle will
    make . . . will make it impossible to develop within this decade the
    â€˜full capabilityâ€™ that we feel will eventually be necessary.â€ NASA was
    investigating alternate approaches â€œto providing a Space Shuttle third
    stage which will give us a reduced but acceptable capability for the
    delivery of payloads during the early years of shuttle operation.â€
    Alternatives being considered were : to modify existing stage for use
    as expendable third stage; to make major modifications to existing
    cryogenic- or storable-propellant stage to enable it to carry payload
    to geosynchronous orbit and return to shuttle orbit for reuse; or to
    build new vehicle with less capability than needed, as part of evolu-
    tionary program leading to vehicle with required capability. Studies
    of first alternative were under way; contracted studies within next
    year were expected to examine latter two alternatives. (Text)
       Sixth International History of Astronautics Symposium, held Oct. 13,
    was chaired by Dr. Eugene M. Emme, NASA Historian. In introduction
    Dr. Emme pointed out that 57 men had flown in space since October
    1957, 10 had walked on lunar surface, 22 had flown around moon,
    and 2 (Astronauts James A. Lovell, Jr., and John W. Young) had
    traveled to moon twice and made two earth-orbiting flights. Papers
    presented included â€œHungarian Rocketry in the 19th Centuryâ€ by
    Istviin 6. Nagy, â€œOrigins of Astronautics in Switzerlandâ€ by A. Waldis
    of Swiss Transport Museum, and â€œDevelopment of the Technology of

October 9-79: US. and U.S.S.R. representatives met in MOSCOW             on
    Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) , joint rendezvous and docking mis-
    sion scheduled for 1975. Meetings agreed on July 15, 1975, target
    launch date for Soyuz, with five launch opportunities for Apollo
    beginning 7% hrs after Soviet launch-an         addition of two oppor-

    tunities. Atmospheric pressures of cabins would be adjusted while
    spacecraft were docked, to avoid necessity of prebreathing pure oxygen
    before transfer of crewmen from Soyuz to Apollo cabins. Soyuz
    pressure would be lowered from its normal 101 kilonewtons per sq m
    to 69 (from 14.7 psi to 10); Apollo pressure would remain at 35
    kilonewtons per sq m (5 psi).
       First joint crew training session was scheduled for summer of 1973,
    with cosmonauts visiting US. for several weeks. Astronauts would
    train equal time in U.S.S.R. in fall of 1973. Soviet two-fifths scale
    model of docking mechanism would be tested with US. model during
    Moscow meeting in December 1972. Further consideration of extra-
    vehicular crew transfer would be deleted; if any emergency prevented
    return of crewmen to their own ships, they would land in spacecraft
    they were visiting. Sufficient propellant would be budgeted for Apolla
    spacecraft to allow it to maintain attitude control while docked.
       Exchange of working groups would be more frequent, with meetings
    at MSC in November, in Moscow in December, and at MSC in March
    1973.
       US. delegation included representatives of prime contractor North
    American Rockwell Corp. and three of five working groups established
    in July 6-18 meetings at MSC to define mission elements. Working
    group members included Astronaut Thomas P. Staff ord. NASA delega-
    tion was headed by ASTP Director Glynn S. Lunney. Senior member
    of Soviet delegation was Prof. Konstantin D. Bushuyev, U.S.S.R.'s
    ASTP Director. (NASA Releases 72-198, 72-207, 72-211; AP, C Trib,

October 10-12: Flat Conductor Symposium was held at Marshall Space
    Flight Center to exchange information on flat conductor cables and
    promote their wider use in commerce and industry and building trades.
    Cables were thin, parallel, metal conductors, embedded in plastics or
    other insulating materials. New fabricating methods had produced
    cable for conducting electricity that was ribbon-thin and backed with
    adhesives which adhered to wall surfaces. Cables required little space
    and were easily folded to conform to unusual shapes or patterns.

    deep roots or were deposits on uniform subsurface. Surface electrical
    properties experiment would measure physical properties of lunar
    interior to l-km (0.6-mi) depth. Experiment, connected to LRV naviga-
    tional system by cable, also would indicate subsurface electrical and
    mechanical properties, extent of subsurface layering, and degree of
    energy scattering at landing site, and possible existence of under-
    ground water. First direct LRV linking with experiment would enable
    scientists on earth to correlate its specific location with experiment
    data. (NASA Special Release)
0 Apollo 17 crew had selected mission emblem to emphasize beginning of

    golden age of space flight that final Apollo flight would usher in
    Dec. 6, NASA announced. Emblem showed Apollo gazing toward planet
    Saturn and a galaxy, symbolizing that manâ€™s goal in space would
    someday include planets and even stars. Suspended behind Apollo
    image was American eagle with four red bars on wing, representing
    US. flag. Three white stars represented Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan,
    Ronald E. Evans, and Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt. Eagleâ€™s wing over-
    lying moon suggested moon had been conquered by man. (NASA

October 13: Three Nike-Apache sounding rockets launched by NASA from
    Poker Flat near Fairbanks, Alaska, carried GCA Corp. experiment to
    study thermospheric winds using vapor-trail technique. Experiment
    data would be compared and contrasted with data from several different
    ground-based and airborne measuring systems. Data were acquired by
    high-speed cameras aboard NASAâ€™s Convair 990 optical aircraft and by
    ground-based instruments-incoherent scatter radar, radio meteor winds
    system, ionosonde, interferometer, spectrographs, and high-speed
    cameras. Vapor trails for two launches were produced by sodium-
    lithium ejected from payload. Rockets performed satisfactorily and
    good data were obtained. Launches carried no instrumentation. Vapor
    trails for third launch were to have been produced by liquid tri-
    methylaluminum ejected from payload in flight. Launch was adjudged
    failure when Apache 2nd stage failed to ignite. Payload did not reach
    experiment altitude of 80 to 200 km (50 to 125 mi) and no data were
    obtained. (NASA Rpt SRL; Wallops Release 72-10)

flew the Bell X-1 experimental jet aircraft (at top above), launched from a B-29
bomber from Muroc Flight Test Base, to the speed of 1078 kilometers (670 miles) per
hour to break the sound barrier in level flight. The X-1 had been developed under
an Army Air Force contract with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics coopera-
tion. I n 1972, research plans included hypersonic flight, with flights in 1973 of the
X-24B lifting body in a NASA-USAF program to develop technology for future aircraft
that could cruise at hypersonic speeds at the edge o f space. T h e X-24B was delivered
to the USAF and NASA by Martin Marietta Corp. in Littleton, Calif., ceremonies Oct. 11
and unloaded at Flight Research Center Oct. 22 (lower photo). The B version o f the
X-24A, flown in 1971, had an extended nose, flattened underside, and blended wings.

        Primary objectives were to place 345-kg (76043) spacecraft in sun-
     synchronous orbit with local equator-crossing time between 9 :00 and
     9 :20 am and conduct in-orbit engineering evaluation, before turning
     operational control of spacecraft over to NOMâ€™S National Environment
     Satellite Service (NESS). Orbit would permit regular, dependable day-

October 17: Ariel 4, cooperative United Kingdom and US. satellite
     (launched by NASA Dec. 11, 1971), was adjudged successful. During
    more than 10 mos in orbit, spacecraft had operated satisfactorily
    except for tape recorder failures and minor experiment problems.
    Primary mission objective-to        investigate interaction of electro-
    magnetic waves, plasmas, and energetic particles in upper ionosphere-
    had been achieved.

   and development. Pattern would include increasingly effective pro-
   gram in civilian sector R&D, â€œprudent space program, and a sufficient
   defense R&D budget.â€ Administration believed R&D funding should be
   based on opportunities for effective programs and necessity for creat-
   ing new opportunities through fundamental studies and that R&D
   resources, excepting basic research, should be allocated to areas that
   provided â€œgreatest opportunity for leverage or that satisfy an immedi-
   ate future need.â€
      Sen. McGovern recommended increased Federal R&D funding.
   Principal problem was â€œgovernment spending that has masqueraded
   as R&D, yet has little technical content. For example, when an Apollo is
             ..  . all of the kerosene and liquid oxygen that it uses comes
   launched
   out of the federal R&D budget. Only a very small percentage of the
   federal R&D budget actually represents laboratory investigations, instru-
   ment design, feasibility studies, and other technical efforts that involve
   scientists and engineers.â€ Sen. McGovern would emphasize civilian
   sector R&D and strong military R&D program as â€œgood investment for
   long-term national security. My space program would emphasize un-

   resource and communications satellites.â€ Nixon Administration would
   continue to maintain â€œstrong and up-to-date defense forceâ€ and to
   capitalize upon past space investments. Both candidates recommended
   increased priority on developments of new energy sources.
      Nixon Administration was opposed to S. 32, reconversion bill intro-
   duced by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to amend National Science Founda-
   tion Act of 1950 to establish framework of national science policy.
   Bill would focus policy and US. scientific talent and resources on
   Nationâ€™s priority problems. Administration believed segment of S. 32
   that would establish independent agency within NSF was â€œparticularly
   unwiseâ€ because it would â€œdivorce the R&D from the departments of
   Government responsible for using its resultsâ€ and â€œwould divert atten-
   tion from the primary mission of NSF-to support fundamental and
   basic research.â€ Sen. McGovern would continue to support S. 32. â€œIn
   its original form, before compromise to get Republican support, it
   would have provided $1.2 billion for a new NASA-type civil Science
   Systems Administration that would fund genuine R&D across a broad
   range of civilian technology needs.â€
      Administration did not believe in Cabinet-level science department
   or â€œsupraâ€ agency, nor that â€œexisting science apparatus is totally
    adequate. As with all human and governmental institutions, it too
   should be dynamic and subject to change as conditions and events
   dictate.,â€™ Sen. McGovern felt â€œmore centralized federal science manage-
   ment and funding apparatus might be useful, but the key need is not
   to change the institutions but rather to give them more power in the
    Federal Government.â€ He favored establishment of Office of Tech-
    nology Assessment [see October 131 which would â€œassess each new
   technical program with an eye toward cost efficiency and effectiveness,
    and domestic betterment.â€ Asked if federally owned laboratories should
   be expanded to deal with problems of health and environment, Nixon
    Administration pointed out that NASA Centers were â€œclosely involved
    with the R&D components of other federal agencies in an effort to
    solve pressing national problems.â€ Sen. McGovern believed Federal

October 23-27: Conference on high-energy astrophysics was held at Cal
    Tech by division of American Astronomical Society. Dr. Kenneth I.
    Kellerman of National Radio Astronomy Observatory said most baffling
    phenomenon observed by radiotelescopes was speed at which objects
    seemed to be moving. If measurements taken in past two years were
    accepted at face value, objects associated with quasars were speeding
    away from each other faster than speed of light. Such speed had been
    considered impossible. Gal Tech astronomer Dr. W. L. W. Sargent
    said strange blue objects sighted in sky by Hale Observatory astrono-
    mers might be newly formed galaxies â€œabout 100 million years old,
    and they seem to be made up of very young stars.â€ Discovery indi-
    cated that galaxies might still be forming. Dr. Herbert Gursky of
    American Science and Engineering, Inc., said astronomers using Uhuru
     (Explorer 42 Small Astronomy Satellite launched by NASA Dec. 12,
    1970) had spotted several x-ray objects that could not be detected by
    wavelengths other than x-ray. Impact of x-ray astronomy might be
    that â€œthis new wavelength range may show some different aspects of
    stars and galaxies.â€ Through x-ray astronomy scientists â€œhope to . . .
    learn something about these objects that radio and optical observations
    canâ€™t tell us.â€
        Evidence of black hole-star whose gravity field was so strong that
    light could not escape from it-in constellation Cygnus was reported
    by Dr. Kip Thorne of Cal Tech, Dr. J. P. Ostriker of Princeton Univ.,
     and Dr. Riccardo Giacconi of American Science and Engineering.
     Evidence had come from photos taken at Hale Observatory that showed
    bright blue line near source Cygnus X-1 and from data gathered by
     Uhuru (see also Sept. 2 ) . Scientists thought line in photos might be
     result of superhot gas being drawn from neighboring star in black hole.
     If finding was accurate, Cygnus X-1 would be first black hole dis-
     covered. Existence of black holes had been predicted by Einstein as
     part of his theory of relativity. (Cooke, Pasadena Star-News, 10/24/72;

    this â€œtwo-history rockâ€ had â€™crystallized 3.93 billion yrs ago but had
     retained some crystals that had been formed between 4.40 and 4.48
    billion yrs ago. First crystallization probably had been associated
     with great heat during moonâ€™s formation but scientists had no clue to
    cause of second melting period and subsequent recrystallization. Dr.
     Paul W. Gast, Chief of MSC Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., said
     Cb
       fundamental conclusionâ€ was evolving from new understanding of
     moon gained â€œlargely out of the Apollo program.â€ Scientists â€œhave to
     now look at each individual planet and somehow or another infer its
     chemical composition.â€ They were beginning to see chemically hetero-
     geneous solar system.
        Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt, Apollo 17 lunar module pilot, described
     Apollo 17 landing site in moonâ€™s Taurus-Littrow area on rim of
     Serenitatis Basin : â€œItâ€™s in that general geographic ring that resembles
     the Apennine front near where Apollo 15 landed. It has, however,

     the Mare Serenitatis. We are landing on a plain that seems to overlie
     a slightly elevated flat surface that predates the mare. And it seems
     when you look at all of the basins on the moon, that that surface,
     a correlative surface in other basins, is somehow related to the forma-
     tion of the basin. There are comparable plains around all of the big
     circular basins, and there is a flat floor that predates the mare that is

       Dark cover over valley floor and portions of highlands was younger
    than mare and was as little as 0.5 m (1.6 ft) thick. Radar data had
    shown cover was â€œfinely fragmented mantle materialâ€ that was
    â€œubiquitous in all of the low areas and locally is covering portions of
    the highlands.â€ Dr. Schmitt said mantle, although of not as high a
    priority as the crustal examination in the south massif, had â€œpotential
    of giving us our most fundamental evidence for studying this evolu-
    tionary model.â€ Potential was high that â€œdark mantle material has
    sampled some significant portion of the crust. At least it has sampled
    its source area, and that source area is very probably deep within the
    moon.â€ Dr. Schmitt told press that to be able to say that man was
    â€œon the verge, if not already there, of understanding the evolution of
    another planet is something that is really unprecedented in the history
    of man. And I think thatâ€™s the thing thatâ€™s the news of Apollo. That is
    what we have done.â€ (Transcript)
  Mariner 9 mission ended as attitude-control gas supply was depleted and
    engineering telemetry signal ceased during 698th Martian orbit of
    spacecraft launched May 30, 1971. Mariner 9 had reached Mars
    Nov. 13, 1971, and was 383 675 000 km (238 416 000 mi) from earth
    when engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent 45 960th, and last,
    command-to turn off radio transmitter. Spacecraft was expected to
    remain in Mars orbit some 50 yrs.
       During 349 days (more than one half Martian year) of orbital
    activity, Mariner 9 had maintained instrumented surveillance of Mars
    and made first closeup photos of Martian moons Phobos and Deimos.
    Major findings had included: geologically active planet with volcanic
    mountains and calderas larger than any on earth, equatorial crevasses
    more than 3000 km (2000 mi) long and three to four times deeper than
    Grand Canyon, indications that free-flowing water might have existed
    in Marsâ€™ geologic history, evolution of monumental dust storms that
    raged to altitudes of 50 to 60 km (31 to 37 mi) above Mars surface,
    and realization that dust storms and cloudiness accounted for much
    of variability of Marsâ€™ appearance over years.
       Mariner 9 was first man-made object to orbit another planet. Mariner
    project, managed for NASAâ€™s   O5ce of Space Science by JPL, had been
    planned as two-spacecraft mission to Mars but Mariner 8, launched
    May 8, 1971, failed to enter orbit when Centaur stage of Atlas-Centaur
    booster malfunctioned after normal countdown and liftoff from Eastern
    Test Range. Spacecraft had reentered earthâ€˜s atmosphere. Plans had
    been revised and Mariner 9 had been launched successfully to conduct
    missions of both Mariners. Data from Mariner 9 experiments would
    provide groundwork for 1975 Viking lander mission to search for
    evidence of life on Mars. ( J P L Release 634; A&A 1971)

  Overview of Apollo 17 mission, scheduled for Dec. 6 launch, was given
    by Mission Director Chester M. Lee at NASA-Hq. press briefing. Mission
    experiments would include lunar surface gravimeter to detect possible
    lunar surface deformaticn from pull of earth and sun and to confirm
    existence of gravity waves; lunar ejecta and meteorite experiment to
    determine mass, velocity, and frequency of meteorite impacts on moon
    and nature of their ejecta; lunar seismic profiling experiment to acquire
    data on lunar near-surface structure and layering; lunar atmospheric
    composition experiment ( MASSPEC) ; experiment to measure solar flares ;
    and lunar traverse gravimeter with receiver carried on lunar roving
    vehicle Rover to survey anomalies of gravity at all science stops.
       Among major new experiments on Apollo 17 mission would be
    surface electrical properties experiment to determine lunar surface
    layering and measure electrical properties of material; lunar neutron
    probe to measure capture rate of low-energy cosmic ray secondary
    neutrons and neutron energy spectrum as function of depth; and
                                                                             .

      Astronauts would remain on moon for record 75 hrs, would make
      three traverses in Taurus-Littrow valley during three 7-hr extravehicular
      activity periods, and would drive electrified, four-wheeled Rover record
      33.8 km (21 mi), including one drive that would take them almost
      8 km (5 mi) from lunar module. Astronaut Ronald E. Evans would
      remain in lunar orbit in command module. Cernan and Schmitt were
      to rejoin C M at 5:56 pm EST Dec. 16. Splashdown was scheduled for

      Erts 1 Earth Resources Technology Satellite (launched July 23) in
      speech before First International Conference on Computer Satellites
      in Agriculture at Ohio State Univ. Satellite â€œnow circles the earth
       14 times a day in near-polar orbit. Each pass covers a region 185 lun
       (115 miles) wide. After 18 days, the satellite returns to the same
      position. The ERTS Multispectral Scanner scans the earth in four wave-
      length bands.â€ Green band enhanced features within water, since they
      were transparent in band. Red band showed contrast between vegeta-
      tion and man-made structures and was good for land use mapping.
      Infrared band was invisible to human eye but â€œvegetation strongly
      reflects this energy, and thus appears bright on film. Water absorbs
      it, and appears dark. This band is often used to identify plants or
      crops, since the brightness of the image depends greatly on the type
      of vegetation. It is also used to determine the health of plants, because
      healthy crops will appear to be much brighter than those which are
      diseased.â€ Data to date had shown earth resources satellites like
      Erts 1 would be able to take large-scale inventories of crop type
      and crop health. ERTS data â€œlend themselves to rapid automated
       area calculation procedures for all kinds of agricultural production

     and to make them available to the scientific communityâ€ through
     Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Manned Spacecraft Center ; that Apollo
    lunar surface experiment package (ALSEP) network and subsatellite be
     operated continuously as long as they provided significant new find-
     ings; that selected raw photographic observations be processed to
     obtain usable scientific product; that lunar science program be con-
     tinued at â€œsubstantialâ€ level; that advisory panels be continued and
     augmented to emphasize geophysical and photographic data analysis ;
     and that â€œsmall, selective program of mission planning be maintainedâ€
     concurrently with instrument definition program â€œto provide the desired
     continuity between the present and the future.â€ LSI also recommended
     high priority for high-inclination orbital mission to determine geo-
     physical, geochemical, and geological variables on planetwide scale,

* Results of U.S.S.R. research of Mars as released by Soviet press were
    summarized by Znteravia. Initial analysis of data collected by Mars 2
    and 3 (launched May 19 and May 28, 1971) spacecraft during inter-
    planetary flight had indicated large variations in composition of
    interplanetary plasma ions at 20 million km (12.5 million mi) from
    earth. Data had also revealed new information on distribution of solar
    plasma around solar system and its relationship with interplanetary
    and terrestrial magnetic fields. No magnetic field had been detected
    near Mars, indicating possible lack of liquid core.
       Orbits of spacecraft had been selected to cover areas of Martian
    surface difficult to investigate from earth-central latitudes of southern
    hemisphere to 65â€ south, equatorial zone, and northern hemisphere
    to 29â€™ north. During Martian orbit infrared radiometer data had
    shown certain areas of surface to be definitely warmer than immediate
    surroundings, indicating possible volcanic activity.
       Mars 2 and 3 had found steam content in Martian atmosphere to
    be 2000 times less than that existing in terrestrial atmosphere. At times
    precipitated water could be 50 micrometers; at others, less than 10.
    Since photos taken by NASAâ€™s Mariner 9 revealed impressive valleys
    which could have been formed by erosion, Soviet scientists had
    theorized that higher temperatures and pressures, sufficient to produce
    water in liquid form, existed on Mars in previous era. Very sharp
    differences in planetâ€™s brightness, never before observed from earth,
    were observed by visible range photometer. Data were collected from
    measurement of radio-wave reflection.
       After landing, scientific results from Mars 2 and 3 had been meager.
    Mars 2 had hardlanded a capsule on Mars Nov. 27, 1971. Photos and
    measurements by Mars 3 (which softlanded a capsule Dec. 2, 1971)
    had indicated a dust cloud 6 to 8 km (4to 5 mi) thick covering land-
    ing area, leading to speculation that either dust storms had raged
    over area and caused capsule to land incorrectly or capsule had
    sunk into dust layer.
       Soviet Academician Anatoly A. Blagonravov had said U.S.S.R.
    planned to use 1973 launch windows if program of Martian exploration
    continued as planned. (Znteravia, 10/72,113941; GSFC SSR, 1/31/73)

    experiment aboard Dept. of Defense Space Test Program satellite
    Sesp 1971-2 (launched by Air Force Oct. 17, 1971) had shown Aug.
    2-7 solar flare had produced more intense bombardment of earth by
    plasma showers than any previously watched by satellites. Data would
    aid Navy scientists in understanding effects of solar storms on polar
    radio communications and auroral and polar cap phenomena. ( ONR

* Panel of Geophysics Research Board of National Research Council
    released Summary Report of the Ad Hoc Panel on (NO,) and the
    Ozone Layer. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had
    asked Panel to review paper by Univ. of California at Berkeley physicist
    Dr. Harold S. Johnston [see Aug. 11 and to consider research to
    resolve uncertainties that existed in Dr. Johnstonâ€™s hypothesis that
    nitrogen oxides from exhausts of supersonic transport aircraft could
    have destructive effects on ozone concentration. Uncertainties existed
    because dynamic processes might distort chemical equilibrium model
    based on static atmosphere, rates of some reactions in scheme of
    chemical kinetics might not be known, and estimations of SST engine
    exhaust products seemed uncertain to order of magnitude, at least.
    Panel had concluded: â€œThere appears to be general agreement that
                                       .
    Harold Johnstonâ€™s conclusions . . are credible, but with the reserva-
    tions cited.â€ Possibility of serious effects on the normal ozone could
    not be dismissed. â€œTo the extent that existing information permits,
    Johnston has done a very careful and detailed analysis.â€ It was evident

    center of civilization-man himself, his intellect and his capacity to
    learn and act, and thereby retain in some great measure control over
    his own destiny.â€ Goal of space program was to â€œplace the tools of
    planetary management into the hands of man.â€ Rather than barrier or
    constraint, space had become to man â€œa natural extension of his
    sphere of activity. I do not see this as ephemeral or temporary; I
    believe that, both physically and intellectually, our operating environ-
    ment has been permanently expanded. This is a real contribution to
    the human spirit.â€ Human spirit was difficult to define; â€œit is measured
    by attitudes and aspirations and mature expectations. Our space experi-
    ence, in the fourteen years past, has given us all a different-and
    better-view of the future. In a very real sense, the future is already
    here; we must learn to recognize it and live in it responsibly.â€ (Text)

* Boosted Arcas I launched by NASA from Churchill Research Range
     carried Univ. of Houston payload to 57-km (35.4-mi) altitude. Primary
     objective was to supplement comprehensive investigation of auroral
     zone disturbances conducted by Black Brant carrying Univ. of Texas
     payload and launched 60 sec later. Secondary objective was to study
     auroral phenomena in region above altitude already investigated, using
     balloons, and below altitude investigated, using rockets. Rocket and
     instrumentation performed nominally although one of two telemetry
     receivers provided marginal response. Recovery could not be effected
     because winds blew payload over Hudson Bay.
         NASA Black Brant, launched from Churchill Research Range 60 sec
     after Boosted Arcas, reached 240-km { 149.1-mi) altitude. Primary
     objective of Univ. of Texas payload was to provide complete data on
     auroral precipitation events, analyze particle spectrum over wide
     energy range and observe spectrum in and above aurora, and observe
     optical emissions and ionospheric parameters. Rocket performed
     nominally but only one of nine experiments was successful because of
     faulty nosecone ejection mechanism. Nosecone did not deploy until
     descent portion of trajectory. Payload was recovered. (NASA Rpt sRL;

November 6: NASA selection of five potential landing sites on Mars for
    two unmanned Viking spacecraft in summer 1976 was announced by
    Dr. S. Ichtiaque Rasool, Deputy Director of Planetary Programs, in
    telephone interview. NASA also released Mariner 9 photos of sites-
    two at edge of Nix Olympica slopes, another near slopes of three
    smaller volcanoes north of canyons along Martian equator, fourth on
    desert plain, and fifth in region of ffattened craters at edge of highland
    terrain. Observations from Mariner 9 (launched May 30, 1971) had
    shown sites were low, relatively warm regions, possibly moist, where
    life form was most likely to be discovered. Prime objective of Viking
    missions was to determine if Mars harbored life or potential for life.
    In choosing sites, project scientists had eliminated nearly one third
    of Mars because of high elevations. In mountainous regions, Viking
    parachutes would not have sufficient atmosphere to brake spacecraft
    descent. Scientists also had rejected areas where surface appeared too
    soft for spacecraft landing, too hard for retrieval of soil samples, or so
    steep that spacecraft might tip over on landing. Attention had centered

November 6: Selection of five potential landing sites on Mars for WASAâ€™S two un-
manned Viking spacecraft in 1976 was announced. The map showing the sites was
based on photos televised from Manner 9, launched May 30, 1971, and in orbit around
Mars since Nov. 13, 1972. All the sites were fairly smooth areas near scientifically
interesting geological features and were in regions of the planet where warmer tem-
peratures and greater likelihood of water increased chances of finding evidence of life.
The first map of the entire globe of Mars, prepared by the US. Geological Survey
from 1500 of 7000 photos taken by Mariner 9, was published Nov. 27.

November 9-1 5: Canadian Domestic Communications Satellite (Tele-
    sat-A) -named Anik I, Eskimo for brother-was launched successfully
    at 8:14 pm EST by NASA from Eastern Test Range on three-stage, long-
    tank, thrust-augmented Thor-Delta launch vehicle. Anik 1 was placed in
    highly elliptical transfer orbit with apogee of 36 470 km (22 661.4 mi) ;
    perigee, 188.9 km (117.4 mi) ; inclination, 26.9â€™. After checkout and
    reorientation of spacecraft, apogee kick motor on board Anik 1 was
    fired at 3:55 pm EST Nov. 13, bringing spacecraft into near syn-
    chronous circular orbit with 36 508-km (22 658-mi) apogee, 35 822-km
     (22 258.8-mi) perigee, 1455-min period, and 0.4â€ inclination and
    drifting to final operating position in synchronous equatorial orbit off
    west coast of South America.
       Under contract between NASA and Telesat Canada, NASA mission
    objective was to place Anik I in orbit of sufficient accuracy to allow
    onboard propulsion systems to place spacecraft in stationary syn-
    chronous orbit while retaining sufficient station-keeping propulsion to
    meet mission lifetime requirements. Objective was met; mission was
    adjudged successful Nov. 15.
       Launch was first on Thor-Delta â€œstraight eightâ€ launch vehicle, so
    called because diameter was eight feet for all three stages including
    fairing. Previous Thor-Deltas had been tapered at joint of first and
    second stage. New design allowed Delta to launch new generation of
    larger volume spacecraft. Flight was also first with nine solid-fuel
    thrust-augmentation rockets from Cape Kennedy. Third stage was
    TG3644 solid-fueled motor.
       Anik 1-first of two-was         built by Hughes Aircraft Co. under
    contract with Telesat and designed to provide transmission of TV,
    voice, and data throughout Canada for seven years. It would provide
    10 color TV channels or up to 9600 telephone circuits. System could
    distribute analog or digital signals with overall performance com-
    parable to that of terrestrial methods. Spacecraft, 1.8 m in diameter
    and 3.4 m high (6 by 1 f t ) , weighed 540 kg (1200 Ibs) at launch
                                1
    and 270 kg (600 lbs) in orbit. Electronics system was powered by
    23 000 solar cells, with onboard battery capacity to maintain service
    during sun eclipse.
       Telesat Canada would reimburse NASA for cost of launch vehicle
    and services. Goddard Space Flight Center managed project for NASA

    Impact of large meteorite on moonâ€™s far side had provided first evidence
a
      suggesting moon still had molten core, Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal
      investigator for Apollo seismic experiments, said in press interview at
      Univ. of Texas. Data were preliminary and fragmentary but â€œI hope
      weâ€™ll be able to confirm or reject this core hypothesis in a month or
      so.â€ Impact had been recorded July 17 by all four seismometers left
      on moon by Apollo astronauts but had not been discovered until
      recently because of delays in examining telemetry reports from instru-
      ments. Meteoriteâ€™s size had not yet been determined but it â€œprobably
      was larger than the â€˜whopperâ€™ recorded in May.â€ Meteorite which
      impacted moon May 13 had been largest since seismometers began
      functioning in 1969. Seismic signals from July 17 impact had had
      â€œfunny focusing effect that could be explained by a core.â€ (Rossiter,

November 16-27: Explorer 48 (SAS-B) Small Astronomy Satellite, second
    in series of three, was successfully launched for NASA by Italian crew
    at 1:14 am local time (5:14 pm Nov. 15 EST) from San Marco
    Facility off coast of Kenya. Four-stage solid-propellant Scout launch
    vehicle boosted 186-kg (410-lb) payload into circular orbit with
    632.5-km (393-mi) apogee, 443.7-km (275.7-mi) perigee, 95.4-min
    period, and 1.9" inclination. Launch was 26th consecutive successful
    Scout launch, record for NASA vehicle.
       Primary objective of Explorer 48 was to measure spatial and energy
    distribution of primary galactic and extragalactic gamma radiation-
    within SAS program to make investigations of celestial sphere from
    above earth's atmosphere and search for sources inside and outside
    our galaxy, radiating in x-ray, gamma ray, ultraviolet, infrared, and
    other regions of electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma ray telescope was
    first satellite version of evolution of digitized spark-chamber telescopes
    that had begun with balloon-borne instruments. Advanced detector
    could establish gamma ray event and reject events that simpler instru-
    ments might identify erroneously. It could study gamma rays exceed-
    ing 20 mev in energy, in region of electromagnetic spectrum able to
    penetrate galactic and extragalactic matter.
       On Nov. 19 half of experiment's high-voltage supplies were turned
    on and experiment was pointed toward earth. Real-time data acquisi-
    tion indicated proper functioning of experiment, with detection of
    earth albedo gamma rays. Remaining high-voltage power was turned
    on Nov. 27. Experiment and spacecraft control section were function-
    ing normally.
       Spacecraft was cylinder 59 cm in diameter and 51 cm high (23-in
    dia by 20). When deployed, four solar paddles-27 cm wide and 135
    cm long (10.5 by 53 in)-provided raw power. Unique was separate
    development of spacecraft control section and experiment package,
    which had permitted flexible concurrent development of experiments
    and minimized costs by fabrication of standardized control section.
       NASA provided booster and satellite; Italian team was responsible
    for cost-reimbursable launch preparation. Goddard Space Flight Center
    and Applied Physics Laboratory crew performed ground test and
    checkout. Satellite was designed and built at GSFC, which managed
    project. Langley Research Center managed Scout. (NASA proj off; NASA

November 18: NASA and Boston Univ. Dept. of Astronomy sponsored
     symposium â€œLife Beyond Earth and the Human Mindâ€ at Boston Univ.
     Panel Chairman Richard Berendzen, Boston Univ. astronomer, had
     said symposium was being held because recent findings in astronomy,
     biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics had indicated high prob-
     ability of existence of extraterrestrial life. Many scientists believed
     that â€œwithin the next few decades some form of communication will
     be achieved with intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe.â€ Panelists
     were anthropologist Dr. Ashley Montagu, Massachusetts Institute of
     Technology physicist Dr. Philip Morrison, Cornel1 Univ. astronomer
     Dr. Carl E. Sagan, Dean Krister Stendahl of Harvard Divinity School,
     and Dr. George Wald of Harvard Univ., winner of 1967 Nobel Prize
     for medicine and researcher in biochemical evolution.
        Dr. Sagan said human technology had reached stage where man
     could detect another civilization as advanced as his. â€œMost optimistic
     estimate of civilizations in our galaxy is one million, which means one
     per many hundred thousand stars.â€ Searching stars one by one could

    life are probably more intelligent than we, which can explain why
    they havenâ€™t contacted us.â€ Dean Stendahl said discovery of life else-
    where would teach man that Godâ€™s domain is larger and would give
    man better idea of his place in it. Contacting other beings might help
    man to stop viewing God in his own image. Dr. Wald said he was
    convinced that life existed elsewhere in galaxy but he doubted man
    would ever contact it. Dr. Morrison predicted man would receive and
    verify message from another civilization. Message would be technical,
    scientifically coded communication received over many months or

November 24: Twenty-fifth anniversary of first launch of Aerobee sound-
    ing rocket on Nov. 24, 1947, from White Sands Missile Range. Launch
    had been unsuccessful; rocket carrying Johns Hopkins Univ. payload
    had veered off course and had been destroyed. But since then arrow-
    shaped Aerobee had been busiest booster in U S . space program, with
    launch rate of almost one per week and few failures out of 900 launches
    to date. Aerobees carrying scientific payloads to altitudes as high as
    480 km (300 mi) had been launched by NASA, Air Force, Navy, and
    Federal scientific groups. Launches were mainly from NASAâ€™s      Wallops
    Station, White Sands Missile Range, and Fort Churchill Range in
    Manitoba, Canada.
       Aerobe-most      widely used rocket in astronomy-had carried deli-
    cate instruments through blanket of air and dirt surrounding earth to
    area of greater visibility. Instruments launched June 13, 1969, by NASA
    on Aerobee 150 from Natal, Brazil, had detected x-ray star only 16 km
     (10 mi) wide that weighed as much as sun. Scientists at Univ. of Cali-
    fornia who conducted experiment had said stellar object might be first
    direct evidence of neutron star and first time size of x-ray source from
    deep space could be determined.
       Other scientific payloads aboard Aerobees had measured Crab Neb-
    ula, collected micrometeoroids, taken temperatures aloft, and recorded
    air densities. In 1952 Air Force Aerobee carried two monkeys and two
    mice in biomedical experiments.
       Rocket originally weighed 700 kg (1600 lbs), was 5.8 m (19 ft)

    long, and carried payloads under 45 kg (100 lbs) Over years Aerobee
    had grown to be 15 m (50 ft) long, powered by four clustered, liquid-
    fuel engines and solid-fuel booster. Largest Aerobee could blast 400-kg
     (900-lb) payload to altitude of 200 km (125 mi). (Lyons, NYT,

0 Dr. Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., Manned Spacecraft Center Director and

    former MSC Director of Flight Operations, reviewed Apollo program in
    Associated Press interview published in Baltimore Sun. Apollo 8
     (launched Dec. 21, 1968) had been programâ€™s pivotal mission. â€œIt
    proved so many things that had a bearing on the progress of the pro-
    gram-things that it might have disproved. The navigation to and from
    the moon, the ability of the spacecraft systems to perform, the ability
    of man to survive the deep space environment, all hinged on the Apollo
    8 mission.â€ Mission also had changed competitive position of U.S. and
    U.S.S.R. in space. â€œI really believed the Russians planned to fly a cir-
    cumlunar mission, sending a manned spacecraft looping around and
    returning it without orbiting the moon. That way they could say they
    sent the first man to the vicinity of the moon. And when we . . . decided
    to fly Apollo 8 as a moon-orbit mission, there was nothing left for them
    to do.â€ There was no major technological field that â€œhasnâ€™t been mate-
    rially changed or had some reflection of not only Apollo but of the
    whole space program.â€ Space technology had been important to main-
    tenance of US. position as leading nation in world. Five manned lunar
    landing flights had produced greater scientific return than envisioned.
    â€œWe have done just about all we should have done with the Apollo pro-
    gram in terms of lunar exploration. This is a good time to stop, eval-
    uate what we have and use our resources to do other things in the space
    program.â€ (B Sun,11/24/72, A10)

    Governmentâ€™s Plowshare program to release trapped oil and gas by
    nuclear explosions, delayed Alaska pipeline, and forced near-mora-
    torium on dam building. Ecologists had â€œforced power companies to
    abandon scenic river and lake sites in 10 states and have caused more
    than 20 delays in the construction of nuclear power plants.â€ Disagree-
    ment was â€œrampantâ€ over changes wrought by environmental move-

    age 68. He had taken office five days after U.S.S.R. launched Sputnik 1
    (Oct. 4,1957), in midst of controversy between branches of U.S. armed
    services over responsibility for missile and satellite programs. McElroy,
    former executive of Procter & Gamble Co., ordered no cuts to be made
    in $1-billion budget that had been approved by Congress for basic re-
    search. Research led to successful launchings in 1958 of Navy and Army
    satellites that helped U.S. to recover some prestige in space field. Mc-

      using adiabatic toroidal compressor (ATC) at AECâ€™s Princeton Plasma
      Physics Laboratory had achieved, for first time, plasma density in
      range in which tokamak fusion reactor was expected to operate and
      had demonstrated new technique for heating tokamak plasma to
      thermonuclear temperatures. ATC was device for containing and heating
      plasma fuel to temperatures that would melt any other container. It
      was improved version of Soviet-developed tokamak containing and
      heating device that had been hailed internationally as promising
      approach to production of fusion power. Soviet results from T-3
      tokamak experiment, published in 1969, had been confirmed by
      Princeton tokamak experiments in 1970. Dr. James R. Schlesinger,
      AEC Chairman, had said new ATC results â€œfurther brighten the prospect
      of realizing commercial fusion power in a tokamak confinement sys-
      tem.â€ But AEC had â€œmany years of hard work aheadâ€ to develop
      concept into â€œpractical power system.â€ (AEC Release P 4 0 4 ; AEC PIO)

    exploration in â€œbroad sweep of history and in the evolution of man
    and manâ€™s perception of himself and his universe.â€ British historian
    Arnold J. Toynbee and American anthropologist Dr. Margaret Mead

    picture of earth taken from the moon is one of the most powerful
    images in the minds of men today and may be worth the cost of the
    whole Apollo project.â€ He saw photo as â€œa great landmark in explora-
    tion-to get away from the earth to see it whole.â€ Soviet poet Robert
    Rozhdestvensky had said: â€œMan has become . . . more perceptive to
                                                                        ..
    what worries other people. He has no possibility of hiding away .
    of escaping reality and shutting himself up in the narrow world of
    his own.â€ French anthropologist Dr. Claude Levi-Strauss had said:
    â€˜â€˜I never look at TV except when thereâ€™s a moon shot, and then I am
    glued to my set.â€ Dr. Garrett Hardin, ecologist of Univ. of California
    at Santa Barbara, had said it was time to pull back from further
    manned space exploration for several centuries. Space program â€œcan
    only be called â€˜spiritualâ€™ in both the good and bad senses.â€

8 Astronautsâ€™ image was discussed in New York Times Magazine article.

    Of 73 pilots and scientists selected for astronauts corps only 39
    remained active, and corps faced future cuts. Three astronauts had
    died in Jan. 27, 1967, Apollo spacecraft fire; five others in aircraft
    and auto accidents. Of 25 who had left corps, â€œmany have followed
    the conventional paths of glory into business and Government.â€ But
    â€œin the behavior of others there is more than a touch of the eccentric,
    and a large dose of trouble, almost a mythological element: the
    wandering hero back among his tribe, after stealing the sacred fire and
    grappling with terrifying demons, condemned to ask tough questions.â€
    World might regard some astronauts as â€œByrds and Lindberghs of our
    time.â€ As space program emphasis shifted, â€œthey may be an endangered
    species. For the hotshot pilot seems destined to be replaced in the
    space stations of the near-future with scientists given training of shorter
    duration for their flight duties.â€ Astronauts had been â€œwandering
    heroes who tried to unite us with their vision of earth as a small ball
     floating in an oceanic universe, with all men as passengers. But they
    werenâ€™t really poets, and they flew at a time of bitter earthly quarrels,
     with many resentful of the price tag on their odyssey.â€ Like most
    heroes, â€œthey were magnified versions of all of us, men of great daring
     and courage whose competitiveness was no doubt fierce, whose outlook
     was often corporate and even corny, whose ingenuousness was at times
     profound. But their image as a comforting symbol to Middle America
     did them an injustice.â€ (Muson, NYT Magazine, 12/3/72, 37, 142)

       Baltimore Sun on post-ApolIo space program: â€œWhile it is tempting
    to contemplate what improvements could be financed here on earth
    from the billions being spent in space, it is well to bear several factors
    in mind. One is the decline in space spending from a $5.25 billion
    peak in 1965 to the present plateau of $3.35 billion a year. Another
    is the Nixon administrationâ€™s decision to proceed cautiously on the
    rush-rush manned Mars expedition advocated by Vice President Agnew
    three years ago. Still another is the American-Soviet agreement on a
    rendezvous-and-dockingmission for mid-1975, a concept once relegated
    to political science fiction. Finally, there is the very real prospect that
    experiments and programs conducted from space shuttles will be of
    use in improving the environment on earth. More accurate weather
    forecasting, air pollution studies, better communications-these are
    some of the more obvious opportunities. These trends surely justify
    reasonable financial support to continue a desired momentum in space
    technology.â€ (B Sun, 12/3/72)

  Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, described major alterations
    in â€œnature of the space effortâ€ to be expected with 1978 introduction
    of space shuttle, in signed New York Times article. National space
    program had â€œturned an important corner in 1972-a year that, in a
    very real sense, was a year of decisionâ€ in choosing to proceed with
    shuttle. US. had â€œturned from a period of space exploration to a
    period of space exploitation for practical purposes.â€
       By 1978 it would be â€˜â€˜realistic to consider a variety of missions
    either not practicable at present cost levels or that were beyond the
    state of the art as it was in the pre-shuttle era.â€ Missions would include
    advanced, space-based communications systems that, when used for
    education, would â€œhave the potential for eliminating illiteracy from
    the face of the earth.â€ Shuttle-launched advanced-version Nimbus
    satellites, combined with weather-modeling ground computers, would
    permit experiments in weather modification to dampen violent storms.
    Earth resources program data would provide precise picture of crop
    and timber conditions and extent of attacks by disease, drought, and
    fire. By 1980s, pilot space manufacturing operations might be in
    progress. â€œSuper pure vaccine could thus be produced. Perfectly
    homogeneous alloys, fiber composites and perfectly round ball bearings
    are other possibilities.â€ During 1980s, â€˜â€˜program of planetary explora-
    tion should record the completion of a close look at all the planets in
    our solar system as well as a detailed study of Mars, Jupiter and Venus.
    Large orbiting telescopes will be aimed at the outer reaches of the
    universe, examining such phenomena as quasars and pulsars.â€ (NYT,
     12/4/72, 50)
* Term â€œpost-Apolloâ€ had â€œoutlived its usefulness,â€ Dr. James C. Fletcher,
    NASA Administrator, said in message to staff. â€œWhen plans for this
    decade were still uncertain it made sense to refer to them as post-Apollo
    plans. But today we are advanced with new programs which stand
    on their own merits.â€ Skylab, space shuttle, Viking, High Energy
    Astronomy Observatory ( HEAO) , and Pioneer and Mariner missions
    to planets drew heavily on technology of 1960s, â€œbut they take this
    technology giant steps into the future.â€ Dr. Fletcher suggested names
    for future years: 1973 would be â€œYear of Skylabâ€ and of Pioneer 10,
     1975 would be year of Apollo-Soyuz rendezvous, in 1976 Viking would
    land on Mars, and in 1978 first space shuttle orbital flight was
    scheduled. â€œEach of these events will make a memorable page in the
     story of human progress. Each of them will contribute importantly to
     mankindâ€˜s knowledge of our planetary environment.â€ (NASA Activities,

December 7-19: Apollo 17 (As-512) , sixth and last successful NASA
    manned lunar landing mission, carried three-man crew-including
    first scientist-astronaut in space-to moon's Taurus-Littrow region after
    first nighttime launch. Lunar module Challenger (LM-12) landed on
    moon Dec. 1 and two astronauts deployed experiments, rode lunar
                    1
    roving vehicle (LRV), and explored lunar surface during 75-hr stay.
    Challenger rejoined orbiting command and service module America
    (CSM-114) in lunar orbit Dec. 14 for safe return to earth with record
    115 kg (250 lbs) of lunar samples Dec. 19.
       December 7-10: Launch from Kennedy Space Center Launch Com-
    plex 39, Pad A, by Saturn V launch vehicle was delayed 2 hrs 40 min.
    Automatic cutoff at T minus 30 sec in countdown required recycle and
    hold at T minus 22 min; additional hold was called at T minus 8 min.
    Holds were caused when terminal countdown sequencer failed to
    command pressurization of S-IVB liquid-oxygen tank. Tank was
    pressurized manually, but failure to arm tank's pressurized interlock
    prevented continuation of launch events until interlock was bypassed
    by jumper. Workaround was first thoroughly analyzed at Marshall
    Space Flight Center. Investigation later indicated cause of failure was
    defective diode on printed circuit card in sequencer.
       Spacecraft-carrying Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan (commander),
    Ronald E. Evans (command module pilot), and Dr. Harrison H.
    Schmitt (lunar module pilot and geologist)-was launched at 12:33
    am EST Dec. 7, with illumination from S-IC 1st stage creating brilliance
    of morning sun. Liftoff, witnessed by crowd estimated at 500000 and
    by nationwide and foreign TV viewers, was visible to naked eye as far
    as South Carolina to north and Cuba to south.
       Spacecraft and S-IVB combination entered parking orbit with 170-km
     (105.6-mi) apogee and 168-km ( 104.4-mi) perigee. Following checkout,
    spacecraft was inserted into trajectory for moon at 3:13 ground
    elapsed time (GET) as planned. CSM separation from LM/S-IVB/IU
    at 3:42 GET and docking with LM at 3:57 GET were shown on TV.
    During docking possible ring latch malfunction was indicated. Trouble-
    shooting reveared latches 7, 9, and 10 were unlocked. Latch 10 was
    locked by pushing on handle; latches 7 and 9 were locked and manually
    fired to lock handles. Following hatch replacement, CSM/LM com-
    bination was ejected from S-IVB stage at 4:45 GET. S-IVB lunar
    impact maneuver targeted stage to strike moon's surface Dec. 10.
       Midcourse correction (MCC-1) was not necessary because of
    nominal trajeciory. MCC-2 maneuver was performed on time at 35:30
    GET, changing velocity 3 m per sec (9.9 fps). Cernan and Schmitt
    entered LM at 40:lO GET and discovered docking latch 4 improperly
    latched. Evans moved latch handle 3Oo45O, disengaging hook from
    docking ring. Mission Control and flight crew decided to wait until
    second LM entering at 59:59 GET for further action on latch. Remainder
    of LM housekeeping was nominal and LM was closed out at 42:11 GET.
       Heat flow and convection demonstrations were conducted as planned;
    results were satisfactory. MCC-3 and -4 were not required because of
    near-nominal trajectory. LM housekeeping was resumed at 5 9 5 9 GET
    and completed at 62:16 GET with all systems nominal. Evans, following
    ground instructions, stroked docking latch 4 handle and succeeded in
    cocking latch. Latch was left in cocked position for CSM-LM rendezvous.

    and Challenger touched down on Taurus-Littrow site at 113:02 GET
     (2:55 pm EST Dec. 11).
        Cernan descended LM ladder four hours later, at 117:02 GET, and
    said: â€œAs I step off at the surface at Taurus-Littrow, Iâ€™d like to dedicate
    the first step of Apollo 17 to all those who made it possible.â€ Schmitt,
    first geologist to walk on moon, followed and asked, â€œHey, whoâ€™s been
    tracking up my lunar surface?â€ Cernan said surrounding hills looked
    like â€œwrinkled skin of an old, old, 100-year-old man.â€
        Astronauts deployed lunar roving vehicle. Cernan made short test
    drive and said, â€œHallelujah, Houston! Challengerâ€™s baby is on the roll.â€
         As Cernan and Schmitt set up TV equipment, Cernan called to
    Schmitt: â€œHey, Jack, just stop. You owe yourself 30 seconds to look
    up over the South Massif and look at the Earth.â€ Schmitt replied:

    unfurled US. flag on lunar surface while Schmitt took his picture.
    Cernan said, â€œItâ€™s got to be one of the most proud moments of my
    life.â€ Flag had â€œflown in the MOCR [Mission Operations Control Room]
    since Apollo 11. And we very proudly deploy it on the Moon, to stay
    for as long as it can, in honor of all those people who have worked so
    hard to put us here and to put every other crew here and to make the
    country, the United States and mankind, something different than
    it was.â€
         While preparing to traverse to Apollo lunar surface experiment
    package site, Cernan inadvertently knocked extension off of LRV right
    rear fender and repairs were made with tape. Astronauts crossed to
    ALSEP site, where they deployed ALSEP. Color TV camera beamed live
    telecast to earth.
         LRV fender again fell off during traverse to Steno Crater, lunar
    station 1A. Crew deployed surface electrical properties experiment and
    explosive packages during 7-hr 12-min lunar surface exploration. First
    EVA ended at 124:13 GET.
         Second EVA began 1 hr 20 min late, at 140:35 GET (6:28 pm EST
    Dec. 12). Cernan and Schmitt, on instructions from Mission Control,
    improvised replacement for lost LRV fender extension. Four chronopaque
    maps were taped together and held in place by two portable utility
    lamp clamps. â€œCall me the little old fender maker,â€ Cernan said.
         Cernan and Schmitt visited lunar stations 2, 2A, 3, 4, and 5. They
     deployed explosive packages, obtained photos, and collected and docu-
    mented soil samples. At station 4, Shorty Crater, Schmitt shouted:
     â€œThere is orange soil! Itâ€™s all over! Orange!â€ Cernan confirmed find-
     ing: â€œJack that is really orange. Itâ€™s been oxidized.â€ Schmitt dug

from lunar orbit as it rose over the
moon, after Astronauts Cernan
and Schmitt had returned to the
Apollo 17 command and service
module America from their explora-
tions o f the lunar surface and before
insertion into trajectory for home.
The lunar module Challengerâ€™s

astronauts from the surface to dock
with the CSM in orbit, had been
separated and nudged into its flight
path for a crash on the moon. The

     Scientists on ground immediately speculated that soil might have
     originated from volcanism on moon as recently as 100 million yrs
     earlier. If so, it would contradict â€œdead moonâ€ theory that moon had
     always been cold and inert. Dr. Robin P. Brett, head of MSC Geo-
     chemistry Branch, told press, â€œWhat we have been witnessing may be
     one of the most significant finds of Apollo geology.â€
       Schmitt revisited ALSEP site to verify that lunar surface gravimeter
     had been leveled properly. EVA-2 ended at 148:35 GET (2:05 am EST
     Dec. 13), after 7 hrs 37 min. Total distance covered during second
     EVA was 19 km (12 mi).
       Third EVA began 50 min late at 163:35 GET (5:26 pm EST Dec. 13).
     Cosmic ray detector was retrieved before start of traverse to prevent
     exposure to low-energy solar protons from small solar flare. Cernan
     and Schmitt took black and white and color photos and collected 66 kg
     (145.9 lbs) of samples. Samples included blue-gray breccias, fine-
     grained vesicular basalts, crushed anorthositic rocks, and soils. EVA-3

    During EVA-3 Evans, orbiting in CSM 113 km (70 mi) above lunar
    surface, identified series of volcanic domes in Aitken Crater, on moonâ€™s
    far side.
       Before entering Challenger for last time, Cernan and Schmitt stepped
    before TV cameras. Cernan said: â€œTo commemorate not just ApolZo
    17â€™s visit to the Valley of Taurus-Littrow but as an everlasting
    commemoration of what the real meaning of Apollo is to the world,
    weâ€™d like to uncover a plaque that has been on the leg of our space-
    craft.â€ He read inscription: â€œHere man completed his first exploration
    of the Moon, December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace in which
    we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind.â€ Dr. James 6. Fletcher,
    NASA Administrator, congratulated astronauts from Mission Control
    at MSC and conveyed Godspeed message from President Nixon. As
    astronauts boarded LM, Cernan said: â€œI believe history will record
    that Americaâ€™s challenge of today has forged manâ€™s destiny of
    tomorrow. And, as we leave the moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave
    as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope
    for all mankind. God speed the crew of Apollo 17.â€
       Total time for three EVAS was 22 hrs 5 min 4 sec, during which
    Cernan and Schmitt traveled 35 km (22 mi) in LRV, collected 115 kg
     (250 Ibs) of samples, and took 2120 photos. Good-quality TV trans-

                  isoned as planned. Impact of stage on lunar surface at
   195:57 GET was recorded by four Apollo 17 geophones and Apollo 12,
   14, 15, and 16 ALSEPS. Explosive packages were detonated and events
   were picked up by lunar seismic profiling geophones. Flash and dust
   from EP 7 explosion were seen on TV.

   to San Diego, Calif.
      ApoUo 17 achieved primary objectives-to make selenological sur-
   vey and sampling of materials and surface features in preselected area
   of Taurus-Littrow region, emplace and activate surface experiments,
   and conduct inflight experiments and photography. Launch vehicle

  Dr. James C. Fletcher, NASA Administrator, assessed Apollo programâ€™s
    meaning to US. in Associated Press interview published by Today:
    â€œScientifically, it has allowed us to start obtaining a clear picture of
    what the moon is like, how it functions, its dynamics, how it has
    evolved and its relationship to the sun and our earth.â€ After all Apollo
    data had been evaluated, â€œit may help us understand how our planet
    evolved from an uninhabited place.â€ Apollo had â€œallowed us to see
    our earth as it really isâ€ and â€œmade a lot of people start talking about
    ecology and the need to preserve this fragile planet.â€ When man first
    walked on moon â€œit gave Americans renewed confidence in them-
     selves. They knew their country could really put together a complex
     program and do what it says it will do within the price it said it
    would cost.â€ (Benedict, AP, Today, 12/7/72)
  Newspaper editorials commented on successful launch of Apollo 17:
        New York Times: â€œIt is still a breathtaking concept, though five
    teams of astronauts have successfully accomplished similar feats since
    Apollo 11 made its historic breakthrough in July 1969. The near-
    catastrophe which forced abortion of the Apollo 13 mission provides
     a useful reminder of the dangers involved despite all the exquisitely
    painstaking care taken before blast-off.â€ Astronauts had â€œspecial

    Leading side of J I11 had 20% more frost cover than trailing side,
    which explained visible geometric albedo differences between the two
    sides. Reflectivity of material underlying frost on J 11, J 111, and J IV
    resembled that of silicates. Surface of J I might be covered by frost
    particles much smaller than those of J I1 and J 111. (Pilcher et d.,

    Sensors aboard Nimbus 5 would map Gulf Stream off east coast of
    U.S. and Humboldt Current off west coast of South America. By
   knowing locations of streams, shipping interests could make substantial
    saving. Nimbus 5 would also provide information about El Nino-
    change in Humboldt Current. El Nino had been causing great economic
    damage by warming coastal waters, killing nutrients and fish.
       Nimbus 2 (launched May 15, 1966, with design life of 6 mos) had
    returned data for 32 mos, for detailed study of effect of water, carbon
    dioxide, and ozone on earthâ€™s heat balance. Vertical temperature
    measurements of Nimbus 3 (launched April 14, 1969) had been
    termed by meteorologists as one of most significant events in meteoro-
    logical history, providing worldwide atmospheric information. Six of
    nine experiments on Nimbus 4 (launched April 8, 1970) could still
    provide atmospheric data.

0 Houston Post editorial described ApoZZo 17 nighttime launch: â€œThe star-

    studded sky exploded so violently and in such huge dimensions that
    it seemed as though a vast reflecting curtain, blended with the night,
    had been hung directly behind the Apollo 17 launch rocket with the
    specific role of casting all that fire and light right back over the
    audience. The climax was reached at the beginning. The drama dwindled
    swiftly to the view of a bright star fading farther and farther away
    as it headed toward the moon. An author could write tomes about
    the space program, but he couldnâ€™t write one line about the nighttime
    launch of an Apollo and get away with it.â€ (H Post, 12/10/72)
December 11: Soviet news agency Tass announced â€œthe perfect executionâ€
    of Apollo 17 lunar landing â€œat 22 hours 55 minutes Moscow time in

9 Space program costs were recounted for press by unidentified NASA
    spokesman at Manned Spacecraft Center. US. had spent more than
    $26.657 billion on manned space program in past 15 yrs and planned
    to spend $8.85 billion in next 5 yrs. Apollo series-most expensive
    program-would cost $25 billion through completion of ApoZZo 17.
    Gemini program had cost $1283.4 million and Mercury, $392.1 million.
    Skylab was expected to cost $2.6 billion, and early estimates for space
    shuttle program were $6.1 billion. NASA had saved $1.5 billion by
    eliminating Apollo 18, 19, and 20. (UPI, NYT, 12/12/72, 38)
0 Historians   would have difficult time explaining decision to abandon
    Apollo program, Time magazine article said. â€œHaving trained the men,
    perfected the techniques and designed the equipment to explore the
    earthâ€™s own satellite, having achieved the ability to learn more
     about manâ€™s place in the universe, Americans lost the will and the
     vision to press on. Barely three years after the first lunar landing,
     the nation that made it all possible has turned its thoughts inward
     and away from space.â€ Though US. spent $5.9 billion to develop
     Apollo rocket system, â€œproduction of Saturn boosters has been halted.
     The painstakingly assembled team of skilled technicians, engineers and
     scientists that made Apollo possible is slowly being disbanded.â€ Those
     who had branded lunar landings propaganda ploys or technological
     stunts were â€œprisoners of limited vision who cannot comprehend, or do
     not care, that Neil Armstrongâ€™s step in the lunar dust will be well
     remembered when most of todayâ€™s burning issues have become mere
     footnotes to history.â€ (Time, 12/11/72, 35)
  US. would continue to use most of Kennedy Space Centerâ€™s $1 billion
     worth of launch facilities despite windup of Apollo program and
     reduced manned space-flight effort, Aviation Week & Space Tech-
     nology reported. KSC Deputy Director Miles Ross had said current
     13 500 contractor and Civil Service employees would grow slightly
     until April 30, 1973, when Skylab would be launched, and taper to
     about 10000 by launch of Apollo-Soyuz mission July 15, 1975. At
     October 1968 peak KSC had employed about 23000 contract workers
     and 3000 civil servants. December roster was 11 000 contract employees

  Aviation Week & Space Technology editorial commented on Apollo pro-
    gram: Six lunar landings had marked â€œhistoric watershed in the
    annals of man.â€ They had been â€œboldest, most imaginative and tech-
    nically complex achievements of manâ€ and had â€œadded a dimension
    to the human spirit that cannot be fully measured for decades.â€ Among
    Apolloâ€™s most important benefits were: (1) â€œDevelopment of new
    technology faster, and on a far broader front than is generally realized.
    The spearhead technology spawned . . . is not just confined to aerospace
    but has spilled over into other broader areas such as medicine, com-
    munications and education.â€ (2) â€œCreation of a cooperative blend of
    engineering and scientific effort that appears to have begun bridging
    a divisive gulf and providing a pattern for more fruitful future work.â€
    Apollo 17 â€œwith its first scientist-astronaut crewmember, foreshadows
    the increasing opportunity for scientists to work in space as Skylab
    and the space shuttle provide suflicient capacity for non-flightcrew
    specialists.â€ (3) â€œCreation of a management capacity in both govern-
    ment and industry for marshaling vast resources to focus on a specific
    goal to achieve results within a limited time. Hopefully, these tech-
    niques can be applied to other complex problems facing modern
     society.â€ (Hotz, Av Wk, 12/11/72, 7)

     such performance as routine, but there is nothing at all routine about
     the assignments of the men and equipment on this far journey.â€
     ApoUo 17 was â€œestablishing even more clearly the high degree of

December 14: President Nixon issued statement following liftoff from
    moon of Apollo 17 lunar module ChaZZenger: â€œAs the Challenger
    leaves the surface of the moon, we are conscious not of what we leave
    behind, but of what lies before us. The dreams that draw humanity
    forward seem always to be redeemed if we believe in them strongly
    enough, and pursue them with diligence and courage. Once we stood
    mystified by the stars; today we reach out to them. We do this not
    only because it is manâ€™s destiny to dream the impossible, to dare the
    impossible, and to do the impossible, but also because in space, as on
    earth, there are new answers and new opportunities for the improvement
    and the enlargement of human existence.
       â€œThis may be the last time this century that men will walk on the
    moon. But space exploration will continue, the benefits of space
    exploration will continue, the search for knowledge through the
    exploration of space will continue, and there will be new dreams to
    pursue based on what we have learned. So let us neither mistake the
    significance nor miss the majesty of what we have witnessed. Few
    events have ever marked so clearly the passage of history from one
    epoch to another. If we understand this about the last flight of

* Science article commented on renaming of Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
    honor of retiring California Congressman: Rep. H. Allen Smithâ€™s
    closest association with aerospace had come in late 1940s when he was
    security manager for Lockheed Aircraft Corp. â€œDuring his years in
    the House, Smith distinguished himself as a quiet, unwavering conser-
    vative dedicated to economy in government.â€ He had voted against
    supersonic transport â€œand on at least three occasions opposed the space
    authorization bill, the ultimate wellspring of JPLâ€™S money.â€ No one
    had asked JPL, California Institute of Technology, or NASA what they
    thought of redesignation. Rep. George P. Miller (D-Calif.) had ap-
    proved but â€œwas not in a position to object gracefully.â€ Rep. Miller,
    too, was retiring and House Committee on Public Works had decided
    to affix his name to Federal building in Oakland, Calif. Article sug-
    gested solution might be â€œfor JPL to acknowledge its new name with
    a small sign behind a fast-growing evergreen and let time take its
    course.â€ (Gillette, Science, 12/15/72, 1178)
December 16-January 22, 1973: West Germanyâ€™s Amos Aeronomy Satel-
    lite was successfully launched by NASA from Western Test Range at
    3:25 PST by four-stage, solid-fuel Scout D vehicle. Spacecraft was
    placed in planned orbit with apogee of 864.4 km (537.1 mi) ; perigee,
     218.1 km (135.5 mi) ; period, 95.47 min; and inclination, 96.95â€.
        Primary objective was to place 127-kg (277-11,) payload in near-
     polar orbit to measure main aeronomic parameters of upper atmos-
     phere and solar ultraviolet radiation in wavelength band of main
     absorption. By Jan. 22, 1973, all five experiments were performing

    satisfactorily and spacecraft housekeeping operations were normal,
    except that problem with synchronization of data rate to spin rate
    might degrade data from NASAâ€™s         neutral atmosphere temperature
    experiment.
        Satelliie, cylinder 71 cm high and 91 cm in diameter (28 by 36 in)
    with four telemetry antennas, would contribute to understanding of
    thermal, chemical, and dynamic processes governing atmospheric
    behavior. Instruments included mass spectrometer, retarding potential
    analyzer, impedance probe, extreme-ultraviolet spectrometer, and
              neutral atmosphere experiment.
    NASAâ€™s
        July 1965 agreement between West Germany and NASA had pro-
    vided for series of cooperative satellite projects. Aeros, second in
    series, was agreed to in Memorandum of Understanding signed June
    10, 1969. NASA was responsible for one experiment, Scout launch
    vehicle, launch, and limited tracking and data acquisition. West Ger-
    man Ministry for Education and Science (BMBW) was responsible
    for development of spacecraft and instrumentation and for operation
    and control of satellite after launch, as well as for four experiments.

December 16: Apollo 17 surface science press briefing was held at
    Manned Spacecraft Center as astronauts headed toward home from
    moon. Stanford Univ. seismologist Dr. Robert L. Kovach described
    results to date from lunar seismic profiling experiment. Experiment
    had recorded impact of lunar module (LM) on lunar surface 9 km
     (5.6 mi) southwest of landing site â€œright on target where we wanted
    it.â€ Kinetic energy at impact was comparable to â€œ1 ton of TNT going
    off.â€ Signal was â€œvery clearly recorded on the geophone array and
                                                          ...
    weâ€™ve acquired an extremely important data point;           weâ€™re effec-
    tively getting a depth sample down to 3 to 4 kilometers [1.9 to 2.5
                               ..
    miles] in the Moon. And . we should get some very important infor-
    mation about the underlying highland type materials.â€ Data point was
                                                                     .
       in critical distance range to answer one of the mysteries . . of the

    shallow Lunar interior. Weâ€™ve been very much concerned about the
                                                                           .
    enormous change in physical properties by terrestrial standards, . .
    velocity changes by enormous percentage over a very small pressure
    range.â€ Data point should provide â€œanswers as to just how these
    properties are changing.â€ First two explosive charges deployed had
    not shown significant differences in subsurface of Apollo 17 landing
    site and those of Apollo 15 and 16 but Apollo 17 site appeared to be
    â€œunderlined by definitely more competent materials and they quite
    probably could be volcanic flows.â€
        Dr. Gary V. Latham, principal investigator for passive seismic ex-
    periment, said Apollo 17 data, when compared with previous data,
    suggested possibility of new interpretation of lunar structure. â€œWe
    do find evidence for lunar crust as we did in the past, but we may
    have to thin it considerabky.â€ Velocity of seismic waves in crustal
    material and velocity of material underlying crust might also have
    to be lowered. â€œWeâ€™re not dealing with pure anorthosite anymore.
                                          ...                 .. .
    Weâ€™re dealing perhaps with gabbros         and so we have      to review
    all of the data and to reconsider our interpretations some, not just the
    seismologist, but the geochemist and geologist, as well.â€

      Dr. Marcus E. Langseth of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory,
   principal investigator for heat flow experiment, said Apollo 17 ex-
   periment had â€œmore than doubledâ€ lunar heat flow data to date. â€œWeâ€™ve
   got a very successful emplacement in the operation of our instrument.
   It has been perfect.â€ Lunar surface temperature recorded Dec. 14 had
   been about 360 K (189Â°F).At about 15 cm (6 in) , it had dropped
   to 280 K (45Â°F).At about 65 cm (26 in) temperature dropped to
   254 K (-2Â°F). â€œBelow that depth, the temperature begins to increase
   again. Itâ€™s about 257 degrees [3â€F]at the bottom of the probes.â€ Data
   indicated that heat flow at Apollo 17 site would resemble that observed
   at 15 cm (6 in). If so, it would â€œgive support to the kind of growing
   model of a warmer interior to the Moonâ€ and â€œwould require that
   there be a total gradient abundance of radioactive isotopes in the Moon
   as compared to Earth. So, there would be implication here for funda-
   mental difference in composition, between the Moon and the Earth.â€
   Dr. Langseth also reported data from traverse gravimeter experiment
   had supported thesis that â€œhigh gravity anomalies associated with the
   mare basin-the so called masconsâ€-probably had been created by
   slab of basalt or lavas which had flooded into previously excavated
   basins.
       Dr. William R. Muehlberger of Univ. of Texas, principal lunar
   geology investigator, said Apollo 17 had provided â€œmost exciting few
   days of my scientific career. This mission is truly the fitting climax
   to the whole Apollo program. The landing site held great promise that
   we were going to get a good chance to unravel much of the earlier lunar
   history as well as the sample and study of what appeared to be very
                        ..
   young vulcanism . . And I think this promise was fulfilled.â€ Orange
   materials at Shorty Crater had been â€œa spectacular plus.â€ Scientists
   hoped â€œreturned material will tell us that that was young vulcanism in
   volcanic alteration of Shorty Crater. Thereâ€™s still a possibility it could
   be an impact crater, however.â€ Dr. Paul W. Gast, Chief of MSC
   Planetary and Earth Sciences Div., discussed Dr. Lathamâ€™s suggestion
   that lunar crust might be thinner than originally expected: â€œI will
    certainly defend the proposition that the crust is made of a very
                                          .
    aluminum plagioclase-rich rocks, . . anorthosite gabbro or gabbroic
                 ..
    anorthosite, . far from a basalt. I think that the chemistry of the
    surface rocks, . . . and the returned rocks bear this out and if the
    crust is thin, it reduces the likelihood that it is any different composi-
    tion than what we see at the surface.â€ (Transcript)
* Nearly half billion dollars worth of equipment, mostly junk, had been
    left on lunar surface during six Apollo landings, Chicago Tribune
    reported. List included rocket engines, electronic devices, golf ball
    driven by Apollo 14 commander Alan B. Shepard, Jr., feather left by
    Apollo 15 commander David R. Scott (who had dropped feather and
    hammer simultaneously during televised extravehicular activity to
    show that they both fell at same rate in vacuum), and 12 prs of boots
    costing $4000 a pair. Boots included those that ApoZZo I1 Commander
    Neil A. Armstrong had used to make first footprints on moon. Tech-
    nological items left on moon included 5 S-IVB rocket engines costing
    $20 million each, 6 $4O-million lunar modules, 3 lunar rovers at $2
    million each, TV and photography equipment costing $5 million, 12
    backpacks costing $3.6 million, and assorted tools valued at $600 000.

December 17: Apollo 1 7 orbital science briefing was held at Manned
    Spacecraft Center while astronauts continued flight homeward from
    moon. Data from laser altimeter and S-band gravity experiments were
    described by Dr. Wilbur R. Wollenhaupt, Chief of MSC Experiments
    Support Section and S-band transponder coinvestigator. Profiles of
    near-side lunar basins appeared to be flat and depressed with sur-
    rounding terrain. Far side appeared mountainous. Copernicus Crater
    was deficiency region; Sinus Aestuum, Mare Serenitatis, and Mare
    Crisium were high regions; and Littrow landing site was low.
       Harold Masursky of US. Geological Survey, member of Apollo
    Orbital Science Photographic Team, said panoramic camera aboard
    ApoUo 1 7 had â€œacted better than on the two previous flights [Apollo
    15 and 161, and we essentially accomplished the tasks assigned to it.â€
    During Apollo 1 7 mission â€œwe saw the successful rectification of the
    15 and 16 panoramic photographs, and they looked very good indeed.
    So, hopefully, we will have the rectification of 17 done shortly and
    put out a series of photomosaics, putting the high-resolution panoramic
    frames together into what we think will be the best series of maps that
    we have developed for the Moon.â€ Correlation of photography with
    gravity tracking and laser altimetry had produced â€œa great deal of
    dataâ€ to confirm earlier interpretations from Apollo 15 that lunar
    front side was low and that â€œlargest area of mare material on the front
                                  .
    side is an ocean basin floor, . . not a result of the impact as the large
    gravity anomalies indicate in the impact basin.â€
       Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist Walter E. Brown reported lunar
    sounder experiment had â€œbehaved about as we expected except that
    there were a couple of surprises.â€ Experimenters had expected that
                                         ...
    â€˜â€˜over the Mare, the smooth areas,       weâ€™d have a reasonably smooth,
    well-behaved echo, and over the mountainous area it might bounce
    around a little bit.â€ Sounder data had shown â€œit was fairly smooth
    over the mountains and it bounced around over the Mare.â€ Until
                                                        .
    mission film was returned, â€œwe wonâ€™t know . . just exactly what is
                       .. .
    going on, but itâ€™s     extremely interesting.â€
       Dr. Frank J. Low of Univ. of Arizona and Rice Univ. said scanning
    radiometer experiment performance â€œwas essentially perfect.â€ It pro-
    duced coverage of about one third of the surface area of the moon
    and made some 100 million independent temperature measurements.
    With â€œbeautiful Atlas of thermal measurements generated by this
    magnificent flight,â€ scientists had â€œfoundation of a new technique for
    exploration of planetary surfaces without atmospheres.â€
       Johns Hopkins Univ. scientist William E. Fastie said far-ultraviolet
                                               ... and all of the observations
    spectrometer had â€œperformed perfectly
    that were intended were accomplished.â€ Experiment had detected
    neither major nor minor constituents of atmosphere. â€œAnd, pending
                                 ...
    further analysis, we have          identified only one trace constituent
                                                               ..
    of the lunar atmosphere. The immediate conclusion .            is, that the
    Moon is not outgassing, because the only other possible gases that
    could be in the lunar atmosphere are neon and argon, and neither
    of them are the primordial atmosphere of the Moon.â€

         Mood of briefing was conveyed by Apollo orbital science program
    scientist Floyd I. Roberson: â€œI think weâ€™ve got a lot of tools in our
    hands now and we sit up here and weâ€™re all tired and we talk about
    the results of our experiments and maybe we donâ€™t convey the excite-
    ment thatâ€™s upon us. But, we really feel that this is a beginning as far
    as lunar science is concerned, as far as the Apollo data is concerned,
    and weâ€™re really going to get there now.â€ (Transcript)
  New York Times editorial praised Apollo program in which US. had
    â€œattained one of its finest hours.â€ Astronauts had gone to moon in
    â€œspirit of peace and selflessness.â€ They had been â€œseeking knowledge,
    not gold or slaves or other wealth. They went there consciously as
    representatives of all mankind, not as imperialists seeking to bring
    the moon under the Stars and Stripes. What they learned has been
    made available to all peoples and all nations without any request for
    a quid pro quo. In the atmosphere created by Project Apollo-with
    its constant reminder that what united men is stronger than what
    divides them-it was easier to reduce cold war tensions, to end the
    original space race, and to begin genuine international collaboration
    in cosmic exploration. Project Apollo has helped consecrate the moon
    and space to the cause of peace and cooperation among all men.
    This has been a glorious adventure in whose successful outcome the
    people of America and of the world can properly take pride.â€ (NYT,

* President Nixon issued statement on US. space program following splash-

    mand module America marks the end of one of the most significant
    chapters in the history of human endeavor. In October 1958, this
    Nation set about sending men into a hostile, unknown environment. We
    had little idea what lay before us, but there was new knowledge to
    be gained and there was a heritage of meetine; historical challenge-
    the challenge of greatness-to be sustained. Project Mercury, begun
     in 1958, taught us that man could survive and work in space. In 1961,
     President Kennedy voiced the determination of the United States to
     place a man on the moon. We gained the understanding and the tech-
     nology to embark on this great mission through Project Gemini and
     we accomplished it with the Apollo lunar exploration series. In 1969,
     for the first time, men from the planet Earth set foot on the moon.
       â€œSince the beginning of Apollo, nine manned flights have been

    edge of the means of human existence to find, perhaps, the meaning
    of human existence.
       â€œNor is this great work ending with the return of Gene Cernan,
    Jack Schmitt, and Ron Evans from the moon today. Rather it has
    barely begun. As Sir Isaac Newton attributed his accomplishments
    to the fact that he stood â€˜upon the shoulders of Giants,â€™ so Newton
    himself is one of the giants upon whose shoulders we now stand as we
    reach for the stars. The great mathematician once wrote: â€˜I do not
    know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have
    been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in
    now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than
    ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before
    me.â€™ I believe we have finally moved into the great ocean and we are
    trying now to understand what surrounds us.
        â€œThe making of space history will continue, and this Nation means
    to play a major role in its making. Next spring, the Skylab will be
    put into orbit. It will be aimed not at advancing exploration of deep
    space, but at gaining in space new knowledge for the improvement
    of life here on earth. It will help develop new methods of learning
    about the earthâ€™s environment and the earthâ€™s resources, and new
    methods of evaluating programs aimed at preserving and enhancing
    the resources of all the world. It will seek new knowledge about our
    own star, the sun, and about its tremendous influence on our environ-
    ment. Scientists aboard the Skylab will perform medical experiments
     aimed at a better knowledge of manâ€™s own physiology. Also, they will
     perform experiments aimed at developing new industrial processes
    utilizing the unique capabilities found in space. Skylab will be our
    first manned space station. It will be in use for the better part of a
    year, permitting the economy of extended usage, and laying the ground-
     work for further space stations.
                                                                         . ..
        â€œEconomy in space will be further served by the Space Shuttle .
     It will enable us to ferry space research hardware into orbit without
     requiring the full expenditure of a launch vehicle as is necessary
     today. It will permit us to place that hardware in space accurately,
     and to serve or retrieve it when necessary instead of simply writing
     it o f f in the event it malfunctions or fails. In addition, the Shuttle
     will provide such routine access to space that for the first time per-
     sonnel other than trained astronauts will be able to participate and

    where, in time, we shall surely follow.
       â€œThough our ancestors would have called the deeds of Apollo
    miraculous, we do not see our age as an age of miracles. Rather,
    we deal in facts, we deal in scientific realities, we deal in industrial
    capacity, and technological expertise, and in the belief that men can
    do whatever they turn their hands to. For all this, however, can we
    look at the record of 24 men sent to circle the moon or to stand
    upon it, and 24 men returned to earth alive and well, and not see
    Godâ€™s hand in it?
       â€œPerhaps, in spite of ourselves, we dâ€™o still live in an Age of
    Miracles. So if there is self-congratulation, let it be tempered with
    awe, and our pride with prayer, and as we enter this special time of

  Manâ€™s lunar theories were undergoing major revision because of Apollo
    17, Wall Street Journal said. Observations by astronauts of orange
    soil on moon-clue to past volcanic activity-had promoted review
    of Apollo 14 color photos. Review had disclosed brown and orange
    discolorations on dome in crater Langrenus. Orange soil meant there
    might be other relatively young volcanic features. Discovery could
    result in major revision of thermal theories of moon. ( WSJ, 12/19/72)

    supersonic transport scheduled for service in 1975. He had been
    regarded as originator of all-metal aircraft, which he first designed
    in early 1920s. In 1934 he had built huge eight-engine aircraft with
    63-m (207-ft ) wingspan. Aircraft, named Maxim Gorky after Russian
    author, actually flew, but was demolished in 1935 crash. Tupolev, one

    one Lenin Prize and was three-time Hero of Socialist Labor-highest
    Soviet civilian honor. He had been imprisoned in 1936 for allegedly
    divulging Soviet aviation secrets to Germany. During three years of

e Discovery through infrared measurements that Titan, largest of Saturnâ€™s
    six moons, had minimum temperature of 205 K (-90Â°F), same as
    atmosphere in which life originated on earth 2 billion yrs ago, was
    discussed by Cornel1 Univ. astronomer Dr. Carl E. Sagan in interview
    published by Wmhington Post. Discovery had been made by Cornel1
    Univ. and Univ. of Minnesota astronomers using infrared measure-
    ments. Titan was about 1.5 billion km (900 million mi) from sun and
    received only one percent of sunlight that earth received. â€œWe have
    to ask ourselves what kind of a planet would make this atmosphere so
    far from sun. The only answer we have been able to come up with is
    something identical to our primeval earth. Possible life form on Titan
    would not be earthlike, â€œbut it would be earth chauvinism to think
    that no form of life whatever could survive so far off in the solar
    system.â€ Dr. Sagan believed Titan was made up of chemical ice, except

                               Summary
During 1972: US. orbited 39 spacecraft in 30 launches-including ApolZo
    16â€™s 4 payloads and ApoZZo 17â€™s 3. U.S.S.R. orbited 89 payloads in
    74 launches. Italy launched one satellite for NASA on NASA booster.
    And. Japan launched one spacecraft on its own booster. US. total
    included 16 payloads orbited by Dept. of Defense in 13 launches and
    23 by NASA in 17 straight flawless launches-NASAâ€™s first perfect
    annual launch record.
               Apollo program came to successful conclusion with ApoZZo 17,
       NASAâ€™s
    most productive of all NASA lunar landing missions and most scien-
    tifically rewarding. ApoZZo 17,sixth successful manned landing mission,
    set records for longest manned lunar landing flight (301 hrs 51 min),
    largest lunar sample return (115 kg; 250 lbs), longest total extra-
    vehicular activity time (22 hrs 5 min) , and longest time in lunar orbit
     (147 hrs 48 min). Earlier in year ApoZZo 16 also produced valuable
    data from surface and lunar orbit investigations.
       Unmanned NASA program was highlighted by Pioneer 10,first space-
    craft to fly beyond Mars orbit, first to penetrate Asteroid Belt, first
    intended to look at Jupiter close up, and first destined to escape solar
    system. At yearâ€™s end Pioneer 10 had passed safely through three
    fourths of Asteroid Belt. Mariner 9, launched in 1971, had circled
    Mars 698 times, photographing Martian moons and completely mapping
    planetâ€™s surface before Oct. 27, 1972, shutdown. Findings revised
    previous concepts of Mars, showing planet to be geologically active,
    with volcanic mountains higher than any mountain on earth, with a
    crevasse three to four times deeper than Grand Canyon, and with
    indications that free-flowing water might once have existed on Mars.
    Erts 1, first Earth Resources Technology Satellite, laid groundwork
    for global inventory of earthâ€™s resources and environment. Copernicus
     (Oao 3) Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, with largest telescope
    placed in space, set new standards of pointing accuracy and opened new
     channels of information on far reaches of universe. Nimbus 5 meteoro-
    logical satellite demonstrated new techniques for daytime and night-
    time temperature readings through clouds at all levels in atmosphere.
        Other unmanned missions included Explorer 47 (IMP) to study
    earth-sun interactions from orbit halfway to moon, Expâ‚¬orer 48 (SAS;
    launched for NASA by Italy) to survey gamma ray sources, Noaa 2
     weather satellite for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
    tion, and Triad 01-1X Transit satellite for Navy. Two dozen space-
    craft orbited in earlier years continued to return data on solar system
    and universe beyond.
        All components of Skylab manned orbital research satellite were
     assembled at Kennedy Space Center for 1973 launch. Three flight crews
    and two backup crews began training. Final space shuttle design was
    selected and prime contract for shuttle orbiter development was
     awarded, as well as main engine contract. Contractors had progressed

    of its creation in 1947 as Muroc Flight Test Unit of National Advisory
    Committee for Aeronautics. NASA TF-8A jet aircraft with supercritical
    wing was flown in configuration planned for future flights. Digital
    fly-by-wire computerized control system was demonstrated in series
    of flights from FRC. System, for potential use in space shuttle, en-
    hanced aircraft handling and reduced pilot workload. NASA awarded
    contract to refine design of quiet, jet, propulsive-lift, experimental
    aircraft QUESTOL in major effort to develop technology for short
    takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft to relieve airport congestion.
    Progress was made in quiet jet engine, techniques to reduce aircraft
    emissions, composite materials, avionics, aerodynamics including super-
    critical and antisymmetrical wings, general-aviation safety, supersonic
    and hypersonic research, and research in basic materials and structures.
       In sounding rocket program, more than 80 successful flights were
    made to study atmosphere, ionosphere, auroras and airglow, geomag-
    netic storms, meteor streams, and trapped radiation fluctuations; to
    make astronomical observations in x-ray, ultraviolet, and radio regions
    of electromagnetic spectrum; for special projects; and for support.
    NASA flew 61 balloon flights in its program to study near-earth
    phenomena, including balloon that lifted 545 kg (1200 Ibs) of sci-
    entific equipment to 45 000-m (148000-ft) altitude.
       U.S.S.R. launches decreased from record 83 in 1971 to 74. The
    89 payloads included 72 Cosmos satellites, 3 Intercosmos, 1 Luna, 3
    Meteor, 2 Prognoz, 3 Molniya I, 3 Molniya 11, 1 Venus, and secondary
    payload Sret I (launched for France).

    of technology applications to improve conditions on earth brought

During 1972: Conclusion of the Apollo program was commemorated by Scott Longâ€™s
cartoon, published in the Minneapolis Tribune Dec. 6. The manned lunar explorations
had given man a new awareness of the earth and the need to preserve it, as well as a
wealth of information on the moon and possible origins of the earth and solar system.

       New space program for 1970s was designed to be funded at constant
     budget level over several years-yet to maintain space flight capability,
     contribute to national security, increase opportunities for new scientific
     knowledge, encourage international cooperation, address problems of

   Reusable shuttle was expected to give â€œro              to spaceâ€ by cut-
   ting complexity and cost of launches and                uses of satellites.
   It could be used for both manned and unmanned missions and, in
   military use, could serve national security.
       Revision of NASA FY 1972 program to phase in new programs while
   holding expenditures to $3.4-billion budget level required basic changes
   in planning. Further stretch-out of period over which NASA long-term
   objectives in space and science could be achieved was necessary.
   Shuttle configuration costs were pared to about half of original cost
   estimate; plans for Grand Tour missions to explore all five outer
   planets in late 1970s were cut back to focus on Jupiter and Saturn
   with less expensive spacecraft; and NASA and Atomic Energy Com-
   missionâ€™s nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (NERVA) pro-
   gram was terminated. Emphasis on aeronautics was increased at urging
   of congressional committees, but $44.9 million of $50.5-million NASA
   FY 1973 appropriation for aircraft noise suppression program, engine
    retrofit studies, and quiet, experimental, short takeoff and landing
    (QUESTOL) aircraft program was impounded by Office of Management
    and Budget. Tight NASA funding and end of Apollo program brought
    reductions in personnel, especially at manned space-flight Centers.
    NASA total in-house personnel decreased by 1181 from Dee. 31, 1971,
    to 27 801 persons Dec. 31, 1972, with further cuts scheduled for 1973.
    Marshall Space Flight Center employment was reduced by 258, to
    5501 persons; Manned Space Center 159, to 3882; and Kennedy
    Space Center 123, to 2518.
       Employment in aerospace industry throughout the Nation also de-
    clined slightly, from 924000 workers at end of 1971 to 917000 at
    end of 1972, despite infusion of space shuttle program. Aerospace
    industry remained largest manufacturing employer, however, and
    industry sales increased for first time since 1968.
       To emphasize transition from Apollo to Skylab and shuttle activities,
    NASA established new Mission and Payload Integration Office within
    Office of Manned Space Fli ht. Space Station Task Force became
    Sortie Lab Task Force. Apolfo Program Office became Apollo/ASTP
    Office to prepare for 1975 US.-Soviet mission. Office of Advanced
    Research and Technology (OART) was renamed Office of Aeronautical
    and Space Technology (OAST) to emphasize increasing NASA aero-
    nautical activity. Office of Applications had been separated from
    Office of Space Science at end of 1971 to increase emphasis on use
    of space technology for benefits on earth. Charles W. Mathews, Deputy
    Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight since 1968, headed
    new Office of Applications.

    Saturn V launch vehicle for Apollo moon missions was his major
    engineering achievement.
       In technology utilization, NASA continued to distribute information
    about aerospace technology to private and public sectors of national
    economy at ever-increasing rate. NASA-developed technology was being
    used in medicine, nondestructive testing, and engineering design.
    NASTRAN computer program to analyze structures under stress was used
    by more than 70 industrial firms, universities, laboratories, and govern-
    ment agencies to solve structural engineering problems.
       Technology and interpretive systems developed by NASA in coopera-
    tion with other agencies prepared way for worldwide environmental
    pollution and monitoring network.
       NASA FY 1973 appropriation of $3.408 billion was equivalent to
    budget request and $110 million above FY 1972 appropriation of
    $3.298 billion. Increase reflected funds for design and development
    of space shuttle. (A&A 1972; Fletcher testimony, 2/28/73; MA
    Aerospace, 3/73; NASA Pocket Stutzktics, 3/72, 1/73)
  In international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched Euro-
    pean Space Research Organizationâ€™s Heos 2 to study interplanetary
    space and magnetosphere, Esro 4 to investigate solar ionosphere, and
    TD-1 A astronomical observatory satellite) that carried seven experi-
    ments from six European universities and research organizations.
    NASA also launched Anik 1 (TeZesat A ) domestic communications
    satellite for Telesat Canada, Aeros scientific satellite in joint U.S.-
    West German project, and Oscar 6 (developed by US., German, and
    Australian radio amateurs) for Radio Amateur Satellite Corp.-in

       May 24 agreement signed in Moscow by President Nixon and Soviet
    Premier Aleksey N. Kosygin on cooperation in peaceful uses of outer
    space included Apollo Soyuz Test Project in which Apollo spacecraft
    would rendezvous and dock with Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in earth
    orbit. Mission was scheduled for July 1975 and meetings in US.
    and U.S.S.R. advanced project to point of testing models of s acecraft
    linking device. US. and U.S.S.R. exchanged data from 1971 A fminer 9
     and Mars 2 and 3 probes of planet Mars.
       After series of meetings in US. and abroad, ESRO decided to
     develop sortie laboratory to fly with NASAâ€™sspace shuttle in 1980s.
       President Nixon announced new policy making US. launch assistance
     available to interested countries and international organizations for
     satellites intended for peaceful purposes.
       Third Annual Lunar Science Conference at Lunar Science Institute
     in January was attended by more than 600 researchers from US.
     and 17 foreign countries. Participating Soviet scientists consulted with
     US. scientists, examined lunar samples, and helped select ApoZlo 14
     samples to return to U.S.S.R. as part of U.S.-U.S.S.R. exchange agree
    ment. ApoWo 15 lunar soil samples were exchanged for soil samples
     collected by U.S.S.R.â€™s Luna 20. ApoZZo 16 materials were distributed
     to scientists in 15 foreign countries, and ApoZZo 17 samples also would
     be distributed to other nations for analysis and display.

* Aerospace industry sales increased for first time since 1968. Sales for
    1972 were $23.5 billion, up 5.9% over 1971. Commercial aerospace
    sales increased 11.670, to reach estimated $4.8 billion. Increase
    reflected increase in deliveries of helicopters and general-aviation
    aircraft. Major aerospace sales included $13.8 billion to Dept. of
    Defense, up from $12.6 billion to DOD in 1971; missile sales to DOD
    at $5.2 billion, up from $4.7 billion; and military aircraft sales at
    $8.1 billion, up from $7.4 billion.
       Space sales continued to declive in 1972, to $3.0 billion from $3.2
    billion in 1971. Utility and executive aircraft sales increased from
    $321 million in 1971 to $500 million-up        55.8%. Units delivered
    increased 23.2%. Civilian helicopter sales increased from $69 million
    in 1971 to $95 million in 1972, gain of 37.7%
       Aerospace exports declined for first time since 1964-from        $4.2
    billion in 1971 to $3.9 billion, 6.6% decrease. Major reason for
    decline was drop in military aerospace exports-down 23.8% from
    $1.1 billion in 1971 to $854 million in 1972. Aerospace imports in
    1972 were valued at $500 million, increase of 34.0% from $373 million
    in 1971. Aerospace industry profits were expected to increase from
    1.8% in 1971 to 2.2%.
       Aerospace industry employment declined from 924 000 in December
    1971 to estimated 917000 in December 1972, but industry remained
    Nationâ€™s largest manufacturing employer. (AIA Aerospace, 3/73, 3)
* Worldwide scheduled airline industry increased 14% in scheduled
    traffic over 1971-double 1971 growth rate. Total 1972 t r a c was
    estimated at 47 120 million ton-miles. Revenue-passenger-miles flown
    increased 13% over 1971, with estimated 450 million passengers
    flown. U.S. international carriers showed 22.5% increase in revenue-
    passenger-miles, with 12% increase in available seat-miles. Load
    factors rose 4.8% over 50% level of 1971. U.S. domestic carriers
    increased revenue-passenger-miles 11.20J0, with only 1.9% increase
    in available seat-miles. Average load factor rose to 52.4% from 48%
    in 1971. (Av Wk,1/8/73, 22)

      craft weighing more than 5700 kg (12 500 lbs). World accident rate
      in terms of facilities per 100 000 flight-hours was 0.126, up from 0.094
      in 1971 and highest rate since 1969â€™s 0.134. Number of actual deaths
      in U.S. airline accidents dropped from 203 in 1971 to 190 in 1972.

      Series of lectures, presented originally in colloquia at Univ. of Ala-
      bama 1970-1971, had been sponsored by Marshall Space Flight Centerâ€™s
      Aero-Astrodynamics Laboratory. Major topics covered were dynamics
      and transient state of upper atmosphere, chemical composition of upper
      atmosphere, and solar flare forecasting. Flare forecasting â€œfiascoâ€ was
      described by Frederick W. Ward, Jr., Air Force Cambridge Laboratories
      physicist : Forecasters dreamed of dixovering cause, energy source,
      and antecedent conditions for solar flares. â€œThis â€˜tunnel visionâ€™ has
      had a profound and deleterious effect on the state-of-the-art. It has
      diverted attention from many promising approaches and relegated
      them to limbo. More importantly, it has actually inhibited the scientific
      search for the underlying physical mechanisms.â€ Examples of neglected
      aspects ranged from observing techniques and equipment to avail-
      ability and accuracy of archived data. Inspection of available data
      â€œleads to an obvious conclusion: there are at least two suns up there.â€

                    A CHRONICLE FOR 1972

   The following tabulation was compiled from open sources by Leonard C     .
Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library of Congress.
Sources included the United Nations Public Registry; the Satellite Situa-
tion Report compiled by the Operations Control Center at Goddard Space
Flight Center; and public information releases of the Department of De-
fense, NASA, NOAA, and other agencies, as well as those of the Communications
Satellite Corporation. Russian data are from the U.N. Public Registry,
the Satellite Situation Report, translations from the Tass News Agency,
statements in the Soviet press, and international news services reports.
Data on satellites of other foreign nations are from the U.N. Public Registry,
the Satellite Situation Report, governmental announcements, and inter-
national news services reports.
   This tabulation lists payloads that have (a) orbited; (b) as probes,
ascended to at least the 6500-kilometer (4000-mile) altitude that tradi-
tionally has distinguished probes from sounding rockets, etc.; or (c)
conveyed one or more human beings into space, whether orbit was attained
or not. Furthermore, only flights that have succeeded-or at least can be
shown by tracking data to have fulfilled our definition of satellite or probe
or manned flight-are listed. Date of launch is referenced to local time at
the launch site. An asterisk by the date marks dates that are one day earlier
in this tabulation than in listings which are referenced to Greenwich Mean
Time. A double asterisk by the date marks dates of Soviet launches which
are a day later in this compilation than in listings which are referenced
 to Greenwich Mean Time.
   World space activity decreased for the first time in three years. There
was a decrease in the total successful launches-106 against 120 in 1971,
 the lowest since 1964--and     a sharp drop in total payloads orbited-126
 against 151 in 1971. The difference between launches and payloads is of
 course accounted for by the multiple-payload launches (DOD, the principal
 user of this system in the past, made 3 multiple launches in 1972, orbiting
 6 payloads; NASA made only 1multiple launch, with 2 payloads; the U.S.S.R.
 made 3 multiple launches, orbitin 18 payloads).
                                 rf:
    Of the 1972 world total, the nited States launched 30 boosters carry-
 ing 35 payloads (counting the Apollo 16 and 17 payloads as 1 for each
 mission). In 1971 29 US. boosters launched 47 payloads. Although the
 US. 1972 launch total increased by 1, its payload total was the lowest since
 1961. Of these 1972 totals, DOD was responsible for 13 launches and 16

payloads. Of NASAâ€™s launches, 8 were non-NASA missions-Intehd-Iv
                        17
F-4 and Zntelsat-ZV F-5 for ComSatCorp, Heos 2, TD-lA, and Esro 4 for
ESRO, Anik 1 for Canada, Aeros for West Germany, and Triad 01-1X for
the US. Navy. The Soviet Union once again more than doubled United
States space totals, launching 89 payloads with 74 launches. It had launched
97 payloads with a record 83 launches in 1971.
   The year was very successful for both manned and unmanned activity.
The US. completed its Apollo program of manned lunar exploration with
two immensely successful flights. Apollo 16 explored the moonâ€™s Descartes
region and returned with 96.6 kg (213 lbs) of lunar samples. Apollo 17,
the sixth and last manned lunar landing, was the most productive and most
scientifically rewarding. Among its many records, this longest of manned
lunar landing flights spent the longest time in lunar orbit, conducted the
longest total EVA on the moon, and returned with the largest sample of
                                  .
lunar material (115 kg ; 250 lbs) Pioneer 10, launched early in the year,
successfully streaked through the Asteroid Belt toward its December 1973
Jupiter flyby objective and would eventually become the first spacecraft
to escape the solar system. NASA also launched Erts I, the first of a series
Qf experimental satellites to monitor the earthâ€™s resources and environment ;
Oao 3, the largest telescope ever placed in space; Nimbus 5, a more
sophisticated experimental meteorological satellite; and Anik 1 for Canada,
which became the worldâ€™s first operational domestic communications
satellite system.
    The Soviet Union scored a major interplanetary success with the soft-
landing on Venus of a capsule from Venus 8, which conducted the first
soil analysis of another planet. Luna 20 continued a series of unmanned
 Soviet lunar accomplishments with its successful lunar landing and retrieval
 of lunar soil. The U.S.S.R., in a typically active year, also orbited six
 communications satellites, including an improved second-generation series,
 and three Meteor weather satellites.
    Also during 1972, Japan launched its fourth satellite, the second one to
 carry scientific instruments. Italy launched the U.S.-built Explorer 48
 on a NASA vehicle from its launch facility off the coast of Kenya. And the
 Soviet Union launched a French-built scientific satellite, Sret I, as a
 secondary payload. It was the first of three planned launches in a coopera-
 tive French-Soviet program.
    As we have cautioned in previous years, the â€œRemarksâ€ column of these
 appendixes is never complete, because of the inescapable lag behind each
 flight of the analysis and interpretation of results.

                            Appendix B
 CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR NASA LAUNCHES, 1972

   This chronology of major NASA launches in 1972 is intended to provide
an accurate and ready historical reference, compiling and verifying in-
formation previously scattered in several sources. It includes launches of
all rocket vehicles larger than sounding rockets launched either by NASA
or under â€œNASA directionâ€ (e.g., in 1972 NASA provided vehicles and launch
facilities and launched the Communications Satellite Corporationâ€™s two
Intelsat IV satellites and the European Space Research Organizationâ€™s
Heos 2, TD-lA, and Esro 4, as well as Anik 1 for Canada, Aeros for
West Germany, Triad 01-1X for the US. Navy, and Nom 2 for the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; also, under a NASA
and University of Rome agreement, an Italian team launched a NASA satel-
lite, Explorer 48, from Italyâ€™s San Marco platform ofâ‚¬ the coast of Kenya,
on NASAâ€™s   Scout booster). During 1972, NASA achieved its first perfect
annual record, experiencing no launch or mission failures.
   An attempt has been made to classify performance of both the launch
vehicle and the payload and to summarize total results in terms of primary
mission. Three categories have been used for evaluating vehicle perform-
ance and mission results-successful (S) , partially successful (P), and
unsuccessful (U). A fourth category, unknown (Unk), has been added for
payloads when vehicle malfunctions did not give the payload a chance to
exercise its main experiments. These divisions are necessarily arbitrary;
many of the results cannot be neatly categorized. Also they ignore the fact
that a great deal is learned from missions that may have been classified
as unsuccessful.
   Date of launch is referenced to local time at the launch site. Open sources
were used, verified when in doubt with the project offices in NASA Head-
quarters and with NASA Centers. For further information on each item,
see Appendix A of this volume and the entries in the main chronology as
referenced in the index. The information was compiled in May 1973 by
Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology Division of the Library
of Congress.

 CHRONOLOGY OF MANNED SPACE FLIGHT, 1972

   This chronology contains basic information on all manned space flights
during 1972 and-taken with Appendix C to the 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969,
1970, and 1971 volumes of this publication-provides a summary record
of manned exploration of the space environment through 1972. The infor-
mation was complied by Leonard C. Bruno of the Science and Technology
Division of the Library of Congress.
   Compared with 1971, 1972 saw a halving of manned space flight, mainly
attributable to U.S.S.R. inactivity. While two US. Apollo and two U.S.S.R.
Soyuz flights placed a total of 12 men in space during 1971, 1972 saw two
Apollo flights and no Soyuz mission, for a total of 6 men in space.
   Apollo 16, launched in April, continued to improve and to extend US.
manned lunar capability by spending more than 20 hours exploring the
moonâ€™s surface and returning with 96.6 kg (213 lbs) of lunar samples.
The Apollo program was brought to a highly successful conclusion with
the near-perfect December flight of ApoZlo 17. Breaking nearly all previous
manned lunar exploration records, the Apollo 17 mission was the longest
and most productive. The two-man crew spent some 22 hours exploring the
moonâ€™s surface and returned with 115 kg (250 lbs) of lunar material. With
this sixth and last manned lunar landing, 12 men had walked on the moon
and spent nearly 12% days on its surface. They had returned a total of
about 380 kg (841 lbs) of lunar rocks and soil to earth for future study.
   The Soviet Union made no manned flight attempts during 1972, ap-
parently still recovering from the tragic June 1971 flight of Soyuz 11
that resulted in the death of its three-man crew.
    By the end of 1972, the United States had conducted a total of 27
manned space flights-2 suborbital, 16 in earth orbit, 3 in lunar orbit, and
6 lunar landings-with a total of 34 different crewmen. Of the 34 American
astronauts, 9 had participated in two flights each, 5 had flown three times,
and 2 had flown four times. The Soviet Union had made 18 manned flights,
all in earth orbit, with 25 cosmonauts. Three had participated in two flights
each and two had flown three times. Cumulative totals for manned spacecraft
hours in flight had reached 3526 hours 27 minutes for the United States
and remained at 2097 hours 16 minutes for the Soviet Union. Cumulative
total man-hours in space were 9499 hours 30 minutes for the United States
and remained 4403 hours 12 minutes for the U.S.S.R.
    Data on US. flights are the latest available to date within NASA,
 although minor details are subject to modification as data are refined.
