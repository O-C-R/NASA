• The strongest nation will be the one that applies chemistry most effectively, wrote Science editor Philip Abelson in Saturday Review: "The long-range interests of this nation require a strong chemical profession and basic to it are strong chemistry departments in the universities. Yet, while NASA was receiving an annual $5 billion, a sum that represented almost all the money asked by the agency, chemistry received only a small fraction of its requests. ... In my estimation, chemistry, for the long haul, is ten to 100 times as important as space, yet it receives only about one percent as much money.” (SR, 1/1/66, 102)
January 2: Changes in organizational structure of NASA Hq. were effective this date. Most important change was establishment of an organizational unit called the Office of the Administrator, which included the Deputy Administrator and his staff, the Associate Administrator and his staff, and the Executive Secretariat. Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., newly appointed Deputy Administrator, was continuing to serve as Associate Administrator. Willis H. Shapley, Associate Deputy Administrator, serving as the principal assistant to Administrator James E. Webb and to Dr. Seamans, was responsible for policy planning and for general supervision of the agency’s work processes. The Executive Secretariat, headed by Col. Lawrence W. Vogel (usa), was responsible for channeling and scheduling work within the Office of the Administrator. Earl D. Hilburn continued as Deputy Associate Administrator.

•	gsfc Nimbus Project Manager Harry Press told Aviation Week that
Nimbus B would move nasa’s weather satellite program into a second generation research and development effort by starting the measurement of fundamental quantities in the atmosphere necessary in new analytical weather-forecasting formulas. Nimbus B, third and largest in nasa’s meteorological satellite series, would carry seven major experiments: infrared interferometer spectrometer; satellite infrared spectrometer; image dissector camera system; high-resolution infrared radiometer; monitor for ultraviolet solar energy; medium-resolution infrared radiometer; and interrogation, recording, locating system. In addition, Nimbus B would carry Snap-19 radioisotope thermal generators capable of producing 60 w of power to supplement solar panels and determine feasibility of radioisotope generators for ultimate operational weather satellite system. Scheduled for launch in 1967 with Extended Thrust Augmented Thor-Agena D launch vehicle, Nimbus B would use basic Nimbus spacecraft configuration, but would require strengthened structural elements because of its additional weight.
Press said the two major control difficulties which had shortened the August 1964 nimbus i mission had been analyzed and corrected on Nimbus C, scheduled for launch in 1966. A larger solar array drive motor, equipped with heat-conducting strap that would lower operating temperature of motor almost 100°C and with improved grease, would be substituted on Nimbus C for smaller motor whose failure had left NIMBUS i’s solar panels locked in near-vertical position when it apparently overheated and its grease failed to lubricate. Also, attempts would be made during Nimbus C mission to rely on the flywheels to
dampen spacecraft oscillations and to use the gas thruster system as little as possible, Press said, nimbus i had spun about its roll axis when its depreciating power supply had caused its batteries to feed lower voltages to the attitude control electronics system and the thrusters had fired excessive amounts of cold freon gas.

January 3: Report of the White House Committee on Meteorology concluded that global weather experiment using meteorological satellite and network of sensors on constant-altitude balloons, remote land stations, and ocean buoys could be deployed in four years for $50 million. Assignment of overall management responsibility given to single agency to begin design study was discussed in Aviation Week. Designated Ghost (global horizontal sounding technique), project would attempt to extend atmospheric measurements to that 90% of the earth’s surface not yet adequately covered, using meteorological satellite in 600-mi.-altitude polar orbit to obtain pair of readings from all global points every 12 hrs. In addition, 1,000 to 3,000 super-pressure balloons would be floated at six different atmospheric levels to measure wind, pressure, temperature, humidity, and overpressure.
nasa Nimbus B meteorological satellite, scheduled for launch in 1967, would carry interrogation, recording, and locating system experiment (Iris) designed to perform ranging and data collection function on which Ghost was based. However, nasa would attempt only limited experiments with Iris involving a check of the system’s ability to locate fixed sensor packages, and track them on slow-moving and fast-moving platforms, Dr. Morris Tepper, Director, Meteorological Programs Div., NASA Office of Space Science and Applications, told Aviation Week. Tepper said any agency providing its own transponders and funding its own equipment could participate in the Iris tests. (Av. Wk., 1/3/66,55)

January 4: nasa mariner iv, launched from etr Nov. 28, 1964, for Mars flyby July 14, 1965, was 216 million miles from earth—greatest distance it would reach before gradually returning to within 30 million miles in 1967—and still operating. Goldstone Tracking Station of NASA’s Deep Space Network (dsn) tracked a signal from the spacecraft, but no attempt was made to receive data because of the extreme distance, dsn

January 5: A ten-year lunar exploration program emphasizing manned missions was recommended in reports released by six working groups of scientists who had attended nasa 1965 Summer Conference on Lunar Exploration and Science in Falmouth, Mass., July 19-31, 1965. Program, which would utilize capabilities already under development by NASA, would gradually include scientific experiments in geology, geochemistry, geophysics, and bioscience. One or two manned lunar missions and one manned lunar orbital mission would be conducted annually through 1979, with astronauts remaining on the moon’s surface for longer periods after 1974.
Reports recommended four requirements for period through 1974: (1) assurance of overlapping operation of instruments placed on moon by astronauts; (2) sufficient frequency of missions to provide continuity in experiments; (3) scheduling of adequate time between missions to permit necessary modification of experiments; and (4) gradually increasing staytimes of astronauts on moon. Top priority for early Apollo landing missions would be return of lunar material samples; second priority, emplacing Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (Alsep); third, traversing lunar surface to describe topographic and geological features, supplemented by stereoscopic photography. Report urged immediate testing to determine amounts and effects of atmosphere escaping from Lunar Excursion Module (Lem) and outgassing of astronaut suits. One Apollo Applications-Manned Lunar Orbiter mission (Aa-mlo) was recommended prior to first Apollo Applications-Manned Lunar Surface mission (Aa-mls), with minimum of three manned spacecraft missions in polar orbit to make complete lunar survey; five or six Aa-mls missions through 1974 were suggested, with larger scientific payloads and stays for the astronauts of up to 14 days.
Reports listed basic types of equipment necessary for exploration program: automatic position-recording systems to relay to earth or Lem movements of astronauts and roving vehicles; roving vehicles to carry one or two astronauts and scientific payload of at least 600 lbs.; manned lunar flying vehicle able to carry 300-lb. scientific payload about 10 mi. to study features not accessible with roving vehicle; one-inch drill capable of penetrating at least 10 ft. in rubble or solid rock to assist heat-flow studies and provide samples of possible biological interest. Scientific training for astronauts in specific rather than general areas was recommended, with emphasis on geology.
For post-1974 period, the scientists recommended surface travel by astronauts up to 500 mi. from landing point and fixed-site investigations lasting from two months to a year for measuring geophysical phenomena that could vary with time; studying lunar surface processes; deep-drilling studies to obtain information on early moon history and crustal composition; construction and manning of large radio and optical telescopes. Roving vehicles for the post-Apollo Applications phase should have 500-mi. range, shelter for three-man crew, two-month mission capability, and no requirement to return to starting point.

January 5: Twenty-one Long Tank Thors were purchased from Douglas Missile and Space Systems Div. by usaf for use in its programs at Vandenberg afb. Expected to succeed the present Thrust Augmented Thor (Tat), the Long Tank Thor would provide increased payload capability by enlarging the volume of Thor’s liquid propellant tanks; result would be a 20% increase in payload capability over Tat. Although its total thrust of 330,000 lbs. would be essentially the same as that for Tat, the Long Tank Thor would have a burn time of 216 sec. as compared to 146 sec. for Tat. (afsc Release 205.65)

January 6: 170 usable terrain photographs from gemini v mission flown by Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, Jr., Aug. 21-29, 1965, included pictures of South Africa which would provide valuable information about continental drift, gsfc geologist Dr. Paul D. Lowman said in interim report at NASA Hq. on 13 scientific and technological experiments carried aboard gemini v. Color photos of South Africa’s Namib Desert revealed 7-million to 8-million-year-old rock formations. Presence of similar formations along east coast of South America could indicate two continents had once been closer together, Lowman explained. Photos also pinpointed "a major diamond area” between rock formations and the sand dunes. Kenneth Nagler, U.S. Weather Bureau, told the meeting that gemini V pictures, some in color, had provided meteorologists with more detail of cloud systems than had orbiting Tiros satellites. (Text)

•	Weather modification is a reality, concluded the National Academy of
Sciences’ Panel on Weather and Climate Modification after two-year review of scientific aspects of weather control. In a report submitted to NAS President Dr. Frederick Seitz, recommendations included: (1) immediate study by one agency of research and development in weather modification; (2) raising agency support from 1965 level of $5 million to at least $30 million in 1970; (3) early establishment of several carefully designed, randomized seeding experiments to assess seedability of different storm types; (4) careful monitoring and regulation of operational programs; and (5) full U.S. support and leadership in establishing advanced global observation system. Recognizing that research in the atmospheric sciences would contribute to the goals of weather modification, the committee urged that highest priority be given to studies of: atmospheric water budgets, initially on vapor transport over U.S. areas where potential of cloud seeding is important; boundary-layer energy-exchange processes; theoretical models of condensation and precipitation machines; and meteorological effects of atmospheric pollution, including carbon dioxide. Report strongly urged that appropriate recognition be given to international implications of weather control. (Text; nas Release)

entitled Space Research: Directions for the Future. Report, prepared at nasa’s request, outlined research objectives for planetary and lunar exploration in 1970-1985. Compiled by working group led by Dr. Gordon J. F. MacDonald of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at ucla, Part I repeated nas’ 1964 recommendation that top priority in post-Apollo program be assigned to unmanned exploration of Mars. Report suggested secondary importance be divided equally between detailed investigation of lurain and unmanned exploration of Venus, and completed priority list with other major planets, comets and asteroids, Mercury, Pluto, and interplanetary dust. Major recommendations were: launching an orbiting planetary observatory, delivering a drop sonde to resolve question of high Venusian surface temperature, developing fine-pointing control, accurate to 10 sec. of arc, for rocket guidance, and considering enlargement of NASA deep-space communication capabilities beyond present plans. To support outlined scientific program, report recommended: (1) increasing manpower and facilities available to lunar and planetary science programs; (2) development by nasa of substantial
program for observation of planets through ground-based telescopes; (3) early opportunities for experienced observational scientists to explore the lurain; (4) joint study by nasa ossa and omsf of early use of Saturn V for planetary exploration, with special emphasis on a Martian capsule landing in the early 1970’s; (5) increased attention by NASA to development of research and educational capabilities in theoretical sciences related to study of the solar system. Regarding funding of space research, the report said: ". . . since we believe that the exploration of the solar system bears so directly on the major central scientific questions of our time, we anticipate that unmanned experiments will probably provide the most significant contribution to the program of planetary exploration ... we recommend that the percentage of support of lunar and planetary exploration be maintained over the 1965-1985 time period and be devoted predominantly to scientific objectives and that programs whose objectives are other than scientific be started only as additional resources become available.” It said there should be a gradual shift in emphasis from the moon to the planets, progressing toward nearly equivalent expenditures for lunar and planetary exploration in the 19701985 period.

•	NASA Lewis Research Center, first Government laboratory devoted to flight
propulsion in all its aspects, celebrated its 25th anniversary. Authorized by Congress in 1940, the naca facility was originally called the Aircraft Engine Research Lab.; it was renamed the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in 1948 in honor of Dr. George W. Lewis, former naca Director of Aeronautical Research (1924-47). In 1958, when naca facilities and personnel were absorbed by the newly created nasa, the facility became the Lewis Research Center. From an initial Congressional appropriation of $2 million in 1941, LRC had emerged as a major research and development laboratory valued at $200 million.
Marking the anniversary, lrc Director Dr. Abe Silverstein said: "Man isn’t going to be held to a single conquest or success. The past decade has seen aviation and rocketry undergo phenomenal change, but we’ve just started to realize its potential. The present generation will live to fly better than 2,000 mph in commercial aircraft and to observe at close range the interplanetary exploits of U.S. astronauts. The past 25 years have witnessed truly remarkable strides in aeronautics and space activities. In 1941, man had the capability to fly 300 mph and to attain altitudes of perhaps 30,000 ft. Today, he orbits the earth at 17,500 mph and in a few years will set foot on the moon and possibly later Mars.” (lrc Release 66-1; Lewis News, 1/23/66, 1-12; upi, Miami Herald, 1/24/66)

January 24: President Johnson’s message to Congress on the FY 1967 budget said in part: "Just over 60 years ago man entered the age of controlled flight. Today, men orbit the earth at speeds measured in thousands of miles an hour. In 1967, less than 6 years after this Nation set the goal of a manned landing on the moon within the present decade, we will begin unmanned test flights of the giant Saturn V rocket and the Apollo spacecraft—the complete space vehicle required for achieving that goal. Later on in the 1960’s, we will undertake the manned lunar mission itself.
"Our many space achievements—both manned and unmanned—have dramatically advanced our scientific understanding and technological capabilities. They have also demonstrated our remarkable progress in the peaceful exploration of space. In 1967, our large space projects will be progressing from the more expensive development phase into operational status, and new projects of equivalent cost will not be started. Accordingly, expenditures of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are estimated to decline by $300 million in 1967 [as opposed to the new authorization requested in the FY 1967-budget]. This level will sustain our progress in space exploration and continue the advancement of science and technology.” (Text, CR, 1/2A/66, 861; Pres. Doc., 1/31/66, 88-9)
•	President Johnson sent FY 1967 budget request to Congress including total
space budget of $6.8 billion. Of this sum, nasa would receive $5,012 billion (nasa had originally requested $5.58 billion); ood, $1.65 billion; aec, $173.7 million; Environmental Science Services Administration, $27 million; and National Science Foundation, $2.8 million.
NASA R&D program was a major area of reduced expenditure with reduction of approximately $186 million (comparedwith FY 1966 appropriation) mostly absorbed by the sharp drop in requirements for Project Gemini. With only three flights remaining to be made in FY 1967, the total budget dropped from $226.6 million in FY 1966 to $40.6 million requested for FY 1967. Sum included $19.1 million for the spacecraft and $8.5 million for mission support. There was also a reduction of some $54 million in lunar and planetary exploration and $12 million in physics and astronomy. Funding for Project Apollo increased slightly—from $2,967 billion in FY 1966 to $2,974 billion, including $1.2 billion for spacecraft (as compared with FY 1966’s $1.17-billion level). $100 million requested for Apollo Applications (Aa) program—once considered the single program with any potential for new major funding—was not approved.
Major portions of the dod space budget would be spent on development of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol)—which would be slowed down with no increase in funds over the $150 million allowed in FY 1966; development and launch operations costs of the Titan III launch vehicle; continuation of the reconnaissance and Vela nuclear detection satellite programs; navigational satellite launches; and initial launch of a satellite by the Defense Communications Satellite System, dod budget also provided for initiation of procurement of the FB-111B aircraft and development of a new short-range air-to-surface missile (Sram).
aec’s budget allotment for space programs included $78 million for Project Rover; $39.5 million for testing of the Nerva engine system; and $8.2 million for testing of the Snap-8 nuclear reactor.
essa’s Tiros weather satellite program would involve expenditures in FY 1967 of $17 million for spacecraft and launchings and approximately $10 million for data acquisition, processing, and archiving.
faa’s FY 1967 budget request for $758 million contained $80 million for six more months of supersonic transport research. (Text; Wash. Post, 1/25/66, A10; Schmeck, NYT, 1/25/66, 1; Av. Wk., 1/31/66, 23, 29, 30; M&R, 1/31/66, 25)
January 24: nasa Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., said at NASA FY 1967 budget briefing that the "extremely stringent budget” ($5,012 billion) approved by President Johnson and the bob was the result of pressing needs of the Vietnam war and the Great Society. Major loser in the nasa budget reduction was the Apollo Applications (Aa) program: "The option to go ahead or not [on the Aa program] will be made in 1968 [budget],” he said. Although nasa had wanted $5.58 billion to carry out its FY 1967 program, Seamans said, the $5,012 billion would make it possible to continue "a good space program” with most of the projects intact. Yet, nasa did "not have the funds we would like to see” for Apollo. He said the approved FY 1967 Apollo budget of $2,974 billion (compared to $2,967 billion in FY 1966) would give the U.S. "a chance of lunar landing in this decade,” but there were no funds "for major difficulties that might occur.” (Transcript)

"Man strives for the most distant objective within reach of his technology.

The Saturn V launch vehicle ... provides the power to place in orbit loads weighing 280,000 pounds. . . . The Apollo spacecraft itself consists of three major systems or modules. The Command Module . . . houses the astronauts during most of their journey.

NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell chaired a special "Space Sciences Report” plenary session which considered priorities in planetary exploration and the interaction of solar wind with the planets. Donald L. Hunter of Kitt Peak National Observatory said Venus exploration was likely to be as interesting as exploration of Mars; high Venusian surface temperature did not rule out possibility of rudimentary life forms, and Venus’ environment might be less hostile than that of Mars. Manned round trips to Mars could be shortened to 450-560 days by a Venus "swingby,” according to Rollin W. Gillespie and Stanley Ross of NASA Office of Manned Space Flight; direct flights would take 800 to 900 days.
Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Deputy Administrator, was principal speaker at the Honors Convocation. He said: "Yesterday, President Johnson presented his budget for the coming fiscal year to the Congress. . . . This year, the process of sorting out priorities and allocating resources has been especially difficult. Abroad, there is the growing commitment to Vietnamese freedom. At home, there is the growing commitment to freedom from poverty, ignorance, ugliness, and unemployment. In addition to these and other commitments, the President’s budget once again reiterates the commitment made in 1958 and repeated year after year: to undertake the exploration of space for the benefit of mankind. Even in a year of extraordinary budget pressures, slightly more than $5 billion for nasa’s part in this enterprise have been requested. . ..
"It is within this framework that the nasa program has been hammered out—not representing the sum of our program demands. However, as we indicated in our budget briefing for the Press this past weekend, we believe we have a balanced program of aeronautics and space research, of science and technology, of large scale manned exploration and unmanned probes and satellites.
"We recognize there is an enormous responsibility attached to the planning, justification, and direction of a sum so large during a period so rich in other needs. . . .
"We have reached a point where the exploration of space is no longer a promise but a hard fact, where scientific data and tested capabilities are in hand instead of in the future.
". . . The program that we have laid out for nasa for the coming year will meet the highest priorities of scientific and technological needs. It will permit flexible evaluation of the next major steps open to us in space. It will maintain the forward momentum that has been built up with energy and care over the past years. It will permit strong competition for those who wish to outstrip us and meaningful cooperation for those who can find communities of interest with us. It will provide an honest and practical balance between the many elements of scientific investigation, technological application and operational experience. It provides a challenge that will require hard work, hard judgment, and careful appraisal at every step of translation from plan into execution. It
does not close to future exploitation the many options that have been built for the nation in the past. Most importantly, it recognizes that true national security is best measured by the useful knowledge in men’s minds and that the great arena of space remains a battleground between the intellect of man and the unknown.”
Tribute to late Dr. Hugh L. Dryden was made at the Honors Convocation by L/G James Doolittle (usafr) : "On the second of December 1965 the world became poorer; our country lost one of its foresighted leaders; aeronautics lost a man who had devoted a major part of his life to its advancement; astronautics lost its great ambassador at home and at large and those fortunate of us—who had been privileged to know and work with him—lost a beloved, revered and respected friend and associate.
"Dr. Hugh Latimer Dryden dedicated his whole life to the service of his fellow man. He was a doer, but a gentle person—a man who strove prodigiously, but instinctively did the kindly thing. He was eager and courageous. He had been critically ill for several years, but he worked hard and effectively up to a few days before his death. . . .
"Hugh Latimer Dryden: engineer, scientist, administrator, public servant, patriot, theologian, realist. With his immediate family and all the nation we, his close friends and associates, mourn his passing. We will long remember him with affection, admiration, respect, and gratitude, for excellence endures.”

January 25-27: House Committee on Science and Astronautics and its panel of advisers on science and technology held 7th annual meeting on "Government, Science, and Public Policy.” In keynote address, Vice President Hubert Humphrey urged closing of "gap between public policy and advancing science and technology . . . when NASA comes to a great university with a grant, it is like planting a field of gold. There is a harvest soon to be reaped, a whole new partnership that creates new wealth, the wealth of brain power, of scientific knowledge, and the end product.”
Guest panelist Lord C. P.

It will take ten years to do all that has to be done. But it will be done.” Lord Snow also made these points: (1) if U.K. could not maintain a high competence in certain
areas of advanced technology, she would lose her talented young men, “slide into somnolence and be no good” to herself, America, or the world; (2) the computer or cybernetic revolution would be the biggest revolution mankind had known; (3) mathematics would "take on a new relevance in all advanced societies.” Noting danger that allocational decisions for research in pure and applied science may involve “too much concentration of power,” Lord Snow added: "The scientific results— not the technological results—. . . of observational and radioastronomy have been greater by an order of magnitude than the scientific results of space exploration.”
In discussion period, Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, Cal Tech president, commented: ". . . though I think I would agree with you generally, I hope you do not minimize the scientific results that have come from ... recent space exploration flights—the understanding of the earth’s magnetosphere, the nature of the solar wind, our closeup views of Venus, the Moon, and Mars have added a very substantial amount to our understanding ... of these objects and of interplanetary space ...” When Lord Snow replied that “space things are interesting, but not at the moment to the same degree”, as radioastronomy, Dr. DuBridge said: “Give us another 20 years.”

By this thorough and repeated testing under every environmental condition that it is possible to simulate, and by understanding and correcting each test failure or performance discrepancy, we believe we can achieve the required high reliability whereby we will be justified in conducting major missions on the second, third or fourth vehicle, rather than on the thirtieth or the hundredth as in Gemini and Mercury.” (Text)

1963, many of China’s leading scientists were 60 or 70 yrs. old and engaged in basic and creative research. The success or failure in bridging the gap between the mass of young scientists and the older scientists would determine whether Communist China would become a scientifically advanced power in the next decade or two, Dr. Cheng said. (Text) January 26: U.K. had made a successful underground test of a major component of its own nuclear warhead for American-supplied Polaris missiles, it was disclosed. Prime Minister Harold Wilson told the House of Commons the test would lead to a considerable savings in costs. An earlier test had been unsuccessful. (NYT, 1/26/66, 39)
January 26-29: American Physical Society met in New York. Dr. Charles H. Townes, Nobel prize-winner and mit provost, said in a dinner speech that the manned lunar landing planned for the end of this decade was both economically and scientifically feasible. "Furthermore,” he continued, "the task probably will be accomplished within time and money limitations set four years ago. These envisage a moon landing by late 1969 at a total cost of about $20 billion.” Townes announced the appointment of "an important ad hoc Science Advisory Committee” aimed at obtaining "the most fruitful relationship between nasa and the scientific community.” Headed by Prof. Norman Ramsey, the new group would "consider many . . . problems, concentrating particularly on how to carry out the most efficient and rich scientific program and what ways will allow the scientific community, including universities, professors, and students to participate most easily and effectively in the interesting possibilities which are now emerging.”
In a panel on the origin and possible death of the universe, P. J. E. Peebles and David Wilkinson of Princeton Univ. and Robert W. Wilson of Bell Telephone Labs, told about evidence indicating that space was permeated by black body radiation. If this were so, it would support the "big bang” theory of the origin of the universe which held that at first, all was a mass of dense energy; then came expansion powered by much of the energy. The original energy would have the properties of the energy emitted by a black body—light, heat, and radio waves proportionate to its temperature. Because no other explanation existed for the energy the Princeton and Bell scientists had detected uniformly distributed over space, and because black body characteristics were so clearcut, they believed confirmation could be achieved within a year.
Yuval Ne’eman of Tel Aviv Univ. proposed a new theory to explain the quasar (quasi-stellar radio source): the force represented by the tendency of the universe to expand had been suppressed in some parts of the universe; thus, these areas were highly dense. But because this tendency is not suppressed under all conditions, it sometimes bursts forth and matter tears free of the intense gravitational attractions. When this happens, enormous amounts of matter and energy are emitted and observers on earth detect the event as a quasar.
Scientists in a panel discussion on scientific data said the task of coping with the scientific information explosion should not become exclusively a Government responsibility. Discussion was based on December 1965 report of Federal Council for Science and Technology recommending that the Government—with participation of private groups—establish a national document handling system to help keep scientists abreast of new knowledge.
In a discussion of planetary exploration, Cal Tech Prof. Robert B.
Leighton, scientist in charge of the televising by mariner iv of Mars (July 14, 1965), said there was still hope the TV pictures would yield information about Mars’ canals: "When we know more nearly where the camera was pointed—because it is not known very clearly now ... we . may be able to say that this picture was taken at a place very near where a canal goes across.” Leighton said he had agreed to collaborate with Prof. Gordon J. F. MacDonald of ucla on a television experiment for the Mariner spacecraft scheduled to fly by Venus in 1967. (Texts; Wash. Eve. Star, 1/27/66, A3; Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 1/28/66, A4; Weil, Wash.

•	President Johnson transmitted his annual Report to the Congress on
United States Aeronautics and Space Activities, calling 1965 “the most successful year in our history.” He said in the transmittal letter: "As our space program continues, the impact of its developments on everyday life becomes daily more evident. It continues to stimulate our education, improve our material well being, and broaden the horizons of knowledge. It is also a powerful force for peace.” He cited U.S. accomplishments in the Gemini, Ranger, Mariner, and Early Bird programs. "Research and development in our space program continued to speed progress in medicine, in weather prediction, in electronics—and, indeed, in virtually every aspect of American science and technology.” Among chief aeronautical developments report cited "design refinement and wind-tunnel testing” of Sst and decision to build C-5A jet transport. Among successful U.S. launches during 1965, non had 67 satellites, 34 of which were unidentified. Military space programs were discussed, including Project West Ford; Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol); Initial Defense Communications Satellite Project; and the geodetic Secor satellites. Research was under way on the best means of determining physical characteristics of "uncooperating objects in earth orbit” through observation by ground-based radar. The section on aec said that a third pair of Vela radiation-detection satellites launched in July 1965 was watching for nuclear explosions in space and measuring x-ray emissions from the sun.

During January: Eulogies for the late Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator, and the late Dr. W. Randolph Lovelace II, nasa Director of Space Medicine, appeared in Air Force and Space Digest:
Walter T. Bonney said of Dr. Dryden: "Hugh Dryden was a deeply religious man. He held that man’s life at its fullest is a trinity of activity, physical, mental, and spiritual. Throughout his life he preached the compatibility of religion and science, and he lived what he preached. No less, he was a realist; and so, as in 1954, he would often remind his listeners that: 'I am not one of those few who believe that we can abolish the use of force in the world. As a nation we find it necessary to build great military power. I am confident that such strength is a greater contribution to the peace of the world ... than military weakness.’
"In 1947, he was called to direct the work of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. His tasks were enormously difficult—radically new and expensive research facilities had to be provided, but even more important, learning the nature of the intricate problems of flight in the new speed ranges and methods for their solution demanded new concepts of team activity and functional coordination. His leadership, disarmingly light and unobtrusive, was amazingly perceptive and effective. Facilities were obtained and changes were made; the period 1947-58 became what might be truly called naca’s golden age.
"With establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (of which naca was the nucleus), he undertook the role of scientific leader, reporting to the Administrator, and made of it a position of paramount influence. He rejoiced in the US policy that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes and worked to promote international space cooperation; but no less, he saw in US exploration of space an activity essential to the strength and security of the nation. As perhaps never before, his great wisdom and his unexcelled mastery of the art of the possible were in those later years valued and used to their fullest.”
Editor John Loosbrock said of Dr. Lovelace: "In widening circles, the full import of Randy’s untimely death becomes apparent. The Air Force Association and the Aerospace Education Foundation have lost a distinguished leader. The medical profession is poorer for the passing of a Erilliant surgeon, an imaginative ^researcher. The United States Air Force will miss his sound advice and pioneering efforts in the special kind of medical knowledge that is required for those who fly—in air and in space. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration must find new leadership for its space medical effort. The entire nation and the world itself will find that Randy Lovelace’s death leaves a large and well-nigh unfillable niche.” (AF/SD, 1/66)
During January: Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, Special Assistant to nasa Administrator, paid tribute to the late Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, in Applied Mechanics Reviews on Dr. Dryden’s scientific and engineering accomplishments. Dr. Bisplinghoff noted that the naca, under Dr. Dryden’s leadership, "produced a vast body of new knowledge which made possible routine supersonic flight and laid much of the ground for space flight that was to come. We discern here, perhaps as much as any other place, the impact of Dryden’s leadership on the nation’s destiny. The development of high-speed wind-tunnel facilities and a companion competence for theoretical research within the naca contributed, in the opinion of the author, more than any other single factor to the leadership of the United States in supersonic flight. . . .” (AMR, 1/66, 1-5)

He said: ."It was a splendid arrangement. The glamor of a Federal space center would grease the way for urban renewal which, realistically, didn’t otherwise stand a chance of tearing up this thriving industrial area. NASA had captured a prize piece of real estate at a bargain-basement price— roughly $4 million—thanks to the fact that urban renewal would pay most of the 'real’ cost of the land and would take on the expense and dirty work of removing the occupants. And the Cambridge-Boston area was going to have all that money spent there.

During January: Dr. Donald F. Hornig, Director of Office of Science and Technology, said in International Science and Technology: "... a technological society has to have first-rate research in progress—in some cases for immediate application and in other cases simply because we realize more and more that we have to depend on how much we know and understand in order to build a new society ... So research, as research, is an important goal, and in accomplishing it we end up supporting two-thirds of all the research going on in the graduate schools of the country. . . . We’re supporting some 26,000 students a year, indirectly, through research grants. And now through direct federal grants and fellowships we’re supporting a little more than that many again.

Renzo di Carrobio, addressing members of "Britain in Europe” committee in London, contrasted "present hesitancy” on space programs in Europe with positive U.S. position. Americans, Carrobio said, were aware of economic benefits from technological applications of space research and were "making great efforts to ensure that the spin-off from their heavy investment in space research is put to good use in the industrial sector.” He noted that U.S. $5-billion space budget meant $26 per capita annual expenditure, while Europe spent $200 million annually or $1.15 per person.

February 3: essa i (Tiros OT-3), first meteorological satellite in Tiros Operational Satellite (Tos) series, was launched from etr for Environmental Science Services Administration (essa) by NASA with three-stage Thor-Delta booster into nearly polar, sun-synchronous orbit to provide cloud coverage of entire sunlit portion of the earth at least once daily. Before achieving orbit, spacecraft performed three precise "dogleg” maneuvers initiated by airborne autopilot system, injecting it into orbit: apogee, 523 mi. (842 km.); perigee, 433 mi. (697 km.); period, 100 min.; inclination, 91.9°. During first orbit, essa i was spin-stabilized at 10 rpm with spin axis in plane of orbit. Entering second orbit, spacecraft responded to ground control command to begin turning on its side into cartwheel position. Maneuver was expected to be completed 24 hrs. after launch; television cameras would be turned on 36 hrs. after launch. Cartwheel shaped, essa i contained two 1'2-in. vidicon cameras mounted 180° apart on each side so they could view earth every six seconds. Camera system could send pictures directly to command and data acquisition stations at NASA Wallops Station and Gilmore Creek, Alaska, or store photos on its tape recorder for readout when satellite passed within 1,500-mi. radius of a ground station.
essa I (Environmental Survey Satellite No. 1) was 11th successful Tiros (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) to be launched by NASA in 11 attempts. It was first of two Tos operational meteorological satellites planned and financed by essa to provide daily cloud-cover pictures to ground stations on a global basis, essa (at that time U.S. Weather Bureau) had also funded tiros x (OT-1), launched by NASA July 2, 1965.

•	First soft-landing on moon was made by U.S.S.R. when luna ix spacecraft
softlanded an instrument package near Ocean of Storms west of the Reiner and Marius craters. Instrument package began relaying telemetric signals to earth immediately and Tass said "information received from the station is being processed and studied.”
Landing sequence, as later described by Tass, began 8,300 km. (5,155
mi.) above moon approximately one hour before touchdown when luna ix was oriented vertically to the moon. At 77-km. (47-mi.) altitude, 48 sec. before touchdown, radar system aimed at lunar surface turned on the retrorocket and shock-absorbing system was prepared. Less than one second before impact, after spacecraft had been slowed to less than 10 mph, instrument capsule was ejected. Rocket crashed and 4 min. 10 sec. after instrument capsule had landed, its petal-like covering and antennas opened and radio transmissions began.
Jodrell Bank Experimental Station announced luna ix had transmitted facsimile pictures of the moon from the time it landed at 1:45 p.m. est until 2:05 p.m. est, gone off the air, and then resumed signals shortly after 9:00 p.m. est. Soviet spokesman declined to confirm report. British scientists were unable to translate signals into pictures but recorded them on magnetic tapes.
U.S.S.R.’s four previous attempts to softland spacecraft on the moon had failed: luna v, launched May 9, 1965; luna vi, launched June 8, 1965; luna vii, launched Oct. 4, 1965; and luna viii, launched Dec. 3, 1965.

February 4: Soviet officials acknowledged that luna ix photos were being received in U.S.S.R. and said first luna ix photo would appear in Feb. 5 edition of Izvestia. (Wash. Post, 2/5/66, A6)
•	Two photographs of the moon produced at Jodrell Bank Experimental
Station by feeding radio transmissions from luna ix into newspaper telephoto machine were shown on British television. Each picture took eight minutes to receive and was recorded at 100 lines to one inch for finished 10- by 11-in. photo. Sir Bernard Lovell, station director, said in a television interview that photos "seem to destroy the theory that the moon’s surface is covered with dust several feet thick. There may be a few inches of dust, but the pictures tend to confirm the view of the moon’s surface as hard, spongelike pumice stone substance.
"It would be perfectly satisfactory for landing not only heavy vehicles but also men.”
Lovell pointed out rock-like pinnacles estimated to be 10- to 20-ft. tall; small stones, some less than one inch in diameter; the curved horizon of the moon; and sharp shadows which indicated the sun was casting the shadow. He emphasized, however, necessity of knowing the proper scale before photos could be meaningfully interpreted. Lovell said luna ix had landed in a location which would receive sunhght for 14 days, thereby permitting solar power to replenish its batteries. (Wash.

•	U.S. space officials did not feel that luna ix’s successful soft-landing on
the moon indicated U.S. was behind U.S.S.R. in the "moon race,” reported John Wilford in the New York Times. Vice President Humphrey, nasc Chairman, told Wilford in an interview that "so many systems and programs are involved that it is very difficult to say who’s ahead and who’s behind.” Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Deputy Administrator, admired the Soviets’ "solid, aggressive and expanding” space program
and conceded that although U.S. program was broader-based "the Russians are awfully good at picking goals and going after them.” Wilford said U.S. space officials were unwilling to speculate on who would make first manned lunar landing, but foresaw no significant changes in U.S. program because of luna ix’s success. Dr. Seamans said Surveyor project would not be curtailed and could not be speeded up: "We’ve got to gather our own data because we can’t count on the Russians to release their own data. Besides, we want to land in other places on the moon. Hopefully, we can exchange data with the Russians.” (Wilford, NYT, 2/5/66, 11)
February 4: International scientific community commented on luna ix’s soft-landing on the moon. Dr. William Pickering, Director of jpl, offered congratulations and said: "The difficulty of the task is attested to by the number of previous attempts to accomplish a soft landing on the moon. The success of this mission has already added to our knowledge of the lunar surface. We now await with interest the scientific data which will be received in the next few days.” Heinz Kaminski, chief of Bochum Observatory, West Germany: "American space flight technology is on a high level of perfection which the Russians just can’t match.” Dr. L. R. Shepherd, president of British Interplanetary Society: "[Soft-landing on the moon is] much more difficult than the orbit rendezvous achieved by the Americans.” Dr. Shotaro Miyamoto, chief of Kyoto Univ. astronomical observatory, Japan: "Soviet landing means men and materials will now be sent to the moon and its development accelerated.” (NYT, 2/5/66, 11; 2/6/66, Ell)
• International press commented on luna ix’s soft-landing on the moon. New York Times: "Two facts indicate the magnitude of the advance that has now been made. One is the known failure of four earlier Soviet rockets to make the soft landing finally achieved by Luna 9. The second is the unhappy history of efforts in this country to build the Surveyor vehicle, which is intended to perform moon reconnaissance of the type in which the Soviet ship is pioneering. The Surveyor project is currently far behind schedule. The first flight is not planned until later this year, and it is impossible even to forecast when a Surveyor will duplicate the soft landing of Luna 9.
"The whole process demonstrates again the wastefulness of the Soviet-American moon race. Were the United States and Russia cooperating fully, rather than competing, the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on Surveyor would have been applied to progress in fields still inadequately explored by either country.”
Yomiuri Shimbun, Tokyo: "It is possible to say that the Soviet Union is considerably ahead of the U.S. in the moon development program. It is regrettable that the two nations have failed to exchange information and technology for the development of outer space.”
La Nazione, Florence: "If the Russians already know how to land on the moon, they still don’t know how to effect a 'rendezvous’ in orbit. The inverse holds, naturally, for the Americans. This means that both are still faced by formidable problems and that the great contest is still open.”
Times of India, Bombay: "At this rate it is not unreasonable to presume that a Russian-manned probe will land on the moon and return in about a year from now, beating the Americans to it by about three years.” (NYT, 2/6/66, Ell)

February 5: U.S.S.R. released luna ix’s photographs of the moon for first time and criticized distortion of photos publicized by Jodrell Bank Experimental Station. Photos, shown on an eight-minute television program, were analyzed by scientists Vladimir Yurovsky, Yuri Mbelou-son, and Ivan Koval. Moon’s surface appeared very uneven with many small depressions and mounds. Surface near the station had not sunk into the soil to any substantial degree. No visible traces of dust were evident. At bottom of first picture, part of spacecraft, including antenna and two-faced mirror which reflected the lunar surface, could be seen. A small stone believed about 6XA ft. from the craft could have been a meteorite or could have fallen from a hill, in which case "we could presume there are some processes of movement on the moon’s surface,” scientists concluded.
Tass announced details of luna ix’s structure and flight: 3,482.6-lb. spacecraft was an airtight package carrying radio system, program-timer, thermal-regulation system, power-supply sources, and television system ensuring 360° view of the landscape. Antennas mounted on outside of craft were set to open automatically after it had settled on lunar surface. Complete with shock-absorbing system and metal screens shaped like petals to protect it during touchdown, 220-lb. instrumented payload detached itself from engine immediately before landing, and two units landed at some distance from each other.
Anatoli A. Blagonravov, chairman of the Soviet Commission for Exploration and Use of Outer Space, was critical of Jodrell Bank’s publication of luna ix photos and said that Jodrell Bank lacked the correct vertical and horizontal scales: "The horizontal scale of the British photographs had been shrunk by approximately 2.5 times.”
Photos released by Moscow, vivid in detail and contrast, showed a landscape less pinnacled and strange than that in British versions. (Sullivan, NYT, 2/6/66, 76; Grose, NYT, 2/6/66, 1, 76; AP, Wash. Eve. Star, 2/6/66, A14)

February 6: “The lunar research program by means of Luna 9 has been fulfilled and successfully concluded,” Tass reported after luna ix had completed 48 hrs. of active life transmitting a total of 10 panoramic photographs of lunar surface. Several hours after the announcement, Jodrell Bank Experimental Station reported it had received 2H more photos of poor quality.
Third picture transmitted by luna ix’s instrument package Feb. 4 was shown on Moscow television. During transmission, camera was inclined toward horizon and sun was to the east. Part of spacecraft was visible in the lower left-hand corner of the picture and another part in the lower light, but out of focus because of short distance from camera lens. Soviet astronomer Nikolay Barabashov told Tass photographs confirmed his theory that moon’s surface was “highly pitted, porous and probably covered with numerous rocks and fragments.” luna ix “has proved beyond doubt that the upper layer of lunar soil is a spongelike rough-textured mass scattered with individual sharp-edged fragments of various sizes.” (NYT, 2/7/66, 1, 15; AP, Wash.

February 9: nasa launched 210-lb. Reentry E payload by Scout booster from NASA Wallops Station to evaluate char integrity of low-density phenolic nylon heat-shield material and test its effectiveness in withstanding actual reentry conditions. In addition to four stages of Scout launch vehicle, 17-in. spherical rocket was attached to instrumented payload as velocity package, First two Scout stages lofted payload to 54-mi. (87km.) altitude. Remainder of vehicle coasted upward to 110-mi. (177-km.) altitude and at peak of trajectory, during 3rd-stage burn, guidance system began positioning vehicle for desired reentry angle. Fourth stage fired during descent, and then velocity package motor ignited, driving reentry payload to a velocity of more than 18,000 mph through earth’s atmos-sphere.

•	Mstislav Keldysh, president of Soviet Academy of Sciences; Alexander
Lebedinsky, professor; and Alexander Vinogradov, geochemist, held 2:A-hr. televised press conference in Moscow on the luna ix mission. Keldysh said U.S.S.R. had mastered the soft-landing technique and was planning more soft-landing missions in 1966 to obtain information on physical conditions on the moon, composition of lunar rock, and variations in lunar temperature. He said the next major challenge would be designing a spacecraft capable of returning men to earth from the moon and called for U.S. "cooperation not competition” in a program for manned lunar landing, luna ix’s mission was "only to photograph the surface of the moon and measure cosmic radiation,” Keldysh said. The full panorama of the lunar surface included 6,000 lines and was transmitted to earth in 100 min. Spacecraft contained no solar batteries.
Lebedinsky revealed that luna ix had "shifted between the second and third transmissions of the panorama, and as a result, the inclination of the phototelevision camera changed several degrees, while the camera itself shifted its position several centimeters.” Keldysh added: "It may be that the station landed on an unstable small stone, or perhaps the ground settled slightly. Such a very small deformation could occur because of temperature changes on the moon or a certain mechanical
impact by the station itself.” He expressed confidence that the lunar surface could support manned spacecraft.

•	nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications
Edgar M. Cortright, testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications, stressed importance of selectivity in planning space science program: "We have been looking at Apollo applications for some time to identify those areas of scientific activity where the man can be a real asset to the experiment, and the areas that interest us most are astronomy; natural resources, which is looking down at the Earth with various types of detectors; biology, which is concerned with long-duration weightless flight, from both a fundamental biological point of view and in preparation for longer flights; and, of course, continued lunar exploration.
"... man is not an asset in space science experiments in all cases. You have to be extremely selective to find those cases where he will be an asset, and they do exist. We think that astronomy in the seventies is one such area; also biology, Earth resources, and continued lunar exploration. But in the particles and fields work it is unlikely that man will be an asset, and it is unlikely that he will play the major role in applications where what we really want is long lifetime.” (NASA Auth.

Mueller told the Business Council in Washington, D.C., that "so far as overall manned space flight manpower is concerned, we have passed our peak” in engineering, we’re "reaching our peak in manufacturing,” and we’re "at our peak in total manpower costs.” He added: "One of the anomalies of the space program is that we must begin to 'go out of business’ before we fly our first operational vehicle. ... By the time manned flights begin, the employment level will be quite low in comparison with the peak, which occurred in 1965. . . .”
Commenting on post-Apollo plans, he said: "The budget for the coming fiscal year permits nasa to hold open the option for a program to procure additional flight vehicles beyond those now programmed, so as to employ the Apollo hardware and capabilities at least through 1971. If we do not exercise this option, in the decision for the [FY] 1968 budget we will have to begin a phase down of the manned space flight activities and the 'mothballing’ of some of our facilities.” (Text)
•	AEC Chairman Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg predicted at Univ. of Texas lecture
that if man decided to colonize the moon or planets, he would need
nuclear energy to make the environments habitable for human beings and large nuclear reactors to provide "planet conditioning”—an outer space version of air conditioning. In addition, reactors could furnish power "to extract water from the rock, to help produce synthetic food and to extract minerals and other materials from the surface.” Dr. Seaborg said he foresaw in the more immediate future the use of nuclear power plants on manned orbiting laboratories: "... it is desirable to operate these stations at the relatively low altitudes of between 100 and 200 nautical miles. For these low orbits the smaller exposed area of nuclear power systems results in greater reductions in the atmospheric drag—and in the pounds of propellant required to keep the station in its assigned orbit. An unmanned scientific or defense system which has to operate close to the Earth will similarly have the advantage of low atmospheric drag if nuclear power systems are used.” (Text; AEC Release S-6-66)

•	Use of personal radar units by astronauts to counteract optical illusions
which they might encounter while assembling a space station or exploring the moon was recommended by Cambridge Univ. Prof. Richard L. Gregory, author of Eye and Brain: The Psychology of Seeing, in a New York press interview. Gregory believed astronauts might experience spatial distortion when seeing spacecraft’s structural elements gleaming luminously in sunlight or sharply etched against a jet black background. In addition, he thought they might experience reversed depth perception which would cause distorted images. Gregory recommended aiding astronauts with tones, heard through earphones, of a variable pitch which would be determined by a beam from radar unit each man would wear. Variations in pitch would indicate distance to different objects and astronaut’s rate of approach or retreat from them. Gregory was conducting his research at New York Univ. on a senior foreign scientist fellowship financed in part by nasa. (Osmundsen, NYT,	31; Houston

February 22-23: American Astronautical Society met in San Diego.
Reconnaissance satellites, adapted for peaceful observations of earth’s surface, would bring revolutionary scientific and economic advances, Willis B. Foster, Director of Manned Space Science in NASA’s Office of Space Science and Applications, predicted: "Remote sensing from space has unique capabilities, particularly in the opportunity it provides for repetitive synoptic coverage of the earth’s surface. . . . Spaceborne sensors will add to the knowledge of the figure of the earth, its mass distribution, and its magnetic and gravity fields. Movement of glaciers, growth of deltas, growth of crops, and even growth of populations can all be followed with this type of survey.” (Text)
Austin M. Stanton, president and board chairman of Varo, Inc., said features of space such as airlessness, weightlessness, extreme temperature, and radiation could be "exploited as a completely new realm” for manufacturing. He said the earth might ultimately be encircled by a "vast doughnut-like ring 150,000 miles in circumference,” of articulated orbiting manufacturing facilities: "As a businessman, I propose that the time is ripe for a profitable industrial venture in space. ... It will not be difficult to persuade investors to venture into buying stock in the new companies for three reasons: the predictions of the early advocates of astronautics have been fulfilled; the efforts of space agencies have been spectacularly successful; and . . . the communications satellite venture seems sound.” (Hill, NYT, 2/27/66, 60)
The massive investment in technology and manpower created by space programs could be used to handle pressing problems associated with anticipated population growth on earth, suggested Dr. Peter A. Castruccio, director of IBM’s advanced space programs. Satellites could survey earth from space, pinpoint tillable land and examine staple crops using infrared techniques to detect diseases invisible to the naked eye. Seas could be mapped, isolating concentrations of fish and edible seaweed, and growing consumption of water offset by
using satellites to map snow fields and glaciers. Underground rivers could be detected from space by measuring the tiny difference in soil temperatures above them; such streams were estimated to have 3,000 times the water present in all known rivers. Other fields, such as weather control and geological survey searches for fuel and minerals, could also be handled from space. (M&R, 2/28/66, 9, 12)
"The ultimate goal of weather modification and control may be realized only if man himself is placed in a Space Meteorological Lab,” suggested Sidney Sternberg, vice president and general manager of Electro-Optical Systems, Inc. He said the "ability and bandwidth of transfer of information between experiments and experimenter could not be duplicated by unmanned observations.” (M&R, 2/28/66, 12)
February 23: Second 260-in.-dia. solid-propellant rocket motor (SL-2), Nation’s largest, was successfully test-fired for nasa in Dade County, Fla., by Aerojet-General Corp. Fueled with polybutadiene, aluminum and ammonium-perchlorate and fired nose down in a 150-ft.-deep pit, motor developed within 1% of the predicted 3.5-million lbs. thrust and burned for almost precisely the planned 126 sec. Test showed repeatability of the firing, proved that manufacturing techniques were reliable, and demonstrated that the motors could be produced at a predictable cost. First 260-in. motor (SL-1) was successfully fired for two minutes Sept. 25, 1965, producing 3.6-million lbs. thrust. Strength of the maraging steel motor case, structural integrity of the cast propellant, insulation, and the ablative nozzle were tested.

The experiments have shown that rapid starts and restarts can be made and that operation is stable over a wide range of conditions.
"On February 3, 1966, we made the first power run with a complete nuclear rocket engine system. Although the major components were spread out and connected in a 'breadboard’ fashion, the system started and operated as a unit with no external power. On February 11, the system was operated again.

In connection with possible
further use of Apollo/Saturn V hardware beyond the lunar landing mission, Dr. Mueller stressed necessity for early decisions on the FY 1968 budget. Industrial research, development, and manufacturing employment had already reached its peak and, ironically, would begin to decline sharply before the first manned flights with Apollo/Saturn hardware. Facilities now becoming operational would be scheduled for "mothballing” within two years if no further use were planned for capability beyond the lunar landing, Dr. Mueller said. (NASA Auth.

February 24: nasa’s lunar and planetary programs were discussed by NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Edgar M. Cortright, testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications: "It is important to note that the Mariner IV photographs do not determine whether life exists on Mars. Even before the flight of Mariner IV, it was known that pictures taken at this resolution could not give any direct evidence of life forms. . . .
"We propose to continue the exploration of Venus and Mars begun so well with Mariners II and IV, respectively, by utilizing for the 1967 Venus opportunity an appropriate modification of the spare spacecraft from the Mariner IV program. This will be launched on an Atlas-Agena vehicle.”
Cortright presented prepared statement by Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell summarizing comsat and sounding rocket launches: "The first launching by nasa of a satellite for the Corporation [ComSatCorp] took place on April 6, 1965, when the Early Bird satellite was placed in orbit using a thrust-augmented Delta launch vehicle. The launching was carried out under an agreement between Comsat and NASA, signed in December 1964, which detailed the services to be performed by NASA, financial arrangements, etc. . . .
"Although the original agreement gave Comsat options for as many as seven additional launchings through March 1967, none of these options has been exercised. In the meantime, Comsat has inaugurated the HS-303A program, and has advised NASA that it will require two or three HS-303A launchings in 1966, beginning in August. The HS-303A is larger and heavier than Early Bird, and will need the capabilities of the thrust-augmented improved Delta launch vehicle. Otherwise, launch services are expected to be similar to those provided in support of the Early Bird.
"The Corporation is now negotiating for development and procurement of spacecraft for the eventual global system. These spacecraft are expected to be deployed beginning in 1968.”
Referring to the NASA sounding rocket program, Dr. Newell said: "Since 1959 to the present NASA has launched 668 sounding rockets for scientific investigations in space and 516 of these were for investigations in the areas of physics and astronomy.” He mentioned as significant the International Quiet Sun Year (iqsy) Mobile Launch Expedition carried out in spring 1965 using an aircraft carrier as a launching platform: rockets carrying instrumented payloads were launched off west coast of South America from 5° north latitude to 60° south latitude with the greatest concentration of flights at the geomagnetic equator near Lima, Peru. 45 Nike-Cajun/Nike-Apache rockets and 32 single-stage Areas

The proposal was accepted. . . . Technical approval of general plans is through the nasa oart Office and the afsc RTD Office and generation and coordination of program details are developed through appointed technical groups from the NASA and Air Force research centers. To date this coordination activity has been very effective. ...”
As major elements of nasa’s 1967 aeronautics program, Harper listed: (1) a continuing effort in advanced research; (2) major effort in support of Sst with emphasis on flight operations and advanced propulsion; (3) a substantial increase in research in propulsion systems appropriate to the whole speed range, from V/Stol to hypersonic speeds with special attention directed to the noise problem and supported by two new facilities; (4) a substantially increased effort in V/Stol research supported by construction of the first research facility to be built expressly for conducting research on problems unique to V/Stol aircraft.

• NASA Administrator James E. Webb, testifying before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences as it began hearings on NASA’s FY 1967 budget authorization, said U.S.S.R. would become unchallenged leader in space exploration unless U.S. soon decided to support post-Apollo missions. Webb reviewed U.S.S.R.’s very active year in space and said: "More important to us than any other indication from Soviet space activity is the clear commitment to a long-term effort. The fact that they are making such a commitment shows the importance they attach to advancing their capabilities in space. Unless we soon decide to follow through with a strong program in the years after we have achieved a manned lunar landing, we cannot avoid a gap in our flight schedule while they forge ahead as the unchallenged contestant in the field.”
Webb noted FY 1967 budget for NASA reflected a Presidential decision "to hold open for another year decisions which cannot be delayed beyond the period of the FY 1968 budget.” He added: "The programs we are now carrying out so successfully, the new knowledge we are acquiring so rapidly, the ending of the period of uncertainty as to what both Russian Cosmonauts and American Astronauts can achieve in space, and the growing utilization of the long term values that our investments have created in reliable launch vehicles, spacecraft, and assembly test and launch complexes, all point toward decisions to use rather than lose the values we have worked so hard and spent so much to create. And so I believe that our presentation of this 1967 Budget marks not just assertion to you that we have built well as we have created a foundation for space power, but also marks the beginning of a momentous era in which we must decide how we will use this power in future years.”
He assessed the national space program: ". . . we have demonstrated that we can do the tasks we set out to do. An important value of the
space program is this demonstration of national capability in science and technology. That we have this capability is no longer a matter of opinion but a demonstrated fact that is clear to all who concern themselves with the power nations can and do develop for many purposes from the mastery of a new environment or a new technology. We have put it on view for all the world to see. The world knows today that the United States can digest the space-related problems of long lead-times, can hold its position in a demanding competition, and can forge ahead simultaneously in both aeronautics and space and in those advanced technologies of which space is the leading symbol.” (NASA Audi.

"The need to continue those important projects in space sciences and space applications that are already underway and that have already made such valuable contributions to our fundamental understanding of the universe and to the use of space systems for human benefit.
"The need to maintain the flow of advanced research and technology effort that is at the heart of the Nation’s ability to undertake future projects in aeronautics and space explorations.

He described research in behavioral biology, outlining prospective experiment to determine whether for pocket mice in earth orbit "circadian rhythm of either temperature or locomotion changes when all geophysical variables other than light and temperature are either removed or sensed by the animals with a period of about 90 minutes (orbital period) instead of 24 hours.”
By the end of FY 1966, nasa’s sustaining university program would be supporting 64 projects at 54 institutions throughout U.S., Dr. Newell testified. In FY 1967 it would support approximately 70 projects at 60 universities at a cost of $12 million. It was expected that 3,681 students would be in the predoctoral training element of the program by September 1966 and the number of participating universities would be 152. (NASA Auth.

February 28: Gemini Astronauts Charles A. Bassett II and Elliot M. See, Jr., were killed when their T-38 aircraft overran St. Louis Municipal Airport in rain and fog and crashed into the McDonnell Aircraft Corp. building which housed Gemini 9 and 10 spacecraft. The jet, cleared for an instrument landing, was left of center in its approach to the runway when it turned toward the McDonnell complex 1,000 ft. from instrumented landing strip. It struck the roof of Building 101, bounced into an adjacent courtyard, and exploded. Several McDonnell employees in Building 101 were treated for minor injuries. See and Bassett, enroute to McDonnell for two weeks training in space simulator, were followed later by Gemini IX backup crew Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene A. Cernan, who landed safely, nasa Hq. officials announced that the backup crew would fly the Gemini IX mission on schedule. (Wagner, Wash. Post, 3/1/66, Al, A4)
•	Discussing the Apollo/Saturn IB program’s future, Dr. Joseph Shea,
director of Apollo spacecraft development at msc, told Missiles and Rockets that the hoped-for early end of the program (after a total of seven flights, including four manned missions) would depend on availability of the Saturn V booster, as well as success of Saturn IB missions: "We plan to end the series at Apollo-207 if the Saturn V is available on schedule. If not, we will probably continue with Saturn IB flights for the Apollo-208 and 209 missions.” (Taylor, M&R, 2/28/66, 17)
•	Joint Chiefs of Staff believed U.S.S.R. was accomplishing much more in
advanced weaponry than Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara was giving them credit for, reported Aviation Week. Gen. John P. McConnell, usaf Chief of Staff, was said to be especially concerned about Soviet developments in antimissile missiles and their radars, maneuverable warheads for icbms, military space systems, and advanced aircraft. During hearings on the FY 1966 budget, General McConnell had said the decision on whether to proceed with full-scale development of the advanced manned strategic aircraft (Amsa) should be made in FY 1967. Aviation Week pointed out McNamara did not make that decision in the the FY 1967 budget and dropped Amsa one category—from engineering development to advanced development. Also, in a posture statement before the Senate Armed Services Committee’s Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, McNamara appeared to contradict Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Harold Brown’s view that the FB-111 was only a stop-gap bomber until Amsa was approved. Comparison of Boeing B-52C through F models, McNamara reportedly said, showed "the FB-111 is not an interim aircraft but is, indeed, a truly effective strategic bomber.” (Wilson, Av.

Murray, Cal Tech Associate Professor of Planetary Science, and Merton
E.	Davies, rand Corp., said of nasa’s mariner iv July 14, 1965, flyby: "The American scientific community should, and evidently does, feel proud and gratified that the Mariner mission to Mars, through successful utilization of national resources, not only accomplished a remarkable technological feat but also discovered extraordinary new facts ... beyond the reach of earth-based instruments.” Authors termed "disappointing” U.S. decisions to terminate Mariner program, fly extra Mariner C spacecraft to Venus in 1967, drop plans for 1971 Voyager launch, and "fill the gap” with an abbreviated 1969 Atlas-Centaur program. U.S.S.R., they noted, had spent "between five and ten times as much on flight programs for planetary exploration” as U.S. and, in spite of "six consecutive failures in their efforts to explore Mars,” may have developed a reliable 2,000-lb. spacecraft for Mars flyby. Authors predicted U.S.S.R. would launch two Zond spacecraft in December 1966: "It will be surprising to us if at least one . . . does not reach the planet and return new facts about it.” They suggested 1971 as earliest likely date for Soviet landing of survivable payload on Martian surface and concluded that by 1967 "the U.S. will be ready to make an enduring national commitment to the exploration of the planets, and be ready to demonstrate intellectual appreciation of discovery as well as enthusiasm for technological achievement.” (Science, 2/25/66, 945-54)

During February: Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, Director of msfc Research Projects Laboratory, summarized progress in development of electric propulsion in Astronautics & Aeronautics: "The first laboratory experiments with electrostatic thrustors began in 1958. In the early thrustor models, power efficiencies and propellant-utilization efficiencies were 20-30%; lifetimes did not exceed a few hours; ion-current densities were less than 1 milliamp/cm2; the problem of beam neutralization was unsolved— was not even well understood. Mission applications seemed far in the future. Today, only seven years later, electrostatic thrustors are very close to flight readiness. Two systems, the ion-bombardment system and the surface-ionization system, have reached power efficiencies and propellant efficiencies above 90%; they produce ion currents of about 20 milliamp/cm2. Beam neutralization has proven in the laboratory as well as in actual space tests, and engine lifetimes of several-thousand hours have been demonstrated. With a few more years of refinement and quality engineering, these ion thrustors will be ready for extended missions into interplanetary space. . . .” (A&A, 2/66, 71-2)

March 1966
March 1: U.S.S.R. venus in spacecraft "reached” the surface of Venus at 1:56 a.m. est to become man’s first space probe to land on another planet, Tass announced. Observers believed the 2,116-lb. spacecraft, launched Nov. 16, 1965, had crash-landed. "Regular radio communications” had been maintained with venus iii throughout the flight but were lost as the probe approached the planet; no telemetric data were received in final moments before impact. Announcement said companion spacecraft venus ii, launched Nov. 12, 1965, had passed within 14,900 mi. of Venus Feb. 27, and was continuing in solar orbit. (Later, on March 5, U.S.S.R. revealed that communications with venus ii were lost as the spacecraft approached Venus.) 2,123-lb. venus ii had flown its entire course without a corrective maneuver "insured only by its correct launching on an interplanetary trajectory,” but the course of venus ill had been adjusted in Dec. 27, 1965, midcourse maneuver to make possible precise rendezvous with planet. "The experiment conducted through the work of the automatic stations Venus 2 and 3 allowed the solution of a number of absolutely new tasks of interplanetary flights and the obtaining of new scientific data,” Tass said. Man’s closest previous contact with Venus had occurred Dec. 14, 1962, when NASA’s mariner ii (launched Aug. 27, 1962) had passed 21,648 mi. from its surface and had relayed back scientific data. The brief Tass statement said venus in carried pennant bearing Soviet coat of arms to the Venusian surface. Further details of the spacecraft’s instrumentation were to be revealed later [see March 5].
Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, called the landing "a vivid technical feat” but regretted that "the Russians should have endangered the future biological assessment of Venus by contaminating the planet.” (Pravda, 3/2/66, 1, 4; Grose, NYT, 3/2/66, 1; Wash.

Science and Applications, testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Sciences and Applications in support of nasa’s FY 1967 authorization, discussed the merits of the Apollo and Surveyor programs: "The scientific advantages of having Surveyors in the program along with Apollo is the ability to
sample more sites and to determine what areas of the moon are worth visiting by man, for example, in addition to going to sites that man is not likely to for the next decade or more—up near the poles and certain of the mountain regions.
"We would like to help develop this total strategy of exploration of the Moon in a sensible way. We think automated equipment continues to have a role to play. . . .
"I think there is nothing we can fly on Surveyor that would improve or even come close to equalling what can be done by the Apollo once it gets there. In other words, bringing a sample back is so much better than doing analyses on the lunar surface.” (Transcript)

• The Feb. 28 deaths of Astronauts Elliot M. See, Jr., and Charles A. Bassett II received editorial comment.
Washington Evening Star: "Yesterday’s tragedy is all the more shocking in that it needn’t have happened at all. . . .
"It is assumed that Bassett was 'logging flying time’. .. See, a civilian, was not eligible for flight pay but as an astronaut was encouraged to keep his hand as an airplane jockey,
"It is difficult to see why it is necessary for military men on astronaut duty to fly airplanes to qualify for 'hazardous duty’ pay . . .
"Let’s save our spacemen for space, and let’s make it a bit easier for them by amending the military pay act to give uniformed astronauts those few hundred extra dollars a month just for being astronauts.” (Wash. Eve. Star, 3/1/66, A6)
Houston Post: "There is ... an element of irony in the fact that two men preparing for a highly hazardous space mission should die in this prosaic manner, but actually, under the procedures that are followed in space flights, there are just as great risks on the surface of the earth and in its atmosphere as in space, and they probably are much more numerous. If air travel is safer than land travel today, space travel is probably even safer . . .” (Houston Post, 3/2/66)
Missiles and Rockets: "By emphasizing the everyday risk taken by all the astronauts in the course of training, the deaths of Capt. Freeman, Mr. See and Maj. Bassett have almost certainly lessened the outcry against the space program in the event of similar losses during space operations.
"Each time an astronaut steps into a military jet aircraft, he is running a risk perceptibly greater than that he takes in space. . . . [nasa] takes the greatest of care to assure that manned spacecraft launches are as safe as the best engineering talent in the nation can make them. A launch atop a Titan II, hazardous as it may be, cannot compare with the danger inherent in groping through low fog for an elusive runway in a jet aircraft.” (Coughlin, M&R, 3/14/66, 54)

Boron fibers for composite materials have already been produced with a 20 percent greater average strength than they were predicted to attain by 1970. Their monthly production is more than 20 times the total supply that existed three years ago ....
"When we turn to the propulsion area, we find that a new aircraft engine is presently under test, which surpasses the gains predicted for 1970 in bypass ratio, high temperature capability, and reduced specific fuel consumption. The supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, is showing great promise for airbreathing vehicles at speeds of mach 6 or greater. Supersonic combustion has already been repeatedly demonstrated at simulated speeds of mach 6 in test facilities. . . .” (Text)

•	Discovery of two powerful x-ray galaxies which might indicate existence
of a whole family of celestial objects was reported by Naval Research Laboratory physicist Dr. Herbert Friedman at a news conference in Washington, D.C. The two galaxies—Cygnus A and M-87—were among the strongest of the 10,000 galaxies that emit radio signals and had been detected previously only by optical telescopes and by their radio emissions. "The startling thing about these extra-galactic sources is that their x-ray output is 10 to 100 times greater than their combined output of light and radio waves,” Dr. Friedman said, and he suggested that an x-ray satellite or a "fence-like array of 1,000 Geiger counters erected on the moon” could identify the sources. The discovery sup-
ported theory of an "exploding universe” whose evolution over billions of years, and in the future, would be characterized by violent cosmic explosions far beyond the relative calm of the Milky Way.

• In statement presented to the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, summarized significant 1965 mission results: "The 1965 successful Space Science and Applications missions totalled 16. Of these, eight were scientific satellites; three, applications satellites; three, deep-space probes; and two were vehicle developments. Science and applications experiments have also been carried on five manned missions.
"The list of U.S. space firsts was extended during 1965. Ranger IX took the first close-up pictures of the floor of a lunar crater. For the first time, as television pictures of the lunar surface were being obtained from the Moon, they were sent on a real-time basis to home receivers. Mariner IV achieved the first successful mission to Mars. It obtained the first close-up pictures of the Martian surface, revealing the cratered character of the planet. By October 1, 1965, Mariner IV had extended the long-range communication record to 191 million miles; it has since been tracked to its maximum distance of 216 million miles. The various measurements of the Mars magnetic field, atmosphere, and ionosphere constitute significant firsts. Early Bird became the first operational commercial communication satellite. The first full global picture of the Earth’s cloud cover in a single day as it will be observed by tos was provided by tiros ix early in the year. In the Gemini program excellent pictures were obtained of the terrain and the gegenschein, a faint reflection of sunlight from materials dispersed throughout interplanetary space. It was clearly established that astronauts can perform scientific experiments in space, producing excellent usable results.
"During 1965, 138 sounding rockets were launched to continue the investigation of our atmosphere, and to carry out exploratory space experiments. In support of the International Quiet Sun Year, the ship
USNS Croatan launched some 77 rockets while sailing down the west coast of South America. Over 90 per cent of the sounding rocket launches and about 80 per cent of the payloads were successful, yielding data on cosmic rays, and the Earth’s atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetic field. A Goddard Space Flight Center sounding rocket observed the planet Mars in the ultraviolet, indicating an atmosphere pressure of about five millibars at the planet’s surface, which agrees well with the Mariner IV data. Other rocket flights made ultraviolet studies of the [Ikeya-Seki] Comet of 1965, and of the Sun in ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths.” (Testimony; NASA Autfi. Hearings, 341-5)

Acquisition, in testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology, reviewed nasa’s tracking and data acquisition network program: "During fiscal year 1965, the network, under the management of Goddard Space Flight Center, successfully supported four Gemini missions, two of which were manned. So far in fiscal year 1966, three manned Gemini missions have been supported, including the highly successful Gemini VII/VI rendezvous in December.. . .
"During 1965, an average of 32 satellites was supported at any given time. This included satellites launched in prior years which were still transmitting useful data plus new satellites which were launched during
the year. In 1966, the average number of satellites to be supported is expected to increase to more than 35 including flight of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, the Biosatellite, and Applications Technology Satellite.
"In 1967, the average number of satellites to be supported is estimated to exceed 40 with the spacecraft, collectively, contacting the network stations more than 650 times daily. Contributing to the extensive workload in 1967 will be the additional flights of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory, Biosatellite, Applications Technology Satellite, and Orbiting Geophysical Observatory. . . .
"During fiscal year 1965, the [Deep Space] network successfully supported the Ranger VII, VIII, and IX missions and the cruise phase of the Mariner IV mission. The precise operation of the facilities at Goldstone and the control center at Pasadena in support of the Ranger missions was essential to the accuracy achieved in impacting on the surface of the moon, and to the activation of the cameras and transmission of live television pictures of the moon’s surface. In fiscal year 1965, 85-foot antenna facilities at both Canberra, Australia, and Madrid, Spain, became operational and participated in Mariner IV support.. . .
"The excellent support provided the Mariner IV mission permitted the spacecraft, after a flight of 325 million miles and an elapsed time of 228 days, to pass Mars with a deviation of only 1,000 miles from the projected fly-by distance of 5,000 miles and to take the first close-up pictures of the planet. The Deep Space Network continued to support the Mariner IV spacecraft after encounter and established a new twoway communications record of 191 million miles between network stations and the spacecraft. .. . On January 4, 1966, the Goldstone facility received a signal from the Mariner IV spacecraft over a distance of 216 million miles.” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 608, 727-9)

original announcement had reported that a "softlanding” had been planned for venus iii, but a corrected announcement which appeared two hours later eliminated the word “soft” and failed to confirm that the spacecraft had ejected its sterilized capsule. Tass said the descending apparatus had consisted of parachute system and 23.6-in. sphere containing instruments to measure Venusian surface temperature and pressure, to which "heat-resistant substance had been applied ensuring protection from high temperatures when braking in the dense layer of the atmosphere.” venus ii had failed to transmit photos or televise the planet’s sunlit side as programed because of a breakdown in its communications system: “The last radio communications with stations Venus 2 and Venus 3 as they approached the planet were not held for reasons that had not been established.”
Both vEnus ii and venus iii carried equipment to measure interplanetary magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and streams of low-energy charged particles, in addition to special “traps” to determine magnitude of solar plasma and micrometeorites; however, slightly different instrumentation was used to obtain cross-reading of the data. Both spacecraft were similarly constructed with one section for flight equipment and a second for auxiliary equipment. Second section in venus ii carried television photographic device for use during flyby. Tass said venus ii
was to have flown "close to Venus on the side lighted by the sun at a distance not exceeding 40,000 km. (25,000 mi.); venus hi was to have landed on the surface of Venus in the center of the visible disc of the planet.” 89 successful radio exchanges had been held with the spacecraft; data had been recorded to "obtain a high accurate forecast of the movements of both stations,” Tass said.

March 10: nasa Administrator James E. Webb, testifying on the nasa FY 1967 budget request before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said that the gap between the U.S. and Soviet space programs still remained and "this budget will not close it. We are as much as 2 years behind the Soviet Union in certain important aspects of space power. In . . . 1965, they launched 52 Cosmos satellites; successfully orbited a 3-man spacecraft; demonstrated a communications satellite capability with 2 Molniya spacecraft; and orbited the heaviest payload by anyone in the world to date, indicating they have developed a new launch vehicle with some 2M to 3 million pounds of thrust. Since the beginning of 1966 they have achieved a successful soft landing on the moon and they have reached Venus with two probes.
"The Soviet program shows every evidence of a continuing major commitment to long-term, large-scale operations in space. . . . The massive Soviet commitment to a rapid buildup and a long-term program underlines the importance they attached to advancing their space capabilities. It will require a strong and increasing effort initiated no later than fiscal year 1968 and vigorously pushed in the years after the United States has achieved a manned lunar landing to prevent them from forging ahead as the unchallenged leader in space. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth.

•	Quasars are relatively small objects 10 million to 1 billion yrs. old and 30
million to 300 million light years from earth that have been shot at super speeds out of another galaxy by a titanic explosion, astronomer Dr.
Halton C. Arp, Mt. Palomar Observatory, contended in Science. Arp’s theory contradicted prevailing view that quasars could enable man to see the ends of time and space and possibly glimpse the secrets of creation because they were on the rim of the universe—10 or more billion light yrs. away—and were almost as old as the universe—8 billion yrs. Astronomers believed that the quasars’ "red shifts” in light-—changes toward red end of the light spectrum as objects speed away—were caused by extremely rapid motion away from our own galaxy. Arp suggested that quasars might be very dense and compact, exerting a strong gravitational attraction for their size which could shift wavelengths to produce "red shifts.” (Science, 3/11/66; Weil, Wash.

March 11: nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller, testifying on FY 1967 budget authorization before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, stated that nasa had reached a manpower peak of 300,000 people in the manned spaceflight program: "We have passed our peak in engineering, we are reaching our peak in manufacturing, and we are at our peak in total Manned Space Flight manpower resources. . . .
"A striking anomaly of the space program is that we begin to 'go out of business’ before we fly our first operational vehicle. . . . The program to develop the uprated Saturn I launch vehicle illustrates this situation. The decline in manpower on this program has been underway for several months, but the first flight took place only 2 weeks ago—and the first manned flight is almost a year away. By then, the employment level will be almost half the peak level of 1965.”
Reviewing nasa plans for a manned project after Apollo, Dr. Mueller cited five major program alternatives under study. The alternatives "placed emphasis on (1) direct economic benefits to mankind, (2) lunar exploration and science, (3) planetary exploration, (4) maximum effort in all program areas, and (5) a program balanced over the whole spectrum of alternatives, which could be shifted as required to meet national needs.

March 12: Gemini 8 hatch difficulty which threatened to delay March 15 mission was solved by Astronaut David R. Scott. After ksc technicians had discovered that 65- to 70-lbs. pull pressure was required to close cabin door because of too-thick sealant around hatch edges, Scott worked with hatch-closing mechanism until he was satisfied he would have no difficulty closing the door in space. Officials preferred to have required pull pressure at 40 to 45 lbs., But mission rules would tolerate 80 lbs. If hatch could not be closed properly, astronauts would be unable to repressurize their cabin.

Assessing U.S. strength in six subfields, report noted for astrophysics "a pressing need for more observational facilities.” Based on 1964-65 studies by an 18-member group headed by George E. Pake, Provost of Washington Univ., St. Louis, report stated: "Our strength in observational astrophysics with optical telescopes has long been established with the 200-in. telescope on Mount Palomar, but we have many more bright astrophysicists and astronomers than have access to the two US telescopes most suited for frontier research. Our relative strength will be altered with the implementation of plans for construction of several large telescopes in the Soviet Union. Any nation can, by placing a large telescope in the Southern Hemisphere, assume leadership in the observational astronomy of stellar evolution and cosmology, because
the Magellanic Clouds are the nearest of all external galaxies. The United States has taken the initiative in the expensive but highly promising field of space-based optical and x-ray astronomy.
"In radioastronomy the United States now has an impressive group of major radio telescopes, but the US position is not preeminent. Even the new instruments nearing completion at the California Institute of Technology and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory are inferior to existing instruments in Australia and the Soviet Union and to large new crosstype arrays nearing completion near Sydney and Moscow. The US position in space physics and cosmic radiation is good, with some question whether present conditions permit further strengthening of that position.

A pivotal concept that has guided NASA administration has been that of the relation of the research and development project to many rapidly growing disciplines of science and technology. A project serves a larger purpose than its own defined immediate ends. A project is a disciplined and organized effort directed to a specific objective; one of its principal characteristics is
that it has a schedule. As such a project provides a creative and driving force in the total achievement of science, engineering, and technology _____” (Text)
Wesley A. Kuhrt, United Aircraft Research Laboratories, predicted interplanetary and translunar tourist travel for FY 2001: "A six-day round trip to the moon via 35-passenger, nuclear-powered 'clipper’ ships would cost each adventurer $10,000. For an 18-month trip to Venus, the passenger would pay $32,000. Steerage class to Mars, a two-year undertaking, would cost $35,000. But for $70,000 a passenger could ride the Mars Express to and from the red planet in 11 months. . . .” All fares assumed the Government would underwrite the cost of developing the spacecraft, Kuhrt said. Other predictions made at the symposium included teams of superhuman astronauts bred over several generations as a result of present studies in genetics and molecular basis of life; communications between ordinary persons in their homes and anyone, anywhere; versatile robots to perform human tasks; cosmic cargo transported at $10 per pound; network of satellites to link everyone in the world so they could speak in their native languages via rapid automatic translating computers; and man-shaped robots sending back threedimensional pictures to human masters hundreds of miles away. Harvard astronomer Carl Sagan speculated that the trip from other galaxies had already been made and that earth had already been visited from space at least once. (Text)
Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.) told a luncheon audience that “we must lay out basic objectives far enough ahead that they will serve as relatively fixed goals—or in non-technical terms, as dreams. Such an early dream of man was to fly like a bird; later, we gradually translated this dream into making it easy for everyone to fly in an aircraft. We have these dreams and they affect our progress strongly. ...”
To meet these ends, Karth recommended forming a "Hoover-type” Commission to review planning and decision-making system in the area of science and technology. In addition he cited the need for "frequent, systematic, large-scale surveys and analysis of science and technology from the near-term to the distant frontiers of knowledge. . . .” (Text)
In a prediction of what the "Space Age Society” would be like in 2001, nasc Executive Secretary Dr. Edward C. Welsh told the symposium: "The major development over the coming years will be the speed of change. We already have great difficulty maintaining our perspective regarding the change which has taken place during the last 8 or 10 years. Well, that rate of change is like the tortoise pace compared with what; is coming in the future. ...
"Some with fertile imaginations foresee the time when there will be large scale emigration from earth to growing settlements on the moon and the planets. While I see the great growth in the ability to travel to such distant spots safely and speedily, I see little likelihood of any sizable movement of population even though nuclear reactors would furnish much of the competence to make conditions in such places both livable and productive. My reason for not predicting such movement is due to the simple belief that living conditions are going to be so improved here on earth that few would want to leave. .. .
"As for space travel, we can certainly let our imaginations soar, as we are now only in the infancy of growth. The space child has barely
learned to walk. The future with its space travel being almost as common as airplane travel is today is yet to come . . . but it will come. Interplanetary trips, at speeds many times what we now attain, will take place in craft as reusable as the jet plane is today, with at least as many passengers aboard. . . .
"One more thing I can predict with great confidence. The debate on the worthwhileness of space technology and space exploration—still continuing on the part of those of little vision—will have disappeared completely within a decade or so. The benefits will have become so obvious and the potential so exciting that even the most near-sighted will be aware of the rich space harvest. . . .” (Text; Weil, Wash.

Importance of materials science and space vehicle technology was discussed by Milton B. Ames, Jr., Director of Space Vehicle Research and Technology, nasa Hq. oart. "The structural designer of future launch vehicles will face many new and challenging problems. Launch vehicles ... [will be] larger, complex, and more costly. If we are to reuse these launch vehicles without having to spend large sums of money either to bring them back or to refurbish them after recovery, major advances will be required in structural and materials technology.” Development of new materials and methods, such as "superinsulations” to prevent heat leakage; stronger shielding materials to protect spacecraft from meteoroids and intense radiation; advanced lifting-body designs for greater reentry precision; and folding spacecraft parts which could be reassembled in space, would play a major role in U.S. space program before the year 2000, he said.

Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II, nasc staff member, discussed overall economic outlook for space age up to FY 2001. Sheldon noted that U.S. space program took about one per cent of gross national product and estimated that "Soviet Union is putting about two per cent of their Gnp into space efforts . . . .The close tie with military rocketry has speeded space development in these recent years, but it has also saddled space technology with an expendable ammunition philosophy rather than aiming at the lower operating costs of a recoverable transport philosophy. . . .
"Today we probably are headed toward an age of conservation, and one of deliberate recycling .. . the task of the remainder of this century may include the development of closed ecological systems for long-duration space flight, and on a different scale, heroic measures to recycle waste water and to reprocess industrial and consumer wastes into reusable products. . . .
"If our urbanized society requires closed ecological systems even here on Earth, we can, in effect, air condition whole cities.”
Discussing weather modification and climate control, he said: ". . . whether we bend nature itself, or create new sealed urban units, each almost self-sufficient in its ability to control its temperature, clean and recycle its air and water, and put all other wastes to productive use, some such heroic measures will Be needed as this century runs out.” (Text)
March 16: Gemini VIII rendezvous and docking mission—world’s first space docking—began at etr with launch of 7,000-lb. Agena Target Vehicle (Gatv) by Adas booster at 10:00 a.m. est, followed 100 min. later by launch of GEMINI viii by two-stage Titan II Booster with Astronauts Neil
A. Armstrong, command pilot, and David R. Scott, pilot. Primary objectives of the mission—sixth manned flight in the Gemini series—were rendezvous and docking of gemini viii spacecraft with gatv and performance of extravehicular activity (Eva) for one orbit.
gatv was injected into near-circular orbit with 186-mi. (299.5-km.) apogee and 184-mi. (296.3-km.) perigee; gemini viii entered initial orbit with 128.8-mi. (206.4-km.) apogee and 74.9-mi. (119.5-km.) perigee. Near third apogee, Armstrong fired aft thrusters, circularizing spacecraft’s orbit at 168-mi. (270-km.) altitude. Trailing gatv by 139 mi., Armstrong received intermittent lock-on between gemini viii radar and gatv’s companion transponder. After sighting gatv at 66-mi. range at 04:12 get, Armstrong fired thrusters and Scott read out computer data until 05:15 get, when they switched from catch-up to rendezvous mode. At 150 ft. from gatv, Armstrong reported he had matched velocity for brief station-keeping exercise. Conditions at that point were so favorable that Armstrong passed under gatv and came up 80 ft. in front of it, where he was able to read some data on gatv’s status display.
Successful docking was confirmed at 6:33 get. Plan had been to remain docked with gatv through 7M-hr. sleep period until beginning Eva, but at approximately 7:00 get spacecraft-GATV combination began to roll and yaw violently. Unable to stabilize joined spacecraft, Armstrong fired gemini viii’s thrusters to undock and maneuvered away from the gatv. Once freed, however, gemini viii began to roll even more rapidly; roll, pitch, and yaw rates increased, approaching one revolution per min. For three minutes, the astronauts fought to control gemini viii; finally, with oams turned off, Armstrong fired his Reentry Control System (Res) rockets in final attempt to counteract violent roll. This maneuver was successful and eight minutes later, at 7:25:30 get, the spacecraft was stabilized. Within a matter of minutes, the problem was isolated to the spacecraft’s No. 8 thruster, which had fired intermittently while gemini vm was docked with gatv and stuck open until Armstrong managed to turn off oams. It was later determined that a short circuit was probable cause of thruster’s malfunction. Premature use of reentry rockets forced Gemini flight director John D. Hodge to order an emergency landing, with recovery planned in the western Pacific during seventh revolution. (Safety rules of the Gemini program required immediate landing of any spacecraft once its Res squibs were blown; if the flight were allowed to continue, danger of Res fuel depletion would jeopardize firing of Res rockets, vital to safe return of spacecraft and crew.)
Spacecraft landed 500 mi. west of Okinawa in regular emergency recovery area at approximately 10:23 p.m. est—10 hrs. 42 min. after launch. Landing was only three miles from intended impact point. Within minutes usaf frogmen parachuted from usaf C-54 rescue aircraft and placed flotation collar around capsule. At 1:30 a.m. est capsule and astronauts were hoisted aboard recovery ship U.S.S. Leonard
F.	Mason.
Despite early termination, gemini vm mission accomplished one of two primary objectives—rendezvous and docking. Original flight plan had specified four gemini viii-gatv dockings and two hrs. 15 min. of extravehicular activity by Astronaut Scott. Five scientific, four technological, and one medical experiment were to have been conducted. Flight had been scheduled to last 44 revolutions—approximately 73 hrs.

March 16: cosmos cx, launched Feb. 22 with dogs Veterok and Ugolyek aboard, landed safely in U.S.S.R. Tass reported that though "the state of the animals after landing is good,” both dogs had suffered heart beat irregularities that had become more pronounced toward the end of the 22-day flight. Respiration rate hacf changed insignificantly. During initial period of weightlessness, some disruption of coordination had been revealed in "a rocking of the head.” One of the dogs had been "subjected to all the complex of irritants to indicate the reaction and functional ability” of the cardiovascular system; the other was used for control and comparison. Electronic sensors had provided continuous checks on blood pressure, pulse and respiration rates, and other data. Dogs had been fed a paste injected into their stomachs by a pneumatic device. Spacecraft had carried 300 thermoluminescent dosimeters to measure radiation doses in relation to shielding and ten sets of nuclear emulsions to determine the composition of radiation. Scientific information obtained from the flight, which took the animals through the Van Allen radiation belts once during each of cosmos ex’s 330 revolutions, "required special processing after which final conclusions about the state of the animals and inferences about plans for future studies will be drawn.” (Tass, 3/16/66; Av.

• President Johnson received 1966 Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy Award of the National Space Club at White House for "his efforts in shaping the space program from its infancy while a U.S. senator and as chairman of the National Space Council while Vice President and for providing the leadership for this nation’s preeminence in space as President,” and affirmed: "We intend to land the first man on the surface of the moon and we intend to do this in the decade of the sixties.”
He also said: "I think if I were writing my own epitaph this morning I perhaps would prefer to be remembered, for the period I was Vice President, more by this one thing than any other. President Kennedy asked me to attempt to organize and give direction to the Space Agency. I interviewed about 19 men through the United States and finally selected Jim Webb. I prevailed upon him to come and begin this undertaking.
"Within 15 minutes from the time I called the President originally, Jim Webb was out here being announced as the new Space Administrator. I have been very proud of that announcement ever since.
"Your modesty, humbleness, your great executive ability, your great courage, your Marine spirit and determination have made us the envy of the world, Mr. Webb, and we salute you publicly.
"Dr. Goddard was a great prophet, a true prophet. To some it seems almost incredible that a year before Lindbergh had ever flown the Allantic he was dreaming and working to take us up into the stars. Like so many prophets, he was long without honor in his own country, but he never lost faith because his faith was founded on fact. He could turn
aside the rebuffs of the shortsighted; he could laugh at the jokes of his detractors.
'll just wish today that he could be here with us to observe what we have just seen. I don’t think he would be the least surprised by the progress we have made. I think he would be very proud.” (Pres. Doc., 3/21/66, 399; SBD, 3/8/66, 49; CR, 3/21/66, A1621)
March 16: The late Dr. Robert Hutchings Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket from Auburn, Mass., 40 yrs. ago. Annually on the anniversary of the first flight, Goddard is honored by the National Space Club at a memorial banquet in Washington, D.C. In 1962, Vice President Johnson predicted that within 25 yrs. there would be a permanent base on the moon. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, delivering the 1966 address, emphasized that the space budget must be tightly planned: 'll feel the necessity for cost consciousness. This is the need, to put it another way, of getting the most space for the tax dollar. These are times when we must exert high discipline in public expenditure and our space program cannot be exempt from that discipline.” Humphrey said he could foresee "dramatic achievements ahead” in space exploration, notably: (1) exploration of the lurain and possible establishment of one or more permanent bases there; (2) development of "a whole family of earth-orbiting stations, supplied by regular ferry services”; (3) development of "recoverable and reusable launch vehicles” and maneuverable spacecraft; (4) building of spaceports around the country; (5) improvement of propulsion methods so that planetary trips could be made in a week or less; (6) "launching of unmanned probes to every part of the solar system—and perhaps manned planetary expeditions as well.” (Text; CR, 5/4/66)

• Press commented on the gemini viii mission.
New York Times-. "The docking maneuver thus successfully pioneered is of the utmost importance. It is through combining the loads brought into space by individual rockets that the great structures can be built that will be necessary for man’s activities in the cosmos in the years ahead. Tomorrow’s stations in space will serve as laboratories for astronomers and other scientists, as terminals for transshipment of passengers and freight between short-range and long-range rockets, and unfortunately—if the future resembles the past—also as military bases reflecting in the sky the tensions and hostilities of earth. But whatever purpose they serve, these islands in space will have been made possible by repeated use of the same maneuver that Astronauts Armstrong and Scott performed for the first time last night.”
Washington Post: "Space feats have become so commonplace and have been carried out with such precision that we tend to forget about the hazards. The abrupt but fortunately safe return of Gemini 8 is a timely reminder that space is still a frontier and that the exploration remains at best an inexact science.
"That Astronauts Armstrong and Scott emerged unharmed from their awesome experience with their space capsule out of control is a tribute not only to their own cool judgment but also to the extraordinary competence of Space Agency officials. Americans listening to reports of the emergency must have applauded collectively when the crewmen made a successful reentry. They survived a predicament in space which, had it been on a highway, would have meant disaster.”
Washington Evening Star: "In addition to its docking achievement, the mission was a success in the sense of demonstrating the care with which emergency devices were built into the space ship and the thoroughness of the planning for rescue operations in event of a forced landing. It is possible, indeed, that more can be learned from a mission that goes wrong than from one which is successful all the way.
"Incidentally, there is a commentary on our times in the fact that while the suspense-filled space story was unfolding, Batman was being shown on television. The abc network interrupted the program with special news announcements, and was rewarded with more than 1,000 phone calls from complaining viewers.” (NYT, 3/17/66, 36M; Wash.

March 22-25: Air Force Assn, held its 20th annual convention in Dallas, Tex.
usaf Chief of Staff Gen. John P. McConnell told the meeting that U.S. and U.S.S.R. had enough long-range nuclear weapons to make a nuclear war between them extremely costly for either side, but that a stalemate did not exist between them: "It follows that each country has its own nuclear threshold, that is, the point or level of restraint above which it may no longer be deterred from war. This threshold is by no means static but dynamic, as it is determined by a number of factors which are both variable and unpredictable.” McConnell said the strategic superiority of usaf during the past 20 yrs. had kept the nuclear threshold of all potential aggressors at a safe level. (Text)
USAF’s first priority—continued maintenance of strategic superiority over any potential enemy—required a mixed force of missiles and manned bombers, Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Harold Brown told the convention. "We will continue to need manned bombers in our strategic forces as far ahead as any of us can see, and I think that should include at least the entire decade of the 1970s.
". . . There is no doubt about the technical feasibility of advanced manned bombers of all sorts of designs. The questions which have to be answered . . . are how we propose to use such a weapon system and how it fits in to the missions of assured destruction and damage limitation. . . . This issue is under intensive study by the Air Staff. . . .” (Text)

March 25: In answer to charge that the "rush of Jodrell Bank Observatory to distribute Luna IX pictures and of scientists both in the U.S. and U.K. to comment on the pictures can only be considered a breach of ethics [see Feb. 4 and 5],” Sir Bernard Lovell said in an open letter in Science: "We did not 'rush’ to distribute the Luna IX pictures in advance of the Russians. Our pictures came off the facsimile machine several hours after the Russians had convened a large press conference in Moscow to show the pictures which Luna IX had transmitted the previous night. Why they did not do so, or publish them in Izvestia the following morning remains a mystery. As for commenting on the pictures before the Russians, my only remarks were that the lunik seemed to be resting on a hard surface with little evidence of dust, and these comments had previously been made by scientists in Moscow. Any suggestion that we published a scientific analysis of the results before the Russians is absurd.” (Science, 3/25/66, 1477)

Also, the camera pictures are clear and sharp and no stray light appears above the horizon. Apparently the optics remained clean upon exposure a few minutes after landing. The cleanness of the lunar surface may also explain the absence of a visible dust cloud from the impacts of Rangers vi, vii, viii, and ix.” (Science, 3/25/66, 1561-63)
•	Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northwestern Univ. astrophysicist and scientific

They have not described an object. Both sightings were in swampy areas—a most unlikely place for a visit from outer space. The glow was localized here. It could have been due to the release of variable quantities of marsh gas.” Rotting vegetation in swamps produces the gas, Dr. Hynek said, "which can be trapped by ice and winter conditions. When a spring thaw occurs, the gas may be released in some quantity, producing flames which could be yellow, red, or blue-green.” In the Hillsdale case, he added, the sighting might have been assisted by youths "playing pranks with flares.” Hynek’s conclusions were disputed by several of those who had made the sightings.

March 27-30: fcc Chairman E. William Henry warned the broadcasting industry that the day might come when direct-broadcasting satellites would outmode "overnight” local radio and television stations. Speaking to the National Assn, of Broadcasters in Chicago, 111., he said direct-broadcast satellites were still only "a tiny cloud on the horizon,” and there remained "mountains of unsolved problems. . . . But smaller clouds have often traversed higher peaks and released a torrential downpour of new technology and new service on the ground below. The resultant floods have swept aside the older order.” (WSJ, 3/30/66, 5) ComSatCorp president Joseph V. Charyk told the nab convention that communication by satellites would recast the "nature of the world: It may profoundly influence the means of distribution to local stations throughout this country. It may establish new arrangements and new patterns that will have a profound effect on the national television and radio picture.” Charyk said this development was likely to result from satellite linkage with metropolitan communications centers. Linkage would include "color television and stereophonic FM radio, aural and visual telephone service, high-speed facsimile data and newspapers, library reference, theatre and transportation booking services, access to computer facilities, shopping and banking services of all types, and centralized charging and billing.” (Text)

LRC scientist J. Reece Roth described an electric rocket life-support system that would supply interplanetary crews with meals which, when metabolized, would serve as fuel for spacecraft’s engine. According to Roth’s concept, some or all of the propellant, in the form of food, water, and oxygen, would be metabolized by crew to carbon dioxide, water, and solid wastes. C02 and water could then be used as propellant for an electric engine while solid residues would be small enough to be stored or discarded. Propellant reserve could be used for food, navigational corrections, and radiation shielding—enhancing safety of the crew.

•	Addressing the aas in Hampton, Va., nasa Associate Administrator for
Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell said: ". . . as a science, space astronomy simply cannot thrive in separation from ground-based astronomy. In fact, the phrase 'space astronomy’ is a disquieting one. The discipline is astronomy, the objective of which, broadly speaking, is to advance our understanding of the universe in which we live. The word 'space’ in space astronomy refers simply to the fact that sounding rockets, satellites, and space probes are new tools that the astronomer can use in wrestling with the difficult problems of astronomical observation. In perspective, the astronomical community has before it the task of using these new tools in effective combination with ground-based observing so as to best advance the science of astronomy.”
Dr. Nancy G. Roman, NASA Chief of Astronomy Programs, ossa, said: "So far, all space astronomy has been automated. However, as the manned space program matures, plans are being made to incorporate the flexibility of manned operation to the program to an increasing extent. ... We recognize that even simple operations by man could greatly extend both the lifetime and the versatility of an oao, and therefore have been looking into the possibilities of using man in such maintenance activities. Looking further ahead, we also realize that eventually astronomers will want larger telescopes in space than are
possible with the current series of oao’s. Therefore we have had a study conducted on the possibility of building, mounting, and using a telescope of approximately 120 inches in space. The problems are far from trivial, but they also do not appear insurmountable, given the resources necessary for the job.” (Texts)

•	B/G J. C. Maxwell (usaf), faa deputy administrator for supersonic devel-

He explained: "The sst program has been, and still remains, a high risk program. That fact, combined with the sheer magnitude of the development cost, is why the Government is participating in the program to develop an aircraft aimed solely at a civil market.” Adding that the cost estimate was "considerably more than the total net worth of the major aircraft manufacturers combined,” Maxwell said: "Our philosophy for financing the SST program beyond the prototype construction and flight test phase is to encourage industry and the financial community to
assume as much responsibility and risk as practicable. We eagerly look foward to the day when we can turn the whole program over to private enterprise. Conceivably, this could occur when the prototype has flown and proven out the design. If all goes well—and the work performed by the airframe and engine manufacturers during the past nine months gives us cause for optimism—the sst prototype will take to the air in late 1969 or early in 1970 to begin an intensive period of testing. At about this time, production development will get underway with the first production model rolling off the line early in 1973 followed by type certification and entry into commercial service by 1974.” Although the British-French Concorde was expected to be in airline service by 1971, Maxwell said this three-year timelag would be offset by the U.S. Sst’s advantages: (1) cruising speed of mach 2.7, compared with Concorde’s 2.2; (2) 250-passenger capacity, compared with Concorde’s anticipated 140 passengers; and (3) growth potential of titanium construction contrasted with volume-limited aluminum of Concorde.

April 3: Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, told the press that luna x spacecraft had gone into orbit around the moon, but that "all may not be well” with it. He suggested that luna x was tumbling uncontrollably in orbit around moon at distance of 300 or 400 mi.; this theory evolved after Jodrell Bank detected a series of maneuvers beginning at 12:50 p.m. est—15 min. after Jodrell Bank had first picked up luna x’s signals. Frequency of the signals had begun to decrease, indicating the probe was under the moon’s gravitational pull at a distance of about 2,000 mi.; signals then faded out entirely, suggesting that the retrorockets had been fired and the probe had landed. At that point Lovell said: "We think Luna 10 landed at 1:44 P.M. [est].” Minutes later, however, signals again picked up and the situation became "extremely obscure.” He concluded: "At last hearing our signals could be interpreted as coming from a tumbling spacecraft. We find it difficult to believe that it is meant to be tumbling.”
U.S.S.R. had announced luna x’s lunar-orbit mission after March 31 launch. Sir Bernard’s theory came a day before Soviet announcement of mission results [see April 4]. (NYT, 4/4/66, 9; AP, Balt. Sun, 4/4/66; Wash. Post, 4/4/66, Al)

at 1:44 p.m. est April 3 to become world’s first artificial moon satellite, U.S.S.R. announced at 23rd Communist Party Congress meeting in the Kremlin. Accomplishment was dramatized by direct broadcast from luna x of the Communist anthem, "Internationale.”
Tass released details of luna x’s structure and flight. 3,530-lb. spacecraft consisted of two main parts: moon satellite section and engine facilities section. 540-lb. satellite was an airtight package containing radio equipment, telemetry system, equipment for studying the moon and near-lunar space, heat-regulation and power supply systems, and small jet engines to stabilize the flight.
Approximately 8,000 km. (4,969 mi.) from the lunar surface, spacecraft was oriented so that jet of the engine was directed against direction of its movement. At approximately 1:44 p.m. est retrorockets fired automatically, slowing spacecraft to 1.3 km. (.8 mi.) per second and putting it in lunar orbit. Twenty minutes after switching off retrorockets, earth command was sent to separate instrumented lunar satellite from engine facilities section, and first radio communications session was held. Equipment was functioning normally and radio communications were stable.

April 4-6: The importance of imagination in shaping the future was emphasized by afsc Commander Gen. Bernard A. Schriever in a speech before Arnold Air Society’s 18th National Conclave, Dallas: "Back in the 1930s we had what we thought were pretty fantastic ideas for the future. We thought that it might be possible to fly a plane up to the sound barrier. There were even people who thought it might be possible to break through it somehow-—at least for short periods. A few people had heard about Dr. Robert Goddard and his work with rockets. They knew that he had already launched a rocket several hundred feet into the air. Science writers were speculating that we might be able to get something out into space by the beginning of the next century.
"As it turns out, even the most fantastic thinking 30 years ago has proved to be very conservative. We have already flown planes like the SR-71 at speeds greater than mach 3 for extended periods. The experimental X-15 has flown at mach 6 and reached altitudes of over 50 miles. Our long-range ballistic missiles have ranges of from 5,000 to 9,000 miles. And our Mercury and Gemini astronauts have sped through space for extended periods at speeds better than 17,000 miles per hour. With the Apollo program we are not too many years away from landing a man on the moon.” (Text)

Virtually all of these sightings were derived from subjective human observations and interpolations. The most common of these were astronomical sightings. . . . Other major sources of reported sightings include . . . satellites, mirages, and spurious radar indications. The remaining 646 . . . are those in which the information available does not provide an adequate basis for analysis, or for which the information suggests a hypothesis but the object or phenomenon explaining it cannot be proved to have been there or taken place at that time.” Dr. Brown assured committee that USAF would contract a group of scientific experts to conduct an "in depth study” of selected Ufo sightings.

April 7: NASA Atlas-Centaur AC-8 launch vehicle was launched from etb with dummy Surveyor payload. Centaur stage’s failure to achieve
successful double ignition in space caused 1,730-lb. dummy Surveyor payload to remain in earth orbit with the Centaur stage rather than enter simulated lunar trajectory as programed. Orbital parameters: apogee, 208 mi. (335 km.); perigee, 113 mi. (182 km.); period, 90 min.; inclination, 31°. Eighty minutes after launch nasa officials at ksc announced that only one of booster’s two hydrogen-fueled RL-10 rocket engines had fired the second time. Both engines were to have ignited for approximate 107-sec. burn and inserted payload into lunar trajectory. Later analysis of data indicated the failure was because of a malfunction in Centaur’s attitude control system [see May 3]. Purpose of AC-8 mission was to demonstrate Centaur’s capability to restart its high-energy engines in the space environment following coast period in earth orbit. Success of this mission was vital to nasa’s first operational mission which would attempt to land Surveyor spacecraft on the moon. Centaur program was directed by nasa ossa and managed by lrc.

April 9: luna x had detected electrons with energies higher than cosmic radiation, Tass reported: "Data have been obtained which may be interpreted as evidence of the existence in the near-lunar space of fluxes of electrons with energies of tens of thousands of electron volts. These fluxes are 70 to 100 times more intense than the cosmic ray background. Possibly, this phenomenon is due to the earth’s magnetic 'tail.’ Later measurements will permit more positive conclusions on the radiation conditions near the moon.” In addition, preliminary data analysis showed that intensity of the moon’s magnetic field was "somewhat above the level of magnetic fields in free interplanetary space” and that meteorite "particle density” near the moon was higher than in "interplanetary space.”
upi reported that U.S. scientists, including Dr. James A. Van Allen, State Univ. of Iowa, believed radiation observed by luna X was either the earth’s comet tail or a similar feature produced by the moon itself. Reported level of radiation would be no threat to manned operations near the moon, they said. (Tass, 4/9/66; upi, NYT, 4/10/66, 79; AP, Wash. Sun. Star, 4/10/66, A6)

"It was seventy years ago this May that Samuel Pierpont Langley, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, launched his sixteen-foot, steam-powered model airplane off the Potomac River and flew a half a mile in the incredible time of 90 seconds. . . .
"Seventy years—in the larger scheme of history—is not a very long time.
"But though those seventy years are but the average length of a full American life, they reach back into an incredibly distant world—a world that has receded from us by a quantum of change that no other period in the vast sweep of human history can surpass.
"One measure of that change is flight itself.
'll flew here this morning from Washington—nonstop—in 3 hours and 20 minutes.
"Had I made the flight from Washington to Colorado Springs in Langley’s plane, it would have required 127 days—and we would have had to make 2,987 fuel stops along the way. . . .” (Text)

•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb, incoming president of American
Society for Public Administration (aspa), discussed responsibilities of administering a "Great Society” at aspa conference in Washington, D.C. Webb said that ". . . with the seething mass of humanity all around the world, not many of them very happy today, we have a strong requirement for effective administration, precision in the use of public power, for prediction, for planned use of limited resources. . . .
"It seems to me that the public administrator in this period . . . must be a bigger, broader person than has been required in the past because the forces he must work with are so much larger, and yet so much more complex. . . . Somehow he must command the respect and following that will convert criticism from destruction of ideas to clarification and perfection of those ideas. ... I believe his performance will be measured ... by the scope and sweep of his vision and adjustment to some forces that will be beyond his ability to predict or control; also his ability to ride the crest of the wave, that wave of the incoming tide of tomorrow that is now bringing in the fruits of a vital and vigorous society.” (Text) April 16: Preliminary results of flight of U.S.S JL’s luna x, placed in circum-lunar orbit April 3 to become moon’s first artificial satellite, were announced at Moscow press conference. President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Mstislav Keldysh said that considerably less braking power had been required to put a spacecraft in orbit around the moon than had been required in a soft landing. This had made it possible to increase the payload in luna x and to equip it with instruments for important studies of the moon and the space surrounding it.
Academician Aleksandr Vinogradov, geochemist, said that study of radioactivity of rocks on the lunar surface had indicated the overall intensity of gamma radiation on the lurain was comparable to the intensity of gamma radiation emitted by terrestrial granites [see April 13]. However, part of it was not due to natural radioactivity but to interaction of cosmic rays and lunar matter. Such radiation was absent in terrestrial rocks because of the shielding effect of the earth’s atmosphere. Lunar rocks were comparable in natural radioactivity to basalt rocks on earth, indicating that "the processes of the formation of the core of the planets of the earth group apparently have the same mechanism.” Prof. Naum Grigorov said readings of luna x’s magnetometer indicated presence near the moon of a weak, homogenous, and regular magnetic field. Streams of ions of small energies were registered. Analysis of materials transmitted by luna x showed the intensity of particles
in the moon’s radiation belt was 100,000 times less than in the earth’s radiation belts.
Prof. Alexandr Mikhailov, director of the Pulkovo Observatory, said existence of an artificial moon satellite was important not only for physical research, but also for determining more exactly the mass and shape of the moon—information vital for building an exact theory of the motion of the moon and for study of the unevenness of the earth’s rotation.
Replying to questions, Academician Keldysh said luna x did not carry photocameras but was intended for physical study of near-lunar space and the moon itself—its nature, ionosphere, radiations, and fields. Satellite would orbit the moon for “a few years.” Duration could not be predicted since parameters of the moon’s gravitational field were not known. Keldysh said that since assembly of large spacecraft in orbit was an important step toward the conquest of outer space, cosmonauts were preparing for the solution of this task. Referring to the problem of manned flights to the moon, he stressed that the most difficult task to be solved was return of the spacecraft into earth’s atmosphere. Keldysh said dogs Veterok’s and Ugolyek’s passages through radiation belts in cosmos cx had had no apparently serious effect on them but that prolonged observations were necessary. (Tass, 4/18/66)
April 16: nasa Assistant Administrator for International Affairs Arnold W. Frutkin addressed the American Academy of Political and Social Science in Philadelphia on international significance of space program: ". . . the United States has welcomed direct foreign participation in space research and exploration. The U.S. has contributed its boosters to launch six satellites which were conceived, engineered, instrumented and funded by cooperating foreign countries. Eight more such satellites are to be launched by us under existing agreements and, at this date, other agreements are in early prospect. We have opened our own satellites to foreign experimenters. Some twenty experiments proposed by scientists abroad have been selected on their merits for flight on our satellites. These foreign experiments are contributed to the program; we contribute space in the satellite and its support systems and retrieve the data for the experimenter. Even wider cooperation—with twenty different countries —is achieved through programs which utilize small, nonorbiting rockets to obtain data for which satellites do not commend themselves. In all of these projects, we have shared the tasks and costs in literal cooperation without exporting a dollar.” (Text)
April 17: New evidence supporting theory that Venus’ environment could sustain life was published by Johns Hopkins Univ. astrophysicists William Plummer and John Strong in Astrophysical Journal. Past measurements of microwave emissions from Venus had indicated very high surface temperatures. Plummer and Strong concluded, on the basis of recent detailed measurements from high-altitude balloon observations by Cal Tech radioastronomers, that possibly "30 percent of the observed microwaves in the past had no bearing on surface temperatures but rather emanated from electrical discharges within the cloudy atmosphere of Venus.” They estimated Venus’ temperature ranges from 580°F ai equator to 9°F at poles and said there are extensive regions—greater than earth’s land area—"where man would find the temperature comfortable.” (NYT, 4/18/66, 4; Wash.

•	Supersonic transport and rocket flights in the next few decades could
raise the average surface temperature of the earth by almost half a degree by spewing tons of chemical pollutants into the atmosphere, said Dr. Gordon J. F. MacDonald, ucla planetary and space physicist, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. Heavy burning of coal, oil, and gas introduced by the industrial revolution in the 19th century and the automotive revolution in the 20th had increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 15 per cent, MacDonald estimated. The carbon dioxide created a layer of gas that allowed heat from the sun to reach the earth but stopped it from escaping when it was re-radiated back from the earth. This was the "greenhouse effect,” which raised the temperature below the layer and lowered the temperature above the layer. "Four hundred supersonic aircraft flying four flights a day on intercontinental routes, would affect surface temperatures as much as the whole industrial and automotive revolutions have to date,” MacDonald said.

•	A new nuclear particle—the most massive and most stable yet found—
had been discovered by physicists at Argonne National Laboratory (anl). Three and a half times as heavy as the proton, the particle wa9 "a 'nucleon resonance’ known simply as N*3245.” The number "3245” stood for 3,245 million electron volts, the amount of its energy. According to Dr. Alan D. Krisch of Univ. of Michigan, nucleon resonances "may be 'excited’ or highly energetic states of protons and neutrons . . . and can be produced only in accelerators. They are not observed in nature.” Krisch, along with John R. O’Fallon, Keith Ruddick, and Steven W. Kormanyos of Univ. of Michigan, and Lazarus
G.	Ratner of anl, made the discovery using Argonne’s 13.5-billion electron volt (Bev) zero gradient synchrotron. They said this "abnormally stable” particle has a lifetime of one ten-thousandth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a second, which is "longer than that of any of its family of nuclear particles.” Krisch suggested N*3245 may have "an unusually high spin which prevents it from decaying easily.”

April 18: Capt. Robert F. Freitag (usn, Ret.), Director of Field Center Development, NASA omsf, speaking in Washington, D.C., before the Community Development Conference of the 16th District of Texas, said that the magnitude and importance of the investment in the space program dictate that informed citizens from all walks of life participate in a national dialogue on decisions involved: "We in NASA do not feel that the planning of our space programs is the prerogative of nasa alone... . The budget for the coming fiscal year permits nasa to hold open the option for a program to procure additional flight vehicles beyond those now programmed, so as to employ the Apollo hardware, facilities and capabilities at least through 1971. If we do not exercise this option in the decision for the 1968 budget, we will have to begin a phase-down of the manned space flight activities and the 'mothballing’ of some of our facilities. At a small fraction of the initial cost we can continue and we can expand our operations in space for the next ten years and more. These operations will have tremendous implications for our national security and for our position of world leadership, in addition to the benefits of scientific advancement and the betterment of man’s life on Earth. ... In the area of national security, our expenditures in space probably represent the cheapest insurance policy the nation can buy for the future.” (Text)

It is urgent and imperative that this study be adopted, or something like it, as our major basic strategy beyond the moon. The first job is to adopt a national strategy. This is not just a decision of nasa; it is a decision of the administration, of the Congress, of the American people.
"And second it is urgent and imperative that this study be translated by joint actions of nasa, the National Academy of Sciences and American scientists into specific tactical plans for a specific program with dollars attached to it. For example, in my opinion, it makes little sense to undertake the first Martian landing without some precedent exploratory steps. We must first orbit and map the planet and ascertain where a landing would be profitable.
"To do the planetary exploration job effectively, we now need a tactical program of specific flights on specific dates with the instru-. mentation necessary to plan to accomplish those tasks. I remind you that what we are doing today was planned in 1961. And yet, when we
get to our planetary program in the 1970’s, we don’t have corresponding specific plans.” He reemphasized the urgency by saying: "If we are to achieve in the planetary exploration of the future in an intelligent way, in light of the objectives of the Space Act, the time has come to get our scientists started now. Your vehicle program is already ahead of us.” Dr. Berkner said that the long-range program should meet certain specifications: "(1) step-by-step advancement of experiments in the proper order; (2) use of the right vehicles to carry out the experiments; (3) effective use of Saturn capabilities, from unmanned missions to the ultimate manned landing on Mars and perhaps Venus, and (4) proper phasing-in of smaller vehicles with the larger ones, and reasonable time/cost programming.” (msc Roundup, 5/27/66, 3)

Some of nasa’s advanced planners argued for $500 million in the Fiscal 1967 budget now under consideration, but the agency went to the Bureau of the Budget with a request for only $270 million, which was reduced to the $41.9 million.” (Normyle, Av.

•	Two controversial theories about the earth’s crust to be tested by the
Mohole geological project were reviewed in Science. One theory held that material flows slowly but constantly up from deep in the earth and then spreads out across the ocean floors. Second theory was that the earth’s magnetic field reverses periodically so that successive bands of rock would have alternate polarization, depending on the time the molten material had frozen and locked in its magnetism. Drills would attempt to probe different rock bands to determine if their charges were different and when they were formed. First field trials were scheduled for early 1968. (Science, 4/25/66)

April 25-28: American Physical Society met in Washington, D.C. Geophysicist S. K. Runcorn, Univ. of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K., suggested that Jupiter’s great red spot may be "the top of a 200-mi.-high column of 'stagnant air’ carried along” by a meteorite crater in the planet’s hydrogen surface. This view would contradict a widely held notion that the spot is associated with a high mountain. "We don’t believe in mountain ranges on Jupiter, at Newcastle,” Runcorn said, explaining that Jupiter’s crust would not support a mountain. He noted that the large surface feature connected with the stagnant air column might be a depression caused by impact of an asteroid or "a moonlet.” Runcorn said explanation of red spot as column of gases supported theory of Jupiter’s fluid metallic hydrogen core, (aps Release, 4/20/66; Simons, Wash.

Dr. Harold Brown, Secretary of the Air Force, examined management role of scientifically trained people and invited their participation in the "governmental decision-making process.” Brown, a former physicist, attributed rising influence of technocrats "to the increasing technical content of modern life” and to "the less narrowly technical orientation of the technically trained.” He noted transition from parttime to full-time scientific advisers in the late 1950’s as "one of the major lasting consequences of the Soviet Sputnik achievement.” (Text) nasa’s ogo i, launched Sept. 4, 1964, and explorer xxviii (imp-c), launched May 29, 1965, had yielded data essential to evolution of an accurate physical description of the universe, according to paper on
low-energy cosmic rays presented at aps meeting by Dr. Donald E. Hagge of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Hagge noted satellite measurements and recent "quiet sun year” had given physicists "an unprecedented opportunity . . . for meaningful cosmic ray research.” High-apogee satellites permitted measurement of low-energy particles "not directly observable on the surface of the earth” due to protective atmosphere and influence of earth’s magnetic field. Minimum of "solar modulation”—suppression of galactic particles by sun’s magnetic field upon attempted penetration of solar system—meant that "particles observed during 1965 most nearly represent the true situation outside the solar system.” (gsfc Release, 3/27/66)
J. A. Simpson of Enrico Fermi Institute, Univ. of Chicago, reported these satellite experiments had revealed "new features in the cosmic radiation regarding the energy distribution, the chemical and isotopic composition of the cosmic rays at hitherto unattainable energies.” Origin of "ultra-low-energy nuclei,” which reached vicinity of earth during 1965 period of minimum solar modulation, may be supernovae, Simpson suggested.

Simpson and J. J. O’Gallagher, also of Fermi Institute, presented results of study of solar flare particle propagation based on simultaneous observations by mariner iv space probe and Imp satellites. Evidence showed that "protons are confined by interplanetary magnetic fields to narrow channels extending outward from the sun” and "particles in these channels are carried around the sun by magnetic fields which co-rotate with the sun.” (Fermi Institute Release, 4/29/66) Paul J. Coleman, Jr., of ucla, presented results of "a recently completed statistical analysis of records of the magnetic field and plasma velocity, obtained in late 1962 with instruments aboard the spacecraft mariner ii,” including "experimental evidence that [hydromagnetic] waves do exist in interplanetary space.” Discussing properties of solar wind, Coleman said mariner ii’s measurements had indicated average temperature of positive ions in plasma was about 200,000°K. He,noted that its high temperature and low density "suggest that the plasma is completely ionized.” (aps Release, 4/26/66)
Discussing importance of their NASA-sponsored stellar wind study, S. H. Lam of Princeton Univ. and G. Sandri of Aeronautical Research Associates of Princeton, Inc., said: "The cosmic radiation that reached the Earth, or any satellite that has been sent into space by man, has been attenuated, or as the specialists say 'modulated,’ by the solar wind. Therefore, we cannot measure directly the constitution of the cosmic radiation as it exists in interstellar space unaffected by the solar wind. Yet, to be able to understand the origin of the cosmic radiation, we must know its true constitution in interstellar space. A proper understanding of the solar wind will greatly facilitate this difficult task.” Lam and Sandri presented electrostatic model for stellar winds at APS meeting, (aps Release, 4/29/66)

Describing the Alfven Propulsion Engine (Ape) in a paper on hydromagnetic propulsion and drag in space vehicles, M. A. Ruderman, New York Univ., said: "A source of electrical power (nuclear, or solar panels) sufficient to power one hundred common light bulbs could raise the altitude of a 5-ton satellite about 100 miles in a week of operation. By allowing the motor to act as a generator the orbital energy of this same satellite can be converted into electrical energy, contributing sufficient drag to lower the satellite altitude by almost 15 miles per day.” (aps Release, 4/26/66)
Cal Tech physicist H. Victor Neher described latitude survey of cosmic rays: "Once we satisfied ourselves that instruments sent by balloons up to altitudes of 140,000 feet, near the earth’s magnetic poles, gave answers directly comparable to those found by Mariners II and IV, it became less important to depend on spacecraft for our data. This was good news because we have a flexibility and control of balloon flights that are not possible with spacecraft.” (aps Release, 4/28/66)

We have, however, begun to recognize new applications for space-based systems, particularly in the tactical field. The opportunities are tremendous—and sometimes so are the problems. We are no longer as enamored with the 'how’ of developing a satellite system. We now take a hard look at the 'why’ of choosing one approach to solving a military need over another—and this most assuredly includes competing earth-based systems as well. We have come to recognize that our launch vehicle capability coupled with better sensors permits us to do more missions from synchronous orbit. We also are beginning to sense that there is a high potential for combining operational functions in a multiple-purpose satellite where common sensor packages and orbital parameters exist.” (dod Release 341-66)

Sherwin said the value of R&D had been confirmed by "Project Hindsight,” a study covering such systems as the Mark 46 torpedoes, Minuteman II, Hound Dog, Polaris, Sergeant, and Lance missiles. "We are not sure whether good ideas attract 'good’ (that is, flexible) money, or if innovative organizations just 'happen’ to always have such money. Available technology money simply must be spread all over the place in little pockets near the need. It is not the ivory towers which need flexible money the most, it is rather the organizations heavily involved in real problems— particularly in the early stages of development of new systems.” (Text)

April 28: nasa issued a fact sheet on U.S. international space programs which listed criteria applied to determine value and acceptability of cooperative arrangements in space activity: (1) cooperative project must have scientific validity and mutual interest; (2) cooperative project must be conducted openly, with the scientific results being made freely available to the world scientific community; (3) each participant must accept financial responsibility for its own contribution to the project.
Since their inception, nasa’s international programs had involved 71 countries or separate jurisdictions and had included satellite projects, individual experiments flown on nasa satellites, sounding rocket investigations, and a variety of programs in which foreign ground-based observations were coordinated with flight projects.
U.S. had concluded bilateral agreements providing for launch of 14 scientific satellites instrumented and, in all but two cases, engineered abroad. Six of these satellites had already been successfully launched (one each for France and Italy and two each for Canada and U.K.). Other satellites would be contributed by the European Space Research Organization (esro), U.K., Canada, Italy, and Germany.
U.S. had also opened its own satellites, manned and unmanned, to participation by foreign experimenters. Sixteen such experiments had been accepted for flight.
Some 17 countries had entered into agreements with NASA for one or more cooperative sounding rocket projects. Such investigations had been initiated by both U.S. and foreign proposals. They had accounted for roughly 150 launchings in a five-year period with rockets ranging widely in size and type, from boosted Darts and Areas to Nike combinations, Aerobees, Shotputs, British Skylarks, and French Centaures.
Ten cooperating countries made substantial contributions to experimental communications satellite work by constructing and operating
overseas ground terminals used for TV and radio demonstrations. Conventional weather observations in 42 countries helped interpretation of cloud-cover photographs from weather satellites.
A 1962 agreement with U.S.S.R. had resulted in: (1) one-way communications demonstrations using echo ii, (2) some exchange of ground-based magnetic field data in anticipation of an agreed exchange of satellite data, and (3) exchange of conventional weather data over a special communications channel set up between Washington and Moscow on a shared-cost basis pending the availability of satellite data from U.S.S.R.

April 28: Izvestia described how the Communist Party anthem was transmitted from luna x to earth: "Before the launching, an electronic generator was installed in the artificial moon satellite to radiate in a definite sequence electric oscillations of the frequencies necessary for reproducing selected fragments of the melody. . . .

The 'music’ signals of the set installed in the Luna 10 could be received even from the neighborhood of Venus.
"The increase in range and the overcoming of cosmic noise were achieved by means of special narrow band-pass filters. The cycle of functioning of the instrument reproducing 'Internationale’ consists of two parts: generating in a certain sequence signals of various frequencies —10 seconds—and creating intervals before the repetition of the melody—45 seconds.

"We should do it as part of a national renaissance on all fronts; for a great society . . . cannot confine its attention to certain challenges selected under past conditions, but must . . . move comprehensively to accept the challenge of the future.
".. . As the huge challenge of space generates and consumes and then regenerates our material and human resources, so does it widen the scope of the environment in which our citizens will exist and make their contribution in the years ahead.” (Aerospace, 4/66, 7-9)
• Commentary on numerous reports of Ufo sightings:
Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Britain’s Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, said Ufo’s were "purely American phenomena.” What people really see "is most likely weather balloons, meteorites, fireballs, re-entry of nose cones or other space debris. No trained observer or astronomer has ever reported such a sighting.”
Philadelphia Evening Bulletin: "Sir Bernard Lovell, the eminent British astronomer who runs the Jodrell Bank space observatory, believes that seeing ufos ... is strictly an American phenomenon.
"Maybe he is right, but IF Americans are seeing ufos, and IF there are visitations from outer space, it may be that the terrestrial visitors believe that only America is worth investigating.” (Phil. Eve. Bull., 4/26/66)
Rev. Francis J. Heydon, professor of astronomy at Georgetown Univ., said that people "are seeing things,” but that reports of flying saucers would "doubtless increase. The phenomenon of flying saucers is 100 percent imagination.”
Roscoe Drummond, Washington Post: "History is littered with examples of the most eminent scientists who were dead certain that things couldn’t be done . . . and wrote with great displays of scientific evidence to prove that they couldn’t be wrong. We need more objective investigation than we have been getting. The scientific unbelievers may be right—but they could be totally wrong. They have been before.”
Howard Simons, Washington Post: ". . . scientists point out that even traveling at the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles per second, whoever it is that is buzzing America in a flying saucer or saucers would have to have left the nearest galaxy 50,000 years ago.” (AP, Wash.

•	A Soviet victory in the race to achieve first manned lunar landing "would
be a worldwide propaganda disgrace because we ourselves chose the target . . . [and] a crushing political blow at home to the President linked with it, which the present White House incumbent has been from the inception,” wrote William J. Coughlin in Missiles and Rockets. He suggested a possible solution: ". .. extend the U.S. national goal prior to a manned lunar landing by either the U.S. or the Soviet Union. Then, if the Russians were the first to arrive on the Moon, we would be in a position to gracefully acknowledge their achievement while pointing out that to us the Moon was but a way-station en route to a more distant objective. If we accomplished the first landing, we would also have the benefits of victory. But we would not be so exposed in the event of a defeat. . . .
"Without establishment of a higher goal and a greater challenge, U.S. space capability will dissipate, nasa efforts to prevent this by getting a worthwhile Apollo Applications Program under way have not met with notable success. This provides a second good reason for lifting our national goal. . . .” (Coughlin, M&R, 5/2/66, 46)
During week of May 2: msc officials had not pinpointed exact cause, but had isolated probable cause of faulty thruster which prematurely terminated gemini viii mission March 16, Missiles and Rockets reported. Corrective action would affect all these components on Gemini 9 and later spacecraft. Gemini program manager Charles W. Mathews emphasized that thruster and its associated hardware and electronics were contained in adapter module abandoned by crew in orbit prior to reentry. "If we can believe telemetry data, we can isolate the cause of the problem to either spacecraft wiring or thruster valve solenoids,” Mathews said. Specific trouble spot within wiring or valve solenoids would be difficult to determine without testing actual equipment. (M&R, 5/9/66, 17)
May 2-4: alaa met in Washington, D.C. Satellite Educational and Informational Television (seit)—concept of combining television and com-
munications satellites to raise standards of living in less-advanced nations—was discussed by Vincent P. Rock, director of Communications Central. He emphasized lack of literacy requirement for television instruction and noted that it could (1) "transmit skills and knowledge required for modernization of productive activity; (2) transmit fantasy which helps a person understand the role and techniques of association required for participation in a modern society; and (3) transmit information about events and goods required for action in the modern world.”
Following his speech, Rock told the press that a demonstration SEIT system would cost about $30,000,000, excluding ground receiving equipment, and could be ready in three years. Transmissions from satellites could either be received on six-foot "dish” antennas and relayed to individual receiving sets or relayed directly to home sets. (Sehlstedt, Balt. Sun, 5/3/66)
James D. O’Connell, White House Director of Telecommunications Management, warned of frequency shortage for satellite communications by 1970 unless new techniques were devised. O’Connell urged aerospace engineers who started "this communications explosion” to "consider all ideas and concepts” that would squeeze more talk into existing broadcast frequencies. (Clark, NYT, 5/4/66, 23)
U.S. should assume active world leadership in direct satellite-to-home radio and television broadcasts which offer tremendous potential for mass education and mass propaganda, suggested Columbia Univ. law professor Richard N. Gardner in a panel discussion. Warning that several nations had already asked international bodies to outlaw general broadcasting from space for fear of "unilateral penetration” or unwanted propaganda, Gardner urged: (1) the Administration to proceed immediately in developing direct broadcast satellites; (2) the organization of a pilot demonstration project, perhaps in India, with U.N. endorsement; (3) the involvement of aid and other international lending agencies in educational use of space communications; and (4) the reassurance of friendly nations that comsats would not be used for propaganda.
Murray L. Schwartz, Univ. of Calif. School of Law, told panel that satellites were one more example of a technology that might be moving too fast for existing social institutions. A "knowledge explosion” helped by space communications would accelerate homogenization of society and "one of the great problems is to make sure the homogenization is not too great,” he said.

May 3: House passed nasa authorization bill for FY 1967 (H.R. 14324) totaling $4,986,864,150 as follows: $4,248,235,000 for research and development; $94,419,000 for construction of facilities; and $644,210,150 for administrative operations. NASA had requested $5,012 billion.
During debate preceding bill’s passage, Rep. James G. Fulton (R-Pa.) offered amendments, subsequently rejected, to eliminate $41.9-million funding for Apollo Applications program and $9.1-million funding for construction of lunar sample receiving laboratory at msc; to reduce advanced missions by $5 million; and to cancel $10 million of prior authorizations for Facility Planning and Design. Rep. Fulton also offered, but later withdrew, an amendment to establish an Inspector General’s Office in nasa.
Commenting on nasa’s $5,012 billion request for FY 1967, Rep, Fulton said: "[It] generally represents a tight program in terms of the
allocation of resources to the programs that have been regularly approved by Congress as parts of the Nation’s effort in aeronautics and space.
"At a level under $4.9 billion, I do not believe nasa can restructure its Apollo program moon landing in a form that would not cast the most serious doubt as to its ability to meet the objective of the manned lunar landing within this decade.
"At $4.8 billion the moon landing objective could not be met. Below this level of the budget, it would become clear that the Nation had abandoned the concept of developing a well-rounded total space capability directed toward achieving space preeminence. . . .”
Rep. John Wydler (R-N.Y.), proposing an amendment to earmark $20 million of the total h&d funds for development work on the problem of aircraft noise, suggested: ". . . it is incumbent upon us to bring this [space] program closer to the people and show them some way in which it can benefit them. We often hear there is going to be a fallout as a result of this program—some kind of fallout that will affect the civilian population beneficially. Here is an opportunity to give them some fallout directly that will be of benefit to them. . . .” Rep. Wydler’s amendment was defeated. (CR, 5/3/66, 9189-9223)
May 3: Malfunction in Atias-Centaur launch vehicle’s attitude control system was responsible for Centaur stage’s failure to achieve double ignition in space during April 7 AC-8 mission from etr, nasa announced. Preliminary analysis indicated that one or more small attitude control jets on Centaur stage apparently used excessive amounts of hydrogen-peroxide gas, causing early depletion of system’s fuel supply.

C. R. Able, group vice president of Douglas Aircraft Co.’s Missile and Space Systems Div., outlined to the group plan for converting empty hydrogen tank from Saturn V’s 3rd stage into manned space capsule. For conversion, series of metal balloons containing liquid oxygen would be added to original orbited payload, to serve later for breathing and for combination with hydrogen to operate fuel cells for producing electricity. An Apollo or Gemini spacecraft would dock with empty 3rd stage, and astronauts would emerge to remove end cover plate in end of the tank, after purging it of any hydrogen remaining from launch. An airlock, carried aloft as part of original payload or launched later, would be attached to opening left by removal of cover plate and tank would be repressurized with oxygen from metal balloons to provide astronauts with "shirtsleeve environment.” Tank walls would have about 100 shallow threaded holes for mounting work benches, furniture, or other convenient items, presumably launched separately. Able emphasized that purpose of stage conversion—to offer astronauts relief from cramped quarters and extended weightlessness—did not duplicate function of USAf’s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol). Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Aircraft Corp., and Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. each had $50,000 nasa contracts to study use of booster cases.

•	Editorial comment on President Johnson’s proposal:
". . . In addition to rules governing space exploration a body of law is needed to govern the exploitation of useful resources that may conceivably be found on other solar bodies. Omission of this topic from the first international treaty on space law could produce future difficulties. But the President may well have felt that any present attempt to reach agreement on this delicate matter might prolong negotiations beyond the time of the first manned lunar landing. . . . There is no time to lose in getting international agreement to and ratification of this essential document.” (NYT, 5/9/66, 36)
". . . Someday such a treaty may save us from a new sort of far-out interplanetary imperialism. As revived by Mr. Johnson, however, the proposal has to do with a problem that will develop sooner and closer to home. After all between now and 1969 or 1970, Americans are going to be lofted to the moon’s surface, and so are Russians. This is a prospect full of very great historic importance. It lends special force to the President’s call for a renewed effort ... to negotiate an understanding

"The first manned landing on the moon seems likely before 1970. The implications are immense, regardless of whether the first one is American or Russian. President Johnson’s proposal for an international compact to govern this and outer space explorations makes much sense.
". . .Perhaps a willingness by Moscow to entertain a treaty on space may also open the door to discussions about pooling some of the costs, as the late President Kennedy proposed.” (Boston Globe, 5/11/66)
". . . Probably the most succinct argument against a comprehensive treaty of this nature is, 'Who needs it?’ Monopolization of the lunar surface by military units and establishment of terror weapons on the moon or in orbit appear to be neither immediate dangers nor remote possibilities. The bugaboo of an orbiting multimegaton H-bomb seems, on close examination, to be more trouble than it would be worth. . . .
"There is no slightest indication that the Russians propose to lay claim to the moon if their cosmonauts get there first, any more than we do if we win the race. The precedent followed by both countries in Antarctica—nearest thing to the moon on earth—is neither to assert nor to recognize territorial claims. This was U.S. and Soviet policy before the Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959. . . .” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 5/12/66, A20)

• Lockheed Aircraft Corp. chairman Courtland S. Gross described flight in proposed U.S. supersonic transport (Sst) in an interview for This Week: "It will make the world a lot smaller. Its near two-thousand-mile-an-hour speed will carry passengers to London and Paris in two and a half hours. With room for 255 to 266 passengers, five abreast, it will be a 222-foot walk from the tail to the pilot’s cabin.
"But the biggest thrill will be cruising at 70,000 to 80,000 feet above the earth. At that height you will enjoy the kind of stars and sky seen heretofore only by U-2 pilots and astronauts—pinpoint icicles suspended in the blue-black velvet backdrop of space. Most of the atmosphere is below the supersonic transport’s cruising altitude, so that at night, on the horizon, there will be the bright blue band first reported by the astronauts—light radiating from the other side of the earth. When flying the polar routes around the world, passengers will enjoy spectacular electrical displays from the ionization of gases in the upper atmosphere—great shimmering curtains of color that flicker through the sky.” (This Week, 5/8/66)

•	Text of Soviet Academy of Sciences’ August 1965 proposal to International
Astronomical Union (iau) for an international effort to search for signals from other worlds was made public in Vienna. Proposal, which implied that peculiar objects such as quasars represented the kind of beacon a civilization with extraordinary capability might build, recommended two kinds of searches. First would look for narrow-band signals which a "civilization with the meager energy resources of earth” could send to another star. Concentration of the energy into narrow range of wavelengths would ensure signals’ survival for hundreds of light years. Search would be confined to 21-centimeter wavelength in the spectrum emitted throughout space by hydrogen.
Second search would be for signals spanning much of the spectrum which a super civilization with the energy resources of a star would generate. Such signals would be difficult both to decode and recognize as artificial. Proposal, which recommended round-the-clock observations for three to five years, would be discussed at iau General Assembly in Prague Aug. 22-31, 1967. (Sullivan, NYT, 5/10/66, 19)

May 10-19: 1966 Committee on Space Research (cospar) meeting was held in Vienna.
National Academy of Sciences delegate Dr. Richard W. Porter, summarizing activities of 1965 U.S. space program, said a manned lunar landing by 1970 would be a "difficult goal” but U.S. had made "substantial progress.”
Dr. Porter presented an analysis of data transmitted by NASA mariner iv Mars probe which appeared to support theory that earth sometimes has comet-like tail stretching past orbit of Mars. On Feb. 5, 1965, a peculiarly timed solar eruption sent series of intense proton clouds into space, five of which were detected within 48 hrs. by mariner iv and two other U.S. satellites in near-earth orbit. Second and third clouds were reported by mariner iv three to five hours prior to their detection near earth, possibly because solar eruption had blown earth’s tail to enormous length, forcing two clouds to detour through tail in order to penetrate earth’s magnetic field. (Sullivan, NYT, 5/11/66, 16; Toth, Wash. Post, 5/12/66, A14)
Chief Soviet delegate Anatoli A. Blagonravov summarized 1965 U.S.S.R. space program, and said luna x, which entered lunar orbit April 3, had recorded radiation pattern from lunar surface similar to that from basaltic part of earth’s crust. Apparently lunar surface exhibited no differentiation equivalent to granite on earth, indicating that earth and moon were created separately, luna x had found level of moon’s magnetic field barely above that of interplanetary space; small increase was attributed to moon’s passing through earth’s magnetic tail at time of measurement. Implication was that moon is cold throughout, since liquid metal core would produce large magnetic field. Report suggested that new minerals would be found on the moon because of unusual chemical reactions caused by its extreme temperature range, the impacts of micrometeorites, and rains of high-energy radiation. (Sullivan, NYT, 5/11/66, 16; Toth, Wash. Post, 5/12/66, A14)
Soviet delegate A. G. Prishchep, in a joint paper with colleague V. I. Vashkov, revealed that U.S.S.R. planetary probes were assembled in clean rooms and sterilized with two-fold process involving moist heat to prevent dryness and a gas mixture, harmless to the skin, which might have important surgical applications. Gas mixture contained 50% ethylene oxide—extremely poisonous substance which is dangerously
explosive when combined with oxygen—diluted with 40% methyl bromide for safety reasons.
General Electric scientists H. G. Lorsch and M. G. Koesterer reported that current sterilization cycles varied from treatment at 320° for three hours to baking at 200°F for 14 days. They argued that no more than 10 billion microbes should exist within a spacecraft prior to beginning of sterilization if reasonable chance of killing virtually all of them was to be assured.

Drs. Herbert Friedman and R. W. Kreplin, Naval Research Laboratory, reported that solar radiation level would probably exceed highest ever recorded in 100 yrs. during 1969-1970—time of first projected manned lunar landing. Basing their prediction on measurements of solar x-ray emissions taken by explorer xxx (iqsy Solar Explorer) satellite, Friedman and Kreplin explained that x-rays, which could not penetrate earth’s atmosphere, warned of approaching sunspots before they could be seen. Solar activities in the form of sunspots and gaseous flares occurred in 11-12 yr. cycles, but there was also a gross cycle which reaches its greatest intensity every 80 to 100 yrs.

Reports on little-publicized efforts were presented to the meeting: (1) Italy’s platform for launching San Marco earth satellite at sea was in African port of Mombasa and would be towed shortly to site where U.S. Scout booster would launch satellite into equatorial orbit; (2) Pakistan was conducting monthly firings of rockets that injected copper chaff into stratosphere to disclose winds in that region over subtropics; (3) U.S.S.R. had fired 150 meteorological rockets—almost half from shipboard—and U.S. was firing about 120 monthly; (4) Romania had used orbital data from Washington and Cambridge, Mass., to photograph echo I and echo ii comsats in coordination with Soviet expeditionary stations in Egypt and Mali; (5) Sweden, Finland, Russia, and East Europeans had joined in observing orbital flight changes of echo i and echo ii attributable to density variations in wisps of air at satellite altitude; and (6) East German scientists reported their conclusions on upper air structure derived from real-time transmissions from NASA explorer xxh satellite. It was estimated that 60 stations in various parts of the world were monitoring satellites that sent out "blind” data. (Sullivan, NYT, 5/15/66, 10E; Sullivan, NYT, 5/16/66, 88)
Dr. A. I. Lebedensky, Soviet Academy of Sciences, reported that luna ix photos revealed lunar surface was steadily eroding, at least in some places. He suggested that erosion could be caused by solar winds or impact of micrometeorites. Lebedensky pointed out two peculiar features on luna ix’s photos which supported his theory. First was series of streaks, resembling mineral veins in earth’s bedrock, on floor of crater where luna ix had landed. It had previously been assumed that moon’s surface was buried deep in debris churned up by meteorite impacts. Second was presence of rock-like objects on small pedestals
similar to those on earth where soft but rock-strewn surface had been eroded. Stones, which ranged in size from one foot to less than one inch across and whose pedestals appeared as high as they were wide, "were the most unexpected and important result of the flight,” Lebedensky said. "Our conclusion is that the stone is harder than the ground around it and screens the ground underneath from the erosion effects of solar winds and micrometeorites.” Lebedensky admitted the possibility that erosion was peculiar to the crater or a particular region of the moon, but saw no obvious reason why this should be true.

High pulse rates and dehydration—findings common to both U.S.S.R. and U.S. manned experiments—were observed, and on fourth to fifth day after dogs’ return there was "rather considerable speedup” of erythrocyte sedimentation reaction and an increase in number of leucocytes in blood, both apparently in response to normal gravity. In summary, doctors said that while functional changes did occur during flight, they were not irreversible. Whether or not zero gravity could change functional state of organism to extent that it could not return to normal was not yet known. (Tass, 5/16/66, uss-t Trans.; M&R, 5/23/66, 12)
•	Sen. Karl Mundt (R-S.D.) informed Senate that Subcommittee on Govern-
ment Research expected to make specific recommendations to improve Federally-financed research and development program, for which almost $16 billion was being expended during FY 1966. Sen. Mundt, ranking minority member of the subcommittee, said primary task of group was to determine and enunciate a more definitive, longer-ranging science policy. He said U.S. had reached the crossroads, where "it has become painfully obvious that we cannot continue to support all who demand support, but must be selective in the allocation of research funds.” This indicated that one of the most pressing questions was how to direct NASA efforts, with Apollo program reaching its goal and no follow-on approved: "nasa now is on the threshold of placing a man on the Moon within this decade. After this what? This question concerns the leaders of this fine NASA organization as well as its highly trained, scientific and technical staff. Where do we turn? Shall the space program continue on its present course, or shall it be broadened to better serve the everyday needs of the American people? This is a priority crossroads. . . .” (CR, 5/16/66, 10212)

May 17: Gemini IX mission was scrubbed when Atlas booster failed to place Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (Gatv) in planned 185-mi. (298-km.) circular orbit. Launch of Gemini 9 with Command Pilot Thomas Stafford and Pilot Eugene Cernan was to have followed 99 min. after Atlas-Agena launch; Gemini spacecraft was to rendezvous and dock with Gatv to evaluate extravehicular life support and maneuvering equipment and procedures.
Simultaneous countdown of the Gemini Launch Vehicle/Spacecraft and the Atlas-Agena had progressed smoothly and the Atlas launch was normal until 121 sec. after liftoff. Then, said the Flight Safety Review
Board: "The Atlas No. 2 booster engine swiveled to an extreme hardover position about 10 sec. before booster engine cutoff. The other booster engine and the sustainer engine, acting under auto pilot control, continued to work to counter the asymmetrical thrust.
"After booster separation, the vehicle continued the flight under sustained thrust but at a down angle. It had also rolled to a position where ground guidance could not lock on or reacquire. Signals to shut down the sustainer engine and inhibit ignition of the Agena engine were sent ; nd acted upon by the vehicle. Agena separated on schedule and both vehicles plunged into the sea.”
Gemini IX-A mission was scheduled for May 31—and later rescheduled for June 1—using Augmented Target Docking Adapter (Atda) as target vehicle, (nasa Releases 66-97, 66-124; msc Roundup, 5/27/66, 1; Wash. Eve. Star, 5/17/66, Al, A6; Lewis, Wash, Post, 5/18/66, Al, A6; NYT, 5/18/66, 1, 26)
May 17: In its 17th annual report, the U.N. Commission to Study the Organization of Peace said the General Assembly should "declare the title of the international community” to the high seas and outer space. Six reasons were cited: (1) to avoid conflicts over them between nations; (2) to keep their resources from being wasted; (3) to prevent their military use; (4) to prevent their contamination; (5) to ensure that all nations benefit from their resources; and (6) to provide the U.N. with an independent source of income.
Report continued: "Member nations are not willing to pay assessments adequate for the task they expect the United Nations to perform. The revenues of the United Nations must therefore be augmented by independent sources of income. No one can estimate now what the income of the United Nations might be from its granting licenses for the exploitation of the resources of the seas and the revenues which should accrue to it from outer space communications. It is estimated, however, that the amount of money to be realized certainly should make an important contribution to the United Nations budget. Furthermore, it should help pay for . . . technical assistance to the developing states.” (AP, Chic. Trib., 5/18/66; Oatis, Wash. Post, 5/19/66, G5)

•	Summing up the effect of May 17 loss of Gemini IX mission’s Agena
Target Vehicle, William Hines said in the Washington Evening Star: ". . . it is obvious that at the very least the American space effort has lost three weeks of precious time and possibly $25 million in money— the cost of the lost Hardware plus overhead. . . .
"One thing should be clear from the experience of Gemini 9.
"There was nothing of omission or commission that can be charged against NASA in the failure of the Agena’s Atlas launching rocket. If the hackneyed phrase 'random failure’ ever was properly used, it was in describing yesterday’s trouble.
"The Atlas, as a standard space launching vehicle, has had 49 successes in 52 attempts over the last three years—a better success record than the over-all American space program has enjoyed in any year since its inception in 1957.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 5/18/66, A8)

•	Editorial comment on May 17 scrubbing of Gemini IX mission: New York
Times: "For the third time in the past few months, a space experiment involving the Atlas-Agena rocket Has run into trouble. Late last year a sequence of events similar to yesterday’s led to a postponement of the original Gemini rendezvous experiment, while in March of this year, Gemini 8 nearly met catastrophe when it was docked with an Agena target vehicle. There may well be no connection between these three separate incidents; but since the Atlas-Agena has been a highly reliable and successful instrument in other aspects of the nation’s space pro-
gram, its emergence as the weak link in the Gemini series poses something of a mystery. The setback caused by last year’s failure to orbit an Agena target vehicle was made up for by the brilliant improvisation that permitted Geminis 6 and 7 to rendezvous last December. Warned by that earlier experience, space officials were better prepared for this latest setback. The substitute target rocket they have on hand may permit much of the originally planned Gemini 9 experiment to take place early next month. But for the moment at least, a shadow has again been thrown over this country’s lunar program.” (NYT, 5/18/66)
Washington Post: "We shall do well to prepare for many more disappointments before man reaches the moon, including the possibility of serious accident. What remains essential in the competition is that considerations of human safety not be sacrificed to too feverish a schedule.” (Wash. Post, 5/18/66)
Washington Evening Star: "The simple fact is that the United States has been incredibly lucky that no catastrophic accident has yet taken place during a manned space flight. The further fact is that the nation cannot logically expect this luck to last forever. Progress in space, as with nearly all human progress, will come at the cost of men’s lives. And the nation should be prepared for the day when our luck runs out; prepared to accept tragedy as the inevitable concomitant of so ambitious a voyage of discovery.” (Wash. Eve. Star, 5/18/66, A18)

May 19: Interplanetary spacecraft pioneer vi, launched by NASA Dec., 16, 1965, reached perihelion—75.7 million mi. from sun—at 10 p.m. edt. Among findings reported during probe’s 260 million mi. of travel: exact measurement of average numbers of particles in interplanetary space; fact that high-energy particles thrown out by solar flares (principal radiation hazard to man) traveled in well-defined streams which were twisted about one another; and solar wind did not travel in straight lines, pioneer vi had identified new ion (singly ionized helium) in solar wind, had found magnetic-field effects on solar wind temperatures, and discovered that sun’s magnetic field occurred in filament-like "stringers” extending out from its corona. Spacecraft had revealed that regions on sun produced many solar flares and high solar wind velocities, as reported by mariner iv. During its 154 days in solar orbit, spacecraft had transmitted to earth 340 million readings of 3,000 separate scientific measurements and sent back 3 million readings of 100 individual engineering measurements. Specifications called for operating life of six months (complete on June 16, 1966), but it could be extended if larger antennas were available to hear pioneer vi as it moved progressively away and ahead of the earth on its smaller orbit around the sun.

May 19: William Hines charged in Washington Evening Star that publicity given to proposed U.S. supersonic transport (Sst) was ". . . part of a propaganda barrage aimed at the American taxpayer, who in the years ahead will be called upon to underwrite deficits clearly predictable in building and operating a costly fleet of airplanes capable of spanning the Atlantic in two hours.
"The sst program has been publicized since the program’s inception in 1963 with the same combination of gobbledygook and public-relations hokum used so successfully in merchandising the moon program. Technological challenge, the asserted psychological-spiritual imperative, and the added spur of an international 'race’—all are cited as reasons compelling development of a 2,000-mile-an-hour super-airliner.
"Actually the sst, when built and placed in operation, will be no more a free-enterprise product than the Saturn-5 moon rocket is.

May 20: Checks of distributions of Martian and lunar crater diameters indicated that the visible surface of Mars was 2.2-to-3 X 109 years old, Alan B. Binder, Univ. of Arizona, reported in Science. This result implied that in the early history of Mars large-scale subaerial erosion occurred. Of 69 Martian craters with diameters greater than 10 km., 13% had central peaks. This compared favorably with the frequency (11.7%) of central peaks among lunar craters and may indicate the peaks resulted from the impact mechanism rather than post-impact volcanism. Well-defined system of lineaments shown in mariner iv photographs may indicate that Mars had lost appreciable angular momentum during its history. (Binder, Science, 5/20/66, 1053-5)

"It is these forcing functions which mainly set the pace of progress and development. Space is no exception. Indeed, the great surge in space research and exploration is a classic example of this historical pattern. It was these forcing functions which set in motion the revolution in science and technology which has brought us to the era we know as the Space Age. And it is these forcing functions which today and tomorrow will determine our future course and our future policies in space. .. .

May 23: Important information on one of several x-ray sources, observable only from space, had been obtained by experiments on March 8 sounding rocket flight from wsmr, nasa announced. Initial results from data analyzed revealed that the angular size of the x-ray source in the constellation Scorpius, Sco X-l, could not exceed 20 arc-seconds. This discovery disagreed with widely held view that this source represented an ancient nearby (Milky Way) supernova. It strengthened current speculation that the sources in Scorpio and many of the other x-ray sources are an entirely new class of celestial objects characterized by small angular size which are either undetectable or star-like in visible light or radio emission. The detail with which the angular size of this x-ray source was measured was more than 20 times greater than any previous measurement [see June 17-18]. (nasa Release 66-125)

•	Optimistic assessment of prospects for exploring Mars during the next
decade and finding some form of life there was presented by scientists at the AAS-sponsored symposium on "The Search for Extraterrestrial Life” in Anaheim, Calif. Carlos De Moraes, director of planetary program studies for Martin Co., visualized a series of space flights from 1969 to 1979 and culminating in the landing of two 3,500-lb. "space buses.” First flight, in 1969, would be of an 850-lb. spacecraft that would provide televised mapping of the Mars surface and take measurements of the atmosphere. After a series of intermediary flights, the space buses would land in 1979 and release both automated biological laboratories and roving vehicles that would explore and gather samples at points away from the immediate landing area.
Dr. Norman H. Horowitz of jpl noted that "any form of life, however primitive, found on Mars would be of immense scientific value.” He said that no matter how bleak the picture, the possibilities of life on Mars should be explored to the fullest because that planet appeared to be the likeliest site for life beyond the earth.
GE engineers P. G. Thome and Ernest J. Merz described giant clamshell under development that would be part of a system launched by a Saturn V booster in 1973. The thick disc-shaped object would open like a giant mollusk when landed on Mars, releasing devices that would start gathering information on atmosphere, weather, soil, and life. Information would be telemetered back to earth. Disc could be powered by radioisotope-fueled generator that could keep it in operation for up to six months. (Texts)

Would we have to kow-tow to a more advanced civilization, or dominate an inferior one? Suppose they had no more, or even less, feelings of love and responsibility? Might meeting with an advanced society push man further toward creating a culture of frantic fun?” (AP, Balt. Sun, 5/26/66)
May 24: Senate unanimously passed by voice vote the nasa FY 1967 authorization bill of $5,008,000,000—$121,135,850 more than the sum voted by the House but $4 million less than President Johnson had requested. In speech on Senate floor during passage of bill, Sen. Spessard L. Holland (D-Fla.) said that if the U.S. failed to continue development of solid propellants, it would fail in the one thing it "should be doing to catch up with the Soviet Union in the field of space effort.” Senate bill included only the $3.5 million requested by the Administration for one additional firing of a half-length 260-in. solid rocket motor. In other debate, Sen. Joseph S. Clark (D-Pa.) said he felt that national priorities were "substantially out of order when the Senate, in the course of 5 or 10 minutes, passes a $5 billion authorization bill to send a man to the moon,” and that he hoped the space effort could be put on an international cooperation and not a competitive basis. Clark was joined in his remarks against the bill by Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.), who said such action was "typical, today, of any bill relating either to outer space or the military ... in my view, it is an outrageous distortion of priorities.” (CR, 5/24/66, 10715-20)

afsc Commander Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, in luncheon address, cited three factors which could restrain full advancement of technology: "The first of these constraints is the relative silence of our opponents. A few years ago the headlines were full of Soviet threats of orbital bombs, missiles that could 'hit a fly in the sky,’ and similar weapons. Today, by contrast, the Soviets are not boasting about their new weapon developments. . . . The second constraint is the argument made in some quarters that U.S. military research and development could be 'provocative’ to our opponents. This argument overlooks the fact that our very existence as a free society is 'provocative’ to our opponents, because it contradicts their theory of history. . . . The third constraint is the immediate need for large funds to support our forces in Vietnam. . . .” To overcome these constraints, General Schriever said, "we must harness our management experience and technological knowledge to serve the national purpose,” in an effort involving every "segment of our national life. . . .” (Text)

May 25: nasa successfully launched explorer xxxii (ae-b) aeronomy satellite from ETR with three-stage Delta booster. The 2nd stage burned 8 sec. longer than planned—failing to cut off and running to propellant depletion—and boosted the satellite into a higher orbit than planned. Orbital parameters: apogee, 1,688 mi. (2,717.7 km.), as opposed to planned 750 mi.; perigee, 180 mi. (289.8 km.); period, 116 min.; inclination to equator, 65°. Launch was third time Delta 2nd stage had failed to shut down on time and sent 3rd stage and payload to higher altitudes.
Built by gsfc, and the last of the original satellites outlined by nasa when it was established in 1958, the 495-lb., 35-in.- dia. explorer xxxii was designed to investigate temperatures, composition, densities, and pressure in the upper atmosphere and their diurnal, seasonal, and annual variations on a global basis, nasa later announced that adjustment of onboard programing of spacecraft’s sensors had compensated for higher apogee and useful scientific measurements would be taken that were not planned originally. All eight experiments onboard were functioning "as expected” and spacecraft was spin stabilized at the required 30 rpm.
First aeronomy satellite, explorer xvii, was launched April 3, 1S63. Results included first direct measurement of neutral helium; first in situ measurements of concentrations of neutral atmospheric constituents at satellite altitudes as a function of time and solar activity; first data revealing difference by a factor of two (approx.) in value for atmospheric density as determined from onboard sensors and from changes in satellite’s orbit; first detailed description of diurnal and latitudinal behavior of summer ionosphere near altitude of F2 maximum over eastern U.S. at time of solar maximum.

May 25: Fifth anniversary of President John F. Kennedy’s call before a joint session of Congress to undertake a manned lunar landing in this decade.
•	Referring to President Kennedy’s challenge five years ago "to achieving
the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth,” William Hines commented in the Washington Evening Star on the progress made:"Of course, Kennedy did not 'invent’ space. Nor did he, in a single 1,100-word exhortation to Congress, create all the conditions needed to make a lunar program possible. The United States had quite a respectable space effort going for several years before Kennedy spoke, and indeed the first American astronaut had flown a brief suborbital mission three weeks earlier.
"The foundations on which Kennedy could build a moon program were there. What he did—with advice and urging from many advisers including the then Vice President Johnson and the late 'grand old man of space,’ Hugh L. Dryden—was set a goal. . . .
"The call to leadership in space came at a particularly troublous time in the new Kennedy administration’s development. In the month just past, April 1961, the United States had suffered two tremendous setbacks in what had been called 'the battle for men’s minds.’ On April 12 Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin orbited the earth—a full 10 months, as it turned out, before Astronaut John Glenn would match his feat. And on April 19 the bottom fell out of the ill-conceived Bay of Pigs adventure to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 5/25/66, Al, A5)

•	usaf Flight Safety Review Board announced it had pinpointed cause of
the Atlas booster failure during the aborted Gemini IX mission May 17: gimbaling of the booster engine which forced the Atlas-Agena into a hardover trajectory was caused by a short circuit in the electrical command system of the engine pitch servo valve. Although several other failures could have caused a similar occurrence, the Board said, only this one could have caused the exact set of data received from the launch vehicle. Malfunction was called a random failure, but to ensure that it would not happen again, new tests would be made on the Atlas and electrical connections in all new boosters would be x-rayed.

May 28: NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George
E.	Mueller, speaking at meeting of Texas Radiation Advisory Board and Texas Atomic Energy Commission in Freeport, Texas, cited reasons that it was vital the U.S. be pre-eminent in space: "First, consider the national security, or peace-keeping, aspects.
"Although our space program is a peaceful endeavor, it cannot help but have a profound effect on our future military position. Although there is no military space force in being in any nation’s arsenal, it would be disastrous for the United States to lack the basic understanding, the basic technology, and the basic engineering which would be required if an aggressor should choose to make space a battlefield. . . .
"In the international arena, our space program—and Manned Space Flight in particular—may be considered as a measure of our ability to compete with a formidable rival, and as a criterion of our ability to maintain technological eminence.
"The influence of our scientific and technological progress and prowess is and has been one of the deciding factors in keeping the Cold War peace over the past 20 years. . . . Should we fall behind in the area of space technology, we would jeopardize our national interests, on earth as well as in space.” (Text)
May 29: The Nation was facing a crisis in space planning, NASA Administrator James E. Webb said in a press interview at NASA Hq. The question was what to do with the Apollo project after men had landed on the moon. The answer would determine whether the U.S. remained a "major spacefaring nation,” and must be found within a year, he said— long before the first lunar landing was made. Search for the answer had been postponed several times because the problem seemed remote and budgets were tight. "It is extremely important not to think you can postpone the decision again. I think it is imperative to have a thoroughgoing national debate on whether we want to go past the point of no return.” If the Nation did not mind being second to the moon or chose to "dismantle the Apollo machine without recovering its great investment,” he would accept that, he said. But he did not believe that either the Congress or the public had consciously reached these decisions. He feared they just had not thought about them. (Clark, NYT, 5/30/66, 1, 22)

During May: Secretary of the Air Force Dr. Harold Brown said in an article written for NATO's Fifteen Nations that one of his principal tasks had been to find the most effective way of integrating technical and nontechnical advice. Of contributions scientists had made to the process of defense policy-making, he said: "First, the scientist, operating at the frontiers of knowledge, may have anticipated many political and military problems posed by scientific advance. Second, military necessity made the scientist a leader in applying sophisticated rational and mathematical analysis to the solution of some problems—especially resource allocation —which have been generated by scientific advance.
"At the same time it must be acknowledged that advice from scientists had been far from infallible, especially where the advice touches upon aspects of a larger problem on which the specialist is less expert, and in some cases, may not even be fully informed.” (NATO's Fifteen Nations, 4-5/66, 18)

Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.) cited recent approach by Subcommittee in reallocation of funds during hearings on nasa FY 1967 authorization: "The Congress makes resources available for our national space program in the name of the American people.

This principle was reflected in the actions taken by the Subcommittee.” Karth was writing in Astronautics & Aeronautics. (Karth, A&A, 5/66, 26-8)
•	Revolution in military communications "to which we are now fully com-
mitted and which we are actively pursuing,” was discussed by William Beecher in Astronautics & Aeronautics: "At this writing, the Pentagon plans a May launch of the first eight of a series of 14 to 22 repeater satellites in its Initial Defense Communications Satellite Project (Idcsp). The first eight, riding piggyback on a Titan III-C test booster, will be deposited into random orbits about 21,000 mi. up. Within 60 days thereafter, another six repeater satellites together with two gravity-gradient experimental satellites will be similarly orbited. If all 14 of the communications satellites function perfectly, sufficient coverage will be provided to obviate the need for a third shot of eight, Pentagon experts say.
"Although meant primarily to perfect the technology of space communications, after a relatively short test-only period, this Idcsp would be made available for high-priority worldwide military traffic—for instance, important communications between Washington and Saigon. . . .
"Then, in 1969 or 1970, the Defense Department hopes to put up a fully operational system, called the Advanced Defense Communications Satellite Project (Adcsp). As John S. Foster, Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering, described it in recent Congressional testimony, 'This system will take advantage of advances in both booster and communications technology which will permit the establishment of an economical, highly reliable system capable of providing many secure, jam-resistant, long-range communications circuits to support vital security operations wherever they occur.’ ” (Beecher, A&A, 5/66, 10)

•	B/G J. C. Maxwell, director of faa Sst development, discussed supersonic
air travel in Aerospace:
". . . The national sst program, though small (from a dollar point of view) when compared to the national space program, nevertheless may well have a more immediate impact. The challenge inherent in producing an economically attractive supersonic aircraft has already identified and created demands for improved manufacturing techniques, simple yet reliable electronic and communications equipment, advancements in extrusion and machine tooling techniques, more efficient (and less costly) fuels and lubricants ana many other needs.
"The economic aspects are more easily definable.
"Concerning the potential market for the SST, varying estimates have been made based on the expected growth of air transportation over the next 20 years and beyond. . . .
"Conservatively speaking, we now look for a three-fold increase in long-hard revenue passenger miles flown by the airlines of the world by 1980 and a five-fold increase by 1990. ssts could carry almost half of this traffic. . . .
"Obviously, the sst program will have a significant impact on the U.S. balance-of-trade position. Based upon past experience along with current encouraging signs, we expect that the export market for a U.S.-made sst will be about half of the total production rate. Over a 20-year period, this could result in a gold inflow approaching $10 billion.” (Aerospace, 5/66)
During May: Space research programs of the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. were opening the way for solving earth’s future overpopulation problem and mankind’s future raw material needs, Soviet Prof. E. Kolman wrote in Mirovaya Ekonomika i Mezhdunarodnyye Otnosheniye, a publication of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He referred to estimates that in 400 yrs. the earth would have a population of about 900 billion people, equivalent to about 10,000 people per square mile. In such a situation, this planet would not be able to give all its people even elementary living space, let alone food. Therefore, he said, "escape into cosmic space . . . will become inevitable.” Professor Kolman mentioned the stimulating impact of the space program on progress in science and technology and the likelihood of developments useful in more mundane areas of human activity. He cited the use of meteorological and communications satellites as examples of terrestrially useful byproducts of space research. (NYT, 5/22/66, 85)

June 2-14: nasa surveyor i became first U.S. spacecraft to softland on the moon when it touched down in the Ocean of Storms and began transmitting the first of its more than 10,000 clear and detailed television pictures to jpl Deep Space Facilities, Goldstone, Calif.
Landing sequence began 2,000 mi. above moon when, traveling at
6,000	mph, surveyor i shifted its normal cruising attitude to position main retrorocket. Triggered by radar ejected at 52-mi. altitude, main retrorocket burned until 37,000-ft. altitude, slowing craft to 400 mph. After retrorocket burnout, smaller guidance rockets ignited, slowing surveyor i to 3Yi mph at 14-ft. altitude. Craft then free-fell to lunar surface at 8 mph. Landing—so precise that spacecraft’s three footpads touched lunar surface within 19 millisec. of each other—confirmed that lunar surface could support Apollo Lunar Excursion Module (Lem) and proved concept of automatically decelerating a spacecraft from 6,000-mph speed to touchdown speed of 3H mph.
Photos transmitted by surveyor i before its camera was secured after sunset of first lunar day (June 14) revealed nearly level lunar surface littered with rock fragments [see During June]. "Rubble scattered over the surface is probably a fairly general characteristic all over the moon,” nasa Surveyor Project Scientist Dr. Leonard Jaffe told jpl press conference.
Pictures taken June 4 during seven two-second firings of nitrogen gas from spacecraft’s attitude control jets showed no disturbance of the lunar surface. In addition to wide- and narrow-angle lurain photographs, surveyor i obtained pictures of the stars Sirius and Canopus to determine spacecraft’s exact location.
Halting communication with surveyor i June 14 to allow spacecraft to conserve battery energy throughout lunar night (June 14-29), JPL announced: "It is very difficult to predict if Surveyor’s batteries will withstand the —260°F cold. If Surveyor survives, the engineers estimate it will be several days after sunrise before the batteries thaw out” [see June 28-29].
Considerably more complex than Soviet luna IX which softlanded on the moon Feb. 3, surveyor i apparatus remained a closed intact system up until touchdown.

June 2: President Johnson’s statement on surveyor i’s successful soft-landing on the moon: "Overnight the eyes of Surveyor I have become the eyes of the world on the Moon. Another exciting chapter in the peaceful exploration of the universe is open for men to read and share. . . .
"The odds against achieving full success in such a difficult mission on the first flight were understandably great. This moment of triumph for all who have participated in the Surveyor project has been well earned, for back of Surveyor’s perfect performance on this first flight are years of hard work, painstaking care, and brilliant engineering.
"Today our Nation salutes the highly deserving team of scientists, engineers, technicians, and managers—in Government, industry, and the universities—who have a vision and the skills to pursue it successfully.
"As the day approaches when men land on the Moon, it is of the greatest importance that we agree to exchange openly all information that could affect their safety and welfare. It is equally important that we preserve these regions for peaceful, scientific activities.

Daily Telegraph, London: "There is magic of a kind in the latest achievement of American exploration in placing their electronic Surveyor almost directly on its target on the moon. . . . The technological power behind the enterprise of putting a man on the moon is mounting with visible acceleration. But the human element remains most vital.”
Le Monde, Paris: "In succeeding with their first attempt at a soft landing on the moon only three months after the Soviets, the United States has shown that they are on the point of catching up with the Soviets in the race to the moon. There is only one experiment left in which the United States is behind the Soviet Union: the orbiting around the moon of a lunar probe similar to Luna-10. This lag is not very great, since the first trial of the Lunar Orbiters is set for next month.”
R Tempo, Rome: "We think that the best judgment, even if purely a prioristic, of the Surveyor is that given by the Soviet Government, which, the day after the departure of the lunar probe, practically adhered to President Johnson’s initiative of March 7, tending to a recognition of the internationalization of the moon and other extraterritorial bodies.”

June 3-6: nasa’s gemini ix spacecraft, with Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford as command pilot and Eugene A. Cernan, pilot, was successfully launched from etr by Titan II booster on gemini ix-a mission to evaluate extravehicular life-support and maneuvering equipment and procedures, and to rendezvous and dock with Augmented Target Docking Adapter (atda), launched from etr June 1. Initial orbit: 174-mi. (280-km.) apogee; 99-mi. (159-km.) perigee; 90-min. period; and 30° inclination. At T—3 ground communications system malfunction which had postponed June 1 launch recurred, but alternate procedures proved satisfactory and countdown continued.
At 49 min. get Stafford executed first course correction to position gemini ix for rendezvous, firing thruster rockets to raise perigee to 134 mi. After two more orbital maneuvers, spacecraft was within 25 ft. of target. Stafford, sighting atda, confirmed suspicions that its shroud had not jettisoned, and docking would be impossible. He radioed ground control: "It looks like an angry alligator out there.” nasa later revealed that shroud had not jettisoned because technicians, following "insufficiently detailed” written instructions, had installed lanyards improperly.
Complying with modified flight plan, astronauts photographed atda, executed re-rendezvous maneuver, and executed rendezvous-from-above simulating Lunar Excursion Module (Lem) abort from the moon. After this maneuver, which depleted fuel supply to 11%—only 6% more than minimum reserve—Stafford and Cernan were fatigued and recommended 24-hr. postponement of Cernan’s walk in space.
At 11:02 a.m. est June 5, Cernan opened hatch of depressurized spacecraft, climbed out, and retrieved micrometeoroid impact detector attached to side. He moved to full length of 25-ft. tether to take photos. After one hour, Cernan returned to Adapter Section to don Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (Amu)—a task which required "four or five times more work than anticipated.” His faceplate visor began clouding over, presumably because environmental control system was not absorbing moisture quickly enough. Ceman’s limited visibility and discovery that Amu’s radio transmissions were garbled forced Stafford to recall him to spacecraft. He had been scheduled to disconnect from gemini ix’s oxygen supply and maneuver in Amu to 150 ft. from spacecraft.
Reentry on June 6 was normal. At 10:00 a.m. est, in the 46th revolution, gemini ix impacted 345 mi. east of Cape Kennedy—less

Accomplishments of gemini ix-a mission were summarized by. Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, at msc news conference: (1) demonstration of three new rendezvous procedures—catching target in only three revolutions, locating it without radar, and approaching it from above rather than below; (2) accurately controlled reentry; (3) longest period of extravehicular activities—over two hours; (4) new information on man’s ability to work in space necessary for manned lunar landing and for assembling stations in space; and (5) new information on manned observation of another spacecraft in orbit. Five experiments were successfully performed in accordance with modified flight plan. Concerning mission’s disappointments, he said: "We will try to do as much as we can on each of our Gemini flights. We won’t always succeed in meeting all of the objectives.

•	U.S. had current "edge” over U.S.S.R. in overall space capability but
this status had been "recently acquired and is not sufficient to form even the slightest basis for complacency,” Dr. Edward C. Welsh, nasc Executive Secretary, told Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Assn. Industrial Luncheon in Washington, D.C. Dr.Welsh analyzed the areas of relative accomplishment: "(1) Number of spacecraft. The United States has placed almost 400 spacecraft into earth orbit and on escape missions, while the USSR has put slightly less than 200 on such missions. . . . However . . . Soviets have placed each year a greater total weight of payloads. ... (2) Lunar and Interplanetary. The United States has been far less active but considerably more successful in its interplanetary activities. . . . We have photographed Mars and had a productive fly-by of Venus while the USSR’s active interplanetary program has been primarily plagued by failure. In addition, we have taken some 17,000 photographs of the moon and are taking hundreds more by the magnificent Surveyor spacecraft. ... (3) Manned Flight . . . U.S. . . . has a distinct lead over the USSR with about 1500 man flight hours in orbit compared with about 500 . . . with the longest individual flight as well as the longest extra-vehicular activity. Also, the U.S. has had two controlled rendezvous maneuvers, one docking experiment, and considerable manned spacecraft maneuvering experience. So far, the USSR has achieved none of these latter goals. (4) Space Applications. The United States has navigation, weather, and communications satellite systems in regular operation, while the USSR is still in the developmental stage in such activities. (5) Scientific Data . . . the larger number and greater variety of U.S. scientific payloads, as well as the wider and freer dissemination of the information obtained, may well have added more to the world’s store of knowledge. (6) Propulsion . . . the USSR has surpassed the United States in the field of propulsion so far as the amount of thrust is concerned [but] this thrust advantage is much less true today as both countries have in operation and under
development larger and more advanced propulsion systems.. . .” (Text)

During June: Lurain as seen by surveyor i Science Evaluation Analysis Team after preliminary analysis of data was a dark, relatively smooth, gently rolling plain "the consistency of a freshly turned field,” studded with craters ranging in diameter from one inch to several hundreds of feet and littered with fragmental debris ranging in size from few hundredths of an inch to more than three feet. Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, U.S. Geological Survey, said terrestrial scenery most closely resembling the lurain as seen by surveyor i would be Sedan crater at aec’s Nevada Test site—large crater covered with small craters and "secondary ejecta” resulting from explosion of subsurface nuclear device. Lurain appeared to be composed of soil-like substance, or a fine sand, with rougher material through it. It appeared to be about three feet deep with harder surface beneath. Surface had dynamic bearing strength of 6-10 psi. Leonard Jaffe, nasa Project Surveyor scientist, noted that results of surveyor i could be summarized by list of previous theories on nature of lurain that had been disproved: surface was not composed of hard rock; it was not composed of one piece of very porous rock; it was not covered by a layer of loose dust either thick or thin; it was a finely granulated material with particles that cohered to each other but did not seem particularly attracted to spacecraft; it was heavy enough for man to walk and work on and for a properly designed spacecraft to land on; and it reflected accurate radar signal from surface, not from subsurface substance. Jaffe noted there were a few hazards to manned spacecraft, mostly from large rocks and possibility of sinkage, but emphasized data so far indicated surface was adequate for landing Apollo Lem.
There appeared to be two different types of rocks near surveyor i: one with pitted, spongy surface that appeared to be caused by molten rock that had cooled and from which gas had escaped; the other harder, smoother surfaced, and smaller grained.
surveyor i photographs were considered superior to U.S.S.R.’s luna ix results because (1) camera was higher so that horizon was 10 times farther away; (2) camera resolution was greater (down to l/50th of an inch); camera worked longer and took more photos under different light angles, surveyor i’s pictures of its own footpad had yielded data on surface and subsurface composition.

During June: NASA Deputy Administrator Robert C. Seamans, Jr., writing in Astronautics & Aeronautics, outlined choices in "potential manned-spaceflight missions of the next generation” and argued for taking up the preliminary options now. He selected what he called "three natural, potential targets” for major extensions of manned space flight. First of these he saw as "a spacefaring research and operations center in earth orbit,” described as a "large, permanent, manned space facility” that would "make possible whole new ranges of experiments, investigations, and operations.” Second choice was "the moon itself... following up the initial exploratory landings with a permanent lunar base.” Third objective could be "manned surface exploration of Mars” within context of "extension of the lunar-landing experience to the near planets.” Citing both advantages and difficulties of the latter, he said: "Such an effort would represent a greater national commitment of far longer duration than our commitment in 1961 to a manned lunar landing, and would generate proportionately increased industrial, university, and government activities. Significant advances in virtually every field of space-related technology would be required. The increase in scientific knowledge from direct, firsthand observation and experimentation on another planet, however, has not yet been measured against the direct cost of its achievement, or against the more subtle cost of longterm dedication to a given course of action, with its inherent loss of national flexibility in allocation of the limiting resources—technical and scientific manpower.” (A&A, 6/66, 30-33)

July 1: nasa successfully launched explorer xxxiii (Imp-D) Anchored Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (Aimp) from etr using Thrust-Augmented Delta booster with FW-4S 3rd stage to study interplanetary radiation and magnetic fields. Because tracking data indicated at 3:30 GET spacecraft was in excess-energy orbit, alternate mission plan was put into effect at 4:30 get: retrorocket was fired, injecting explorer xxxiii into elliptical earth orbit with 278,990-mi. (449,174-km.) apogee; 18,975-mi. (30,550-km.) perigee; 13.5-day period; 28.9° inclination. Planned parameters: 4,000-mi. (6,440-km.) apolune; 800-mi. (1,288km.) perilune; 10-hr. period; 175° inclination, nasa later revealed booster’s 2nd stage had produced 70-80 fps over-velocity which would have caused spacecraft to reach moon’s vicinity too early to achieve lunar capture. Despite explorer xxxiii’s failure to achieve lunar orbit, all active experiments were operative and high scientific yield was expected.
Fourth of seven Interplanetary Explorers planned by NASA and first to attempt lunar orbit, 206-lb. explorer xxxiii carried six scientific experiments and one engineering experiment—a solar cell damage study. Primary mission objectives were to study at lunar distances the earth’s magnetic tail and magnetosphere in interplanetary space twice a month by means of lunar anchored spacecraft; and to measure interplanetary magnetic fields, solar plasma, and energetic particles in cislunar space. Program was managed by gsfc under overall direction of NASA Office of Space Science and Applications (ossa), (nasa Proj. Off.; NASA Release 66-162; upi, NYT, 7/2/66, 5; Strothman, Wash.

Parin, a Soviet physician-scientist with a major role in selecting and training cosmonauts, told Technology Week in a Moscow interview. In phase one "we merely made objective observations of animals ... we were interested in just keeping them alive, in generating the atmosphere, maintaining thermal control, humidity, pressure, and the rest,” Parin said. "Now we want to know the intimate details of animal adaptation” to space, because lower animals could be more intensively studied in space flights than man. Parin cited four areas in which improved medical technology could aid the study of physiology: measuring calcium loss in astronauts; analyzing process of water loss in astronauts; measuring muscle tone; and devising better telemetry. Parin said he was satisfied with the interchange of space-medical data between U.S.S.R. and U.S. (Beller, Tech. Wk., 7/4/66, 12, 13)

July 5: nasa’s Apollo/Saturn AS-203 mission was successfully launched from Complex 37 down etr to obtain flight information on 2nd stage (S-IVB) and instrument unit (Iu), which reflected Saturn V configuration as nearly as possible. Two-stage Uprated Saturn I (Saturn IB) launch vehicle boosted unmanned payload composed of S-IVB stage, Iu, and nose cone into 117-mi.-altitude circular orbit (88.21-min. period, 31.94° inclination). S-IVB engine burned once in earth’s atmosphere and was shut down. Engine’s capability to restart after coast, as would be necessary during the Apollo mission, was demonstrated. No reignition was planned on this mission. Photos of liquid hydrogen fuel behavior were transmitted to four ground stations by one operable TV camera; attempts to repair malfunctioning second camera before launch had failed. During fourth orbit, while performing pressure differential test of S-IVB stage common bulkhead, internal pressure in the stage built up "well in excess of design values,” and the stage fragmented.
Initial evaluation of flight data indicated that all mission objectives were attained. Success of mission—second of three preliminary missions preceding first manned Apollo flight—was critical in meeting lunar exploration timetable. 58,500-lb.

July 6-21: nasa’s surveyor I, resting on the moon, revived and responded to signals from Tidbinbilla, Australia, tracking station after inactivity during two weeks of lunar night and one week of morning sunlight. Responding to command, spacecraft angled its solar panel toward sun to receive more operating power and began transmitting engineering data. Within a few hours after first response, it was declared "a fully operational spacecraft”; its battery was recharging; its transmitters, receivers, and command system were working; and machinery that moved its solar energy collector and high-gain antenna had been exercised. Performance amazed jpl officials who doubted spacecraft could survive the —260° cold of lunar night.
Spacecraft continued to perform satisfactorily for two days until rapid temperature rise in battery, apparently caused by short circuit, threatened to end spacecraft’s life. Temperature was rising at 3° per hour, and reached 141°F. Near-fatal temperature subsided by July 10 to 115°F and surveyor i later transmitted 257 photos—including pictures of a shattered glass mirror on metal box containing its battery. Box was insulated to maintain temperature between 40°C and 125°C; segments of mirrored glass helped radiate away heat produced when instruments were operating, jpl officials believed shattering was caused by combined stresses of heat at lunar noontime and cold during lunar night rather than by impact of meteorites or heat from inside compartment.
Unexpectedly long life of surveyor i ended July 14 after spacecraft transmitted 9 out of 10 photos commanded by Johannesburg tracking station to search for traces of lunar atmosphere that might scatter light from ring of gases erupting from the sun. JPL officially terminated mission July 21; spacecraft’s solar panels would be checked during next period of advantageous sunlight direction, around Aug. 2, to determine if surveyor i were transmitting again. Other checks would be made later to assure that spacecraft’s transmissions would not interfere with Surveyor B, scheduled for launch in fall 1966. (Miles, Wash.

•	Analysis of available evidence concerning possibility of an advanced form
of life on Mars by Univ. of Maryland astronomy professor Dr. Ernst J. Opik appeared in Science. Dr. Opik said the most heavily eroded craters visible in photos taken by mariner iv during the July 14, 1965, flyby dated from the earliest period of the planet’s history, implying that
Mars had never had a dense, moist, earth-like atmosphere for any extended period and would therefore be a poor prospect for life. Dr. Opik argued strongly for at least a primitive form of vegetation, citing in particular a region of 1.2 million sq. km. that had darkened rapidly from 1946 to 1954. He likened this to the change a distant observer would have seen on earth as a consequence of the virgin lands development program in U.S.S.R. Vegetation was the best explanation for such changes; however, if it were not vegetation, "it must be something specifically Martian.” The planet, he added, "may become a source of great surprises in the future.” (Science, 7/15/66, 255-65)

July 18-21: gemini x rendezvous and docking mission—eighth manned flight in Gemini series—touched on all aspects of mission objectives for which two-man spacecraft was designed. Mission began at etr’s Complex 14 with launch by Atlas booster of Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (Gatv), followed 100 min. later by launch from Complex 19 of Titan II booster orbiting gemini x spacecraft with Astronauts John W. Young as command pilot and Michael Collins as pilot, gatv x was placed in nearcircular orbit with 187-mi. (301-km.) apogee; 180-mi. (290-km.) perigee; and 90.5-min. period. The 8,248-lb. gemini x was launched into elliptical orbit with initial apogee of 167 mi. (268 km.) and 99-mi. (159-km.) perigee.
Maneuvers were executed as planned, with docking of gemini x and gatv x occurring at 5:58 get. Only about 380 lbs. maneuvering fuel of 940 lbs. at liftoff were left, whereas a 680-lb. remainder had been expected. An out-of-plane error had necessitated a major correction, with excessive fuel consumption. Mated spacecraft, using gatv x’s primary propulsion system, attained 476-mi. (766-km.) record altitude for manned flight. Burn of gatv x’s secondary propulsion system al 22:38 get brought docked configuration into same orbit as gatv viii—launched March 16 for gemini viii mission—preparatory to later rendezvous.
Standup Eva began at 23:27 get with Collins photographing stellar ultraviolet radiation through open hatch. Young ordered termination of Eva when both he and Collins experienced severe watering and irritation of eyes from an unidentified source. Separation of gemini x-gatv x— which had remained docked 38 min. 42 sec.—occurred at 44:40 get.
Series of maneuvers brought gemini x within 50 ft. of gatv viii. Umbilical Eva began at 48:08 get: Collins removed fairing from gatv viii and retrieved micrometeoroid detection experiment—completing first productive work ever accomplished on Eva mission. Collins lost Eva camera; photographic coverage was limited to pictures taken by Young from spacecraft. Eva was terminated after 28 min. to conserve maneuvering fuel; 50 lbs. had been used, as against 35 lbs. estimated consumption for planned 55 min.
Third hatch opening of mission occurred when astronauts, cramped by unstowed equipment, jettisoned 12 items.
Reentry July 21 after 70 hrs. 47 min. in space and 43 revolutions was normal. At 5:07 p.m. edt, gemini x splashed down in Atlantic Ocean 544 mi. east of Cape Kennedy—less than three miles off target and five miles from recovery ship U.S.S. Guadalcanal. Within minutes, usn pararescue team dropped from helicopters had attached flotation collar to spacecraft, and Young and Collins were transported by helicopter to recovery ship.
gemini x had accomplished (1) two rendezvous, one involving longest docking yet achieved, the other a close approach to a passive satellite from which an object was retrieved; (2) two Eva exercises; (3) successful maneuvering by astronaut from one spacecraft to another and back; and (4) use of powered, fueled satellite to provide primary and secondary propulsion for docked spacecraft, (nasa Release 66-179; NASA Proj.

Young and Michael Collins nasa Exceptional Service Medals for "outstanding contribution to space flight and engineering,” and the astronauts reviewed their July 18-21 mission for the press. Pilot Collins revealed that maneuvering difficulties during his walk in space had forced him to approach gatv vm three times before successfully retrieving a micrometeoroid experiment. He felt the "basic problem” in Eva was that "without some sort of handholds or restraining devices, a large percentage of the astronaut’s time is going to be devoted to torquing his body around until it is in the proper position to do some useful work.” Command Pilot Young said mission’s fuel shortage had been caused by large out-of-plane error, not human error as previously believed: "We had to use a brute force method of rendezvous [with gatv x].

• In reply to March 2 invitation by fcc to submit comments on whether or not private entities should be allowed to establish special-purpose communications satellite systems for domestic use, 18 organizations filed responses.
Ford Foundation proposed that consideration be given to formation of a nonprofit nationwide television system—operating under Broadcasters Nonprofit Satellite Service (bns)—which would carry an extensive schedule of educational programs financed by transmission of commercial TV programs. Foundation contended fcc had power to authorize such a satellite system and that the act creating ComSatCorp had anticipated additional systems to meet unique national needs.
ComSatCorp filed brief saying there was no legal basis for authorizing private organizations to establish special-purpose communications satellite systems for domestic use and that it would be in the public interest to assign ComSatCorp a monopoly on all such systems. Opinion was accompanied by full technical proposal for multi-use, high-capacity, four-satellite system for domestic distribution of TV, voice, and data signals that would be operational by 1970 at estimated cost of between $110 and $126 million.
at&t argued it would be against "expressed national policy” to authorize satellite systems outside the framework of commercial communications carriers and urged fcc “to conclude in this finding that there can be no authorization of private satellite systems.”
Carnegie Commission on Educational Television said it was encouraging a study of a comsat system that would be specifically designed for noncommercial television. While conceding that national satellites might be advantageous in some cases, Carnegie Commission warned that such a system presented problems of "educational monopoly and centralized control of instructional and other material.” fcc was requested to take no definitive action until Carnegie’s forthcoming report on educational television was published in late 1966 or early
1967- . .
Briefs of broadcasting industry cited urgency for domestic satellite
service to cut costs of distributing television and radio programs. This cost reduction for the three networks—cbs, abc, and nbc—was estimated at approximately $50 million a year, nbc said a determination as to how this satellite service should be obtained could not be made in the abstract but "would depend on ... a comparison of the respective merits of specific proposals.”
National Assn, of Manufacturers told fcc that manufacturing community should have full freedom of choice either to lease channels from ComSatCorp directly or establish private systems. (CR, 8/2/66, 17131-3; Gould, NYT, 8/2/66, 1, 18; Av. Wk., 8/8/66, 27-8)

August 6-23: 25th anniversary of first U.S. manned rocket-assisted aircraft flights made by Homer A. Boushey, then Capt., USA Air Corps, in Ercoupe monoplane specially fitted with jet-assisted takeoff (Jato) units “to determine if military aircraft could use rockets to get into the air faster from short runways with heavy payloads.” During Jato test series, conducted by USA Air Corps from March Field, Calif., under direction of the late Dr. Theodore von Karman, Boushey made: two takeoffs with Ercoupe on rocket power alone; 11 takeoffs combining rocket and aircraft power; and four flights in which rockets were fired while airplane was at altitude. On Aug. 6, he first flew on rocket power; on Aug. 12, he made first rocket-assisted takeoff; and on Aug. 23 he made two takeoffs on rocket power alone. Three rockets under each of Ercoupe’s wings produced total thrust of 168 lb. for 12 sec. Von Karman’s group formed company now known as Aerojet-General Corp. to manufacture Jato units. (Tech.

August 7: New “self-healing” solar cell believed at least 50 times more radiation resistant than conventional power supply cells had been developed by rca for gsfc. Unlike previous cells which were made of silicon and protected by transparent shields of quartz or sapphire, new
cells contained small lithium additive which sealed gaps produced by bombardment of high-energy radioactive particles and reduced weight of shielding by up to 90%. gsfc physicist Milton Schach described the new cell as a "major accomplishment” and predicted its use would permit flights of over 1,000 days through center of Van Allen radiation belts. Applications were also foreseen for communications satellites, high-altitude military reconnaissance spacecraft, and missions to Jupiter, surrounded by high-energy electron radiation belt.

•	Hughes Aircraft Co. engineer’s smuggling of a small U.S. flag on nasa’s
surveyor i spacecraft which softlanded on the moon June 2 was a breach of discipline and a violation of international space policy, wrote Joshua Lederberg in the Washington Post. ". . . NASA policy requires 'minimum contamination’ so that the moon can remain a useful preserve for the detection of any life that might be transported by, say, meteorites. This calls for 'clean room’ standards during the assembly of spacecraft components.
"A bootlegged flag which could not have been subjected to such control for decontamination is a clear violation of a policy to which this country’s honor has been attached and calls for strenuous disciplinary
measures to insure the integrity and credibility of purpose of our future exploratory missions.” (Lederberg, Wash. Post, 8/7/66)
August 7: French-Soviet June 30 agreement on space cooperation was arousing speculation about Soviet participation in French Guiana launch site, reported Richard Lewis in Chicago Sun Times. Use of large Soviet launch vehicles—which were also missiles—at French Guiana range would "open a missile corridor to the soft underbelly of the United States early warning system,” and "undoubtedly generate serious tension in the Western world and in Europe,” Lewis suggested. But French restriction that all satellites launched from site use French boosters and crew "would make the Guiana port useless to the Russians for space research, since the only space launcher the French have developed is the Diamant” whose payload capability was equivalent to that of the Scout—smallest booster in U.S. inventory.

August 10: NASA’s lunar orbiter I (Lunar Orbiter A) unmanned spacecraft was successfully launched by Atlas-Agena D booster from etr in first
U.S. attempt to orbit the moon and photograph possible landing sites for Apollo astronauts [see Aug. 14-31].
Agena 2nd stage fired to boost 850-lb. spacecraft into 100-mi. (161km.) altitude parking orbit, reignited after 28-min. coast period, injecting spacecraft into 90-hr. translunar trajectory, and separated. On schedule, lunar orbiter i deployed its four solar panels and two antennas and locked its five solar sensors on the sun. Only difficulty occurred when spacecraft’s startracker failed to lock on Canopus and flight engineers were forced to lock it on the moon—-a weaker navigational reference point. Assistant Project Manager James S. Martin, Jr., of LaRC was "still quite confident” about achieving lunar orbit, but noted
it might be more difficult to obtain desired precision and exact positions required for optimum photos of lunar surface. At approximately 00:28 GMT Aug. 11 planned midcourse maneuver was successfully executed, and jpl scientists predicted spacecraft would miss original aiming point by only 50 mi.
Primary objectives of NASA’s lunar orbiter i mission, first in series of five, were (1) to place three-axis stabilized spacecraft into lunar orbit; and (2) obtain high-resolution photos of various types of lunar surface to assess their suitability as landing sites for Apollo and Surveyor spacecraft and improve knowledge of the moon. Photos would cover 3,000mi. strip along moon’s equator, concentrating on nine potential landing areas. Spacecraft would also attempt to photograph surveyor i landing sites; provide precision trajectory information; and monitor meteoroids and radiation intensity in lunar environment. Lunar Orbiter program was managed by LaRC under direction of NASA’s Office of Space Science and Applications.

August 14-30: NASA’s photographic spacecraft lunar orbiter i became first U.S. spacecraft to enter lunar orbit—only 15 mi. off target—after 92-hr., 236,319-mi. flight from etr. Orbital parameters: apolune, 1,152 mi. (1,854 km.); perilune, 119 mi. (192 km.); period, 3 hrs. 37 min.; inclination, 12°. jpl reported drop in spacecraft’s apolune Aug. 17 to 1,150 mi. (1,851 km.), and rise in perilune to 126 mi. (202.8 km.); moon’s gravitational field was considered cause of orbital variations. After taking engineering photos transmitted to jpl Aug. 18-20, spacecraft was injected into close-in orbit by retrothrust maneuver initiated Aug. 21 for medium- and high-resolution photography of lurain. Tracking experts said 36-mi. (58-km.) perilune was "within a city block” of where it should be.
Spacecraft’s cameras had exposed 211 dual frames of film to photograph nine potential Apollo and Surveyor landing sites during mission’s photo acquisition phase, announced complete on Aug. 30. Readout was expected to be completed by Sept. 15. Medium-resolution camera returned good images; however, except for an excellent photo of moon’s far side, all exposures made with the high-resolution camera were disappointing. Camera’s malfunction was attributed Aug. 25 to spurious signal generated by spacecraft’s film transfer motor at 31-mi. perilune. Signal was tripping high-resolution camera shutter and causing film smear; lunar orbiter i’s perilune was lowered to 23 mi. (37 km.) to eliminate signal. Unprogramed photograph of earth, commanded Aug. 23 and received at NASA’s tracking station at Robledo de Chavela, Spain, Aug. 25, showed appearance of earth’s terminator—line dividing sunlit and shadowed portion of planet—from distance of about 240,000 mi.

August 17-18: Senate Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Communications held hearings concerning Ford Foundation’s Aug. 1 proposal to fcc to create a nonprofit domestic satellite system which would carry “an extensive schedule” of educational television programs financed by transmission of commercial TV programs.
Ford Foundation president McGeorge Bundy said that although the use of profits from a commercial business to finance a noncommercial undertaking might be novel to television, creation of a special carrier service in the public interest was not without precedent. He cited the Government’s granting of special mailing privileges to newspapers and magazines. Bundy disclosed the Ford Foundation was planning to arrange "a series of meetings in various parts of the country with potential users of a noncommercial satellite system.”
Fred W. Friendly, TV consultant to Bundy, described what he said was the underlying irony of modem TV: commercial networks had the money to do qualitative public service but lacked sufficient time on the air, while educational TV had the time but lacked the money.
ComSatCorp chairman James McCormack said the heart of the Ford proposal called for the "funneling of savings” that might be enjoyed by commercial communications carriers into support of a cultural undertaking. While acknowledging the value of educational TV, McCormack said he felt only Congress could rule whether one segment of a diversified society could be compelled to support another segment without benefit of specific legislation to that end.
AT&T vice president Richard Hough, itt executive Bertram B. Tower, and Western Union Telegraph Co. vice president Earl D. Hilburn challenged the proposal saying that any such communications system should adhere to the common carrier principle of serving all users rather than any particular group such as broadcasters. While these witnesses supported the objective, they questioned the feasibility of the plan on economic and technical grounds. Tower suggested that consideration be given to permitting special rates for educational TV services through existing common carriers. Hilburn said that rate adjustments in favor of educational broadcasters might be authorized if some form of subsidy were determined to be in the national interest.
Sen. John O. Pastore (D-R.I.), who had called the hearings, said they were a "prelude” to action by fcc and noted that Congress almost certainly would want to explore the implications of the Ford proposal
as it related to a private corporation. Hearings were completed Aug. 23. (ComSatCorp Releases; Gould, NYT, 8/18/66, 59; Wash. Post, 8/18/66, A12; AP, Wash. Post, 8/19/66, A2)

•	nasa Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., told Space
Business Daily that nasa had presented several proposed FY 1968 budgets to bob, including one for "just over $6 billion” and another for $5.5 billion. He said that in the $5.5-billion budget about $500-$600 million would be for Apollo Applications (Aa); the $6-billion budget would include about $1 billion for Aa. Emphasizing that major funds for Aa must be included in the FY 1968 budget if the billions of dollars spent on Apollo technology were not to be wasted, he indicated that a budget of about $5 billion would end plans for an adequate Aa program to follow Project Apollo. He noted that under a $5-billion budget, there would be a greater percentage cut back in contractor operations as opposed to inhouse nasa efforts, but that with a $5.5-billion budget the current ratio would remain about the same. Seamans confirmed that the first manned Apollo lunar landing could come as early as 1968, but said it is "most likely” to occur in 1969. (SBD, 8/29/66, 317-8)

"In a few years pictures of the earth’s orb as seen from distant space will become commonplace. Tomorrow’s schoolchildren will find it hard to believe there was a time when no human eyes had seen the full crescent arc of earth’s globe from the perspective of the moon or beyond.”
Philadelphia Evening Bulletin: "Looking rather like a crumbly piece of Roquefort, there it was—Earth, as seen from the Moon by a camera aboard Lunar Orbiter 1. The picture was a black-and-white, but no matter. Since the Moon has no appreciable atmosphere, Earth will never take on the bright orange and yellow hues of a harvest moon. And since there are no forests, no lakes, no oceans, no snowcovered fields on the Moon, Earth will never be framed, for lunar lovers, in the sylvan or aquatic settings that lend so much enchantment and mystery to earthly views of the Moon.”

September 9: Validity of satellite measurements of micrometeoroid fluxes in which piezoelectric microphones had been used as detectors was challenged in Science by Carl Nilsson, Australian scientist working at gsfc. Although these measurements had given rise to theory that
earth was surrounded by dust cloud, analysis of 100 hrs. of data from NASA’s ogo ii satellite revealed: (1) there had been no detectable signals from sensors that could have been caused by micrometeoroid impact; and (2) the microphone systems had been emitting noise. Nilsson concluded that in past satellite measurements, microphone noises had not been caused by micrometeoroid impact but by reaction of microphone crystals to temperature changes.

September 12-15: Three-day gemini xi mission—ninth manned flight in NASA’s Gemini series—began with launch of Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (gatv) by Atlas booster from etk’s Complex 14, followed 97 min. later by launch of gemini xi by Titan II booster from Complex 19. Astronauts were Charles Conrad, Jr., command pilot, and Richard F. Gordon, Jr., pilot, gatv entered near-circular, 185-mi.-altitude orbit; gemini xi entered elliptical orbit with 175-mi. (280-km.) apogee; 100-mi. (161-km.) perigee; 90-min. period; and 33° inclination, gemini xi docked with gatv 94 min. after liftoff to become first manned spacecraft to achieve first-revolution rendezvous and docking—mission’s primary objective. Other accomplishments included extravehicular activity (Eva), maneuvering of docked gemini xi-gatv configuration to record
851-mi. altitude, station-keeping using tether to link two spacecraft, computer-controlled reentry, and completion of several experiments.
After initial docking, crew executed four practice docks and spent sleep period attached to gatv. Gordon began planned 107-min. Eva on schedule at 23:58 get, but ten minutes later, after setting up movie camera, retrieving micrometeoroid experiment, and attaching Agena’s 100-ft. tether to gemini xi’s docking bar, had to rest astride gatv. When blinded in his right eye by perspiration, Gordon was ordered by Conrad at 24:02 get to cancel power-tool evaluation experiment and return to cabin.
At 40:58 get, following crew’s second sleep period, mated spacecraft used gatv’s primary propulsion system (pps) to attain orbit with 851-mi. apogee—record altitude for manned space flight. After two revolutions, second pps burn restored docked configuration to approximately 185-mi.-altitude circular orbit. At 46:58 get Gordon opened hatch to begin 2 hr. 8 min. standup Eva during which several photographic experiments were conducted. Tether dynamics exercise followed: gemini xi undocked from gatv and moved to end of 100-ft. tether which was supposed to hold two spacecraft on vertical line pointing earthward, proving that two objects could fly in formation for long duration without using maneuvering fuel. When vehicles began to drift, Conrad initiated slow rotation with appropriate spacecraft maneuvers, creating slight centrifugal force which kept tether taut and spacecraft at controlled distance. After separation from Agena during sleep period, Conrad executed successful re-rendezvous—added to flight plan because of gemini xi’s favorable fuel supply.
Reentry Sept. 15 in 45th revolution after 71 hrs. 17 min. of flight was first in U.S. space program to be guided automatically by computer which fed commands directly to thrusters. Splashdown of gemini xi in the Atlantic 700 mi. from Cape Kennedy—within two miles of target— and recovery operations by crew of U.S.S.

September 13-14: First Logistics Management Symposium attended by some 400 industrialists and government officials met at msfc to discuss logistics support of activities in the free world and in space. In the keynote address, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller stressed that effective logistics management was essential to the success of NASA’s Apollo program. "For the first time in
a NASA manned space flight program, the greater part of logistics is not being provided by the Department of Defense. . . .
"However, the need for increasing the emphasis on logistics management for Apollo is great. . . .
"The Apollo Saturn space vehicle involves 20,000 contractors and subcontractors and has more than 900,000 individual parts. The Saturn V first stage holds 56 tank cars of propellants. The second and third stages of Saturn V transported by water during the Apollo program will spend a total of 700 days at sea. Apollo program transportation by all modes will require coordination with nine Government agencies. The launch windows for the Apollo lunar mission are relatively small, malfunctions on the pad must be kept to a minimum while corrective maintenance must be extremely fast and reliable. All of these elements make the Apollo logistics program both complicated and costly. . . .” (msfc Release 66-202; Text)

September 20-22: NASA’s 2,204-lb. surveyor ii (Surveyor B) was successfully launched from etr’s Complex 36 at 8:32 a.m. edt. After excellent injection by Atlas-Centaur (AC-7) launch vehicle on trajectory toward moon’s Sinus Medii, spacecraft successfully accomplished all required sequences up to midcourse maneuver. Initiated at 1:00 a.m. edt Sept. 21, the 9.8-sec. thrust phase was unsuccessful because one of three vernier engines failed to ignite, which caused spacecraft to tumble at about 1 rps. Thirty-nine additional attempts were made to start all three engines. In all cases, the same two engines ignited; the third did not.
jpl engineers, uncertain of cause of malfunction, speculated it might be result of stuck valve or insufficient power to operate engine’s triggering mechanism. They said unless it was corrected, surveyor ii could not softland since all three vernier engines were needed to stabilize spacecraft during decelerating descent to lunar surface.
On Sept. 22, when it became apparent the mission could not be completed, engineering experiments were performed to obtain as much data as possible on spacecraft performance.

•	Comparing earth to a "manned spaceship hurtling through the infinity of
space,” Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey said in address at San Fernando State College that exploration of space would bring home the fact that "earth is a mere speck in the universe.” He said it would seem increasingly absurd we had not better organized our living together on this planet: "Our experience in space can be a powerful stimulus to all of us, wherever we live, to move towards a world of law, a world without war. And may we find also in the space effort that 'moral equivalent of war’ for which philosophers have been searching over many centuries. Like war, it stretches our human capabilities to the utmost. It demands all that we possess of ingenuity, determination, persistence, and intelligence—and, on the part of our gallant astronauts, the highest degree of courage and resourcefulness in the face of danger. Space activities —even competition in space—can be a substitute for aggression, a bridge for mutual understanding and the identification of common interests with other nations, and a major tool of arms control and disarmament.” (Text)

• Space negotiations played important roie in visit of West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard to U.S. Following discussions with President Johnson, joint statement was released from White House: "The President and the Chancellor discussed possibilities for increased cooperation in technology and science and in particular in the field of space research. The Chancellor expressed his satisfaction that effective steps toward increased cooperation in space research have been initiated since his last meeting with the President in December 1965. The President and the Chancellor welcomed the decision to expand the present cooperative satellite program reached as a result of the recent discussions in Bonn between NASA Administrator Webb and Minister of Science Stoltenberg.
"The President and the Chancellor agreed that scientific cooperation should be pressed forward for the mutual benefit of both countries and the advancement of human knowledge, preserving opportunities for additional nations to participate and contribute.”
President Johnson and Chancellor Erhard, accompanied by NASA Administrator James E. Webb and Secretary of Defense Robert S.

During September: Vice President Hubert Humphrey, in an interview with Technology Week, predicted that U.S. would land men on the moon in 1969—probably before U.S.S.R. He said the Johnson Administration had definite plans for "very active post-Apollo schedule,” but refused to "put a time schedule on what comes next.” Post-Apollo activities would include exploring the moon, increasing our knowledge of the
planets, expanding earth-orbiting capability, both manned and unmanned, and developing maneuverable, reusable spacecraft. The Vice President foresaw no possibility of merging usaf’s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol) program with any of nasa’s manned projects. (Tech. Wk., 9/5/66, 12, 13)
During September: U.S. and U.S.S.R. were exchanging daily six to eight weather satellite photographs with nephanalyses. First U.S. transmittal began Sept. 6 with pictures from essa i meteorological satellite, launched Feb. 3. On Sept. 11, U.S.S.R. began sending pictures from cosmos cxxii, launched June 25. Regions photographed—primarily Atlantic Ocean and Western Europe-—had been matched so operations of satellite systems could be compared. Joint effort to improve transmission quality had been proposed since transmission seemed to degrade photographs: U.S. scientists found Soviet photos "poor” in quality; Soviet scientists described U.S. photos as "usable.”
Receipt of photos from cosmos cxxii had enabled U.S. to analyze satellite’s instrumentation: cosmos cxxii carried pair of 48° TV cameras canted 16.5° to each side of orbital plane to provide coverage of about 690 mi. of earth. Cameras overlapped field of coverage by 1°; frames transmitted so far had 10 per cent overlap. (Av. Wk., 9/26/66, 26-7; Schmeck, NYT, 9/27/66, 15)

Much of the complex apparatus used in development of closed ecological systems for long manned space flights could be used in terrestrial housing, Fuller said. He envisioned enclosing the necessary machinery in a "little black box. . . . We are investing $7 billion in it. It weighs 500 pounds. We can probably mass-produce it for $2 a pound.
"That means we can give all the things they need foremost in a house —water, heat, cooling and waste regeneration—for $1000.

•	Press briefing was held at LaRC on results of nasa’s lunar orbiter i
mission, launched Aug. 10 from etr to orbit the moon and photograph possible landing sites for Apollo astronauts.
The more than 200 photos transmitted by the spacecraft revealed a rugged lunar landscape covered with thousands of craters. Ridges and hills were more gently sloped near moon’s center and became progressively smoother in the west. Presence of large rocks, or "blocks,” proved that surface was firm enough to support manned spacecraft. Of the nine sites photographed, the Ocean of Storms where surveyor i was resting appeared safest for manned landing. Classified as a dark mare— flat, waterless plain with relatively few craters—it had 20 per cent fewer craters than any of the other sites.
U.S. Geological Survey scientists Dr. Harold Masursky and Dr. Lawrence Rowan suggested that the photos showed evidence of volcanic activity. Citing a small cone-shaped hill on line of a geologic rift near surveyor i ana a large crater on the back of the moon, apparently filled with congealed lava, Dr. Masursky said: "The moon is not a cold, dead, lifeless planet. It looks close to being as dynamic as the earth.” Dr. Rowan noted that major faults on the lunar surface seemed to run in two general directions—northeast-southwest and southeast-northwest —and concluded that much of the volcanic activity probably occurred along these lines.
LaRC scientist William Michael said nonphotographic data on the satellite’s orbit indicated moon might turn flat side toward earth, not bulgy side as generally believed. He said displacement of moon’s center of mass toward earth could explain both a flat face and moon’s slight wobble, which had been accounted for previously by the "bulge” theory.
Micrometeoroid detection experiment had not recorded any "hits” during satellite’s eight weeks in lunar orbit in contrast to earth-orbiting satellites which often registered a hit every two weeks.
Project Manager Clifford H. Nelson announced that Lunar Orbiter B—second of five satellites in series—would be launched between Nov. 6 and 11 to photograph area slightly north of that scanned by lunar orbiter i.

Richard Johnston, Chief of msc Crew Systems Div., said that to work effectively in space, a future astronaut would require a more streamlined spacesuit, a better self-propulsion system, and an anchoring device such as "stable work platform which will permit his energies to be used in accomplishing the task and not in overcoming body instability.” He said that during extravehicular activity on NASA’s Gemini missions nearly 80 per cent of the astronauts’ energy had been expended to keep
still and avoid tumbling. Johnston also recommended further investigation of metabolic expenditures required to perform work in space: twice Gemini astronauts had been forced to return to their spacecraft, overheated and exhausted, after struggling with relatively simple tasks.

Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, presented a comprehensive review of NASA’s Gemini program and Dr. Charles A. Berry, Director of Medical Research and Operations at msc, gave a detailed biomedical report on the Gemini missions. Observations on the effects of spaceflight on man’s system had revealed significant changes involving only cardiovascular, hematopoietic, and musculoskeletal systems, but even these changes appeared to be adaptive in nature and were no cause for concern, Dr. Berry said. Results of a study on red blood cell loss during spaceflight were inconclusive, Dr. Berry reported; hyperoxia, lack of inert diluent gas, relative immobility of crew, dietary factors, and weightlessness were being examined as possible causes.

October 25-28: 75th anniversary convocation, "Scientific Progress and Human Values,” was held at Cal Tech. Dr. Lee A. DuBridge in welcoming address noted meeting represented "a time for self appraisal.. . . We at Cal Tech are seriously seeking to take a hard look at ourselves, at the world of science and technology of which we are part, and at the world of human beings who may either benefit or possibly suffer from what we do.”
nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller said that "through the creative use of the capabilities that we are building up, space may ... be used as one of many approaches to alleviate” problems of "famine, disease, over-population, and the need for more and better education” facing developing nations.
Dreams of eventual space travel were "pure fantasy,” according to Cal Tech astronautics professor Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein. He urged, however, that a greater portion of national expenditures be devoted to achieving interstellar communications—a task that "may ultimately become the greatest scientific adventure.”
Dr. Robert P. Sharp, professor of geology at Cal Tech, noted that although "earth scientists” were playing important role in national space program, it was also important that they "look downward into our own planet. . . . Our understanding of these distant bodies will depend to a good degree upon how well we understand our own plain earth.”
Likelihood that revolutionary improvement in communication on earth would transform society was suggested by John R. Pierce, research director of Bell Telephone Labs. Communications Sciences Div. Satellites would greatly expand potential of backward countries and would help build a sense of national identity in underdeveloped areas.
"Technology is moving faster than our ability to assimilate it,” scientist and industrialist Dr. Simon Ramo postulated. Dr. Ramo urged development of new class of men called "socio-technologists” who could "effectively link scientific developments with social betterment.”
Dr. Murray Gell-Mann, professor of theoretical physics at Cal Tech, said society must give new direction to technology, diverting it from applications that yield higher productive efficiency into areas that yielded greater human satisfaction. A symbol of this sort of change would occur when man no longer wanted to channel resources into "building bigger, noisier aircraft” or when society decided to divert a new highway around a virgin forest rather than build through it.

a "two-pronged effort by the part of our economy interested in the evolution of space products,” suggested Boeing Co. vice president George H. Stoner before aiaa Forum on "After Apollo, What Next?” in Washington, D.C.: ". . . industry must assist nasa and the federal government in formulating succeeding national space goals for the research that will produce fruitful progress toward understanding our universe and toward building a store of knowledge about specialized space techniques. . . . Industry and government agencies other than nasa must explore and continue to find ways to compete successfully in the world market place and in the international technological race on the large scale development projects that characterize our modern society. . . .” Stoner offered several specific suggestions for post-Apollo activities: (1) communications satellites that would take advantage of the natural access to anywhere on earth provided by spacecraft; (2) applications of space-based activities to ballistic missile defense; (3) expansion and refinement of equipment for survey of earth affairs from space; (4) dramatic reduction of launch costs; and (5) continuing exploration of space and its technologies by nasa astronauts and scientists to learn more about our universe.

•	Military should increase its interest in the Nation’s technological base
rather than rely so heavily on the civilian sector for basic and exploratory research, suggested William Coughlin in Technology Week. He noted the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol) program: ". . . . much of the technology on which this military effort is based was developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on programs deliberately tied to the peaceful uses of space. It is a fair question to ask where
a military space program would be today vis-a-vis the Soviet Union if the technological base had not been developed under nasa funding.
“Other areas of military importance have not been as fortunate because they lack a civilian counterpart. Steps must be taken to see that development of a technical base in these areas is not overlooked. It is not easy to justify expenditure of manpower and funds in this somewhat invisible arena. . . .” (Coughlin, Tech. Wk., 11/14/66, 54)

November 16-18: National Conference on the Management of Aerospace Programs was held in Columbia, Mo.
NASA Apollo Program Director M/G Samuel C. Phillips (usaf), in report on "Management Scheme for Apollo,” concluded: "There is no single approach to program management that will guarantee success. The development of and experience with various management systems, techniques and tools in the past several years have contributed extensively to a more scientific approach. The 'art’ element remains, however. The integrated implementation of those concepts and their associated procedures and disciplines is sometimes confronted with considerable resistance within an organization. This has merit, for it forces management to thoroughly screen new concepts as to validity, feasibility and salability. Once a new management system is approved, however, it deserves and requires the personal support of the program director
through line channels to stimulate its overall implementation and acceptance at the grass roots level. . . .” (Text)
DeMarquis D.

November 27: Two propulsion developments emerging from engineering research might open Jupiter, the regions outside the solar system, and even the sun to closeup inspection during 1970s, said Dr. Homer Joe Stewart, manager of jpl’s Advanced Studies Office. Developments were use of planetary gravitational drag and solar-electric propulsion. When a spacecraft neared a planet, it would gain speed from gravitational pull. While traveling under planet’s gravitation attraction, it would pick up planet’s own sun-orbit speed. This, added to spacecraft’s momentum, would be enough to propel spacecraft past planet’s gravitational field and toward another planet. Travel between gravitational fields would be powered by spacecraft’s solar-electric system. Solar-electric propulsion would double useful payload for a Mars-orbiter mission, Dr. Stewart said, and it would offer the advantage of high specific impulse for a Jupiter flyby, (jpl Release; A&A, 12/66, 26-31)

•	U.S.S.R. was showing increasing signs of having conceded manned lunar
landing race to U.S. as part of vastly revamped space program, Donald C. Winston postulated in Aviation Week. Significance of new program was that it reflected emphasis Premier Alexey Kosygin had fomented in Soviet planning. Brezhnev and Kosygin, who came to power while three-man voskhod i was still in orbit in October 1964, ordered the spacecraft to earth prematurely as one of their first moves even before the overthrow of Nikita Khrushchev was made public. It was not long before Kosygin grounded the rest of the Voskhod series, which was to have continued with at least five launches through 1965. Only voskhod ii was permitted off the ground after Kosygin took power. The March 1965 mission was conducted because planning had reached an advanced stage by the time Khrushchev was ousted and because Cosmonaut A.A. Leonov’s Eva—first in history—had high propaganda value. Winston theorized that the new space philosophy could produce a much less complex manned circumlunar mission without landing within the next year. (Av. Wk, 11/28/66, 22)

November 29-December 2: aiaa’s Third Annual Meeting and Technical Display was held in Boston. In keynote address, nasc Executive Secretary Dr. Edward C. Welsh described the manned spaceflight program as the most successful technological feat ever undertaken by the Nation. Panel discussion followed on future of U.S. space program.
Dr. Gordon J. F. MacDonald, Institute for Defense Analyses, predicted that man would be needed in space primarily as a "repairman” for scientific instruments. "The science . . . will be carried out on the ground where enormous facilities for computing, analysis, and discussion are available.”
Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (usaf, Ret.) said emphasis on space activities should not be only on peaceful purposes but also on preservation of peace; this would inevitably require sending military men into space. With advances in technology, U.S. must convert from "throwaway” hardware concept to use of maneuverable reentry vehicles and recoverable boosters, he added.
This idea was echoed by nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller, who said: ". . . all of the hardware developed for future projects would reflect our concern over . . . greater cost effectiveness, through the development of reusable launch vehicles and reusable spacecraft.” Mueller said there would be manned space stations that could stay in orbit a year or longer but said there was no need for crews to stay aloft for such periods. A ferry vehicle would he used for resupply of both equipment and crew. He listed potential benefits of space technology in the next decade, describing air traffic control towers in space, direct-to-home international TV broadcasting systems, and possibilities for predicting and controlling the weather.
Rep. George P. Miller (D-Calif.) said one of the problems of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics—of which he was chair-
man—was educating the people of the Nation to the benefits of the space program. It was a difficult task, he said, to justify space expenditures against the costs of Vietnam, foreign aid, and Great Society projects. But, he insisted, "it is the translation of space technologies into useful benefits that is the overall value of the space program.” (Texts; aiaa Daily, 11/30/66, 1, 3; Wash. Eve. Star, 11/30/66, A7)
Results from NASA’s EXPLOBER xxxm had shown for first time that tail of earth’s magnetosphere "extends more than 75,000 miles beyond the orbit of the moon,” reported gsfc scientist Dr. Norman F. Ness. Findings were contrary to those of Soviet scientist Dolginov and colleagues who had reported they were unable to detect magnetospheric tail at lunar distances on basis of data obtained from luna x between April 3 and May 4, 1966. Ness suggested as reason for this that luna x data were probably obtained when spacecraft was near or within neutral sheet region of magnetosphere where very low magnetic fields would be expected, (gsfc Release 20-66)
In session on Future Large Subsonic Transports, John Borger of paa said problems in air transport industry "are Being created by the phenomenal growth rate of our business.” Since the growth rate showed no signs of slackening in the coming years, continued development and extensive use of large subsonic jet aircraft were not only desirable but essential. Borger pointed out that the engine for the Boeing 747— which would carry times more passengers than present intercontinental transports—was being developed with only commercial airlines as potential customers. This was the first time in air history that a new aircraft powerplant had been undertaken on this basis. Borger noted that a major requirement for the "jumbo jets” was that they be available at least 5 to 6 yrs. ahead of the proposed Sst so that initial development and operation costs could be recovered.
H.	F. Klump, general manager of cargo traffic and sales for Deutsche Lufthansa Airlines, sounded a warning about the subsonic jet aircraft’s cargo capacity: unless airports expanded their freight handling facilities enormously, they would not be able to handle volume of material "dumped on them.”
W. D. Perreault, program director for Lockheed 500—a giant commercial cargo aircraft for the 1970s—discussed evolution of the 500 from C-5A transport under development for usaf. After reviewing three proposed commercial versions of the aircraft, he said one of them "will provide for the first time a cargo plane with direct operating costs of less than 2/ per ton statute mile.” (aiaa Daily, 11/30/66, 1, 31; Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 11/29/66, A10)
Commenting on the report of the aiaa Launch Vehicle and Missile Technical Committee, "The Next Generation of Launch Vehicles—• Evolution or Bold Step?” N. E. Golovin of the Office of Science and Technology said: ". . . if a family of reusable boosters is to be developed for reasons of economy then development cost per booster must he so low that economical amortization must be possible over a relatively small number of flights for each type; or, if only a single reusable booster is to be developed its use must indeed be so cheap that it would pay to employ it for payloads which are but a small fraction of its orbiting capacity. This reasoning . . . casts considerable doubt on the Committee’s suggestion that a 'bold step’ leading to the development of reusable boosters is justified at this time.” (Text)
NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Edgar M. Cortright, participating in a panel discussion on "Do We Need New Propulsion Systems for Lunar and Planetary Flight?”, concluded that unmanned missions during the next ten years would probably "not require either new propulsion systems or new launch vehicle stages. They probably will require adding a modified Centaur as an upper stage on the Saturn IB or the Titan IIIC. They may require and certainly could use a 260 inch solid first stage under the S-IV-B Centaur. . . .” Cortright recommended that current launch capability be put "to effective use in exploring space and in developing practical applications of space flight.” (Text)
During panel on -Space and Public Policy, "poor communications” between scientists and the general public was suggested reason for death of Project Mohole—killed by Congress because it would have cost at least three times the original estimate, nas president Frederick Seitz said such escalations in cost were "not unusual” for such scientific ventures and revealed the project would soon be renewed under a different name such as "deep ocean drilling.”
"The goals of space exploration are primarily those of science, not technology,” asserted panelist Hunter Dupree, science historian and history professor at Univ. of California, Berkeley. Chairman of the President’s Science Advisory Committee’s Panel on Space Science Louis Branscomb replied that no one wanted to see the space program purely as a "spectator sport,” and that space programs should be conceived to "maximize their scientific returns.” Commenting on the same subject, NASA Deputy Administrator Robert C. Seamans, Jr., said: "We must grapple with the problem of what we will do with the moon. This is not an esoteric problem.” Concerned about the lack of aiaa advice to Congress on questions of scientific policy, Rep. Emilio Q. Daddario (D-Conn.), member of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said the loudest critics of the space program were scientists in other disciplines eying the space money. "I call on aiaa to come to Congress with a sharpened viewpoint. You can speak with the consensus of
35,000	members.”
Avco Corp. vice president Arthur Kantrowitz feared that "aiaa is not equipped” to do the suggested job because unanimity within the society could not be achieved on policy questions. And unless it could, the assignment "would induce strains within aiaa and change its complexion.” (aiaa Daily, 12/2/66, 1, 29)

"Unless the space program serves people in a useful way, it will be transitory and fade into history as a curiosity. It will not even be enough for the program to serve people by measuring interesting scientific data. It must eventually serve the masses of people of the Earth, if it is to command substantial resources.” Communications, geodetic, navigation, and meteorological satellites, and other satellites designed to study and manage the world’s natural resources could, in Bisplinghoff’s estimation, contribute to meeting man’s needs, but international cooperation would be essential.

Benefits in medical, industrial, and other fields added dimensions to space program far beyond the value of the lunar-landing program alone, he said. (Transcript; Janson, NYT, 12/6/66, C34)
December 5: Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, commented on national impact of U.S. space program in a speech before arcs (Achievement Rewards for College Scientists) Foundation in Los Angeles: "Space exploration in its broadest meaning and in all of its ramifications has become a powerful force . . . socially, economically, politically, and even morally. ... It is the creator of new technologies, new techniques, and new methods of management. It has great significance for our national security. It is a stimulus for our economic and national growth. It is a catalyst to the achievement of the goals of our society. And it provides us with the dimensions of a great challenge—to explore space for the benefit of all mankind.” (Text)

December 6-7: NASA’s ATS i (Ats-B), first satellite in Applications Technology Satellite (Ats) program, was successfully launched from etr by Allas-
Agena D booster into elliptical transfer orbit with 22,831-mi. (36,758km.) apogee; 114-mi. (183-km.) perigee; 650-min. period; and 31° inclination. At 16:30 get, apogee motor was fired to place satellite into near-synchronous 22,300-mi.-altitude orbit. It would be allowed to drift 12 days to stationary position over the Pacific at 151° west longitude.
One of the most versatile satellites ever developed, 775-lb. ATS I carried 15 communications, technology, and scientific experiments, including camera systems for cloud-cover photos; two-way vhf transponder for voice communications between ground stations and aircraft in flight; electronically despun antenna to continuously direct a radio beam toward earth; and low-thrust resistojet which produced thrust of 450 millionths of a pound. Capable of multiple-access communications, satellite would be able to transmit TV and voice communications among stations in North America, Asia, and Australia. It would also be used to send weather data from essa facility at Suitland, Md., to Automatic Picture Transmission (Apt) stations in U.S., Japan, and Australia. Mission objectives were to inject spacecraft into synchronous orbit and place it on station; operate spacecraft for at least 30 days; and conduct experiments.

•	Complexities of modern society required a new concept of management,
nasa Administrator James E. Webb told graduation class of Harvard Univ.’s Graduate School of Business Administration. "The kind of challenges that we in management are facing today . . . call for new and experimental approaches to organization. One ... is the question of the chief executive function. In traditional thinking, the structure of an organization peaked in the chief executive. . . . However, as organizations have become more complex and their challenges more interdisciplinary . . . there has been an increasing tendency to experiment with the idea of the multiple executive. ... We saw this kind of need at the very beginning of nasa’s history. We evolved, therefore, a partnership arrangement which included Dr. Hugh Dryden, Dr. Robert Seamans, and myself. We all had many common ideas, and yet each brought to our work on the critical decisions affecting the nation’s space effort certain specialized experience. To do it any other way would have deprived us of the kind of mutual support and broadly-based leadership that I think we achieved.” (Text)

of NASA Apollo Spacecraft Office at msc, said nasa hoped to launch three manned Apollo missions in 1967 involving "essentially every test that needs to get done in order to insure that the lunar operation is proper.” He outlined the flights: (1) AS-204—three-man, earth-orbital mission of up to 14 days to check out crew, spacecraft, and ground equipment; (2) AS-205/208—10- to 12-day flight in which Uprated Saturn I boosters would launch an Apollo spacecraft with three-man crew and an unmanned Lunar Module (Lm) on successive days for rendezvous mission; and (3) AS-503—full-duration lunar mission rehearsal in earth orbit in which single Saturn V would launch manned Apollo spacecraft and Lm. Shea warned against undue optimism about a manned lunar landing in 1968. "It is literally true that there is no
planned date at the present time for the lunar operation . . . and I don’t see how there can be until we have had hardware in orbit to understand what vestigial problems still remain.”

December 24-31: U.S.S.R. achieved her second soft-landing on the moon when luna xiii spacecraft landed an instrument package near Ocean of Storms to photograph and test the lunar surface.
Landing sequence began when spacecraft was oriented vertically to the moon. At 43-mi. (69-km.) altitude, radar system aimed at lunar surface and turned on retrorocket, and shock-absorbing system was prepared. Less than one second before impact, after spacecraft had been slowed to 18 mph, instrument capsule was ejected and softlanded. Four minutes later, its petal-like covering opened, its antenna opened, and radio transmissions began.
18 hrs. after touchdown, luna xiii began photographing a panorama of the moon’s surface. Pictures showed barren, heavily pitted landscape littered with stones ranging upward in size from one inch, which Soviet scientists concluded had resulted from either volcanic eruptions or impacting meteoroids. There was no evidence of a thick layer of dust.
In addition to photographic equipment, spacecraft also carried two mechanical manipulators to test firmness and density of lunar soil: (1) a rod which was driven into surface with specific force; and (2) a meter which measured soil’s resistance to radiation. Analysis of data indicated that lunar surface could bear manned spacecraft and that soil from 8- to 12-in. depth was similar to medium-density terrestrial soil. Also onboard were a dynograph which tested firmness of lunar surface by recording duration and force of impact impulse, and a radiation meter which revealed that moon’s surface reflected about 25 per cent of electrically-charged particles which struck it.
Tass commented on luna xm’s successful mission: "There is no doubt now that it is these cosmic stations that can supply the information permitting a new approach to solve such important problems of science as the origin of the solar system, the origin and development of life on other planets, and the internal structure of celestial bodies.” (NYT, 12/25/66, 1, 40; 12/26/66, 19; 12/31/66, 6; AP, Wash.

Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, U.S. Geological Survey, said NASA’s lunar orbiter I photos had revealed “mass wasting” on the moon—a process similar to "downhill creep” which produced slopes of fragmented dirt and rock debris on earth. Accelerated by small local earthquakes caused by impacting meteorites, wasting process was rapidly covering all of moon’s small craters, Shoemaker said. He believed majority of lunar craters were caused by high-velocity explosive impacts of meteorites.

More than 300 meteorological sounding rockets and 100 scientific sounding rockets were launched. A total of 20 flights of the X-15 research aircraft were conducted; X-15 No. 2 piloted by Maj. William J. Knight set a new record speed of 4,233 mph (mach 6.33). nasa-usaf flight research investigating sonic booms got underway in six flights with XB-70 aircraft; research for the U.S. supersonic transport program continued. M2-F2 lifting-body vehicle made 14 unpowered flights, and HL-10 lifting body made its first flight.
Among the highlights in propulsion technology was static test firing of the 260-in.-dia. solid-propellant rocket motor, producing 3.5 million lbs. of thrust. Two test series of Nerva nuclear reactors were conducted. One, in 110 min. of power operation, demonstrated stability and controllability of the hot-bleed cycle nuclear rocket engine. The other involved first successful full-power operation and a restart operation, ending the program with an accumulation of more than 105 min. of reactor operation at full or near-full power.
usaf flight tested its powerful Titan III booster and used it to orbit the first seven Idcsp satellites of an eventual worldwide military comsat system.
Of the 43 Soviet payloads, 34 were Cosmos satellites and five, Luna spacecraft. Notable among these were cosmos cx, orbiting two dogs for prolonged period; cosmos cxxii, apparently first Soviet weather satellite; luna ix, achieving first soft-landing on the moon; and luna x, achieving first orbit of the moon. Also orbited were two molniya i comsats and the 12-ton proton hi unmanned spacecraft used for cosmic-ray research; Yantar I ion-engine payload was flown in suborbital spaceflight test.
France orbited her first instrumented scientific satellite, diapason i, the second satellite built and launched by France, (nasa Release 66-319; Major NASA Launches; nasc; Tass; U.S. Aeron. & Space Act., 1966, passim; A&A 1966, passim)
During 1966: International space events were highlighted by the U.N.’s agreement on a space treaty to govern "activities of states in the explora-
tion and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies.” The draft treaty—suggested by President Johnson May 7—was negotiatedby the Legal Subcommittee of theU.N. Committee onthePeace-ful Uses of Outer Space. On December 19 the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution endorsing the treaty, subject to ratification by five nations including U.S., U.S.S.R., and U.K.
By the end of 1966, 72 countries had cooperated with the U.S. in space research activities.
Six countries joined the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (Intelsat), bringing the total membership to 54.
France and U.S.S.R. entered into agreement on cooperative space research, including experiments in astronomy and communications. (U.S. Aeron. & Space Act., 1966, passim; A&A 1966, passim)
