January 1964
January 1: NASA position paper on dod’s Manned Orbiting Laboratory, embodying eight principles of NASA policy toward the mol, was made public. The paper stated:
“The dod Manned Orbital Laboratory is a single military project (a specific goal; not a broad program) within the overall National Space Program. . . .
“The mol should not be construed as the national space station, a separate program currently under joint study by NASA and the DOD. Such a space station project would be considered under the terms of the Webb/McNamara agreement on manned orbital research and development systems larger than Gemini and Apollo. The mol is, rather, a specific experimental test bed utilizing nasa’s Gemini project and the Titan III for certain potential military space applications not within the scope of NASA’s activities. . . .” (Text; Simons, Wash. Post, 1/2/64,1; A&A, 2/64,90; AF Mag., 74)
•	Head designer of Soviet spacecraft, name not identified, was interviewed in
Izvestia. His predictions for the next five years: “. . . permanently operating orbital stations consisting of sputniks having various purposes such as providing service in investigating the Earth, the Sun, forecasting weather, monitoring the radiation conditions in space, etc.; . . . an all-purpose radio and TV system for transmitting through space, with the aid of the so-called ‘hanging’ (‘stationary’) satellites; . . . ways of using space . . . for mail-freight deliveries, requiring high speed, and finally passenger service; . . . permanent orbiting stations [where] regular shifts of scientific workers of the most diversified specialties will live and work. ... In general, during this period flights into near space and return to Earth will become very commonplace. I think that in the next five years, many comrades will sojourn in space.”
Regarding “direct investigations in the region of the Moon and on its surface,” the designer said: “In all likelihood, in the imminent years such studies can be accomplished only with the aid of small automatic devices transmitting the data to Earth by radio.” (Izvestia, 1/1/64,1, atss-t Trans.)
•	Two mathematicians at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of Univ. of Calif.
achieved first accurate description of the orbit of Mars, Univ. of Calif, announced. The mathematicians, Joseph L. Brady and Edna Vienop, calculated the planet’s orbit with aid of computers used to develop nuclear weapons. Brady said calculation left Mercury as the solar system’s only planet without accurate description of its orbit. (AP, Wash. Post, 1/2/64, A3)
•	Beginning of cable circuit connecting New York and Offenbach, West Ger-
many, announced by Dr. Robert M. White, Chief of U.S. Weather Bureau, for exchange of meteorological information between North America and Europe. Inauguration of cable circuit, expected to yield improved
reception of weather data because of freedom from radio propagation occurring on radioteletypewriter circuit, represented major achievement in global exchange of weather information. International meteorological community now was planning for future exchanges using highspeed computers and communications satellites. (Commerce Dept. Release WB 64-1)
January 1: Fiftieth anniversary of first scheduled airline flight, from St. Petersburg to Tampa, Fla., by Benoist flying boat. Plane made two round-trip flights daily, six days per week across Tampa Bay. 18-mi. flights took 2 hrs. by steamer, 6 hrs. by car and 12 hrs. by rail.

January 2: NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, appearing on CBS radio program “Capitol Cloakroom,” said that before U.S. and U.S.S.R. could cooperate in a manned space flight effort, the U.S.S.R. would have to radically change its secrecy policy in space exploration. Some changes might be required in U.S. space policies also. “To conduct cooperative manned flights,” Dr. Dryden said, “I think you’d have to . . . start from the beginning with a joint team to consider all the problems together.” Regarding U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreements reached on weather satellites, communications satellites, and magnetic field studies, Dr. Dryden commented that “implementation of the agreements has been proceeding rather slowly. . . . We hope they’ll give us some clear indication as to whether they are ready to exchange cloud pictures in 1964, or not.”
Regarding Project Apollo timetable, Dr. Dryden said that if Congress supported the proposed budget for the project it should be possible to land a man on the moon by 1970. However, two year’s “slack” built into the schedule to allow for contingencies was lost by the FY 1964 budget reduction, (upi, N.Y. Her. Trib., 1/3/64; Wilson, Minneapolis Morning Trib., 1/3/64)

January 3: relay I communications satellite continued transmitting despite an onboard timer set to turn it off after one year. Electrolytic solution was supposed to have eaten through main power lead to switch off transmission power. NASA and rca experts speculated erosion was slowed because environmental temperatures were cooler than anticipated. Launched into orbit Dec. 13,1962, relay i has been used for 2,000 communications experiments with more than 290 hours of transmission time, most of which was wideband transmission or TV.

•	aec announced preliminary evaluation of mockup space reactor re-entry
flight (RFD-i), conducted May 22,1963, with a Scout booster, indicated that “space reactors can be designed to break apart and disintegrate when they re-enter the earth’s atmosphere.” During re-entry, telemetry recorded disassembly events and measured heating rates at critical points on the reactor “until blackout of radiofrequency occurred—just before disassembly of the reactor. The data on the temperature rises and the times of the disassembly events transmitted by the telemetry system were essentially as predicted.” Test results were still being evaluated by Sandia Corp. and Atomics International in an effort to substantiate the conclusions inferred from optical tracking of re-entry.

•	Seven noctilucent clouds visible in southwest U.S. in past six months
probably were caused by pmr rocket launchings, according to Dr. Aden B. Meinel and Carolyn P. Meinel in Science magazine. The Meinels, astronomers at Univ. of Arizona’s Stewart Observatory (Tucson), described cloud appearing Nov. 2 at mean altitude of 35 mi. By measuring speed and direction of cloud’s drift, Meinels traced it back
to vicinity of pmr, j ust as they had traced 44-mi. altitude cloud of June 15. Dr. Meinel and colleagues had described the clouds in Science last September, tentatively linking the June 15 cloud to Scout launching at pmr. Now, despite fact that no firing was announced for Nov. 2, Meinels concluded that “the coincidence of the clouds of June 15 and 2 November 1963 with a drift vector indicating origin from the Pacific Missile Range would appear to remove the probability of a fortuitous occurrence that could be argued from one cloud alone.” (Science, 1/3/64, CSM, 1/6/64)	_

January 7: In keynote address to 10th National Symposium on Reliability and Quality Control, Lt. Gen. Howell M. Estes, Jr. (USAF), afsc Vice Commander, reviewed the reasons for reliability in missile and space systems and specific measures taken by AFSC to improve reliability and quality control. Discussing space systems he said: “. . . Payload weight will always be a major factor in the systems effectiveness equation for space systems. In unmanned systems, redundancy can never be acceptable but only reluctantly tolerated. Even in manned space systems, any provisions for in-flight maintenance or replacement of components will reduce payload weight which might otherwise be available for more productive use. Our greatest challenge thus lies in space. . . .” (Text, afsc Release 41-R—4)

•	Dr. Edward C. Welsh, nasc Executive Secretary and Acting Chairman,
spoke at lOlli National Symposium on Reliability and Quality Control on misconceptions about national space policy:
“First, the lunar project should not be confused with our total space effort. Of course, it is a complex, expensive, and difficult task, but it’s just a part of our young and growing national space program. Its major significance is that it sets a goal for an orderly development of competences—all of which will be useful for a wide range of space activities in the future.
“Second, the national security aspects of space are not being neglected. The National Aeronautics and Space Act requires that they receive attention and they are receiving it. Careless thinking prompts critics to assert that practically nothing is being done by the military in the space field. For example, about two-thirds of all our space flights in the past two years have been launched by the Department of Defense. And just as careless thinking assumes that a larger space budget for NASA than for Defense means a neglect of the latter. While one need not be satisfied with the rate of progress in either the civilian or non-civilian aspects of space, nevertheless it is worth noting that national security objectives are being pursued by both nasa and the Defense Department. ... The fact that we do not plan space programs for aggression does not mean that we have a national security space gap or that we will allow one to develop.
“Third, there is another misconception to the effect that the national space program is employing an unduly large portion of our engineering and scientific manpower. Added to this misconception is the parallel view that the space program is creating a shortage of such talents which otherwise would be applied in our civilian economy. Actually, profits in private enterprise are at an all-time high and, in general, higher in the non-space and non-defense companies than in those whose business is primarily government-financed for space and defense. If those very profitable companies do not hire scientists and engineers to engage in research and development, it is not because they can’t get them as their profit position gives them remarkable bargaining power. Rather, failure to employ such scarce talents in large numbers is the result of deliberate decisions on the part of private entrepreneurs and not because there are no such persons available. . . . Furthermore, government-financed research and development—particularly in such challenging fields as space—is having a salutary effect in stimulating an increase in the number of highly trained scientists and engineers.
“Fourth, there has also been some criticism and confusion on the subject of international cooperation in the space program. We have formed a useful base for peaceful and constructive relationships with some 60 other countries in space activities. The benefits are mutual. Some of our projects could just not have been conducted successfully without the tracking facilities, sites, and other cooperative efforts of countries around the world. In no case do we impair our national security through such cooperation, and we do not plan to do so. . . .
“Fifth, there are those who argue that it would be better to slow down—or even stop—our space effort in order to divert the resources to education, slum clearance, medical research, and other such purposes. As much as we need to do more in those important areas, it is unrealistic to believe that the resources are transferable—even if it were desirable to attempt the shift. . . . What is more, there is no assurance that the Congress would vote more funds for education or public housing just because it voted less for space. . . .” (Text)
January 8: Edward Z. Gray, Director of Advanced Studies in NASA Office of Manned Space Flight, said in Space Business Daily interview that when NASA builds a manned space station it would be “more sophisticated” than the dod Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), nasa now has 13 studies dealing with concepts leading toward development of an orbiting manned space station; when these studies are completed, NASA would be able to appraise “the space station requirements and what will be the best method of pursuing the development of a manned orbiting space station system.” (SBD, 1/8/64, 34)

•	usaf Office of Aerospace Research announced Dr. Sanford Freedman of
Tufts Univ. and Dr. Richard Held, Prof, of Experimental Psychology at MIT, had been conducting experiments of human performance in space and had expressed less optimism toward man’s adaptability in space than previously had been felt. The experimenters studied human performance under conditions of reduced and abnormal visual and audial inputs related to restriction of body movements. They found that the subject was able to adapt only when he was allowed free movement of his body or appropriate limb. Besides supporting the view that accuracy of performance was degraded under prolonged exposure to conditions not permitting a correlated motor-sensory feedback, the experimenters concluded that stimulus changes accompanying body movements were an important source of order in human adaptation. This order was dependent upon relative constancy of environmental factors, such as gravity. Where one or more of these factors was absent—such as in space—body coordinations depending upon their regularizing influence may in time be lost. (OAR Release 1-64-1)

•	The lowest altitude at which demarcation line between air space and outer
space should be assigned is 100 km. (60 mi.), according to Norman Sissenwine, usaf Cambridge Research Laboratories scientist and cochairman of U.S. Committee on the Extension of the Standard Atmosphere. Sissenwine’s definition had been requested by Hyman, Hayman, and Harris law firm, which was attempting legislative interpretation for the International Astronautical Federation and the International Institute of Space Law. Sissenwine acknowledged that ultimately the line must be drawn arbitrarily, explained considerations favoring 100 km.: “Aerodynamic forces on most of the ballistic re-entry, lifting re-entry, and boost-glide orbital aerospace vehicles can generally be neglected at altitudes above 100 km. (This may vary from 80 to 120 km, depending upon the vehicle concept, but I believe 100 km is a good nominal altitude to use.) . . .” He pointed out that atmosphere’s basic
composition begins to change near 100 km, “Specifically it has been determined that disassociation of molecular oxygen into atomic oxygen should be depicted at an altitude of 90 km in the Standard Atmosphere. . . .” Another consideration was that relationships of temperature and pressure fields to wind fields are generally constant to nearly 100 km. This is also true for speed of sound, coefficient of viscosity, kinematic viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Finally, he pointed out that meteors entering the atmosphere generally disintegrate below 120-km. altitude, and most meteor trails formed in atmospheric entry are observed below 100 km.

Johnson called for international sharing of knowledge: “The last four centuries of human experience have been centuries of exploration, discovery and advancement of the frontiers of man’s knowledge . . .
“America, as we know it—freedom, as we know it—could well not exist tomorrow for our children and their children if we should lose from our national life that confidence in the future and that enthusiasm for exploration which has brought us to this high moment of history and hope.
“All the seas have been sailed—all the continents explored.
“The highest mountains have been scaled—the darkest jungles penetrated.
“We have reached into the realms of space—and outward toward the domain of the stars.
“This generation of Americans is challenged to live a life of high adventure. If we are to keep our trust of freedom, we must—in these last four decades of this century—undertake explorations in many realms which dwarf all those of the last four centuries. . . .
“Scientific exploration and research know no national boundaries. Human knowledge is never the captive of international blocs.
“Common sense dictates that all nations lend their learning to all other nations. This is a loan in which the science of all nations is the benefi-
ciary and the good of all mankind is advanced. The more we share with each other, the less we misunderstand each other . . .
“This Nation is committed now to the most intensive effort ever made by any peoples to advance the frontier of human knowledge.
“We shall remain committed ...	;
“The United States shall welcome any who wish to join with us in seeking to serve the common good of mankind. But if others are not willing—or if they are not able—to join with us our own endeavors will not slacken . . .” (Text, Wash. Post, 1/19/64, A6)

• President Johnson sent $97.9 billion FY 1965 budget to Congress. Of space research and technology, he said:
“Our plan to place a man on the moon in this decade remains unchanged. It is an ambitious and important goal. In addition to providing great scientific benefits, it will demonstrate that our capability in space is second to no other nation’s. However, it is clear that no matter how brilliant our scientists and engineers, how farsighted our planners and managers or how frugal our administrators and contracting personnel, we cannot reach this goal without sufficient funds. There is no second-class ticket to space.
“Appropriations enacted for 1964 for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration were $6008 million below the amount requested. As a result, major development programs leading to the manned lunar landing have fallen behind schedule. Careful replanning of the entire program, including a reduction in the number of test flights, will offset some of this delay. Even so, more funds are needed in 1964, and I am therefore recommending a supplemental appropriation of $141 million for this year.
“For 1965,1 am requesting appropriations of $5.3 billion, $63 million above the 1964 amount, including the proposed supplemental appropriation. The 1964 and 1965 recommendations represent the minimum amount needed to achieve our goals in space. The estimated increase of $590 million in expenditures in 1965 is due principally to payments required by commitments made in 1964 and earlier years. With the leveling off of appropriations, annual outlays should remain relatively stable in subsequent years.
“In addition to the manned space flight program, though related to it, funds are included to support unmanned space flights for lunar exploration and supporting research and development. Funds are also included for scientific satellites, planetary probes, and experiments with meteorological and communications satellites.
“The programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are designed to maintain American supremacy in space and to demonstrate this supremacy by achieving a manned landing on the moon in this decade. . . .
“The level of activity in support of the 3-man Apollo lunar spacecraft development program will reach its peak during 1965 with 13 flight spacecraft in production by the end of the year. The Saturn V rocket program will be proceeding rapidly along its development cycle in preparation for launching the Apollo spacecraft, and will account for about $850 million of the estimated 1965 expenditures. . . .” (Text, NYT, 1/22/64119-21)

•	17-nation Disarmament Conference resumed in Geneva. In his letter of
Jan. 19 to the Conference, President Lyndon B. Johnson said: “There is only one item on the agenda of this conference—it is the leading item on the agenda of mankind—and that one item is peace.
“Already this conference has led to more concrete and effective results than any disarmament conference in modern history. Your efforts and deliberation laid the ground work for the nuclear test ban treaty—for the communications link between Washington and Moscow—and for the U.N. General Assembly action against nuclear weapons in space. . . .”
President Johnson then proposed five major types of potential agreement : to stop spread of nuclear weapons to nations not now possessing them; to accept observation posts on both sides; to stop all production of fissionable material; to ban threat or use of force in changing boundaries or controlling territories; and to freeze numbers and kinds of strategic nuclear-carrying vehicles (aircraft and missiles).

January 23: Rep. Thomas M. Pelly (R.-Wash.) introduced a concurrent resolution to change the goal of the manned lunar landing to before 1975 instead of before 1970 (H. Con. Res. 257). “The change of policy ... is to allow our scientists greater flexibility in meeting the challenging technological problems of the Apollo project. Especially, I have in mind the desirability of eliminating the pressures of meeting time schedules, of minimizing perils such as solar radiation, and frankly I would stretch out the fantastic cost of the manned space exploration program over a longer period of time. . . .
“My new resolution is to invite the opinions of qualified experts and knowledgeable persons on this subject. . . . Congress should provide for an overall reappraisal of such a costly manned flight activity which accounts for two-thirds of the $5 billion space budget. Certainly, I cannot believe there is any valid reason why the Space Administration and those engaged in the manned space research venture should not be given more latitude in the scheduling of the program. Any slippage in time schedules due to reasons of safety and increasing assurance of success should not require any apology or excuse. Nor should the program be speeded for prestige at the cost of added risk. Congress by adopting my resolution would be setting a policy of proceeding at an orderly and normal speed and of avoiding undue risks in establishing any deadline. Finally this greater latitude should allow for tighter budgeting and contribute to reductions in the level of annual appropriations.” (CR, 1/23/64, 932)

•	Paper on Government’s relationship with universities, by Delphis C. Gold-
berg, staff member of Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations of House Committee on Government Operations, inserted in Congressional Record:
“There is much to be said for disbursing a substantial portion of research project funds through universities as a partial substitute for the selection of individual grantees at the Federal level. However, I would doubt the political feasibility and wisdom of allocating very large sums to institutions to be expended at their discretion. Instead, I would propose that Federal agencies set standards for university project review committees and require approval of the grant management policies and procedures of an institution as a condition to its eligibility for distributing Federal research funds. . . .
“As the funds available for science and for each of its major components become more scarce relative to demand, Federal agencies will be increasingly confronted with the necessity of making hard choices in the allocation of money between research fields as well as between competing projects within each specialized field. The multi-disciplinary committee, consequently, will likely become a valuable device in helping to determine priorities for Federal science expenditures as the pressure for efficient resource allocation grows. The University project review committee, which included representation from a variety of disciplines and specialties, might serve in this capacity at the local level. . . .” (Text, CR, 1/23/64, A286-87)

“With llie Dyna-Soar experience in mind, it could be a big minus from llie standpoint of developmental continuity in later years. Dyna-Soar was killed for a number of reasons, but one of them was llie fact that it was not a very advanced spacecraft for its day (1965-66 flights). Suppose that, along about 1966 when mol is in ‘tin-bending’ status but still a year or two away from flight status, someone takes a long look at it and says ‘What have we got?’
“By that time, NASA will have accumulated close to 1,000 hours of manned space flight experience and will have tested a number of new and advanced systems; it will have conducted the all-important rendezvous tests willi llie Gemini spacecraft; llie earth-orbiting version of Apollo, which can stay aloft for two weeks as a space laboratory, will be in or near flight status.

January 29: NASA launched Saturn I SA-5 from AMR in first successful flight test of both stages of the rocket. The 1.5-million-lb.-thrust S—I stage performed as planned, and the 90,000-lb.-thrust upper stage (S-IV) powered by six liquid-hydrogen RL-10 engines separated and burned properly for eight minutes, attaining orbital speed. The orbited body (spent S-IV stage, instrument unit, payload adapter, Jupiter nose cone, and 11,500 lbs. of sand ballast) weighed 37,700 lbs., nearly 20,000 lbs. of which was payload. As the first of the Block II Saturn I’s, SA-5 was first flight test of both Saturn stages and only the second flight test of a liquid-hydrogen powered rocket stage (see Centaur AC-2, Nov. 27, 1963). The five Block II Saturn I’s differ from Block I predecessors in that they have live upper stages, S—I propellant tanks are extended to provide 100,000 lbs. usable propellant, and tail fins are added for stability. During the flight eight onboard motion picture cameras photographed various operations of the rocket and a TV camera provided real-time photographs of separation and ignition of S-IV stage. Shortly after S-I burnout, the motion picture cameras were ejected, impacting downrange where pararescue men recovered seven of them. This test of the world’s largest known rocket proved flight capability of Saturn I’s liquid-hydrogen, clustered-engine upper stage and demonstrated the vehicle’s capability to orbit 20,000-lb. payload.

January 29: Maj, Gen. Don R. Ostrander, Commander of usaf Office of Aerospace Research, addressed National Space Club in Washington:
“I am sometimes asked how mllitary space research differs from space research conducted by civilian institutions or other government agencies. The answer, of course, is that there is no difference, except in the ultimate purpose for which it is conducted. As a matter of fact, there is very close liaison in this field between my Command, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Office of Naval Research, and the scientific community. We make every effort to keep them informed about the work we are doing or sponsoring, and we are constantly exchanging information with them about our findings on the characteristics of space. Our job, however, is specifically to support llie Air Force mission in space. . . .
“I know that you are all familiar with the potential radiation hazards to man in space, particularly with the deadly proton showers that accompany certain solar flares. We have made great strides in predicting the onset of these showers at our Sacramento Peak Observatory in New Mexico.
“We can predict safe periods with increasing accuracy—better than most weather predictions here on earth—but lliere is still a large gray area in which we do not know whether conditions will be safe or unsafe. It is possible that we could narrow this gray area significantly with that which penetrates the atmosphere and can be picked up at llie observatory.
“If we had this knowledge, it would extend llie time we could operate in space willi absolute assurance of safety. It would also give us advanced early warning lliat would enable us if necessary to get our astronauts out of danger.
“Even in the present state of the art, our Sacramento Peak predictions have been crucial to the safety of the astronauts participating in the Mercury program. We have been able to give nasa absolute assurance of safe conditions, insofar as proton showers are concerned, when the astronauts have gone into orbit; and warnings of potential danger, at other times. . . .” (Text)

January 30: nasa launched ranger vi lunar probe with Atlas-Agena B launch vehicle from AMR in lunar landing mission to photograph the moon’s surface. The Atlas booster fired properly and, after stage separation, the Agena B stage ignited and attained orbital speed. After coasting in parking orbit of about 110-mi. altitude, the Agena B reignited, sending RANGER VI through the “launch window” on a course which would pass within 600 mi. of the moon. A midcourse correction maneuver was planned so that the spacecraft would impact the lunar surface. The only scientific instruments onboard the 804-lb. spacecraft were six TV cameras, designed to provide more llian 3,000 photographs of the lunar surface during the last 10 min. of the 66-hr. flight. This was the first Ranger launch since October 1962, when extensive review of the Ranger project was undertaken because of previous Ranger failures.

January 30: nasa Administrator James E. Webb addressed World Affairs Council of Northern California, in San Francisco, discussed national and international aspects of llie U.S. space program:
“The competition is tough. The U.S.S.R. has the ability to concentrate its efforts without public debate and without the regard for individual freedom of choice or living standards which enjoy high priority in our own country. But it does not follow that our own space effort should be similarly concentrated. The implications of space are broad, broader than we can now know, and lliey do not end on the moon. The necessary technologies are enormously demanding and therefore enormously promising. And, whatever we do in space, we are critically dependent upon a thorough knowledge of the space environment. Moreover, llie Soviet program, which has appeared to many of us to be so narrow and directed almost exclusively to prestigious exploits, more recently gives signs of broadening to include considerable basic research as well as practical investigations, for example, through the use of weather satellites in which we pioneered.
“Therefore, we must not be trapped into a narrow competition— focusing our energies on one mission or even on manned flight alone. Our preparations must be broad enough to give us a flexible base suitable for a continuity of effort and ability to move in a direction or directions perhaps still unknown.
“The projects and programs, national and international, in which we are engaged have unprecedented scope and potential. It is this scope and lliis potential which make space activity a valuable instrument of national and international policy. It is a many faceted tool to be used for the economic and social advance of this and cooperating nations as well as for llie preservation of our technological and political leadership in llie world. This tool and its importance should be fully understood and appreciated. At the same time, as Lord Hailsham has said, we should remember lliat international cooperation is not a substitute for national excellence.
“Europe has not been alone in recognizing these factors. In llie complex of UN organizations, great interest has been evidenced among nations great and small in llie problems and benefits of space.
“Here again, space has served to bring East, West, and neutrals together in a code of legal principles to govern space activity, which was unanimously adopted in the last session of the General Assembly. In the associated forum of the International Telecommunications Union agreements were reached on the assignment of radio frequencies for space research and space communications. Without these arrangements the future of communications satellite systems would be heavily clouded. And in another UN agency, the World Meteorological Organization, a start has been made in the evaluation and planning of requirements for a world weather satellite system which also promises real economic and human benefits.
“Thus it is clear that our national effort in space research and exploration is becoming a powerful force in developing greater international cooperation—cooperation which is not limited to the nations of the Free World, but which spans the Iron Curtain, as well. It is in this context, as a force which joins all mankind against a common enemy, the hostile environment of space, rather than against each other, that the space effort may bring the most significant and enduring rewards.” (Text)

February 2: ranger vi crashed onto the moon on target in the Sea of Tranquility, but its onboard camera system failed to return TV photographs of the lunar surface. Indications were that the two TV systems responded to Central Computer and Sequencer (cc&s) command to warm up, but the cameras did not complete the warm-up to picture taking. RANGER Vi’s cameras (two wide-angle and four narrow-angle) were to have made more than 3,000 photographs during its last 10 min. The photographs were to have provided scientific data on lunar topography and supported the Surveyor unmanned soft-landing spacecraft and Apollo manned lunar landing program.
Dr. William Pickering, Director of JPL which is responsible for Ranger project management as well as its tracking and communications through Deep Space Network, said of ranger vi:
“It was a sad finish to something that was going so good.
“Our accuracy was a very significant achievement. The failure of the camera system isn’t going to discourage us. I’m quite confident in our ability, and we will succeed in exploring the moon on a future shot.” NASA planned three more Ranger TV flights this year. (Witkin, NYT, 2/3/64; upi, Wash.

“This achievement is underlined by the fact that it is now four and a half years since either the Russians or the Americans have made a direct hit of this nature on the lunar surface, despite repeated attempts.”
Kenneth W. Gatland, Director of the British Interplanetary Society, referred to the failure of ranger Vi’s cameras to take pictures: “I should say this is one of the most bitter disappointments of the space age so far in having come so near to success in a vital reconnaissance.” He speculated that the cameras may have failed to work because the temperature caused a relay to stick or a component to fail.

February 2: Tass announced electron i and electron II scientific satellites were continuing their elliptical orbits of the earth. By 6:00 p.m. Moscow time Feb. 1, electron i had passed repeatedly through the inner radation belt in its 19 orbits and electron ii had moved four times through the outer radiation belt in its two orbits. Tass said the following studies were being made with aid of onboard equipment: outer and inner radiation belts; charged particles having low energy; concentrations of electrons and positive ions; magnetic fields and radiation belts of the earth; nuclear component of cosmic radiation; shortwave solar radiation; propagation of radio waves; radio-radiation of galaxies; and densities of meteoritic material. Tass said the studies, being accomplished under a unified program in various areas of outer space, were being conducted for the first time. These studies were important for conducting the program of the IQSY and for permitting collection of data to assure radiation safety of manned space flights. Tass said all onboard equipment was functioning normally and ground stations were receiving scientific data from the satellites. (Tass, Krasnaya Zvezda, 2/2/64,1, atss-t Trans.)

February 3: Secretary of the Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert testified before House Committee on Armed Services:
“In the field of military applications of space, our views as to the future remain unchanged. We believe that we must vigorously exploit the most likely avenues of interest, though we are not yet able to be definitive enough to describe man’s military space role adequately to project specific weapon systems. . . .
“The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program, which replaced the Dyna-Soar, is a research program aimed at giving man the opportunity to operate in space so lliat we may determine whellier and when llie manned space vehicle will be militarily significant. The mol program will provide much of llie supporting knowledge for indicated future manned space systems. The timing of the program is based upon a technical decision that our primary need is to know what functions man can perform in orbit, before exploring, as completely as Dyna-Soar would have, the problems and techniques of controlled reentry. This latter will now he studied on a more limited developmental basis.” (Text, AF Info. Pol. Ltr., 2/64)

February 4: U.S. Committee for International Quiet Sun Year (iqsy) and usn announced satellite to monitor solar x-ray emission, instrumented by Naval Research Laboratory scientists, was launched recently to initiate continuous “watch on the sun” during iqsy (1964-65). First signals from the satellite showed the sun now is close to its minimum activity, reported nrl scientists Robert W. Kreplin, Talbot A. Chubb, and Herbert Friedman. Any solar activity that occurs this year should be isolated and relatively uncomplicated, permitting the satellite to record individual storm centers, in contrast to igy which was marked by succession of overlapping storms. Observatories in 14 countries joined
U.S. in preparing to utilize continuous data transmissions from the satellite.
At press conference, the NRL scientists said that astronauts on lunar flight would be under no more radiation danger during maximum period of solar cycle than during minimum period.

•	House Committee on Science and Astronautics began hearings on NASA
authorization for FY 1965. NASA Administrator James E. Webb testified:
“In the tight budget situation faced by the President for Fiscal Year 1965 it was necessary to stress with him and the Bureau of the Budget that unless the full $5.3 billion authorization requested for FY 1965, and •the supplemental appropriation of $141 million requested for FY 1964 are approved, the manned space flight program will encounter further delays. It will then not be possible to achieve the national goal of exploring the moon with men within this decade.
“There may be some inclination to assume that the adjustment of our program to the reductions imposed for FY 1964 indicates that this will likewise be possible in the event of reductions in the request which is before you at this time. I cannot emphasize too strongly that this is not the case.
“In adjusting our program to compensate for the reductions made in the appropriation for FY 1964, we have already sacrificed the margins and early target dates which were needed, and which in reality are still needed, in our effort to achieve the goals which have been set for us. In fact, Mr. Chairman, we are not able to maintain a reasonably balanced program, and accommodate the entire reduction, with any strong assurance that we can meet the 1970 lunar target date. The best we can say is that we have a ‘fighting chance.’
“To sum up our situation in a sentence, if we do not receive the funds which the President has requested, there is nothing left to sacrifice except the National goal itself.
“. . . whether it is agreed or not that international considerations and national security factors require that we hold to the present pace of the space program, llie fact is that prudence and economy will be served. Even if economy alone were to be the guiding consideration in llie evaluation of the NASA request for FY 1965, llie cost of establishing and maintaining superiority in space will be less if we maintain the pace, llie momentum, which llie supplemental, appropriation and lliis aulliorization request will provide.
“. . . Despite llie difficulties which have been experienced, we can still put two American explorers on llie moon in this decade, and we can do it for less llian $20 billion. . . . [But] if llie program is further curtailed, if the momentum is lost, if llie Apollo program is stretched into the next decade, the cost will not be under $20 billion, it will be several billions more. The ultimate cost will increase for each year in which achievement of our goal is delayed.
“. . . [According to a NASA study], llie cost of llie lunar exploration would increase by approximately $1 billion for each year lliat the landing is delayed. A lliree year delay would cost $3 billion, a six year delay $6 billion, with no corresponding improvement in llie benefits obtained. . . .” (Testimony: CR. 2/5/64, A545-48)
February 4: NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L. Dryden testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics:
“Because of llie initiative and the daring of the Wright Brothers, this nation gave man llie capacity for powered flight, freeing him forever from llie bonds which for lliousands of years of human existence had confined his activities to land and sea. The United States became llie first country in llie world to possess a military airplane when, in 1908, the Army Signal Corps contracted for a Wright biplane.
“Yet, prior to World War I lliis nation was still so pre-occupied willi conventional weapons systems that it totally neglected llie development of aeronautics—llie force which was to dominate warfare for llie next quarter century. In 1914, the United States possessed fewer military aircraft and of inferior types llian llie six leading aeronautical nations (including Mexico). The United States in 1914 was llie only major nation in llie world not to possess an aeronautical laboratory with an up-to-date wind tunnel. By November 1918, not one aircraft of Ameri-
can design and manufacture had entered combat operations during World War I.
“In the 30’s we were so pre-occupied with refinement of conventional piston-driven aeronautical systems that we made little progress in jet propulsion. Meanwhile, the Germans set out to build a bigger and better NACA and to a large extent, they did, developing jet propelled military aircraft and 5%-ton V-2 rockets, which almost spelled disaster in World War II.
“In the late 40’s, despite the fact that Robert Goddard had demonstrated the feasibility of a liquid-fueled rocket engine in this country in 1926, and despite the memory of V—2’s raining on London during the blitz, we were so pre-occupied with mating jet carriers to our exclusively held atomic bomb capability that we neglected missilry while other nations forged ahead. And finally, in the 50’s, our A-bomb advantage gone, we were so pre-occupied with the development of our ballistic missile program that we neglected a clear opportunity to become first in space.
“Today, the nation faces, we all face, this question: Have we learned enough from the often bitter and always costly experience of the last hall century not only to carry out with determination this effort to meet the requirements of the present in space research and exploration, but to exercise the vision which is demanded if we are not, once again, to find ourselves lagging in the next phase of this most challenging effort? . . .
“The present gap in manned flight activity is a direct consequence of a postponement of the decision to proceed beyond Project Mercury from September 1960, until May 1961, when President Kennedy recommended the present manned lunar landing project as a national goal.
“The decisions which confront us today are those which will determine whether this kind of history will repeat itself a few years hence and whether we will once again experience a bitter awakening to the fact that others have seized the initiative in the more advanced space missions of the future. . . .” (Testimony; CR, 2/5/64, A548-50) February 4: Nike-Cajun sounding rockets with grenade experiments were launched at Wallops Island, Va., and Ft.

•	In Washington Evening Star article, William Hines reported Georgetown
Univ. astronomer Dr. Carl C. Kiess’ conviction that life cannot exist on Mars. Dr. Kiess’ spectrographic observations of the planet convinced him no oxygen or water vapor existed there. Nitrogen compounds have been detected, and Dr. Kiess believed Martian atmosphere is 97-99% pure nitrogen gas. He believed density of air at Martian surface is greater than is generally believed, meaning that nitrogen tetroxide could exist as gas, liquid, and solid—gaseous above 70° F, solid below 14° F, and liquid in between. In laboratory experiments Dr. Kiess had demonstrated that when various nitrogen compounds are subjected to temperature changes they turn color to duplicate “seasonal” color changes observed on Mars, even creating artificial “snow storm” and simulating waxing and waning of Martian “polar caps.” Dr. Kiess’ view was minority opinion, refuted by majority of scientists.

•	nasa Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., testifying before
House Committee on Science and Astronautics, discussed NASA organization, management, procurement, and programing.
“The management and programing processes . . . require continuing program support, assuming reasonable accomplishment by NASA compared with our stated goals. Little that we start in one year is completed in that year. On the average, flight projects require three or more years prior to launch, while total programs have a life of ten to fifteen years. The governmental process for allocating resources can lead to a funding pattern at odds with this inherently long-duration need. We plan to accomplish major objectives over the period of a decade, but we must tailor our actual accomplishment to those resources that we receive annually.
“A budget of $5,445 billion, in our estimation, provides the necessary increment of resources to support the technical program .... This is divided into $141 million, requested as our FY 1964 supplemental, and a $5,304 billion budget for FY 1965. During the preparation of this budget, we were asked by the President to make major cost reductions, in part by introducing improved management practices. This was done prior to submission of the President’s budget, and llie estimated cost savings are therefore reflected in our budgetary request. . . . Within lliese estimates, we propose to carry out lliis year’s increment of NASA’s program of aeronautical research, advanced technological development, space hardware development, and space exploration.” (Testimony)

• Testifying before House Committee on Science and Astronautics, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell discussed objectives, progress, and future plans of NASA’s programs in the area of space science (space environment, sun-earth relationships, geodesy, investigation of moon and planets, investigation into nature of the universe, exobiology) and applications (meteorological satellites, communications program, and advanced technological satellites). Some of the space environment results obtained during the past year:
“1. The existence of an appreciable number of protons in the outer Van Allen Belts was established.
“2. The lifetime in the belt of artificially injected electrons was determined. . . .
“3. Trapping lifetimes and rates of enhancement of electrons of varying energies in the outer radiation zone have been correlated with magnetic storms.
“4. Large low energy electron fluxes have been found on lines of magnetic force which appear to trail off to immense distances out into deep space.
“5. Contours of constant counting rate near the magnetic equator were found to draw closer to the Earth on the night side of the Earth than on the day side.
“6. Repeated observations were made of simultaneous vlf electromagnetic emission, auroral optical emission, and particle precipitation into the atmosphere.
“7. It was discovered that the Earth’s magnetic tail in the antisolar direction extends at least half way to the Moon’s orbit.
“8. Direct observations were made of the way in which solar plasma on the sunward side of the Earth piles up outside the boundary of the Earth’s magnetic field, and in so doing appreciably compresses the geomagnetic field.
“9. Direct extended observations were made of the particle density and velocity of solar interplanetary plasma. These densities and velocities were found to have direct correlations with magnetic activity on the Earth and calcium plage activity regions on the Sun.
“10. Extended measurements were made of the interplanetary magnetic field and solar and galactic cosmic ray intensities.
“11. The true energy spectrum possessed by solar cosmic rays at their source on the Sun was deduced from the observational data. . . .
“12. First simultaneous measurements were made of electron temperature, positive ion density, and neutral atmospheric constituents in the Earth’s high atmosphere.
“13. A new theory was developed to account for the types of ions found in the ionosphere, specifically the ratio of helium to hydrogen.
“14. Sounding rockets furnished important information on the ionospheric D region from 35 miles to 55 miles and the origin of the sporadic effects in the E region of the ionosphere at about 75 miles.
“15. Diurnal and seasonal variations in the ionosphere were established.
“16. Sounding rockets launched simultaneously with an overhead pass of the satellite Alouette reached within a few miles of the satellite, thereby connecting up ionospheric measurements in the lower atmosphere with those being made by the satellite.” (Testimony)

•	Dr. Albert C. Hall, DOD Deputy Director for Space, Directorate of Defense
Research & Engineering, discussed the objectives of the military space program at Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers’ Winter Convention on Military Electronics, Los Angeles:
“Our problems . . . are twofold: First: the United States military space program must be one of action, not reaction. We must concern ourselves with military space developments—not necessarily to match or offset any Soviet development, but to sustain and augment our own versatility and strength. The successes we have already obtained should encourage us in this drive. Second, mindful that in the past we often have been optimistic in the short run and pessimistic in the long run, we must expect that some of the new discoveries and developments that appear may suggest applications and capabilities in wholly unplanned ways. Accordingly, while we pursue efforts where applications are clear we must also lay a foundation of technology, knowledge,
and experience which is sufficiently broad in scope to provide for future contingencies as lliey materialize or are identified.
“From lliese considerations, llien, are derived llie two fundamental goals of llie Defense space program:
“First, to continue with llie development and exploitation of space systems and capabilities which measure up on a cost-effectiveness basis to meet clearly defined high priority national defense requirements.
“Second, to develop llirough a program integrated with ollier government agencies, such as NASA and llie aec, a broad base of technology and experience to permit llie timely development and exploitation of space systems and capabilities which may be needed in llie future, recognizing that lead times in certain areas, such as manned military space operations, may be 10 years or longer. . . .” (Text, DOD Release 106-64)

February 6: In testimony before House Committee on Science and Astronautics, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller said that “1963 was a milestone year. It was the year of transition to hardware—now we can fill llie pipeline and move forward to a manned lunar landing in this decade. . . .
“The resources for llie Gemini and Apollo programs are moving forward. The major developmental resources are essentially completed; the manufacturing resources are under construction and approaching our goal; llie test and operational resources have been initiated; a logistics program is being formulated and our personnel build-up is progressing.
“The personnel staffing at the NASA Centers ... is increasing from 11,858 at the end of FY 1963 to 13,711 at the end of FY 1964 and a forecast total of 14,711 at the end of FY 1965. In addition to the government team of personnel there are approximately 181,000 contractor personnel who are working on Manned Space Flight programs. Willi llie continued buildup of construction, manufacturing, test and operations, it is anticipated lliat lliis figure will approximate
300,000	personnel at llie peak of llie Manned Space Flight Program. ...”
Discussing planned activity in manned space flight program, he said: “A major decision was made in 1963 to adopt llie ‘all-up’ testing concept as a basic approach to our flight verification test program. ‘All-up’ testing means, all flights will be scheduled willi complete space vehicles using live stages and flight type spacecraft. ...
“There are several advantages to llie ‘all-up’ approach. It will permit us to land an American astronaut on llie moon, and return him safely to earlli, in accordance willi our schedule even lliough we are operating this year on a reduced budget. It will permit us to capitalize on successful flights. It will also allow us to gallier a very large amount of data early in the flight program and lliereby provide much needed information to our design organization. It is planned in llie Saturn IB and Saturn V programs to launch a complete unmanned space vehicle on the first flight in an earth orbital trajectory.” (Testimony) February 6: NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, appearing before House Committee on Science and Astronautics, outlined nasa’s program of advanced research and technology and proposed activities for FY 1965. Objectives in advanced research and technology were summarized:
“1. Basic research aimed toward an understanding of llie natural laws underlying aeronautical and space technology.
“2. Engineering research aimed at the application of lliese laws and at codifying them in terms of engineering design principles.
“3. Experimental subsystem development, using advanced concepts and components, to produce test ‘know-how’ for llie design of future operational systems.
“Our aim in basic research is to contribute to llie fund of relevant scientific knowledge and, in so doing, to maintain llie best possible contact willi the scientific and engineering community. Engineering research, that is llie creation of engineering design principles, is also conducted by lliese same institutions with industry playing a somewhat greater role llian in the case of basic research ....

February 6: Washington Post editorialized:
“The failure of the sixth straight Ranger spacecraft hoists aloft the question of whether the United States will accomplish its goal of putting an American on the moon by the decade’s end. . . .
“A delay would not simply be a case of a stretchout in which work would continue but at a slower pace. A delay would take much of the binding and motivating tension from Apollo. It would increase costs by underusing men and facilities brought together for a tighter schedule, and it would allow projects and personnel to drift out of the main stream into the eddies of lower priority. A delay also would entail loss of prestige for NASA, for the Administration and for the Nation as well.
“No schedule, however, is sacred. If it is determined that the landing of a man on the moon by Jan. 1, 1970, is simply not feasible, or cannot be done with reasonable assurance of safety for the astronauts, then the space agency and the country will have to adjust to this reality, no matter how costly and comfortless it may be. A manned flight to the moon will be no less exciting or valuable for being somewhat delayed.” {Wash. Post, 2/6/64,18)

February 11: NASA Administrator James E. Webb announced at Hq. press conference that U.S.—U.S.S.R. communications experiments with echo II balloon satellite would begin after Feb. 21.
In response to question, Mr. Webb said failure of attempts to acquire lunar photographs had not adversely affected Apollo schedule: “. . . up to this time we have not had to make any changes in the program due to this, nor do I think we will.”
Asked whether 1969 date for manned lunar landing was a “deadline” or a “planning date”, Mr. Webb said:
“The view President Kennedy had . .. was that he was setting a deadline by which he wanted this nation to get the job done, and he was providing resources for us to plan the flight in 1967, or early 1968, giving some leeway for intractable technical problems, for unknown and unforeseeable things, and also to avoid having to put into parallel development systems that would be more expensive if done that way. . . .
“Now, the 1967, early 1968 target date that we were setting was to mobilize the effort, to press forward with it, but not to do so in such a way as to run this cost up from $20 billion to something much higher.
“So we were thinking of it as pretty much of a deadline that it was in the interests of this nation to meet.
“Now, with the cuts last year of $600 million and the reorganization of the effort to all-up systems testing, the cancellation of a number of Saturn flights, things of this kind, I think you’ve got to think of it somewhat differently. I think the target date for the flights, which is a tight date but still attainable, is mighty close to the January 1, 1970 period.
“. . . I believe we can do it within the latter six months of 1969 if we proceed vigorously under the plan we have presented to the Congress. But again we don’t have any leeway. . . . We have lost that, and we’ve got no more than what I’d call a fighting chance to do this by January 1,1970.”
Mr. Webb discussed NASA relationship willi Cal Tech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, manager of NASA’s lunar and planetary exploration programs. The current three-year contract “expires next June and we have now for some months been examining together willi llie California Institute of Technology ways and means to make a better relationship from llieir standpoint and from NASA’s standpoint.” Mr. Webb said NASA was seeking a reorganization of JPL to achieve a “hardheaded type of industrial management.” (Finney,- NYT, 2/12/64; Loory, N.Y.

“Landings on llie moon will add to our knowledge of the origin of the universe, and also contribute to our knowledge of llie broad spectrum of science and technology in such areas as meteorology and communications . . .
“But llie lunar project is not the whole space program; and the military significance of llie program cannot be judged by examining lliat project alone; nor can anyone today estimate the great weallli and resources lliat will flow from this new knowledge.

•	NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E.
Mueller said in hearings before Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight, House Committee on Science and Astronautics, that for Project Gemini “the year 1963 was, quite frankly, one of development headaches. It was the year of development and qualification testing of Gemini’s many equipments. The program is now largely over the development hump, however, and all Gemini spacecraft and launch vehicle subsystems will be fully qualified in 1964. Significant in 1963 also were a number of hardware deliveries. ...
“In 1964, three vitally important flights will be made—the third one manned and orbital. The year will be characterized by production, test, and delivery of spacecraft and launch vehicles. . . .”
Questioned about return to earth and landing in Project Gemini, Dr. Mueller and George Low said that plans now called for the two-man Gemini spacecraft to land on water rather than dry land. NASA had been investigating both procedures, and paraglider for land recoveries
was still in development stage. Paraglider would be “available” at about the time of the last two Gemini flights but “not necessarily scheduled.” Dr. Mueller added that water landing also would be “characteristic” for manned Apollo flights. (Testimony; Finney, NYT, 2/19/64, 19; M&R, 2/24/64,21)
February 18: NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell discussed Lunar Orbiter in testimony before Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications, House Committee on Science and Astronautics: “In 1963, die Lunar Orbiter was defined and a contractor selected. This program will move into high gear this year and will require $49.3 million in Fiscal Year 1965 to meet its targeted first launch in 1966. This will be a tight schedule but because of the importance of this mission in support of Apollo, every effort will be made to meet that date. . . .”
Questioned by Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D.-Minn.), Dr. Newell said NASA was thinking about adding five Lunar Orbiters to the five already approved. The proposed increase was because the Lunar Orbiter “will be a most important spacecraft not only for the support of the manned lunar landing effort, but for continuing research on the moon, on its geodetic properties, and experiments on radioactivity of the lunar surface.”
Of the recently orbited echo ii passive communications satellite, Dr. Newell said: “The echo n has shown some scintillation in tfye radio wavelengths which might indicate that it has some defect in shape—perhaps a tear, maybe a dent, or something of that sort. However, it shows no such scintillation on the optical observations, which is puzzling. It remains, however, a completely adequate reflector so that whatever distortion in shape may have occurred has not interfered with its usefulness.” (Transcript)

“We are requesting $274.4 million to support the Tracking and Data Acquisition program in fiscal year 1965, as compared to $307.7 million in fiscal year 1964, a decrease of eleven per cent. The reason for this decrease is that most of our .new station construction requirements in all three networks, were funded in fiscal years 1963 and 1964. . . .” Mr. Buckley pointed out that the largest single item in ot&da budget for FY 1965 was $106.9 million for equipping the manned space flight network for Projects Gemini and Apollo.

•	Discovery of the omega-minus particle in the atomic structure was hailed
as a significant step toward construction of an ordered table of elements for the atom similar in nature and importance to the periodic table of elements. Prof. Paul T. Matthews, of the Imperial College, London, and a Fellow of the Royal Society, described his discovery in the British journal New Scientist. Prof. Y. Ohnuki had suggested in 1960 that the clue to orderly relationship between the 50 or more known atomic particles might lie in a type of “spin” which could only be described in
mathematical terms and known as “unitary transformations.” Several scientists in various parts of the world, including Dr. Murray Gell-Mann in the U.S., began working on this theory. Relationships did begin to appear among particles; also it became apparent that one more subparticle was needed. Its characteristics could be deduced from its place in the atomic relationship. At this point teams of scientists went to work with the 33-billion-volt Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brook-haven National Laboratory and others with equipment at the Center for European Nuclear Research (cern) at Geneva, Switzerland. Analysis of 100,000 photographs of bubble patterns made by accelerated atomic particles traveling through “boiling” liquid hydrogen disclosed two sightings of particles with the characteristics predicted by the relationship table.

• Edward Z. Gray, nasa Director of Advanced Manned Missions, described manned lunar bases under study for post-Apollo missions, in testimony before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight. “The earliest system we can see for extending the capability of Apollo would be the Apollo logistic support system (alss) .
“It consists of the launching on the Saturn V of an Apollo spacecraft with an unmanned lem, wherein we have replaced the ascent stage of the lem with a cargo compartment. The Apollo spacecraft and unmanned lem, or lem truck are launched to the Moon. The lem truck is disengaged from the Apollo spacecraft in lunar orbit and lands in an unmanned mode on the surface of the Moon.
“The payload capability with the present Apollo launch vehicles and spacecraft would be approximately 7,000 pounds. There would be a payload volume of about 2,000 cubic feet. This would provide a shelter with occupancy capability for two men for about 14 days on the lunar surface. An alternate payload that could be carried by the lem truck would be a two-man roving vehicle . . ., which would have a capability to cover about 200 to 300 miles on the lunar surface in the 14 days. . ..
“Then looking beyond to the time when much greater staytime on the lunar surface would be desired, we show a lunar exploration system for Apollo (lesa) which weighs about 25,000 pounds on the surface of the Moon. These are Earth pounds.
“It would be launched with a Saturn V without an Apollo spacecraft and would be delivered in an unmanned mode directly onto the surface of the Moon. It has a volume of over 3,000 cubic feet, and could provide satisfactory shelter and life support for 3 men to stay 90 days on the surface of the Moon.
“The mode of operation would be to launch this unmanned vehicle to the surface of the Moon, and follow it up with an Apollo launch so that the lem would land in the near vicinity of the lesa payload, probably using a homing radar. ...”
He described the LESA concept as expandable through addition of modules; for instance, three modules could form a base for 18 men, 24 months occupancy time. {1965 NASA Auth. Hearings, Part 2, 59799)

“In recent months, we have reviewed thoroughly the status of program technology . . ., the pace of the program for its impact on total cost . . ., and the possible effects on the program of the hazards of interplanetary space. . . .
“First, with respect to technology ... we have found all of the knotty questions involved in advancing the state of the art are yielding to hard work. We know of no technological problems that would prevent our accomplishing the Apollo program in this decade. . . .
“[Second], . . . starting with the level of funding planned for the current fiscal year there is sound economic justification for maintaining the program on its present schedule. To stretch out the program at this time would add to the cost and unnecessarily delay lliis first major step in space exploration.
“The final area of examination of the program has been willi respect to llie hazards of interplanetary space. . . . Estimates based on present information indicate lliat meteoroids will not constitute a major problem in llie planning of llie first manned lunar exploration. . . .

• Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of Britain’s Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, advocated international controls on space experiments. In Saturday Evening Post article, he said: “It is now time for concern about the ethical standards which man must apply to embryonic dangers which are not obvious. We cannot afford to wait until the dangers become practically apparent, since some experiments may create an irretrievable condition. . . .”
As an example, he described the ozone layer, and continued: “. . . it happens that zone is rather easy to destroy. And if it is intentionally or accidentally removed, then the ultraviolet radiation would penetrate to earth. If this happened for a sufficiently long period, then human beings migh suffer severe sunburn and possible sterilization. Further, the temperature distribution in llie atmosphere could be radically altered and, in the state of our present knowledge, no one could predict what climatic changes might occur.
“It is not difficult to estimate lliat a few tons of suitable contaminant, deposited in llie atmosphere 25 miles above llie earth, would destroy the ozone over several miles for a few hours.... a rocket launched from earlli to land a man on llie moon might bum up 2,000 tons of fuel in its passage through llie earth’s atmosphere . . . [and] the launching of one such rocket a week might well lead to a permanent transformation of the conditions in llie high atmosphere,” according to recent study by llie Advanced Research Projects Agency.
“. . . when one turns from the contamination as an accidental byproduct to an intentional act, an ugly array of possibilities is revealed. To begin willi, specially selected substances could be deposited in great quantities at precise altitudes. . . . The American [arpa] report states that 25 tons of fluorine would be sufficient to depopulate the ionosphere of electrons and so blot out all long-distance radiotelephony. The deposition of large quantities of gases like carbon monoxide at an altitude of 25 miles might radically alter the temperature distribution and the climatic conditions by absorbing some of llie sun’s infrared radiation....
“The human race therefore faces a critical situation in llie next few decades, because there is at the moment little evidence of llie moral and legal controls which must be enforced if man’s continued life on earth is not to he jeopardized by the accidental or intentional results of space research. There are large areas of uncertainty, so lliat it is not yet possible to assess whether various ollier space activities may affect man more directly llian in llie inhibition of his study of llie cosmos. It is a vital necessity of our age that the political decisions on lliese problems should be based on the judgment of llie international scientific community, and that lliis judgment should govern the future space launchings of the world.” (Sat.

We consider it essential to develop an aerospace plane able to lift off from Earth, go up to orbit in the form of an airplane with wings, return like the Dyna-Soar along a glide path to Earth and land like an airplane so it can be re-used.” He said he had modified his chemical rocket-sled idea into steam-rocket sled and had developed such a rocket. “It'develops 30 tons of thrust. We ran hundreds of tests on it. We would use it to accelerate a stage to subsonic or perhaps supersonic velocity.”
Dr. Saenger described Egyptian rocket development, which he had assisted until late 1961 when West German government asked him to stop: “I was asked in the spring of 1960 by the Egyptian government to give lectures at Cairo University and help the country by doing consulting work on meteorological sounding rockets. . . .

“Last year this engine project [M-l], which was originally planned for completion in the late 60’s, was slowed down to a minimum level of effort consistent with such a development program. It is our intent to maintain the low level of funding during the present critical years of the manned lunar landing program and then to accelerate this development for completion in the early 70’s. . . .
“The M—1 can be a team-mate of the large solid propellant motors. Potentially these two, if used in vehicle systems together, can provide the United States with increased payload capability at reduced cost during the 1970’s. . . .

February 27: Harold B. Finger, Manager of aec-NASA Space Nuclear Propulsion Office and Director of NASA Nuclear Systems and Space Power, discussed nuclear rockets before Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Tracking, House Committee on Science and Astronautics: “. . . our major effort is in the reactor area. It includes analysis and experimental work on all of the components and subsystems of our reactors with sufficient evaluation and testing to give the greatest possible confidence in the successful operation of the graphite reactors that will form the basis for the first nuclear rocket engines to be developed in the world. We are, however, not overlooking the potential advantages provided by the metallic tungsten reactors. We are, therefore, conducting a program to evaluate the feasibility and advantages of these systems.
“Our nerva engine and non-nuclear component technology work has made substantial progress in those difficult areas of engine technology that require extension of presently available information so that system development can eventually be undertaken rapidly and with a high degree of confidence.
“Sufficient facilities are available or are being constructed for the conduct of our presently planned program. Tests to be conducted in our reactor facilities during this year should clearly demonstrate the success of the solutions we have designed to avoid the mechanical problems that have been encountered in the past and should demonstrate the operating capabilities of graphite reactors. Our advanced concept work is fundamental in nature; it is long term; but it is being pursued because of the high, theoretical performance potential of these advanced ideas for nuclear rocketry.
“Out of this over-all nuclear rocket program, I am convinced, will come a new family of rockets that will open the way to more extensive space travel than is possible with the chemical combustion rocket systems upon which we are now completely dependent. Although new in capability, the nuclear rockets we are now developing are logical follow-ons to the chemical rocket systems and, therefore, do not involve basically new test, development, and system technology or scientific breakthroughs. These nuclear rocket developments must be actively pursued to ensure that this country is not prevented from undertaking missions involving higher velocities, energies, and payloads than are required for the early Apollo manned lunar landing mission.” (Testimony)
• Harlan Cleveland, Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, addressed the Conference of U.S. National Organizations of the U.N.:
“The technological imperative—the impulse to build worldwide technical agencies—comes of course from the headlong pace of scientific discovery. A world technical community is in the making because international communications, international transport, and international economics demand international organizations—and because you can’t deal with world health or world weather or radio frequencies and a lot of other things except on a world basis. . . .
“Taken together, three new kinds of technology—weather satellites, communications satellites, and computer technology—now make it technically possible to work out a global weather reporting and forecasting system, a prospect too valuable to all nations to leave unexploited. The

•	At White House news conference, President Johnson announced:
“The United States has successfully developed an advance experimental jet aircraft, now the A-ll, which has been tested in sustained flight at more than 2,000 miles an hour and at altitudes in excess of
70,000	feet.
“The performance of the A-ll far exceeds that of any other aircraft in the world today. The development of this aircraft has been made possible by major advances in aircraft technology of great significance to both military and commercial application. Several A-l 1 aircraft are now being flight-tested at Edwards Air Force Base in California. . . .
“The development of supersonic commercial transport aircraft will also be greatly assisted by the lessons learned from this A-ll program. For example, one of the most important technological achievements in this project has been the mastery of the metallurgy and fabrication of titanium metal which is required for the high temperatures experienced by aircraft traveling at more than three times the speed of sound.
“Arrangements are being made to make this and other important technical developments available under appropriate safeguards to those directly engaged in the supersonic transport program.
“This program was first started in 1959. Appropriate members of the Senate and the House have been kept fully informed on the program since the day of its inception. The Lockheed Aircraft Corporation at
Burbank, Calif., is the manufacturer of the aircraft. The aircraft engine, the J—58, was designed and built by the Pratt & Whitney Division, United Aircraft Corporation. The experimental fire control and air-to-air missile system for the A—11 was developed by the Hughes Aircraft Company.
“In view of the continuing importance of these developments to our national security, the detailed performance of the A-ll will remain strictly classified and all individuals have been directed to refrain from making any further disclosure concerning this program. . . .”
The President also announced he would release on March 2 Eugene Black’s supersonic transport study. (Transcript, Wash. Post, 3/1/64, A20)
February 29: Distribution of space and military contracts was of growing concern for the Administration, John Finney reported in New York Times article. “Space contracts have tended to accentuate the existing research concentration on the East and West Coasts.” 90% of space contracts and 83% of defense research contracts were awarded to only 10 states, and in FY 1963 50% of space contracts and 41.4% of military r&d contracts were awarded in California. Finney pointed out that NASA, was “attempting to broaden the economic and industrial impact of its rapidly expanding program. . . . Working through universities, the agency is attempting to enlist new regions in its program and to apply the technological developments of its research to the civilian economy. ... In fact, James E. Webb, the agency head, has become a salesman ... to enlist new regions, new universities, new industries. . . .” (Finney, NYT, 3/1/64,1)
• In article on “The Politics of the Space Age” in the Saturday Evening Post, President Lyndon B. Johnson essayed his views on the manner in which space exploration may bring an end to hostilities among nations on earth. In this abridgement of forthcoming volume edited by Lillian Levy entitled Space: Its Impact on Man and Society, President Johnson said;
“. . . Any discussion of the ‘politics’ of the space age is, necessarily, a discussion of politics in the classical sense, not the convention-and-campaign sense. If the space age has not eliminated the smoke-filled room, it has at least opened a window and given air to fundamental and sometimes obscured values.
“The fate of the free society—and the human values it upholds— is inalterably tied to what happens in outer space, as humankind’s ultimate dimension. While the response of our technology is important, no less important is the response and the role of our political institutions—both to the challenge of the present and to the opportunities of the future.
“The vital role of politics in the space age has been evident since October 4, 1957, when the Soviet’s Sputnik I was launched. The orbiting of that first unmanned earth satellite was a feat of science. But the worldwide impact and importance were essentially political. Sputnik I was proclaimed by the Soviets as validation of Communist prophecies about the superiority of their political system. Such conclusions have been proved premature ...
“Why did this occur ? Self-examination is imperative. In retrospect, the answers seem to be these:
“1. Despite two decades of intensive scientific advance we had failed to establish adequate relationships between the scientific community and the political community—to the blame of each and the disservice of both.
“2. Inherent in the political miscalculation toward Space exploration was the influence of the unfortunate anti-intellectualism of the early 1950’s. . . . The open contempt with which the Sputnik I success was greeted by some in positions of political trust betrayed a degeneration of the respect for intellect which is indispensable to the governing of a free and open society.
“3. Perhaps the greatest failure of all was devaluation of the first— and the hardest—responsibility of elected representatives of the people in our system: the responsibility to lead. . . .
“In the years since 1957 the American political system and its politicians have acquitted themselves well, as have our scientists. An orderly program of space exploration has been devised and financed without unbalancing the values of our free society. . . .
“Our most important achievement politically in the space age has been this retention of basic national character, purpose and political values in our space program. It is reflected by a primary objective of our program, clearly stated at the outset, to gather knowledge for the benefit of all nations and to join with ail nations in this endeavor. . .
“Thus far the space age has been characterized as a period of competition. It is important, however, that we keep in mind the fact that the competitiveness is 'between political systems, not between national scientific communities. In the world of science the logical instinct is toward cooperation without regard to political boundaries. This impulse we must preserve. The real challenge of the space age is for the politician to tear down the walls between men which have been erected by his predecessors and contemporaries in the political field, rather than to raise its barriers higher into the free and peaceful vastness of space. If the potentials of the age of space are fully realized, this period will someday be known—and blessed by all people on earth—as the Golden Age of Political Science.” (Sat. Eve.

Their requests sat for months on someone’s desk.

•	Impact of global communications satellite systems was predicted by Arthur
C. Clarke in Astronautics and Aeronautics magazine. During the coming decade, comsat systems would bring about “orbital post office,” “orbital newspapers,” and “orbital telephony.” And eventually global comsat system would underscore requirement for universal language, which Clarke predicted would be met with English; would educate millions with TV visual aids; and would end barriers to free flow of information (such as censorship and jamming).
“The inexorable force of astronomical facts will destroy the political fantasies which so long fragmented our planet. For when all major artistic productions, entertainments, political and news events (not to mention disasters) can be observed and experienced simultaneously by the whole world, the parochialism and xenophobia of the past will not be able to survive.
“. . . another [influence], perhaps even more fundamental, may be reversal of an historic trend which has proceeded with scarcely a break for 5000 years. The traditional role of the city as a meeting-place is coming to an end; Megapolis may soon go the way of the dinosaurs it now resembles in so many respects. This century may see the beginnings of a slow but irresistible dispersion and decentralization of mankind—a physical dispersion which will take place, paradoxically enough, at the same time as cultural unification.” (Clarke, A/A, 2/64, 45—48)

For lliis reason, llie generation of new knowledge through research should, when possible, precede developments that are beyond the current state of the art. Only when llie pressures for immediate development are extremely great, as has been the case in these first years of our national space program, are we justified in violating the principle of order in favor of expediency. When we possess adequate research data, we not only are confident of the feasibility of any new missions for which we may wish to plan, but we also . . . lay the basis for improved reliability and efficiency and for reductions in llie weight and cost of the space vehicles required for these missions. The truth of these principles has been demonstrated many times in the past by costly developments which either had to be abandoned for lack of llie necessary technical capability to complete them or which could only be salvaged by crash research programs.
“We must, therefore, strive through research to develop new knowledge lliat will make new space missions possible, if and when national policy should dictate that any one of lliese missions must be accomplished. At the same time we must conduct the research required to ensure llie success of on-going projects, and we must also strive through research
to pave the way for increased reliability and efficiency of space vehicles of proven feasibility. . . .” (Testimony)
March 2: In interview with Aviation Week and Space Technology, Air Force Secretary Eugene M. Zuckert replied to question about mol:
“I am sure that llie mol must go forward. I am in sympalliy willi Mr. McNamara’s pressing us to try to define what we hope to do with it. This can have a lot to do willi llie subsystems lliat you plan to put in it. Also, llie definition effort has to do with llie cost, and willi llie time it is going to take us to do llie job. We haven’t suffered at any time in the last three years that I have been here by taking a few months to try and work out with reasonable precision what we are planning to do. I am convinced, for one, lliat the studies and program definition that we went through in the Titan 3 materially improved our chances of getting a fine booster at lower cost. I know, as Secretary McNamara knows, lliat there is a limit to the precision willi which you can define what you are going to do willi something you haven’t got. But the effort should be made to set out llie parameters. It has llie merit, at least, of excluding some of the things you know you are not going to try.

“The resources utilized in accomplishing the NASA Aeronautical Research program are found primarily in the highly-competent technical staffs of the four Research Centers of the NASA. The in-house effort is supported, as required, by a certain amount of out-of-house contract research performed by universities, non-profit organizations, and private industry. The funds requested for the NASA Aeronautics program support these in-house and out-of-house research efforts.

Methods for exchanging information on environmental aspects of supersonic transport were among the matters discussed, (faa Release 64-19) March 4: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, appearing before Senate Committee on Astronautical and Space Sciences, said:
“It is apparent to most persons who are concerned with the national space effort that we have reached what you described recently, Mr. Chairman, as a ‘critical mid-point’ in our effort to achieve space pre-eminence for the United States. We have moved from a circumstance in which the Soviet Union held clear superiority in space to one in which, as a result of the driving effort put forth in the past five years, we have achieved a degree of parity with the Russians in our ability to penetrate and operate in the space environment.
“As a consequence of this significant progress, the nation is in a position to consider not merely what it is able to do in space, but also what it is wise to do in view of our greatly increased scientific and technical ability. We have, in short, moved from a period in which we did everything we could in space, and regretted our inability to do more, to one in which we have a very large capability and are increasingly confronted with hard decisions in the selection of the programs which we will undertake.
“This is the position in which NASA found itself in preparing the program which is the basis for the FY 1965 authorization request. We have deferred or eliminated many projects which were worthy contenders for a place in the program and which, I believe, when budgetary limitations are less restrictive, the nation will decide to undertake. The activities which are proposed for FY 1965 will, in my judgment and that of my associates, produce the greatest benefits for the country within the limitations of the national resources which the President has decided are available and can prudently be spent for the NASA program. . . .” Mr. Webb cited mounting evidence that nasa’s need for scientists and engineers was not adversely affecting other areas:
“At the beginning of this calendar year, approximately 74,000 scientists and engineers were employed in the NASA program—about 12,000 within NASA, and 62,000 under NASA contracts and grants. This amounted to approximately 4.9 percent of the 1.5 million scientists and engineers in the nation’s work force.
“By next January, it is estimated that about 82,000 scientists and engineers will be working on the NASA program; about 5.2 percent of the available national supply. If the space effort were to continue at the present level of funding for the remainder of the decade, nasa’s program is not expected to require more than 5.5 percent of the national supply of scientists and engineers.
“Of particular interest, however, is the fact that NASA’s requirement for additional engineers has peaked at an earlier period than had been anticipated. Current statistics indicate that the number employed on NASA work increased by about 30,000 during the last calendar year, rather than 20,000 as had been anticipated. As a consequence, our requirement for the current year will Se only about 8,000 instead of
18,000	as had been projected. We will thus require a much smaller share than had been anticipated of the 45,000 engineers who will complete their education this year. . . .” (Testimony)

lower long-term costs while increasing flexibility and flight reliability. Development of this standardized vehicle is an excellent example of how existing space systems can be improved to satisfy new requirements. Improvement of a flight proven system such as Atlas is inherently more efficient and economical than designing new vehicles for new missions. Research and development costs are already expended and Atlas has certainly proven its reliability. . . .” (CR, 3/4/64, All 15)

“Six new international satellites, to be built and financed by three other nations, were programmed as contributions to the nasa scientific satellite effort over the next six years, bringing to ten the number of such cooperative satellite projects completed, in process, or agreed. . . .
Seven foreign experiments were selected in competition with domestic proposals for flight principally on NASA observatory satellites during the next three years. . . .
“Nineteen sounding rockets carrying scientific payloads were launched here or abroad in joint projects with nine countries, raising to forty-six the total of such launchings to date.
“New agreements were concluded with India and Pakistan under which both countries will j oin the UK and Australia in a year-long test of meteorological sounding rocket systems. ...”
After listing nasa activities in the categories of international ground-based experiments and relationships with European agencies (eldo and esro) , Dr. Dryden discussed implementation of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. bilateral agreement for space cooperation:
“. . . Correspondence has been maintained [with the Soviet Academy of Sciences], although the Soviet side has not met time schedules on most agreed action items. However, the Soviet Academy of Sciences has just conducted optical observations of the echo ii satellite during its early orbits and we were able to begin the telecommunications experiments with echo II between the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. on February 21. While we have not yet received detailed data of the optical observations and have still to evaluate the results of the telecommunications tests, which we have received, I think the real significance is that we are taking advantage of existing programs, approved and executed on their own merits, to provide an opportunity for scientists and engineers of both countries to gain experience in working together for their mutual benefit. This is obviously a pioneer venture and it has purposefully been designed as a coordinated rather than a joint effort. There is no provision for exchange of funds between the two countries, no exchange of equipment is involved and all exchanges of data are to be on a reciprocal basis and made available to all other interested countries. . . .” (Testimony)
March 5: In testimony before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, nasa Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., discussed NASA’s relationship with jpl :
“. . . [A] major contracting advance is taking place in our operating relationships with the California Institute of Technology . . . [which] manages the NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory under contract. Originally, the Laboratory and the contract for its operation were transferred to nasa from the Army in 1959. As the functions of the Laboratory have expanded and changed, we have modified the nasa/cit relationships to meet the current needs of the program. The present contract expires at the end of this year, and we have carefully negotiated its extension under terms more applicable to current agency requirements. A comprehensive review has been made of the operating experience gained since the inception of the nasa/cit/jpl relationship. As a result of this study, improved operating procedures in both the technical and administrative aspects have been developed and implemented. In addition to reflecting clauses which implement the above improvements in management, the new arrangements include three major departures from earlier agreements:
“First, the earlier contracts were based on a principle of mutually requiring CIt/jpl concurrence before NASA directions would be carried
out. This often resulted in lengthy ‘negotiations’ of assigned tasks. The new contract restricts the principle of mutuality to the broad terms of the operating relationship, but clearly gives NASA the unilateral right to issue task orders, require reports, and take other administrative actions as desired.
“Second, a separate facilities contract is also being negotiated which will provide the government a more direct control over the planning, construction, and utilization of the facllities at jpl.
“Third, a new principle is provided for determining crr’s fee for the operation of the Laboratory. The new contract contains a schedule which sets llie upper and lower limits of the fee on llie basis of the dollar volume of work which NASA places with cit/jpl. The exact fee within these limits, will be determined by how well cit/jpl performs in the management of llie Laboratory.” (Testimony)

“Of the $20 billion marked for manned space flight in the present decade, $18 billion will be expended for the launch vehicles and spacecraft, the ground facilities, the astronaut training, and the management skills and other human factors that are an integral part of our nation’s capital investment. These are all things we must have—in any event— to achieve the across-the-board competence in every major area of manned space flight that security, well-being, and progress of the nation may demand.
“The portion of this total effort devoted to landing on the moon will cost only about $2 billion—that is, sending three Americans on a round-trip voyage of lunar exploration, along with everything in the way of spacecraft and special equipment that the expedition will require. . . .
“I hope that this brief and somewhat simplified explanation will put the correct price tag on the extra cost of the lunar mission. Let us all
endeavor to put the emphasis where it really belongs: on the rapid growth of American competence in all areas of manned space flight particularly in the area near earth which is the prime importance for national security.” (Text)

“Allliough direct measurements of llie physical properties of the Moon await successful lunar flights, our Earth-based work has continued willi some exciting results. Lowell Observatory scientists detected evidence of gas escaping from three different spots in llie area of the lunar crater Aristarchus. This observation suggests lliat the Moon may be far from inert, and it has an important bearing on how we may conduct our lunar investigation. For example, if the Moon is seismically active, the seismograph may play an important role in llie investigation of the lunar surface. . . .
“Also, much effort was applied to clarifying llie data from Earth-based or balloon observations of Mars. One important subject of controversy developed. Whereas it had been believed previously that the pressure at the surface of Mars is around 85 millibars, where 1000 millibars is roughly one atmosphere of pressure, it is now believed by many lliat the surface pressure on Mars may be as low as 10 or 11 millibars. This has serious implications willi regard to landing a capsule on Mars. If the lower pressure is correct then retrorockets have to be used, whereas willi llie higher pressure atmospheric drag could be used to slow down the incoming capsule.
“Significant new knowledge on llie fundamental physical nature of the universe may have to await the launching of the first oao. In the meantime, sounding rocket experiments continue to provide data in ultraviolet and radio astronomy. . . .
“Allliough the formal development of Scout had been completed, additional work was required to improve its reliability. The primary objective of the December 1963 Scout firing was to determine llie efficacy of llie measures taken to correct observed deficiencies. The virtually perfect vehicle performance during this firing encourages one to look for a high success rate in future Scout firings. . . .
“Performance of all Atlas-boosted launch vehicles would be considerably improved by introducing a mixture of fluorine and oxygen (flox) as the oxidizer. Careful study shows lliis can be done willi admixtures of up to 30% fluorine without major redesign of the propulsion system. We are, llierefore, planning to flox the Atlas. A primary objective of this program is to provide for additional payload in llie Surveyor investigations. . . .” (Testimony)

Considerable effort is concentrated on commercial supersonic transports, a subject of nasa research for many years. Various aircraft configurations embodying widely differing design features have resulted from this research. All of these designs appear promising, particularly with regard to supersonic performance. In September 1963, at the Langley Research Center, the results of preliminary design studies and of related NASA in-house research programs were presented to all interested government agencies and major aircraft manufacturers. In general, it was concluded that a supersonic transport for airline use is technically feasibly.

I can assure you that this type of coordination will continue.
“I would like to emphasize one point, however. The planning for the support of a mission involves so many trade-offs and compromises in launch vehicles, trajectories, weight, complexity, and cost that the fundamental responsibility must lie in the hands of the agency responsible for the program. This is not only true in the case of NASA projects, but it is equally true that dod has to have full responsibility for the planning
and trade-offs on such projects as Discoverer, Dyna-Soar, and the upcoming Manned Orbiting Laboratory. These projects are so complex and the things we are trying to do are so new that divided responsibllity would most seriously jeopardize llie possibility of mission success. . . .” (Testimony)

From either point of view, freedom to engage in scientific activity entails significant social responsibility. . . .
“It is ironic that a consequence of the extension of definite verifiable knowledge, the primary product of science, should be to extend confusion. To increase knowledge, not only adds knowledge where it did not previously exist, but corrects previously held mistaken knowledge and belief. In so doing, it alters the conditions of existence; hence man’s relationship, not only to his physical environment, but to other men.
“Scientists produce the conditions from which these alterations develop. The inescapable responsibility of scientists is to continuously inform society of the knowledge they have, or are trying to create, and to explain its scientific significance.
“The institutional locus and the social role of the scientist has traditionally fulfilled this responsibility. The scientist in the past was, not only a creator of knowledge, but an integrator, a teacher—a transmitter of knowledge. New knowledge could be incorporated in its appropriate context and transmitted more rapidly than it could be produced. Today we have altered these arrangements. . . .
“While slowing down the system for the transmittal of new knowledge and reducing the proportion of the educated populace who have access to the existing system, we are simultaneously speeding up the production of new knowledge. While ignoring the processes of evaluation, integration, interpretation, and assimilation of new knowledge, we have fixedly accelerated the processes of specialized acquisition of new knowledge.
“We have upset the equilibrium between invention and innovation. I submit that the social responsibility of the scientist is obvious: to assist society restore the balance.” (Text)

• Dr. Edward C. Welsh, nasc Executive Secretary, delivered keynote address at the Robert H. Goddard Memorial Dinner. He compared U.S. and Soviet space accomplishments:	-
“1. As regards that key feature of booster power, the Soviets are ahead on an operational basis, although we are moving up rapidly, having attained the current weight-lifting record on a test shot by the Saturn I.
“2. We have placed almost four times as many payloads into earth orbit, while they continue each year to increase their absolute lead in total weight of net payloads orbited.
“3. Our numerical progress in orbiting payloads is impressive. Last year alone, the U.S. put more payloads into earth orbit than the USSR has since Sputnik I in 1957.
“4. The increasing reliability of our launchings is also impressive. During the past three years, we placed successfully into earth orbit 82% of all the payloads which we attempted to put there. The Soviet record, while not identical, is comparable.
“5. The Soviet heavy Vostok class of vehicle has accumulated some 1600 orbits, as compared with 37 for our smaller Mercury. . . .
“6. The Soviets have devoted more of their attention to far-out space than we. have. As a percentage of total space launching attempts, they have devoted five times as much effort to escape-missions to the moon and planets as we have. The opposite is true as to near-earth orbits, in which the U.S. emphasis has been much greater than theirs.
“7. Both countries have made impressive strides in accumulating scientific data about space. We may even be ahead in this regard, but it is not safe to assume so.
“8. The U.S. is dearly ahead in world-wide sharing of space research in cooperative programs, and in direct application of space technology to practical use in communications, weather reporting, geodesy, and navigation.
“In summary, we have made enormous gains in the past few years in the race with our able and aggressive competitor.

Wishful thinking to the contrary, we dare not slow down unless we are willing to pay the terrific price of second place. . . .” (Text)
March 20: General B. A. Schriever (usaf) addressed an Air Force Association squadron in New York City on the subject of “The Air Force in the Years Ahead”:
“A major consideration in long-range planning today is the rapid pace of technical progress. Since the early days of World War II we have been caught up in a massive technological explosion. One of the most important military products of this explosion is the intercontinental ballistic missile, which today forms an increasingly important part of our nation’s strategic forces. . . .
“In addition to its direct contribution to our national security the Air Force icbm development program has created much of the technology, hardware and facilities that have been utilized in the nation’s space program. Most of the nation’s space shots to date have been launched by military boosters from Air Force facilities. The Titan III Standard Launch Vehicle, which is currently under development by the Air Force Systems Command, is based on the technology and experience gained in icbm development.
“The Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) program is the logical next step in military space development. The mol is required, to help us answer basic questions about man’s role in space, such as the length of a time a man can safely remain in orbit, his ability to make full use of his faculties in space, and his ability to perform a useful military function there. . . .” (Text, afsc Release 43-R—32)

I am firmly convinced that the 2,000 complaints . . . would skyrocket if the faa produced sonic booms approaching 3 pounds or more overpressure per square foot. . . .
“Mr. Speaker, I submit that this whole [sst] project must be held in a state of abeyance until after the faa has had the courage to generate sonic boom overpressures in excess of 2 pounds per square foot. . . .”

2	to 3 pounds overpressure per square foot will do damage to glass and plaster in isolated cases and that sonic booms creating overpressure of
3	to 5 pounds per square foot will cause widespread window and plaster damage. But . . .

•	Results and new research of X—15 project were detailed in Astronautics &
Aeronautics article by Thomas A. Toll, Chief of Research Div., nasa Flight Research Center, and Jack Fischel, head of FRC Manned Flight Control Branch.
“. . . In the area of aerodynamics, problems resulting from the heat generated by high-speed flight were of most concern to designers at the time of the X-15 feasibility studies. . . .
“At the time thermodynamic design of the X-15 was first contemplated, it was thought likely that fairly extensive regions of laminar flow might be achieved in flight, thereby alleviating the problem of heat protection as it would exist for an all-turbulent condition. This reasoning was based largely on rocket-model and wind-tunnel results available at the time. These results indicated a stabilizing effect on the boundary layer at hypersonic speeds for low ratios of the surface temperature to the stagnation temperature. As the design of the airplane progressed, it became evident that the probability of obtaining laminar flow would be greally reduced by the presence of unavoidable surface irregularities.
As a basis for the aerodynamic heating design, a relatively low value of the transition Reynolds number (Rr=100,000) was therefore stipulated. Flight results have generally confirmed this design approach, inasmuch as it has been found that at the lower altitudes, where the heating rates are highest, the boundary layer is largely turbulent, due primarily to the surface irregularities. Regions of laminar flow generally are limited to the immediate vicinity of the leading edges and are quite small. The conditions found to exist on the X—15 are consistent with results of refined wind-tunnel techniques now being used. . . .
“Maximum structural temperatures have been experienced during X-15 operation at high speeds and comparatively low altitudes, with accompanying normal-acceleration values much lower than those experienced during recovery from high altitudes. . . .
“By way of assessing die [structural] failures experienced, there appear to have been no cases in which the structure deteriorated to such a degree as to seriously endanger the integrity of the airplane. It is entirely probable, however, that had a less-conservative design been followed the problems noted might have resulted in greater deterioration with more serious consequences. . .

Astrorocket concept employed parallel staging rather than conventional bottom-to-top staging. Martin said advantages of the Astrorocket were its reusability and its capability to operate with existing air bases for space operations. (A-N-AF J&R, 3/7/64, 38)

“. . . in assessing the future one can always learn from the past, and if the thoughtful student of history learns anything from a review of the march of human progress, it is that the ultimate potential of contemporary undertaking is almost never perceived.
“So, I believe, it is with research and exploration in space. . . . “Today, 500 years after Prince Henry and his use of the caravel to initiate die Oceanic Age, 400 years after Copernicus presented his theories about the solar system, 300 years after Newton worked out the formula for space flight, but less than 40 years after Goddard devised the vehicle to make it possible, man has left the earth, and widened his horizons to include the entire solar system.
“Science today has at its disposal a modem caravel, the chemical rocket, which has already traveled to the moon and Venus. And, as with Henry and his explorations, we have improved navigation systems to guide them out and bring them back to make steadily more accurate measurements of the environment of space—that environment through which Gargarin and Glenn and others traveled, and through which our own planet, Mother Earth, is also traveling around the sun at the relative speed of 67,000 miles per hour.
“And to complete the parallel, just as Prince Henry inaugurated an Age of Discovery which led man to all the seas and continents of the earth, and into the atmosphere up to twice the height of his tallest mountains, so have we today embarked on a new Age of Discovery in which there is no foreseeable horizon. . . .” (Text; CR, 4/6/64, 6686)

•	Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower said in Saturday Evening Post
article:
“As a Republican I believe in what has been called the ‘conquest of space,’ but which I prefer to think of as a thorough exploration of a new scientific frontier to improve our living here on earth. This is an exploration we should pursue vigorously with a step-by-step program in line with our means and our needs. That was the aim of the space program as initially undertaken during my Administration: On the advice of eminent scientists we conceived a long-range effort, not a stunt, with costs to be stabilized around two billion dollars a year. That hardly could be called picayune by any reasonable standards.
“But now, under the Democrats, this program has been blown up out of all proportion. With hysterical fanfare our space research has been presented as a crash effort, as a ‘race to the moon’ between the United States and Russia which we must win at all costs. And the costs are tremendous: They now are running well over five billion dollars a year. The Government now has more than 73,000 engineers and scientists working on the nonmilitary space program, either on the federal pay-
roll or employed under contract. This swollen program, costing more than the development of the atomic bom'b, not only is contributing to an unbalanced budget; it also has diverted a disproportionate share of our brainpower and research facilities from other equally significant problems, including education and automation.
“We are breezily assured that the cost and dislocation brought about by this moon race are worthwhile for the new ‘prestige’ they will bring us. There is no way of telling how true that may be, but we can be sure of one thing: The voyage to the moon will set a new record for a trip taken on borrowed money.” {Sat. Eve. Post, 4/11/64, 17—19)

But neither are we going to abdicate our own responsibility for this expenditure of public funds and for the success of the missions.
“We are in a process by which we are both working to solve the problem. If this process produces the kind of organizational changes and the kind of ability to fix organizational responsibility that ... [is desired], then we will go forward. If they don’t both we and jpl will be looking for some other arrangement. . . .
“I think all of us see the total picture better. Each of us tended to see one part of the picture rather than the total picture.” Under the new contract, jpl would be organized more like the NASA Centers. “. . . the United States government cannot find any arrangement under which the high quality of work which jpl has done and is capable of doing in the 700-598 0—65—10
future can be available to the country better than the arrangement that we have negotiated. I hope and believe it will be signed. But I still feel it is my responsibility to make very sure that the contract represents a full meeting of the minds.”
Mr. Webb stressed that he was not singling out anyone for blame for Ranger lunar spacecraft failures. “Our objective is success on the next flight and not to find a scapegoat for this kind of thing.” Of the next Ranger lunar probe, he said, “We are still striving to get it off about June, but there are lots of problems that have to be settled. Some of us feel quite strongly that we must have a very strong assurance of success before we would be ready to launch. But we also run into the problem if we don’t launch then we may have difficulty fitting into the schedule later.”
Asked about effect of the delay in Congressional appropriation of $141 million supplemental requested for FY 1964 manned space flight, he said: “. . . this delay is at least reducing what the President gave us— a fighting chance. I mean, with each passing chance we have a little bit less of a fighting chance to do the job within this decade. ... I would say that costs are going to increase for the same amount of work with each passing month, and that each month roughly delays one month on the other end, or maybe more, and that this does certainly reduce the fighting chance.” (Transcript)

April 15: Thomas E. Dolan, nasc staff member, proposed at aiaa Symposium on Space Stations and Their Logistics Support in Pasadena that “saddlebags” be attached to lem to increase its carrying capacity for use in equipping a lunar base. 3,000-5,000 lbs. of supplies would be attached to manned Lunar Excursion Module. The system would make it possible to set up a lunar base with a 7- to 10-day staytime. He said saddlebags mode would increase total Apollo spacecraft weight by 15,000 lbs., but Saturn V/Apollo system theoretically had growth option of 100% and 15—20% growth was entirely possible. “The LEM saddlebag concept would avoid multiple launches, hardware development programs for unmanned landing systems, dependence on successful unmanned landing system performance prior to manned landings, and dependence on surface rendezvous. As such, the post-Apollo exploration phase could be carried on with higher mission success and with less total investment than that estimated for the other systems.” [M&R, 4/20/64,15; SBD, 4/17/64, 98)

“We are now developing revolutionary new methods of acquiring global information about our environment. The space satellite, although still in its embryonic state, offers a potential for acquiring environmental information over the entire globe in a manner hitherto unimaginable. However, satellites are extremely costly, and their cost will require that ‘ a system be devised for multiple uses. A satellite observational system for environmental purposes will have to serve navigational and geodetic functions, make observations of the weather, probe the oceans, and sound the ionosphere.
“Any observational platform should be put to multiple uses if it is expensive to build and operate. I am thinking not only of space satellites, but also of ships and aircraft. We can no longer ignore the necessity of using expensive platforms to collect data for many geophysical purposes. The concept of an oceanographic survey without a simultaneous atmospheric survey must be abandoned by force of economics alone. . . .” (Text)

stantial market among the airlines of the world and will help to maintain American leadership in the air.

•	Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Sciences and
Applications, said before House Subcommittee on nasa Oversight about Project Ranger:
“. . . From the outset, the concept was advanced. It was conceived to seize the initiative in space exploration from the Soviet as well as to obtain important information about the moon. Had it succeeded, it certainly would have been a major first for this country, and it may still obtain that objective. The spacecraft itself is quite complex. ... It is comparable to the most sophisticated launch vehicles in terms of electromechanical system complexity. Launch vehicles developed in this country have typically taken 20 or more flights to achieve 50% reliability. Some have not done much better than this after many more firings. Indeed, we have read recently that last year there were 13 consecutive failures of the Atlas. In addition, the Discoverer project took 13 attempts to recover its first payload from orbit. Polaris experienced 5 initial failures before its first success. Skybolt experienced 5 flights without achieving complete mission success. In each of these projects, partial success in early flights helped improve later flights. Although I believe Skybolt was dropped for other reasons, Atlas, Discoverer, and Polaris all went on to become vital elements in the defense posture of this country.
“Ranger is going through this same process. We have solved some of our launch vehicle problems to the point where the reliability is improving appreciably. The basic spacecraft bus has been retained and has now demonstrated its capability to deliver a payload to a precise spot on the lunar surface. We now must make the payload work. The payload also is pushing the state of the art in high power television telemetry. This was necessary to obtain high resolution photographs. . . .
“Our reviews of the Ranger system continue to convince us of its capability of performing the mission. While we know we cannot have
100% reliability with launch vehicle, spacecraft, or payload, we expect to achieve at least one complete success with the remaining three flights. . . .
“Ranger is a tough job. Although success has eluded us, it is within our grasp. We must have the fortitude to proceed. Space will only be conquered by those who do have such fortitude. It might be well to point out lliat our competitors in this area of exploration are not lacking in lliis respect. It is reported lliat llie Soviet Union has failed in from 15 to 20 consecutive lunar and planetary mission attempts since Lunik III photographed the back side of the moon in 1959.
“Even should subsequent Rangers fail through unforeseen causes, we must move ahead. We must look at the totality of the space program. . . . The over-all picture is very good and is most convincing of this country’s capability to successfully complete lliese undertakings. The trends are all in our favor. . . .” (Testimony)

The Nerva rocket engine converts nuclear energy to kinetic vehicle energy by passing liquid hydrogen llirough a graphite re-
actor at 6000° R and ejects it through a nozzle. In these devices we will convert as much energy as is converted by the Grand Coulee Dam in a device about the size of an American motor car. . . .” (Text)
Dr. Charles S. Sheldon of nasc staff said in address at the Conference:
“. . . As of April 24, the United States had orbited 203 payloads, and the Soviet Union 65 since 1957. But weight comparisons are quite different. They have put up about three times as much net payload as we have. What is more discouraging, every year for llie last five years, llie lead of the Soviet Union in lliat year has grown larger than it was for the year before. ...
“My 'best assessment is that the Soviet [space] program has close to the same variety of goals as our own, including undertaking very complex missions. Let us look at j ust the main outlines.
“Scientific Exploration in Earth Orbit: . . . The Soviet Union is clearly interested in more llian spectaculars. In llie Earth-orbital regime, it has put up 28 Kosmos class scientific and engineering-test satellites willi a minimum of fanfare, and these have included a range of experiments. . . . Additionally llie pair of Elektron satellites are providing synoptic measurements of the radiation belts out to 40,000 miles.
“Space Applications: When it comes to practical applications of unmanned satellites, llie United States has the lead in demonstrated accomplishments. . . . But similar flight operations are not beyond Soviet capabilities. . . .
“Lunar and Planetary Probes:. . . In absolute number of launchings the Soviet Union has made a larger commitment to such flights llian we have. As a percentage of total flight effort, their commitment for lliat purpose is running about five-fold our own. And they use larger vehicles by far. Take a part of llie comparative planetary effort for example. Of our two launch attempts to date, the 447-pound Mariner II carried about 40 pounds of instruments near Venus and returned some data. We are rightfully proud of this accomplishment.
“The Soviet pattern has been to orbit 14,300-pound platforms from which a probe weighing up to 2,000 exclusive of llie rocket casing can be launched on the interplanetary trajectory. Between 1960 and 1962, ten such launchings were made. Typically, the comparison is a difficult one to make. We met with a great success in Mariner II. Not one of the Soviet craft attained its full objective. . . .
“While neillier country should be overly proud of its lunar probe record, the pictures taken by Lunik III back in 1959 are still a high-water mark.
“Manned Space Flight: . . . Through the 1963 season each country had made six manned launchings, and neither side had killed an astronaut or cosmonaut. Stories to llie contrary are fabrications. . . .
“Human Safety: . . . The Russians sent up williout recovery Laika, four years before Gagarin. The Vostok ship itself completed 100 orbits of fully controlled flight, including successful recovery of four dogs, before llie first man was sent. . . .
“Future Manned Missions: ... To the best of our knowledge, llie Russians have not yet demonstrated a launch system capable of convenient manned flight to the Moon for a landing and return. But then, if we chose to practice Soviet-style security around our launch sites and factories, there would be no hard evidence available to foreigners lliat llie United States is building a lunar capability eillier. . . .
“Because we are not permitted to inspect their facilities, we have to do our best by inference to judge the truth of their repeated statements that they intend to be first in ambitious manned flights. . . . With all this circumstantial evidence I feel it is entirely possible and even probable that they are planning officially to make long-duration and distant manned flights. . . .
“I feel we have the knowledge, the manpower, the resources, and the facilities, to mount the finest space program in the world. I feel it is worth undertaking on its own merits. I am also aware that we are in a race with a competent and tough-minded competitor. We must recognize the nature of this race and organize to meet it, not by year-by-year reactions, but with sound, consistent planning. . . .” (Text)
April 27: At American Physical Society Meeting, the planet Jupiter was reported to be rotating slower. Prof. Alex G. Smith said in 1961 radio sources showed an abrupt change in rotational rate; observations made by radio observatories in Florida and Chile showed that the rotation had slowed by 1.3 sec. Dr. Smith said this was “almost as surprising as if the city of Washington had begun to drift across the surface of the earth at a rate of 10 degrees longitude a year.” Studies were continuing to determine whether Jupiter itself had changed its rotation or whether the change was limited to radio sources.

“The growth of our innovation industry—shorthand for ‘research, development, test and evaluation’—is a measure of the progress of the U.S. toward becoming a research-based society. From the very earliest days of the Republic, it has been recognized that knowledge is power and that the nation grew stronger by taming nature than it could by framing ideologies. So today we have the research society, affluent in the production of knowledge as well as dollars, with planned discovery, innovation, and experiment constantly renewing its vitality and harnessing the future for the benefit of the present. . . .” (Av.

•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb, addressing Texas Technological Col-
lege, said that the role of NASA was “essentially the same as that of its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Both were created in an atmosphere of chagrin and deep concern because prior to World War I and following World War II the nation had forfeited early leadership in a new field of technological opportunity—aero-
nautics in 1915 and space in 1957. In recommending the creation of naca in 1915, a committee of the Smithsonian Institution presented a Memorial to the Congress which began: ‘This country led in the early development of heavier-than-air machines. Today it is far behind. . . .’
“This was at the outset of a war in which, despite the fact that the Wright Brothers had first demonstrated powered flight at Kity Hawk in 1903, the United States had no aircraft design or manufacturing capability of its own. No aircraft of American design or manufacture flew in Europe during World War I, and it remained for naca, in the years which ensued, to provide the basic research and development upon which achievement of ultimate U.S. air supremacy, civil and military, was based. . . .
“The advent of Sputnik I in 1957 revealed that once again, this time in space, the United States had neglected a clear opportunity for technological leadership and to overcome the deficiency, the President and the Congress turned once again to the formula which had proven so effective in aeronautics for more than 40 years. It created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as a research and development agency charged with restoring the nation’s leadership in space by developing the rockets, the spacecraft, the facilities, the scientific knowledge, and the operational skill required. And like naca, nasa has fulfilled its mission to the extent that we have now reached a point of parity in space with the Soviet Union. . . .” (Text)

• Quasars (quasi-stellar objects) were subject of discussion at American Physical Society meeting in Washington. Too large to be stars, too small to be galaxies, quasars emanate tremendously strong radio waves even lliough they are billions of light-years away.
Dr. Peter Bergmann of Yesbiva Univ. said pulsing quasar 3C-273 must have been shining for at least a million years, because it must have taken at least lliat long for llie jet of luminous gas protruding from one side to reach its presently observed lenglli. Dr. Bergmann presented his theory that quasars shine because of gravitational collapse—transformation of mass to energy by gravitation rather llian stellar fusion.
Dr. Louis Gold and Dr. John W. Moffatt of Martin Co.’s Research Institute for Advanced Studies rejected llieories lliat quasars operate on stellar fusion principle, llieorized that “ordered oscillation” was operating inside llie vast gaseous envelopes rimming quasars. Laser effect, or
coherence of particles, occurred in the gaseous envelope, which was about 1 to 10 light years thick. Dense core of quasar must act as fusion furnace, providing particles which acquire coherence on their way to the outside. (Sullivan, NYT, 4/29/64,15; Haseltine, Wtisfi. Post, 4/29/64; Hines, Wash.

•	NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L. Dryden said in keynote address
at Fourth National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space:
“We have chosen to go to the moon because manned exploration of the moon involves every facet of overall space capability this nation must develop if we are to become a leading spacefaring nation. Also, the moon’s pockmarked surface, untouched by water or wind erosion since it has no atmosphere, bears the traces of everything which ever occurred there. . . .
“We are carrying forward an active national space program, not limited to the moon, encompassing science, advanced engineering, practical applications, including manned space flight.
“We are building toward pre-eminence in every phase of space activity—all the way from microscopic electronic components to skyscraper-tall rockets.
“We are building a network of large-scale engineering facilities, space-yards, proving grounds, and space ports to assemble, test, and launch the space vehicles we need now and in the future.
“We are creating new national resources of lasting value in these facilities; in the industrial and managerial capabilities we are developing; and in the growing number of scientists and engineers who are learning about space and space technology.
“We sure filling the pipelines of hardware and knowledge, and as measured by the financial resources required, will be halfway toward our first manned lunar mission by mid-1965.
“We are accumulating, in space, the basic scientific knowledge about the earth, the solar system, the universe, and about man himself.
“We are bringing benefits not only to the United States but to all the world through the use of space and space technology, employing such new tools as weather, communications, and navigational satellites, and applying space-based techniques, equipment, and materials to improve industrial products, processes and services.
“We are providing a much-needed stimulus to the energies and creativity of people everywhere, particularly to the minds and aspirations of young people.	.
“We are bringing about increased economic activity at a time when the effects of automation on our society are beginning to be felt.
“And we are making certain, through our sustained efforts, that the realm of space now opening up to us shall be a domain of freedom.
“It is for these reasons that we have mounted the greatest peacetime undertaking in the history of mankind. . . .” (Text)
April 29: Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, discussed Project Apollo before the Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space:
“The overall time phasing ... is quite conservative. The Apollo spacecraft is being developed on a schedule four years longer than was needed for the Mercury spacecraft, and two years longer than was taken to produce the B-58 bomber. The Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles are being developed on a schedule two years longer than that of the Atlas missile, and a year longer than was required for the Titan. The total duration scheduled for the Apollo program is longer than that of any previous United States research and development effort.
“The Apollo job, of course, is a big one and we will need all of the time allotted. . . . We found . . . that if the remaining six years of work [in Project Apollo] were stretched out over 12 years the total cost of the presently approved manned space flight program would increase by about 30 percent, or about six billion dollars. The economic considerations, therefore, support the maintenance of the present schedule. It is six billion dollars cheaper to continue on the course we are now following than to set out on a new course at this late date. . . .
Among the benefits from Project Apollo is “the rapid advancement of United States capability in space—die ability to undertake whatever space activities the national interest may require.
“There are seven major elements in this capability—people, industrial base, ground facilities, launch vehicles, spacecraft, operational know-how, and the ability to manage research and development. Together, they add up to space power, which provides this country with freedom of action in this new medium. . . .” (Text)

•	Rep. Emilio Q. Daddario (D.-Conn.) said in Air Force and Space Digest
article on technological goals:
“A creative idea may be born in the mind of one man. Of primary importance is the basic and fundamental research necessary to spell out this idea. Here the financial investment is probably the smallest, limited to the man, his instruments, and the time. The amounts of money are relatively modest, except for capital facilities. Indeed, sometimes this money is used and. reused, for basic research is often done in the university climate where its effects nourish graduate students as well.
“The planning, the adaptation, and the oversight of applied research and development is a more resource-consuming operation. By skilled and thoughtful planning project managers can avoid difficulties which tend to drag on important programs. Here the important resource is people, for the decisions are difficult. The history of many important programs in the United States in recent decades affords case studies of matters where waste might have been avoided if top-level people could have anticipated and eliminated specific problems.
“One of the most difficult problems facing the United States is to determine the standards by which we can exercise the necessary judgment to avoid moving into the most expensive areas of technology— development, testing, and production—at an appropriate time to ensure that we do not become prisoners of high costs and unnecessary use of resources. We need to exercise more rigorous standards, more decisive judgment, and action.” (AF Mag., 4/64, 53-56)

Only through such an approach can we hope to reverse the constant escalation of costs that stems from adding persons on both sides of the equation. That is, as the government adds people, the contractor has to add people to respond to our people, and the result is not satisfactory to either side. . . .
“Let me emphasize . . . that there are three factors we want the contractor to be involved in—cost, time, and performance. We want contracts to be written in such a way that industry management will carefully weigh and consider what any change in his operation will do to all three items. Obviously, there cannot be an alteration in any one of them without a concomitant effect on the other two. We feel that only in this way can the present performance be improved at the contractor level. . . .” (Text)

May 4: Appearing at Project Ranger hearings before Subcommittee on nasa Oversight, House Committee on Science and Astronautics, nasa Administrator James E. Webb cited recent management changes by Cal Tech and JPL in the continuing evolutionary process of management relations with NASA: “These changes and continuing improvements are the result of management cooperation and responsiveness over a wide range of complex problems; the new contract we hope to sign soon is a further example of this effort. In this contract, NASA will endeavor to add to the existing system an incentive fee approach, a separate facilities management contract, a joint semi-annual review with err of progress and problems, and a revised overhead determination method. We will discard the concept of mutual agreement at the level of every task and replace it with a contractual statement of our current practice, i.e., laboratory acceptance of NASA program direction, after, of course, a full presentation of its views.
“This represents the position we have achieved in our negotiations looking toward the new contract for the period beginning January 1, 1965. However, nasa has made it clear that it wishes to see the agreed upon relationship put into action prior to final execution of the contractual document. This is a prudent way to avoid overlooking some aspect or approach which might yield better results than those we have reduced to contract language in our negotiations. . . .”
Mr. Webb discussed the report on ranger vi he had sent to Chairman Miller and Chairman Anderson: “This was an important flight; the entire country desired its success. When it did not meet its mission objectives, I felt it was our responsibility to examine the reasons therefore and to report these to the Chairmen of the House and Senate Committees. The report made was the assessment of Dr. Dryden, Dr. Seamans and myself of the technical problems we have encountered and of the possible causes of failure. The Ranger 6 failed because something did not work, not because someone did not work. There had been unstinting effort dedicated to its success; this effort will be combined with lessons learned from the Ranger 6 failure to provide the best assurance of Ranger 7 success. We have invested the energy of some of the best minds of the country in Project Ranger and we "expect to capitalize on that investment in both the near and the far future.” (Testimony)

•	Dr. Alexander H. Flax, Assistant Secretary of llie Air Force for Research
and Development, addressed aiaa in Cleveland: “. . . the number of new systems which can be fully developed is limited. The future, on
the other hand, is highly uncertain. The inevitable result ... is that the number of major weapon systems being developed for the inventory is relatively small. The number of concepts and potential weapon systems being explored in other categories of R&D are very large but still not all inclusive. The approach which we are taking to assure the availability of proven technology and prototypes of critical system elements is through exploratory and advanced development programs; this does not usually include full vehicle or system prototypes although in some cases it may. By working on the critical technical, cost or operational problems of a potential new system intensively while ignoring the other elements of the system, we are placing ourselves in a better position to decide to buy that system and to get it in reasonable time, in the event that either our own national policy, the international situation (especially the actions of our adversaries), or obsolescence arising from new technological developments in counterweapons make necessary the rapid acquisition of a new system, and we are doing lliis at considerably lower cost llian llie cost of developing all the candidate systems even if these developments were at a very low rate. For example research and exploratory development on high energy fuels for both solids and liquids support potential needs both for larger and improved icbms and for new space boosters. The 120" and 156" solid rocket under development by the Air Force and llie 260" solids being supported by NASA provide at llie prototype level the necessary components of much larger ballistic missile and space launch vehicle systems over a wide range of payload capacities. The application of llie 156" solid technology to a new missile in llie Minuteman tradition would provide a payload capability many times lliat of Minuteman. Studies are under way to examine llie payoffs and tradeoffs relating to the application of high energy fuels to a new upper stage suitable for application to both dod and NASA launch vehicles. The aim of lliese programs is to reduce llie degree of uncertainty and the element of risk which would he associated willi the decision to proceed with such systems. Yet lliere is no assurance that these developments will, in fact, be used in llieir present form. They may simply be stepping stones to a later generation of propulsion systems in advanced development. The coupling of requirements for economy, reliability and commonality has led to the dictum for technical advances lliat many are called, but few are chosen. . . .” (Text, dod Release 361—64)

•	At NASA background briefing for news media, Doctors W. Randolph Love-
lace II, Orr E. Reynolds, and Frank B. Voris made presentations on space medicine, biosciences, and effects of space environment on man. Dr. Lovelace described the close working relationship between the offices of Space Medicine, Biotechnology, and Space Science and Medicine. He pointed out Center responsibilities as well as the “detailed task-level technical coordination” completed at the NASA—dod level “which ensures most effective use of all existing facilities” throughout the Nation. In
question period, Dr. Reynolds discussed timing of life-detector experiments for Mars: “. . . we had hoped that it would be possible to have a landing capsule on Mars for the 1966 mission. Just as the plans for that were being developed, questions were raised by recent astronomical data about the density of the atmosphere of Mars that made it very difficult, if not impossible, to design the proper landing system.
“At the present time we are hoping to have a landing vehicle for Mars for the 1969 opportunity. This is not an improved program. But we are working on the development of plans in that direction. It has already been decided that the biological sciences payload, that is, the life detector instruments, or whatever else the biological community thinks are most appropriate for that flight, will have high priority on any landing mission.
“So I think the best guess now would be that certainly our first opportunity would be for 1969, and we certainly hope we will have such instruments aboard.”
Discussing space radiation, Dr. Reynolds said: “. . . a number of committees and meetings that have been held by the radiobiologists in this country have recommended that an experiment be done below the radiation belt carrying a known source of radiation. The reason for this is that there have been reports from organisms, living organisms flown in the natural radiation belt, of a higher than expected effectiveness of the radiation. There is no good theoretical basis for knowing why this should occur. . . .” Experiment for checking this would be flown in first flight of Biosatellite, carrying known source and dosage of radiation below the area of the Van Allen belts. Asked about the previous data, Dr. Reynolds said :
“There are experiments both by United States experimenters in piggyback flights, and the Russian experiments that show a higher than expected effectiveness of the ambient radiation in genetic effect and in systemic effect. These experiments we strongly suspect had this result due to lack of adequate dosimetry, measurement of the actual dosage that was encountered. For this reason the radiobiologists who have been advising us have recommended this experiment with a known source so as to eliminate any question of whether the dosimetry was wrong. . . .”
Dr. Voris discussed “our studies into the biological effects of extremely low magnetic fields and into alternating and high magnetic field forces. Because of a recently expounded theory that individual neurons possess individual and isolated electromagnetic fields of their own, it is conceivable that the functions of the human nervous system may suffer impairment as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields that deviate markedly from ambient terrestrial levels. . . .”
Asked about slow rotation for manned space stations to provide partial gravity, Dr. Voris said that it presented “a problem in disorientation and in the effects of mal de mer. Slow rotation is fine if you can keep your head immobilized and become acclimated to it and stay in one spot. If you move around, move with the turn or away from the turn, or move from the periphery of a circular station into the center, you are changing the field force there, you are developing what is called a Coriolis effect, and you then disturb the balance mechanism or vestibular mechanism of the body and you develop recurrent effects such as seasickness.” (Transcript) .

“Since the scientific investigations of highest priority are in the fields of geology and geophysics, it appears that there is definite value in extending manned lunar exploration by the use of modified Apollo equipment. Experience has shown that geophysical and geological mapping investigations of large areas are Continuing tasks; like the painting of the Golden Gate Bridge, they are never really finished, because new concepts, questions, and methods evolve during the program. The occasionally-expressed view that the major questions about the moon could be settled by a few landings and the return of a few samples ignore the experience of several centuries of terrestrial geology and geophysics. . . .” (Text)
•	Maj. Gen. O. J. Ritland (usaf), Deputy Commander for Space, afsc, dis-
cussed in aas luncheon address the role of usaf in U.S. space program, tracing history of icbm development:
“The task for the Air Force in those early days was a tremendous one. It had full responsibility for the development, acquisition, and deployment of an icbm force capable of deterring any missile threat the Soviets might develop. This meant that we had to develop reliable high thrust boosters, materials that could withstand extreme heat caused by re-entry friction, guidance components, and a host of subsystems for use in our icbm’s. We had to develop command, control and tracking systems, and a wide range of support and test facilities for launch and retrieval. We had to recruit and train a tremendous force of highly skilled specialists and technicians. In addition we had to set up whole new management structures and apply expedited management methods under which these tasks could be accomplished with the greatest possible speed.
“Time was the critical factor. The Soviets had a very substantial advance in technological lead times over us. For this reason it was essential that we have the fullest cooperation and support from all segments of our society. The response to these needs was characteristic of the American people. . . .
“We had tremendous support from many government agencies. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which became the National Aeronautics and Space Agency in 1958, gave unfalling support. For example, naca’s Moffett Laboratories did a major portion of the high speed wind tunnel testing for our nose cone development program. naca’s Cleveland Propulsion Laboratories provided vital support to the Air Force in the rocket engine field. These are just two examples of the highly successful partnership which has evolved between the Air Force as the primary military agency in space and the NASA as the primary civilian agency in space. The partnership continues to be one of the most vital and dynamic aspects of the national space effort. . . .” (Text, afsc Release 45-R—51)

Omitting any mention of when U.S.S.R. might launch major spacecraft, report said past manned space flight had “set some new problems before scientists requiring immediate solution for successful preparation and realization of more prolonged space missions. ...” A major question to be answered was whether it was “possible for an astronaut, after two or three weeks stay under conditions of weightlessness, to endure satisfactorily stresses acting on an organism during re-entry.” Also studies must be made of methods to safeguard astronauts’ cardiovascular systems. Longest section of report was on medical and biological problems of manned space flight; it offered evidence that U.S.S.R. was paying increasing attention to weightlessness and ollier problems of manned space flight.
Soviet report was first such version ever submitted in English and was thought to be strikingly free of propaganda. Possibly significantly, report referred to U.S. space research in correlation with Soviet research ; for example, findings of mars I were said to correlate with findings of U.S. explorer x and mariner ii.

“I cannot overemphasize the importance of incentive contracting as a force for improving nasa’s own planning and decision making processes, as well as the contractors’.
“We expect to write more than $500 million of incentive contracts in the present fiscal year.
“As you know, President Johnson has taken a very personal interest in the cost effectiveness and efficiency of companies which are contractors to the Government. We regard incentive contracting as a primary means for achieving the added efficiency which President Johnson seeks.
“More than incidentally, we think that they can become a primary means for improving contractor profit levels. It is NASA’s policy to let a contractor substantially improve his profit ratios if he can achieve the incentive targets which we mutually establish. Some recent targets which we have established will permit the contractor to more than double the profit ratio . . ., if all incentive targets are achieved.” (Text, CR,5/12/64,10308-11)

“Often in our discussions of the Space Program we refer to the ‘manned program’ and the ‘unmanned program.’ We even talk about manned space science and unmanned space science. Strictly speaking, this is loose talk. There is, in fact, no such thing as unmanned science. Man and his thinking are the prime ingredients of science.
“In the Space Program, it becomes simply a matter of where the man is in relation to his instruments and measuring devices. For those space missions that we call unmanned, man is back on earth while his eyes and ears and other senses are extended electronically and mechanically far out into space by the spacecraft and its instrumentation. From his remote position, he must monitor, issue commands, receive and record data, make routine or emergency decisions as required in a continuing interchange with his inanimate partner out in space.
“It is to make this partnership effective and productive of data, measurements, observations, and information that a centralized facility like llie sfof is necessary. . . .” (Text)

•	In speech to cospar on the NASA Biosatellite Program, Dr. Dale Jenkins,
Bioscience Programs Div., NASA Office of Space Science and Applications, remarked:
“The United States Biosatellite Program is a second generation series of carefully planned and selected experiments, including some highly sophisticated experiments which have required several years of baseline
study and equipment development. This program has been designed to study the biological effects of: (a) zero gravity or weightlessness, (b) the effects of weightlessness combined with a known source of radiation, and (c) removal of living organisms from the Earth’s rotation. These orbiting recoverable Biosatellites provide an opportunity to critically test major biological hypotheses in the areas of genetics, evolution, and physiology. The Biosatellite studies will delineate hazards to astronauts, and determine and define effects on degradation of human performance. Prolonged manned flights, for example, may involve changes observed in ten days of bed rest such as decalcification of bones (particularly the vertebrae), loss of muscle tone and physical capability, and certain cardiovascular changes. The effect of continued sensory deprivation on behavior and performance is unknown.” (Text)

•	Temperature on planet Jupiter was reported to be higher than previously
thought. Geology-astronomy team at Cal Tech that studied the planet with heat-sensitive detector fitted to 200-in. telescope on Mt. Palomar found sunlit atmosphere of Jupiter averaged 230 degrees below zero F. But in shadow cast by one of its moons—Ganymede—temperature jumped to minus 117 degrees. Dr. Bruce C. Murray, associate professor of planetary sciences, and Dr. Robert L. Wildey, research fellow in astronomy and geology, gave two possible explanations for the unexpected rise in temperature: “Perhaps in sunlight the atmosphere is photochemically stable, and the shadow removes the stability. Then the atmosphere may start to break down into more transparent material, permitting the heat detector to observe much deeper into the atmosphere where temperatures are higher. Another possibility is that a breakdown of the shaded atmosphere may result in an upwelling from deeper, warmer zones of the atmosphere.” Study also showed that another of Jupiter’s moons—Callisto—radiated twice as much heat as a normal moon would be expected to do.

May 17: Herbert Friedman of Naval Research Laboratory reported to cospar a new picture of space cosmic rays, based on results of experiments with rocket-borne x-ray telescope. New results showed that less than one
per cent of all cosmic rays could be produced in intergalactic space. Therefore, Friedman said, all cosmic rays would appear to come from exploding stars. He said these findings showed that there were too many x-rays to support theory that x-rays are produced by cosmic rays’ colliding with starlight, and too few x-rays to support theory that they come from the near-collision of electrons and protons (formed by neutron’s disintegration in so-called “hot universe” theory).

“Years ago, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, one of nasa’s ancestors, annually conducted field inspection trips so that the nation’s leaders in aviation could have a first-hand look at the progress in research made by the scientists and engineers of naca.
“Today, we are gathered for a first-hand look at advanced research and technology not only in aeronautics, but also in the new realm of space.
“It is most fitting that the revival of the annual field inspection trip takes place first at the Langley Research Center, for Langley was the first research center of the original naca, and is today, as it was in 1917, working at the frontiers of scientific and technical knowledge. . . .

•	General B. A. Schriever, afsc, said in address to National Space Club:
“There are three facts about the ballistic missile and space effort which I would like to emphasize: first, it has given us today a substantial strategic superiority; second, it has built a base of experience, facilities, and hardware for the national space program; and third, it provides convincing evidence that trained and dedicated people, who are properly motivated, can work together to achieve something that skeptics consider to be‘impossible.’ . . .
“These five factors . . .—awareness of the competition, rapid advancement of technology, acquisition of modern research and test facili-
ties, employment of skilled and dedicated people, and use of streamlined methods of management—all of these were vital to the achievements of our ballistic missile and space efforts during the past ten years. The same factors are vital to any future national effort.
“One very clear lesson emerges from our icbm experience, and it is this—we cannot afford to rest on our past accomplishments. Technology is not standing still. It keeps moving rapidly ahead, and we must keep pace with it. We must make use of our past experience as we tackle the challenges of the future.” (Text, afsc Release 45-R-62)

“At the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it has been estimated that about 40 percent of our booster costs, 70 percent of

Unfortunately, as Dr. Albert Kelley . . . recently pointed out in this same context, a vast majority of our flight failures, not to mention flight delays, arise from electronic failures. Success in this area is obviously a major factor in overall mission accomplishment. . . .
“In space activity the United States is now at the mid-point of a 10-year program. It might be said, in a sense not entirely figurative, that we have reached the ‘mid-course maneuver point.’ Just as the Mariner II Venus fly-by mission would have missed by almost a quarter of a million miles instead of coming within 22,000-mile target area, we can fail to (achieve our full potential if we do not seize every opportunity to correct our course as we go along. . . .” (Text)
May 20: In address to the Wayne State University College of Engineering Honors Convocation in Detroit, Mich., Dr. George E. Mueller, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said:
“In the manned space flight program, we have tried to profit from t)he experience of the past. We are creating this very great capability in advance of the formulation of many of the specific operational requirements, which inevitably will emerge when it becomes clear what can be done. There are many elements to this capability. It includes trained people, a base of industry throughout the United States, ground facilities, launch vehicles, spacecraft, operational experience, and the ability to manage large research and development efforts. All of these things will enable the United States to undertake whatever exploration of space the national interest may require.
“In the three years since 1961, the manned space flight effort has built up at a rapid rate until there are now 250,000 persons at work throughout the country—more than 90 percent in private industry—and their numbers will increase to 300,000 when we reach the peak activity of the presently approved programs next year. About 15 percent of these are scientists and engineers. The program has become a major element in the economic life of the country. Prime contractors assign work to subcontractors, who in turn engage second and third-tier subcontractors.
“As the program progresses, we are now beginning to realize some of the benefits. Whereas six years ago we were extremely limited in the power available to place objects in space, we are now approaching a period when we will have the rockets available to do things beyond those being used in present programs.
“The time is approaching when we must give more thought to the exploitation of the capabilities provided through these efforts. To avoid the pitfall into which we have fallen in the past, we must plan for the future even while we press vigorously to accomplish present programs.” (Text)

“We should slow down in our spending on space, reassess the situation and bring the programs back to a more realistic, down-to-earth 766-598 O—65----13

•	Addressing American Ordnance Association in Washington, Dr. Edward
C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of National Aeronautics and Space Council, said:
“It is my thesis that mutual disarmament—and prudence dictates that there should be no other kind—would greatly increase the flow of funds and effort into space exploration and into the building of greater space capability. This does not necessarily mean a full transfer of all available resources to space applications. But, just for illustration, suppose that there were a 10% decrease in weapon systems spending. With good planning at least half of it could be diverted smoothly and efficiently into an increased space effort. With greater difficulty, the remainder might be directed toward mending other inadequacies in our society. . . .
“I am an avid supporter of the private competitive enterprise system. I also am an avid supporter of a responsible government which creates a climate in which the private system can work efficiently. My proposal to accelerate space activity to offset decreases in weapon system activity does not conflict with my support of private enterprise. In fact, it supports it, even though the funds would pass through government hands in llie process. The basic objective is to strengllien our country. . . .
“In conclusion, let me emphasize:
“First. Disarmament, in the form of decreased production of weapon systems, does not need to cause an economic depression.
“Second. Resources made available as a result of decreased production of weapon systems could most effectively be applied to accelerated development of space systems.
“Third. While it is important to keep private industry heallliy, government financing of research and development is not in conflict willi such objectives. In fact, it may well stimulate increased production and increased employment by private companies.
“And finally, I do not suggest that there should be a sharp increase in spending for space. But I do believe space spending should increase af a rate at least consonant willi the increase in our gross national product, not only because increase in the gnp makes resources available for more space activities, but also because space exploration itself stimulated llie gross national product.” (Text)

“. . . The policy of classifying Soviet space failures was developed largely to protect sources of information, many of which in those days were individuals actually in the Soviet Union.
“Most of the information we get today comes from sources outside the Soviet Union which need no protection. As a consequence, there is less j ustification at the present time for classifying Russian space failures than there was in the past. I am not saying that there is no justification. . . .

“Leadership in propulsion is . . . synonymous with leadership in space—for both military and non-military purposes. We cannot afford to relax in this area. There is no room for complacency, only room for urgency. . . .
“In supporting the thesis that there is real danger from complacency, I list the following points:
“1. The USSR is having some economic difficulties, particularly in agriculture. Yet, their space program is expanding.
“2. The USSR is far ahead of the United States in manned flight experience. Even their female cosmonaut has flown more orbits than all of our astronauts combined.
“3. The USSR has flown their heavier Vostok spacecraft in manned and unmanned flights some 45 times as many earth orbits as we have flown our much smaller Mercury.
“4. Practically all of the competences developed for space could be used for aggression as well as for peaceful purposes.
“Please do not misunderstand what I am saying. We have made great strides, particularly in the past three years. We are actually ahead of the Soviets in some applications of space, such as communications and meteorology. We are, however, not yet ahead overall. But, our rate of progress is very impressive.
“Probably what I am warning about more than anything else is the danger lliat we might slow down our rate of progress—that we might heed the voices of defeatism and impracticality. This is the one thing we cannot afford. We cannot afford to lose the momentum which stems from a growing program. To slow down is to be content with second place. This we should not do. In fact, we dare not do it.” (Text)

•	General Bernard A. Schriever, afsc, said in speech to the Aviation/Space
Writers Association in Miami, regarding the USAf/usn F—111:
“The outstanding characteristic of the F—111 is its versatility. The F—111A—the Air Force version—can penetrate supersonically on the deck for interdiction or low altitude tactical reconnaissance. For purposes of close support, it must be able to maneuver well at low altitudes and be able to carry a variety of conventional weapons. It must also be able to loiter for extended periods while awaiting target assignments from llie local ground commander. Combined willi lliis low altitude capability, the F-lll requires a very high altitude capability for reconnaissance flexibility and air superiority missions. It must be capable of high altitude deployment between llieaters williout tanker support.
“The F-1I1A will significantly increase the Air Force’s capability in support of the Army. Its great ferry range will increase Tactical Air Command’s capability to react even more rapidly than now to meet contingencies anywhere in the world. But even more importantly, the F—111A, with its variable geometry wing design will operate effectively over a wide range of speeds and altitudes in any conservative combat environment.
“Basically the F-lll will be the first truly multi-purpose all-weather tactical fighter in tac’s inventory with a capacity to operate from short austere fields. This means greater dispersal and flexibility and, of course, quicker responsiveness to support Army requirements for immediate and effective close air support, air superiority and interdiction. In short, the F—111 represents a quantum step forward in the development of a tactical air weapon system providing optimum combat effectiveness at the lowest cost and with the greatest possible flexibility.
“The F—111B—the Navy version—has a primary role of air superiority. It will be armed with the Phoenix missile system and will be able to loiter at the outer defensive perimeter of the fleet for much longer periods of time than present day Navy fighters. It will also be able to accelerate out of a subsonic loiter condition and maneuver for supersonic attack.
“It is easy to see that both the Air Force and Navy versions of the F-lll call for a number of conflicting inflight performance characteristics. The requirements for high subsonic cruise efficiency and for short takeoff capability call for maximum lift from the wing area. In other words, you need wings swept fully forward. On the other hand, supersonic low altitude flight calls for swept back wings, since the body design itself provides sufficient lift to support flight; and additional wing area only induces instability. At altitude more wing area is required, but the higher speeds obtainable dictate either very thin straight wings or else a higher degree of sweep.
“How do you answer these conflicting demands? The answer is obvious—develop a variable sweep wing aircraft. Contrary to some impressions, the variable sweep design is not new. A variable sweep design was used in the Bell X-5, which was developed under Air Force sponsorship and flown at Edwards in 1951. A similar principle was utilized in the Grumman F—10F prototype which flew in 1952. But there is a major difference between those designs and the one to be used in the F—111. The early designs required a bulky internal mechanism to move the wings. That mechanism is not required for the newer designs, and consequently the use of a variable sweep wing has become practical.” (Text, afsc Release 45-R-64)
May 26: Kingman Brewster, Jr., president of Yale Univ., testified before the House Subcommittee on Science, Research and Development of the Committee on Science And Astronautics:
“. . . if we would do our best to see to it that the Government’s support of scientific activity distorts as little as possible the competitive allocation of talent in the scientific market place, we must not penalize the universities in competition with industrial and consulting firms; and we must not penalize the less well endowed or supported universities in competition with their richer rivals. Anything less than full reimbursement of indirect costs [of research] does exactly this.”
He continued: “. . . it seems to me wholly unwise to permit considerations of political geography to control the choices of faculties and students alike, to keep them from working wherever they think they would be most productive. Because the excellent are so few, and because modern science cannot very often be pursued in isolation from a community of one’s peers, a productive science policy is bound to lead to a high degree of concentration in relatively few centers of advanced education and research.” (CR, 6/17/64, A3307)

May 28: Saturn I SA-6 flight was conducted successfully from Cape Kennedy, the huge two-stage launch vehicle boosting into orbit an Apollo boilerplate spacecraft attached to the S-IV second stage. The one malfunction in the flight was premature shutdown of one of the eight first-stage engines, cutting off 24 sec. early. Preliminary analysis of telemetry data indicated that the remaining seven H—1 engines burned additional two sec. to compensate for lost thrust of the eighth engine, and the Saturn I’s guidance system corrected course deviations caused by the shutoff engine, so that orbital parameters (140-mi. apogee, 123.9-mi. perigee,
88.5-min. period, and 31.8° inclination to the equator) came very close to those predicted. This was first Saturn I flight test of active guidance system to inject upper stage and attached Apollo spacecraft into orbit. Eight movie cameras mounted on the Saturn I to photograph propulsion and fuel operations were ejected and recovered. Main purpose of the flight was further qualification of the Saturn I launch vehicle and continued development of technology necessary to build the more powerful Saturn IB and V launch vehicles, (Marshall Star, 6/3/64, 1; NASA Releases 64-113 and 64-130; M&R, 6/8/64,10)

Mueller, addressed banquet of Aviation/Space Writers’ Association in Miami. Discussing possible hazards to Apollo astronauts, he said that based on data from explorer xvi satellite it was “not anticipated at this time that meteoroids will constitute a major problem in the planning or scheduling of the first manned lunar exploration.” Radiation did not present a hazard either: “. . . In the case of solar flares, we compared the allowable safe dose with what would have been produced within the Apollo command module by the worst flares on record, that of July 1959. If an Apollo spacecraft had been in flight on a lunar mission at this time, the astronauts would have received only 15 percent of the safe dose, calculated on the basis of a report by a group established by the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences. . . .
“Very recently there have been suggestions that space flight—even relatively short duration flight—is harmful to man. There is no evidence from Project Mercury to support these fears. Based on our experience in Mercury, which included a flight of 34 hours by Gordon Cooper, there is no reason to believe that flights of two weeks or less will be harmful. . . .”

May 30: nasa Administrator James E. Webb addressed Missouri Cotton Producers Association in Sikeston, Mo.:
“Whether the Russians are attempting to build a rocket and spacecraft to match Saturn V and Apollo, we simply do not know. When they start flight tests of such a rocket, we should be able to identify it. Flight tests of our Saturn V will not begin until llie 1967-68 period, and it is quite possible that the Russians may also be testing a super rocket by llien.
“This much we do know: It would be very foolish on our part to sit idle or to delay the Saturn V until we could confirm that the Soviets were also building super rockets. By that time, it would probably be too late for us to match them again in lliis century.
“In our national space program we are moving rapidly and vigorously to do llie lliings we need to do as a nation to prevent technological surprise, to prevent anollier major Soviet initiative based on space superiority.
“We believe lliat peace and security and the possibility of useful cooperation with llie Soviet Union all depend on our making doubly clear that lliey can hope to have no monopoly of space achievement to exploit for llie purposes of communism.
“Some people seem to think that our present space effort can be justified only if we are in a neck-and-neck race to the moon. These people miss the point. Our aim is not to race the Soviets, but to thoroughly discourage them from making an all-out effort to use space as a political, propaganda, or military weapon for greater power on earth.

launch vehicles: “. . . In any head-to-head clash between the two programs, Saturn IB must be considered the favorite. Titan III-C’s quick reaction capability may be handy some day, but not in the next few years, since there are no military manned spacecraft to do the reacting. Saturn IB starts out with a 25% payload advantage and it has considerably more ‘stretchability.’ For instance, adding the same 120-inch solid motors in the Titan III-C design to the Saturn IB’s lower stage would permit boosting 65,000 pounds into a 100-mile earth orbit. Other improvements being considered could give IB a 120,000-pound earth orbit capability.
“Thus, Saturn IB poses a threat to continued development of the only heavy payload military launch vehicle. (A—N—AF J&R, 6/13/64, 15)

Aside from the very obvious race with Russia to be first to land on the moon; in addition to advancing science to the point where we may locate life on another planet and might discover the secrets of the beginnings of mankind; and besides the use of space to defend ourselves militarily—besides all these reasons, the U.S. space program will bring us two ollier exceedingly important dollars and cents 'benefits: a sizable advance in industry and employment. And an as-yet uncalculated fallout in new civilian products. . . .” (Text, CR, 7/2/64, A3690-92)

•	John H. Boynton of MSC discussed pilot’s role in Mercury space flight sys-
tems failures, in paper to aiaa first annual meeting. He summarized: “For the two unmanned missions, MA-4 and MA-5, control system difficulties made impossible the successful completion of a three-pass orbital flight, which was the design mission for the Mercury spacecraft. But in both cases, the presence of a pilot and the capability to control the spacecraft attitudes manually would have made die three-pass mission possible. This fact was demonstrated in the MA—6 mission in which a similar malfunction occurred hut in which the astronaut completed the flight by using his manual control modes. . . .
“For the MA-6 mission, . . . the flight would undoubtedly have been terminated before the planned time because of an excessive rate of fuel consumption in the automatic control mode. In the successful MA—7 flight, manual initiation of the retrorocket-ignition sequence prevented the horizon scanner malfunction from significantly delaying this critical event. Although an error in yaw angle caused the spacecraft to land somewhat beyond the planned landing area, this error would have undoubtedly been much greater had the pilot not been present. The six-pass MA—8 mission was successful, although a problem of an abnormal increase in suit temperature could have terminated the flight early had no means been available for reducing this temperature. The pilot, however, was able to correct this situation by manual adjustment of his coolant flow valve. Short circuits in the automatic control circuitry during the MA-9 flight made it essential for the pilot to control the spacecraft manually during retrofire and reentry.” (Text)
June 29: C. A. Syvertson and David H. Dennis of NASA Ames Research Center, in paper for aiaa first annual meeting, reviewed problems of atmospheric entry, atmospheric exit, and atmospheric cruise, suggesting that “future vehicles in each of these areas will differ significantly from their current-day counterparts. For example, entry vehicles for use in the interplanetary missions which may follow the lunar mission will enter the Earth’s atmosphere at speeds up to twice that of Apollo. At these speeds, radiative heating predominates and dictates the use of more slender configurations than the very blunt Apollo. The interplanetary entry vehicles will also require very precise guidance and control both when approaching the Earth and when flying within the atmosphere. ...
“For cruise aircraft that follow the supersonic transports, the most characteristic feature will be the probable use of hydrogen fuel. This high-energy fuel provides excellent payload and range capabilities for transports flying up to about twice the speed of the supersonic transport. The low density of the fuel results in aircraft with very large fuselages which may be twice the size of current-day subsonic jet transports.” (Text)

June 30: Atlas-Centaur 3 (AC-3) was launched from ETR in partially successful development test which NASA officials termed “highly successful from an engineering point of view.” Five of the six primary objectives were fully achieved: nose fairing and insulation panels withstood flight-loads and jettisoned properly ; structural integrity of Atlas and Centaur stages during all phases of flight were verified; Atlas-Centaur separation operated satisfactorily; operation of the guidance system was demonstrated; and capability of Atlas-Centaur to be launched at scheduled time was demonstrated, the vehicle lifting off only four minutes after pre-planned launch time. The sixth, partially-achieved objective was ignition and burn of Centaur stage’s two RL-10A3 liquid hydrogen engines: They ignited properly but cut off 127 sec. before programed 380 sec. bum time. Four seconds after engine ignition, hydraulic pump to engine actuators had failed, so that hydraulic system did not actuate the engine swiveling mechanism to maintain control of the stage during powered flight. The Centaur began to roll. Increasing roll motion forced propellant to side of propellant tanks, uncovering feed-line outlets; engine cut off after 253 sec. because of lack of fuel. Stage maintained its trajectory, however, and at programed cutoff time thfe stage attitude control system regained roll control and remaining inflight events occurred as planned. Because of the shorter engine burn, AC-3 reached speed of only 11,425 mph instead of the 17,400 mph which would have put it, incidentally, into orbit.

June 30: NASA Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., said at aiaa Luncheon in Washington: “. . . the concept of the lunar landing was not new when nasa was founded in 1958. Research was continuing on the various technical aspects of such a mission. In 1959, inhouse work began on mission definition. In the fall of 1960, three six-month feasibility design study contracts were awarded. In January 1961 NASA received these interim findings. There were two basic vehicle approaches to be considered—direct ascent and rendezvous. In May of 1961, the study contract results were available, and supported our interim findings, and the recommendation was made to the Congress that the nation proceed with the mission. . . .
“There will be missions after Project Apollo. We are already examining their feasibility, cost, and potential return. We are carefully establishing a variety of future space missions, both manned and up-manned, that exploit the near earth, lunar, and planetary environments. No decisions have been made and we are not ready to recommend them yet. As the information becomes available and as the results are analyzed, we will be able to present the country with a solid spectrum of achievable, well-conceived mission alternatives and options. The selection will be a national, not an agency, decision.” (Text)

•	A. 0. Tischler, NASA Director of Propulsion and Power Generation, said
in paper for aiaa :
“At this time the United States stands on the threshold of transport in the space environment. Until now, with the exception of a relatively few payloads such as Syncom, payloads launched into space were put on their trajectory by the launch vehicle. Only minor path corrections were applied by the on-board propulsion systems. Even the Mercury capsule returns were made by a relatively minor slowing of the orbiting capsule, with aerodynamic braking providing the rest of the kinetic energy change. However in Gemini which may fly with men this year, and which will later effect rendezvous of separate payloads in space, and in Apollo, which will perform an intricate series of space maneuvers, we recognize systems that carry significant propulsion capability into space for use entirely in that environment. The time is rapidly coming when space is no longer something we throw darts into but is an environment in which working propulsion systems will maneuver and transport spacecraft payloads and eventually convey these payloads back to the earth’s atmosphere for descent to the surface to be used again. . . .
“[Space] . . . booster engines have passed, or in the case of the Saturn V engines, are approaching their preliminary flight rating tests, while the more conservative spacecraft propulsion systems have not yet arrived at that milepost. While these spacecraft engines may be expected to come along at a faster pace than the big booster engine developments, the fact is that they are presently in a tail chase situation.
I think we must observe that at this moment the status of spacecraft propulsion systems under development lags the development status of launch vehicle engines and is additionally behind in performing sophistication. That is the area that warrants propulsion attention.” (Text)
June 30: Paper surveying space nuclear propulsion by Harold B. Finger, James Lazar, and James J. Lynch of NASA and aec was presented to AIAA.
“. . . a major forward step has been taken in the milestone established by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in its design, development, operation, and analysis of the KIWI-B4D nuclear rocket reactor experiment. This test provides good reason for confidence in the successful execution of the tests to be conducted this year and next and provides a good basis for confidence in the availability of nuclear rockets when they will be required for the performance of advanced space missions. The availability of these nuclear rocket propulsion systems will give this country a propulsion capability far advanced over any other rocket propulsion system available. . . .
“Progress has been made in electric propulsion, particularly in the thrustor area, but important research data and technology are also beginning to be provided in the difficult area of nuclear reactor electric generating systems required for prime electric propulsion in space.
“Beyond these systems, other advanced nuclear propulsion concepts are not yet well enough understood to justify undertaking significant development efforts. Careful and systematic accumulation of research information to evaluate the feasibility of these concepts and to arrive at a real understanding of them appear appropriate.” (Text)
• Appearing before Special Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution of the Senate Committee on Public Works, NASA Assistant Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology John L. Sloop said:
“The NASA activities having a bearing on air and water pollution are almost entirely in the area of nuclear and chemical propulsion. Even in this area, however, only a fraction of the work offers a pollution threat.
“With regard to water pollution, it is standard practice at NASA Centers and in the rocket industry to capture water used in test operations and, if necessary, treat it before re-use or discharge.
“In considering air pollution, the NASA uses two approaches:
“ (1) Isolated locations and atmospheric dispersion, and “(2) Containment and neutralization. . . .
“In . . . our nuclear propulsion activities, neither routine reactor development testing and flight operations nor conceivable accidents are expected to release sufficient radioactivity into the atmosphere to constitute a hazard to public health and safety.
“In chemical propulsion, there are some propellants that are toxic prior to combustion and some rocket exhausts that contain toxic products. Fortunately, the NASA space program is primarily concerned with non-toxic propellants. In our largest program, the Apollo effort, for example, the giant Saturn I and V boosters both bum oxygen and kero-
sene in their first stages and oxygen and hydrogen in their upper stages. The Apollo spacecraft uses toxic nitrogen tetroxide and a mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, but the quantity is small compared to that used by the Saturn boosters . . . [and is not used] until the Apollo is well into space under normal operation. . . .
“In most rocket testing and in vehicle launches, the rocket exhausts directly into the atmosphere. The very high exhaust temperature and velocity serve to rapidly disperse the exhaust products. In some rocket testing we must simulate the low pressures encountered at altitude. In these facilities, the rocket exhausts into a duct where there is an opportunity to scrub the products with water before discharging into the atmosphere. A unique facility, an example of the containment and treatment method for use in populated areas, was built at the Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, for rockets using fluorine. This facility, put into operation in 1956, was designed to handle hydrogen-fluorine rockets up to 20,000 pounds thrust. . . .” (Testimony)
June 30: Vernon G. MacKenzie, Chief of Public Health Service’s Div. of Air Pollution, testified before Senate Committee on Public Works’ Special Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution that investigation should be made of “suitable means” to insure that rocket-fuel development tests by private organizations be conducted under “suitably controlled conditions.” He said phs had “full confidence” that Federal agencies would apply appropriate precautions of health protection of rocket fuels “insofar as these are under the direct control of Federal agencies.” He named beryllium among “the most toxic and hazardous of the nonradioactive metallic substances used in industry today,” and cited also fluorine as a potentially dangerous component.

During June: Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, said in Scientific American article on the supersonic transport that nasa Langley Research Center and Ames Research Center had “devised several aerodynamic designs for what they call a scat, which is an acronym for ‘supersonic commercial air transport.’ Four of these designs, known as scat’s 4, 15, 16, and 17, are the products of eight years of research. Each design has characteristics that make it somewhat different from the others.. . . .
“nasa engineers conducted extensive wind-tunnel tests of the four scat models at the Langley and Ames centers to evaluate and compare their aerodynamic characteristics. ... It is evident that we must discover how to combine the supersonic L/D [lift-drag ratio] characteristics of scat 4 with the subsonic performance of scat 16. We are optimistic that this can be done. . . .
Discussing special structural problems of sst designs, Dr. Bisplinghoff said the metal fatigue would be accelerated under exposure to high temperatures of supersonic flight, hut at the same time it was essential that the airframe provide safety and serviceability for more than 10 yrs. or 30,000-50,000 hrs. flying time.
“Prolonged screening of materials by nasa’s Langley and Lewis laboratories has identified a titanium alloy that appears to meet the unique and stringent requirements for strength, stiffness and high temperatures of an sst. The alloy contains 90 percent titanium, 8 percent aluminum, 1 percent molybdenum and 1 percent vanadium. . . .” (Sci. Amer., 6/64)

•	Article written by Sen. Barry Goldwater, Republican nominee for President,
in which he laid down his views on the form the U.S. space program should take, appeared in Science and Mechanics: “The concept that speeding men to the moon is the same as jockeying trotters over a muddy track must be abandoned, regardless of Kremlin propaganda. The idea that we can cooperate with the Russians to do the job quicker and cheaper is too ludicrous for comment. We are spending entirely too much money on the manned moon program, when a carefully plotted program using unmanned lunar landing equipment could steadily build up a solid body of scientific knowledge about the lunar environment that would increase the safety factor for astronauts much later. Automatic landing equipment could be designed at minimum cost. The program should expand in easy steps, each one leading to the next. The billions of dollars thus saved could be profitably invested in other aspects of space research.”	,
Speaking of the military role in space, he said: “All manned space research should be directed by the military, willi national security and control of llie access to space as primary goals. The threat from space now and in the foreseeable future is from spatial regions williin a lliousand miles of Earlli and not from lunar distances. Routine daily surveillance of lliese regions must be established, and llie additional capabilities of positive identification, interception, and destruction of
hostile enemy space vehicles will be necessary. This would be the greatest deterrent to an enemy’s military space aspirations. It would also give us the means of developing experienced space pilots, scientific and technological methods, and new scientific knowledge which could be used later in sending men to the moon and the planets. The hardware, on a routinely reliable basis, would be available ofi-the-shelf.
“It might be added that almost every successful NASA launch to date, manned and unmanned, has been made with military support—with missile rocket-boosters, launch facilities, technical know-how, communications (including air transport of boosters) or safety procedures—or with all five. . . .
“Finally, I believe that an immediate initial step of any effective military space program must be a manned station in near orbit about the Earth, with necessary support equipment. . . .”
Senator Goldwater also stated that in his opinion there was the need for two crash programs in space research. The first would develop the Nike-Zeus antimissile missile, and the second would develop the potentiality of lasers for use as military weapons. (Science and Mechanics, 6/64; Wash. Post, 7/21/64)

the first United States satellite launching, the Explorer-Jupiter C, and continuing through the Thor, Atlas, Thor-Delta, and Thor-Agena to the Saturn V in 1968 through 1970, the cost of payload in orbit will be reduced by about three orders of magnitude.
“This remarkable decrease in costs results from the growing reliability and operational effectiveness of our launch vehicles and from the trend towards larger and larger weight-lifting capacity. The relative increase has been greater ”	’ je vehicles because of the economies
associated with their operation.”
Regarding the extension of capability of existing launch vehicles, Mueller reported: “Basically, our launch vehicle technology is sound, and it is advancing in an orderly, evolutionary fashion. We have mastered the design, manufacturing, transporting, checking out, and launching of small, medium, and large launch vehicles.
“Existing space boosters have done a creditable job. Engine reliability has been exceptionally good; the clustering of relatively large numbers of engines is now a proven technology; uprating of engines in thrust and efficiency has been possible; and further uprating can be accomplished to meet additional payload demands.
“We are developing a basic launch vehicle industrial and technological capability that can be extended and expanded for both future space exploration and exploitation.
“For the future, we are building on today’s firm foundation. New high-energy propellants and nuclear rockets have great promise. Large solid-propellant motors are being employed. Much progress is being made in correlating high-energy propellants and engine materials and engineering technology.
“Increased emphasis will be placed on management and the development of reliability. Management responsibilities will continue to grow more complex, while cost effectiveness will continue to be stressed. A smaller inventory of vehicles will be developed which have greater reliability and broader utility.
“All in all, we can look forward to a new and challenging era of progress in launch vehicle technology.” (Text)

He was called “a symbol of our aerospace success.”
In his address at the aiaa Honors Night Banquet, Dr. Dryden said that those involved with our space program must consider broad national goals in addition to scientific details. Other goals mentioned by Dryden were “to obtain maximum benefit to the welfare of the Nation and to all mankind” and “to provide not only material benefits to free man in a peaceful world, but also incentives for mental and spiritual growth and accomplishment.” While recalling the day about 40 years ago, “when an airplane was essentially the product, from concept to final machine, of one man, the designer with the aid of two or three assistants,” Dr. Dryden said today’s space technologist “. . . must search for knowledge of the facts, conduct our work with devotion to intellectual honesty and objectivity, and realize in our activities the highest moral aspirations and ideals of which we are capable.”
Dr. Dryden expressed confidence that the Nation would continue to support comprehensive space exploration program because of sum total of goals space planning strove for. These included national prestige, national defense, human knowledge of space, development of efficient space vehicles, and utilization and international exchange of technological information. He added: “I believe that the rate and scale of the program are not excessive in view of the great resources of this country.” (aiaa, The Louis W.

•	In Aviation Week editorial, Robert Hotz said that until the past two years
most nations in the world considered space technology to be monopoly of the competing U.S. and U.S.S.R. Now they were beginning to participate in space programs themselves.

Hotz saw international space cooperation as the most powerful force binding nations of the world if early promise of international space technology is realized.
“Perhaps the most heartening aspect of the international expansion of space activity is the manner in which the hard technical and financial facts are persuading nations to work together on cooperative projects ranging from global satellite systems to booster development and scientific exploration.
“Part of this has been achieved through the NASA international cooperation program for which Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy NASA Administrator; Arnold Frutkin, head of the international programs office of NASA; and Dr. Harry Goett, director of Goddard Space Flight Center, deserve special credit.

“In the present century, the lag from basic discoveries to applications has become progressively shorter. The Space Age is still further reducing the lag.
“Two major programs are under way to meet the Congressional mandate for the widest possible dissemination of the results of space activities. The first aims to make available the primary technical data to aerospace scientists and engineers. The second repackages the information and moves space-generated technology out of the agency’s laboratories and the plants of its contractors into the non-space industrial complex.
“NASA collects, organizes, and disseminates scientific and technical information on its in-house and contractor work by means of the latest in computer, microfilm, and other methods. Decentralization with local access is the keynote.
“To be of most use this information must be identified and repackaged to meet the special needs of nonaerospace industries. This is the purpose of the Technology Utilization Program, the first national program of its type. Staffs at each NASA Center are systematically organizing the reporting of new or improved ideas, materials, methods, and technology developed in the course of research and development activities. The more promising reports go for analysis to a group of industrial research institutes familiar with current industrial needs and requirements. If the analysis indicates promise, reports are published and indexed so that they are readily available to any segment of the economy that may find them useful.
“NASA is making significant contributions to the growth of science and technology in most major fields. More important, NASA is dealing with the organization and utilization of expanding knowledge in a highly advanced and, we believe, very effective manner.” (Text)

•	The Federal government was critized by National Academy of Sciences
committee for plunging into such major undertakings as a moon expedition or a supersonic airplane without assessing the effects on the Nation’s limited scientific and engineering manpower resources. The study, made public by President Johnson, said that since the Govern. ment supported about three fifths of all those engaged in research and development, it had a “massive influence” on the deployment and utilization of scientists and engineers. This, in turn, imposed an “entirely new order of responsibility” upon the Government to prevent “malutili-zation” of the manpower and to achieve a “balanced allocation of scientific and engineering talent.” Two of the committee’s principal recommendations:
(1)	Steps be taken by the Executive Office of the President to develop an integrated program for collecting and analyzing information about scientific and engineering manpower.
(2)	“Before the government reaches a decision to undertake a great technological program, it should make a careful assessment of the impact of the decision on the deployment and utilization of scientists and engineers.”
Nowhere in its report did the committee suggest that the lunar expedition had unduly diverted manpower from other fields; in fact, the report showed that slightly less than 30 per cent of the Nation’s scientists, engineers, and secondary school teachers of science and mathematics were engaged in defense, space, and atomic energy research, and that space accounted for less than 5 per cent.
The study, an outgrowth of a request by President Kennedy in 1961 for a review of the Nation’s scientific and engineering manpower resources, was prepared by a 17-man committee headed by Dr. James R. Killian, Jr., science adviser to former President Eisenhower and now chairman of the corporation of mit. (Finney, NYT, 7/12/64, 1, 33; Carey, AP, Wash. Post, 7/12/64)

•	In a speech before the Briefing Conference on Government Contracting for
Research and Development sponsored by the Federal Bar Association and the Bureau of National Affairs, Inc., in Boston, Ernest W. Brackett, NASA Assistant Deputy Associate Administrator for Procurement Policy, spoke of NASA’s policy towards incentive contracts: “Incentive contracts are not the answer to everything, but much good can and will come from them. They will effect more realistic cost proposals. When a company’s incentive fee or profit is based on its cost proposal, it will not be on the low side. This means less cost overruns which are subject to so much criticism and which disrupt Government budgets. . . . There will also be more careful and detailed work definitions because a contractor wants to know what he is expected to do and be able to price it out if his incentive fee depends on performance and cost. It takes longer to negotiate incentive contracts and negotiations are harder. . . . Government personnel will be more careful, particularly in the technical areas, when incentive provisions are included. Another advantage should be fewer controls by Government over contract administration details, such as approval of overtime or sub-contractor selection. NASA would like to see contractors make higher profits but wants to have proof they have earned them. The health of the aerospace and electronics industries depends on their realizing a reasonable return for what they do. Incentive methods of contracting appear to be the best way this can be done.” (Text)

Ultimately, laser beams may transmit vast quantities of information instantaneously in the form of light through hoselike cables. . . .
“Such advances will inevitably bring about basic transformations in fields far beyond those in which computers function today. Matching the technical prospects to the human environment, I see society making profound adjustments in many directions. The five main areas affected are likely to be: Work, leisure, education, health, and politics. . . (Text; CR, 8/3/64, A4051-53)

Senate floor: “If our nation is to remain strong and a leader of men, then it is necessary that we maintain a position of leadership in the greatest adventure of our time.
“Not only would a slowdown in this program have an adverse effect on U-S. leadership, but it would cost the taxpayer more money. NASA estimates that for every year the program is stretched out a billion dollars would have to be added to the program. That is not surprising. Any major r&d program requires a tight timetable if it is to Be an efficient program and provide the necessary incentive. Without a tight timetable the work drags on through repeated changes and indecision. As in most human endeavors the establishment of a tight schedule in fact provides assurance that the program will in fact be accomplished.

successful development of an advanced, long-range reconnaissance aircraft to be employed by Strategic Air Command:
“This system employs the new SR—71 aircraft and provides a long-range, advanced strategic reconnaissance plane for military use capable of worldwide reconnaissance for military operations.
“The Joint Chiefs of Staff, when reviewing the RS—70, emphasized the importance of the strategic reconnaissance mission. The SR-71 aircraft reconnaissance system is the most advanced in the world.
“The aircraft will fly at more than three times the speed of sound. It will operate at altitudes in excess of 80,000 feet. It will use the most advanced observation equipment of all kinds in the world.
“The aircraft will provide the strategic forces of the United States with an outstanding long-range reconnaissance capability. The system will be used during periods of military hostilities and in other situations in which the United States military forces may be confronting foreign military forces.
“The SR—71 uses the same J—58 engine as the experimental interceptor previously announced, but it is substantially heavier and it has a longer range.
“The considerably heavier gross weight permits it to accommodate the multiple reconnaissance sensors needed by the Strategic Air Command to accomplish the strategic reconnaissance mission in a military environment.
“This billion-dollar program was initiated in February, 1963. The first operational aircraft will begin flight-testing in early 1965, and deployment of production units to the Strategic Air Command will begin shortly thereafter.

July 31: RANGER vii successfully completed its historic mission of taking and relaying to earth closeup pictures of the lunar surface. The spacecraft sent back 4,316 high-quality photographs of the moon before it crashed on the surface of the moon in an area northwest of the Sea of Clouds. All six cameras aboard the spacecraft worked properly, sending back photographs of the moon that improved the resolution of lunar detail as seen from the earth by a factor of 1,000. The closest pictures were snapped 2.3 sec. before impact, at 10.7° south latitude and 20.7° longitude, 68 hrs. and 36 min. after takeoff.
At news conference on preliminary results from RANGER vii, held at jpl, principal experimenter Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper of Univ. of Ariz. Lunar and Planetary Laboratory described sampling of the lunar photographs as they were shown to the public. In reply to a question, he said: “.. . the thing that struck me most was that the Moon, the region of the Moon, the dimensions which we have been able to observe ... this range, tremendous range of new knowledge has not resulted in any totally unforeseen problems_____
“The Moon has shown—the records show a continuity of features from the large craters observable with telescopes down to smaller sizes.
“Think that the rounded features of the large numbers of secondary craters is new. Also their large number is new. . . .
“It is also clear that primary craters exist, little pits which have very much the same shape. . . . They are smaller, but the shape, the form, is the same as the bigger craters. . . .
“There are some ridges shown. These ridges in the maria are rather of the same nature, of the same shape, sort or form, as the larger ridges.
“So I would say, in summing up, that the new region of knowledge is in a true sense an extension of the earlier knowledge. I think it shows that the craters continue to occur down to sizes of about three feet in diameter, about one foot depth.
“This clearly implies that we are not dealing here with enormous layers of dust, of very, loose dust, that is, very loose material, where one would not expect any small features to be visible at all. It is not like sand, in other words.. , .
“This is a great day for science, and this is a great day for the United States. . . . the amount of information that has been gained about the lunar surface is truly remarkable.” (nasa Transcripts)

The pictures obtained of the lunar surface should prove extremely useful. ... They will be a guide in constructing the lunar excursion module and in planning the trip. Now we shall be able to better map out our descent route. We’ll be able to build our lunar landing equipment with greater certainty and knowledge of the conditions which our astronauts will encounter on the moon.

“Our [U.S.] drive since Sputnik I has led skeptics to call the manned lunar program only a race to beat Russia. This is a fallacy. The moon is not an advantageous spot from which to shoot nuclear-tipped missiles. We already have rockets that can hit the Soviet Union’s interior in 20 minutes. Polaris missiles can hit Russia in one or two minutes, maybe less. It would take two and a half to lliree days for a moon-based rocket to reach Russia.
“But llie Soviet Union’s design to rule llie world makes it essential that we reach the moon. This goal isn’t, as skeptics argue, just a couple of weeks of good publicity. Sure, we have a signed United Nations agreement forbidding any nation from claiming the moon or space as
a colony. But Russian domination of the moon would equate, in world opinion, with the dominance of all space. We can’t afford that false impression. The nation that retains space superiority holds an immeasurable psychological advantage. Space feats are an index of a country’s strength. If Russians were the only earthmen on the moon, you’d hear people around the world saying, ‘If they can do that, no telling what they can do to us.’ ” (Pageant, 7/64)

Shoemaker) had tentatively concluded that “because there exists such sharp little craters here on the surface, this indicates that there is not a deep layer of dust in this area. There would be expected to be a layer of dust on the lunar surface . . . there has been much speculation about how deep it would be. . . . Some people had speculated as much as a thousand feet. Many as much as 30 or 40 feet. Others had said no, it can’t be. And those who said no, it can’t be, Dr. Shoemaker now thinks were right. At least as far as this area is concerned.”
Asked by the President whether the ranger vii success confirmed “that you folks had known what you were doing,” Dr. Pickering replied: “Yes, I think it does.
“First of all, it confirms we know what we are doing technically when we design something to do this job. Secondly, that as far as the Apollo Program is concerned, it confirms that the basic assumptions that they were making about the sort of surface we are going to have to land on is probably correct.”
The President asked, “What similar achievements, scientific achievements, can be compared to this?” and Dr. Newell replied: “Dr. Kuiper was asked this question yesterday. He stated he felt this was comparable to the photographing of the sun in the ultraviolet light by the Naval Research Laboratory a number of years ago.
“Someone else said that this amounts to a big jump in lunar science, equivalent to the jump that occurred when Galileo turned the telescope on the heavens.”
President Johnson said: “If we were to conclude—if I were to conclude, if the Budget were to conclude, or if the American people should conclude—that we want to effect a savings here of a few billion dollars, would it he your opinion, Doctor [Pickering], that we would be pennywise and pound-foolish?”
Dr. Pickering replied: “It would indeed, sir, because I believe that this is truly an investment not only which is needed to demonstrate our leadership in the relatively near future, but it is a long-term investment for the future. ” (NASA Transcript)
• Concluding his White House briefing by scientists on ranger vn, President Johnson stated:
“I want to say that all Americans are very proud of you today. We are proud of this historic extension of man’s knowledge. We are proud
of our scientists, our engineers and all the great team under the leadership of one of the greatest of all Americans, Jim Webb, who are responsible for this success. We can be duly proud of our free and open society, our system of government.
“We started behind in space. We were making many apologies just a few years ago. We had our failures, but we kept our faith in the ways of freedom, and we did not follow the easy or the inexpensive course. We know this morning that the United States has achieved fully the leadership we have sought for free men. . . .
“I think we can say this morning that this is a victory for peaceful civilian international cooperation in this hour of frustration, when so many people are getting upset at some minor disappointments.
“I think we can all take great pride in this development. More than 60 countries all around the world work for us and work for peaceful progress and work for peaceful uses of outer space....
“These men don’t wear a dsm this morning, and we are not presenting them any Congressional Medal of Honor. But they do have, and all of their associates from Mr. Webb down to the fellow who sweeps out the dust in the remote test laboratory, the gratitude and the admiration of all Americans of all faiths, of all parties, of all regions.
“You are welcome to the White House. The people who live here are mighty proud of you.” (NASA Transcript)
August 1: In article on ranger vii flight, Soviet newspaper Pravda concluded: “Soviet scientists are happy to note that the launching of ‘Ranger 7’— a new national achievement of the USA in its program to investigate the moon—represents a contribution to the study of outer space.” Izvestia published photograph of the lunar surface taken by ranger vii as illustration of interview with Soviet astronomer Boris Levin, who said the ranger vii flight was “definitely an important contribution to the study of the composition of the lunar surface.” (Pravda, 8/1/64, 1, atss-t Trans.; USIA Research Results, CR, 8/11/64,18370-73)
•	In lead editorial on the RANGER vn flight, New York Times lauded the
success of the experiment but expressed the opinion that the flight once more emphasized the possibilities for international cooperation in such efforts: “. . . Proud as this country has reason to be of Ranger 7’s accomplishment, we can only conjecture how much more rapidly and cheaply its photographs could have been obtained had Soviet and American scientists been able to pool their efforts and resources years ago, rather than being required to pursue their efforts in competitive— and costly—isolation. The ease for a unified international effort to reach the Moon—as urged by Presidents Kennedy and Johnson—is strengthened by every consideration of the needless waste and duplication that have marked humanity’s space exploration to date.” (NYT, 8/1/64,20)
•	Washington Daily News editorialized that the success of ranger vii’s mis-
sion represented “a significant milestone on a historic road to manned exploration of the moon.” The lunar flight was termed “a demonstration of man’s ceaseless, boundless quest for knowledge—and one which, in the end, is likely to pay off as well as similar past vovages into the unknown.” (Wash.

given the Russians (as well as the moon) one in the eye. Yet surely the thing itself is the thing itself, and is wonderful in the full sense of that word. To see actual photographs close-up of the surface of the moon, whose mystery throughout the history of mankind has but been enhanced by its proximity and by the fact that something could always be seen there, is a matter of awe and wonder; and that is the main thing about this moonshot.” (Balt.

Also in the House, Rep. Louis C. Wyman (R.-N.H.) said the transmission of lunar photographs was “a great tribute to the scientific progress of our experts in America’s space program,” and RANGER VII was “a highly technical success ... in the right direction; namely, the use of machines” rather than man in space exploration. He added that Project Apollo need not be called off, but he felt Congress should “hold back on the appropriations for Apollo space vehicle procurement until we have established that man can rendezvous in space by completing successfully the present Gemini program. . . .” He also advocated elimination of a target date for U.S. manned landing on the moon.

•	Results of decompression experiments with mice in atmospheres of
helium-oxygen, nitrogen-oxygen, and argon-oxygen were reported in Missiles and Rockets. Performed by group at Purdue Research Facility, experiments showed mice survived decompression markedly longer in helium-oxygen atmosphere than in air. In one experiment, eight mice decompressed in helium-oxygen atmosphere survived an average of 6.1min. longer than six mice decompressed in air. Extrapolation of these results might indicate desirability of helium-oxygen atmospheres in spacecraft for prolonged manned flights; the extra minutes of survival would provide safety margin, in case of accidental decompression, for crew to take necessary emergency measures.

•	Discussing President Johnson’s July 24 announcement of the SR-71
mach 3 aircraft under development for SAC, Robert Hotz editorialized in Aviation Week: “. . . The ‘SR—71’ was, of course, the A-ll [YF-12A] with still another designation pasted on its titanium skin. But many congressmen were fooled, and unthinking daily newspapermen and wire service reporters failed to catch the deception and spread the news across the nation of the ‘new’ billion-dollar aircraft program.
“The inception of this program also was conveniently shifted from 1959 in the Eisenhower Administration to 1963 in the Kennedy Administration. Anybody familiar with aircraft development cycles knows that if this program were really started in 1963, it would be impossible to deliver operational aircraft to Strategic Air Command in 1965, as President Johnson stated. . . .” (Av.

August 5: ranger vii briefing to members of Congress, with Harris (“Bud”) Schurmeier, Ranger Project Manager, JPL, and Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, Director of Lunar and Planetary Div., Univ. of Arizona, as principal speakers. Dr. Kuiper said: “I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that a new era has begun in the exploration of the Moon.. . .
“Here, in one step last week a gain of a factor of 2,000 was made—
2,000	in the effective magnification of the image of the lunar surface [earlier reported as 1,000].. . .”
Discussing preliminary results of the lunar photographs, Dr. Kuiper said: “. . . down to the size of approximately two or three feet, the primary craters caused by direct impacts on the moon covered ... an area amounting to about one percent of the lunar surface. So this is a very great help in landing operations, either by unmanned soft landings, such as Surveyor, or manned landings as planned for Apollo.
“. . . the innocent-looking ray systems, such as one has around Copernicus, Tycho, Kepler, a number of craters really are danger spots. When you look at them closely, . . . one sees them resolved into multitudes, clusters of secondary craters. ... I wouldn’t be surprised if slopes of the order of 15 degrees would be found. This would be somewhat difficult. This is a rather uncomfortable inclination on which to land.
“. . . the surface between these craters is, smoother than I had thought. ... I have . . , many times hypothesized that if you would go to higher and higher magnification, higher and higher resolution, that
there would be a large number of cracks on the moon, fissures similar to those one finds on lava fields such as on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, or recent lava fields which have not yet been eroded.
“This apparently is not the case. This was wrong . . . these cracks are not present. It looks as if the surface of the moon has been buffeted, has been simply pounded on, and has been sort of smoothed out, and the cracks filled in the process.. . .
“Now the question is, what about the surface? What is the nature of the surface. ... It is not just a loose pile of sand, dust. It has considerable stiffness. And . . . while we know from other data that the top structure is open, it is sort of like snow or a biscuit, a cracker. It has an open structure; nevertheless, it looks as if the moon may have considerable bearing strength. That, however, is something which must be measured separately, with separate equipment.
“However, we can say that there are not enormous depths, several feet, ten, or a hundred feet of dust, which would simply not have permitted formation of the sharp little craters as we observe them.” (NASA Transcript)

All week long the Americans have been doing what Americans do best—working together.
“The results have been highly gratifying. The week has been deeply reassuring. Wherever we have faced them, we have been meeting our challenges—at the Gulf of Tonkin, the halls of Congress, in distant space of our universe and all sections of our Nation.
“Only a week ago, we saw a steady, stable, straight-forward national course yield an important national success in the mission of Ranger 7. . . .”

•	Addressing Aerospace Industries Association Council in Seattle, Dr.
Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, summarized future aerospace trends. He foresaw no immediate substantial decrease in dollar amount of defense spending,
but said industry should be able to shift emphasis from production of weapon systems to “other useful types and forms of economic activity”— which he said should be toward an expanding space program and an increase in r&d of advanced weapons technology. Of space program values he said:
“The space program has been a catalyst, a stimulus to education at all levels, with particular attention to science and engineering. How much is it worth to have raised the educational sights of our young people and at the same time to have increased significantly the wealth of knowledge with which to condition them? I cannot put a price on it, but I believe its value will exceed the total cost of the space program.
“The contribution of our space program to our national security is also considerable. How much more secure are we, due to improved communications, more accurate navigation, more complete weather information, and better world-wide mapping? How much is it worth to be better informed about potential sources of danger? How can we assess the advantage of developing competence to detect and offset possible aggression from space? I cannot put a price on these contributions to national security, but I am confident that their value also exceeds the total cost of the space program.
“The space program stimulates the development of new products, new productive processes, and new managerial techniques. I cannot place a precise value upon such innovations, but I would estimate that such investment will repay itself many times over.
“A substantial difference in influence in world affairs evolves from whether a country is in a first position or a second position in power. To a significant degree, a nation’s relative position depends on how it stands in advanced technology. . . .
“Combining, as the space program does, the best talents in management, in engineering, and in science, with the most modem facilities available, the net result is the production of progress. A program which stimulates education, expands research and development, augments total productivity, increases employment, and improves our international relations, is a program of the greatest economic significance. . . .” (Text)

August 10: Ernest W. Brackett, NASA Assistant Deputy Associate Administrator (Procurement Policy), addressed National Association of Professional Contract Administrators in Orlando, Fla. Discussing some NASA contract matters of current interest, he outlined ways in which NASA worked similarly to and differently than dod contract administration, then said:
“Perhaps the outstanding difference between NASA and dod in the field? of- contract administration is in the area of quality control and inspection, nasa’s contracts are almost wholly for research and the development of satellites, space vehicles, engines, etc., the like of which have never been made before. There are no production type contracts and these probably will be very few. The system of inspection and quality control as envisaged by NASA is quite different from the sampling type of inspection used on a production line.
“We buy only a few of each item and a failure may mean the compromise of a program. Also, development items are very expensive and the loss of a shot may mean the loss of millions of dollars. There have been failures where the cause has been traced to the failure of a small component costing a hundred dollars or so which might have been caught with proper inspection. The Saturn is an example of a project where very high degrees of quality control have been applied and very detailed inspection has taken place. The six Saturn shots have all been successful and it is difficult to criticize success.
“nasa has had over 100 space shots. There have been successes and failures. In 1960 only 47% of the shots were successful,t but in 1963 successes had risen to 85%. You can expect continued emphasis on quality control from NASA. Someone described that degree of reliability that nasa is looking for as being the equivalent of 1,000 TV sets made to run continuously for a year without a single one failing. . . .” (Text)

Among the nasa officials participating in the presentation were Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, Langley Research Center Director Dr. Floyd Thompson, and Goddard Space Flight Center Director Dr. Harry Goett.
Carl T. Rowan, Director of U.S. Information Agency, said in address at the ceremony:
“As we view the unfolding drama of the American space program it can be clearly seen that one of its most significant aspects is that it has been carried out in the full, open view of an interested and anxious world. When it was written into the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 that the activities of the new space agency were to be open to the widest practicable and appropriate spread of information, the Congress cast into law one of the deepest instincts of the American people. It was an act of faith to specify that this enterprise should be carried on openly before the gaze of those who wished us well and those who hoped otherwise; it was truly an expression of faith in freedom and the ability of Americans to meet the challenges and opportunities of an era when each day unfolds new perils and new promises.
“If openness to public scrutiny was a basic concept in the entire space program, the decision to carry out a satellite program dedicated to freedom of communications on a global scale represented that concept converted into a highly meaningful fact. . . .
“It is obvious that the over-riding quality of communications satellites is their internationalism. A practical system based on communication satellites is inherently universal, for it would be of little use if it did not mean communicating between the peoples of widely separated lands. Its basic premise involves the inclusion of as many countries as possible in the interchange that the system allows.
“This presentation of communication satellites to our national museum of science and technology is, therefore, most truly an international occasion. For it is their international utility in the cause of world understanding, peace and progress which gives them their deepest meaning.” (Text)

•	Rep. Peter W. Rodino (D.—N.J.) said on House floor: “. . . Hardly any
problem seems beyond solution by our scientists and engineers. We marvel at our achievement of landing a vehicle on the moon, transmitting pictures of its progress to the very instant of impact. Yet, we are doing practically nothing to solve a major air safety problem, or, worse yet, to discover its cause. I refer to the increasingly serious jet age problem of clear air turbulence—CAT—a danger to every passenger flying commercial or military transport aircraft. . . .
“Our scientific and industrial communities must be given adequate funds promptly to initiate work on the problem; and that can best be done through a coordinated research effort jointly undertaken by Government and private industry. . . .
“Our failure to implement without delay a national effort to develop an effective cat detection and avoidance system may—in fact, probably will—cost the lives of many future air passengers. With every gain in air traffic, with every increase in aircraft speed, with every additional mile flown by every additional plane, the problem becomes more serious. . . .” He introduced into the Record an article on CAT by James A. Fusca in Space Aeronautics, August 1964. (CR, 8/19/64,19715-20)

•	Speaking on the floor of the House, Rep. George P. Miller (D.-Calif.)
pointed out:
“In our preoccupation with our national space program, we often overlook the fact that aeronautical research and development is a very important and productive part of the whole NASA program. . . .
“I should point out that the technology that has evolved from the X-15 program has made possible the creation of the A-ll and the RS-71, hypersonic aircraft in the 2,000-mile-an-hour range, which offer great potential to our Air Force as versatile, high-flying reconnaissance vehicles. NASA, with the X-15, is contributing significantly to the supersonic transport program through new materials, construction techniques, guidance and control systems, and aerodynamic designs that are available now because the naca had the foresight and determination to undertake the X—15 program in 1954, in association with the Air Force and the Navy.
“In 1959, the first flight was made. Since then, the X—15 pilots have rocketed out into near space, where 99 percent of the earth’s atmosphere is below them, have reached speeds 6 times the speed of sound that have made the plane glow red hot.
“Now, an advanced X—15 is ready to reach for new heights and even greater speeds. Our investment in the X-15 program and our confidence in the men and pilots who have made it so successful, have paid off handsomely for the individual taxpayer and for the country. Our world leadership and prestige in aeronautics have been enhanced mani-
fold by the X-15. It has played an indispensable role in making sure that America’s place in the search for new knowledge of flight will never be less than it is now.” (CR, 8/20/64,20046)
August 20: Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, spoke at Conference on the Role of Simulation in Space Technology, at VPI:
“The history of applied science and engineering is really a history of simulation—a history of searching for methods of observing apriori the behavior of engineering systems and of varying the parameters of such systems in order to seek optimum results. . . .
“Our ability to develop the engineering systems of atmospheric and space flight depends in turn upon our ability to simulate in the laboratory and thereby study new concepts as well as systems and their components prior to flight. In general, two kinds of simulation facilities are required. Those which are used to develop new concepts and physical understanding . . . [and] the larger simulation facilities needed for the ad-hoc testing and development of subsystems and systems in preparation for flight. In addition to facilities, however, there is needed a certain level of knowledge of the arts and sciences of simulation. . . .” (Text) .

“Today, because of vigorous United States space effort, the early Soviet leadership has been largely overcome. We now must demonstrate our determination to drive ahead toward unchallenged and enduring pre-eminence in space. . . .
“To be secure in the world today a great nation must maintain a posture of strength. . . .
“Space research and national security are also intertwined because of the potential uses to which the fruits of our research can be put. Because the consequences of nuclear war are potentially so disastrous for the human race, economic competition has assumed increasing importance as a measure of the strength of competing ideologies. Moreover, scientific and technical research and development have become the hasic elements in this competition. . . .
“. . . for nations which are today still floundering amidst conditions less tolerable than those of Colonial America, great hope for more rapid progress lies in the new ideas, techniques and methods which are arising from our research and development in space.
“If we can employ the scientific knowledge and technical ideas developed in our space program to help the impoverished nations help themselves, and thus reduce their requirement for direct financial aid, how much better for them and for ourselves.
“Our greatest hope for national security, of course, lies in achieving in the world a degree of international amity which can lead to enduring peace. Here, again, the exploration of space offers great promise, for in the acceptance of this greatest of all challenges, man can join in shooting rockets into space, instead of shooting them at each other.
“Our national leaders have recognized that if we are to arrive at an understanding with the Soviet Union which will permit the exploration of space to become a mutual project, for the benefit of all mankind, we must maintain a driving national effort in space to insure a technological balance that will make this possible. . . .” (Text)

August 24-28: International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences held its fourth Congress in Paris. At the Congress, Harold B. Finger, Manager of aec—NASA Space Nuclear Propulsion Office and Director of NASA Nuclear Systems and Space Power, made presentation on nuclear space propulsion systems:
“. . . Space propulsion using nuclear energy offers a capability for accomplishment of high energy increment, high payload missions in space beyond the capability of the chemical combustion propulsion systems when considering practical operating limitations. Work now underway in the United States indicates that nuclear rockets can be anticipated for earliest use in the space program. Reactor tests being conducted during this year should provide a firm technical basis for system development. Electric propulsion using the nuclear reactor energy source offers promising storable propellant performance if light-weight, long-life power supplies can Be developed. Technology investigations are now underway to evaluate the feasibility of achieving the required performance. This work will simultaneously provide the information that is required to provide large amounts of electric power for non-propulsive purposes in space. Beyond these systems, a host of new and advanced concepts have been proposed. These are not well enough defined or evaluated to assure that their high performance potential can actually be achieved. Some research work is underway on these systems.” (Text)

“The whole complex activity of exploring space is important not only because the many private and governmental organizations con* tributing to space flight are continually uncovering new facts, new products, and new processes which bring immediate benefits to man kind. These benefits are only the beginning. Looking beyond them, we see vast unknown frontiers opening up, with unguessable discoveries yet to be made. Step by step we are conquering the hostile environment of space. We are accumulating new knowledge about the heavenly bodies, and disproving old beliefs about them.

Kuiper expressed opinion that the crater rays were lava flows. Dr. Kuiper stated the impact area was not typical of the lunar surface. Of the RANGER vn lunar photographs, Dr. Kuiper revealed that the photographs resolved objects down to 10—15 inches, and the resolution was considered
1,000	times better than the very best earth-based observation and 5,000 times better than routine earth-based observation. 200 more of the lunar photographs were released.
On the question of the nature of the lunar surface, no firm conclusion was drawn. Dr. Kuiper, who estimated erosion on the moon to be about 5 ft., said it was “purely a guess” that there was “fairly solid stuff there.” He added that it was not possible to obtain such data as surface bearing strength from the ranger vii photographs. Dr. Harold Urey, whose paper was read in his absence, also expressed his belief that the photographs did not answer the question of surface strength; however, he said that a “spongy,” “fairy castle structure” could be prevalent many feet down. Dr. Shoemaker, who expressed view that moon loses more material than it gains, suggested erosion could be on the order of 50 ft. He said U.S. Geological Survey was converting the photographic data into topographic profiles, and the results were showing that moon’s surface was “smoother than I had dared hope.” He said average slope in the area being studied did not exceed 10° and pointed out that this was reassuring for Project Apollo, whose Lem spacecraft had been designed to land safely on slope of 15°.

Today we have allocated almost half the resources needed to carry out the greatest adventure in the history of mankind—the manned lunar landing which is the goal of the Apollo Program. This goal could not have been conceived, much less achieved, without the amazing growth of knowledge, techniques, and technology in the field of electronics which has been ever accelerating since the last war. Communications, guidance, power, control, display, all these have passed and surpassed the maximum expectations of a decade ago.
“In the Apollo Program we are developing a set of capabilities which will provide for manned exploration, understanding man’s proficiency in space and the vicinity of the earth. This is a capability which can be extended to meet the needs of this Nation for science or technology, for transportation or observation, for defense or commerce.
“Although the end is manned exploration of space, the means, including the production of space vehicles, is being created here on earth.

“Although lliese adjustments will affect launch schedules and program milestones, Dr. Dryden, Dr. Seamans, and I are convinced that it is
best to make a maximum effort to gain operational leadership in manned space flight and that the manned lunar landing should continue to be targeted within this decade. This will stretch NASA and its contractors to the limit, but we have advised the President that we are not at this time willing to give up this goal which is so challenging, and which is so important as a focus for the efforts we must continue to make in all our programs. . . .
“The target date is only five years away. Our assurance that it can be met is less than under President Johnson’s budget, but we still hope that with hard work, dedication, continued successes, and continued support we can meet it. We are going to make a hard try.
“This decision does not involve the transfer to manned flight of funds from space science and applications programs or advanced research and technology programs. These programs will require some adjustments, but will not be drastically reduced as would be necessary if funds were reprogrammed to benefit manned space flight.
“In the program for unmanned planetary exploration, the combination of a heavy workload at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the short lead time available, and the importance of applying our resources to a major advance beyond the limited Mariner make it unwise to undertake a Mars mission in 1966 with the current Mariner-type spacecraft. The development of a spacecraft with much greater scientific promise for launch to Mars in 1969 is being initiated. . . .” (NASA Release 64-221)

“For some years past, it has been asked whellier electric propulsion meets a ‘requirement’ in our space program. It may be well to remember that the airplane, the atomic submarine, llie radio, and the first satellite were not developed in fulfillment of ‘requirements.’ An artificial atmosphere is certainly a requirement for an astronaut in space, and must be developed for that reason. But the astronaut does not go into space because it is his requirement, but because our country has decided to excel in llie exploration of outer space with llie most appropriate means. Electric propulsion promises to be a very appropriate melliod of vastly expanding our exploration capability in space beyond lliat of chemical and nuclear systems. For that reason, its development should be pursued willi high priority and great vigor.” (A&A, 8/64, 14—15)

“First and foremost, llie Saturn-I testing program has already made possible an additional payload capability of approximately 4300 lb. without major redesign efforts. A substantial portion of lliis gain has come from altered operational and procedural techniques developed during llie normal course of static and flight testing. The impact of major redesigns will not be felt, as a result of the lead times involved, until llie first of llie Satum-IB vehicles. . . .”	(A&A, 8/64,/ 20-25)
During August: J. S. Butz, Jr., said in Air Force and Space Digest article on the future of aviation:
“Aeronautics in the 1970s and 1980s promises to eclipse anything of the past in both scope and the performance of individual aircraft. Although missile and space systems will continue to furnish strong competition for national support, aviation activity in the decades ahead will be much more extensive and important than it is today. . . .
“The revolutionary effect of the new technology on future aircraft can be best illustrated by discussing two key areas. One is propulsion. The other is materials. Light, more powerful engines, and lighter, stronger structures always have been key design objectives. This is still true. . . .”
He quoted Dr. Alexander H, Flax, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development: “‘It is possible today to begin the development of lightweight gas-turbine engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of better than 10 to I.’ Dr. Flax points out that installed thrust-to-weight ratios apparently can rise to higher than 20 to 1 on the second generation of future engines.
“Ten years ago such a statement would have got him laughed out of most scientific and engineering meetings. A few people may still argue that the estimate is high. But the main argument now is over how best to achieve this truly stunning performance rather than over the possibility of achieving it.” He detailed some of the r&d areas with great potential for future aircraft, then said:
“Technical evidence abounds to prove that an aeronautical revolution is at hand and that the first step in that revolution can have great economic importance. It clearly is time for more resolute action. Britain and France, and possibly the Soviet Union, have approximately the same opportunity as the US to capitalize on what is known now. In western Europe, at least, engine and materials technology is well advanced. . . .” (AF Mag., 8/64)

September 4: nasa’s ogo i (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory) was launched from Cape Kennedy by Atlas-Agena B rocket booster into highly elliptical orbit (92.721-mi. apogee, 175-mi. perigee, 621%-hr. period, and 31° inclination to the equator). The huge 1,073-lb. satellite carried 20 experiments, inaugurating new “space bus” series of standardized observatories capable of conducting many related space experiments simultaneously in space. However, one of ogoi’s long booms, one short boom including the omnidirectional radio antenna did not deploy. This resulted in abnormal operation of the automatic control system, and most of the control gas was used in attempting to lock the satellite into its earth-stabilized orbit. Project officials attributed the satellite’s inability to lock onto the earth to the fact that its earth-seeking sensor was obscured by one of the undeployed booms. Scientists decided not to attempt turning on experiments for several days while calculating contingency operations for a spin-stabilized satellite.

Erosion of the moon’s surface at rate of one micron (1/25,000 in.) per year would be enough, “over geological time,” to smooth out a once-rocky surface. This erosion, caused by cosmic dust and energetic solar particles, would have deposited dust in low areas and gradually filled them. However, Dr. Gold said that even if in the craters and seas the dust were a mile deep, it was no cause for concern; dust on the moon, like that on earth, would not necessarily be loose and powdery at depths below the surface.

•	Lunar photographs made by ranger vii and interpretations of their find-
ings were discussed in Saturday Review by Science Editor John Lear:
“The net sum of the evidence here recited is that the Congress and the people have been misled about the true significance of the Ranger VII mission. The pictures sent back home by the ingeniously constructed robot dragonfly contain no more assurance of the safety of a manned landing on the moon than existed before Ranger VII took off. On the contrary, one sure danger has been discovered that had not been suspected before. The apparent disappearance of the supposed danger of impenetrable dust is accompanied by the equal danger of a landing surface that may be as fragile as a tea biscuit. Ranger VII couldn’t possibly have seen what matters most of all when human expeditions of the moon are being weighed: the bearing strength of the lunar face. Given man’s present limited knowledge of soil physics, no photograph could tell whether the moon’s surface will hold a spaceboat or even a lone man. . . .” (SR, 9/5/64, 35-43)
•	USAF’s start (Spacecraft Technology and Advanced Re-entry Test) pro-

START involves a dozen or more areas of investigation in the general field of re-entry. It could lead to development of a manned re-entry vehicle for use with the Manned Orbital Laboratory, one which could make a maneuvering re-entry to a landing field, as opposed to the ballistic flight path of the Gemini spacecraft which will be the original MOL re-entry vehicle. Looking farther down the road, start technology could provide the basis for eventual development of a large ferry vehicle for shuttling men and supplies to and from an orbiting space station. . . .”
First contract for this new type of spacecraft was awarded recently to Martin Marietta Corp. for ablative-type re-entry body, designated SV-5, capable of maneuvering during re-entry into earth’s atmosphere at hypersonic-transonic speeds.

•	Soviet scientist Prof. A. G. Kuznetsov told iaf that U.S.S.R.
had conducted tests of cosmonauts spending 25 days in sealed chamber with helium-oxygen atmosphere. He said in one test, although there were no adverse effects on the subject, slight changes were noted— quickened pulse and respiration rate, faster blood circulation, and higher voice pitch to 7/10th of an octave. Prof. Kuznetsov noted that the manned Vostok spacecraft used mixture of nitrogen and oxygen; he did not disclose whether that mixture affected cosmonauts adversely, but he said that “helium offers a possible substitute for nitrogen that might prove more suitable for spacecraft requirements.” Helium might reduce toxicity and provide a more hygienic atmosphere, he said.
Dr. Eugene B. Konecci of NASA, cochairman of the bioastronautics session, said U.S. had not pressed development of helium system for three principal reasons: (1) helium’s tendency to alter voice pitch; (2) helium’s leak qualities, which make it difficult to contain in enclosure; and (3) helium’s high thermal conductivity, which might pose possible astronaut heating problem. “We still feel strongly about nitrogen. We presently see no advantage to helium that would cause us to change. However, we will continue to study the possibility of using it in case we encounter some unforeseen nitrogen difficulty,” Dr. Konecci said. [Wash. Post, 9/9/64; AP, Balt. Sun, 9/9/64)

“We now have developed and tested two systems with the ability to intercept and destroy armed satellites circling the earth in space. I can tell you today that these systems are in place, they Eire operationally ready, and they are on alert to protect this Nation and the free world.
“Our only purpose still is peace. But should another nation employ such weapons in space, the United States will be prepared and ready to reply. . . .”
The President also disclosed U.S. h£id produced “over-the-horizon” radar, which would “literally look around the curve of the earth . . . [and] give us earlier warning than ever before of any hostile launches against this country.” (Text)
•	In its first five years of powered flight, the X-15 aircraft amassed total of 17
hrs., 52 min., 7.1 sec. of flight, of which 4 hrs., 8 min., 16.8 sec. was powered flight. The rocket-powered research aircraft accrued 4 hrs., 13 min., 11 sec. of flight at speeds Eibove 2,000 mph (mach 3), far more flight time at mach 3 than any other aircraft. It Etchieved a total of 2 hrs., 39 min., 47.4 sec. at macn 4 (about 2,700 mph), a speed impossible for any other manned aircraft; 40 min., 45.1 sec. above mach 5 (about 3,400 mph); and 11.6 sec. above mach 6 (about 4,000 mph). The
X-15 was built for top speed of 4,000 mph and altitude capability of
250,000	ft. Piloted by Joseph A. Walker (nasa), the X—15 set unofficial world speed record at 4,104 mph and unofficial world altitude record of 354,200 ft. It held current official FAI world altitude record of 314,750 ft., set July 17, 1962, with Maj. Robert M. Rushworth (usaf) as pilot. The No. 2 aircraft, mollified to provide longer engine burn time, was expected to attain much higher speeds—possibly as high as mach 8 (more than 5,000 mph). In its first five years the X-15 made 116 flights. It was expected that the three aircraft would bring the total to twice that many within about five more years, (nasa Release 64-265)

September 18: Saturn I SA-7 two-stage rocket was launched from Cape Kennedy, placing in orbit a nearly-37,000-lb. payload consisting of boilerplate Apollo spacecraft command and service modules, instrument unit, and spent S-IV stage. The orbit (145-mi. apogee, 112-mi. perigee,
88.6-min. period) was similar to the interim orbit for future lliree-man Apollo lunar missions. All major test objectives were met: final development testing of Saturn I propulsion, structural, guidance and flight control systems; development testing of Apollo spacecraft structure and design during flight through the atmosphere; and demonstration of physical compatibility of launch vehicle and spacecraft and test-jettisoning of spacecraft launch escape system. Except for minor changes in Saturn I vehicle, test was similar to Saturn I SA-6 (May 28, 1964). For third time, elaborate system of eight motion picture cameras and one TV camera was mounted in S-I stage to record such flight events as S-IV stage separation and ignition of S-IV engines. The eight motion picture cameras were ejected following S-I powered flight, but Hurricane Gladys was located about 300-mi. from camera impact point, so the recovery ship had to leave llie area llie previous day and recovery was not attempted, (nasa Release 64-228; upi, NYT, 9/19/64, 11; Marshall Star, 9/23/64,1; msc Roundup, 9/30/64,1)

Progress of a substantial nature is being made in strengthening our national security through space competence”; crash program—“Crash programs have unlimited funds, unlimited overtime, and parallel approaches to the end objective. None of these aspects applies to the space program or even to the lunar project . . .”; either /or philosophy—“Actually investments stimulate other investments; they do not deter them. . . . What is more, decreased spending in education, for example, does not automatically increase the funds available for space exploration, or vice versa . . .”; and slowdown—“such an approach would be of great benefit to the Soviets as it would make it easier for them to increase their lead in some aspects of space and attain the lead in others. Do not think for a moment that they are not trying hard to do just lliat. So far lliis year, the USSR has put more than twice as many spacecraft into orbit as they had put into orbit by this time last year. In a sense, they are doubling their space effort. . . . To slow down a carefully planned project, such as Apollo, would be to increase its cost and reduce its likelihood of timely success. ... Those who propose the stretchout or slowdown in the space program are in fact arguing for inefficiency and higher costs as well as delayed accomplishments.” (Text)

September 21: NASA Administrator James E. Webb said in Aviation IFeek & Space Technology that U.S. space program had “entered a whole new period,” in which U.S. was faced with exploring all the practical applications of knowledge suddenly gained through the space effort. “My view is to create stability, and the satellite may be one of the most important tools yet developed to create stability ift the world. ... In this effort, modern technology is going to play a very important role. The balance of technological power may be more important than any other form of power balance in the next decades ahead.” He said NASA was developing a broad technological capability to conduct missions with vast international application. “This will enable our nation to say to other nations of the world, ‘Join with us and we will undertake these missions together.’ ”
“Overt expression” of this new focus of national space program planning would be expressed in forecast report NASA was completing for President Johnson, the article continued.

•	Editorial in Aviation Week by Robert Hotz:
“The hardware for the second generation of U.S. space systems is already in the flight test stage and its feasibility already demonstrated. This is why it is necessary now to organize a new type of national space program based not on the simple concept of overtaking the Soviets but on utilizing the new riches of space technology to serve domestic and international goals of U.S. policy. . . .
“A whole new spectrum of power has been created, ranging from the three tons of thrust per second of the huge liquid-fueled boosters through electric, nuclear and ionic power down to systems whose power can be calibrated in micromouse burps and can function for years without servicing. Harnessing these new energy sources for earth as well as space applications may be one of the most technically significant developments of the next decade.
“nasa is picking an excellent time, aside from the election implications, to inventory the achievements of space technology and project them into a future format that will give the national space program a focus and purpose beyond the Apollo lunar landings. For the development of space technology will continue to open new vistas for man and his universe that cannot yet be perceived from this point in time with our vision still clouded by the earth’s atmospheric sheath.” (Av.

“We have observed repeatedly how a given technology has been advanced by the military requirements and how this technology is later borrowed for consumer products. However, these underlying technologies may be catalyzed with equal effectiveness by significant peacetime objectives set by the President, as exemplified by the Nation’s space program.
“Therefore, the nation must support activities during peacetime which have as their purpose large-scale technological goals separated from commercial and military needs. The application of nuclear energy to space exploitation offers such a goal—one which can provide enormous subsidiary benefits in addition to opening the gateway to deep space.” (GE Forum, 7/9/64,15-17)

October 4: NASA explorer xxi scientific earth satellite (imp b) was launched into orbit from Cape Kennedy with a Thor-Delta rocket booster. Onboard instrumentation was working excellently, but the satellite’s orbit (59,400-mi. apogee; 120-mi. perigee; 34-hr., 57-min. period; 33°53' inclination to the equator) fell far short of the intended deep-space path which would have enabled the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform to measure magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and solar winds in interplanetary space. Planned apogee was 161,000 mi. Robert H. Gray, Director of Goddard Launch Operations, said minimum apogee required for mission success was about 97,750 mi. As in launch of explorer xviii (imf a), the Delta rocket used higher-thrust third-stage motor, the X—258, to give the satellite its final boost into orbital injection. Preliminary tracking data indicated this stage had not provided the required thrust. Designed and built by nasa Goddard Space Flight Center, explorer xxi contained nine experiments.

in address at centennial convocation luncheon, Worcester Polytechnic Institute:	*
“The new era promised by the Space Age perhaps connotes a return to what was once called natural philosophy. The unifying element of
these developments of the space program is a general spirit of inquiry into the nature of the external physical world. It represents a re-direction of interest away from the increasingly narrow specialization which has characterized the physical sciences in the last decades.
“The second distinguishing feature of the scientific research in space is the fact that the various scientists have only been able to make their observations ... by virtue of the hardware developed by the engineer. This is in distinct contrast to the biologist who could invest in a good microscope and do research comparable with the best. . . . Generally, the engineer exploits and puts to practical use the knowledge acquired by the scientists. But in space, the scientist seems to be particularly dependent on the engineer to develop new devices and techniques. Engineering, in this context, has become a more creative and trail-blazing profession.
“The third and possibly most imposing challenge of the space age is the potential feed-back of its developments into the civilian economy. In the long run, the justification of our space budget must stand on this ‘fall-out.’ . . .” (Text)

•	NASA launched second re-entry experiment for aec, designated Reentry
Flight Demonstration-2 (RFD-2), on a Scout booster from Wallops Island, Va. Nonradioactive mockup of nuclear isotopic generator was sent to 800-mi. altitude by three-stage Scout, before the payload reentered atmosphere on its ballistic trajectory and impacted about 250 mi. southeast of Bermuda. Primary objective of rfd-2 was to acquire data on generator disassembly and fuel capsule burnup rate for use in advanced generator designs. In previous flight test (rfd-1 in May 1963), nonradioactive model of Snap-lOA nuclear reactor was tested in atmospheric re-entry; rfd-i demonstrated that space reactors can be designed to melt down and disassemble upon re-entry. The nonradioactive mockup in rfd-2 was a model of an isotopic-thermoelectric generator. Earlier testing had shown that heat created during re-entry could be used to burn up isotopic generator, leaving very minute particles which then would be dispersed at high altitudes to eliminate any radiation danger.

October 13: U.S.S.R. announced three-man voskhod I spacecraft had landed safely after orbiting the earth for 24 hrs., 17 min. (16 orbits). All three crewmen were reported to. be in good condition after voskhod i landed at the “pre-arranged spot.” Indications were that the men remained inside the craft to completion of landing. Official announcement asserted that voskhod i had completed its task before landing and was landing according to schedule. Soviet news report indicated the crew had requested permission to continue the flight “for another 24 hours,” but Chief Designer had replied that “we shall stay within the program.” (AP, 10/13/64; Tanner, NYT, 10/14/64, 1, 18)
•	Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics
and Space Council, said U.S.S.R.’s successful orbiting of three-man voskhod I spacecraft “shows they are actively in the race with manned spacecraft.” He noted Soviet emphasis on life sciences in their space program. “They have done more in this field, I believe, than we have.” Asked about U.S. chances for landing a man on the moon before U.S.S.R., he replied: “We have a 50-50 chance of getting there first.” But, he added, U.S.S.R. might be first with a circumlunar flight. Citing buildup of Soviet space program, Dr. Welsh said ratio of their spacecraft launchings in 1964 to comparable portion of 1963 was about 3-to-1. He described voskhod i as a “logical follow-on from a very rapidly stepped-up space program.” (Sehlstedt, Balt. Sun, 10/13/64)
•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb said in interview that Soviet three-man
voskhod I was a “significant space accomplishment.
“It is a clear indication that the Russians are continuing a large space program for the achievement of national power and prestige.” He observed that Saturn V rocket, while not yet available, represented U.S. bid for space supremacy. “It is still a good bid and our policy is to proceed rapidly to the flight stage although it is still two years away.” He said Saturn V was “ a vehicle that can put 240,000 pounds in orbit as against the 10,000- to 15,000-pound class the Russians have been flying.” (Sehlstedt, Balt. Sun, 10/13/64; Houston Post, 10/13/64)
•	Speculation about why Soviet voskhod i space flight was terminated after
24 hours was proferred by experts around the world. U.S. space engineers generally indicated Soviets operated according to plan by terminating flight when they did. However, officials of other Western countries speculated voskhod i was brought down prematurely, for reasons variously given as illness among the crew, faulty radio transmitter, and improper orbit. Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D—N. Mex.), Chairman of Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, said, “We knew the shot was coming and we had information it would involve a week— that’s why they had the doctor along.” He suggested technical problems had caused premature ending of trip. Some sources pointed to Soviets’ own announcement the previous day, which referred to “conditions of
prolonged flight.” At least one press analysis, in retrospect, said voskhod i was perhaps ordered back to earth because of political events in the Soviet Union—Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was being removed from office by Presidium of the Communist Party Central Committee, an occurrence not made public until Oct. 15. (Ubell, N.Y. Her. Trib., 10/14/64; Simons, Wash. Post, 10/14/64; Time, 10/30/64, 37)
October 13: Unnamed NASA official quoted by Howard Simons in Washington Post as saying there was “increasing evidence” that U.S.S.R. was building powerful new rocket booster. However, it was not used in launching three-man voskhod i spacecraft.

•	Analyzing impact of voskhod i flight, John Finney said feeling of U.S.
Government officials was that voskhod i “probably was the prelude to a longer flight sometime soon and to the unveiling of a more powerful rocket for launchings.” In itself, voskhod i flight was considered of more psychological than technical significance. (Finney, NYT, 10/ 14/64, 18)	.....
•	Sen. Barry M. Goldwater (R.—Ariz.), Republican Presidential candidate,
said in Topeka, Kans.:
“The entry of the Soviet Union into such a commanding position in near-space [voskhod i flight] also requires an urgent and full time consideration by all concerned branches of the Federal Government and, of course, the President.
“Near space, the area in which orbital flight takes place, is the key to the military use of space. The nation that commands near space could, after developing proper weapons and maneuverable space craft, dominate the earth.
“I have pleaded for years for a realistic emphasis on research in this area. Instead, this Administration has dedicated billions of dollars and the virtual entirety of its space efforts, to a moon shot.
“The military possibilities of space have been downgraded by this Administration, as, indeed, has most research into the advanced weapon systems which we so urgently need to keep the peace in the face of Soviet advances scientifically, and Soviet threats politically.
“Again, this is a full time and a full-scale problem requiring immediate attention. We need a major redirection of our space research efforts.” (Text, SBD, 10/14/64, 236)

October 18: nasa Administrator James E. Webb said in interview with John Finney on the subject of U.S. and U.S.S.R.’s space programs:
“The significance [of voskhod I flight], it seems to me, is the clear indication that manned flight in large spacecraft is important to the Russians, and offers opportunities for them for the future that justifies the investment clearly required.”
Asked if voskhod i flight meant U.S.S.R. had “extended its lead over the United States in manned space flight,” Mr. Webb replied:
“This is hard to answer categorically but if I had to give a quick answer, I would say ‘Yes.’ ”
Asked when U.S. would overtake U.S.S.R. in manned space flight, Mr. Webb said:
“Well, first I think we must always keep in mind that our program including the developmental flights on the Saturn IB and the flights out to a quarter of a million miles with Saturn V are designed to meet United States needs for an operational capability out that far in space.
“If the flight capability of the Russian craft is extended to include these additional capabilities, then we will have a serious problem in catching up in the next few years. If their capability does not extend to the booster power necessary for the full range of operations out to the moon, then we will pass them in this decade, provided our present program is adequately funded and no unknown or unanticipated difficulties show up.” (Interview, NYT, 10/18/64, E5)

Dr. Dryden predicted that by the year 2000 astronauts’ trips to the moon “may Se somewhat commonplace. . . . The moon will also be serving as an important scientific station for radio astronomers . . . [and] many other kinds of scientists. . . . We may be maintaining sizable installations on the moon. . . .
“Beyond the moon it is probable that manned flights will have been made to Mars and possibly to the vicinities of other planets as well. . . . In space stations orbiting above the earth we shall likely be fabricating space vehicles; it is possible that we shall be using rockets, in ballistic trajectory through space, to deliver freight shipments from one continent to another. . . .
“Let us let our imagination roam to a hundred years from now. It seems certain that we will have developed the capability to move throughout llie solar system and will have sent at least exploratory expeditions to the outermost reaches. We will be considering the extension of our exploration of space to llie nearest stars, but I am somewhat doubtful that we can even in lliis period discover new sources of energy which will make lliis journey possible in llie lifetime of one man.
“It seems likely lliat within 100 years we will have established outposts in the form of stations on the moon and Mars. It is possible that we will have moved to a certain degree of colonization on Mars, but I doubt lliat this will take place on the moon, unless llie moon turns out to contain resources of great economic value to us here on earlli. The resources required for such extensive exploration of Mars will require cooperation among llie nations of llie earlli; otherwise it is not, likely to be accomplished. . . .” (Text)

“The company’s XB-70 has now completed four test flights acquiring millions of items of information, in a highly significant beginning of its test program.
“So far, the airplane has flown at altitudes up to 45,000 feet, at speeds up to Mach 1.4; with the wing tips deflected and up, and through various yaw, flutter and stability tests.
“In 34 days, during which test flights were accomplished, the XB-70 has flown at supersonic speeds for 55 minutes. Performance at takeoff, liftoff, climb out, and angle of climb has coincided almost exactly with flight simulator estimates. . . .” (naa S&id Skywriter, 10/30/64, 1)

He described “the Southern Crescent of the space program”—Cape Kennedy, Fla.; msfc, Huntsville, Ala.; Michoud Operations, La./Mississippi Test Facility; and msc, Houston, Tex.
“One of the central facts about this great complex of space activities ... is llie possibility lliat many varied research, development and production activities will gravitate in this direction. This is made likely by reasons of economics and of convenience.
“By and large, lliese will be activities lliat require heavy contributions from science and technology, and Arkansas and llie ollier states of llie Soulli are now in a position to get ready to take full advantage of the
prospect. Arkansas must be able to advance in such areas as electronics, in the development and use of new materials, in medical research related to the severe requirements of space, and the like. It must not only make provisions for suitable working and living conditions for scientists and engineers, it must also be farsighted in training its people as technicians and skilled workmen, for these are as essential in this kind of activity as the scientists and engineers. . . .” (Text)
October 30: Morris Forgash, president of United States Freight Co., gave his predictions of transportation in the year 2000, in address at National Defense Transportation Association conference in Frankfurt, Germany. Among his predictions: “By the year 2000 the hydrofoils will be the buslines of the oceans”; “people and things will be transported between all the more distant points on earth by rocket-powered craft.” He concluded:
“Before you mark off anything that I have predicted for the next three and a half decades look back on the startling developments of the recent past. The breaking of the sound barrier. Space travel. Substitution of a cushion of air for the ageless wheel. The broadcasting of a message of good will to the world by a President of the United States not by cable, phone, or radio, but from a satellite circling around the globe in outer space—then the erasure of the message and substitution of another while die satellite was in orbit. The Olympic games in Tokyo brought into the homes of people on the far side of the earth through the medium of a relay station in space. Multiply these miracles of science by the rate of change which is being constantly compounded and see if my predictions do not come out on the modest side even to the point of reticence.
“I believe the most important fact for us to understand is that transportation, though it opens new worlds and changes old concepts of time and distance, will not shape the world of 2000 A.D. Transportation is the servant of the people—the genie which makes their dreams come true—the magic carpet of their future—the mobility of their desires, their aspirations, and their resources. . . .” (Text, CR, 1/7/65, A70-74)

Franklin P. Dixon, NASA Director of Manned Planetary Mission Studies, said in a speech: “Our studies indicate that the next major phase in manned earth orbital operations should be a space station with a 6-9 man capacity. This would be specifically designed for long-duration earth orbital flights and would directly further the routine exploitation of near earth space for peaceful purposes. The studies on this concept have shown that the basic station module should have a usable total volume in the order of 8,000 cubic feet with continuous ‘floor’ areas of not less than 300 square feet.” (Text)
Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary and Acting Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, spoke at the awards banquet: “There is a wonderful thing about the space business. It has a vitality and a deep sense of challenge, which most other activities do not have. If it is not a way of life, it is at least a way of looking at life. The space program is the program for the optimist, the person who is willing to look ahead with confidence, the individual who sees no limits to what can be done and no horizons to the scope of doing. One of the
greatest benefits already obtained from the space program is its revitalizing effect upon our whole economy—our whole educational system— our whole attitude toward llie future. Let us use all our power of persuasion against any individual or any group who would slow down the pace of this program.” Referring to statements lliat llie military possibilities of space have been “downgraded,” Dr. Welsh said: “During llie four-year period of 1957 through 1960, space expenditures for the dod totaled $1 billion. On llie other hand, during the last four years, lliat is 1961 through 1964, llie dod spent about $4.6 billion on its space responsibility. The fact is that llie Department of Defense is annually spending about a billion and a hall dollars in space research and development. This includes projects in navigation, communications, observation, detection, booster development, scientific instrumentation, command and control techniques, interception, and manned and unmanned space flight.” He would make no prediction regarding next year’s space budget, but suggested lliat “space expenditures over the coming years, even with occasional plateaus, would be characterized by an upward trend.” Dr. Welsh confirmed the Russians were relying heavily upon unmanned Vostok spacecraft in their Cosmos program. He said llie Vostoks had accumulated “more than 2500 orbits”; since the seven Soviet manned flights to date accounted for only 10% of lliis, the balance must have been achieved in the more than 20 Vostok flights from Tyuratam range at llie 65° inclination. Unlike llie Cosmos satellites, these unmanned Vostoks had been recovered after as much as two weeks in orbit. Dr. Welsh also disclosed that Soviet launching reliability was “comparable” to the 85% attained by U.S. in past three years. (Text; A&A, 11/64,116; Dr.EdwardC. Welsh)
Dr. Charles S. Sheldon, staff member of llie National Aeronautics and Space Council, in a comparison of U.S. and Soviet space flights, said lliat 262 military and civilian launch vehicles had been launched by lliis country between 1957 and October of this year as opposed to at least 81 launched by the Russians. Of llie total U.S. launch attempts, 192 were successful, and 231 payloads were put into earlli orbit, eight were injected into escape trajectories, and 84 were listed as failures. (Text) Brig. Gen. Joseph S. Bleymaier, AFSC Space Systems Div. deputy for manned systems, said that studies by Jet Propulsion Laboratory and by General Electric, under JPL contract, showed lliat payload capacities of both Surveyor and Mariner could be doubled if the Titan III, rather llian the Atlas-Agena, were used to launch lliem. The GE study, he said, determined lliat the Voyager Mars soft-landing mission objectives could be accomplished more effectively if the lander and orbiter were launched as two separate Titan III payloads, rather than as a combined package atop a Saturn IB.

Joseph A. Walker, project pilot for NASA’s Flight Research Center, described the first flight of the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV). Walker said this was the first of several pilot familiarization and checkout (lights. Simulated lunar missions were scheduled for early 1965. The first flight consisted of three separate take-offs and landings. Total free flight time was just under one min., with a maximum altitude of approximately 10 ft. He used only the jet engine for lift power and did not activate the lift rockets. All eight of the standard control rockets were operated briefly.
The llrv was equipped with a jet engine that could be automatically regulated to counterbalance five-sixths- of the vehicle’s weight to compensate for the gravitational difference between the moon and earth. This engine was also used to provide take-off power. During forthcoming checkout flights, two hydrogen-peroxide rocket motors, capable of delivering from 100 to 500 lbs. thrust each, would be used to regulate lift. The program, in support of Project Apollo, was designed to study the piloting and operational procedures involved during the final phases of a manned lunar landing and during the initial portion of the lunar take-off.

Paper on launch vehicle engines by A. O. Tischler, Director of nasa oart Chemical Propulsion Div., and Leland F. Belew, Manager of msfc Engine Program Office, covered current status of solid- and liquid-propellant rocket engines for Saturn and Titan launch vehicles. The authors reported that the F-l engine represented “the largest thrust engine fired to date. Started in early 1959 the F-l engine has been under development for six years. Five F-l’s will be used in the first stage of the Saturn V vehicle to produce a take-off thrust of 7,500,000 pounds. . . .
“Nominal firing duration is 150 seconds and we expect better than 15 times that life to be in the engine at qualification. . . .
“[Design refinements to correct combustion-driven oscillations] have produced an engine which in the last five months has accumulated almost as much test time as in the previous five years. . . .” (Text) November 4: Dr. George E. Mueller, nasa’s Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, cited during a luncheon of the AIAA Third Manned Space Flight Meeting in Houston four important decisions made in the past ten years: “The first was in 1954 when as the result of the Von Neumann Committee’s recommendations we began the ballistic missile program on a top-priority basis. . . . The second decision a year later was to undertake the Vanguard program as the second priority effort, completely separate from the ballistic missile program. . . . The third decision . . . was the passage of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. . . . The fourth major decision was President Kennedy’s 1961 proposal to expand and accelerate United States space activity.” Dr. Mueller said that there is no such thing as unmanned exploration of space. “As sensor, manipulator, evaluator, and investigator in space, as the scope and range of our activities continue to increase, the role of man assumes increasing importance. Our challenge is to capitalize on his presence in space.” (Text)

November 5: mariner ni (Mars 64) was launched into interplanetary orbit from Cape Kennedy with an Atlas-Agena D launch vehicle, but spacecraft communications failed when fairing did not jettison, preventing solar panel deployment. The Agena stage pushed the mariner m into a parking orbit around the earth and coasted to the proper position for injection into a Mars trajectory. The Agena again ignited 32 min. after launching and sent the spacecraft toward Mars.
Tracking data indicated that the second-stage Agena D booster shut down four seconds early on the second burn, mariner ill’s four solar panels, designed to use power from the sun to recharge the spacecraft’s batteries, were prevented from deploying by failure of nose fairing to jettison. Further, the spacecraft did not align itself properly with the sun so that the communications antennas would be properly pointed.
In addition to TV equipment for taking pictures of the Martian surface, mariner in carried instruments to study radiation, space dust, and magnetic forces near Mars and in unmapped space after swinging past the planet. This launch marked the first use of the USAF’s new Agena D upper stage and also the first U.S. space mission requiring a second igniting of the Agena D.

November 8: Dr. Thomas B. Weber, formerly at Aerospace Medical Center, Brooks afb, Tex., and now manager of advanced research for space engineering at Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, Calif., said that all space-cabin simulation experiments so far have had to be called off within a few days because of accumulation of toxic elements in the closed atmospheres. “This may be the reason Russia’s recent three-man space flight, which was expected to last several days, ended after only 24 hours.” Dr. Weber continued, “Unless an answer is found, this is a definite threat to our own plans for a manned orbiting laboratory and it could delay the Apollo program to land men on the moon.”
Working under usaf contracts, Dr. Weber had devised instruments to collect and identify more than 400 contaminants given off by the human body and by space cabin equipment.

Dr. Whipple told reporters that the chances of a spacecraft being seriously damaged by meteoroids was about the same as being struck by lightning.
Dr. John W. Firor, Director of the High Altitude Observatory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research at Boulder, Colo., said astronauts on the moon would have to be exposed to solar flare radiation for “many hours” before they would suffer serious damage. Attempts to forecast solar flares accurately “have not shown any success,” Dr. Firor said. (Maloney, Houston Post, 11/17/64; Sullivan, NYT, 11/17/64,16)
Dr. Frank J. Malina, chairman of the Lunar International Laboratory (LIL) program at the International Academy of Astronautics in Paris, said: “The principal justification for the operation of a manned center on the moon on an international basis may well be a financial one.” He explained that it was estimated that with present rocket technology, it would cost about $5,000 per pound of payload carried from the earth to the moon, and that one man-hour on the moon would cost as much as $80,000. Dr. Malina also mentioned that plans for LIL' were begun before President Kennedy announced this country’s intention of going to the moon before the end of the decade.

Soviet scientists reported that the entire voskhod i space flight was conducted by the three-man crew without spacesuits. U.S.S.R. space physiologist, Dr. O. Gazenko, said that the absence of spacesuits made it possible to perform a number of experiments using sensors directly on the skin, even during boost and re-entry. Among these were measurements of the electrocardiogram, respiration rate, electroencephalogram, eye movements, and seism ocardiogram.
Dr. V. V. Antipov, a radiologist, said that voskhod preliminary results indicated a substantial contribution to knowledge about the effects -of space flight factors upon biological organisms. He said that significant changes revealed in tissue experiments showed that new, spherical fragments occurred in cells in all stages of division and had only been duplicated in Soviet research under extremely high g forces, such as 4,000 g. They had thus far been tied to the boost and descent phase of the flight, with the greatest number of changes occurring during the first hours of flight, and the least just before re-entry. Antipov also disclosed that in one voskhod experiment, a number of cells were flown which had been flown on previous space flights. He said this indicates that the tissues could maintain viability with repeated exposures, and possibly that some selection took place. By studying the ones which “selected themselves,” he said, a great advantage would be gained in calculating what happened to human cells.
Missiles and Rockets reported lliat during an interview Dr. Gazenko stated that due to the thermal and decompression advantages it offered,
helium would eventually 'be used as a diluent gas for spacecraft atmosphere instead of the nitrogen gas that had been used on all Soviet space shots to date. He said the subject is a matter of scientific controversy in the U.S.S.R., but that “undoubtedly” there would be a shift to helium at some time in the future. (M&R, 11/23/64, 14-15)
At a press conference, Dr. 0. G. Gazenko reiterated that the voskhod crew did not use space or pressure suits at all. He was asked when the Russians plan to rendezvous and dock two spacecraft and if they would both be manned.
“We will, of course, try to do this as soon as possible, but I have the feeling that it would be very nice to have two humans meet in space. . . . It is possible one will be a man and one will be a woman.” His answers were relayed to reporters by Dr. Boris Mandiovsky, a librarian from the Library of Congress.
Dr. Gazenko, giving an oral summary of his much longer paper, said medical results of seven Russian manned space flights had not shown any insurmountable barriers to space flight.
“The analogy of the physiological data obtained during manned orbital flight of up to five days duration proves that man, specially selected and trained, can satisfactorily tolerate all orbital flight stresses,” Dr. Gazenko continued. “However, as can be seen in the material, important individual variations are noted. We have to devote special attention to this factor in future cosmonaut selection and training,” he said.
He told scientists that there are problems still to be solved for true long space flights, and expressed the hope that between Russia and the United States there could be closer cooperation in solving these problems. (Houston Post, 11/18/64)
Col. Charles E. Yeager, Commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards afb, Calif., called for an end to the use of heavy work-retarding pressure suits. “We are relying entirely too much on the suit to pull the guy out of a problem,” he said. (Houston Post, 11/19/64)
Astronaut M. Scott Carpenter called for a “new approach” in development of wearing apparel for astronauts in space. He termed the pressurized spacesuit “the greatest single handicap we have to operations in space. To do useful work is almost impossible. I’m sure there is a better way.” Carpenter said that he had proposed an investigation of a “spray-on” spacesuit that would permit astronauts to move freely about die cabin of the capsule.

November 17: NASA conducted two sounding rocket launches from USNS Croatan, near Wallops Island, Va., to determine whether or not ship’s radar could track metalized-mylar spheres with sufficient accuracy to obtain significant geophysical data. Both payloads, each consisting of two metalized-mylar spheres, were provided by Univ. of Michigan. The first rocket, a Nike-Apache, reached 136-mi. altitude and two spheres ejected and inflated, but ship’s radar did not acquire track. Land-based radars did obtain sphere trajectory data. The second rocket, a Nike-Cajun, reached 92.6-mi. altitude, its spheres ejecting and inflating as planned but deflating earlier than expected. Ship’s radar provided questionable position data which would have to be analyzed further. (Wallops Release 64-86; NASA Rpts. srl)

•	mariner iv Mars probe finally locked its sensor on the star Canopus after
fixes on three wrong stars. Jet Propulsion Laboratory officials noted that picking up wrong stars was not critical in the early stages of the flight. If the mariner iv had not dropped these wrong fixes of its own accord, the action could have been commanded from the ground. Only if Canopus were in the sensor’s sights would the TV camera be aimed at the Martian surface when mariner iv flew past the planet 7% months
from now; only with Canopus in view would scientists know the spacecraft’s attitude with the precision needed for a midcourse rocket firing of maximum accuracy to refine the course of the trajectory and bring the mariner iv within about 8,600 mi. of Mars instead of the presently anticipated distance of 151,000 mi.

November 30—December 3: James T. Ramey, a commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission, analyzed the use of cost-effectiveness techniques in a speech to the Atomic industrial Forum in San Francisco. He said: “The cost effectiveness technique assumes end-applications or requirements, and then figures out the costs of alternative systems of achieving equal or greater effectiveness ... it would seem that the requirements system, and the cost effectiveness techniques, tend to favor the status quo in technology, if not in economics or politics. . . .
“This leads me to the conclusion that the underlying problem is really whose judgment and recommendations should receive most weight in determining which development programs and projects should go forward. Should these decisions be made by the science advisors and coordinators, and budget specialists who have no direct programmatic responsibility and are not accountable for failure to carry out the directives of the President and the Congress? Or should the judgment of the developmental agency which has the statutory responsibility for the program and the technical depth and experience receive the most weight? . . . I have a certain affinity for giving considerable weight to the judgment of the development agency, which, in regard to atomic energy, would be the aec and its laboratories. In regard to nuclear energy in space, it would be aec and nasa, and to some extent the Air Force. . . .
“I am quite optimistic about achieving the great possibilities of atomic energy in space. I firmly believe the atom will provide the means for the propulsion and servicing of manned space ships for moon missions following Apollo, and to and from the planets . . .” (Av. Wk., 1/11/65,

•	General Curtis E. LeMay, usaf Chief of Staff, was interviewed in General
Electric Forum and discussed aerospace power’s contribution to national security. “In recent months, the area of direct technical concern to the Air Force has 'become much broader. For example, we must now press for technical superiority not only in aircraft but also in missiles, space systems, and command and control systems that are responsive to the compressed time scale of military operations. We cannot afford to fall behind in any of these fields, because the potential enemy can be expected to exploit Jill of llie important technical gaps lliat might appear.” LeMay said that “chiefly because of llie cost factor, we are not exploiting anything like the total amount of technology that we lliink might be useful. Certainly we would like to do more, but our r&d outlay already comprises 18 percent of llie Air Force’s total budget and must be balanced against ollier needs.” (GE Forum, 10-12/64,14-17)

December 5: mariner iv underwent a critical course change to make it possible for the craft to take useful pictures of Mars during the fly-by in July 1965. In response to commands radioed from earth, a small rocket on the base of the spacecraft, which could add anything between an eighth of a mile an hour to 188 miles an hour to the craft’s speed, was fired. Initial indications were that the correction was successful and accurate.
Severed days later, tracking equipment and associated computers confirmed that the rocket firing had produced three changes in mariner iv’s flight path: (1) the Mars fly-by from 151,000 mi. in front of Mars to a closest approach of 5,400 mi. behind Mars; (2) the arrival date from July 16, 1965, to July 14; and (3) the flight path past Mars from the leading edge to the trailing edge of Mars. The maneuver was followed by sun and Canopus reacquisition. A second midcourse maneuver would not be required.
The midcourse rocket used by mariner iv was the first to be used by this country that was capable of a second firing, (nasa Release 64-310; Witkin, NYT, 12/6/64,67; Miles, Wash. Post, 12/6/64)

•	Scientists at Johns Hopkins Univ. announced observations from an un-
manned balloon on Oct. 27 that might indicate life on Venus. Experiments showed that the clouds covering Venus were composed of water in the form of ice particles and that the surface temperature was close to —40° F, with only a few degrees difference between the light and dark sides of the planet. An earlier baloon flight in February had revealed that the air above the clouds was rich in water vapor. The scientists theorized that if there were water vapor, some of its molecules would be broken up by ultraviolet sunlight into oxygen and hydrogen; an atmosphere with oxygen and water vapor would be a propitious environment for life.
Radiotelescopes on earth and on the mariner ii space probe, which had passed within 21,000 mi. of Venus in December 1962, indicated the surface temperature was 800° F. However, since interpretation of radiotelescope waves as an indication of temperature had neither been proven nor universally accepted, the Johns Hopkins scientists suggested that previous findings might only indicate a large amount of lightning-like electrical activity in the turbulent atmosphere of Venus.

One of these proposals would slice the scientific programs of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to the bone and concentrate the NASA budget on the Apollo manned lunar landing program. Some portions of the scientific community have been making this charge without much justification for several years. If NASA does virtually abandon its highly successful scientific exploration program now, the howl from scientists will rise in a swift crescendo. It would be a major mistake to make such a drastic switch in what is now a pretty well-balanced NASA effort.” (Av. Wk., 12/7/64,11)

December 8: Apollo spacecraft (BP-23) was subjected to simulated catastrophic failure of its launch vehicle in a successful test of the abort escape system at White Sands, N. Mex. Apollo command and service boilerplate modules were boosted on a Little Joe II launch vehicle to the region of maximum dynamic pressure at 29,000-ft. altitude and launch vehicle failure was simulated. The escape vehicle, mated to the spacecraft by a connecting tower, yanked the Apollo free of Little Joe and carried it almost two miles higher. The Little Joe rocket fell to earth; the Apollo modules were returned gently to the ground by three 88-ft. parachutes. This was the third successful test of functioning of the 33-ft. launch escape tower designed to jettison the command module and three Apollo astronauts to safety in an abort before or during the launch phase of a Saturn V mission. It was the first test of the boost-protective cover subsystem, a contoured shell fitting over the command module and designed to protect the docking mechanism of Lunar Excursion Module (lem) from excessive heating during high temperatures of first-stage flight. It also protected command module windows from exhaust of the launch escape motor, (nasa Release 64—299)

•	A unique optical system known as a laser range finder was announced by
rca’s Aerospace Systems Div. and U.S. Army Electronics Command. The unit operated by sending a very narrow beam pulse of red light toward the target at the speed of light. After reflection from the target,
the red light of the laser beam was received and sensed by a phototube in the range finder. An electronic counter measured the elapsed time between the transmitted pulse and the return reflection and converted the elapsed time instantaneously into a measure of distance.
Similar systems had suffered from loss of alignment with use between the receiving telescope, which sensed the reflected laser light, and the sighting telescope by which the receiver was aimed at the target. The new design combined these two telescopes into one unit that allowed a lighter, more precise, and more rugged system to be fabricated. {Marshall Star, 12/9/64,5-6)
December 9: Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin told the Soviet parliament that expenditures for defense would drop by four per cent or 500 million rubles ($555 million) in 1965. He also declared that his government had acted after being informed by American officials that U.S. planned to reduce its military budget in the coming year. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy said later that the embassy had no knowledge that such information had been given to the Soviet government. In his budget message, Premier A. N. Kosygin told the Supreme Soviet that “people of science must do a lot for us to be able to provide more material benefits for the satisfaction of the population’s growing requirements,” complained that the opportunities for doing this “have been by no means exploited.” After calling for scientific breakthroughs to the production process in chemistry, electronics, transistor technology, and biology, Kosygin said: “There are major shortcomings in scientific research planning. Our plans do not make use in good time of all that is progressive and useful in research discoveries. For this reason, scientific discoveries and technical inventions not infrequently become outdated and lose their practical worth.
“Utilization of the latest achievements of science and technology should be made one of the main criteria in the appraisal of economic plans and their fulfillment. Unfortunately, many people employed in industry continue to regard further capital investments as the main and only source of increased output and do not really strive hard for the rapid introduction of scientific and technical achievements, which could produce a considerably greater effect than additional capital investments. Scientific and technical progress opens new horizons for a radical improvement in quality and an expansion of the range of goods produced.” (Av.

December 10: Final Gemini unmanned flight test (GT-2) from etr was postponed after a last-second engine misfire on the Titan II rocket. The trouble occurred 1.7 seconds after the Titan II booster engines ignited: loss of hydraulic pressure caused one of the two engine nozzles to swivel out of place; and automatic system sensed this and immediately extinguished both engines in the rocket’s first stage one second before lift-off. A NASA spokesman said that one of the nozzle tubes received a slight crack as a result of the malfunction and that extensive checking of all systems must be completed before a decision would be made as to whether the entire first stage would be replaced.
The Titan II was to have lifted the 6,900-lb. Gemini capsule to 106 mi. in the suborbital flight and then accelerated it to faster and hotter reentry than normal. A parachute landing in the Atlantic was projected for the capsule and recovery planned. Chief goals of the flight, second
in the Gemini series, would have been to test the heat shield as well as control, life support, and other systems.
NASA said the delay meant the first manned Gemini flight would not take place until the second quarter of 1965. GT—2 would be attempted again in January. (Hoffman, N.Y. Her. Trib. 12/10/64; Balt. Sun.

December 11: Atlas-Centaur 4 (AC-4) hurled its Centaur second stage into orbit around the earth with a mass model of the Surveyor lunar spacecraft in its nose. The first-burn performance of the Centaur rocket sent the stage into a nearly circular parking orbit of 100 mi. perigee and 106 mi. apogee. The second bum should have put the rocket into an oval path taking it out as much as 5,000 mi. from earth; however, the attempt to restart the RL-10 engines failed and the stage began to tumble and roll. After about 15 hr. in orbit, the
Centaur stage and its Surveyor dummy payload re-entered the atmosphere over the South Pacific east of Australia and disintegrated.

Future crews would be selected “as medical teams as opposed to individuals,” said one Soviet journal. The men would also be picked on the basis of their medical compatibility— to see that one man’s personal germs, bacteria, or virus did not infect other members of the team.

•	NASA designer of echo i, William J. O’Sullivan, said he believed the satel-
lite still had its spherical shape after over four years in orbit. An optical investigation made by the Goodyear Aerospace Corp. for NASA Langley Research Center indicated that the satellite’s aluminum surface—which made the balloon highly reflective of light and radar waves, regulated its temperature, and protected the plastic film from space hazards—still reflected like a mirror. From calculations using the known reflective characteristics of echo I when it was launched and his interpretation of the Goodyear measurements, O’Sullivan concluded that echo I “is still essentially spherical and that its very thin coating of aluminum has suffered no measurable degradation in specularity or reflectivity.” (LaRC Release)
December 14: Missiles and Rockets reported that NASA was reviewing the pros and cons of Project Orion (an advanced nuclear-pulse rocket propulsion concept) to determine whether the agency could justify a mission requirement for a nuclear-pulse vehicle—such as a fast manned trip to Mars, dod was scheduled to drop its research in January 1965, because the Air Force could not establish a mission requirement. Both dod and aec would join in financing a joint program if NASA established the mission requirement. Project Orion would not in any case be available in the same time period as solid-core nuclear reactors, whose development was already well underway. (Wilks, M&R, 12/14/64, 12-14)
•	Langley Research Center aerospace engineer Dewey L. Clemmons, Jr.,
presented a paper at the Symposium on the Establishment of a European Geodetic Network for Artificial Satellites held in Paris, France, describing the U.S. Passive Geodetic Satellite (Pageos) planned for launch during the first half of 1966. He said: “The satellite will be an aluminum-coated sphere 100 feet (30.48 meters) in diameter, a near replica of echo I (1960 Iota 1) that was launched by the United States on August 12, 1960. No instrumentation will be attached to the surface of the Pageos satellite. Pageos will serve the geodesist by simply acting as a point source of light in the sky as it reflects the incident sunlight. Simultaneous photographs of this light source against the star background, taken by two or more widely separated ground-based cameras, will enable geodesists to determine the spatial coordinates of each camera position. An interconnected series of camera positions can be established that will cover the entire surface of the earth, thereby permitting geometric determination of each camera position within a single reference system. The use of this satellite for geodetic purposes will continue for at least five years during which the necessary photo-grammetric observations can be made and to provide a purely geometric determination of the shape and size of the earth.” (Text; AP, NYT, 12/15/64,41)

•	At a symposium sponsored by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Dr.
Norman F. Ness likened the earth to a kind of comet with a long magnetic tail that extended for an unknown distance. The “new look” was drawn from results of the first detailed mapping of llie earth’s magnetic field on the nighttime side of the magnetosphere by explorer xvm (imp I, Interplanetary Monitoring Platform), launched Nov. 26,1963. Until recently, scientists had believed lliat the earth’s magnetosphere was basically spherical; however, data from explorer xviii indicate that countless magnetic lines of force stretched out like the tail of a comet to an unknown distance in space, apparently beyond the moon. Within this comet-like tail, the lines of force in the Northern Hemisphere were directed towards the sun; in llie Southern Hemisphere, away from llie sun. In between, there was a neutral zone.
Dr. Ness characterized this neutral zone, which had been hypothesized but never before detected, as a thin sheet which was a permanent part of the earth’s environment and virtually void of any magnetic activity. Though the neutral zone’s exact role was unknown, Dr. Ness speculated that it might be responsible for formation of the auroras, creation of the Van Allen radiation belt, and presence of llie gegenschein. Ness concluded lliat in view of llie evidence from explorer xviii, “The only difference between the earlli and a comet is lliat the earth possesses a strong magnetic field and comets do not.” (Simons, Wash.

•	Dr. Eugene B. Konecci of llie nasc staff addressed llie National Space
Club on llie Soviet bioastronautics program. He said that although
some American scientists had been critical of the amount and kinds of data released by the Soviets, Soviet scientists appeared to be desirous of further opening their research in technological areas such as life support.
On choosing the proper atmosphere for space flight, Dr. Konecci said: “Some American scientists . . . advocated a two-gas system. . . . Others chose a 5 psi 100% oxygen system. . . . Animal and human experiments to date indicate that there are no apparent physiological effects due to 100% oxygen up to and beyond 30 days.
“What is important to mention is that we had the technology as part of our aircraft system in handling 100% oxygen in low pressure-high pressure and liquid states, and we have extended this use to space cabins. The Soviets . . . have not been confronted with 100% oxygen problems. Because of the near sea-level atmosphere in their Vostok and Voskhod flights . . . they were concerned more with weightlessness and radiation effects. . . .”
Dr. Konecci said that both U.S. and the U.S.S.R. had much research work ahead. “The Soviets have still to fly their life support systems for the full designed parameter ... in Vostok this was supposed to be ten days with later literature indicating a twelve-day capability. I expect the Voskhod has the comparable capability, that is, about twelve days, but because of the three-man crew this would in fact mean a threefold increase of their life support capability, i.e. on a man-per-day basis. I think we can also expect the Soviets to attempt manned rendezvous maneuvers. I really do not believe at this time that they will attempt manned extravehicular experiments until (1) they have a better space suit, which they appear to be working on; (2) that they have a better fix on the possible decompression sickness (bends or dysbarism) problems of decompressing from a sea-level atmosphere with nitrogen to a compatible space suit environment; and (3) until we perform the Gemini intentional decompression and extravehicular experiments.” (Text)

“The Department of Defense and NASA have gone a long way toward answering the questions I raised several weeks ago. I suggested at that time that perhaps a great savings could be achieved without sacrifice to either the nasa or Air Force responsibilities in space by harmonizing mol and Apollo-X. I have been told that the Air Force and NASA will take advantage of each other’s technology and hardware development with all efforts directed at achievement of a true space laboratory as an end goal. The review underway by both agencies will strengthen the total space effort.
“We should take full advantage of the technology and ground-support systems developed for Project Apollo. The object of the Senate Space Committee in raising questions about mol and Apollo-X was to accomplish the wisest use of personnel and money, not in criticism of either project.”
New York Times reporter John Finney interpreted Sen. Anderson’s statement as an indication that the Administration “had gone along with his [Sen. Anderson’s] suggestions.

the leading Soviet authority on radio emanations of the moon, had found evidence they believed showed that the upper layer of the moon’s surface was saturated with meteoric matter distinguishing it both chemically and in mineral content from deep layers. Results were obtained during the complete lunar eclipse of last Dec. 30 observed from Ussurisk, in far eastern Siberia. Troitsky’s group made use of the fact that the lunar surface cooled during eclipses and that the cooling caused a drop in the intensity of radio emanations. The Russians worked out the relationship between the decrease of radio emanations from llie obscured part of llie moon and the physical properties of the surface. Investigating the properties of llie uppermost porous layer of llie moon’s surface to a depth of about four inches, llie Russians established lliat its electrical conductivity was 50% to 100% greater than that of the underlying rocks and concluded that the two layers differed in chemical composition and mineral content. The conductivity of the top layer was found to correspond to that of meteorites, confirming the hypothesis that bombardment by meteorites and the settling of meteoritic dust played an important part in shaping the uppermost layer of llie moon. {NYT, 12/21/64)

December 21: NASA Administrator James E. Webb told the Commercial Club of Chicago: “There is an analogy between our national space program and our national history.

•	The Air Force version of the controversial F-lll fighter-bomber, formerly
called the tfx, made a successful but somewhat abbreviated maiden flight from Carswell afb, Tex. (the site of the General Dynamics Corp. plant that built the plane). Piloted by Richard L. Johnson and Val E. Prahl, the 1,650-mph aircraft performed all the items on the test program that were possible with the malfunctioning wing flaps. The variable-geometry wings, capable of a 70° sweep, were kept in 26° position during the first flight. In 21 min. of flight, the F—111 achieved an altitude of 17,000 ft. and a speed of 230 mph. On takeoff it required less than half the runway used by conventional jet planes. The Navy version of the F-lll was scheduled to fly by mid-1965. (Witkin, NYT, 12/22/64, 12; upi, Chic.

science and technology programs in budget-making conferences at his Texas ranch. Dr. Donald S. Hornig, the President’s special assistant for science and technology, said in Austin Press Conference that the significance of his presence as a participant in all meetings was that Johnson was looking at the “totality” of the various Government enterprises supporting science and technology in an effort to pursue a balanced program. Hornig said the Federal government was spending about $15 billion—roughly 15% of its budget—on scientific research, technical development, test, and engineering programs with about half this amount spent by dod. Dr. Hornig also said he believed the hundreds of millions of dollars going into the effort to put an American on the moon by 1970 was well spent because “the moon is a very interesting place scientifically.” It will “take a lot of going” to achieve that goal, he said, but present schedules “will allow it.” (Wash.

Shapiro of mit’s Lincoln Laboratory proposed use of radar as a test for Einstein’s general theory of relativity: radar pulses would be sent to one of the solar system’s inner planets, either Venus or Mercury, and the time-lapse before the radar echoes’ return measured on the earth. According to Einstein’s theory, when the radar beam passed close enough to the sun to encounter a very strong gravitational field, the radar waves should slow down. The slowdown should be sufficient to delay return of the radar echoes by as much as 0.0002 seconds, a time interval accurately measurable by electronic techniques. {Wash. Post, 12/28/64)

policies affecting nonprofit organizations performing design, technical direction, and systems engineering functions for the military services. “We have a continuing interest in finding out whether salaries higher than the government scale paid by some of these organizations are really necessary and justified or are only a way of indirectly paying higher [wages] for government work,” Campbell said. Another area of prime concern to GAO was relinquishment to nongovernment organizations of technical direction and similar activities it considered Government management functions.
dod had already clamped fiscal ceilings on six of these organizations to prevent their growth and was inviting increased industry competition in the areas of technical direction and systems engineering.
Campbell told Aviation Week and Space Technology that “if we are faced with any intention to sustain permanently some of these organizations as arms of government, we would have to look into the situation very carefully and thoroughly.”
In commenting on NASA’s approach to nonprofit organizations, Ernest W. Brackett, Asst.

Wk., 12/28/64, 9) December 28-30: Dr. John H. Wolfe of NASA Ames Research Center suggested the probable source of Van Allen belt radiation at the meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Seattle. Dr. Wolfe said the Van Allen radiation belts probably had their source in the cometlike tail of the magnetosphere extending from the dark side of earth away from the sun. Spiraling protons and alpha particles emitted by the sun were shielded from solar wind in this area. Affected only by
the geomagnetic field, they were picked up by the magnetic lines of force and conveyed to llie Van Allen belts.
New data collected by particle energy spectrometers and ollier instruments aboard explorer xxi imp-b (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform) and ogo I (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory) led to this conclusion. Data collected from as far into space as 96,000 mi. revealed that interaction of llie solar wind and the geomagnetic field around llie sunlit side of earth created a boundary region 2Yz earth diameters lliick at a distance of five earth diameters from llie point on earlli closest to llie sun. This expanded to six diameters thick 90° around earth.
Hydromagnetic effects in this boundary deflected solar radiation around earlli and prevented it from penetrating directly to llie relatively low altitudes of the Van Allen belts except during the more energetic solar storms.
Satellite data also indicated that llie comet-like tail of earth extended directly along llie line from llie sun through earth, rather than being slightly deflected as had been believed. Wolfe said the tail seemed less tapered and more nearly cylindrical than had been expected, and extended at least as far as the orbit of the moon, (arc Release 65-2; AP, Detroit News, 1/8/65; M&R, 1/18/65, 28)

•	A policy statement issued by the Committee on Science in the Promotion
of Human Welfare of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (aaas) charged that social and political pressures on the scientific community arising from such major U.S. space programs as Apollo, Starfish, and West Ford constituted a “serious erosion of the integrity of science.” The report was issued following a five-day meeting held by the association in Montreal, Canada.
Commenting on the “spare race” aspects of NASA’s program, the committee said the pattern for orderly development of research had been altered by the “essentially political decision to pursue project Apollo.” The report concluded that Apollo did not appear to be based on the orderly systematic extension of basic scientific investigations.
Another NASA program to come under fire at the AAAS meeting was the Voyager Mars exploration project attacked by Dr. Barry Commoner,
professor of plant physiology at Washington University. Dr. Commoner said finding life in any form on Mars would have tremendous scientific significance, and that he was not opposed to the basic idea of searching for life on the planet. “I simply feel this country is not yet prepared to make a commitment of this scope,” he said. “We could at this time be a lot closer to resolving this question if the scientific community had been given the opportunity to fully discuss it.” He said even though the commitment had been made it was not too late to discuss fully the question of life on Mars before the 1971 launch. He said he hoped Congressional space committees would ask for complete justifications on the Voyager project. (Av. Wk., 1/4/65, 18; Abraham, Phil. Eve. BuU., 12/28/64; AP, Wash. Eve. Star, 12/28/64)

•	A pea-sized rocket motor, called a cap motor, weighing less than three-
hundredths of an ounce, might be given its first trial in space next year as a stabilizing motor for a Tiros weather satellite. Conceived by the Wright Aeronautical Div. of the Curtiss-Wright Corp. in Wood Ridge, N.J., it was made entirely of plastic, contained igniter material which would be touched off by an electrical impulse, a solid propellant, a combustion chamber, and a flared exhaust nozzle. A string of the expendable motors would be mounted on a tape that would feed through a half-pound triggering device and fire them one at a time or in sequence. One cap motor would yield a pound of thrust for about two-hundredths of a second. Two cap motor units, each containing 300 cap motors, would be placed on Tiros for the test in an attempt to lengthen its useful life beyond an expected three months. The satellite must spin at a certain number of revolutions a minute to stabilize its cameras; the slight friction in its trajectory would tend to slow it down. Computers on the ground would calculate the amount of spin to be imparted; aboard Tiros, 100 cap motors would be fired in each burst. (Hudson, NYT, 12/30/64,1,17)
•	Prof. Rene J. Dubos of the Rockefeller Institute charged at the Montreal
meeting of the AAAS that present-day biology was almost completely irrelevant to the study of the nature of man. He said that the proper study of man’s nature should concern itself with the evolved patterns of physiological responses to a changing environment—what he would call “humanistic biology.” Not only would this approach turn up much new knowledge about “humaness,” he said, but it would also provide a better understanding of the uniqueness of the individual.
Prof. Dubos stated he was not discussing psychology, a social science. Man now possessed technical means for manipulating his mental and physiological processes and might soon develop ways to alter his inheritance and so direct the course of his evolutionary fate. “This means that mankind may soon be faced with decisions of immense importance that must be made in the light of the proper kind of biological knowledge,” he said. “The glory of the coming age,” he continued, “must be conceived within the framework of man’s nature—of his biological limitations as well as his potentialities.” (Osmundsen, NYT, 12/30/64,

•	Paul G. Johnson, of the AEC-NASA Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, said in
an article in Astronautics and Aeronautics that solid-core nuclear rockets
would power the next generation of manned space vehicles. “The exact way in which nuclear rockets will be used in the space program will depend on many factors other than payload comparisons. One of the primary influences will be the relative emphasis placed on manned operations in earth orbit, on the moon, and to the near planets. An equally strong influence will be the experience in the nuclear-rocket development program, which will indicate the possible characteristics and availability dates of propulsion systems.” (A&A, 12/64, 22-28)
During December: In the British Interplanetary Society’s Spaceflight, Brian J. Ford suggested that the first men on the moon might be imperiled by the residue of an electric charge which he said formed its craters. Mr. Ford proposed the theory that the moon’s craters were caused by a gigantic electrical discharge when the earth and moon were still hot and close together, and said that he had reproduced the theoretical conditions in miniature in a laboratory. He had found that electrical discharge created craters which showed the characteristic central peak of a lunar crater and formed other corroborating detail. He suggested that the moon might still carry an electrostatic charge from this original discharge which “might seriously imperil” the first men to land there, (upi, Chic. Trib., 12/28/64)
•	In a report to the Atomic Industrial Forum, Frank Deluzio, staff director
of the Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, called for increased funds for Kiwi and Nerva and also urged that the suspended Rift nuclear rocket program be reactivated. He suggested that studies be begun to substitute a nuclear reactor for the chemical engines in the giant Saturn V rocket. “While it is admitted that nuclear propulsion comes into its own in the large scale manned missions to the planets,” Deluzio said, “. . . nuclear stages should be committed to earlier programs, such as lunar landings late in the Apollo program. The integration of a nuclear stage with the Saturn launch vehicle should be done at the earliest possible moment so that proper experience and confidence can be obtained . . . This will increase the utility of the Saturn for a great number of years; it means a high return to the nation for its investment in the Saturn, its ground support, related systems, and industrial capabilities.” Deluzio also urged that nuclear rocket development remain the province of aec.

During December: Karl G. Harr, Jr., Pres, of Aerospace Industries Assn., editorialized: “To those familiar with the technical achievements of the past few years there is no doubt that aviation is on the threshold of its brightest era. . . . Enough is known of the potential of the new aeronautical technology to predict that all types of aviation—military, airline, and general aviation—will be completely transformed in the next two decades. The day of the manned military airplane is far from over. Today’s civil jet transports, which enjoy a high reputation, are far from the ultimate in economical flying machines. The usefulness of all types of aircraft will be vastly improved, and they will be much cheaper to operate in the future.
“Perhaps even more important will be the widespread benefits of the new aeronautical technology outside of aviation. In the past, aeronautical technology, which has provided major advances in high performance engines, efficient air flow design, lightweight structures and material, and high reliability, was put to wide use after it was given in aviation. . . . This pattern of transfer of aeronautical technology will not change. In fact, the opportunity should be greater in the future because the jump in efficiency now considered possible for aircraft structure and powerplant technology is greater than anything yet experienced. . . .” (Aerospace, Winter 64r-8-9)
During 1964: The deepening and broadening of the U.S. space program continued at an accelerated pace in 1964. The U.S. orbited a total of 76 payloads, of which four were deep-space probes, while the U.S.S.R. orbited 35, of which two were deep-space probes. Of the U.S. total NASA orbited 23 payloads. Other major NASA launches (not included in orbital total) were one unsuccessful attempt at orbit (Beacon satellite) and 5 suborbital tests of a burgeoning roster of new launch vehicles, spacecraft, and space equipment.
dod’s launch program continued to be numerically larger than NASA’s, with 53 satellites successfully orbited during the year.
NASA’s most publicized flight of the year was the RANGER vn flight to the moon with its close-in photography of the moon. Other solid achievements were apt weather photos from tiros viii and the much improved clarity and coverage of weather photos from the first advanced research weather satellite, NIMBUS I. The first generation of active communications satellites concluded with syncom hi, which was maneuvered into the first truly synchronous orbit of the space age and performed beyond design requirements as a communications relay between Asia and the U.S. A significant scientific contribution was made by explorer xvn, which in 1964 mapped the earth’s magnetosphere and found it, instead of the sphere it was previously thought, to be a tremendously elongated comet-like shape. In flight tests Gemini and Apollo spacecraft moved nearer to qualifying as man-rated. The Saturn I completed its seventh (out of 7) successful test flight and orbited a new world weight record of 39,000 lbs. The Centaur continued a successful flight-test program to work the bugs out of the first liquid-hydrogen engines in an operational space vehicle. In ground tests the Saturn IB and V launch vehicles took significant strides in testing of new large engines find of complete stages. In advanced research two achievements of high promise were the full-power runs of solid-core nuclear rocket engines that confirmed the engineering feasibility of
nuclear rocket engines with their tremendous increases in specific impulse over chemical-fueled engines, and the successful use of laser in satellite tracking, promising a new order of tracking accuracy for geodetic and ollier uses.
In DOD’s launch program, llie most publicized flight was that of Titan III-A on Dec. 10, when llie big booster for the proposed MOL successfully flight-tested its crucial transtage. Also dod continued its policy of launch economy willi 8 multiple-satellite launchings, including one (Jan. 11) in which a single Thor-Agena D booster launched 5 satellites.
The most publicized event of llie Soviet space program in 1964 was its orbiting of voskhod I, a new 3-man spacecraft, willi 2 of the crew not trained pilots.
For both the U.S. and Russia, one major effort in each program remained a question mark at the end of llie year. Each country had a deep-space probe (mariner iv and zond ii) enroute to Mars, due for flyby in July 1965. Perhaps never in its seven years had llie space age offered such a direct confrontation as this promised to be. (hhr-s; hhn-48 ; nasa Release 64-321; A&A, 64, passim.)
During 1964: Soviet scientists P. M. Bayevsky and K. I. Zhukov reported in llie U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences’ Journal, Cosmic Research, lliat two of their cosmonauts had suffered a rhyllim instability in llieir heartbeats while in space. The condition, cardiac arrhythmia, was observed in both Valery Bykovsky, who spent five days aloft, and Valentina Tereshkova, who orbited the globe for 71 hrs. Both flights were made in June
1963.	Changes were attributed to “normal” reactions to weightlessness, but llie doctors warned that llie condition should be watched closely on future iong-duration flights since it could be a clue to more serious “palliologic changes,” including a possibly fatal heart attack.
Dr. W. Randolph Lovelace, NASA Director of Space Medicine, saw the electrocardiograms while in Russia and said they showed only “variations we’d expect.” NASA doctors agreed that cardiac arrhythmia should be watched as a potential danger signal but said lliey had seen “nothing dangerous” so far in U.S. astronauts’ heart rhyllim changes, (tns, Bylinsky, Huntsville Times, 12/27/64)
•	The impact of budgetary restraints upon llie Nation’s research and devel-
opment programs was marked in industry, Government agencies, and llie university scientific community, John Finney claimed in llie New York Times. Employment in the aerospace industry dropped from
1,186,000	in August 1963 to 1,112,000 in September 1964, and manufacturers were forced to turn to civilian products to augment sales. Limiting of nasa funds forced postponement of some of llie follow-up programs for Apollo, such as a manned orbiting laboratory. Universities whose research programs depended heavily on Federal research support were having difficulty in obtaining funds to complete projects already undertaken and could no longer expect liberal Government support for llieir research proposals.

• Series of six Sandia Corp. Nike-Tomahawk sounding rockets was launched from May to August. The six Nike-Tomahawks, which reached altitudes of about 300 km. (186 mi.), were launched from the Island of Kania, as part of U.S. readiness program for use if space testing of nuclear devices was resumed. Experiment instrumentation for the series was provided by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory scientists. Objective of the experiment was to obtain precise measurements of radiations in the sun’s corona. Another purpose was to demonstrate feasibility of using relatively inexpensive, spin-stabilized, ballistically pointed rockets for solar x-ray spectroscopy. Results of this research were lated reported at the December meeting of the American Geophysical Union (agu). (oar Review, 12/64,22)
During the space age: As of the close of 1964, nasa had placed 70 spacecraft into earth orbit, lunar trajectory, or solar orbit since the birth of NASA on Oct. 1,1958. Of this number 52 were still orbiting as of Dec, 31,1964, and 21 were still transmitting signals. Some 55 million data points were being received daily at gsfc, recorded, and stored on magnetic tape at the rate of about 100,000 reels per year. Three of the 70 spacecraft impacted on the moon; 15 re-entered the earth’s atmosphere and burned up. Of the 31 silent satellites in orbit, 6 were in orbit about the sun, 25 about the earth. Satellites still transmitting meaningful data included one deep-space probe (mariner IV), 5 communications satellites (plus the beacon on passive communications satellite echo ii) , 3 weather satellites, 10 scientific satellites.
