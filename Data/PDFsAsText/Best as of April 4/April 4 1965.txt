January 1965
January 1: Operation of syncom ii and syncom iii communications satellites was transferred to DOD by NASA, which had completed its R&D experiments. Telemetry and command stations and range and range-rate equipment operated by NASA for the Syncom program would be transferred to DOD along with the satellites. DOD had furnished the communications ground stations used to relay transmissions via the two Syncoms for the past two years and would provide NASA with certain telemetry and ranging data of continuing scientific and engineering interest, syncom ill was to prove useful in DOD’s Vietnam communications.

•	About 500 employees of the Manned Spacecraft Center’s Florida Opera-
tions were transferred to the Kennedy Space Center, effective today, under a realignment announced Dec. 24, 1964, by NASA Hq. Elements of the manned space flight organization were regrouped to meet the requirements imposed by concurrent Gemini and Apollo launch schedules. (msc Roundup, 1/6/65, 1)
•	Two hrs. and 20 min. of radio signals from Jupiter were received around
midnight New Year’s Eve as predicted by George A. Dulk of the Univ. of Colorado. The signals were received at the Altitude Observatory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research at Boulder, which had kept its radiotelescope operating for the event. (Osmundsen, NYT, 1/2/65, 1)
January 2: NASA had compromised the scientific value of the interplanetary research program by spending too little on the Deep Space Net communications system, according to Frank Drake, prof, at Cornell Univ., in Saturday Review article. Drake noted that mariner iv would only be able to relay 22 photos of Mars back to earth and that these would be of lesser quality—all because of communications limitations: “. . . one concludes that the space program could well use an array containing a hundred or more 85-ft. antennas. One array might cost $40,000,000, still only a few per cent of what will almost certainly be spent on planetary exploration in the next ten years.” (SR, 1/2/65)
• Soviet cosmonaut Col. Vladimir Komarov, who commanded the three-
man spacecraft voskhod I on its orbital flight, told a Havana newspaper: “I believe I will take part in a similar trip—if not to the moon, then to another place.” Komarov was a member of the Soviet delegation in Havana for celebration of the sixth anniversary of Fidel Castro’s revolution. (New Orleans Times-Picayune, 1/3/65; ap, Hartford Courant, 1/3/65)
January 2: Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., received the first patent for a satellite communication system with its own orbit pattern. The satellite would linger for a considerable period over each of two widely separated areas; while hovering virtually stationary, it could relay television and radio programs within its range, and also store programs from one area to play later on the other side of the globe. (Jones, NYT, 1/2/65; Chic. Trib., 1/3/65)
•	U.K. was said to be considering the possibility of a licensing agreement
with the U.S. that would enable British manufacturers to make parts of late-model aircraft produced in the U.S. American planes under consideration were: McDonnell Aircraft Corp’s f4c (Phantom Ii) carrier-based attack aircraft; F-lll low-level strike aircraft made by General Dynamics Corp. and Grumman; and c-141 and Orion, both made by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (Farnsworth, NYT, 1/3/65, 13)
January 3: mariner iv changed the rate of sending scientific data from 33Vs to 8U; bits of information per second by an automatic switching operation. This was the first command initiated by the spacecraft itself since it performed its mid-course maneuver Dec. 5. mariner iv had traveled nearly 63 million miles in its 325-million-mile flight to Mars; the straight-line distance between earth and the spacecraft was 6,156,704 miles. Systems were operating normally after 36 days in space. (nasa Release 65-4)

•	Dr. Albert J. Kelley, Deputy Director of NASA Electronics Research
Center, said in an article in Boston Sunday Globe: “The need for increased electronics research to develop devices which will meet the demands and rigors of long space flights will affect our industrial outlook and economy in many ways. By requiring a ‘new look’ at electronics, NASA, led by ERC, will provide a research emphasis such as we have not had since World War II when the golden age of electronics started.
“We have been in the ‘rocket phase’ and are now entering the ‘electronic phase’ of space flight development, a phase which will affect us dramatically over many years.” (Boston Sun. Globe, 1/3/65)
•	British designers had perfected a miniature rocket costing only $2,240
per copy, it was reported. Nine ft. in length with a 7%-in. diameter, the rocket would use solid fuel and reach a speed of 3,500 mph, sending the casing containing scientific instruments to maximum altitude of 80 mi. plus, (ap, Kansas City Times, 1/4/65)
•	Scientists concluded that explosions and resultant earth-craters created
by giant meteorites bore a striking similarity to the effect produced by the larger nuclear weapons; hence a meteorite fall might be mistaken for a nuclear explosion. Opinions varied as to the size of the body that could gouge a crater as large as the Meteor Crater of Arizona—
anywhere from 30,000 tons to 2.6 million tons, with an explosive force of 20 million tons of tnt. Both the size of the meteorite and its velocity on impact would be factors in producing a crater. (Sullivan, NYT, 1/3/65, 6E)
January 3: Semyon A. Kosberg, 61, one of the Soviet Union’s leading designers of airplane engines, was killed in an automobile accident. He had been given the title “Hero of Socialist Labor” and had won a Lenin prize for his designs. {NYT, 1/5/65, 12)
• Writing in Pravda, I. Akulinichev, Dr. of Medical Sciences, said:
“. . . Of course, the question of lunar laboratories is now only at the level of scientific planning. ... To bring this possibility closer to our times, it is necessary to accomplish manned flights to the region of the Moon. Further, we need to solve reliably the question of methods to use for a successful lunar landing of a spacecraft and the return of the cosmonauts to Earth. In my view, the first lunar laboratories will initially study the possibilities of the prolonged sojourn of man on the Moon. Scientists will investigate ways of using the lunar conditions for assisting the normal life activity of people. . . . Finally, the scientists will study the conditions of orientation on the Moon and the possibilities of the navigation of interplanetary spacecraft.”
In the same issue of Pravda, Soviet Academician B. Konstantinov wrote: “In this New Year’s article, I wish to dwell on the possibility of international cooperation in the use of solar energy. . . . What appears most attractive is the conversion of solar energy into electricity. In the foreseeable future, man may solve this problem; along with this, it is conceivable that the problems of controlling the weather and climate will also be solved.” (Pravda, 1/3/65, 4, atss-t Trans.)
January 4: Gemini gt-3 spacecraft arrived at NASA Kennedy Space Center for final flight preparations before the nation’s first two-man flight this spring, (ksc Release 3-65)
•	According to Dr. Harold B. Finger, Manager of aec-nasa Space Nuclear
Propulsion Office (snpo), nasa would not spend any further funds on Project Orion (nuclear-pulse propulsion project). The decision was based on the fact that such a system could not be used while the nuclear test ban treaty was in effect. In addition, NASA felt there were more urgent projects on which to spend the money. (M&R, 1/4/65, 9)
•	Dr. Barry Commoner, professor of plant physiology at Washington Univ.
in St. Louis and chairman of the aaas Committee on Science in the Promotion of Human Welfare, told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the question of the probability of finding life on Mars had not been “fully and fairly aired,” and that an “overbalance of the positive viewpoint has been presented to Congress and the public by NASA officials.” Dr. Commoner said that if asked his views on Voyager as a tax-paying citizen, his feeling would be that “the value of pursuing a program to find life on Mars at this time is not worth the $1.25 billion to be invested because the problem of finding life there has not been adequately explored.” He had made similar charges in a speech at the aaas meeting last December in Montreal.
Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, was reported by Aviation Week and Space Technology as listing six major points in defending nasa’s position
regarding Mars exploration: (1) Numerous competent scientists had said there was little liquid water on Mars and that the planet had a dry, dusty surface with high ultraviolet radiation. Changing patterns on the planet indicated some form of seasonal change, however. (2) With the evidence at hand, it was not possible to say there was life on Mars, only that life might be there. (3) If there were life on Mars it might be similar to basic life forms on earth. (4) The only reasonable approach we could take to the exploration of Mars would be to make sure we looked for life before the planet was contaminated from earth. If life was not found on Mars, it still would be valuable to determine how far the planet’s chemical processes had progressed toward life formation. (5) The Voyager program had not been sold to Congress on the basis that there was life on Mars. It has been pointed out during budget hearings that there might not be life on the planet but nobody could responsibly take the position that there wasn’t. Therefore, the early emphasis of Project Voyager was on bioscience. (6) The Mars exploration was part of an overall program to explore the solar system, including the moon, comets, and other planets. Mars happened to be the planet NASA was focusing its attention on because it would be in the optimum launch position through the mid-1970’s. (Av. Wk., 1/4/65, 18)
January 4: Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, director of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the Univ. of Arizona and principal scientific investigator on the Ranger project, replied to Robert C. Cowen’s article, “Was the Ranger Worth the Cost?”, which appeared in the Christian Science Monitor Nov. 18. Mr. Co wen had raised four principal questions: (1) Was the recent ranger vii mission scientifically justifiable? (2) Was it well planned and executed? (3) Were the results up to expectations? (4) Where do we go from here? Dr. Kuiper said in letter to CSM: “Ranger was the U.S. pioneering program of deep-space research and accomplished much more than getting the 4,300 lunar photographs. It established the worth and feasibility of the ‘parking orbit’ and other concepts of space ballistics, power supply, and communication, as well as preparation for Mars and Venus probes. . . . The cost of the 4,300 lunar records is therefore not the full $270 million (which moreover includes Rangers viii and ix, not yet flown) but, say, $50-$100 million. No ground-based effort, even with the 300-400-inch telescope costing over $100 million, would, even in the absence of our disturbing atmosphere, have yielded 100th of the magnification (resolution) obtained in Ranger vii. I definitely know of no better and cheaper way to get high-resolution photographs. . . .”
In a reply to Dr. Kuiper, Mr. Cowen quoted from a letter by Dr. Andrew T. Young of Harvard College Observatory and published in Science: “. . . It is clear that there are some things that can only be learned above the atmosphere, and it is important that we have a program directed at learning them. . . . [But] many things that can be learned from above the atmosphere can also be learned, much more cheaply, by ground-based techniques. For example, some of the most convincing evidence for life on Mars is based on a few hours of twi-
light observations with the 200-inch telescope. . . . But the 200-inch telescope has been available for planetary research only a few times, generally during daylight or twilight. . . . Rocket-borne research involves many costly failures, but a duplicate 200-inch telescope could easily be built and staffed for the $28 million that Ranger 7 alone cost. . . .”	(CSM, 1/4/65)
January 4: Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (usaf) announced the activation of the Contract Management Div., Air Force Systems Command (afsc), under the command of Col. Fred L. Rennels, Jr. (usaf). Located at Los Angeles Air Force Station, the new division would be responsible for DOD contract management activities in those plants assigned to the Air Force under the dod National Plant Cognizance program, (afsc Release 61.64)

January 5: In a television interview, Israeli Premier Levi Eshkol urged West Germans to end the activity of German rocket experts in the United Arab Republic, said that these experts were helping the Arabs to prepare a war against Israel. The West German government had officially deplored the participation of German scientists and military experts in Arab rocket projects, but had not interfered on the grounds that the group was composed of private citizens who, according to the German Constitution, could work where they pleased. German rocket expert Prof. Wolfgang Pilz, leader of Germans working for the U.A.R., spoke in an interview of the pressure brought to bear by the Israeli Government, particularly the terrorist tactics of Israeli secret agents which made it necessary for Germans to be accompanied by body guards at all times.

January 6: NASA Nike-Apache sounding rocket reached a peak altitude of 91.1 mi. from Wallops Island, Va. Purpose was to simultaneously measure the altitude of sodium airglow with sodium vapor and interference filters and determine atmospheric density with a 26-in., metallized, inflated mylar sphere, (nasa Rpt. srl)
•	F-l 11a was flown successfully for the second time from Carswell AFB,
Tex. Flight data: maximum altitude, 27,000 ft.; maximum speed, 400 knots (460 mph) ; flight time, 1 hr. and 2 min. General Dynamics test pilots Richard L. Johnson and Val E. Prahl conducted stability and control tests at 10,000 and 20,000 ft., operating the wing sweep mechanism from 16° takeoff position to 26° position, then 43°, back to 40° to make sure the system worked, and finally to full-swept 72.5° position. This was the first time that wing position was varied in the flight of a military aircraft. The major test objective of the flight was accomplished—10 min. of flight with wings fully aft. Flight plans calling for an evaluation of stability at 30,000 ft. were called off because fuel flow and temperature in one of the two jet engines appeared to be outside normal limits, but this involved no reduction in flight time. General Dynamics reportedly would receive a bonus amounting to more than $800,000 for completing this milestone flight 24 days ahead of schedule. (Thomis, Chic. Trib., 1/7/65; Witkin, NYT, 1/7/65, 1; Av. Wk., 1/11/65, 19)
•	Air Force Secretary Eugene M. Zuckert placed further restrictions on
simulated bombing missions of b-58 Hustlers over Chicago: the supersonic bombers would fly at higher altitudes (48,000-49,000 ft. instead of 41,000-44,000-ft. range originally programed) to reduce impacts of sonic booms; flights would be canceled during bad weather. It had been announced earlier that the number of training missions per day would be reduced from a maximum of four to two. (Chic. Trib., 1/7/65)

•	Vice Adm. H. G. Rickover (usn) spoke before the Publishers’ Lunch
Club of New York. In his speech Admiral Rickover said: “How to resolve the antithesis between technology and individual liberty; how to insure that technology will be beneficial, not harmful, to man, to society, and to our democratic institutions—this, I would say, is a public question. I raise it here because I believe the members of this audience are particularly well qualified to explore this problem. In your business the conflict between technology and liberty —so prevalent everywhere else in our society—is muted, if not absent altogether.
“Improvements in the mechanics of producing and selling books have not diminished the importance of the author. Your success still depends on	him. He cannot be rendered	obsolete by
automation. The human factor therefore continues to outweigh the technical. As in the past, your main function is to discover talent and help bring it to fruition. You know that liberty enhances creativity,
that men with a special competence must be allowed to follow their own judgment. . . .
“How to make technology most useful to ourselves and our society, yet prevent it from controlling our lives—that is the problem. The problem is aggravated by the bureau-cratization of American life, itself largely a result of technology.” . (Text, CR, 1/29/65, 1522-24)

•	Dr. Richard Shorthill of Boeing Scientific Research Laboratories report-
ed that from 400 to 800 “hot spots” were observed on the moon during the eclipse of December 18, 1964. The lunar face had been scanned at infrared wavelengths from the Helwan Observatory near Cairo, Egypt. Recent impacts from meteors, which would create rocky craters slower to cool after the sunlight was obscured, might account for the “hot spots.” It was already known that prominent craters from which rays radiated in all directions, such as Tycho, were slow to cool, compared to the normal surface, which was thought to be carpeted with dust. While the total number of slow-cooling locations would remain uncertain until the tape-recorded results had been plotted by computer, Dr. Shorthill felt that if the technique produced an inventory of young craters, it would help in spotting new ones when they occurred and in estimating the rate at which the moon and the earth were bombarded by debris from space. (Sullivan, NYT, 1/9/65)
•	Application for patents on a recoverable single-stage spacecraft booster
was filed with the U.S. Patent Office by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.

•	Working on the assumption that a leveling off of defense expenditures in
the Federal budget would be accompanied by diversion of some defense funds for other public needs, California was taking steps to find new customers for its aerospace industries. 37 per cent of California’s manufacturing industry was concentrated in ordnance, aircraft, electrical, and instrument production, all of which, according to Gov. Edmund G. Brown, would be vulnerable to cutbacks and phaseouts in the Government’s space and defense programs. The state was prepared to finance study contracts in four major problem areas: waste management, data collection, care of the mentally and criminally ill, and transportation systems. Aerojet-General Corp. had already signed a six-month, $100,000 contract to develop long-range state plans to manage all kinds of waste, including air and water pollution. (Davies, NYT, 1/10/65, 12)

January 10: In an article entitled “The Pentagon, the ‘Madmen,’ and the Moon,” Maj. Gen. of the Soviet Air Force B. Teplinskiy said: “Sober voices in the United States call for collaboration with the U.S.S.R. in space research. The Saturday Evening Post said: ‘When we reach the moon and the stars, we shall find the solutions to the most profound secrets of the universe. How much more easily accessible all this would be if we would fly there together.’
“It is known throughout the entire world that the lag in this respect does not depend on the Soviet Union. It is the spiteful policy of those U.S. circles, which do not hide their military space plans, which constitute the obstacle. These plans are widely trumpeted by the press, television, and radio. Such a position is not accidental. On the one hand it allegedly pursues the aim of enhancing U.S. prestige while it actually is aimed at blowing up the psychosis around the space armaments race and at trying to provoke the Soviet Union into retalatory measures or to intimidate it by the alleged U.S. possibilities. A naive scheme.” (Krasnaya Zvezda, 1/10/65, 3)
•	Data from SOLRAD, the Naval Research Laboratory’s satellite monitoring
the sun’s x-ray behavior during the 1964--65 International Years of the Quiet Sun (iqsy), indicated that the sun was at its quietest during May, June, and July, 1964. Information from SOLRAD also suggested that the x-ray region of the corona, instead of being a homogeneous region of a million miles or so, was a series of small cells that flared up to emit hard x-rays and then decayed rapidly. What was seen on earth was the net effect of many knots of very hot, flashing gas giving the appearance of a homogeneous region. (Simons, Wash. Post, 1/11/65; Hines, Wash. Eve.

•	Eight NASA astronauts began geology field training in Hawaii, where they
visited lava fields of Mauna Loa and Kilauea, active volcanoes, as well as upper elevations of dormant Mauna Kea. Geologists believed that these shield volcanoes contained features similar to those of the lunar surface.
Study emphasis was on mechanics of lava flow, fissure eruption, deep lava lakes; examples of hot and cold basaltic flows; physical composition of lava rock; and topographic forms of shield volcanoes. Underfoot textures theorized as being typical of lunar terrain ranged from the glassy form of “pahoehoe” lava, through the crusty snow effect of “aa” lava, to the sinking feeling of loose cinders and pumice.
The study was conducted by Dr. Ted Foss, head of the Geology and Geochemistry Section at nasa Manned Spacecraft Center. Astronauts were Charles Conrad, Jr., Clifton C. Williams, David R. Scott, Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., Alan L. Bean, Donn F. Eisele, Roger Chaffee, and Richard Gordon, (upi, Houston Chron., 1/11/65; Bryan, Houston Post, 1/14/65)
•	U.S. Chamber of Commerce released a report entitled “Criteria for Fed-
eral Support of Research and Development,” which proposed the establishment of a forum for debating scientific and technical issues (such as space exploration and desalting of the oceans) before they became national policy. The council, to be composed of representatives of industry, labor, the Government, and the academic industry, would investigate the inherent worth of proposed programs and their
value to society to increase public understanding of issues that were usually decided by the Government alone and debated afterward. (Clark, NYT, 1/11/65, 46)
January 11: Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, said before the New York Academy of Sciences that “scientists should not set themselves up to judge the overall value” of the national space program. Past advice from scientists had not always been sound advice, he noted. “. . . Organized science has not always been outstanding for its courage, its vision, or its optimism regarding goals for human efforts. Elements of conservatism, parochialism, and even reactionary thinking do appear among scientists just as they do among many other groups in our society.”
Dr. Welsh was also critical of the practice of criticizing the space program “by narrowly comparing” the dollars spent for space with what those same dollars might accomplish “if devoted to other endeavors, scientific or otherwise.” He said that often such dollars were not transferable; that space dollars might change the general climate to one favoring broader aid to the whole spectrum of science; and that since space expenditures sought broader goals than those of science, “the comparison may well be invalid on the face of it.”
He continued: “The visionaries, whether primarily scientists or policy makers, must be given the opportunity to point out the many benefits which can flow from the manned and unmanned uses of aerospace. But, given such opportunity, they should use it effectively and affirmatively. Regardless of their motivations, the pessimists who cry out against aerospace research and technological endeavors have clearly set themselves against progress. The United States can no longer relax and rest on its past industrial laurels. The race for survival, literally and philosophically, is on. Of course, we would all like to believe in the solely non-aggressive uses of aerospace by all countries which have the needed technology. However, the realities of life dictate adequate preparation to preserve our national and Free World security. We should follow the axiom that a pound of prevention is worth mega-tons of cure.”
Howard Simons commented in the Washington Post that these remarks were probably precipitated by a report from a committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science which had charged that social, economic, military, and political pressures were distorting the traditional values and effectiveness of science. The report was highly critical of Project Apollo: “The Apollo program, in its present form, does not appear to be based on the orderly, systematic extension of basic scientific investigation.” (Text, CR, 1/28/65, A36T-65; Simons, Wash.

• NASA announced that Launch Complex 16 at Cape Kennedy would be modified to convert the former Titan missile facility into static test stands for the Apollo' manned lunar spacecraft. Construction bids were expected to be opened by Army Corps of Engineers, late this month. The modified test facility would replace an Apollo static test stand originally planned for the NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Merritt Island facility. Officials estimated that the modification of Complex
16 would represent a cost reduction of about 72 per cent under the original $7 million construction estimate for test stands on Merritt Island, (ksc Release 7-65)
January 11: nasa Langley Research Center scientist Windsor L. Sherman proposed conversion of Project Mercury spacecraft into unmanned, recoverable orbiting telescope platforms. Equipment would include a 76-cm. Cassegrainian telescope, a camera recording system, and an attitude control system. The system would weigh approximately 4,700 lb. and would be aimed for a 300-mi. orbit. The observatory would remain in orbit 100-200 days, exposing four frames of film on each orbit for a total of 6,000 frames. After all film was exposed, the system would be braked out of orbit and would descend into the Bermuda recovery area of the Eastern Test Range, using the same recovery techniques developed for the manned Mercury landings. In addition to its capacity to perform a variety of such astronomical observations as high resolution photography, photometry, and spectroscopy, Sherman said, the recoverable observatory would permit reuse of capsule, optical, and control systems. It would allow study of space effects on equipment, and the system could serve as a test bed for advanced orbiting telescopes. (Av. Wk., 1/11/65, 23)
• Dr. John J.

Dr. Brennan said the City of Cambridge’s claim that the renewal project would cost the Federal government $15 million was way off. He said costs would be between $40 million and $50 million. In a letter to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and the House and Senate space committees, Brennan stated: “We are taking every proper course of action, legal and otherwise, to stop this senseless destruction. . . .We do not believe that the overall destruction will bear judicial scrutiny.”
Paul Frank, director of the Cambridge Urban Redevelopment Authority, said Brennan’s figures were inaccurate and that the $40-$50 million figure was wrong. He claimed the overall cost would bring it down to $14,500,000. Of this figure, the Federal government cost would be $9,600,000 with the remaining $4,900,000 paid by the City of Cambridge, he asserted. (Boston Globe, 1/11/65)

January 12: Kiwi-TNT (Transient Nuclear Test) was successfully completed at Jackass Flats, Nev. This was a safety test to verify predictions of behavior of graphite nuclear reactor during a maximum power excursion. Using data from the test scientists would establish safety standards, particularly for launching nuclear-powered rockets. Nuclear energy released in the test was well within the designated maximum of nuclear test ban treaty of 1963. Preliminary test results indicated: (1) from V>-mi. to 50-mi. downwind from the test site, radiation did not approach accepted danger levels; (2) lethal radiation was confined to 200-to-300-ft. radius of the site, and beyond 500-to-600-ft. radius “a person would probably have survived unhurt unless struck by a piece of debris”; (3) pre-test predictions of the reactor’s behavior were accurate; and (4) cleaning up radioactivity at the site was easier than expected.

•	USN announced the Transit navigational satellite system was opera-
tional and had been in use since July 1964. The three gravity-gradient-stabilized satellites, weighing between 110 and 160 lbs. each, were launched on Thor-Able-Star boosters into near-circular 600-mi. polar orbits from Pt. Mugu, Calif. Operational lifetime of the satellites was expected to be about two years. The satellites emitted radio
signals which ships used to determine their positions, and could provide ships with navigational fixes—accurate to 0.1 mi.—about every 90 min. The shipboard computer operated automatically, beginning when the satellite approached, receiving the data, computing the ship’s position, and typing the results for the navigator. A number of fleet units were reported to be using the system. Capt. F. H. Price, Jr. (usn), who tested the system from the nuclear-powered cruiser U.S.S. Long Beach, called the system “the most reliable means of providing navigational information” and said it met the requirement of an “accurate, dependable, worldwide, all-weather, 24-hour-a-day capability.” This was the first continuous use of space technology in direct support of the fleet. It was predicted, but not officially confirmed, that the Polaris missile-firing submarines would adopt the navigational satellite system. NASA was studying commercial applications of a navigational satellite system and considering the possibility of developing its own system if it proved economically feasible, (dod Release 16-65; ap, Chic.

•	NASA Langley Research Center scientists Harry W. Carlson and Francis
E. McLean said that for the first time there was hope for a significant reduction in the sonic booms expected from proposed supersonic airliners. A plane flying faster than the speed of sound compresses the air around it into shock waves trailing from the nose, wings, engine inlets, tail, and any other protuberances. Near the plane there would be separate waves, producing “near field effects.” Traced on a graph to show changes in pressure, the waves would make a jagged line resembling the letter “N.” As the waves traveled toward the ground, they would coalesce into two powerful waves—one appearing to trail from the nose and one from the tail—producing “far-field effects” also shaped as a letter “N” in terms of pressure patterns. The sharp peaks of this N-shaped wave were suspected of causing most of the
annoyance and structural damage possible from sonic booms. Carlson and McLean discovered that planes the length and shape of supersonic airliner designs would not fly far enough away from the earth for their far-field effects to be felt on the ground, leaving only the less bothersome near-field effect to be taken into account.
It was hoped that this new finding would mean that designs currently submitted to the Government in the design competition for supersonic transport, or minor refinements of them, would fit within Government-imposed sonic boom limitations and that still further improvement through design changes would bring further decreases in the boom.
Dr. Floyd L. Thompson, LaRC Director, called what had been learned “significant new knowledge” and said it could, under the best of circumstances, “have great significance.” He pointed out that the best of circumstances were seldom found in designing an airplane— particularly the supersonic transport, which he said was “at least as sophisticated technically as the Apollo.” (Clark, NYT, 1/14/65, 1, 12)

• Dr. John C. Evvard, Deputy Associate Director for Research at NASA Lewis Research Center, discussed possible propulsion systems for future space-flight beyond the moon before the Conference on Civilian and Military Uses of Aerospace sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences. He cited a manned Mars project as a prime example of a mission that could be performed by a number of different propulsion concepts. For example, manned trips by chemical rockets would be weight-restricted, but chemical rocket systems would have the advantage of having been extensively flight-tested on many other missions. Although the reactor for planned nuclear propulsion systems had only been ground tested, evaluations of complete nuclear rocket engine systems were expected within the next few years. Electric propulsion systems for manned spaceflight were even further in the future and might not be ready by 1980; but by then the mission capability of the nuclear rocket would have been so thoroughly demonstrated that it would be more attractive than chemical engines for those missions requiring increased propulsion capability. Even further into the future were nuclear systems such as the gaseous-corecavity reactor which would yield higher performance, (lrc Release 65-5)

Halaby following the fatal in-flight explosion that occurred in a jet airliner December 8, 1963, near Elkton, Md. The aircraft was carrying a mixture of JP-4 and kerosene when it exploded in a lightning storm, giving rise to the question of the relative safety of the two fuels including the effects of mixing the two. Consensus of the group was that the airlines should continue their policy of being individually responsible for selecting fuels and for safety practices associated with handling such fuels. Another conclusion was that aircraft safety depended less upon the particular type of fuel used than upon equipment design and proper fueling techniques, (faa Release 65-9)

“To name some specifics, a new high-strength, lightweight material —formed from boron fibers and a plastic binder—would make possible great weight savings in aircraft and space vehicle structures with no sacrifice of either strength or stiffness. We have already produced laboratory samples of this boron composite. It is potentially as strong as the high-strength steels, structurally rigid, and as light as magnesium. It may have higher temperature capabilities than aluminum and magnesium, should be easy to fabricate, and should have a high resistance to corrosion.
“Another advance in the materials area is the use of oxide-dispersed metals in aircraft engines to provide strength at high temperatures. This development will make possible a substantial increase in the operating temperature of turbojet engines, which in turn will make for greater operating efficiency and improved thrust-to-weight ratios.” (Text, afsc Release)
January 17: Robert L. Sohn, scientist at Space Technology Laboratories, proposed to use the gravity field of Venus as a brake for manned spacecraft returning from Mars.
“We don’t expect to have boosters powerful enough to launch spacecraft of the 1970s that can carry extra propulsion to brake reentry speeds. . . . The landing corridor will be so narrow that a small fractional error in navigation would send the spacecraft into an eternal orbit around the sun.” He said traveling near Venus on the return journey from Mars would slow a spacecraft as it passed through the Venutian gravity field. Then, with some midcourse maneuvering and navigation, the astronaut could return to earth and reenter earth’s atmosphere with greater margin of error. (Macomber, San Diego Union, 1/17/65)
• Dr. I. M. Levitt, Director of the Fels Planetarium, said in the Philadelphia Inquirer: “As of this moment, the Soviets have tentatively determined that the maximum ‘safe’ period of weightlessness is 24 hr. They hold that after this period, ‘irreversible physiological changes begin to occur in the human system which, if not corrected, will eventually lead to death’. . . .
“The Soviets have also discovered a correlation between high accelerations and weightlessness. They believe that when an astronaut is subjected to high accelerations on launch he tends to overestimate or to overcompensate for his movements. Once the astronaut is weightless, then a radical reversal takes place in which the astronaut undercompensates and may suffer disorientation. . . .

developments in strategic weapon systems slated to begin this year:
“A new missile system, the Poseidon [new name for Polaris B—3], to increase the striking power of our missile-carrying nuclear submarines. The Poseidon missile will have double the payload of the highly successful Polaris a-3. The increased accuracy and flexibility of the Poseidon will permit its use effectively against a broader range of penetration of enemy defenses.
“A new Short Range Attack Missile (sram) that can, if needed, be deployed operationally with the b-52 or other bombers. This aerodynamic missile—a vast improvement over existing systems—would permit the bomber to attack a far larger number of targets and to do so from beyond the range of their local defenses.
“A series of remarkable new payloads for strategic missiles. These include: penetration aids, to assure that the missile reaches its target through any defense; guidance and re-entry vehicle designs, to increase many-fold the effectiveness of our missiles against various kinds of targets; and methods of reporting the arrival of our missiles on target, up to and even including the time of explosion.”
In addition, he said that development of the C-5A (formerly the cx) cargo transport and procurement of the Air Force F-lll fighter-bomber and new a-7 Navy attack aircraft would begin.
Finally, regarding the role of science and technology in the Nation’s security, the President said:
“We are currently investing more than $6 billion per year for military research and development. . . . About $2 billion a year of this program is invested in innovations in technology and in experimental programs. Thus, we provide full play for the ingenuity and inventiveness of the best scientific and technical talent in our Nation and the Free World.

•	Alfred Gessow, Chief of Fluid Physics Research, nasa, discussed before
the Compressed Gas Association in New York City the problems of spacecraft deceleration and heating involved in return through the earth’s atmosphere. He explained why the blunt shape solved deceleration and much of the heat problem in returning Mercury spacecraft from orbit through the atmosphere to earth. Looking beyond the satellite return speed (Mercury and Gemini) and lunar return speed (Apollo), return from interplanetary flight poses the problem of much higher spacecraft speed (and thus heating). Research indicates “that the more pointed shape, although it doesn’t show up too well at the lower re-entry speeds, is better than the blunt nose at the higher speeds because the bow shock is weaker, thus producing lower radiant heating losses. Thus, in a very short time scale, but taking a big leap forward in the velocity-temperature scale, we find ourselves going into another phase of the blunt vs. pointed nose cycle.
“. . . The switching between slender and blunt shapes is not new in the race for higher speeds at all times of history. Going through history, compact rocks were replaced by slender arrows; the concept of powder guns created round cannonballs; the rocket age produced slender forms again, which ironically, finally got blunt noses. It is interesting to see how long it took to make such changes empirically and how rapidly these variations have been made by following scientific principles. . . .” (Text)

January 19: An unmanned instrument-packed Gemini spacecraft (gt-2) was launched from Cape Kennedy on Titan II launch vehicle in suborbital shot preliminary to U.S.’s first two-man venture. Aboard was an automatic sequencer which issued orders at precise times en route to fire the rocket’s second stage, to separate the spacecraft from the rock-
et, to jettison the spacecraft’s storage section, to cartwheel the spacecraft into a reentry attitude, and to open the spacecraft’s parachutes.
The rocket reached a maximum altitude of 98.9 mi. and a speed of 16,708.9 mph before impacting 2,127.1 mi. downrange. The Gemini spacecraft descended by parachute into the Atlantic 16 mi. short of the planned impact point and 52 mi. from the carrier U.S.S. Lake Champlain which recovered the capsule an hour and 45 min. after launch. The capsule was reported in excellent condition.
Major experiments for which the test was intended were apparently complete successes: a test of the heat shield; a test of the retrorocket system; and a test of the sequencing system.
Despite its successes, the test had some difficulties: a fuel cell that would be the primary electrical system in the spacecraft during long-duration manned flights failed to operate before launching because of a stuck valve; the temperature was found to be too high in the cooling system of the spacecraft, (nasa Release 64—296; MSC Roundup, 1/3/65, 1; Wash.

January 19: Dr. Burton I. Edelson, staff member of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, spoke on communications satellites at the aiaa meeting in Las Cruces, N.Mex. He said: “There is a general growing interdependence of politics, economics, and technology, and in no area do these forces interact more noticeably, than in international communications. When we try to predict the course that communications satellites systems will follow in the years to come we must consider not only decibels and megacycles, rocket thrusts and orbital elements, but the competitive economic pressure of transoceanic cables and the political aspirations of developing nations. . . .
“Finally, I believe the words of Arthur Clarke, the visionary who first conceived of the communications satellite, will be fulfilled: ‘Com-sats will end ages of isolation making us all members of a single family, teaching us to read and speak, however imperfectly, a single language. Thanks to some electronic gear twenty thousand miles above the equator, ours will be the last century of the savage.’ ” (Text)
January 20: President Lyndon B. Johnson was inaugurated. In his Inaugural Address, he said:
“For every generation, there is a destiny. For some, history decides. For this generation, the choice must be our own.
“Even now, a rocket moves toward Mars. It reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children, or even for ourselves in a short span of years. The next man to stand here will look out on a scene different from our own.
“Ours is a time of change—rapid and fantastic change—baring the secrets of nature—multiplying the nations—placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction—shaking old values and uprooting old ways. . . .
“Change has brought new meaning to that old mission. We can never again stand aside, prideful in isolation. Dangers and troubles we once called ‘foreign’ now live among us. If American lives must end, and American treasure be spilled, in countries we barely know, that is the price that change has demanded of conviction.
“Think of our world as it looks from that rocket heading toward Mars.
“It is like a child’s globe, hanging in space, the continents stuck to its side like colored maps. We are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth. And each of us, in the span of time, has only a moment among his companions.
“How incredible it is that in this fragile existence we should hate and destroy one another. There are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature. There is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way.
“Our own course is clear. We aspire to nothing that belongs to others. We seek no dominion over our fellow man, but man’s dominion over tyranny and misery. . . .” (Text)

January 22: NASA’s TIROS IX successfully injected into a polar orbit by a three-stage Delta rocket launched from Cape Kennedy. The spacecraft was to have gone into a circular orbit about 460 mi. above the earth but the second stage of Delta burned 11 sec. too long and pushed TIROS IX into an elliptical orbit with apogee 1,602 mi., perigee 426 mi., inclination 81.6°, and period 119 min. First NASA attempt to place a satellite in near-polar sun-synchronous orbit from Cape Kennedy involved three dog-leg maneuvers. In a sun-synchronous orbit the precession (westward drift) of the satellite would be about 1° daily, the same rate and direction as the earth moves around the sun.
A hat-box shaped structure, TIROS IX was an 18-sided polygon, 22in. high, 42-in. in dia., weighing 305 lbs., with one of its flat sides facing earth when initially injected into orbit. Ground signals to the control system tipped the craft up 90° so that it assumed the appearance of a fat wheel rolling on a track around the earth.

January 25: President Johnson sent FY 1966 Budget Request to Congress, recommending a total space budget of $7,114 billion. Of this sum, NASA would receive $5.26 billion, DOD $1.6 billion, AEC $236 million, Weather Bureau $33 million, and National Science Foundation $3 million.
The NASA request provided for initiation of a major new project— Project Voyager, budgeted at $43 million—and intensive study of Apollo-X, with funding of $50 million. Hardware development funds were requested for the Advanced Orbiting Solar Observatory ($25.1 million), and the Radio Astronomy Explorer Satellite. Advanced research was reduced by cancellation of development of the 260-in.-dia. solid-fuel rocket motor, the M-l liquid-hydrogen engine (1.2-million-lb.-thrust), and Snap-8 nuclear electric power unit.
nasa Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., labeled the budget an austere one, but said the chances of landing a man on the moon by 1970 were still good. In discussing the new programs, Dr. Seamans said the requested $43 million for Voyager would be spent on project definition of the spacecraft bus and landing capsule to explore Mars in the next decade. This funding would also enable NASA to make a Martian fly-by in 1969 to test the spacecraft and launch vehicle prior to the 1971 and 1973 missions.
Major portions of the DOD space budget were alloted for the following: (1) pre-program definition phase of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol) ; (2) accelerated research on reentry and recovery of spacecraft; (3) continued development of the Titan in space booster;
(4)	development of the Defense Communications Satellite System.
Two thirds of aec’s budget request was earmarked for development of nuclear rocket propulsion and nuclear power sources for space applications. The nuclear propulsion program, Project Rover, was alloted $84.1 million; the nuclear power source program, Snap, $70.5 million; and advanced projects applicable to space, $12 million. The Pluto reactor program was not included in the budget request.
The Weather Bureau would start its investment in an advanced weather satellite system in fy 66 with a $500,000 request for sensors and subsystem studies in conjunction with NASA studies. Funds for three Tiros Operational System (Tos) satellites and four Delta launch vehicles to be delivered in two years, $21.6 million, were included in the budget request. Most of the rest was requested for the National Weather Satellite Center (nwsc) and would be spent to convert the present Tiros command and data acquisition facilities to full-time, operational centers run solely by the Weather Bureau.
President Johnson asked Congress for $650 million as a White House contingency fund to meet the possible need to accelerate supersonic transport development. (Text, M&R, 2/1/65, 10—17; Text, NYT, 1/26/65. 26-28; Av. Wk., 2/1/65, 16-17; nasa Budget Briefing fy 1966)
January 25: President’s message sending budget for Fiscal Year 1966 included the following remarks: “Space research and technology: This Nation has embarked on a bold program of space exploration and research which holds promise of rich rewards in many fields of American life. Our boldness is clearly indicated by the broad scope of our program and by our intent to send men to the moon within this decade.
“The costs are high—as we knew they would be when we launched this effort. We have seen a rise in annual expenditures for the space program from less than one-half billion dollars in 1960 to over $4 billion in 1964.
“Expenditures are continuing to increase. However, we have built up momentum and are concentrating on our highest priority goals. Therefore, we will no longer need to increase space out-lays by huge sums each year in order to meet our present objectives.
“This budget proposes that expenditures increase by $22 million in 1966 over 1965. This is the smallest annual increase since 1959. The new obligational authority requested is about the same as enacted for 1965.” (nasa lar iv/16)
January 25: NASA Administrator James E. Webb and DOD Secretary Robert S. McNamara announced NASA—dod agreement on the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol), released in conjunction with fy 1966 budget: “. . . Planning for the Defense manned orbiting laboratory program will also consider, in cooperation with nasa, broader objectives of scientific and general technological significance.
“To determine the essential characteristics of the vehicle that will be required, the DOD will continue intensive studies and design of experiments and systems aimed at the primary military objectives.
“Cooperative studies, by nasa and Defense, will identify and define scientific and general technological experiments which might be carried out, with NASA participation, in conjunction with the military program.
“dod, with assistance from NASA, will compare configurations of Apollo which may be suitable for military experiments with the Gemini b-mol configuration to determine the complete system that can meet the primary military objectives in a more efficient, less costly, or more timely fashion.
“On the basis of these studies, a decision will be made whether to proceed with full-scale development by Defense of a manned orbiting laboratory system and what the specific developments and vehicle configurations are to be. The Defense budget includes $150 million in fy 1966 for the program. . . .
“Depending upon the manned orbiting laboratory decision, upon the progress in the Gemini and Apollo programs, and upon the results of nasa studies, a decision will be made whether to proceed with modifications to the Apollo system and the nature and timing of necessary specific developments. The NASA 1966 budget includes about $50 million for proceeding with design and pacing developments. . . .” (nasa Budget Briefing fy 1966)
• NASA Associate Administrator Dr. Robert Seamans said during FY 1966 budget briefing: “. . . it is conceivable . . . that the lunar landing would occur in early 1970 ... we feel actually greatly encouraged at the progress that has been made freezing the design, and we feel very reassured at the test results we are achieving on our propulsion systems and with our stages. So that we really feel that there is more chance that we can get off the flight on an earlier mission than I would have said a year ago.”
Dr. Seamans said Apollo gave the nation a capability for a wide variety of scientific and technological flights in earth orbit, in orbit around the moon, and also for an extended lunar stay time. He commented that the objectives of the current extended Apollo (Apollo-X) design and feasibility studies were to extend the time of the lunar mission out to the order of two weeks. He also said that Apollo-X circumlunar flights, in polar orbit about the moon and taking photographs of the entire lunar surface, on missions that could involve staytimes on the moon of up to one or two weeks, all would have great possibility and would offer great interest scientifically. In commenting on an earlier agreement (1963) with the Pentagon for developing of a manned orbiting laboratory, Dr. Seamans said: “At the time of
that agreement, we were really thinking of something that we now realize is further out in time, namely, a more permanent space station that could stay in orbit for a year’s time and could be resupplied, and would permit the crew to be ferried into orbit and bring them back. The study really related to that kind of possibility which we now realize is much further out in time ... we may end up with what is called the MOL, and we may also find that there are important uses for the Apollo system beyond the present manned lunar landing program.”
He said NASA studies of improving both the Saturn IB and the Saturn V launch vehicles indicated that “these two launch vehicles can take care of our needs for an extended period of time.” (NASA Budget Briefing FY 1966)
January 25: NASA announced two Radio Astronomy Explorer satellites (rae-a and rae-b) would be designed to investigate low-frequency (long wavelength) emissions from our galaxy, its planets, and the stars. These emissions are mostly intercepted by the ionosphere so that little can be learned about them from ground-based receivers. This would be the first attempt to map the galaxy for low-frequency emissions. The 280-lb. spacecraft would be launched by Thrust-Augmented Delta into circular orbits at altitudes of about 3,700 mi. and would measure the intensity of the signals, their frequency, times of emission and, within limitations, define the regions of space in which they originated. Proposed designs called for the development of two 750-ft., V-shaped antennas that would be mounted opposite each other, forming a giant X. They would be anchored to the basic spacecraft, a cylinder of about 40-by-40 in., capped by two truncated cones. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center would design, integrate, and test the two spacecraft. First launch was not expected before 1967. (nasa Release 65-20)

NASA Administrator James E. Webb. Mr. Webb said in a speech there:
“. . . space science and technology are not remote and esoteric pursuits but rather are deeply woven into the fabric of our society. The space scientist does not practice a new art. He is an astronomer, a physicist, a chemist, a geologist, rooted in our university system of vigorous effort to expand our knowledge of the universe in which we live. The space technologist is an engineer of materials, structures, fuels, power sources, electronics, rooted in our industrial and government laboratory systems. Both, however, are directing their interests and talents to the newest and most exciting frontiers—where the most rapid progress is made and the breakthroughs scored. The knowledge they gain feeds back into our scientific and technical communities and into our industrial laboratories. . . . Thus, the talents, the skills, and the funds for space exploration are all drawn broadly from our
society and continue to feed back into it, in the forefront of scientific and technical progress—the unique hallmark of the American way.” (Text)

in the Congressional Record by Rep. Silvio Conte (R—Mass.). Based on interviews with German scientists just back from Egypt and with
West German defense ministry officials who debriefed them after their return, the article said: “Egypt’s missile program is considerably further advanced than is generally realized in the West.
“Some of these scientists who have returned to West Germany say that Nasser will have the missiles to devastate wide areas of Israel by late 1967 and that he will have rockets with a 1-ton payload by the end of 1965.
“West German defense ministry experts who have questioned the returning rocket scientists regard their assessment of Nasser’s rocket potential as entirely realistic and possibly too conservative.
“The scientists say Nasser has accelerated greatly his rocket program since the first test firing of four missiles on July 22, 1962.” (CR, 1/26/65, 1160)

•	In U.S. launch vehicles hearings before Senate Committee on Aeronauti-
cal and Space Sciences, NASA Administrator James E. Webb discussed recent study by the Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board’s Launch Vehicles Panel:
“In considering the merits of canceling certain vehicles in order to provide quantity production of the remaining vehicles, the Launch Vehicle Panel of the AACB evaluated several alternatives against a forecast of DOD’s and nasa’s needs over the next 10 years. This space-mission forecast served as a basis for determining the number of launch vehicles required and the cost of producing the various combinations of these launch vehicles.
“The result of the study is particularly interesting in that it shows a cost difference of less than 1 per cent among the alternative options. This difference is less than the accuracy of the data used in the analysis. The results indicate that any economies that might be realized by increased quantity production of boosters would be lost through cost of adapting specific mission spacecraft to a new vehicle where the costs of such work have already been incurred. . . .
“The major advantages of the recent comprehensive study . . . , as distinct from previous reviews, were the development of much improved methods for estimating the costs of launch vehicles considering the effects of quantity production, variety of vehicles, and inplant workload; the use of an inclusive or overall forecast as a basis for determination of both DOD and NASA space missions against which total launch vehicles costs could be calculated; and the value of the results of the study to NASA to confirm our judgment on the use of the SATURN i-b for the apollo and voyager missions.
“. . . we are making extensive use of DOD-developed launch vehicles and will continue to do so for some time to come. However, a wider variety of first-stage boosters and upper stages is required by NASA space missions than by those of the DOD. We have requirements for a wider range of variety of size, payload, and velocity for our missions. We have been carefully investigating our future vehicle needs; optimum vehicle configurations; and the most promising advanced propulsion methods to be sure that our program will provide the options that the country will need in making decisions to undertake future missions.
“. . . we are utilizing the channels and procedures established by the DOD—NASA launch vehicle agreement and by the AACB to coordinate the needs and activities of NASA and the DOD to assure the most effective national launch vehicle program. However, we are presenting to the Congress, in our budgets each year, the specific booster needs we have over and above those which can be met by DOD-developed systems. . . .”	(Hearings . . .

January 27: President Johnson sent to the House and Senate his message transmitting annual report on the U.S. space activities. In his letter, President Johnson said: “The advances of 1964 were gratifying and heartening omens of the gains and good to come from our determined national undertaking in exploring the frontiers of space. While this great enterprise is still young, we began during the year past to realize its potential in our life on earth. As this report notes, practical uses of the benefits of space technology were almost commonplace around the globe—warning us of gathering storms, guiding our ships at sea, assisting our mapmakers and serving, most valuably of all, to bring the peoples of many nations closer together in joint peaceful endeavors.
“Substantial strides have been made in a very brief span of time— and more are to come. We expect to explore the moon, not just visit it or photograph it. We plan to explore and chart planets as well. We shall expand our earth laboratories into space laboratories and extend our national strength into the space dimension.”
A hypersonic aircraft—one that could fly the Atlantic in less than an hour—had reached the stage where models were being constructed for wind tunnel tests. President Johnson’s report disclosed: “Two structural models embodying design concepts applicable to the fuselage of a hydrogen-fueled hypersonic aircraft were being constructed for testing at 1,500-2,500° F—temperatures likely to be encountered in hypersonic flight. Equipment was developed for inducing angular oscillations in the test section flow of a large transonic wind tunnel and will be used to obtain the dynamic response of wind tunnel models.” (CR, 1/27/65, 1366; U.S. News, 2/2/65)

•	Experiments at NASA Ames Research Center by Dr. John Young and Dr.
Cyril Ponnamperuma indicated that Mars may lie under a steady rain of edible sugars produced photochemically in the Martian atmosphere. It was speculated that the sugars and other compounds might drift to the Martian surface, seep into the soil, and form underground reservoirs of nutrients.
Results of tests for survival of 50 strains of earth bacteria in simulated Martian atmosphere indicated that the strains of bacteria which form hard spores and are thus most likely to survive space flight are most sensitive to the freeze-thaw extremes of temperature that prevail on Mars. Thus, while the bacteria might survive on Mars in spore form, they would not grow there and would not contaminate the planet. Other bacteria would die en route. (S.F. Chron., 1/28/65)
•	In U.S. launch vehicles hearings before Senate Committee on Aeronau-
tical and Space Sciences, Dr. Alexander Flax, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (r&d), said:
“In general, the joint DOB-NASA study [by the aacb] has shown that no drastic revisions to the national launch vehicle family are required to meet the mission demands that we can project for the immediate future and that further no drastic revisions can be justified on purely economic grounds. In addition, it is clear that the extensive effort on the part of both the DOD and the NASA in improving,
launch vehicle system reliability has been paying off, and that we can expect a continuing trend in this regard. However, it is important to also recognize some of the natural limitations inherent in any long-range projection of requirements such as we have had to make for this study period. There are a number of areas in which unforeseen increased mission capability demands could react on our launch vehicle performance requirements. We must, therefore, continually maintain effective exploratory and advanced development programs which will provide us with the technology to meet such demands in the future. . . .” (Hearings . . .

Then in 1958 the SST became a major engineering project and it has continued in that status ever since, involving many of our top engineers.
“From the start of our effort to the present, design determinations have come in an orderly and unhurried progression, as a result of the integration of mountains of test data, much of it worked out in close conjunction with NASA laboratories which, incidentally, deserve the sincere thanks of the American people for their pioneering work in this field.

January 27: Stellar objects dubbed “interlopers” had been discovered by the Mt. Wilson-Palomar Observatories in California. Dr. Allan R. Sandage of Mt. Wilson said an effort would be made to determine whether the new objects were a form of quasar. He said an alternative possibility was that the objects were a rare form of star system in which two stars lay so close to each other that the presence of one caused explosions on the surface of the other. The resulting strongly ultraviolet light would superficially resemble that of quasars. Dr. Sandage reported that so far about 45 quasars had been identified. The “interlopers,” so called because of their close resemblance to quasars, had been found at the rate of two to a square degree of sky in the limited region studied. So far, they totaled four.

Center told the American Meteorological Society that the Weather Bureau was developing a system in which buoys moored in the ocean would broadcast weather data to communications satellites that would rebroadcast it almost instantaneously to almost any point on earth.
Mr. Vaeth said the initial optimum number of buoys would be 300, spaced about 600 mi. apart in major ocean regions. They would be moored at known, fixed points and would send data on sea and air temperature, wind direction and velocity, and barometric pressure. Relays from the satellites would be by very-high-frequency radio and would be picked up on the ground by inexpensive receiving stations, aircraft, or ships at sea. .

January 29: Speaking on the Senate floor, Sen. Richard B. Russell (D-Ga.) said: “I am greatly disturbed that funds for the continuation of the large solid rocket engine program have been eliminated from the 1966 budget for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
“. . . I am concerned about the effect that the proposed termination of this program will have over our long-range space effort and upon the security of the country. For it will cut off, at a particularly inappropriate time, a crucial research and development program that already has shown significant potential for fulfilling future space booster needs—for both defense and nondefense purposes. This is particularly true for launching large payloads and missions into deep space that are contemplated in the not-so-distant future.
“The booster technology and capability that we are developing under the large solid rocket engine program could become a vital factor in preventing the Russians from achieving a position of dominance in space. . . .
“Indeed, the decision to terminate this program appears to be a direct contradiction of Mr. Webb’s own views, as expressed as recently as Tuesday of this week to the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. He said unequivocally that space missions contemplated for the next decade and beyond will require ‘new launch vehicles and new space vehicle developments.’ He said our experience with the Apollo moon program has shown that ‘a policy of support for the development of carefully selected advanced propulsion systems must be followed if we are to assure they will be available when needed.’
“It is highly inconsistent—to say the least—to speak boldly of exploring the moon, reaching and charting the planets, establishing manned stations in space, and extending our national strength into the space dimensions, while at the same time killing off one of the most promising programs for the achievement of these very goals. . . .” (CR, 1/29/65, 1535)

•	NASA Ames Research Center was conducting tests on a Douglas f5d
aircraft with a specially designed planform wing that might minimize landing speeds for the proposed supersonic transport. A tornado-like flow, called “vortex airflow,” and resulting from the sharp difference between the low pressure on the top of the wing and the high pressure on the underside, was generated along the leading edges of the “S”-shaped wing. Engineers said use of the sharply angled wings with tornado effect on top had these advantages: (1) the tornadoes affected air flow over the entire aircraft and eliminated turbulence that would make other aircraft directionally unstable when coming in nose high for a landing; (2) the tornadoes made it almost impossible for the wings to lose their lift completely. Also, it was felt this wing shape took maximum advantage of the cushioning effect produced in compressing air between the underside of the wings and the ground which would make it necessary to level off sharply at the last moment before touching down.
Existence of this tornado-like flow along the leading edges of the wing encouraged the belief that a supersonic airliner might be built without resorting to variable-sweep wings.

Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, England, believed that the U.S. communications satellite ECHO ii—launched Jan. 25, 1964, and still in orbit—had been pierced by its own launching canister shortly after injection into orbit.
According to The New Scientist, the shape of echo ii after launching was flabby and elongated rather than the perfect sphere wanted for some of its communication experiments.
Analysis of Malvern’s radar tracks on ECHO II revealed writhing echoes that, according to their theory, arose when the very short radar pulses entered a hole and rebounded from the aluminum-coated interior of the balloon. The Malvern team thought the balloon had a puncture about 18 in. long and 27 in. wide in one side.
NASA spokesmen said they did not believe echo II had been punctured by either its launching canister or its launching vehicle and that sightings from more than a dozen radar stations had contradicted the Malvern theory. They added that echo Il’s ability to reflect radio signals had not been seriously impaired and many messages had been bounced off in the last year. (Hillaby, NYT, 1/31/65, 29)

During January: Reviewing Apollo program progress, Dr. Joseph Shea, Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, said that NASA had characterized the program as a series of phases. He explained that 1963 and 1964 were years of detailed designs and initial developmental testing; 1964 and 1965 were years of extensive ground tests and qualifications for flight; from 1966 on, ground tests would be supplemental to extensive flight tests, initially on the Saturn IB and later on the Saturn V. From his visits to almost all of the major Apollo hardware contractors, Dr. Shea said he could report that all of the subsystems associated with the command and service modules “are well along in their ground test programs.
“Almost all elements are on schedule and the test results indicate that the designs will meet our program objectives. By early this year, all subsystem hardware will be undergoing the rigorous qualification tests which we require before certifying such hardware ready for flight. ... By the end of 1965, there will be three Apollo spacecraft in continuous ground testing. 1964 was, in retrospect, a year where milestone by milestone, we have achieved Apollo objectives.” (naa S&1D Skywriter, 1/15/65, 1, 4; Witkin, NYT, 1/24/65, 60)
•	Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
said in an article in Astronautics and Aeronautics for January:
“. . . With Ranger 7, the prime factor was the expectation that the Apollo mission would choose a landing area on one of the smooth ‘maria.’ So it was of great value to this program to find out as much as possible about the mare topography. In particular, it was necessary to know if these areas were really lava flows and, if so, how much was exposed lava and how densely the small craters were scattered over the surface.
“Ranger gave some of the answers. In some areas, at least, small craters were indeed strewn very thickly. Probably such areas lie
along the rays which radiate from some of the more recent large craters. Between these ray regions the surface of the mare appears to be quite smooth. No large rocks or fissures are apparent, although the general roughness may be comparable to some terrestrial lava fields where the lava is of the ‘pahoehoe,’ or fluid variety. However, the absence of any significant number of features showing edges with a small radius of curvature, and the presence of small craters which have been filled with debris, point to erosion as a significant modifier of the primeval lunar surface. This erosion could arise from meteoric bombardment and the effects of solar radiations. Estimates of the depth of surface which has been eroded away range from 5 to 50 ft. . . .”	(A&A, 1/65, 18-20)
During January: GAO charged that mismanagement of the Nimbus meteorological satellite project resulted in unnecessary costs of $1.2 million. The report claimed that Nimbus’ project manager at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center “did not effectively carry out his responsibility” for flight planning when it became evident that the spacecraft had become overweight and that he allowed the contractor to continue working toward the original design goal “even though it was clear [the effort] would be futile” because of booster limitations.
Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, rebutted the GAO allegations: “The costs which were incurred on the Nimbus project during the 5V2 months between May 1961 and November 20, 1961, were for the development of the fully redundant Nimbus system to satisfy the requirements of the Plan for a National Operational Meteorological Satellite System. . . . Our effort to achieve the redundant system in the first Nimbus flight was continued as long as possible. ... we did not want to take the step of dropping the redundant system, even for the first flight, until we were sure we had to.” (gao Nimbus Rpt., 1/65; M&R, 2/8/65,9)	_
• Writing in the January 1965 issue of Astronautics and Aeronautics, Dr. Harold B. Finger, Manager of aec—nasa Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (snpo) , summed up the various components of the advanced nuclear propulsion program and emphasized the importance of the solid-core nuclear rocket within the field: “Solid-core nuclear rockets are the best understood and most nearly developed of the many advanced nuclear-propulsion concepts being investigated in this country. They offer the most assured and earliest possible means for very substantial improvements and advances in space-flight propulsion capability. Furthermore, because solid-core nuclear rockets rely heavily on technology and techniques of chemical rocket engines and although much extension of these techniques is required, no fundamentally new engineering approaches are required to develop this new breed of substantially improved rocketry for actual flight use. Solid-core nuclear rockets can be relied on for our future space missions.
“Progress has been made in electric propulsion, particularly in the thruster area, and important research data and technology are also beginning to be provided in the difficult area of nuclear-reactor electric generating systems required for prime electric propulsion.
“Beyond these systems, other advanced nuclear propulsion concepts are not yet well-enough understood to justify undertaking significant development efforts.” (A&A, 1/65, 30-35)

•	In an article in the Indianapolis Star discussing Soviet medical practices
observed during his visit to Russia at the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Science, Dr. John M. Keshishian, associate in surgery on the George Washington University School of Medicine faculty, said: “It is not generally known that just before Voskhod was ordered into reentry, the pulse rate of one cosmonaut dropped to 40.
“When your pulse rate drops below 40 heartbeats a minute, you’re in trouble.
“The Russians haven’t said anything about this . . . but it could be another one of the problems their space medicine is encountering for which there seems to be no ready solutions.
“For example, some Russian cosmonauts have suffered severe, hallucinations, both in flight and afterwards. Others have suffered equally severe and, thus far, inexplicable vertigo during which they can’t be certain whether the floor’s coming up to meet them or vice versa, or whether they’re spinning, or the room is. And Russian physicians have found that . . . space flight environment—possibly weightlessness—draws calcium from the blood and expels it in the urine.” (World Book Encyclopedia Science Service, Inc., Keshishian, Indianapolis Star)
•	In an article in Foreign Affairs entitled “Slowdown in the Penta-
gon,” Hanson W. Baldwin said: “The sprawling bureaucracy of big government; the control of major military or paramilitary projects by agencies over which the Defense Department has no direct authority, including the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Bureau of the Budget; congressional legislation and executive regulation—social, political and economic; the tremendous size and complexity of the Armed Forces; overcentralization and overregulation in the Pentagon; too much service rivalry and not anough service competition—all these and other factors have become builtin roadblocks in defense development and contracting.
“The creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has provided another type of problem. NASA stemmed from the same kind of political philosophy that nurtured the AEC. Atom bombs were too powerful to allow the generals to play with them; ergo, a civilian agency must control nuclear power—and it must be channeled away from nasty military purposes. The same scientific-political pressure groups that advocated this concept helped (with President Eisenhower’s approval) to establish NASA, again on the theory that space efforts must be controlled by civilians and that space must not be used for military purposes. . . .
“But in the case of NASA, the problem has been compounded. For while the aec is essentially a research and production agency, NASA is an operating agency as well. From a small highly efficient aeronautical research agency, it has now expanded into a gargantuan multibil-lion-dollar empire, with tentacles all over the country, managing the biggest program on which the United States has ever embarked—to place a man on the moon.
“In its early years, NASA was sluggishly if at all responsive to military needs, and the Pentagon itself was inhibited from any effective space developments (though, curiously, the only effective space boosters available were military ballistic missiles). Gradually the liaison, due to Dr. [Edward C.] Welsh and others, has been greatly improved. Numerous military officers, active and retired, now hold some of the most important positions in NASA, and in addition the Armed Forces have furnished most of the astronauts and by far the most important part of the facilities and services used by the agency. The two-headed control still offers difficulties, but today the main stumbling blocks to the rapid development of military space projects are Secretary McNamara and his Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Dr. Harold Brown, who in his new political role in the Pentagon has become a remarkably unadventurous scientist.
“Often the President’s Scientific Adviser, whose contacts with Pentagon and other Government scientists cut squarely across organizational lines, has also acted as roadblock to new developments. He exercises tremendous power without either specific responsibility or specific authority; therefore, his intervention often not only delays but confuses. The Adviser’s great power stems largely from his White House status; unfortunately around him has grown up a small but important office manned by men more impressive as bureaucrats than as scientists, who represent, in effect, another echelon of delay. . . .” {Foreign Affairs, 1/65; CR, 2/4/65, 2007)

During January: Marvin L. White. AFCRL’s Space Physics Laboratory, predicted the sun was encircled by “rings” of electric current totaling nearly 200 billion amps. Although total current was high, White postulated that the current density was low because the current was spread over a large area; he predicted current density to be about three trillionths of an ampere per square centimeter, the same order of magnitude as in the earth’s atmosphere. White’s calculations were based on particle flux data from mariner ii. (oar Research Review, 1/65, 1-2)
With launch of two balloons to 87,000-ft. altitudes from Chico, Calif., AFCRL began one-year series of high-altitude balloon flights to measure moisture in the stratosphere.

In an article on detecting extraterrestrial life, William R. Corliss in International Science and Technology described some of the plans for collecting data on possible life-forms elsewhere and some of the factors making the search for extraterrestrial life so challenging. He noted the complications for Martian life-detection if retrorockets were necessary to brake the landing of a scientific package: “First, of course, they add weight to the landing package, right where it hurts the most. Also, their control adds complexity and increases the chance of failure. Finally and perhaps most importantly, they would make the problem of life-detection more difficult and any results more ambiguous; the rocket exhaust would tend both to fuse the surface of the landing area (maybe even killing any existing organisms), and to add combustion contaminants of its own in the most crucial area—around the lander.” He listed the variety of experimental instruments proposed for detecting extraterrestrial life (or clues of life) and explained why the dependability of these instruments—based on different physical and chemical principles—varied widely.

•	Discussing the missions and plans of nasa’s new Electronics Research
Center, Dr. Winston E.

I have seen at first hand true research enthusiasm at two NASA Research Centers, Lewis in Cleveland, and Ames in California, and, at Cambridge’s new nasa Research Center, the response we have had from inventive, research-minded individuals, expressing an in-
terest in association with the Center has been phenomenal. I have always believed in the saying ‘necessity is the mother of invention,’ and I feel certain that it was the necessities of World War II that brought into bloom radar, the jet aircraft, nuclear power, the v-2 rocket (which led to our present missile and space rockets), and many other developments which have proved to be of vital importance to our way of life. So, I feel that a counterbalance to today’s reduced necessities of the broad, new opening field of space research . . . will help to keep our nation’s research talent active and enthusiastic, and maintain it in the strong virility it has exhibited since the start of World War ii.” (Text)	_	_
February 2: Charles W. Harper, Director of NASA Hq. Aeronautics Div., discussed aeronautical research at a luncheon of the Aviation/Space Writers Association. He said: “ . . . aviation has a tremendous potential in the short-haul ‘aerial bus.’ Both vtol (vertical take-off and landing) and stol (short take-off and landing) are being considered for this job. . . . On the basis of our current knowledge I would conclude the vtol commercial transport offers tremendous potential but requires additional research . . . before it is ready for detailed feasibility study as a commercial transport. On the other hand the STOL machine is ready for a careful examination since the major problems seem to be in hand.
“A 20 to 50 passenger stol machine should, or could, have a top speed of 300 to 400 knots, a steep approach with a touch down at 45 knots and an operational field length of some 1200 to 1500 feet. Allweather operation is required and, with the aid of space technology advances, this appears quite possible. We think we can display electronically to the pilot the important features of the airport so that he can approach it and land using the same information that he does in clear weather.
“We see two large markets for vehicles of this type. In a smaller simple version, perhaps bearing a little sacrifice in performance, an air transport well suited for use in underdeveloped areas. Rugged, easy to fly and simple to maintain, it could enable these countries to jump from jungle or desert trails to modern transport system without building enormously expensive railways and highways. This would be a good market for U.S. industry. In a larger sophisticated version it could be the vehicle to make the present short haul feeder lines self sufficient, not depending on connecting traffic from the trunk lines. This too would be a desirable situation for American industry. NASA plans to pursue both of these potentials actively until the air industry has enough confidence in success to proceed on its own. . . .” (Text) Alfred J. Eggers, Jr., NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, addressed the Science Teachers’ Association of Santa Clara County, Calif., at NASA Ames Research Center. He said: “The question then is, w’hat has man done in space to date? According to the eminent archaeologist, V. Gordon Childe, whatever man has done in the relatively short evolutionary history documented by his fossil remains, he has done without significantly improving his inherited equipment by bodily changes detectable in his skeleton. Moreover, this equipment is inadequately adapted for survival in any particular environment, and indeed it is inferior to that of most ani-
mals for coping with any special set of conditions. Yet in spite of his physical inferiority, man has been able to adjust himself to a greater range of environment than any other creature, to multiply much faster than any near relative amongst the higher mammals, and indeed to beat them all at their special tricks. Thus he learned to control fire, and he developed the skills to make clothes and houses, with the result that he lives and thrives from pole to pole on earth, and already he is concerned with a population explosion. He has developed trains and cars that can outstrip the fleetest cheetah, and he has developed the airplane so that he can mount higher than the eagle. Moreover, he developed telescopes to see further than the hawk, and firearms to lay low the elephant or any other animal, including himself. But whatever their use, the important point is that fire, clothes, houses, trains, airplanes, telescopes, and guns are not part of man’s body. He can set them aside at will. They are not inherited in the biological sense, but rather the skill needed for their conception, production, and use is part of our intellectual heritage, the result of a tradition built up over many generations and transmitted not in the blood but through speech and writing.
“The true stepping stones to the moon are ourselves and our forefathers. The stepping stones beyond are our children, and much of what they will be and where they will lead the human race, is up to you and your kind. If you succeed in your work, you will have made an invaluable contribution to the betterment of man’s ability to make himself, to master himself, and finally to understand himself in his environment. Indeed, if you are especially successful, you may, in the words of V. R. Potter, ‘develop a new breed of scholars, men who combine a knowledge of new science and old wisdom, men who have the courage of the men of the Renaissance who thought truth was absolute and attainable,’ and who may yet be right. I submit we can do no less than find out.” (Text)
February 2: Philco Corp., opposing the bid by the Communications Satellite Corporation to supply dod with communications satellite service, asked the FCC to prevent ComSatCorp from signing a “sole source” contract with Hughes Aircraft Co. Philco, which was already preparing a satellite system for DOD under a contract awarded in July 1963, said ComSatCorp’s proposed contract “is in violation of the letter and spirit of the FCC rules and regulations which require competition in ComSatCorp procurement.” Since ComSatCorp apparently had been negotiating the matter for some time, “its present statement that stringent time requirements impel waiver of the Fee’s rules and regulations is insupportable,” Philco said.
Under ComSatCorp’s plan, dod would be supplied 24 satellites built by Hughes Aircraft Co. and would pay for service only if the satellites worked. ComSatCorp would absorb the costs if they did not. DOD had made no decision for or against the offer. (Wash. Eve. Star, 2/2/65; upi, NYT, 2/3/65, 54)

Preliminary orbital elements; apogee, 393 mi.; perigee, 343 mi.; perioJ, 97 min.; inclination, 33°. The 545-lh. spacecraft included parts salvaged from the Oso B. damaged last April prior to launch, and components of a spacecraft built for prototype testing.
The second of eight spacecraft planned by NASA for direct observation of the sun, oso II carried eight scientific experiments and had two main sections: the wheel (lower) section provided stability by gyroscopic spinning and housed the telemetry, command, batteries, control electronics and gas spin-control arms, and live experiment packages; the sail (upper) section was oriented toward the sun and contained solar cells and solar-pointing experiments. For the first rime, the instruments, controlled by ground command, would scan the entire solar surface. Each scan required four minutes.

At the end of this ten-year period, we will have received back from our operating spacecraft the basic measurements of the space environment which will give us a much better scientific understanding of this environment and our engineers will have proved out the developmental concepts and engineering designs for effective operations of all kinds in space. Further, we will have a launch capability of six Saturn ib’s and six Saturn V’s per year, meaning that we could put almost two million pounds into orbit per year, if required. We will have logged more than five thousand hours of astronaut spaceflight time and learned a great deal about the relationship between man, equipment, the task assigned, and performance in the space environment. . . .” (Text)

• nasa Administrator James E. Webb, at Nebraska Wesleyan Univ. to
receive an honorary doctorate, said in a speech:	“. . . while our
national policy is to maximize the peaceful uses of outer space . . . and to avoid the extension of weapons, we have no choice but to acquire a broadly-based total capability in space; a capability that can enable us to insure the protection of our national security interests while we actively seek cooperative peaceful development. . . .
“The Roman mastery of land and sea communications, the English mastery of the seas, the American mastery of the air and of nuclear energy were each accompanied by greatly enhanced prestige and followed by vast increases in power and position, new knowledge, the establishment of strategic international economic advantages, the wide use of new resources, great advances in military capability, and a quickening of national pride and vigor. Portentous realignments
among nations were inevitable. These are the advantages the Russians now seek from their enormous investments in space. These are the advantages we cannot permit them to acquire and use against the non-Communist world.
“In these lessons of history lies the real challenge of space. The portents for our own time are clear enough in the early lead of the Soviet Union with the first Sputnik, Vostok, and Voskhod. The spurt in Soviet prestige brought a new assurance and weight in the international political arena, a new pride and confidence in Soviet national purpose. We have reacted quickly and with ever-increasing success, but the challenge of the mastery of space remains to be accomplished for us as a nation and for you as a member of the new generation. We are meeting this challenge, and in doing so enhancing the broadest values for our society and our world.

February 8-10: American Astronautical Society presented a Symposium on Unmanned Exploration of the Solar System in Denver, Colo. Speaking about the Biosatellite Program, Dale W. Jenkins, NASA Office of Space Science and Applications said:
“ . . . The Biosatellite Program is a second-generation series of carefully planned and selected experiments, including some highly sophisticated experiments which have required several years of baseline study and development. These orbiting recoverable Biosatellites provide an opportunity to test critically major biological hypotheses in the areas of genetics, evolution, and physiology. The Biosatellite studies will help delineate hazards to astronauts and assist in determining and defining effects on degradation of human performance. Prolonged manned flights may involve, for example, physiological changes such as decalcification of bones (particularly the vertebrae), loss of muscle tone and physical capability, and certain cardiovascular changes. Also, the effect of continued sensory deprivation on behavior and performance is unknown.
“Twenty experiments have been selected for flight to study the effects of weightlessness and decreased gravity during 3- to 30-day orbital periods. The experiments include a wide variety of plants and animals from single-cell organisms to higher plants and animals. The effects of weightlessness will be studied on the primate, especially the central nervous, the cardiovascular, and the skeletal systems during orbits of 30 days’ duration.
“Experiments have been selected to study the effects of weightlessness combined with a known source of radiation to determine if there are any antagonistic or synergistic genetic or somatic effects on various organisms.
“Experiments are included to study the effects of the unique environment of the Earth-orbiting satellite and removal from the Earth’s rota-
tion in relation to biological rhythms of plants and animals. . . .” (Text)
Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, outlining progress made toward the objective of solar system exploration, said:	“ ... It would appear . . . that
enough experience and know-how has been accumulated to make the move to a five-ton Voyager spacecraft on the Saturn ib Centaur launch vehicle a reasonable next step in the unmanned exploration of the solar system. There is no question but that the size and weight of Voyager, plus the increased demands that will be placed upon it, will make the development of the Voyager a complex and difficult undertaking. But certainly, the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory and Mariner have shown us that we can deal successfully with complexity. As a matter of fact, the increased weight and size may afford considerable relief from the need to tailor every last function to a gnat’s eyebrow in order to achieve the intended mission, as has been the case hitherto. . . .”
Dr. Newell said that reliability was probably the most difficult problem for deep-space long-duration missions and that “. . . the development of adequate spacecraft systems will not be the problem. The most serious threat to long life operation will lie in the potential random failure of one or more [spacecraft] components.”
He added that this would probably be an ever-decreasing problem as we gained experience with launch vehicles and that “. . . launch vehicle reliability is far less a difficult program than that of long spacecraft lifetime for very deep-space missions.”
In conclusion, Dr. Newell said:	"... Nevertheless, the time
has arrived when many thoughtful people urge a vigorous program of solar system exploration. The President has in his Fiscal Year 1966 budget request included funds to support initial conceptual and design studies of a Voyager spacecraft. Funds are also included for the development of a launch vehicle consisting of the Saturn IB plus the Centaur. Final decision as to whether to move ahead with the development of the Voyager spacecraft would come a little over a year from now.” (Text)
Missiles and Rockets reported that scientists at the Symposium had differing opinions on Mars goals. Gilbert V. Levin of Hazleton Laboratories opposed the 1971 scheduled landing of the Voyager:	“. . .
although we insist that Mars should not be contaminated by terrestrial life before we search for Martian life, we fail to recognize that this is tantamount to saying that the U.S. must get there first, because the U.S. appears to be the only nation willing and able to sterilize its spacecraft.
“I’m all for Voyager, but an initial step in the Voyager program should be some early landers at the earliest opportunities. We should go ahead and devote efforts to develop a program to land on Mars in 1969.”
Temple Neumann, Automated Biological Laboratory program engineer with Philco’s Aeronutronic Div., agreed with Levin:	“If the
planetary biological exploration task is to be performed in a sound scientific manner, the U.S. must do it—first.”
Lawrence B. Hall, nasa Special Assistant for Planetary Quarantine, re-emphasized “the disastrous effects that an unsterilized spacecraft could have on Mars. ... If a single micro-organism should land on Mars and have a replication time of 30 days, it could grow to the bacterial population of Earth in eight years. This could not only compete with Martian life but could result in drastic changes in the geochemical and atmospheric characteristics of the planet.”
JPL’s Gerald A. Soffen said that “since the decision between Mariner landers and Voyager missions has not been made yet, scientific experimenters have to think in terms both of small payloads and large ones. Numerous small missions would provide a good opportunity to perform experiments in different locations and during different planetary seasons.”
Bruce C. Murray, of Cal Tech, said:	“. . . finding the right loca-
tion, getting there, and interpreting the biological experiment results in a way that would indicate definitively whether life was or was not present would call for at least 100 times more photography than was currently assumed.
“ . . . atmospheric effects, color, seasonal changes, and the large number of locations of interest will make Martian pictures 10-50 times more difficult to interpret than lunar pictures.”
Robert L. Sohn, TRW Space Technology Laboratories, stressed value of earth-return missions and recommended serious consideration of round-trip missions and multi-plan round trips using DSIF as guide. He suggested that an 800-lb. spacecraft could make a fly-by of Mars, using the Venus swing-by technique and return to earth to enable recovery of a 50-lb. capsule. Use of swing-by techniques for round trips reduces earth launch velocities to those of the favorable years and also reduces earth reentry velocities. Additional advantages were closer passage with Mars at encounter and the opportunity to gather data on two planets.
Elie A. Shneour, of Stanford University, said he “. . . could not say whether it was possible to draw up a set of experiments that would definitively search for life.” He maintained, however, that “discovery of any form of extraterrestrial life will be tantamount to a basic determination of the nature of all life on that planet.” (M&R, 2/22/ 65, 39, 41)	...
February 9: Joint Congressional Atomic Energy Committee, in hearing on aec’s fy 1966 authorization, asked nasa Administrator James E. Webb why NASA was dropping funds for the Snap-8 spacecraft nuclear auxiliary power project. In the joint nasa-aec project, aec was working on the reactor and NASA was working on the power conversion machinery. Snap-8 was one of three projects that had been deleted from the nasa fy 1966 budget request. Mr. Webb said:	“	... in
the over-all budgeting . . . the President has a hard problem of adjusting resources to the needs of the Government. In this case, it was decided that these systems, these three systems, could not be financed within the resources available for allocation to NASA and therefore they were eliminated in the final decision relating to the President’s budget, but not on our recommendation. . . .
“Because we are on the verge of significant technical milestones with our power conversion equipment, we believe we should phase out
the program in an orderly way and provide the maximum amount of experience and data for future use.
“Therefore, we plan to continue current testing of components combined in the test loop to achieve at least 1,000 hours of operating time on each of the major components, by reprogramming our remaining fiscal year 1965 funds into these specific task areas.
“. . . we expect to present to you and the committees, if you will permit us to do so, an orderly plan for using the resources we now have. This gives the Congressional Committees an opportunity to look at and plan and decide whether it does really fit what they believe is in the national interest rather than to take a sudden action. . . .”
Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D-N.Mex.), Chairman of the Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, expressed his belief “that it is too bad that the Bureau of the Budget trimmed you down on this work. I wish you had gone ahead with it through the test period, we would have learned some very significant things. I disassociate it from the other two [canceled projects] but Snap-8 should have gone on priority.” (Transcript)

•	At an aec FY 1966 authorization hearing, Rep. Melvin Price (D-Ill.),
acting chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, attacked “wasteful, irresponsible vacillation” in developing nuclear power systems for use in space. He cited the Snap-50 project which “in 1962 had a development objective through flight test. About a year ago, the flight test objective was dropped for a complete flight system ground test. This year, we have had another change in ob-
jective, dropping the complete system ground test and cutting back to component test objectives. It thus appears we are moving rapidly backward in this program. . . .”
Rep. Price said millions of dollars were being spent to develop these power sources for dod and NASA, but that the projects were often stopped short of flight testing because of lack of funds. He mentioned “several specific construction items which were not approved by the Budget . . . [because] there was no indication of a user for the finished product. . . .
“The concern of the Committee is that this seems to be a pattern that happens on so many of these projects. Usually when it starts, you put several more millions in for a few years and then finally cut it off completely. . . . We are just worried about this pattern. If we thought it was going to end with the same result, it might be wise to cut it off earlier rather than later. ...

its third stage (transtage) and two satellites into orbit in a maneuverability test involving three different orbits. Primary goal of the mission was triple ignition of the transtage’s engine. First firing, about five minutes after launch, injected the 7,000-lb. rocket-payload
assembly into near-earth orbit of 128-mi. apogee and 108-mi. perigee. After traveling once around the earth, during which the rocket performed a deliberate somersault, the transtage ignited again, burned 37 sec., and shifted the rocket into an elliptical orbit of 1,766-mi. apogee and 116-mi. perigee. During one and one half orbits around the earth, the rocket performed a second deliberate somersault; a third firing put it in circular orbit with parameters of apogee, 1,737 mi.; perigee, 1,721 mi.; period, 145.6 min.; and inclination, 32.15°.
Titan hi-a’s transtage then ejected a 69-lb. experimental communications satellite (les i), and ejected a 1,000-lb. metal chunk to demonstrate its ability to launch more than one payload.
LES I was to have fired a solid-propellant motor to move to an elliptical orbit with an apogee of 11,500 mi. and perigee of 1,725 mi., but the motor failed to fire. LES I continued to orbit near the transtage and the metal chunk, les 1 (Lincoln Experimental Satellite) had been built by mit’s Lincoln Laboratory to test advanced components, materials, and techniques which might apply to future communications satellites. Radio signals were to be exchanged between les i and ground stations, (upi, NYT, 2/12/65; ap, Houston Post, 2/12/65; ap, Balt. Sun, 2/12/65; U.S. Aeron. & Space Act., 1965, 133)
February 11: Flight testing of the parachute landing system for two-man Gemini spacecraft was completed.

•	faa released the first two volumes of a comprehensive five-part re-
port on the sonic boom public-reaction study conducted in Oklahoma City in 1964. Their main conclusion: weather had a greater effect in determining the strength of booms than suspected, but the effect was within a corrective capability.
The first volume, “Sonic Boom Exposures During faa Community-Response Studies Over a Six-Month Period in the Oklahoma City Area,” prepared by NASA Langley Research Center, said measurements taken directly under the flight path of the supersonic fighters showed that about 80% of the booms were lower in intensity than scientists expected. About 20% equalled or exceeded the anticipated levels.
“Meteorological Aspects of the Sonic Boom,” prepared by the Boeing Co., revealed that: weather had a greater effect on booms generated by planes flying less than mach 1.3 than those produced by aircraft exceeding mach 1.3; overpressures were increased by headwinds but
decreased by tailwinds and crosswinds, with variations as much as 20%, particularly in the mach 1.3 range; under some atmospheric conditions, including such factors as wind, temperature, and even the time of day, sonic booms may vary from a complete cut-off with no boom heard to heavy overpressures concentrated over a small area or spread almost unlimited over a wide lateral area; turbulence had the effect of distorting booms and increasing or decreasing intensity and distribution, (faa Release 65-15; UPI, Minn.

February 11: In a luncheon address to the National Security Industrial Association in Washington, D.C., Lt. Gen. W. A. Davis (usaf), Vice Cdr. of Air Force Systems Command, discussed AFSC accomplishments in 1964: “. . . Important strides were also made in the area of space. We carried out intensive studies on the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol). Last month the Secretary of Defense announced that proposals are being requested from industry for design studies to assist in developing the cost and technical information needed to proceed with full scale development of the MOL. Titan hi, the Standard Launch Vehicle 5A, completed two highly successful test launches. Systems Command also provided support to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. This included the use of the Atlas-Agena combination to launch Ranger 7 on its successful photographic mission to the moon and Mariner 4 on its way to Mars. We also conducted the first launch of the man-rated Titan II. It was very successful.
“There are a number of tasks ahead of us in space. One of our most promising present programs is the Titan ill space launching system. The Titan in will be used to launch the 24 satellites for the interim Defense Satellite Communications System. It will also be used to launch the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol), which is designed to determine man’s capability to perform military functions in space. The mol will have an important bearing on our future space capabilities.” (afsc Release)	.

•	Christopher C. Kraft, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center director of flight
operations, said the three-orbit Gemini gt-3 flight with astronauts Virgil I. Grissom (usaf) and John W. Young (usn) would be much safer than Project Mercury orbital space flights. The astronauts would not depend solely on the braking rockets to bring them back to earth. They would make maneuvers during the first and third orbits to bring the spacecraft back through the atmosphere even if retrofiring braking rockets failed. Toward the end of the third orbit, near Hawaii, Grissom would fire the rockets for about two minutes, .sending the Gemini spacecraft into a 54-mi. orbit which would be a reentry path. Over Los Angeles, the main braking rockets would be fired to drive the spacecraft down to a landing about 70 mi. east of Grand Turk Island in the Atlantic Ocean. Kraft said if the braking rockets did not fire, the gt-3 craft would land about 1,000 mi. due west of Ascension Island. (Galveston News-Tribune, 2/16/65)

•	President Johnson sent to Congress his annual reports on the National
Science Foundation, the ComSatCorp, and U.S. participation in the International Atomic Energy Agency. In message accompanying the NSF report. President Johnson said: “Close and understanding accord between science and public affairs is an imperative for free societies today.” Science would be looked to for use in technology and industry, health programs, exploration, and, “most especially for the guidance that will permit us to proceed with greater security and greater confidence toward our goals of peace and justice in a free world.”
In a message accompanying the report on the ComSatCorp, the President said the goal of the U.S. was “to provide orbital messengers, not only of word, speech and pictures, but of thought and hope” for the world.
“The past year has seen important advances in the program to develop a global communications satellite system. The first launch of a commercial satellite is to take place in the early months of this year.
“Through the initiative of the United States an international joint venture has been established. Under the law I have designated the Communications Satellite Corp. as the U.S, participant. The corporation is to be the manager on behalf of all participants.
“The corporation has now been financed, has constituted its first board of directors to replace the original incorporators and has moved forward with its program. All agencies of the Government with responsibilities under the act have made important and faithful contributions with the sympathetic assistance of the congressional committees concerned.
“The newr and extraordinary satellite telecommunications medium bringing peoples around the globe into closer relationship is nearer to fulfillment, heralding a new day in world communications.”
In its second annual report ComSatCorp noted that it had ended 1964 with about $190 million in short-term holdings and more than

•	Dr. Karl G. Harr, Jr., President of Aerospace Industries of America, Inc.,
addressed the Economic Club of Detroit:
“. . . the aerospace industry of today does indeed represent a truly unique phenomenon in industrial history in almost all of its aspects. ... it is that industry which places at the disposal of the nation—both its public and its private sectors—the capacity to manage the research, development and production of the most technologically advanced product that is possible—for whatever purpose desired.
“. . . it is essential that we all understand the principal factors—■ historical, present and future—that have produced and will continue to produce this uniqueness.
“First, the genesis and evolution of what is today’s aerospace industry is a direct product of the nation’s post-World War II history and is inextricably linked thereto. . . . World War II unleashed for the world, but particularly for the United States, two revolutions which have been gaining momentum ever since. The first of these was a form of economic revolution which saw the economy of the United States surge into new dimensions. The second was a scientific/ technological revolution which saw all that had gone before in man’s scientific history fade into a pale background. . . .
“World War II itself provided an extreme example of the explosive expansibility of the industrial base of the United States. This expanded industrial base remained after the war to serve as a foundation for a general economic upsurge.
“. . . the aerospace industry has become and remains, in a very real sense, an instrument of national policy, not only in terms of the hardware directly provided the government, but also as it underpins the economic/technological advances in the private sector of our economy. ...”
Discussing the future of the industry, Harr noted that “the size and viability of this industry is not tied to defense and space programs, important as these have been and will continue to be in shaping its destiny. It is tied, rather, to the total technological progress of the nation, meaning the application of advanced technology to whatever purposes may be desired. Programs now well underway in such diverse fields as air freight, urban transportation, desalination, oceanography, 2000-mph aircraft and hundreds of others serve to illustrate this fact. . . .” (Text)

February 16: Saturn I (sa-9) two-stage launch vehicle, launched by NASA from Cape Kennedy, orbited a 33,000-lb. multiple payload, of which
3,200 lbs. was the pegasus i meteoroid detection satellite. Orbital data:	apogee, 745 km. (162 mi.); perigee, 496 km. (308 mi.) ; period,
97 min.; and inclination, 31.7°. This was the eighth successful test in eight flights for Saturn I; pegasus i was the first active payload launched in the Saturn tests.
At launch, an Apollo command and service module boilerplate (bp-16) and launch escape system (Les) tower were atop Saturn I, with pegasus I folded inside the service module. After first-stage separation and second-stage ignition, Les was jettisoned. When second stage (s-iv) attained orbit, the 10,000-lb. Apollo boilerplate command and service modules were jettisoned into a separate orbit. Then a motor-driven device extended winglike panels on the Pegasus satellite to a span of 96 ft. Each wing consisted of seven frames hinged together and made up of 208 panels, pegasus i remained attached to Saturn I’s second stage as planned. A television camera, mounted on the interior of the service module adapter, provided pictures of the satellite deploying in space.
PEGASUS I exposed more than 2.300 sq. ft. of instrumented surface, with thicknesses varying up to 16/1006 in. As meteoroid particles collided with the surface of the panels, they would be registered electronically and reported to earth. Exposure of the large panel area over a long period would give designers of manned and unmanned spacecraft a good sample of meteoroid data.

February 17: nasa’s ranger viii spacecraft, equipped with six television cameras to photograph part of the moon’s surface, was successfully launched from Cape Kennedy by an Atlas-Agena B. Seven minutes after lift-off, the spacecraft and the Agena stage went into a parking orbit some 115 mi. above Africa; the Agena engines were cut off.
For the next 14 min., the combination coasted at 17,500 mph. Second burn of the Agena lasted 90 sec., increased the velocity to 24,476 mph, and freed the 808.8-lb. ranger viii from the major pull of the earth’s gravity. Several minutes after injection, ranger viii was separated from Agena, which entered an elliptical orbit. About an hour after launch, ranger viii received and obeyed the command to deploy the solar panels that would convert solar energy to electrical power for its equipment. About 31/) hrs. after launch, ranger viii completed its orientation maneuvering, achieved attitude stabilization, and pointed a high-powered antenna toward earth.
The projected impact area was the Sea of Tranquility, a dark area relatively free of crater rays, near the shadow line on the three-quarter moon. Lower-angle lighting was expected to give more contrast and better definition of detail than was in the photographs made by ranger vii.

This means that we cannot accomplish the 15 Saturn V-Apollo flights now included in the program within the period of this decade. If all 15 flights are required to succeed in the lunar landing, then this will not be done before 1970. However, our overall major milestones are being met and we still have a reasonable opportunity for success on a flight earlier than the 15th and thus within this decade. In effect we will be launching toward the moon on earlier flights than we thought a year ago would be possible, but we simply cannot predict which flight will be the first either to orbit the moon or to land there.
“What we can say is this:	the systems of equipment for the utiliza-
tion of men for flights of all kinds out as far as the moon are now rapidly proceeding toward tests that will work out any imperfections; and our fast-developing knowledge of both the space environment and the capabilities of this equipment gives us more confidence than we had a year ago that we are on the right track and proceeding on a reasonable basis for the development of machines of this size and power. . . .
“In preparation of this budget, the President has faced two important facts. The first of these is that the central core of NASA activities as planned in 1961 is proceeding with excellent results. . . .
“The second major fact faced by the President was the necessity for a continued emphasis on supporting research and development. . . .
“Bearing these two facts in mind, this budget and this request for authorization call for an operating level which is approximately the same as that approved by Congress for fiscal years 1964 and 1965. This means that the work planned in 1961 for accomplishment in this decade must be spread out over a longer period, and the cost for the total will be increased. . . .
“The essential funds to give us some opportunity to make the lunar landing within this decade are included, as are funds for studies toward further use of the Saturn launch vehicles and the Appollo-LEM manned space flight systems in the period following the lunar landing. By 1969, we will have the capability to launch 6 Saturn-iB’s and 6 Saturn V’s per year. In the unmanned area, we have begun planning for a Voyager-Mars mission in 1971 with the possibility of a test flight in 1969; funds are included in the budget for expansion of this design effort during fiscal year 1966. Development and hardware procurement could then be initiated in fiscal year 1967 if appropriate. . . .” (Testimony; 1966 NASA Auth. Hearings, 5-14)
February 17: Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, NASA Deputy Administrator, testified before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics on nasa’s activities in the field of international cooperation: “Nineteen sixty-four was a year in which other nations emerged clearly as friendly competitors and valuable collaborators in space science and engineering and demonstrated by emulation their endorsement of our view that energetic efforts in these fields are essential contributors to the betterment of human society. I am thinking of such things as the energetic space programs of France, the demonstrated competence of Canada and Italy, the entry of the British aircraft industry into spacecraft engineering, the formal establishment of the European Space Research
Organization (esro) and the European Launcher Development Organization (eldo), and finally of the successful first test flight of a large new booster by eldo. . . .
“A year ago I reported our plans for including foreign experiments on NASA satellites under arrangements by which foreign experiments, selected in open competition with domestic proposals, are sponsored and financed by the experimenter’s national space authority. One such experiment flew in 1964—a British ion mass spectrometer on explorer xx, the U.S. fixed-frequency topside sounder. Six additional experiments were selected for flight, bringing the total to thirteen, with ten more under active consideration. We now have opened virtually all categories of NASA spacecraft, including Gemini and Apollo, to foreign participation on this cooperative basis. Indeed, we are now inviting foreign biomedic experts to a working conference in Houston, next April, to learn directly of the opportunities and constraints which apply to this program. . . .
“A noteworthy development was the fact that esro became the first foreign space agency to seek a ground station on American territory. After conducting a site survey and finding a suitable location near Fairbanks, Alaska, esro has formally requested the Department of State to begin negotiations for an agreement. The ESRO station is projected as an element in a network of tracking and data acquisition facilities. . . . France is establishing a North/South fence from France through the Canary Islands, Algeria, Upper Volta, Congo Brazzaville, and South Africa, with an injection-monitoring station in Lebanon. This chain will also serve esro, which expects to have additional stations at Spitsbergen, Brussels, and in Australia and the South Atlantic. Both the ESRO and French networks will be entirely compatible with nasa’s, to maximize possibilities for mutual assistance. This is to our advantage, and we encourage it. . . .
“Let me bring you up to date on the status of our cooperation with the Soviet Union. You will recall that we have a series of agreements with the Soviet Academy of Sciences providing for three coordinated projects—in meteorology, in surveying the geomagnetic field, and use of ECHO II for communications tests. The project involving the observation and use of echo ii is completed. The Soviet side observed the critical inflation phase of the satellite optically and forwarded the data to us; although not including radar data, which would have been most desirable. Communications via echo ii between the U.K. and the U.S.S.R. were carried out in only one direction instead of two, at less interesting frequencies than we would have liked, and with some technical limitations at the ground terminals used. On the other hand, the Soviets provided very complete recordings and other data of their reception of the transmissions.” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 15-37)
February 17: Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Associate Administrator, told the House Committee on Science and Astronautics:	“I feel that
our record over the past calendar year is evidence of the success we have had in building a team that is dedicated to effective management. The space flight record for 1964 is impressive by several standards:	num-
ber of flights, percent of success, and variety of missions. The graph (spaceflight mission record) shows that, in terms of percentage, our
1964 success record is nearly the same as the high achieved in 1963; 83 percent compared with 85 percent in 1963. However, we more than doubled the number of successful missions from 1963 to 1964, from 11 to 25. . . .
“Other significant measures of the pace and rate of change in our space program have been our performance in terms of spacecraft operations and data return. These performance indicators are at the heart of a successful space program.
“For example, in 1964 an average of 54 experiments were functioning in space throughout the year; this is an improvement of over 35 percent from 1963, when we averaged 40 working experiments.
“The volume of information brought back from space, measured in millions of data points per day, shows a tenfold increase over previous years:	in 1964 we were collecting about 57 million bits of
information each day from our flight missions. . . .”
Dr. Seamans listed NASA management accomplishments during the past year “to find new techniques and new methods to carry out our jobs.” Among them:	establishment of Mission Analysis Div. from the
Hq. Office of Advanced Research and Technology at Ames Research Center; conducting the joint dod-nasa Launch Vehicle Cost Study; growth of incentive contract program (“over $1 billion are under active incentive contracts”) ; and application of phased project planning.
“The budget presented here has already undergone critical review by NASA’s management, the Bureau of the Budget, and the President. It does not provide any contingency funds for the approved missions; it is predicated on a cost reduction program that will require us to operate more efficiently; it represents a carefully pared program priority list. In summary:
“First, NASA is dedicated to the accomplishment of the present approved missions and projects in terms of cost, schedule, and technical performance.
“Second, new effort is needed to maintain a position of leadership in aeronautics and space. This includes the definition of a new program for exploration of the planets commencing with Mars in 1971; the research and design necessary for effective extension of present Apollo and Saturn capabilities for manned flight; integration of the Centaur stage with the Saturn launch vehicle for planetary and other unmanned payloads; initiation of an advanced solar observatory satellite; and utilization of a prototype xb-70 aircraft for aeronautical research.
“Third, an aggressive research and advanced development effort must be maintained in many fields, including chemical and nuclear propulsion, to assure the nation meaningful options and alternatives in the selection of future aeronautical and space goals and the ability to react decisively to external pressures and opportunities. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 37-51)
February 17: Experimental solar still stations were being tested by Dr. Everett D. Howe, director of the Univ. of California at Berkeley’s Sea Water Conversion Laboratory, it was reported. The small stills were located on islands in the South Pacific, where climate was favorable for testing solar distillation. The stills, made of light plastic and concrete or of metal and glass, produced two to five gallons of pure water a day.
Knowledge gained from the operation might eventually help the thousands of persons in nonindustrial countries where water was in short supply and fuel and energy for such things as distillation of water was scarce. (NYT, 2/17/65, 28)

He claimed strategic rocket troops now formed the backbone of the Soviet armed forces so that the effectiveness of the Soviet air force had been sharply increased by supersonic planes equipped with nuclear-tipped, long-range rockets. He said the Soviet navy was now built around atomic submarines of virtually unlimited range that were equipped with powerful missiles. New Soviet antiaircraft defenses were capable of reaching targets flying at any speed at any altitude.

February 18: ranger viii lunar probe successfully executed a midcourse maneuver that corrected the path established at launch and aimed it for impact on the moon in the Sea of Tranquillity, an area centered 2.6° north of the lunar equator and 24.8° west of the moon’s north-south line. Signal for the maneuver was radioed from earth to activate commands previously stored in the spacecraft’s computer. At that time, the 808-lb. photo probe was 99,281 mi. from earth, traveling
toward the moon at 4,100 mph. First command ordered the spacecraft to roll 11.6°; the second ordered the pitch maneuver of 151.7°; the third commanded the motor to burn for 59 sec. Then, after the spacecraft was ordered to break its attitude stabilization locks on the sun and earth, a “go” command was transmitted and ranger viii executed the maneuver in about 27 min. The correction completed, the spacecraft reacquired its stabilization locks and continued on its course. One measure of the accuracy of the maneuver was the current expected impact time on the moon:	Feb. 20 at 4:57:30 a.m. plus or
minus 60 sec. The original planned time was 4:57:30 a.m.
The photo probe’s initial course would have missed the trailing edge of the moon by 1.136 mi. (NASA Transcript; L.A. Times. Miles, Wash. Post, 2/19/65; Appel, NYT, 2/19/65; upi, Phil. Eve. Bull., 2/18/65; ap, Chic. Trib., 2/19/65; Av. Wk., 2/22/65, 34)
February 18: Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, reviewing overall manned space flight objectives and reporting on the Gemini and Apollo programs in testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said:
“Chronologically, the first objective of manned space flight is to establish man’s capabilities in space. Next is the establishment of a national competence for manned space flight, including the industrial base, trained personnel, ground facilities, flight hardware, and operational experience. Next, we use this capability for further space explorations and for other purposes. Finally, accomplishment of all these objectives brings about United States leadership in space.
“. . . In 1964, we concentrated our efforts on Gemini ground tests and accomplished the first flight test. Filling the pipeline with hardware and carrying out development testing of subsystems were the major Apollo activities. Now in 1965, we have entered a year that will be devoted to Gemini flight test operations and the conduct of Apollo system development tests.
“Looking at the remainder of the decade, 1966 will be the year when we learn new' space flight techniques in the Gemini Program, and conduct unmanned earth-orbital flight tests of the Apollo/Saturn IB space vehicle. In 1967, Gemini will be available as an operational system and we will carry out manned earth-orbital flights of the Apollo/ Saturn V space vehicle. Manned flights of the Apollo/Saturn V space vehicle are scheduled for 1968, leading to the beginning of manned lunar missions before the end of the decade.
“. . . I want to emphasize again that Apollo is an orderly program. The buildup of the Apollo effort has proceeded over more than three and a half years to its full strength. It is not a crash program.
“The duration of Apollo, as we reported to the Congress last year, is one of the longer United States research and development programs, resulting in a schedule that permits rapid, orderly progress. The Apollo priority is high but not overriding. Parallel and backup development efforts are limited. Flight testing is being carried out on a logical basis, and only after all possible tests are conducted on the ground.
“Efficient use of available resources is a major consideration in the conduct of the Apollo program, whereas a crash program follows the most expeditious course regardless of cost.
“Finally, crash programs typically have goals beyond the existing state of technology and pursue these goals under the pressure of having to achieve a technological breakthrough. Apollo, on the other hand, harnesses current technology in the development of launch vehicles, spacecraft and facilities to permit effective space exploration. The greatest challenges in Apollo, in fact, are in the integration of those systems and the men who must fly them as well as the provision of ground operational support, and the overall management of this enterprise.”
Dr. Mueller said that data received and analysis continued in 1964 regarding radiation and the lunar surface indicated that these matters were of less importance than had been previously deduced:	“. . .
First, the chance of a significant solar event occurring during a mission is very low. Second, if the worst solar flare previously observed had occurred during an Apollo mission, the maximum dose that could have been received at the bloodforming organs by astronauts in the command module would have been about 10 per cent of the allowable safe dose, rather than 15 per cent as estimated last year.
“Regarding the lunar surface, the data from ranger vii have been very helpful. The large area photography has indicated the probability that there are many areas of the moon’s surface where the design of the lunar excursion module is adequate with respect to surface slope and roughness. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth.

February 19: In testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, summarized significant mission results: “U.S. scientific satellites achieved the following firsts: discovery of the radiation belt, determination of the earth’s irregular geoid, ionospheric topside sounding (with Canada), solar spectroscopy, x-ray and ultraviolet satellite astronomy, polar orbits, and highly eccentric orbits to map the earth’s magnetosphere. Our deep space probes achieved the first successful direct monitoring of the interplanetary environment, the first lunar surface detail, and the first successful flight to Venus. We may soon achieve the first successful flight to Mars, if mariner iv completes its mission. In launch vehicle development, this program has yielded the first rocket stage using the high energy propellant combination of hydrogen and oxygen. It has also yielded the first and only all solid propellant space booster. U.S. meteorological satellites have yielded the following firsts: daylight cloud photography, night cloud observations including surface and cloud top temperatures, world cloud coverage, global heat balance and stratospheric temperature measurements, and direct cloud picture transmission to local users. Our communication satellites have been first in the following achievements: erection of large structures in space and their use as passive reflectors of radio signals; active repeating of radio signals at various altitudes and orbits of interest to system designers; transoceanic and intercontinental relay of teletype, facsimile, voice, data, and television; and achievement of the first true geostationary orbit.
“The specific record of 1964 space missions of the Space Science and Applications Program ... is particularly informative because most major program areas achieved at least one highly significant success in 1964. Of the 10 scientific satellite missions attempted, 7 achieved full success and 2 partial success.”
Dr. Newell observed that syncom ill communications satellite had been placed in a “virtually perfect circular equatorial orbit,” then maneuvered “to within about 1 mile of its station over the western Pacific where it successfully performed all its planned experiments.
. . . The Syncom maneuver was comparable to the feat of Ranger VII in flying to within 6 miles of its target on the Moon.
“Having completed our experiments with Syncoms II and III, we are turning them over to the Department of Defense. ... If required, full-time communications could be provided between the United States and southeast Asia by Syncom m. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 136-62)

•	NASA approved inclusion of three x-ray and gamma ray telescopes on the
first Oao (Orbiting Astronomical Observatory) and rescheduled the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s celescope experiment for the third Oao.

•	Col. John H. Glenn, Jr. (usmc Ret.), speaking at a National Space Club
luncheon, said: “Looking back over the 3 years since the flight of Friendship 7, J am impressed most of all by the tremendous progress the United States has made in space science and technology.
“I am proud of the determination the American people have shown to become the world’s leading spacefaring nation. . . .
“Three years ago, Mercury spacecraft were limited in weight to about 3,000 pounds. Today, the Saturn I booster is operational and can put 22,500 pounds into Earth orbit, or seven times the weight of Mercury. Saturn i-b, which will begin flying next year, will be able to orbit a payload equal to 11 Mercury spacecraft. Saturn V, which
will fly in 1967, will be able to orbit a payload equal to more than 80 Mercuries. That’s some jump—but it is no more than typical of the great gains we are making in national space capabilities.
“The accuracy requirements for all these missions are almost incomprehensible and are one of the least understood parts of the space program. A good case in point was the launch of Friendship 7 3 years ago. The speed at insertion into orbit was over 25,000 feet per second or 5 miles per second, and the booster and spacecraft were accelerating at approximately 240 feet per second at a steadily increasing rate. At booster cutoff, each error of 1.4 feet per second resulted in a difference of approximately 1 mile in apogee on the far side of the Earth. When you consider that before the onboard signal for cutoff was received, information had to be obtained by radar at the Cape, transmitted by landline to Goddard, run through the computers, returned by landline to the Cape, checked against Cape data and then transmitted 350 miles down range to the spacecraft, still allowing time for onboard delays in operation of relays, valves, and thrust termination, it looks like an almost impossibly accurate requirement.
“Those accuracies, however, are rather crude compared with some now being obtained on the deep space probes.
“Now we have Mariner iv which at 6 o’clock tonight will be 20,194,023 miles out from Earth on an extremely difficult and significant mission. As you know, there was a checkout of equipment aboard the spacecraft last week that indicates the chances are still good that we will get revealing pictures of Mars next July, when Mariner iv will be 134 million miles from Earth, so far it will take 12]/> seconds to get a radio signal back.
“To wax philosophical for a moment, we might liken our space program one of Plato’s allegories, lie told of prisoners disined in & cave for so long they had lost touch with reality and felt that their whole existence was wrapped up in the shadows they could see on the wall ahead of them. He goes on to say that if one escaped to the outside world and returned to tell the others of what really lay outside the dark cave, they would probably think him completely crazy.
“Even though we have seen such tremendous break-throughs in scientific knowledge in recent years, our knowledge has necessarily been limited to such a cave, for practically all we know has been limited to this one tiny speck of earth in a much larger environment. But that is in the process of becoming changed and with a rapidity no one can forecast.” (Text, CR, 2/22/65, A751-531 February 19: Sen. A. S. (Mike) Monroney (D-Okla.) said in an interview that if commercial airlines would voluntarily join the Federal Government in subsidizing helicopter lines, these services might be saved. Commercial helicopter lines operating in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco had received Federal subsidies since 1947, but President Johnson proposed in his budget message that they be cut off after Dec. 31.
Sen. Monroney said: “Congress isn’t going to appropriate any more money. We haven’t a chance of selling them or continuing the subsidy without added help from the airlines.” His plan involved artificially lowering helicopter fares so that a greater portion of the flying public would use them. This higher load factor, combined with the use of
larger, more economical aircraft and hoped-for improvements in helicopter technology might lead to self-sustaining helicopter service in a few years, the Senator said. (NYT, 2/19/65, 69)

February 20: ranger viii lunar photography probe struck its target on the moon at 4:57:36.8 EST, after radioing to earth about 7,000 close-up pictures of the lunar surface during the last 23 min. of flight. The point of impact was 2.59° north latitude, 24.77° east longitude, in the Sea of Tranquillity, an area slightly east-northeast of the center of a full moon. The spacecraft impacted at slightly less than 6,000 mph. Total distance of travel along its trajectory from lift-off had been calculated as 248,766 mi. Accuracy of the shot was reflected in the fact that impact had been planned for 4:57:30, and at 3° north latitude and 24° east longitude.
ranger viii had been programed to execute a “terminal sequence” just before impact to point the six tv cameras more in the direction of flight; this sequence was omitted to allow the cameras to cover a larger area than planned and to provide greater continuity with the pictures transmitted by ranger vii last July 31. A second change in the flight was to turn on cameras 23 min. before impact instead of 13 min. and 40 sec. as planned. The new time had been chosen so that initial pictures would be about equal to earth-based resolution and then continue into impact.
Two small anomalies: one part of the spacecraft had registered a higher temperature than had been anticipated and more telemetry data had been lost during midcourse maneuver than had been expected. ranger viii had been launched Feb. 17 from Cape Kennedy, (nasa Transcript; Appel, NYT, 2/21/65, 1, 65)
•	Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper of the Univ. of Arizona, heading the panel for
scientific evaluation of ranger viii photographs, said at a press
conference that one of the most important results of this flight had been the discovery that the Sea of Clouds and the Sea of Tranquillity were similar in structure. He noted several “odd depressed regions” and said that they could be areas where collapse had occurred, which might suggest the presence of lava fields. He believed the lunar surface was composed of very light, frothy material such as would be formed when rock was melted and allowed to resolidify within a high vacuum, like that on the moon. The material envisioned by Dr. Kuiper might be considered similar to certain volcanic rocks found on earth: while it would probably be lighter than water, it could still have substantial strength. This theory was based on laboratory attempts several years ago to simulate conditions existing when the moon was formed.
Ewen A. Whitaker of the Univ. of Arizona said he felt the lunar material, which he thought had a consistency of crunchy snow, would support a manned spacecraft. He said color lines and sharp boundaries tended to show that the surface was some sort of frothy, lava-like material and definitely not dust.
Another member of the Panel, Dr. Harold C. Urey, of the Univ. of California, noted dimples on the moon’s surface and said their curved walls indicated material must have been thrown out of their centers when comparatively soft terrain was gouged by heavy masses of rock. He thought he saw spots in the center of some dimples into which soft material might be draining and estimated the depth of some dimples at 50 to 60 ft. Dr. Urey also suggested the surface material might have the consistency of crunchy snow, (nasa Transcript; Appel, NYT, 2/21/65; Miles, L. A.

NASA had requested a six-county area of western Iowa to submit rocks for analysis since gsfc astronomer, Dr. Walter O’Keefe, had had the theory that tektites came from the moon. Western Iowa had been chosen as a likely spot for the search for tektite fragments because of its heavy deposits of loose soil and near absence of natural rock formations.

•	U.S.S.R. had kept the U.S. under relatively continuous surveillance
with photo reconnaissance satellites launched as part of the Cosmos program, said Edward H. Kolcum in an article in Aviation Week and Space Technology. In 1964 14 such satellites were launched, he asserted. The article continued: “Soviet photo reconnaissance payload is believed to be an unmanned version of the Vostok spacecraft,
which successfully carried cosmonauts into orbit six times. The unmanned camera mission uses the same launch facilities and same recovery techniques developed from Russian manned satellites. The recoverable section is the pressurized cabin, which weighs about 5,000 lb. when it is ejected from the main spacecraft for a parachute descent on land. . . .
“Six of these payloads were recovered after eight days; two after seven days, one after six days and another after five days. One came down after 24 hr. in orbit; one remained up five weeks, another eight and a half weeks, and another, launched Aug. 29, is still in orbit. Departures from the norm are believed to indicate retrofire malfunctions or failures. Most recent Soviet reconnaissance satellite was Cosmos 52, launched Jan. 11 and recovered Jan. 19. . . .”
He stated that 11 of the 14 reconnaissance satellites orbited in 1964 were orbited at 65° inclination. The remaining three orbited at 51° inclination—“an inclination that also permits the payload to sweep over the entire continental United States.” The other Cosmos satellites, orbited at 49° inclination, had remained in orbit until they decayed naturally. They were “believed to be scientific applications and military development payloads.” {Av. Wk., 2/22/65, 22)

February 23: USAF 1,175-lb. Project Asset reentry glider, last in a test series of six, was launched from Cape Kennedy by a Thor-Delta rocket booster on a 13,300 mph suborbital flight; the spacecraft then was lost at sea. The experiment was to test materials for future lifting body reentry designs; it consisted of 2,000 tiny heat-sensitive spots in ten different colors designed to change hue as the glider came back through the atmosphere from an altitude of 40 mi. usaf said that most of the information sought had been radioed to the ground during the 30 min. flight, but that visual examination of the glider was necessary for data on heat distribution.

•	Addressing the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NASA Administrator
James E. Webb said: “I would like to acknowledge the debt that NASA owes to the armed forces for early and continuing work that has contributed to some of our most successful space projects. As you know, nasa works closely with the Air Force in the development of launch vehicles and in the general technology of space flight. . . .
“As an example—among many—of cooperative nasa-dod activities: on January 1, nasa transferred control of its operating syncom II and syncom ill communications satellites to the Department of Defense. . . .
“When the great dod missile site construction program—which ran at one time to $2.8 billion a year—subsided, the Corps of Engineers brought its tremendous engineering capability to the construction of nasa facilities. As the Corps moved toward completion of its work for nasa, its abilities will have been enhanced by the experience of building these great new national resources. The Corps, with new skills, will be able to move to new national requirements with assurance that it has performed extraordinarily well in engineering fields never before attempted.
“Today there are detailed to NASA 254 active duty military personnel. Five of our astronauts are graduates of this great Academy. Nothing could be more fitting. For the debt modern American science and technology owes to West Point is too large to be repaid. It can visibly be traced back to Sylvanus Thayer who not only is the father of this Academy but who had a tremendous influence for half a century in the field of technical and scientific education throughout the United States.” (Text)
•	Statement of Edmond C. Buckley, NASA Director of Tracking and
Data Acquisition, was presented by Gerald M. Truszynski, NASA Deputy Director of Tracking and Data Acquisition, in testimony before
the House Committee on Science and Astronautics: “Since 1958, NASA has provided tracking and data acquisition support by means of the NASA Satellite Tracking and Data Acquisition Network for approximately 50 dod earth satellites. During 1965 we expect to provide continuing telemetry support for as many as 10 DOD earth satellites, and limited tracking support for several more. Also, our station at Carnarvon, Australia, being in an excellent geographical relation to the launch facilities at Cape Kennedy, will be used to support a number of dod spacecraft, as well as NASA spacecraft, where data and flight control after one-half orbit is required. For example, the dod titan in launch vehicle development program is vitally dependent on support by this station. We anticipate support of approximately 15 titan ill operations per year for the next two years.
“In a similar fashion, the tracking and data acquisition support which the dod provides for nasa is extensive. At Cape Kennedy, for example, DOD has supported the launch phase of each NASA space flight mission. The extensive support provided by DOD for the Mercury program is well known. The Gemini program requires continuation of this dod support.”
Referring in his testimony to current trends affecting planning for support networks, Mr. Buckley said: “. . . equally significant requirement, is the increase in the number of spacecraft which will have highly elliptical or synchronous orbits. Spacecraft in highly elliptical orbits must be supported by a particular ground station, much in the same way as done for deep space missions, i.e., a particular station is required to provide as much as 8—10 hours per day of its available time for support of one satellite. Spacecraft in synchronous orbits require support of a particular station for 24 hours per day. As a result, tracking and data acquisition links are being committed to longer support periods which means not only that more equipment is required, but additional personnel, ground communications, and other operations expenditures are needed to meet this upcoming satellite support workload.” (Testimony; 1966 NASA Auth. Hearings, 187212)

• Rep. John R. Schmidhauser (D-Iowa) commented upon and inserted in the Congressional Record an article which appeared in the Davenport Times-Democrat about the Davenport Alcoa plant and the construction of Pegasus satellites. It said:	“A unique arrangement of special
equipment that senses infrared energy—thus indicating which part of the satellite is facing earth—enables scientists to determine the direction each meteoroid is traveling when it strikes Pegasus. Such information will tell spacecraft designers the extent of possible damage from hits, enabling them to build manned craft which will be relatively unaffected by meteoroids.” {CR, 2/23/65, A77374)
February 23: Scientists at mit’s new Center for Sensory Aids Evaluation and Development were screening and testing new items that could potentially help the blind and deaf-blind, it was reported. Scheduled for early testing was an inertial navigation system that could sense movement off a straight line. It was about the size of a cigaret package and would be held flat between the thumb and index finger. If a blind person holding this battery-operated device in his right hand veered off course to the left, a projection would hit him in the thumb; if he veered off to the right he would be hit in the index finger. The system of gyroscopes and accelerometers that would operate this instrument was also found in missile and spacecraft guidance systems. (Sci. Serv., NYT, 2/23/65, 31)
February 24: Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, nasa Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, told the House Committee on Science and Astronautics that “although space research, development, and operations have absorbed much of our resources within the past few years, the nasa has been and will continue to be dedicated to a strong program of aeronautical research keyed to the Nation’s needs.” He testified:	“. . . The [aeronautics] program embraces the entire
spectrum of flight from lowspeed private and v/stol aircraft to hypersonic vehicles. I have already described . . . our part in the evolution of the xv-5a and F-lll aircraft, in the evaluation of supersonic transport proposals, and in the solution of jet transport rough air problems. Looking ahead to fy 1966, we are requesting $42.2 million in Research and Development for aeronautics. This figure can be separated into two categories:	one funds a broad and
continuing effort in the scientific disciplines underlying advances in all areas of air transportation, civil and military; the other funds a more concentrated attack on specific advances in air transportation whose potential is identified by research in the various scientific disciplines. . . .
“Throughout the aeronautics program budget, provision has been made to support the direct requests of the Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Agency. It can be pointed out that although the Research and Development request in FY 1966 for aeronautics is $42.2 million, we expect to spend a total sum of $106.2 million in this field. The difference is accounted for by Administrative Operations and Construction of Facilities funds as well as supporting research and technology directly applicable to aeronautics in fields such as electronics, human factors, basic research, and others. Approximately 1600 direct personnel will be engaged in aeronautical research in FY
1966.	. . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 213-269)
• In testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, George Friedl, Jr., NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Industry Affairs, said: “nasa spends about 93 percent of its dollars on contracts with industry, universities and private research organizations. These procurements during fiscal year 1964 amounted to $4.6 billion. Approximately 96 percent of this amount or $4.4 billion was awarded by our field installations in accordance with program and project research and development requirements. NASA contracts support our in-house research and development activities and
establish our coupling with industry and the private scientific community. . . .”
Reporting on contract administration, Mr. Friedl testified:	“The
cost reimbursement contract has been the basic instrument for procuring research and development because the Government has had to risk the uncertainties and assume the high cost involved. No other type of contract provides the Government and the contractor the latitude and flexibility needed to relate scientific and technical requirements, schedules and use of resources to mission objectives. By adding incentive provisions pertaining to time, quality and cost to this type of contract, it is our intention to offset some of its deficiencies and strengthen the purpose of the Government-contractor relationship.
“nasa has made a concerted effort to introduce suitable incentive arrangements in our cost reimbursement type contracts whenever practicable. In each case, the objective is to encourage the contractor to manage better and improve his performance; adhere to schedules; and hold down costs.
“As a consequence of our incentive contracting drive, there has been a marked increase in this activity in the past 41/2 years. In fiscal year 1961 we had one contract worth about $100,000. By December 31, 1964, we had awarded 75 contracts with a target value of over $751 million, 7 of these have been completed leaving 68 contracts totalling over $724 million currently being administered. . . .
“In view of the undesirable features of letter contracts, NASA Headquarters began a concerted effort, early in 1963, to curtail the issuance of new letter contracts and to assure the timely definitization of all outstanding letter contracts. Headquarters issued instructions to all centers directing program and project managers to plan ahead and allow adequate lead time for the initial negotiation of definitive contracts. ... At the end of January only 3 letter contracts having a total value of $4 million were outstanding. We expect that these contracts will be definitized in March 1965.”
Mr. Friedl said that NASA had “structured a sound practicable managerial technique to direct the planning, approval and execution of . . . future programs. We believe that adoption of what we have termed ‘phased project planning’ will materially assist us in achieving this goal.
“Phased project planning represents an orderly sequential progression in the execution of NASA major projects. It provides for formulating proposed work goals and missions, and allows for decisions, reappraisal points for management consideration to advance or replan such proposals, as well as the resources to implement them.
“Specifically, phased project planning provides for four distinct phases as follows:
“Phase A Conceptual/Feasibility Phase . . .
“Phase B Preliminary Definition Phase . . .
“Phase C Final Definition . . .
and PhaseDevelopment/Operation. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 269-88)

February 27: Thiokol Chemical Corp. successfully static-fired its 156-in.-dia., lOO-ft.-long solid propellant rocket motor—the largest yet fired— for 64 sec. The 900,000-lb. motor developed over three million lbs. of thrust, consumed over 800,000 lbs. of propellant, and generated temperatures up to 6,000°F. The solid propellant was encased in a halfinch-thick steel and nickel casing which apparently escaped damage. Also left intact was the 10-ton, 20-ft.-tall nozzle which rested on top of the 12-stories-deep testing pit. The motor was fired below ground level. Primary objective of the test was to validate design of the

•	Louis Walter, gsfc geochemist, told ap reporter his research with tektites
indicated lunar surface may be sand-like. The key to this conclusion lay in Walter’s discovery of the presence of coesite in tektites, believed to be particles of the moon sent into space when meteorites impact the lunar surface. Coesite, also found around the world at known meteorite craters and sites believed to have sustained meteoritic impacts, is a form of silicon dioxide—a major constituent of sand—produced under high pressure. “If we accept the lunar origin of tektites, this would prove or indicate that the parent material on the moon is something like the welded tuft that we find in Yellowstone Park, Iceland, New Zealand, and elsewhere,” according to Walter. Welded tuft was said to have some of the qualities of beach sand, (ap, Chic. Trib., 3/1/65)
•	Three Univ. of California (Berkeley) scientists concluded on the
basis of their laboratory studies that Dr. William M. Sinton’s spectroscopic evidence of organic matter on Mars was not valid. Dr. Sinton of Lowell Observatory had made spectroscopic studies of Mars in 1959 that suggested infrared radiation from dark portions of Mars was comparable to that produced by some terrestrial plant life. The California chemists—James S. Shirk, William A. Haseltine, and George C. Pimentel—concluded Dr. Sinton had detected vaporized “deuterated water” (H.O plus heavy hydrogen—deuterium) rather than plant-produced molecules, (upi, S.F. Chron., 2/28/65)
•	NATO officials were examining preliminary bids for a $310 million NATO
Air Defense Ground Environment (Nadge) system that would be used to protect continental Europe from enemy aircraft. Nadge was expected to be an improved version of the Sage system that had been used to defend the United States. At last December’s NATO ministerial meeting, it was agreed that each country be guaranteed Nadge subcontracts equal to the amount the country was contributing to the program. The cost sharing formula for Nadge was based on the con-tributive capacity of the member countries; the advantage accruing to the user country; and the economic benefit to the countries in which the installations would be placed. Under this formula the U.S. was
expected to contribute 30.85% of the cost of the program. (Smith, NYT, 2/28/65, 12F)
February 28: Prospecting for high-grade silver could be done, according to Thor H.

•	New York Times continued its editorial opposition to the national ob-
jective for Project Apollo of landing a man on the moon in this decade. On Feb. 19, an editorial drew from the two successful major launchings of the week (ranger viii and SATURN i sa—9) the lesson that the kinds of experiments on these flights (lunar photography of ranger viii and pegasus I micrometeoroid detection satellite on Saturn I) proved there wrere many unmeasured perils in space and that “In the face of these uncertainties, the American space program ought to retain maximum flexibility of timing, rather than try at all costs to achieve the artificial goal of a manned lunar landing by 1970.”
On Feb. 22, following the successful conclusion of the RANGER VIII lunar photography mission, another editorial praised the accomplishment, then noted that the Ranger series was not providing all of the answers to lunar questions critical to the Apollo program, and concluded:	“The two successful Ranger shots, however, make clear that
much valuable information can be gathered about the earth’s natural satellite by relatively cheap instrument-carrying rockets that do not risk human lives. This demonstration, and the continuing uncertainties about matters essential for a safe manned round trip to the moon, strengthen still more the case for making progress slowly, without any arbitrary deadline, on Project Apollo.” {NYT, 2/19/65, 34; 2/22/65, 20)
•	A warning that “In looking for life on Mars we could establish for
ourselves the reputation of being the greatest Simple Simons of all time” came from Dr. Philip H. Abelson in an editorial in Science. Dr. Abelson was editor of the magazine and director of the Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical Laboratory. He said he did not believe that life, particularly life resembling that on earth, would be found on Mars and proposed “a few inexpensive experiments” on earth to save years, billions of dollars, and the possibility of “considerable eventual disappointment” if the search for life on Mars should prove fruitless.
Attempts to sterilize spacecraft to prevent them from carrying earth organisms to Mars might add “many years and billions of dollars” to
the cost, the editorial said. It suggested, instead, careful selection of experiments to be sent to Mars and “relatively inexpensive studies here on earth” to determine whether sterilization were really necessary. (Clark, NYT, 2/13/65; Wash. Post, 2/13/65)

During February: In a report titled “Federal Funds for Research, Development, and other Scientific Activities,” National Science Foundation said DOD obligations for r&d increased each year from $2.3 billion in 1956 to an estimated $7.5 billion in 1964. Although survey predicted a small decrease to $7.2 hillion for 1965, the 10-yr. period showed a 200% gain. Support to applied research accounted for about 22% of 1965 r&d Defense funds, with 2 or 3% used for basic research; about 75% went for development. Profit-making organizations had done most of dod’s r&d during the 10 yrs., increasing from about 50% in 1956 to 65% in 1965. The report added: “On the other hand, the relative share of Defense research and development performed intramurally decreased each year from ahout 40% in 1956 to 21% in 1963, but an increase to 25% was expected in 1965. . . .” (nsf Rpt. 65-13) • Experimental model isotopic thruster was tested at AEC Mound Laboratory, using heat from radioactive decay of polonium 210.

March 1965
March 1: NASA Administrator James E. Webb sent a letter to the House and Senate space committees outlining major reprograming of funds planned by NASA during the remainder of fy 1965. Webb said $13 million had been allocated to large solid rockets in fy 1965 and nothing in the following year “due to the President’s decision not to include funds in the NASA ’66 budget.” Close-out costs for the large solids would amount to $8.5 million in addition to the $13 million already earmarked “and would yield no technical confirmation of the planned objectives.” By adding another $5.3 million, “bringing the fy ’65 funding to $26.8 million,” nasa would “carry the Phase I program through to completion.” Phase I called for the manufacture and firing of two “half-length” rockets 78 ft. long and 260 in. in diameter. Additional close-out funds were also granted to the other programs not included in the fy ’66 budget: $2.15 million for Snap-8; $3 million for the M-l engine. (Text; NASA Auth.

• USAF conducted first inland Minuteman ICBM flight test, launching the missile from a silo near Newell, N. Dak. (M&R, 3/8/65)
March 1—3: The aiaa Unmanned Spacecraft Meeting was held in Los Angeles.
Maj. Gen. 0. J. Ritland, afsc’s Deputy Commander for Space, said in address that focus on manned space events often caused us to lose sight of the numerous space missions adequately performed by unmanned spacecraft. Although much of unmanned spacecraft activity had directly supported manned missions, “unmanned space technology has benefitted only indirectly from manned space effort.” He predicted that future manned missions might reverse this relationship and cited the objectives of the USAF Mol program as an effort to strengthen and expand technology for all space programs. Mol program would develop technology to improve manned space capability; dem-
onstrate servicing by man of large structures in space; conduct basic scientific and general technological manned experimentation; determine biological response of man in space for extended periods. General Ritland said: “With a laboratory in space, astronaut-scientists or engineers can assemble, test, and observe the operation of many subsystems or components in the actual space environment. They can observe equipment failures on the spot and will be able to make necessary replacements or repairs. I have spent many hours . . . looking over space flight data—attempting to determine exactly what failed and why it failed. The time is near when we can overcome many of these frustrations and uncertainties by use of the astronaut to answer such questions or to relay data to the ground for detailed analysis.” (afsc Release)
Discussing future requirements for military satellite communications systems, Samuel P. Brown, Technical Director, U.S. Army Satellite Communications Agency, said: “The feasibility of gaining significant improvements in this area appears very good based on the lessons learned from the SYNCOM spin stabilized satellite and the approaches planned for the DOD’s Initial Defense Communications Satellite Project and NASA’s Applications Technology Satellite Program. From these and other programs is expected to evolve techniques for spacecraft stabilization which will permit the increase of satellite antenna gains by an order of magnitude.” (Text)
NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Sciences and Applications Edgar M. Cortright said the reason for a civilian and a military space program lay in fundamental differences in the respective roles of NASA and dod: “nasa’s role is to explore and exploit space for peaceful purposes. The DOD’s role is to.stay prepared to defend the United States and its allies, operating in any medium that furthers this end. The present space program with its great breadth would never have evolved under the DOD, which must necessarily devote its full attention to its awesome military responsibilities. . . .
“Fortunately, the two space programs are mutually supporting and blend together quite well. They use common equipment . , . and draw on the same scientific and industrial base . . . numerous projects are of great mutual interest. Top management in both agencies devotes substantial effort to insure close cooperation and to minimize duplication.” (Text)
JPl’s Dan Schneiderman, project manager for NASA’s Mariner program, told aiaa delegates that data from MARINER iv’s solar plasma probe, which ceased normal functioning ten days after the Nov. 28, 1964, launching, had become understandable to scientists through analysis of a component failure in the plasma probe. Telemetry from a second instrument indicated that a portion of the ionization chamber experiment, which measured radiation in space, was not operating properly. Schneiderman said the new failure was in the Geiger-Mueller tube. Schneiderman estimated that based on nitrogen consumption to date, there was enough gas available to keep mariner IV stablized for about six years. He said there had been no loss of lock with Canopus since a special command was transmitted to the probe Dec. 17,1964. (nasa Release 65-73)
March 1-3: The first NASA University Program Review Conference in Kansas City, Mo., assembled over 400 university representatives interested in learning how their institutions could qualify for NASA grants for space-related research or expand present programs. Dr. Thomas L. K. Smull, Director of the NASA Office of Grants and Research Contracts, reported that 200 universities were participating in the program, that some of the grants were for specific projects, some in university sustaining programs, and others for the support of predoctoral candidates. He said that while NASA was “mission oriented,” its job was not limited to putting a man on the moon: “Its objective is the expansion of human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and space. One problem is how the academic community can communicate with nasa.” (McCoy, Kansas City Star, 3/1/65)
In a luncheon address, Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, urged educators not to strangle “the holy curiosity of inquiry.” He said the success of the U.S. space program depended largely on “formation of ideas by individuals working as individuals in universities.” (Text) Sen. Stuart Symington (D-Mo.) told the Conference that the U.S. must “widen the scope of man’s imagination, trample rough-shod over intellectually inhibiting barriers and stimulate to their fullest potential the mental powers of young and reasonably young Americans if the United States were to achieve and maintain preeminence in space.” Symington emphasized the need for communication of new knowledge.

March 2: Two seconds after lift-off, NASA’s Atlas-Centaur 5, carrying a dummy Surveyor spacecraft, exploded and burned on Launch Pad 36-B at Cape Kennedy. Failure occurred when two of the three Atlas engines shut off simultaneously due to closing of a fuel-line valve. The 150-ton, 108-ft. rocket rose three ft. from the pad, then fell back to the ground and exploded. Although burning propellant cov-
ered most of the launch complex, no injuries to personnel were reported. Damage to the launching pad was estimated at $5 million.
Objectives of the Atlas-Centaur test had been to test the ability of its guidance system and hydrogen-powered second stage to send a payload the size of the 2,150-lb.

•	In a letter of explanation to Congress, NASA discussed priorities in the
fy 1966 budget: “. . . As the President pointed out when he submitted the budget to the Congress, ‘It is a budget of priorities. It provides for what we must do, but not for all we would like to do.’ In assessing priorities and the most urgent national needs, the 260-inch solid propellant rocket program, the M—1 liquid hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine capable of providing l1/: million pounds of thrust, and the snap-8 nuclear electric power generating system to provide 35 kilowatts of electrical power in space could not be supported in the Fiscal Year 1966 budget.
“. . . [nasa] is, therefore, preparing plans for reprogramming Fiscal Year 1965 funds so as to logically phase out these program activities in such a way as to obtain as much technical information as is possible for future use. . . . Every effort is being made to achieve the greatest possible benefit from the funds already invested.” (Text)
*	Prof. Thomas Gold, Cornell Univ. astronomer, discussing RANGER
viii photographs in an interview with John Lear, World Book Encyclopedia Science Service, Inc., suggested that long, narrow rills and irregular depressions could be caused by moon’s surface collapsing into crevasses opened by the movement of a glacier hidden beneath lunar dust. He attributed gently rounded shapes to a shifting of small particles by electrical forces which, on earth, were inhibited by atmosphere. Concerning the manned expedition, Gold indicated: “The presence of ice oceans could give rise to many problems. But once these were solved, the ice itself could be mined and used to make hydrogen for fuel for rockets returning to Earth.” Referring to the electrically-charged particles: “Many particles would be dislodged mechanically by the landing of a spacecraft or the footstep of a man. Once loose, the dust would jump in response to electrical attraction or repulsion. If particles landed on the astronaut’s visor, brushing wouldn’t remove them but would instead intensify the electrical charges affecting their behavior.” Dr. Gold recommended more re-
search on possible control of these electrical forces. (Lear, Houston Chron., 3/2/65; Ind. Star, 3/7/65; wbe Sci. Serv.)

•	In a Christian Science Monitor editorial, Leonard Schwartz posed the
problem of “how the capability represented by manned orbiting space stations can be used to enhance national security and promote peaceful-scientific uses of outer space.” Schwartz suggested formation of an inspection agency—International Space Patrol—to neutralize military potential represented by manned space stations and to ensure usage of outer space for peaceful purposes only. He pointed out that Vice President Humphrey, one of the first proponents of an arms control agency and an international space agency, was now Chairman of National Aeronautics and Space Council, on which sat the Secretaries of Defense and State and administrators of AEC and NASA. This position provided him with “an appropriate vantage to supervise their arms control capabilities in order to reach a national decision which would reconcile control with security and scientific use of outer space.” (CSM, 3/2/65, 4)
March 2-3: In testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology, Edmond C. Buckley, Director of nasa’s Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, said that during 1965, data processing facilities would handle 70,000,000 data points per day and that there would be an increase to 200,000,000 data points per day in 1966. He continued: “In fiscal year 1966, effort under this category will be directed toward developing and evaluating techniques for building up the existing telemetry data reduction capability to match the increasing requirements. In order to reduce this tremendous amount of data in an efficient and reliable manner, new techniques must be evaluated for obtaining this additional capability.
“The heart of this prototype system is the Satellite Telemetry Automatic Reduction System (Stars). The development program for this system was initiated in prior years and is planned to continue through fiscal year 1968. The Stars equipment presently includes automatic editing, decommutation, and calibration of the telemetry data. Functions in addition to these will be included in the prototype equipment as the developmental subsystems become available. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 1-87)

March 4: NASA’s OGO I had received ground-administered “shock treatments” to correct faulty inverter. Continued malfunctioning of inverter, which supplied power for rotation of solar panels to maintain proper angle to the sun, would have shortened OGO i’s lifetime for lack of electric power. All other systems were functioning normally except attitude control. OGO I was still spin-stabilized in orbit; apparently horizon scanners were obscured by experiment boom only partially deployed. 19 of the 20 scientific experiments were returning usable scientific data, (nasa Release 65-75)

In addition to their direct value as new information, the subtle significance of these pictures toward increasing the value of other astronomical data is perhaps worthy of mention, as it may not be recognized generally. It is interesting to note how the information presented in the high resolution Ranger pictures has sent scientists scurrying back to the files of photographic plates taken years before to discover features which have remained unnoticed throughout the years. Some new interpretations of long recognized features have also been made possible by the close-up look obtained by Ranger.” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 56-111)

Manned Spacecraft Center, Rep. Olin Teague (D-Tex.) said he thought U.S. had about a 50-50 chance of landing a man on the moon by 1970 “if we get the money for our space team.” Teague felt that America was ahead of Russia in development of scientific programs in space, but Russia was ahead in development of large boosters. Rep. Robert Casey (D-Tex.) stressed that the program would be considered a success even if 1970 schedules were not met. Rep. George Miller (D—Calif.), Chairman of House Science and Astronautics Committee, said that in 50 to 100 years, “people won’t care if we made it in this decade, if the program itself is successful.” Dr. Robert R.

•	In testimony before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space
Sciences, on “the status, management, and prospects of the aeronautical and space program,” nasa Administrator James E. Webb said: “The progress during this period in the space program has been made possible by the cooperative efforts of many organizations and people. Ninety-four per cent of our work during Fiscal Year 1964
was conducted by American industry and involved a total of about
380,000	people in industry, universities, research institutes, and government installations. Almost 250,000 separate procurement transactions were initiated during this time.
“. . . the past year saw the continued strengthening of the coordination and the mutual support between nasa and the dod in space and aeronautics. The Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board has continued to be an effective medium for formal coordination. During 1964 NASA and the DOD developed procedures for the coordination of the space science programs; a national program in satellite geodesy was established by the dod, nasa, and the Department of Commerce: a standardized basis for reporting space and aeronautical sciences research and technology information has been adopted; a joint NASA-dod study was conducted to determine the launch vehicles needed to meet projected requirements during the next decade; a joint study was conducted of the current and planned lifting reentry vehicle research and development programs; the needs of NASA, the Air Force, and the Federal Aviation Agency were incorporated into an expanded flight research program utilizing the xb-70 aircraft to confirm theoretical and wind tunnel data on supersonic flight vehicles.
“All of this, Mr. Chairman, of course, is under an umbrella of policy followed closely by the [National Aeronautics and] Space Council. ...”	'
Commenting on the Soviet space program, Webb said: “Our rapid rate of advance and the success we have achieved already has, we believe, denied the USSR many of the benefits and many of the options which the Soviets expected their space program to provide as a part of their forward thrust toward world domination. However, there is every evidence, on the basis of their activity during the past three years, that the Russians intend to maintain a vigorous effort in space, and, in fact, that their activities may be further increased. During 1963 and 1964 more Soviet spacecraft were put in earth orbit or deep space than in the six previous years combined. The number placed in orbit last year was double that of the year before. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 13-50)
March 8: NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Hugh L. Dryden reported on the status of NASA cooperation with the Soviet Union in testimony before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: “Let me review where we stand. Of three projects agreed to in 1962, the only one completed is that which involved communications tests with Echo II. . . .
“The second project—joint mapping of the geomagnetic field—is at the stage of exchanging ground-based magnetic observations ... we are now acquiring data that was not previously available in the United States. . . .
“In the third project—for the coordination of meteorological satellite launchings and the establishment of a link for exchange of data— our prime purpose was and remains a sharing of the cost of providing weather satellite service and the exchange of satellite data. ... we are . . . exchanging conventional data over the link, which ... is financed on a 50-50 basis. I look forward for a meeting soon with Academician Blagonravov which will afford opportunity to review this
exchange and the prospects of satellite data exchange. ... a recent check shows the U.S. sending surface data for more stations than it receives but receiving upper air data for more stations than it sends. In sum, the present exchange is considered by the Weather Bureau to improve the quality of forecasts by our national weather services since it makes more data available in time for such forecasts than was the case prior to establishment of the link.” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 50-76)
March 8: NASA Associate Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., discussing the management of nasa’s aeronautics and space effort before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, said: “. . . our performance in terms of data returned is perhaps the most succinct evidence of success. The volume of information brought back from space in 1964 averaged 57 million data points per day in comparison with a previous high of some 6 million data points per day. This indicates not only more advanced instrumentation but also more reliable functioning of flight experiments. We averaged 54 working experiments throughout 1964, which represents an improvement of 35/7 over the 1963 average.
“We have achieved significant results in ground based experimentation, testing, aeronautical flights, and sounding rocket launchings. Work conducted in our wind tunnels continues to refine aircraft configurations for vertical takeoff and landing, supersonic transportation, and hypersonic flight. We are continuing to experiment with materials, fuels, turbines, injectors, and nozzles in order to improve the efficiency of air-breathing and rocket propulsion systems. The 3 successful power tests of the kiwi reactor demonstrated the applicability of nuclear energy to rocket propulsion. In 1964 we conducted 27 more flights of the x-15 aircraft, 19 of them over Mach 5, amassing data important to supersonic and hypersonic flight. In addition, we launched 131 successful sounding rockets from stations around the world to test new instrumentation and to obtain important scientific data in geophysics, astronomy, and meteorology. In the areas of manned space flight, the Apollo escape system has been successfully tested, and a boilerplate spacecraft checked out and flown on the Saturn I. A mock-up of the lunar excursion module has been approved. The Saturn IB and Saturn V ‘battleship’ upper stages have been successfully fired. The F-l engine has passed its flight rating test. This record was established by the hard work and careful attention to detail of the government-industry-university team charged with aeronautic and space exploration. This total team, numbering 380,000 people, is managed by the relatively small hard core NASA organization of less than 34,000.” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 76-114)

March 8: According to Missiles and Rockets, Dr. Joseph Shea, director of Apollo spacecraft program at NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, said Apollo spacecraft was having no weight problems. He explained that the current weight of 89,000 lbs. was under 90,000 lbs. goal and there was room for additional growth since Saturn V booster had increased estimated payload capability to 95,000 lbs. Weight of Lem was increasing in early development stage, but new evaluation stemming from nasa decision to make it as safe in terms of redundancy as command and service modules, could raise weight from 29,500 lbs. to 32,000 lbs. Shea commented that a stable baffled injector had been selected for service module’s propulsion system and it was currently undergoing qualification test series. Recent tests of heatshield in reentry tests with Scout (Aug. 18, 1964) achieved high total heat of 250 Btu’s per square foot—about 80'/< of the heat expected to be encountered during return from moon.

•	Prompted by results of the experiments of Dr. Frank A. Brown, Jr.,
Northwestern Univ. biology professor, NASA and Northwestern Univ. scientists were studying a plan to orbit a potato around the sun in an attempt to prove whether man could survive in long trips in space. Dr. Brown had concluded that rhythmic patterns of wakefulness and sleep, glandular activity, cellular respiration, and all other biological cycles of most live organisms were timed by biological clocks outside the organism, not inside. The three primary forces
were day-night changes and temperature, atmospheric, and pressure fluctuations.
For ten years, Brown had kept potato tubers under constant pressure and temperature and in constantly dim light, yet they continued to fluctuate at same rate and time as potatoes planted in Illinois and they detected atmospheric pressure changes. Brown concluded that “something is getting thru to the isolated potatoes to tell them what the weather is outside. It could be the earth’s magnetic or electric fields or radiation, since they all observe a 24-hour pattern geared to the rising and setting sun, but we are not sure.
“. . . biological clocks are necessary to keep a living system a coordinate, living, functioning whole. If the clocks are stopped, the organism may go beserk and die.” If the orbiting potato were to die within 90 days, it would indicate that a 24-hour rhythm was vital. (Kotulak, Chic. Trib., 3/9/65)

•	Harold B. Finger, Director of NASA Nuclear Systems and Space Power
and Manager of the aec-nasa Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, discussed nasa’s electric thrustor program in testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology: “We conducted the first successful flight test of an electric rocket engine in July, using the SERT 1 spacecraft. This flight demonstrated that ion beam neutralization will take place satisfactorily in space and, therefore, eliminated the only uncertainty regarding the basic feasibility of successful space operation. A second major accomplishment was the design, fabrication, and test of a 30 kilowatt thrustor. This thrustor is 10 times larger than previous ion engines, and demonstrates that we are successfully developing the engineering relations required to build the mega-watt size thrustors needed for spacecraft prime propulsion.”
Discussing nuclear propulsion programs, he said: “1964 was a year of significant progress in the Nuclear Rocket Program. It was marked by the successful completion of the kiwi series of reactor development experiments and the successful initiation of the nerva reactor testing. These reactor experiments, coupled with work in other portions of our Nuclear Rocket Program, provide assurance that the graphite core nuclear rocket can be available to fulfill its role as the next major space propulsion system.
“Of particular significance in 1964 was the successful demonstration of the adequacy of the reactor structural design, the elimination of reactor structural vibrations, full power reactor operation for over ten minutes at an altitude equivalent specific impulse of about 750 seconds, a rapid automatic startup, the ability to restart the rocket reactor, the determination of the effect of a maximum reactor power excursion, and the neutronic investigation of two rocket reactors located side-by-side as would be necessary in clustered engine configurations. . . .
“During this year emphasis will be placed upon extending our reactor technology to higher temperature, longer duration, and higher power while we proceed as rapidly as possible to close coupled nuclear rocket engine system testing. We face this task of developing nuclear rocket technology including component, subsystem, and engine system work, with a confidence that is based on the solid accomplishments in our reactor development program and with the knowledge that the technology we are developing will provide the propulsion capability that will ultimately be required for extensive space exploration.” (Testimony; NASA Auth.

•	Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator, speaking in Minneapo-

It is true that this accelerated growth in science and technology is essential to the on-going development of space capability, but of deeper significance is the complex dynamic interaction between science, technology, and space exploration, which is essential to the growth of science, technology, and space exploration. In this case, as in the cases previously cited, to use an analogy from bacteriology, there has to be a nutrient solution (money and employment opportunities) to feed the scientific and technological effort, and as soon as this environment is provided, many latent efforts in science and technology begin to assert themselves and move forward.
“I believe that this interpretation of certain aspects of the space program is more significant and meaningful than the current concepts of technology utilization and technological spinoff as incidental or serendipitous benefits of space exploration.” (Text)

March 16: Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, told the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications that NASA had an obligation to make information gained from space exploration available to the public. He continued: “To help achieve this, a National Space Science Data Center was established at GSFC in April
1964.	. . .
“The Data Center is responsible for the collection, organization, indexing, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of all scientific data resulting from experiments in space and the upper atmosphere. Since
its establishment the Data Center has begun: (1) to maintain a continuing inventory of data from sounding rockets and spacecraft; (2) to acquire data generated by spacecraft previously launched; (3) to collect selected ground correlative data; and (4) to produce the announcement publications which support its functions.
“In anticipation of the need for this facility, NASA has established a line item in the Physics and Astronomy budget, Data Analysis, of three million dollars in FY 1966. Of this, 600 thousand dollars is for the operation of the Data Center and 2.4 million dollars is for analysis of data from a flight experiment under the flight project. After the initial results have been published by the Principal Investigator and the data are placed in the data center, the additional analyses of these data will be funded from Data Analysis funds on the basis of proposals from competent scientists throughout the Nation . . . This approach is expected to . . . encourage them to use all of the available information in their theoretical research.”
Dr. Newell discussed NASA’s orbiting observatory program: “The primary reason for . . . solar studies is to meet the overall NASA objective to expand human knowledge of space phenomena. . . .
“oso-c [Orbiting Solar Observatory-C] is the next spacecraft to be launched and it is undergoing final testing at this time. On 30 May a solar eclipse of unusually long duration will occur. Every effort is being made to launch oso-c prior to this event so that two oso’s, with complementary payloads, can be operating and transmitting unique data on the solar radiation at the time of the eclipse.”
He said that the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (Ogo) program would make a major contribution to our understanding of earth-sun-environment relationships and that although OGO I had not functioned as planned “it has proven that the basic spacecraft design is adequate and that large numbers of experiments can be integrated and operated from a single satellite. Furthermore, should OGO I continue to transmit data for a reasonable period, it is expected that the results will contribute substantially to studies of the Earth-Sun relationships.
“Investigation of the OGO i failure indicated there was no common cause for failure, but as a result of the investigation, design modifications and additional tests are planned for future OGO spacecraft. The modifications include: (1) relocation of the horizon scanner and certain boom appendages to assure a clear field of view for the horizon scanners; (2) the use of a new type development spring and the addition of separate appendage ‘kick-off’ springs; and (3) the relocation of the omnidirectional antenna.” (Testimony; NASA Auth.

March 16: The communications blackout problem was discussed by Dr. Hermann H. Kurzweg, NASA Director of Research, Office of Advanced Research and Technology, in testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology: “One of the phenomena that occurs in gases at high temperatures is ionization, that is, electrons are torn away by the highspeed collisions of the gas atoms and molecules. . . . The free electrons, produced by the high temperatures in the shock layer around a reentry vehicle, interfere with and block the propagation of radio signals. . . . This effect produces the communications-blackout
problem. To understand what is going on and to eliminate, or at least minimize this communication difficulty, one must be able to calculate the distribution of free electrons about the body in order to predict when the plasma sheath will become opaque for certain radio frequencies. This calculation cannot be made until the flow field (temperature, density, pressure and velocity) about the body is known. A significant part of the fluid physics program is concerned with the investigations of flow fields. The results of these studies also give us better information on the heat transfer to reentry bodies.
“As a possible remedy for the communications blackout, we are studying the characteristics of various gases, called electrophylic gases, which have the unique property of capturing free electrons. Such a gas, which effectively reduces the electron concentration when injected into the flow, might solve the problem. . . . This work is tied closely with the work on radio attenuation going on at the Langley Research Center and the technique is being adapted to test a variety of fluids suggested by the work at Langley.” (Testimony; 1966 NASA Auth.

March 16: At the dedication of a new laboratory at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in memory of rocketry pioneer Dr. Robert H. Goddard, afsc Commander General Bernard A. Schriever said that Dr. Goddard’s writings still provided guidance to 1965 rocket men. General Schriever said the nation had made significant strides since Goddard conducted his first successful rocket launch 39 years ago. “His booster and its payload reached an altitude of 41 feet and traveled 184 feet before it impacted after a flight lasting about 21/; seconds. By contrast, the first two-man Gemini orbital space shot scheduled for later this month will reach several hundred miles into space for three orbits. . . .
“The Air Force Titan n booster and the Gemini capsule stand almost 110 feet—over twice the altitude achieved by Dr. Goddard’s historic rocket.”

March 17: Discussing the need for sustaining engineering funds for Centaur starting in fy 1966, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell testified before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Subcommittee on Space Sciences and Applications: “A preliminary study and design phase is being initiated by NASA this Fiscal Year [for adaptation of the Centaur to the Saturn ib]. The primary mission for this vehicle is the Voyager. Initial studies indicate this vehicle is capable of launching a payload to Mars in excess of 8000 pounds during all of the opportunities in the 1970’s. Generally, the modifications necessary to create this stage combination are not particularly difficult. They do represent a large engineering effort, but there is nothing apparent at this time which indicates that new technologies will be required. The Centaur will be mounted, along with the Voyager, inside a fairing the size of the Saturn (260-inch diameter). By constructing this size fairing the technical problems associated with adaptation of the Centaur to this new booster are significantly reduced and the diameter required for all of the Voyager missions is obtained.”
Dr. Newell described NASA’s sustaining university program as an effort “to broaden the national research base in areas of importance to the national space effort and increase our capability to replenish continually the reservoir of basic knowledge. . . .
“In response to the continuing manpower requirements, NASA conducts a predoctoral training program, under which grants are made to universities to select and train outstanding students in space-related fields. Specialized training for selected students offers them identification with the national space effort, and involves them directly in the new programs of the space age. . . .
“At the present time, about 1,957 students are in training at 131 institutions. The disciplines represented by these 1,957 students are distributed as follows: physical sciences, 51 percent; engineering, 37 percent; life sciences, 8 percent; behavioral sciences, 4 percent ... In September 1965, about 1,275 new students will begin their three years of study and research as NASA predoctoral trainees. At that time, 142 institutions, located in every state in the union, will be participating. With the proposed budget of $25 million for fiscal year 1966, about 1,300 new students would enter the program. Consequently, the NASA goal of an output of 1,000 Ph.D.’s per year will not be reached before fiscal year 1968 or fiscal year 1969 ... Of the students participating to date, 40 trainees have received their Ph.D. degrees. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 634—35)

March 18: U.S.S.R.’s voskhod ii, manned by pilot Col. Pavel Belyayev and co-pilot Lt. Col. Aleksey Leonov, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Tass reported. The spacecraft set an altitude record, reaching an apogee of 495 km. (309 mi.)—higher than any manned spacecraft had flown. Other orbital data: perigee, 173 km. (108 mi.); inclination, 65°; period, 91 min.
During the second orbit, Lt. Col. Leonov, clad in a spacesuit with “autonomous life support system,” stepped into space, moved about five meters from the spacecraft (tethered by a cable), and successfully carried out prescribed studies and observations: he examined the outer surface of the spacecraft; turned on a film camera; carried out visual observations of the earth and outer space: took horizontal, vertical, and somersaulting positions; and returned safely to the spacecraft. Tass said: “Outside the ship and after returning, Leonov feels well.” He spent about 20 min. in conditions of outer space, including 10 min. free-floating in space. Entire procedure was carried out under control of Col. Belyayev, with whom continuous communication was maintained. A television camera fixed to the side of voskhod ii relayed pictures of the maneuver to Soviet ground stations.
Biotelemetric data indicated that both cosmonauts had satisfactorily withstood the orbiting and the transition to weightlessness: the pulse rate of Belyayev and Leonov was 70—72 beats a minute and the respiration rate 18-20 a minute. All spacecraft systems were functioning normally. Tass said voskhod ii would complete at least 13 orbits of the earth.

Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Sciences and Applications by nasa Associate Administrator Dr. Homer E. Newell: “Results recently submitted by the U.S. and U.S.S.R. from flights up to five days in length indicate that long term space flight may
have several important and serious physiological and behavior effects upon the performance and well being of man that need to be investigated further. There were changes in the circulation system, in the biochemical characteristics of the blood and urine, and in the electroencephalogram indices, all pointing to a need for more detailed investigations. The results from the Biosatellite studies will have broad application to long term, manned space flight, including manned space stations and lunar and planetary bases.
“Prolonged manned flights may involve changes similar to those observed after 10 days of strict bed rest on the ground. These are moderate losses of bone minerals such as calcium, particularly in the vertebrae; loss of muscle tone and physical capability; certain cardiovascular changes; and metabolism in general. The effect of continued sensory deprivation on behavior and performance is unknown.
“Biosatellite experiments are of both scientific and practical importance and extremely profitable to investigate. We do not presently have sound theoretical bases for making precise quantitative (and in some cases qualitative) predictions of what we expect to happen. It is, therefore, important to carry out Biosatellite studies of suitable duration to critically demonstrate and test the effects of weightlessness on living organisms.”
Outlining approaches to the search for extra-terrestrial life in nasa’s bioscience programs, Dr. Newell testified: “(a) An attempt is being made to synthesize models of primitive single-celled organisms in the laboratory. . . .
“(b) The physical environments of the planets are being studied and characterized by instruments from the Earth, from high altitude balloons and from planetary fly-bys. . . .
“(c) Living Earth organisms are being grown under simulated planetary environmental conditions. . . .

•	A spacesuit that would enable man to leave his spacecraft was
discussed by Soviet doctor Vladimir Krichagin in a commentary for Tass written before the voskhod ii flight: “It is in fact a miniature hermetic cabin which consists of a metal helmet with a transparent visor, a multi-layer hermetic suit, gloves, and specially designed footwear. The spacesuit has its own power circuitry feeding communications, and a system of pickups of physiological functions ... It is impossible to create atmospheric pressure within the suit because it would then inflate as a football . . . and the man would turn into a statue unable to bend his legs and arms . . . the air pressure inside the spacesuit should be at least 0.4 atmospheres ... It was established that prolonged (over one hour) respi-
ration in pure oxygen literally washes nitrogen out of the tissues of the body and then the pressure can be safely reduced. It was . . . possible to free a man in the spacesuit from . . . the immobilizing effect of an ‘inflated football’. . . .
“There must be a steady supply of pure oxygen for the cosmonaut in spacesuit . . . his body has to ‘breathe’ and . . . give off up to 300 kilo-calories [every hour].
“. . . the spacesuit has a special airconditioning system through which room temperature air is pumped into the spacesuit. This air carries away excess heat of the organism and skin-exuded moisture.
“To protect man in space from . . . heat . . . and cold . . ., the spacesuit is covered by thermal insulation layer and coated with a light color that deflects heat rays ... In these spacesuits of the ventilation type . . . used air is injected into the environment.
“[In] spacesuits of the . . . regenerating type . . . the available air and hydrogen supply circulates from the spacesuit to a generating device and back. This device on the suit’s surface removes carbon dioxide and excess moisture from the ‘spent’ air . . . replenishes oxygen supply and cools off gases to a preset temperature.
“This spacesuit may be used for prolonged work in space and for landing on the lunar surface.” (UPI, Rosenfeld, Wash. Post, 3/19/65, 1, 2; Tanner, NYT, 3/20/65, 1, 3)

• Vice Adm. Hyman G. Rickover (usn) urged Congress to approve the construction of a new type of nuclear reactor that he said was vital to the welfare of the United States and perhaps the whole world. Adm. Rickover said the reactor—which he himself conceived—was called a “seed-blanket” reactor, would employ thorium as the major fuel and would produce more fuel than it consumed. It would run about nine years on one fuel charge. Reactors of this type—costing more than $263 million for the initial one—could extend the fuel resources of the United States by several hundred years and also produce electricity economically, he said.
Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, testified that aec had signed a memorandum of understanding with the state of California for the development and construction of the proposed $263 million prototype, and that whereas present “lightwater” reactors tapped only 1 to 2 per cent of the energy available in either uranium or thorium, the proposed reactor “will demonstrate technology which is expected to provide means for ultimately making available for power production about 50 per cent of the potential energy in
thorium—which represents an energy source many times larger than that of the known fossil-fuel [coal and oil] reserves.” Admiral Rickover said the proposed power device would have more than twice the electrical-generating capacity of any United States central power station. (ap, Ayr, 3/19/65, 12)

March 19: Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, made his first address on the U.S. space program at the Goddard Memorial Dinner sponsored by the National Space Club in Washington, D.C. He said: “1 intend to be an advocate of a dynamic space program—a program which will succeed in reaching to goals we have set—and one which will see new goals—one that can see beyond the moon and into fields where we can only speculate about the knowledge awaiting us.”
The Vice President spoke briefly about the Soviet Union’s VOSKHOD II flight: “It is well for us from time to time to take stock—to take a careful look—in order to see how we are making out in comparison with our main competitor. The facts are that we do have very strong competition and hence we have another big reason for a major space effort—namely, prudence. Our national security alone would suggest reason enough for us to strive for absolute leadership in space exploration.”
Humphrey pointed out that the Soviets remained ahead in propulsion for their rockets, while the U.S. continued to lead “in the directly useful fields of weather reporting, navigation, and communications.” He continued: “The Soviets clearly have an advantage in studying the effects of space environment on human beings. . . . We can salute the Russian achievements . . . but we would be foolish if we did not understand the military implications of Soviet space science as well as our own.
“Each Russian shock has produced action here. But a mature nation should not need shock treatment. We are a peaceful nation . . . but we would ignore the real interests of the free world if we diminished our military efforts in space.”

• “Present-day Americans are thinking, working, and risking to find ways, first to explore, and then to use, the new environment of outer space,” said NASA Administrator James E. Webb in an address to the New Mexico Chapter of the American Institute of Industrial Engineers in
Albuquerque. He continued: “. . . the exploration of space has brought a new force into the affairs and life of this Nation. Once more the American people confront a new environment—harsher, more demanding, more inspiring than any man has ever tried to enter before. ... We cannot yet foresee all the consequences of man’s entry into space. But the record of history is clear, that the mastery by one nation of a new environment, or of a major new technology, or the combination of the two as we now see in space, has always in the past had the most profound effects on all nations and on all the peoples of the earth.” (Text)
March 19: In an interview with Izvestia, one of the two directors of the Soviet space program, the “chief designer,” whose identity had never been revealed, said the voskhod ii program had called for Lt. Col. Leonov to spend “10 minutes outside the cabin” but that he could have stayed much longer. He said the weight and space saved by having two men aboard voskhod ii instead of three men, as on voskhod i, had been used to install a decompression chamber and related equipment. The designer said Leonov’s spacesuit was equipped with “duplicate systems” to ensure a high degree of reliability and that a bellows had been installed to allow bending of the torso, arms, and legs. Izvestia said in another article that Leonov’s spacesuit consisted of five layers: a heat reflecting layer outside; material for strength; airtight material; heat insulating material; and an inside layer containing a ventilation system.
The “chief theoretician,” joint director of the Soviet space program, told Izvestia that Col. Leonov’s venture into space had shown that future astronauts might find it easier to work in space than on earth. He said that “we shall yet live to see the day when orbiting platforms appear in space—resembling scientific research institutes in the earth’s upper atmosphere.” The theoretician was also quoted as saying that Leonov’s principal assignment had been to determine man’s reaction to “weightlessness in free space.” He told Tass: “We obtained in practice what we had visualized theoretically before.” (Tanner, NYT, 3/20/65, 1, 3)

March 20: President Johnson, asked during a press conference, “where does our space program stand in relation to the Soviets’ in the wake of their latest feat?” replied: “The Soviet accomplishment and our own scheduled efforts demonstrate, I think dramatically and convincingly, the important role that man himself will play in the exploration of the space frontier. The continuing efforts of both our program and the Russian program will steadily produce capability and new space activity. This capability, in my judgment, will help each nation achieve broader confidence to do what they consider they ought to do in space.
“I have felt since the days when I introduced the Space Act and sat studying Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2 that it was really a mistake to regard space exploration as a contest which can be tallied on any box score.
“Judgments can be made only by considering all the objectives of the two national programs, and they will vary and they will differ. Our own program is very broadly based. We believe very confidently in the United States that we will produce contributions that we need at the time we need them. For that reason, I gave Mr. Webb and his group every dollar in the Budget that they asked for a manned space flight.
“Now the progress of our program is very satisfactory to me in every respect. We are committed to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind. We stressed that in our hearings and our legislation when we passed the bill, and while the Soviet is ahead of us in some aspects of space, U.S. leadership is clear and decisive and we are ahead of them in other realms on which we have particularly concentrated.” (Transcript; Wash.

March 21: nasa’s ranger ix, equipped with six television cameras, was successfully launched toward the moon from Cape Kennedy by an Atlas-Agena B. After the Agena had carried the 800-lb. ranger ix into 115-mi.-altitude parking orbit with 17,500 mph orbital speed, the Agena engines were cut off. Second burn of the Agena lasted about 90 sec., increasing the velocity to about 24,525 mph and freeing ranger ix from the major pull of the earth’s gravity, ranger ix then continued on its 2*/2-day, 245,000-mi. trip to the moon. About 70 min. after launch, nasa announced the spacecraft had been commanded to deploy its solar panels that would convert solar energy to electrical power for its equipment.
Projected target was the crater Alphonsus, about 12° south of the moon’s equator, where gaseous emissions had been reported. On the day of impact, Alphonsus would be illuminated by slanting sunlight, producing long shadows and bringing out subtle surface features. The terminator—dividing line between the dark and sunlit portions of the moon—would be only 11° from Alphonsus.
Five hours after lift-off, nasa announced that ranger ix’s course was so accurate it would hit the moon only 400 mi. north of the crater target; an inflight maneuver would be executed later to correct this small course error, (nasa Release 65-25; Wash.

•	At a news conference reported by Soviet press, Col. Pavel Belyayev and
Lt. Col. Aleksey Leonov, the two-man crew of the Soviet spacecraft
voskhod ii, said they had sighted an artificial satellite during their Mar. 18 flight: “We shouted with surprise when we saw it slowly rotating about 800 meters [900 yards] from our ship.” Neither the satellite nor the orbit in which it was traveling was identified.
The cosmonauts related the part that each had played. Col. Belyayev had operated the controls of the decompression chamber through which his companion left the spacecraft, recorded Leonov’s pulse and respiration rate, and oriented the spacecraft so that Leonov was always in sunlight during the televised sequence transmitted to earth. Col. Leonov said that when he opened the hatch of the air lock after decompression, he was “struck by a flow of blindingly bright sunlight like an arc of electric welding.” The spacecraft was in its second orbit, passing over Kerch Strait. Space had an unexpected aspect, he said: “Ahead of me was black sky, very black. The sun was not radiant, just a smooth disc without an aureole. Below was the smooth-level earth. You could not tell it was a sphere, only by the fact that the round edge showed on the horizon.” The acrobatics tired Leonov, especially because of the effort required to move. He said that although the program required that he carefully wind the rope that had tethered him to the craft, he found it “a waste of time” and simply pulled it into the hatch. “The commander quickly closed the hatch cover and injected pressure into the air lock,” Leonov said.
Describing the manually controlled landing, Col. Belyayev said the controls were switched on in time and all systems had “worked without a hitch.” He said the spacecraft landed in the northern Ural mountains between two big spruce trees in snow 5-10 ft. deep. (Shabad, NYT, 3/23/65, 1,23)

March 22: In NASA fy 1966 authorization hearings before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, NASA Administrator James
E.	Webb testified: “Among the hard decisions and difficult choices which had to be made in the preparation of this budget was the decision to terminate the programs to develop the m—1 large liquid hydrogen fueled engine, the large 260-inch solid propellant motor, and the snap-8 nuclear electric power supply. The reduction in the requests for space technology activities amounting to about $18 million when compared with fiscal year 1965, results mostly from these terminations. However, as this Committee knows, there is pending before it notification of a plan to reprogram $16,950,000 of 1965 funds so that these projects can be carried forward into 1966 to appropriate developmental points at which important segments of the engineering data for which the projects were originally planned can be obtained for incorporation in our total bank of technological and engineering knowledge.”
Mr. Webb was questioned by Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D—Minn.) on when the first U.S. extravehicular activity was planned, and he replied: “Within the next year. We are not sure on which gemini flight we
will do it as yet.” Senator Mondale asked: “When do we plan our first rendezvous maneuver?” and Mr. Webb replied: “Within the next year, maybe the latter part of this year.” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 623, 663)
March 22: Testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astro-nautic’s Subcommittee on Space Sciences, NASA Associate Administrator Dr. Homer E. Newell said that since success of any program was measured by the nature of the data provided, nimbus i had more than achieved design objectives: “. . . during its three and one-half weeks of life, Nimbus took 12,137 individual frames of avcs pictures, an estimated 1,930 apt cycles, and over 6,880 minutes of heir data. Hurricanes Cleo, Dora, Ethel, and Florence were observed and Typhoons Ruby and Sally in the Pacific were located by this spacecraft. . . .
“The launch and successful operation of Nimbus I has proved the success of the basic Nimbus spacecraft design. It has also given NASA a better insight as to what additional modifications will be required in the system design for the next Nimbus flight. As mentioned previously, the primary limitation of the first Nimbus flight was the result of the failure of the Agena B vehicle to inject the spacecraft in the proper polar, near-circular orbit and the failure in the spacecraft solar paddle rotation mechanism. The first of these failures resulted in less than complete global cloud coverage and the second reduced spacecraft lifetime. . . .” (Testimony; NASA Auth. Hearings, 928-35)

It also has emphasized again that, unless some drastic changes are made, this history will be written primarily in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet with only an occasional U.S. footnote technically necessary. . . .
“All of this Soviet progress again emphasizes strongly the ultra-conservatism of the U.S. manned space flight program and the utter inadequacy of the tiny step-by-step approach that sounds so convincing when defending under-funded programs. This approach is sounding more and more idiotic in the face of Soviet space achievements. . . .
“Each Soviet manned space flight makes it clearer that the Russians are widening their lead over the U.S. in this vital area. It also makes it clear that the many billions the American people have poured willingly into our national space program for the purpose of wresting this leadership from the Soviets are not going to achieve that goal under the present management. . . .”	( Hotz, Av.

•	NASA Langley Research Center scientists Arthur L. Newcomb, Jr., Nelson
J. Groom, and Norman M. Hatcher reported their work on an infrared sensing instrument to help a spacecraft determine which way was up, at the IEEE national convention. The device described was sensitive to the difference between infrared radiation in space and that emitted by a planetary or lunar body; it employed a mechanically-driven system of mirrors to scan the region of space in which it was operating. Radiation gathered by the mirrors was focused into four germanium lenses, each containing a thermistor sensitive to infrared. When the scanning mirror crossed the horizon of a planet, the increase or decrease registered on the thermistor and generated an electronic signal that could be processed through a series of special circuits to provide a stabilizing or control command to the spacecraft.
The new sensor concept was expected to be useful for weather and communications satellites, as well as for space probes and other types of spacecraft. (LaRC Release)

•	Reasons for choosing the moon crater Alphonsus as the target for
RANGER ix were given by David Hoffman in an article in the New York Herald Tribune: “First, they are just plain curious. Rangers 7 and 8 photographed two lunar seas and taught scientists that all such ‘maria’ are pretty much the same. Now scientists want pictorial coverage of the moon’s rugged highlands.
“Alphonsus’ walls rise 7,000 to 10,000 feet above its crater floor, and in the basin thus formed astronomers have observed reddish gas seeping from the surface. The question, then, is whether Alphonsus is really a lunar equivalent of a live volcano.
“Second, some space experts believe Apollo astronauts, as they descend on the moon, may encounter an emergency. That emergency might force them down in the moon mountains instead of onto a flat lunar plain. Accordingly, NASA wants to know surface roughness of the smoothest part of the moon mountains.
“Third, there are some who believe the smoothest areas on the moon actually lie within the great craters (Alphonsus’ diameter is 70 miles). If this proves true, astronauts might select a crater floor as their touchdown point, assuming there is no volcanic activity.” (Hoffman, N.Y. Her. Trib., 3/23/65)

March 22: NASA’s actions in releasing foreign satellite information were criticized in a report by the House Committee on Government Operations, based on study by its Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee. Committee stated NASA had deleted from its biweekly Satellite Situation Report certain Soviet launches because they were designated as secret information by Norad. “nasa has not once challenged these security classifications, blindly accepting the military decision. . . .” Compounding the problem, NASA had “publicized the facts about Soviet failures [Sept. 15, 1962, letter from Administrator Webb to Senate and House space committees] after those facts had been carefully deleted from its routine report of satellite information.
“. . . NASA has ignored two clear requirements of law—the requirement for civilian control over nonmilitary space activities and the requirement for the fullest possible flow of public information. By yielding, automatically, to the military judgment on what the American people shall know about Soviet space activities, NASA fails to implement its legal mandate. By playing an on-again, off-again secrecy game, NASA tends to confuse the American public. . . .
“Therefore, the committee recommends that, in every possible instance consistent with the dictates of national security, NASA exercise its right to challenge military-imposed restrictions by requiring justification and, thus, carry out the mandate to keep the American people informed. . . .” (House Rpt. 197)

March 23: GEMIM m Astronauts John W. Young (foreground t and Virgil I. Grissom in spacecraft immediately prior to launch.
March 23: nasa’s gemini in spacecraft ('''Molly Brown*’). with Astronaut Virgil I, Grissom (Maj., i-'SAF I as command pilot and Astronaut John W. Young (LCdr., USN I as pilot, was successfully launched from Eastern lest Range on three-orbit GT-3 mission by a two-stage Titan ii.
Within six minutes after Jitt-olT. GEMIM ill and its two astronauts were injected into elliptical orbit with apogee. 224 km. (139 mi.l; perigee, 161 km. (100 mi.): period. 88 min. Speed of spacecraft was 16.600 mph. Toward the end of the first orbit. 93 min. after launching, the first maneuver was performed: Grissom fired two small thruster rockets that pushed ‘’backward*’ on the spacecraft, slow ing it down by about 45 mph. Lessened velocity caused GEMINI III to drop in altitude to a near-circular orbit with apogee. 169 km. (105 mi.): perigee, 158 km. <915 mi.). Second maneuver occurred during second orbit: Astronaut Grissom used the thrusters to turn the spacecraft broadside to its Right path. Then he gave a burst that pushed the craft about 1 50th of a degree from the original course; short bursts, fired rapidly, slowed the craft and he turned it Into a course nearly parallel to his original one. Third maueuvei came in the third orbit: Grissom fired the spacecraft thruster rockets, dropping into an orbit with perigee of 82 km. (52 mi. I. Manually controlling reentry, the astronauts turned the spacecraft's blunt end forward, ejected the
section carrying the retrorockets. Four hours and 53 min. after launching, gemini iii safely landed in the Atlantic Ocean off Grand Turk Island, considerably off target and some 50-60 mi. away from the recovery ship, Intrepid. Navy frogmen from hovering aircraft fastened a float around gemini hi. Original plans had called for the spacecraft, with the astronauts still inside, to be hoisted aboard the recovery ship and immediate medical checks made. When Grissom became seasick the men were picked up by helicopter and landed on the Intrepid; the spacecraft was recovered later.
The astronauts helped perform two experiments. One was the irradiation of human blood to test the combined effects on it of weightlessness and irradiation. The other was to squirt small jets of water into the plasma sheath that surrounded the spacecraft as it reentered the earth’s atmosphere, testing a theory that a fluid flowing through the ionized layer of atoms would permit radio signals to penetrate the communications blackout common to reentry.
Gemini officials said that, so far as was known, this was the first time a manned spacecraft had maneuvered in orbit, changing its orbital path, (nasa Release 65-81; nasa Transcript; Clark, NYT, 3/24/65, 1, 22; Simons, Wash. Post, 3/24/65; Bishop, WSJ, 3/24/65)
March 23: ranger ix underwent a midcourse correction maneuver at 7:03 a.m. est that would aim the spacecraft more accurately for impact on the moon crater Alphonsus on Mar. 24. The maneuver consisted of a series of radio signals that changed the spacecraft’s attitude and then, through a 31-sec. burn of a small jet engine, speeded up its flight by 40.6 mph. ranger ix was then 175,416 mi. from earth, traveling at 2,943 mph.
Newly estimated impact point was 12.9° south latitude and 2.3° west longitude—only four miles from the original target point of 13° south latitude and 2.5° west longitude. Before the correction maneuver, ranger ix was headed for a point about 400 mi. north of Alphonsus.
JPL Director Dr. William H. Pickering said during a press conference that the landing should be well out of the shadow of the towering peak in the center of Alphonsus—a possibility that had caused JPL scientists some concern since light was needed for the picture-taking.

The Soviets now have approximately the same number of scientists and engineers that we have. But every year they graduate an average of 200,000 scientific and technical students as compared with about 120,000 a year in this country. It is also worth noting that the number of scientific institutions in Russia has grown from about 3000 in 1957 to about 5000 in 1965.

above lmiar surface.
March 24; After transmitting 5.811 close-up lunar pictures to earth, ranger ix. traveling at f>.')77 mph, imparted the moon at 0:08 a.m. EST at 12.0° south latitude and 2.1° west longitude in the crater Alphonsus. The 10-ft,, 800-lb. spacecraft, last in the Ranger series, was only four miles off target. NASA had made real-time TV coverage available and the three major networks broadcast “live” pictures during the last ten minutes of ranger tx’s (light. First pictures, taken as the photographic probe was 1.300 mi. from the moon, had about the same degree of detail as telescopic views from earth. Those taken a few seconds before impact defined objects as small as 10 in, across, including close-ups of canal-like rilles on the floor of the crater and dimple-like depressions at points along the rilles.
Photographs shown on television were taken by the “B” camera, one of two wide-angle cameras used. Four narrow-angle cameras took other shots. Pictures were received on 85-ft. antennas at Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Goldstone Tracking Station in the Mojave Desert and recorded on both 35mm film and magnetic tape for detailed analysis. Simultaneously signals were relayed by microwave to the JPL laboratory in Pasadena where an electronic scan converter “translated” electronic impulses from the 1,152-lines-per-picture of the ranger IX signal system to the standard 500 lines of commercial television.
The Ranger program had begun inauspiciously in 1961 with a series of failures and near-misses. Rangers 1 and 2 had been designed to test the spacecraft and launch vehicle but were not injected into the desired orbit, ranger iii, iv, and v were to rough-land a seismometer package on the moon to record moon quakes, and to transmit closeup photos of the moon to earth by radio. None of the missions was successful, ranger vi, first of the reworked and redesigned spacecraft, impacted within 17 mi. of its point of aim—but its television system failed. On July 31, 1964, ranger vii successfully relayed to earth 4,316 high-quality close-up photos of the lunar surface, ranger viii, launched on Feb. 20, 1965, transmitted 7,137 pictures. Total number of photographs from ranger vii, viii, and ix was 17,267. (nasa Release 65-96; Sullivan, NYT, 3/22/65, 1; ap, Dighton, Wash.

March 24: A panel of scientists analyzed slides of the ranger ix lunar pictures at a post-impact press conference and noted that crater rims— some with level areas—and ridges inside the walls seemed harder than the plains but that floors of the craters appeared to be solidified volcanic froth that would not support a landing vehicle. Volcanic activity was inferred from indications that the moon had at least three types of craters not caused by meteorite impact.
Dr. Ewan A. Whitaker of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the Univ. of Arizona said parts of the highlands around the crater Alphonsus and ridges within it seemed harder and smoother than the dusty lunar plains. Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper of the same laboratory said of the crater: “It might well be better to make landings there.”
Most significant finding of ranger ix’s photographs, according to Dr. Eugene Shoemaker of the U.S. Geological Survey, was the smoothness of the crater walls and of the long ridges on the floor of the crater.
Dr. Harold Urey of the Univ. of California referred to black patches in the pictures which he said might be composed of graphite: “. . . these dark halo craters are due to some sort of plutonic activity beneath the surface of the moon. They do not look to me like terrestrial volcanoes. . . . They look like a unique lunar type of object.” Dr. Urey said a Soviet scientist had reported a red flare near a peak in Alphonsus and that analysis had indicated presence of a molecule with two carbon atoms. He said this was “a very curious situation because this molecule . . . does not escape from any known volcano” on earth, (nasa Transcript)
March 24: After watching televised pictures of the moon’s surface transmitted by ranger IX, President Johnson issued a congratulatory statement that said: “Ranger 9 showed the world further evidence of the dramatic accomplishments of the United States space team. Coming so close after yesterday’s Gemini success, this far-out photography reveals the balance of the United States space program.
“Steps toward the manned flight to the moon have become rapid and coordinated strides, as manned space maneuvers of one day are followed by detailed pictures of the moon on the next.
“I congratulate the scientists, the engineers, the managers—private contractors as well as Government—all who made this Ranger shot and the successes of its predecessors the great space advances that they have been.” (Text, Ayr, 3/25/65)

Interestingly enough, however, in marked contrast to the wide-open American procedure, they do not let the outside world have any look at either the launching or the landing of their spacemen. This furtiveness makes one wonder about the nature of their program and whether they’re really accomplishing as much as they claim to be.
“In any case, regardless of what the Russians are hiding, there can be no doubt that the Grissom-Young flight represents an important advance for the United States in the race to the moon. Technically, we are ahead of the Reds in many respects, and it is entirely possible that we’ll make lunar landings before them.” (Wash. Eve. Star, 3/24/65)
March 24: An editorial in the New York Herald Tribune referred to the U.S.-U.S.S.R. race for the moon: “The moon remains an elusive target, but it gets closer all the time. . . .
“Ideally, this should be a cooperative venture, enlisting the common efforts of the peoples of all nations; instead, so far at least, it is a race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Because it is a race; because space technology is, in major part, inseparable from military technology; because space prestige is, however illogically, a factor in the struggle to keep the earth free, we have to compete. NASA’s ambitious program of a manned Gemini flight every three months promises a vigorous competitive effort. But the American effort does not parallel that of the Soviets; each is giving priority to different techniques, and the comparative standings in the race are hard to measure. What is clear, however, is that the Grissom-Young flight has carried the American program a long way forward—and beyond that, and more importantly in the long perspective of history, it has brought closer the day when man, not American man or Soviet man, finally breaks the terrestrial bonds that hold him to his native planet.” (N.Y.

On the other hand, the Soviets lead in a number of areas with both propaganda and practical implications.
“. . . Thus, they have put into space the first satellite, the first living creature, the first man, the first woman, the first multi-man space ship and now the first man to step out of the capsule and into space itself. They also hold the world record for time in orbit, orbital distance, orbital weight lifted, and highest orbital altitude. . . .
“How will the Soviets use their space capabilities? ... we are interested. . . .”

March 25: At a press conference, Maj. Virgil I. Grissom (usaf) and LCdr. John W. Young (usn) described the three-orbit gt-3 flight of Mar. 23, as busy, exhilarating, near-perfect, and short on surprises. They said it was highly significant for future flight in space since it proved that a spacecraft could be maneuvered precisely, at will, and more independently of the ground than before. They said it also proved that man can eat and safely dispose of wastes as they will need to do on long flights.
Major Grissom suggested two possible reasons that the “Molly Brown” had undershot the target landing area: one was that something might have gone wrong during the final orbit change or when subsequently the braking rockets were fired to start the spacecraft’s descent; the other was that there might have been a miscalculation of the craft’s center of gravity, (nasa Transcript)

•	Kenneth Gatland, Vice-President of the British Interplanetary Society,
urged U.S.-U.S.S.R. cooperation in manned lunar exploration in New Scientist article. “. . . it seems we are faced with the ludicrous situation of the world’s two most powerful nations, each with massively expensive rival programmes, heading for a common objective which each proclaims is being pursued in the highest interests of peaceful scientific exploration.” A joint venture would have the advantage of providing for contingencies such as rescue of astronauts possibly stranded on the moon or in lunar orbit—a capability not included in Project Apollo. “This situation can only be satisfactorily resolved by the provision in lunar orbit of a second soft-landing vehicle and back-up crew capable of mounting an emergency rescue operation. To achieve this would require a specially adapted version of the craft already designed to soft-land astronauts.
“This is where the merit of US-Soviet cooperation lies for, as an international venture, a project to land men on the Moon would surely not be undertaken as envisaged in project Apollo; and certainly not with such rigid constraints on time. In all probability it would be planned as an operation rather than a solo mission, with logistic support from a second space vehicle placed in lunar orbit ahead of the main expedition. . . .
“The essential requirement in terms of the eventual lunar expedition is that launchings should be coordinated so that expedition components arrive in lunar orbit together. By the mid-1970’s, orbital rendezvous techniques should be well established with the ability of men to move between orbiting vehicles. An agreed crew could then descend to the lunar surface while another ship remains in reserve orbiting the Moon in case of need. Alternatively, a reserve vehicle might be landed, unmanned, in advance. . . .
“Although at this stage such ... [a combined lunar expedition] would have little influence on overall costs, it could mean a great deal to the safety of initial manned missions.
“Such a move would demand concessions on both sides. It would mean America abandoning her 1970 target date for placing men on the Moon, and while allowing Russia to keep her rocket secrets she would have to be prepared to reveal her programme for manned spaceflight. . . .” (New Scientist, 3/25/65, 774^76)

that voskhod ii had been scheduled to land after 16 orbits, but that there was an inaccuracy in “the solar system of orientation” that
prevented use of the automatic landing system. He said he then had to obtain radioed permission from the Soviet space center to land by manual control after the 17th orbit. The landing site was overshot “by a certain distance” Belyayev said without disclosing how much.
Belyayev said success of the gt-3 flight of Astronauts Virgil I. Grissom and John W. Young “was a national achievement of the United States.” He congratulated “the courageous American cosmonauts,” and said: “May the flights of both ours and American cosmonauts be dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the universe in the interests of science and for the good of all mankind.”
Belyayev said voskhod ii was capable of maneuvering in space as did the U.S. gemini iii but that this was not in the Soviet flight plan.
Leonov described time outside the ship saying “it is too early to call it a pleasant walk. It could not have been done without hard training.” He reported his small push on voskhod ii to move away from it after going out of the hatch started the spacecraft into slow rotation. In pulling himself back to the voskhod ii by his cable, Leonov disclosed he had yanked rather vigorously and had to put his hand out to avoid collision with the spacecraft.

During March: Asked in an interview for the San Diego Union if the U.S. would succeed in landing a man on the moon in this decade, Dr. Donald F. Hornig. special assistant to President Johnson for science and technology, said: “When you lay down a schedule, it says that if everything goes as I see it, making allowances for reasonable difficulties, this is what I’ll do. It’s a tight schedule and will take a lot of doing. We also have to acknowledge that unforeseen problems may arise. . . . When we started in 1961 on a nine-year program it was not wishful thinking but it was a purely paper exercise. We have slipped some on our schedules, but in a sense we have gained ground in that we have not run into any serious difficulties yet. We are now entering the hardest period of all, when the pieces begin to come out of the factory and have to be put together and tested.”
Answering a query if there would be a manned expedition to Mars one day, he said: “It would be harder than going to the moon. I don’t anticipate he will go soon. But we have started the unmanned exploration. The results may whet our appetite or may prove that conditions are so inhospitable that it isn’t worth the effort.” (San Diego Union, 3/7/65)

• A prototype Tiros weather satellite was donated to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air Museum by Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator, on behalf of NASA, in commemoration of the fifth anniversary of NASA’s tiros I launch.
Dr. Dryden said: “. . . nine experimental meteorological satellites of the Tiros series have been successfully launched and operated.
“Seldom, if ever, has a complex technological effort in its early phases returned such valuable dividends as this project. In the early stage Tiros was an Army project. When the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was created in 1958 it took over the development of the spacecraft.
“The United States Weather Bureau utilized the data from the very first experimental flight. The first Tiros had been in orbit only a few hours when it began transmitting to NASA ground stations cloud photographs of good quality. The Weather Bureau was quickly able to apply the pictures to its day-by-day forecasting. During the years since then, Tiros satellites have literally been working their way around the world, benefitting men everywhere by supplying previously unobtainable weather data. At this stage, it is impossible to estimate how many lives have been saved and how much property loss avoided through use of Tiros information, but the totals must already be substantial.”
David Arthur Davies, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, discussed international reaction to meteorological satellite developments, listing three main points: (1) “. . . the tremendous impact which this new means of observing the atmosphere has had upon the world scientific community. . . . [For instance,] it was the realization that the meteorological satellite was ... a turning point in the long history of man’s endeavors to improve his knowledge and understanding of his environment—the atmosphere” that led to the establishment of the World Weather Watch. (2) The impact of the meteorological satellite upon the United Nations. The “. . . impact of the tiros satellites was so great as to inspire the General Assembly of the United Nations to take the very unusual step of
adopting a resolution on a scientific question of this kind [Resolution 1721 on International Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space] and to maintain its interest from that time.” And, (3) “. . . the general feeling of gratitude and admiration towards the United States which the launching of tiros I and which the decision to distribute the data to all countries throughout the whole world engendered.”
Speaking at the ceremony, Dr. Robert M. White, Chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau, praised the Tiros program and said that the NASA-Weather Bureau Tiros Operational Satellite System (Tos), expected to be operational early next year, would modify a Tiros satellite similar to tiros IX to permit daily observation of clouds in the earth’s atmosphere. He added: “And one day we may even be using the moon as a base for establishing a weather station to monitor and study terrestrial weather.” Dr. White predicted continued NASA-Weather Bureau cooperation: (1) to further develop “satellite visual and infrared sensing devices for the indirect probing of the atmosphere”; (2) to “broaden the meteorological satellite system as a means of data collection”; and (3) to “pursue the use of synchronous satellites for weather observations.”
Dr. Morris Tepper, Director of Meteorological Programs in nasa’s Office of Space Sciences, recalled the launching of TIROS I: “It was a very exciting morning—waiting for my first countdown . . . someone fixed a leaky lox line at the launching pad by wrapping a wet rag around the leak and freezing it solid . . . The launch vehicle, the Thor-Able, performed exceptionally well. The spacecraft was placed into an exceptional orbit. The next question was—what would we see?
. . . And finally we had our picture—this first picture from TIROS I. Yes, there were clouds in it . . . The first three pictures were . . . carried to Dr. Glennan, the first Administrator of NASA, and finally we all trekked over to the White House and interrupted a Cabinet Meeting to show President Eisenhower the results of this remarkable space capability.” (Texts; nasa Release 65-102)

April 2: Summary report of NASA’s Future Programs Task Group, directed by Francis B. Smith of LaRC, was sent by NASA Administrator James E. Webb to the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences and House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Report presented “the results of studies made during 1964 to answer inquiries made by President Johnson as to criteria and priorities for space missions to follow those now approved for the decade of the 1960’s. . . .” It examined (1) conditions and constraints for future planning, (2) major capabilities existing and under development, (3) intermediate missions, and (4) long-range aeronautical and space developments. Report concluded:
“. . . The details of these new missions such as specific spacecraft designs and exact mission plans will, of course, be the subject of continued study. . . . Continued space exploration will be an evolutionary process in which the next step is based largely on what was learned from the experience of preceding research and flight missions. The pace at which these new programs will be carried out will necessarily depend upon many other factors, such as the allocation of budgetary and manpower resources and the changing National needs of the future.
“This study has not revealed any single area of space development which appears to require an overriding emphasis or a crash effort. Rather, it appears that a continued balanced program, steadily pursuing continued advancement in aeronautics, space sciences, manned
space flight, and lunar and planetary exploration, adequately supported by a broad basic research and technology development program, still represents the wisest course. Further, it is believed that such a balanced program will not impose unreasonably large demands upon the Nation’s resources and that such a program will lead to a preeminent role in aeronautics and space.” (Text; NASA Autli.

April 3: AEC’s 970-lb. snapshot spacecraft carrying Snap-lOA nuclear reactor was successfully launched from Vandenberg AFB by an Atlas-Agena booster into nearly circular polar orbit; 820-mi. (1,320 km. I apogee; 788-mi. (1,269 km.) perigee; 112 min. period; 90.17° inclination. Four hours after injection into orbit, radio command from earth activated the 250-lb, nuclear reactor by moving internal shielding that had kept the emission of electrons from the uranium-235 fuel element from reaching the chain reaction stage. The reactor would provide electric power for a 2,2-lb. ion engine. This was the first attempt to test a reactor-ion system in orbit.
Twelve hours after launch, radio signals from the Agena vehicle carrying the reactor indicated it was producing 620-668 watts of electricity—some 20% over its designed power. Electricity generated by the reactor would be stored in a 480-lb. bank of batteries and released as the ion engine was put through start-stop tests during a three-month period. The engine would manufacture its own power by electrically vaporizing the 3Vi oz. of the metal cesium in its fuel tank into atomic particles and expelling them at high speed through a nozzle to provide thrust of two-thousandths of a pound.
aec said the satellite would stay aloft more than 3,000 yrs.—far beyond the 100 yrs. it would take for the reactor’s radioactive elements to decay to a safe level. The reactor would be shut down after a year, the ion engine after about three months. If successful, the test would signal the first operation in space of a light, compact, propulsion system that would produce power over long periods on small amounts of fuel for (1) surveillance and patrol satellites functioning in orbit for years, and (2) manned spaceships capable of speeds of 100,000 mph on trips to distant planets now beyond the reach of conventionally-fuelled rockets.

Congress by the President provides for activities that are essential to continuing the progress that we have made towards our goal of preeminence in space sciences, application satellites, manned space flight, and advanced research and technological development necessary for aircraft improvements and for future space activities. It does not provide for everything that we could do or would like to do. In fact, it has been necessary within the strict budget requirements imposed by the President that certain desirable project activities started in previous years be omitted from the 1966 budget. . . .
“Within the confines of this limited budget, the President has provided the funds necessary to preserve the opportunity that we still
believe we have to accomplish a manned lunar landing and exploration within this decade. The margin for insurance that had been built into our original program plan has largely disappeared. However, we now estimate this may be possible if we can maintain our current successful development efforts and make the all-up systems testing procedure work on the very large Saturn V-Apollo combination to launch men toward the Moon on earlier flights than we had originally planned. There is, therefore, still an opportunity to accomplish this national space objective within the time specified. Our work to date gives us somewhat more confidence than we had a year ago that we can still achieve the objectives that were planned in 1961 in spite of a limit on resources that will not fund all the flights planned at that time. It is important, however, to keep in mind that in Gemini we are just now in a position to find out by flight experiments how men can live, work, remain efficient, and make important contributions in space for extended periods. . . .” (Testimony; Incl.

•	Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, afsc Commander, spoke in a luncheon address
on military technology at the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles: “. . . we can expect substantial improvements in materials with re' spect to their strength, stiffness, and ability to operate at high temperatures.
“One such material, a composite formed from boron fibers in a plastic binder, has been demonstrated in the laboratory to have approximately five times the specific strength of today’s aircraft alloys. . . . This . . . will give increased strength at greatly reduced weight. Another material is oxide dispersed nickel, which can make possible
an increase of several hundred degrees in turbine operating temperatures, enough to double the thrust of today’s jet engines, with no increase in weight. . . .
“In propulsion, these advances in materials and component technology can make available engines for vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with more than double our present thrust-to-weight ratios and transport engines with half of today’s fuel consumption. The use of hydrogen would make feasible engines for long range hypersonic craft flying at 7,000 miles per hour—almost four times as fast as the most sophisticated supersonic transport now proposed. And the aircraft will be of smaller size to do the same job.
“New technologies in flight dynamics, such as laminar flow control, can materially increase the ranges of transport aircraft. If laboratory boron composite structures pan out, we could build aircraft that could carry twice the payload at the same weight and range of present models. With further understanding of variable geometry wings we can alleviate the difficulties of operating at a variety of combinations of speed and altitude.” (Text)

travehicular activity, as accomplished by the Soviets, and orbital changes, as accomplished by Gus Grissom and John Young . . . are essential to future progress in space exploration. Both are objectives of our Gemini Program and both are techniques that we must learn in order to carry out the Apollo Program. We have long assumed that both were objectives of the Soviet Program.
“Given these assumptions, the difference between the scheduling of these experiments in the Soviet program and ours is a detail of relatively minor importance. It has been our judgment that maneuver-
ing and changing orbits are more important than extravehicular activity for the progress of our program. For this reason, we scheduled the conduct of such maneuvers for the first manned flight in the Gemini Program. We must assume that the Soviets had their good reason for scheduling extravehicular activity on an earlier flight in their program.” (Text)
E. Z. Gray, also of nasa’s Office of Manned Space Flight, discussed future programs. He stressed that one of the cardinal rules guiding the planning was that maximum use must be made of hardware either already developed or currently in development. (M&R, 4/12/65, 16)

April 7: Dr. Franklin P. Dixon, nasa Director of Manned Lunar and Planetary Mission Studies, told Twin Cities aiaa Chapter in Minneapolis that NASA was “investigating and planning manned missions and experiments beyond the presently approved Gemini and Apollo programs. . . .
“A logical sequence for future NASA manned space flight programs . . . begins with the Gemini and Apollo program base. The next logical development is the Apollo F.xtension System ( aes ) which is a stepping stone to advanced Earth-orbital operations, to lunar-orbital surveys, and to lunar surface exploration. The AES Earth-orbital activities are a development phase for an orbital research laboratory or early space station as well as a lunar exploration station. Based on the Apollo Command and Service module technology, we can also develop advanced logistic systems for larger orbiting space stations of indefinite life or for greater expansion of lunar exploration if desired. The advanced orbiting space station can likewise lead to an orbiting launch complex for planetary missions such as Martian flyby and exploration shelters or a lunar base for potential exploitation of the lunar environment. ... In Earth orbit, the AES can provide for experimental operations in the three major fundamental areas . . . : (1) flights to conduct scientific research in space requiring man’s presence; (2) Earth-oriented applications to increase the nation’s strength, and (3) development of advanced technology for support of both manned and unmanned space operations. ... In the field of Earth-oriented applications of manned space operations, nasa has been conducting studies and investigations jointly with the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Interior and Defense to determine how we might apply Apollo’s unique capabilities to improve our ability to forecast weather, to communicate globally at high data rates, to make an up-to-date inventory of the world’s resources, to monitor air and sea traffic on a global scale, to support a world-wide air-sea rescue service, to make better forecasts of food production and to provide a data-gathering system on a global scale. Experiments are also being evaluated to enhance over-all development of space operations. Biomedical, behavioral and other medical studies would be conducted as well as the development of advanced subsystems and technology for spacecraft. . . .” (Text)

“. . . we are on the verge of another major breakthrough—the capability to forecast weather at least five days in advance with better accuracy than we can now predict 24 to 36 hours ahead. Atmospheric systems such as weather balloons and ground and seabased instruments which are already developed, together with satellite systems and high speed computers, should make it practicable in the next few years to establish a global observation system. As distinguished from the satellites whose main mission is cloud cover photographs, the more advanced future system will be able to map the structure of the earth’s atmosphere in terms of wind, temperature, and pressure at various altitudes.”
He continued: “We foresee the possibility of carrying sensors in satellites that will give us the thermal patterns of the ocean’s surface which, when compared with the atmospheric conditions in any area, may give us the ability to predict the formation of fog. Similarly, ocean currents can be mapped and studied to advance the science of oceanography. We can even measure sea state—roughness of the sea —from a satellite.” (Text)

With just one shot, they’d end up with pictures of a space no bigger than the size of an urban lot, or of the peak of the Alps, or of the sand dunes in Arabia. Could they tell anything about the earth from pictures of just one of these?” The Ranger program, just concluded with the success of ranger ix, gave U.S. scientists good pictures of three different areas of the moon, Shoemaker said. “A Ranger picture is worth a million computer words.” (Perez.

Report was a comprehensive summary of views by the Committee and Panel members and the more than 150 scientists and engineers attending as representatives of Government, industry, and the scientific and academic communities. In its general conclusion, report stated three objectives for future improvement of U.S. civil aeronautics: “Insure that our economy continued to have the best air transportation system to give it a continuing advantage in world competi-
tion”; “Insure that U.S. aeronautical development is immediately responsive to the demand, and sufficiently great to continue leadership in the domestic and world markets”; and “Maintain recognized world leadership in technical matters to insure a favorable image and stature of the U.S. technological competence in aeronautical development.” Some of its general observations on the future of aeronautics:
“There is a need for more centralized direction, control, and procedure . . . [of the] widely dispersed . . . technical competence and expertise behind aeronautical development in the United States. . . .
“The aircraft industry in general is willing to contribute to any program designed to further aviation advancement, but the degree of their contribution will depend upon the extent of Government support, and the availability of a market. The extent is also dictated by the extent of their earnings on marketable products for which the Government is usually the principal customer.

Dr. Newell presented the case for manned space flight: “The manned space flight effort serves to round out the total program. Its primary aim is to develop a broad space capability that will secure to this nation strength, security, flexibility, and freedom of choice in space. Landing men on the moon and returning them to earth has been chosen as the means to this broader, more substantive end, and it is not to be considered as the only justification for our manned space effort.”
Dr. Abelson, speaking for the critics, said: “The unmanned program has been a substantial contributor to our international prestige. Moreover, prestige based on science and technology tends to be enduring. ...
“Our Apollo program was launched for reasons of international prestige. The yield has not been very good or very lasting.

in Orlando, Fla., ksc’s Richard E. Dutton, said: “. . . NASA’s major launch facility for space vehicles and unmanned and manned spacecraft [is] the John E. Kennedy Space Center and its new Merritt Island Spaceport. I hope you noticed that I used the term Spaceport, instead of Moonport, as it is often referred to in the news media. We call it a Spaceport because its basic concept is not to exist as a research and development facility for any one mission only; it is being created to function as an actual port, with a space vehicle launch rate that may be some day as high as one manned launch per month.
“However, just as important to consider is the spaceport’s capacity for growth. It can accommodate launch vehicles with up to 40 million pounds of thrust, 32.5 million pounds more than the Saturn V here can deliver. Because of this, the United States has not invested three quarters of a billion dollars in a facility which will serve only to launch a manned lunar mission. It has acquired a permanent installa-
tion which will serve the requirements of the National Space Program for years to come.
“But these facilities, like the lunar landing mission, are themselves only a manifestation of a greater entity—people. At present, 2,500 NASA and 6,300 contractor employees work at the Center. By 1967, when the spaceport becomes operational, 3,000 government employees and 10,000 contractor employees will be employed.” (Text)

•	In a Missiles and Rockets editorial, William J. Coughlin questioned
NASA’s wisdom in drawing up mission requirements for lunar exploration. The article said:	“Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA associate
administrator, told Congress last year:	‘Ranger will play an important
role in the support of Project Apollo.’ . . .
“Not a single change has been made in any part of the Apollo system or in the program’s operational plan as a result of the Ranger findings. None is contemplated. The reason for this is simple. The Block m Rangers were incapable of producing any such data. . . .
“The case for Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter as supports for the Apollo program ... is not a very strong one. . . .
“Dr. Newell sees them as part of what he calls the ‘total program for exploring the Moon.’ . . . [He said] in the following statement to Congress:	‘You will have a lunar landing. That lunar landing will
involve a few hours of stay on the Moon, a look that the astronauts can make, a few collections of samples, maybe some simple tests, and maybe the implacement by the astronauts of monitors to be left on the lunar surface.’
“After their departure, Dr. Newell sees the instruments carrying on. Lunar Orbiter wheels overhead. Surveyor explores areas on the moon which Man would have difficulty in reaching. . . .
“We suggest that if anyone proposed exploring the Antarctic in such a manner, he would he clapped in the pokey as a nut. Man is going to the Moon and he is going to explore it. Expenditure of billions of dollars on instruments remotely controlled from Earth to do the same job is folly.” {M&R, 4/12/65, 46)
April 12: Chickens exposed to one half to three times the earth’s gravity had contracted chronic acceleration sickness in tests conducted at the Univ. of California. Dr. Russell R. Burton, a veterinarian at the University conducting the experiments as part of a program supported by NASA and the Office of Naval Research, said there was great variation among the chickens in susceptibility to the sickness:	“Some chickens
will show symptoms after a few days at i.5g, but others not until many months at 3g, and, of course, some never exhibit any of the symptoms. However, once the sickness develops, symptoms are the same.” Sick fowl developed enlarged adrenal glands and their digestive functions became abnormal. Some chickens’ legs were paralyzed as a result of increased gravity forces.
Objective of the tests was to determine effects of artificially altering body weight. Interest in increased gravity fields stemmed from greater fields present on other planets such as Jupiter, which has gravity 2]/> times that on earth. (Av. Wk., 4/12/65, 79)
• Robert Hotz, editorializing in Aviation Week and Space Technology, said that it could be a “dangerous mistake” to defer development of earth-orbital operational capabilities until financial and technical peak loads of Apollo had been passed:	“The Soviets ob-
viously have chosen the earth-orbital approach to their lunar landing mission. Therefore, they necessarily must develop rather fully their hardware and operational techniques in this area as a vital prelude to their lunar landing attempts and not as a postlude, in the manner of current U.S. planning. They also have made little attempt to conceal their primary military interest in the development of manned spacecraft operations in the earth-orbital area.
“Thus, it is entirely possible that unless U.S. policy is drastically changed soon, the Soviets may have an opportunity to achieve the
technical surprise in space that they so narrowly missed in the race to an intercontinental ballistic missile.” (Av. Wk., 4/12/65, 21)

•	At a news conference, astronomers at Moscow’s Sternberg Institute of
Astronomy repudiated the Tass report that radio signals had been received from a “super civilization” in outer space. The astronomers explained that their studies had been based on a radio signal from a point in space called cta-102—a designation of the California Institute of Technology for a quasi-stellar radio source. Signals had been picked up from cta-102 systematically in fluctuating strength that followed a regular 100-day pattern. They said that although no other radio emission from outer space had the same periodicity, it was too early to tell whether the radio signals were artificially made by intelligent beings or whether they came from a natural source.

They had asserted that the oldest of continental rocks were so very ancient that the sun’s and the earth’s ages allowed too little time for continent formation by earthly processes and from earthly materials. Two alternative explanations were proposed:	(1) either the sun and the earth must be much older, perhaps
by a half-billion years or more; or, (2) the original continents were
thrown down upon the planet’s surface when objects from space— hundreds of miles across in size—crashed into the earth. Research results had been published in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. (Abraham, Phil. Eve. Bull., 4/13/65)

April 15—16: World scientists met in a special conference on the lunar surface sponsored by the International Astronomical Union and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Md.
Noting areas of disagreement among scientists, theoretical astrophysicist Thomas Gold of Cornell Univ. tried to explain why the Ranger pictures resolved so little: “The Ranger pictures are like a mirror. Everyone sees his own theories reflected in them.” Prof. Gold saw a moon covered with dust; young craters composed of solid rock while older craters had somehow gone soft; and vast sheets of ice locked under compacted sediment beneath much of the lunar surface.
Dr. Harold C. Urey, Nobel prize-winning chemist from the Univ. of California, referred to evidence of widespread collapse of the lunar surface, probably due to underground movement: “The ranger ix’s pictures scared me more than anything. There’s all sorts of evidence that some of these craters are sinking.”
Dr. Eugene Shoemaker of the U.S. Geological Survey said that chances that the moon’s surface was too soft for the 15-ton Lem were “almost vanishingly remote.” (Simons, Wash. Post, 4/16/65; Clark,

Dr. Ewan A. Whitaker agreed with findings in the paper he presented for his colleague, Dr. Gerald P. Kuiper of the Univ. of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. Dr. Kuiper concluded that the lunar surface had a bearing strength of between one and two tons per square foot. His calculations, made from data extracted from RANGER IX photographs, was based on the size of rocks ejected from a given impact crater and the distance they traveled. Other tentative findings were that the dark portions of the maria were due to some unknown fluid flows and not lava or ash flows; that the maria were not completely covered with lunar dust; and that the moon’s surface exhibited a remarkable series of fracture patterns which could be due to polar contraction, tidal effects, or some other force.

as meteorites, it is necessary to assume that the interior at one time was partly molten.” Prof. Levin said the moon was formed simultaneously with the earth and was not originally part of it. It was about 10 earth-radii distant and later shifted to the present position. He added: “We believe that there is a lava flow not covered by dust.” (Wash.

April 19: A detailed report on the progress of the Mars-bound mariner iv spacecraft was presented at annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington, D.C.:
mariner iv, launched Nov. 28, 1964, was on course to fly by Mars shortly after 9 p.m. edt on July 14. Four of mariner iv’s six experiments were still working well. The ionization experiment had ceased to function and data from the solar plasma probe were only partially interpretable. At 3 p.m., mariner iv was 58,176,037 mi. from the earth. It had traveled 221,330,000 mi. on its journey of 325 million miles.
mariner iv had returned a considerable amount of scientific data. A cosmic ray telescope aboard the 575-lb. spacecraft had, for example, “observed” more solar protons than alpha particles from the sun. John A. Simpson of Univ. of Chicago said this indicated there was a “different kind of mechanism operating on the sun for accelerating these particles in space.”
A report from a team of scientists from NASA GSFC and Temple Univ. indicated that mariner iv was encountering increasing amounts of cosmic dust as it moved further away from the sun. mariner iv’s cosmic dust detector had been hit 95 times.

It is this apparently excessive freedom of action on the part of employees which makes for the concern of students of administration about the management of research, or the lack thereof. My conclusion is that most of this problem evaporates once it is realized that a director of research directs the research program—but certainly not the individual researchers.
“The partnership of science, engineering and industry is really a rather new concept developed since the turn of the century and only now reaching maturity. An even newer concept is the partnership of science, engineering, and government. A problem we must face up to —whether we represent industry, government or science—is the effective use of research in creating a better future for everyone.

April 19: Two teams of scientists collecting dust from Greenland and Antarctic icecaps presented their findings to the American Geophysical Union, meeting in Washington. The scientists were collecting particles by “core sampling”—boring through the ice with a thermal drill and analyzing particles to determine their origin. Team studying Greenland samples—E. L. Fireman, J. Defelice, and C. C. Langway, Jr., of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the U.S. Army—believed their dust samples to be nonterrestrial in origin. Team studying Antarctic samples—M. B. Giovinetto of the Univ. of Wisconsin and R. A. Schmidt of NASA—was not certain of the origin of these particles. They reported a high concentration of spherucles in the core samplings; the amount of these particles, which closely matched those found in volcanic eruptions, made identification of dust origin more difficult. They had collected dust from 165-ft. core of ice, representing 400 yrs. accumulation. Greenland team had drilled to depth of 1,800 ft. and expected to continue to 5,000 ft. National Science Foundation would use the same thermal drill—beginning in summer of 1967 or 1968—to drill to 8,000-ft. depth through the south polar ice. (Simons, Wash. Post, 4/20/65, 1)

maintenance and operation charges have by now pushed the bill close to a third of a billion.
“By any rational standard, the x-15 has been worth every penny. It has given the United States far more than mere supremacy in the flight record books; it has provided a foundation for advanced aeronautical technology that could have been obtained in no other way.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 4/20/65)

• Donald E. Crabhill of the Bureau of the Budget discussed “Space Programs and the Federal Budget” before the National Space Club: “What are some of the significant factors to be pointed out in the relationship between the space program and the budget?
“The first is, of course, the matter of growth in the funding for space and the current absolute amount of funds allocated to space programs, including not only NASA, but also dod, aec, and activities in this area by other agencies. In FY 1957, approximately $150 million was expended by the Federal Government on space programs. In fy 1960, the total was still below $900 million. In fy 1966, the tenth year of the space age, the President’s budget provides for space expenditures of $6.9 billion.
“Where does this amount stand in relation to amounts in the administrative budget for other programs? It is less than the total amounts to be spent in 1966 on national defense; on health, labor, and welfare programs; and on interest on the national debt. But it is greater than that to be spent for any other function of Government. Space expenditures of all agencies will be greater in 1966 than those for international affairs and finance, for agriculture, for natural resources, for commerce and transportation, for housing and community development, for veterans benefits and services, or for other general Government.
“The space program has not been, since it was initiated, and is not today, a budgetary underdog.
“The second specific point to be made is that the budget process by its very nature is an exercise in priorities. ... A great many merely desirable projects get deferred throughout the Government every year under the press of the budgetary process.
“In the past, this pressure has not been felt as severely in the space area as it has in most others because of the emphasis that has been given to creating in a hurry a vast capability to operate in space. The space program has been very successful in meeting this aim. In fact, it has been so successful that space is now coming of age with other Government programs. We will soon have a technical capability to do
a great many more space missions than we as a nation will probably want to pay for. . . .
“There is one other point that, as a budget examiner, I feel I must mention. Funding and schedule estimates for space programs have been historically quite unreliable. Cost estimates have tended not so much merely to grow, but to multiply! At the same time, schedules have tended to slip, slip, slip.
“This was an understandable situation while the space program was new, but we have had enough experience that there will be considerable resistance from now on to escalation in price and radical slips in schedule of the next generation of space projects. The more detailed planning we are doing now, the phased project procurement processes, and the experience we have gained in the technology and the techniques of Space operations must be expected to show returns in better ability to make good cost and schedule estimates in the first place, and then to meet the cost and schedule targets that are approved.” (Text)

•	Thomas W. Thompson of Cornell Univ. said in a paper presented at the
meeting of the American Geophysical Union that half the moon’s surface had been mapped in a lunar mapping program using the radio-
radar telescope at Cornell’s Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico. From the radar signal returns, the hardest areas of the moon were the rim and floor of the relatively new craters. The floors of the older craters and the surface of the maria were covered by a three-to-four-meter-thick layer of highly porous material often referred to as “lunar dust.” (Simons, Wash.

April 21: Dr. Gordon H. Pettingill, Dr. Rolf H. Dyce, and Dr. Thomas Gold of Cornell Univ., reported to the meeting of the American Geophysical Union that through radar studies with Cornell’s l,000-ft.-diameter radiotelescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, they had found an apparent “flat spot” on the planet Mars that seemed to correspond to markings seen there through telescopes. They also reported that radar observations indicated the planet Mercury rotated on its own axis once each 54 to 64 days, exposing all sides to the sun in a year. Its full day, corresponding to a 24-hr. earth cycle, would be about 180 earth days long. It was inconclusive whether Mercury rotated in the opposite direction from its orbit—a retrograde rotation—or in the same direction as its orbit—a direct rotation.
Dr. Gold also speculated that Mercury could not have been in its present orbit for much longer than 400 million years. Otherwise, he postulated, the sun would have held the planet over a long enough period of time to force it into a synchronous or 88-day rotation. This suggested to Gold that Mercury might once have been a moon of Venus but broke away or was tugged away to establish its own orbit around the sun. (Hines, Wash. Eve.

•	At aiaa/aflc/asd Support for Manned Flight Conference in Dayton,
Ohio, Temple W. Neumann of Philco Corp. reviewed studies of manned Mars missions and discussed the importance of “early biological precursor missions” to Mars. He concluded:
“It has been shown that the lack of biological, as well as critical environmental, data about Mars can have important ramifications in
not only the cost, but possibly even in the feasibility of performing early manned missions to Mars. The importance of preliminary knowledge about the interaction of possible Martian organisms with man and his equipment has been shown to significantly affect surface operations, decontamination requirements, and equipment reliability. Further, the need for some preliminary data about the nature of Martian organisms is necessary in order to intelligently design an experimental program for use by the first manned landing expedition. The conclusion can therefore be supported that a precursor biological mission, such as that represented by the current ABL studies, is mandatory in the early 1970 time period if manned missions are to make effective use of the mid-1980 launch opportunities.” (Text, aiaa Paper 65-249)
April 22: With arrival of the sea-going launch platform USNS Croatan at Valparaiso, Chile, NASA completed a successful expedition of launching scientific experiments off the west coast of South America.

•	At Purdue Univ., Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator
for Manned Space Flight, discussed in a speech nasa’s emphasis on man’s part in future planned space experiments:	“The role of man in
space is basic to any discussion of our planned space experiments. . . . We have always recognized his inherent characteristics as a sensor, manipulator, evaluator and investigator.
“As a sensor, man adds little to automatic equipment in space— sometimes nothing at all. . . . instruments can measure . . . phenomena that man cannot perceive at all.
“But instruments are limited by the knowledge we now have on earth; they cannot cope with the unexpected or the unknown. Man, on the other hand, can operate in any unprogrammed situation and reap full benefits of the true objective of manned operations. He can explore the unknown.
“The second function of man in space is manipulation. Gus Grissom demonstrated superbly last month that a man can operate the spacecraft controls for delicate maneuvering. . . .
“In the conduct of space research also, man as a manipulator can probe into his environment. He can make use of motor responses and verbal skills to carry out procedures and to assemble, operate and repair equipment. . . .
“With the capacity to evaluate, man achieves a substantial degree of self-reliance in controlling what he perceives and how he reacts. When a man remembers, analyzes, compares, and induces—using a solid foundation of knowledge—he has improved the degree to which meaningful data can be translated into useful knowledge. . . .
“The most advanced role of man in space is that of an investigator who responds creatively to unexpected situations. He is able to postulate theories and hypotheses, and to devise and use systematic measurements. In this role, the astronaut is a full-fledged scientist.” (Text)

•	New sunspots heralding the start of a new 11-yr. cycle were discussed at
sessions on the International Years of the Quiet Sun held in Washington, D.C., under auspices of the American Geophysical Union and the International Scientific Radio Union. Scientists said the asymmetrical birth of the new cycle suggested it might not reach as intense a maximum as usual.
The cycle was of vital interest to planners of a manned moon landing since it had been discovered that some solar eruptions shoot out protons at so close to the speed of light they could kill an astronaut. While astronauts were on the moon, or inside the Lem, they would be poorly protected against such a proton shower. Dr. Herbert Friedman, of the Naval Research Laboratory, said during the symposium they would be comparatively safe if they could return to their orbiting command capsule. The goal, therefore, he said, was to learn enough about these events so that astronauts could have sufficient warning to take refuge in their spacecraft. (Sullivan, NYT, 4/23/65)

The faa report, which included preliminary results from boom tests at the White Sands Missile Range, concluded that only abnormally massive booms would create serious problems. A principal finding in the “community reactions” study stated: “Substantial numbers of residents reported interference with ordinary living activities and annoyance with such interruptions, but the overwhelming majority felt they could learn to live with the numbers and kinds of booms experienced during the six-month study.”
The three volumes just released were “Structural Response to Sonic Booms,” “Community Reactions to Sonic Booms in the Oklahoma City Area, February-July 1964,” and “Final Program Summary, Oklahoma City Sonic Boom Study, February 3-July 30, 1964.”
Publication of these three documents completed the five-part Oklahoma City report. Two volumes had been made public in February 1965. (faa Release 65-34)
•	Expansion of the role of the National Science Foundation and expenditure
by Federal mission-oriented research agencies of more money on basic research were two major recommendations of a special panel of the National Academy of Sciences to Congress. Recommendations were in a report, Basic Research and National Goals, submitted to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics.
The panel, headed by Dr. George B. Kistiakowsky of Harvard Univ., former science adviser to the President, was comprised of 15 scientists, engineers, and economists. The panel held that the National Science Foundation, as the sole agency of Government whose purpose was support of science across the board without regard for immediate practical gains, should be expanded to serve as a “balance wheel” to soften the impact of variable research policies of mission-oriented agencies on “little science.” The recommendation that agencies should devote greater portions of their budgets to basic research was based on the view that in many cases these budgets were becoming stationary while the capacity for scientific growth was expanding. The panel also recommended that in some cases the Congress should extend the mission of the agency to include the pursuit of certain branches of basic research.
Three general opinions were widely held by the panel regarding the balance of science support today: first, Federal funds should be allocated with some consideration to the geographical-social effects of their expenditure; second, biological sciences had been under-supported and should receive support to expand them faster than the physical sciences; third, there was an impending crisis in the physical sciences because mission-oriented agencies, faced with stationary budgets, would probably not expand their support of basic physical research as fast as capacity to do basic research expanded.

April 25: Dr. Hideo Itokawa, professor at Tokyo Univ. and deputy director of Japan’s Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science, was quoted on Japan’s role in space activity by Peter Temm in an article in the Washington Sunday Star: “Space research is not a competition. It should be a cooperative undertaking among all countries, to explore and study the universe.
“Both America and Russia appear to be chiefly interested in artificial satellites and manned space vehicles. I see Japan’s role as filling some of the gaps skipped over by these two nations.
“I believe it is possible that Russia may be preparing to abandon its project of putting a man on the moon in favor of assembling a satellite space station; at least, this how I interpret the recent Voskhod flight and its emphasis on carrying out tasks outside of the capsule.
“I sincerely hope if this is so, that American space scientists will not swerve from their intentions of getting to the moon. There are many sides to space research, and the ideal approach is for all nations engaged in the new science to tackle different areas.

In its final report transmitted to NASA Administrator Webb, the group said that “given all evidence presently avail-
able, we believe it entirely reasonable that Mars is inhabited with living organisms and that life independently originated there,” and thus that “the biological exploration of Mars is a scientific undertaking of the greatest validity and significance.”
The panel noted, however, that “while we are eager to press Martian exploration as expeditiously as the technology and other factors permit, we insist that our recommendation to proceed is subject to one rigorous qualification: that no viable terrestrial microorganisms reach the Martian surface until we can make a confident assessment of the consequences.”
The group made seven basic recommendations: (1) “every opportunity for remote observation of Mars by earth-bound or ballon-and satellite-borne instruments should be exploited”; (2) “. . . An adequate program for Martian exploration cannot be achieved without using scientific payloads substantially larger than those currently employed in outer unmanned space research program. . . . We see very substantial advantages in the use, from the onset, of the new generation of large boosters which are expected to become operational toward the end of the decade”; (3) since flyby missions “yield at best a fleeting glimpse of the planet” and carry a relatively small array of instruments, “we deliberately omit an explicit recommendation in favor of any flyby missions additional to those already executed or planned”;
(4)	“Every effort should be made to achieve a large orbiting mission by 1971 at the latest. This mission should precede the first lander. . . . By ‘large’ we mean a scientific payload that would include instrumentation for infrared and television mapping, microwave radiometry and bistatic radar, infrared spectrometry, and optical polarimetry”;
(5)	“The first landing mission should be scheduled no later than 1973 and by 1971 if possible” and will “ultimately demand a large lander” like Abl (Automated Biological Lab) ; (6) “The task of designing an Abl should be initiated immediately as a continuing project”; and (7) to maintain “a continuing dialogue among all potential investigators and the engineers responsible for implementing their scientific goals,” the Academy’s Space Science Board should have a standing committee, (nas Release; Abraham, Phil.

April 26: Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) discussed in the Senate S. 1483, bill which he had introduced to establish a National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities. He cited article by Frank Getlein on the recent “Eyewitness to Space” exhibition at the National Gallery of Art. Get-lein’s article showed “how cooperation between our Government and the arts can illuminate some of the most exciting moments in our important explorations in space.” The exhibition contained some 70 paintings and drawings by 15 artists under the NASA art program.

April 29: At the Spring Meeting of the American Physical Society, Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, attempted to answer the question “What can the space program do for experimental sciences like physics”:	“. . . the impact
that space techniques are having and have already had on geophysics ... is three-fold in character. First, the geophysicist finds in the space program powerful tools to use in a new approach to solving old problems. Secondly, the application of space techniques to geophysics has already turned up a number of exciting new problems, greatly broadening the scope of the discipline. Thirdly, as space probes, and eventually men. reach other bodies of the solar system such as the moon and planets, the domain of geophysics grows beyond the confines of a single body of the solar system. Let us consider each of these extensions to geophysics a little further.
“. . . space techniques have provided new tools for studying old problems of geophysics. Geodesy, meteorology, upper atmospheric physics, ionospheric research, and sun-earth relationships have all benefited from the application of space techniques. In the case of geodesy, the influence of the earth upon the orbits of various artificial satellites has been measured by careful radio, radar, and optical tracking and used to obtain quantitative measures of the various harmonics in the expansion of the earth’s gravitational potential. As a consequence of such measurements it has been found that the earth’s equatorial bulge is some 70 meters greater than one would expect. . . . Other departures of the geoid from the figure of hydrostatic equilibrium have also been determined from these satellite measurements. . . . These measurements in turn have important implications for the distribution of matter within the earth, and for the internal strength of the earth’s mantle.” (Text)

The Scientific Task Force would educate the scientific community with the manned space flight program and thereby acquire its ideas on the subject, and acquaint the NASA directors with the ideas for scientific experiments suggested by the academic community.

During April: Martin Summerfield, Princeton Univ., said in aiaa editorial that most of the critics of the U.S. space program were erecting and knocking down “straw men.” Some of the attacks on the space program were designed to divert space funds “to other, supposedly more important purposes,” and these viewpoints are “pushed too hard and can lead the nation in dangerous directions.” The more significant criticism on scientific grounds was that ground-based instruments (supplemented by unmanned probes) can gather data about space, the moon and other celestial bodies more effectively than rocket-launched exploration. This criticism, he said, “misses the mark completely because it takes for granted that the national space program—or at least the NASA part of it—was conceived simply as a scientific venture. . . .” He recalled the words of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which provided “clearly . . . the overriding intent to develop the technology of space flight as an extension of the former naca’s commitment to aeronautical flight. . . .
“The real issue is whether the nation should continue to develop the technology for flight in space, capitalizing on such useful applications as seem practical from time to time. The answer can only be ‘yes,’ and nothing less than a vigorous program will do. It makes no sense to insist that so broad a program be evaluated in competition with telescopes or unmanned scientific probes. Advances in space science will not substitute for flying capability. Each of these efforts is important in its own right. . . .”	(A&A, 4/65, 23)
•	Orville H. Daniel discussed small rockets—chiefly meteorological sound-
ing rockets—in International Science and Technology. “Forty years ago, when Dr. Goddard was performing his first experiments, all rockets were small rockets. Today, with thrusts nearing 10 million pounds and rocket vehicles approaching the size of small skyscrapers, a 500-pound-thrust rocket seems like a relic of the past. Nevertheless, such small rockets remain as important to science and as challenging to technology as Dr. Goddard’s fledglings were in his day. About 1500 of them were fired last year for various scientific purposes. . . .” (Int. Sci. & Tech., 4/65, 32-37)

May 1965
May 1: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, speaking at Rose Polytechnic Institute, Terre Haute, Ind.: “Indeed, the success of the national space program depends to a very large degree on the quality and the extent of involvement by the universities. Their most important contribution would naturally be in doing the jobs they are uniquely qualified to do, that is, in research and in educating and training at both the undergraduate and graduate levels the scientists, engineers, and other professional personnel required by the space program. . . .
“With its university program, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is approaching a goal established early in its history. That goal, when achieved, will provide a substantial increment to those trained men who are capable of guiding this country’s undertakings in science and technology confidently toward future needs that are only partially visible to us now. That goal is being pursued in institutions of higher learning where men teach and practice their specialties in the context of other highly refined fields of interest. Surely, this concept is broader than the space program itself.” (Text)

May 2: The recommendation to nasa by NAS-convened study group [see Apr. 26] that Mars receive “the highest priority among all objectives in space science,” evoked editorial comment from the New York T imes :
“The biological exploration of Mars will not be cheap, and available funds for scientific research and development are limited.
“The likely costs and returns of the search for Martian life must be compared with those from, say, programs for stepped-up research into cancer or for building giant accelerators that would permit physicists to peer more deeply into the recesses of the atomic nucleus. That broader consideration may well suggest a less concentrated program than the scientists had recommended.
“Such a decision would have the added advantage of allowing more time for an effort to make the search for Martian life a cooperative international project and not, . . . merely one more arena for the wasteful duplication that is the essence of Soviet-American space competition.” {NYT, 5/2/65)
May 3: Nike-Cajun sounding rocket was launched from Wallops Station, Va., to obtain temperature, wind, density, and pressure at a time of minimum zonal wind flow by exploding twelve grenades during the ascent of the rocket. Two grenades did not eject and a third exploded before complete ejection, causing complete failure of experiment. Coordinated firings did not occur simultaneously at Ft. Churchill or Pt.

•	A gemini in experiment in which blood cells subjected to a known
dosage of radiation were allowed to float around weightless in a container showed that weightlessness had no effect on irradiated human blood cells, according to Charles W. Mathews, Gemini program manager. He also explained why gemini ill landed about 60 mi. short of predicted spot: The pilots were instructed to fly a bank angle based on wind-tunnel data of Gemini spacecraft’s lift characteristics. But in actual reentry, the spacecraft’s “lift was only about % of what
we had expected it to be.” Onboard instrumentation showed the discrepancy, but the command pilot followed ground instructions. When he ultimately changed the angle, based on the onboard display, it was too late to achieve the spacecraft target. (Transcript)
May 3: Editorializing in Aviation Week and Space Technology, Robert Hotz said that during the Eurospace meeting in Philadelphia, European members had made significant points of interest: “Europe needs a technically strong, economically beneficial and politically imaginative space program of its own if it is to remain a powerful economic entity and maintain its present standard of general prosperity .. . Europe must organize its technical and political resources on an over-all European level to be successful in space technology. .. . European industry faces a formidable task in selling the economic and political benefits of space technology to its people and governments. . . . European industry must develop its own space technology and cannot remain technically dependent on the U.S. regardless of how much support this country is willing to provide.” Hotz concluded that “the fact that the discussions were so blunt and realistic proved the value of an organization such as Eurospace where these admittedly	knotty problems can	be
aired. . . .” (Hotz, Av. Wk., 5/3/65, 11)
• Discussions at last week’s Eurospace meeting in Philadelphia indicated that “Europeans are eagerly seeking means to acquire U.S. technical know-how and systems management capability without buying hardware,” wrote William J. Coughlin in a Missiles and Rockets editorial. He continued: “This was recognized in a blunt statement by Lockheed vice president Elmer P. Wheaton:
“ ‘As we see the situation, the real reason today for joint U.S.-European industrial cooperation is to facilitate acquisition by Europe of the technical capability the United States has been fortunate enough to develop. If we objectively appraise the existing circumstances, we all recognize that U.S. cooperation will often simply strengthen the European ability to compete more effectively with U.S. firms. With these facts in mind, it is obvious that the purchase of U.S. hardware does not best fulfill Europe’s aims’. . . .
“As Lord Caldecote, managing director of the guided weapons division of British Aircraft Corp., put it: ‘I cannot believe European taxpayers will be prepared to put forward money for programs on which American firms are prime contractors’. . . .
“The most hopeful route to European space collaboration probably lies in the proposals put forward for navigation, meteorological and television satellites.” (Coughlin, M&R, 5/3/65, 46)

“A great deal of lifting-body research is being performed by NASA and the usaf. In the not too distant future we will enter into the truly second generation manned spacecraft era by relying more on a higher l/d (lift-drag ratio) such as a hypersonic l/d of about 1.3. . . . The lifting body second generation manned spacecraft gives operational versatility for reentry from a number of orbit planes and gives a recovery capability at a number of landing sites within the United States. This versatility also increases the margin of safety for the astronauts. . . .” (Text)

May 4—6: U.S.S.R. Mars probe zond ii had stopped transmitting data to earth, Russian physicist, Gennadii Skuridin, told the AAS-iit Research Institute Symposium on Post-Apollo Space Exploration in Chicago. Cutoff apparently resulted from a failure in the probe’s solar panels caused by meteoroid impact or solar radiation, he said. Other facts about the Soviet space program made public for the first time: (1) pressure in Cosmonaut Aleksey Leonov’s spacesuit during his walk in space on March 18, was about 5.9 lbs. psi; (2) Leonov had trouble with his vision and in orienting himself while in space, but was capable of performing useful work; (3) Soviet scientists have the technological know-how to perform orbit-changing spacecraft maneuvers. A thirty-minute movie of Leonov’s walk in space gave closeup views of construction of VOSKHOD ii’s airlock, Leonov’s spacesuit, gloves, footwear, and life-support equipment back pack.
Discussing investigation of space by the U.S.S.R, Skuridin said that from 1962, the problem of going to the moon had been studied with the Cosmos series of spacecraft. He said cosmos iii and COSMOS IV had studied solor plasma, its energy and location in earth areas, and during the period April 24 to May 2, 1962, had transmitted to earth more than 50 million measurements; 20 million more had been stored in a data-storage system, cosmos xli had investigated charged particles at 40,000 mi. altitude. The Elektron series, he continued, had made important measurements of the atmosphere up to an altitude of 3,000 km. The ions of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen had also been measured.
Discussing future flights, Skuridin said the Soviet Union would like to study Saturn, Pluto, and the sun, but added that a satellite was needed that could be launched to far-off planets and the sun and return to earth, (upi, NYT, 5/6/65, 2; Kotulak. Chic. Trib., 5/7/65; M&R, 5/10/65, 12, 13)

•	usaf Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell, speaking at a meeting of
the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., said: “. . . As airmen, all of us in the Air Force look at space with real concern. Will it someday become an area of military operation? If so, what will be the U.S. posture? In military language, what is our readiness? . . .
“Space exploration is the responsibility of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. . . . The act which created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration gave NASA broad responsibilities for meeting many of the broad needs of the nation. It also stated that the Department of Defense should be responsible for and direct those space activities peculiar to or primarily associated with the
development of weapon systems, military operations or the defense of the United States.
“So we have both NASA and Air Force assigned specific responsibilities. We have the basis of a partnership. And a partnership it is in carrying out the national program as recommended by the President and authorized and funded by Congress. The intent of Congress is very clear. The members wanted the broad space capabilities of the nation to be built up as rapidly as possible without unnecessary duplication of effort or of waste. This we are attempting to do. And while I would not ordinarily try to speak for Jim Webb, the NASA Administrator, I think I can speak for him today on this subject, in saying, that it is a very well understood mutual objective between the Air Force and NASA.”
Asked his opinion about spending of $20 billion to reach the moon, McConnell said: “I think it is necessary for us to get everything we can out of space. And I think we should get it as rapidly as we can at as reasonable cost as we can. But you can’t get it rapidly and at the same time cheaply . . . going to the moon is just the end product of what we are getting out of it. If we were just going to the moon, I wouldn’t think it would be worth 20 billion dollars to go to the moon. But I don’t hesitate to say that all of the other things which we have to do, the preliminaries, and the things that we’re going to learn in the process of achieving that goal is well worth the expenditure of whatever money is required to attain the knowledge which we will attain as a result of this project.” (Text)

• U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill authorizing appropriations to NASA for FY 1966 totaling $5,183,844,850, as follows: $4,537,121,000 for research and development; $60,675,000 for construction of facilities; and $586,048,850 for administrative operations. nasa had requested $5.26 billion.
During the debate preceding passage of the bill, Rep. James G. Fulton (R-Pa.) said: “We have moved quickly. But we are not in a crash program. We are now conducting a reasonable program . . . it is a well-planned program.
“It is impossible to believe that in the fiscal year 1959 only $48,354,000 was authorized for space [nasa]. In fiscal year 1960 it went up ten times to $485,550,000. It doubled again in fiscal year 1961 to $915 million.
“In fiscal year 1962 it went to $1,361,900,000.
“In fiscal year 1963, it went to $3,742,162,000 and in fiscal year 1964 to $5,238,119,400.
“In fiscal year 1965 it went to $5,193,810,500.
“For this fiscal year, the committee has recommended $5,183,844,850, which is down from last year’s level.
“I want the House to know we have gone over these programs thoroughly. We have made cuts in the committee, and the cuts were worthwhile. They are responsible, and they are substantial. They are not small.”
Regarding funds restored to the NASA budget, Rep. Fulton said: “The M—1 engine development, the 260-inch engine development, and the snap-8 development, were ongoing programs of research that were approved by the committee and authorized by the House over the past several years. However, for reasons of economy, the Administrator cut these three programs entirely from the NASA budget. The committee on the other hand, believed that such actions in the long run would be extremely wasteful and later result in very high costs when it would become necessary to reactivate these programs.
“Consequently, the committee restored $15 million to the M-l program to continue it on a technological development level, $6.2 million to the 260-inch solid rocket program to carry it through the test firing of two full length rockets, and $6 million to the SNAP-8 to continue it at the scheduled level of effort.”
Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.) discussed changes made by the Manned Space Flight Subcommittee: “The total request by NASA for manned space flight for fiscal year 1966 is $3,567,052,000. . . . The subcommittee is recommending a total reduction of $42,825,000.
“nasa requested $3,249,485,000 for research and development in manned space flights. Total reduction in research and development amounts to $30 million. All of this reduction comes from the Apollo program. It is the view of the subcommittee that in the areas of Apollo mission support and engine development that program improvements could be made. However, the reduction was made in the total request to allow nasa to make program alterations with a broad management latitude of choice without adversely affecting the total program. It was recognized by the subcommittee that NASA, prior to coming before the committee, had made substantial reductions in their total research and development program. A further reduction was also made by the Bureau of the Budget. Based on this, the $30 million reduction is considered a maximum amount that could be taken without jeopardizing the pace and progress of the Apollo program.” (CR, 5/6/65, 9291, 9296, 9301)

Primary goal of the mission was four separate ignitions of the transtage’s engines—a feat never before attempted.
First firing, after burnout of the first two stages, lasted 296 sec. and injected the 7,000-lb. rocket-payload assembly into near-earth orbit of 125-mi. (201.3 km.) apogee, 108-mi. (173.9-km.) perigee, and 88.1min. period. After one earth orbit, about 90 min. after launch, the
third stage ignited a second time, for 37 sec., driving the stage upward into an elliptical orbit of apogee, 1,757 mi. (2,828.8 km.) and perigee, 115 mi. (185.2 km.). Two and one-half hours later, transtage’s two
8,000-lb.-thrust engines burned a third time, for 27 sec., to circularize the orbit at 1,743-mi. (2,806.2-km.) apogee and 1,729-mi. (2,783.7km.) perigee. Thirty seconds after shutdown of the transtage, an 82-lb. Lincoln Laboratory experimental communications satellite (les ii), equipped with its own rocket motor to shoot itself into a higher elliptical orbit, was spring-ejected from the stage. LES II attained orbit of 9,364-mi. (15,076-km.) apogee; 1,753-mi. (2,822-km.) perigee; 315-min. period; and 31.35° inclination. Then, 42 sec. after les II was released, a 44.5-in.-dia., 75-lb. hollow aluminum radar calibration sphere (lcs i) was ejected from the transtage. lcs I was to remain in near-circular orbit with 1,743-mi.

•	Recently released photograph of the recoverable capsule of the U.S.S.R.
Vostok spacecraft revealed that the craft was spherical and that one third of it was covered with an unidentified material marked by concentric rings. In a New York Times article, Frederic Appel said that the U.S. had rejected a spherical design for U.S. spacecraft because of its lack of dynamic stability and because, during reentry, too much surface was exposed to hot gases deflected by the heat shield raising the internal temperature above allowable limits. Appel speculated that the Soviets might have solved the problem with greater heat insulation or a more powerful cooling system and that the material marked by concentric rings could be the remains of a heat shield that had burned away.

The evidence was in the form of two chemicals, phytane and pristane, extracted from the Soudan Formation, a carbon-rich and precisely-dated geological stratum in Minnesota. Both are carbon-hydrogen compounds; both are manufactured only by living systems; both are stable enough to have survived unaltered. As Calvin reconstructed it, both chemicals were synthesized by chlorophyll-containing plants—fairly high forms of life requiring long ancestry. First signs of earthly life must therefore have existed 800 million yrs. prior to the date currently accepted. (Newsweek, 5/10/65)

•	Decision to narrow the choice of type of broadcast satellite it
would consider from three to two was announced by ComSatCorp president Joseph* V. Charyk at a stockholder’s meeting in Washington,
D.C. Two of the approaches under consideration involved satellites that would operate about 6,000 mi. above the earth: one would have 18 satellites, orbiting in random positions; the other would have 12 satellites, orbiting at “phased” or controlled positions. The third approach, being tested in early bird I, had satellites placed at an altitude of 22,000 mi. in synchronous orbit. In his speech, Charyk revealed that the corporation had decided to drop from consideration the
6.000-	mi. random version. It had been discovered, he reported, that a
6.000-	mi.-high satellite could be controlled more easily than ComSatCorp had believed when it first started studying random satellites as one alternative approach. Moreover, Charyk said, it now appeared that a satellite could be designed that would operate either at 6,000 mi. in controlled positions or at the 22,000-mi.-high, synchronous position.

A new working group was formed, with Morris Tepper (Chief of Meteorological Programs, nasa) as chairman. Called Working Group VI, for Scientific Space Experiments Concerned with Properties and Dynamics of the Troposphere and Stratosphere, it was formed to “further international understanding of, and cooperation in, the use of rocket and satellite systems and techniques for meteorological research, and to promote international discussions involving meteorologists with scientists of other disciplines in order to provide a good climate for the development of imaginative new approaches to the use of rockets and satellites for meteorological research.” (nas-nrc News Report, Vol. xv, 5/6/65, 6)
Dr. 0. Z. Gazenko, physiologist and member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that cosmonauts had no difficulty knowing the orientation of their bodies and experienced no nervous disorders if they were given visual cues. He based his remarks on experiences of Soviet cosmonauts, especially those of Lt. Col. Aleksei Leonov in voskhod ii: “When he saw the spacecraft, he had no problem know-
ing his orientation, but it was different when he didn’t see the spacecraft.”
During the launch phase, the cosmonauts’ pulse and breathing rates were greater than noted during centrifugal tests in ground laboratories. In voskhod II, it took a comparatively long time for the normal levels to be reached, according to Gazenko. Comparison of the data of the Voskhod flights with other space flights showed fewer cardiovascular variations and better responses to stress. He recommended crews of several people since “the feeling of togetherness of cosmonauts is very important.” (Text)
Success of the fully stabilized British Skylark rocket in obtaining new astrophysical data was described. Skylark was a single-stage, solid-fuel vehicle designed to carry 150-200-lb. payload to 200 km. (124 mi.) altitude. Using the sun as a reference, Skylark could achieve pointing accuracy of between two and three minutes of arc in pitch and yaw, reported Kenneth Pounds, lecturer at Leicester College, England, and one of its users: “The new Skylark has revolutionized the whole field of rocket research as far as we’re concerned.” He pointed out that many scientific experiments, such as taking x-ray photographs of the sun, could not be done by an unstabilized rocket: “You need 100 sec. or more exposure time, plus roll stabilization, or the photographs will be blurred.” (cospar Rpt.)

It shows what very important work less advanced countries can do.” {M&R, 5/24/65, 17)
Activities in the 1964 U.S. space program were summarized by Dr. Richard W. Porter, National Academy of Sciences delegate to COSPAR:	“. . . Satellite storm warnings, intercontinental television,
voice and data transmissions via satellite, all-weather navigational ‘fixes’ for ships at sea, and precise map making by means of satellite observations have become almost commonplace events. Space launchings at frequent intervals are providing a continuous stream of new information of value to science and mankind. ... In total, the various agencies of the United States carried out sixty-one successful satellite and space probe launchings; however, because of the occasional practice of launching several satellites at a time . . . the total number of useful discrete payloads in Earth orbit or escape trajectory was seventy-seven. . . .
“In addition, the United States launched seven large high-altitude rocket probes, in the range from 700 to 1100 km., and well over one hundred other scientific sounding rockets, most of which reached alti-
tudes between 110 and 250 km. Twelve hundred twenty-three small meteorological rockets, having a payload of about 5 kg. and a maximum altitude of about 60 km. were fired on regular schedules by the meteorological rocket network and more than one hundred scientifically instrumented large balloon flights were made during the period.
“Technological advances made during this period which will contribute significantly to the space-research capability of the United States include the launching of three SATURN I booster rockets, capable of putting about 7500 kg. of useful weight into Earth orbit, one titan IIIA booster, and successful tests of the CENTAUR liquid hydrogen rocket. Electrostatic ion accelerator rocket propulsion devices were tested in space during 1964, and more recently a nuclear reactor with thermoelectric energy conversion devices successfully began an endurance run in space which is still continuing. Passive gravity-gradient stabilization techniques have been perfected by means of additional satellite tests to the point where this technique is ready for useful employment in a variety of space applications. The highly directional properties of a lasar beam were successfully used in tracking a satellite. Significant improvements were also made in sounding rocket, high altitude balloon design and in data conversion facilities.” (Text)
K.	Maeda, chief Japanese delegate to the sixth international space symposium of cospar, told Missiles and Rockets Japan would launch its own satellite with its own launch vehicle within the next three years. A four-stage, solid-fueled rocket would be used, with the Mu rocket as first stage. The satellite, to be used solely for scientific research, would weigh between 50-100 kgs. and be sent into a 500-1,000-km. (311-621-mi.) orbit. (M&R, 5/17/65, 9)
At a news conference during the cospaf. meeting, A. A. Blagonravov, chief Soviet delegate, said that in view of the difficulties of soft landing on the moon, the Soviet Union would probably try to soft land another Lunik before attempting to land cosmonauts.

•	A descriptive report on the three generations of Soviet manned space-
craft—vostok i through vostok vi, first generation; voskhod i, second generation; and voskhod II, third generation—was prepared by Space Daily, in collaboration with Soviet space officials and the Novos-ti Press Agency: “The Soviet’s first three generations of manned spacecraft are injected into orbit within a standard cone-cylinder configuration with a maximum length of 30.3 feet and a maximum diameter of 8.7 feet . . .
“The launch-to-orbit vehicle is comprised of four major components: the last stage of the rocket; the instrument and service module; the cosmonaut cabin and re-entry capsule; and the nose cone and fairing. . . .
“The cabin for the first two generation spacecraft remained in external configuration essentially the same. The major modification . . . was the internal arrangement providing a capability for two astronauts instead of one which included the requirement for an additional hatch. The third generation spacecraft has required not only a major modification for the internal arrangement, for the third cosmonaut, but has forced a configuration addition to the 7.5 foot sphere with the attachment of the airlock. . . .
“For the first generation spacecraft the cosmonaut was seated in the center of the sphere with his back to re-entry portion of the sphere. The capsule had three hatches: the egress hatch, the parachute compartment hatch and an equipment access hatch . . . The parachute compartment was located to the left and rear of the cosmonaut . . . Antennas for the radio system of the re-entry capsule were located 180 degrees from the stagnation point of the heat shield. Even in that location it is possible that heat build-up destroyed all protruding systems as evidenced by the landed VOSTOK. . . .
“The first generation vehicles weighed about 10,430 pounds, after ejection of the nose cone and fairing and separation of the third stage of the booster. . . . The cabin for the first and second generation missions weighed about 5300 pounds.
“In addition, voskhod ii represents an advancement to a more operational type of vehicle with an arrangement indicating its role for extensive Earth-orbital operations.
“The airlock for the voskhod ii mission would represent the farthest evolution of the Soviet manned spacecraft program ... a cylindrical projection to the basic vehicle, positioned within the nose cone and fairing above or forward of the cabin in the antenna region. With respect to the cosmonauts the airlock would be above and to the front as they remained in their seats; its position would be 180 degrees from the stagnation point of the heat shield.” (SBD, 5/13/65, 68-70)

May 14: Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara told the House Appropriations Committee that about $1.2 billion—80 per cent of the allocated money—had been wasted on the abortive b-70 bomber project, Howard Margolis reported in the Washington Post. The question of how much of the money spent was wasted arose when McNamara was asked whether knowledge from the b-70 work would be valuable to other military and civilian projects. McNamara suggested that at least 80 per cent of the money had been wasted, Margolis said. McNamara’s general view had been that substantial “waste” of this sort was unavoidable in the defense program since it was rarely possible to know how valuable a development project would be before large sums had been spent. Margolis added that McNamara suggested minimizing such waste by insisting on good evidence of probable value before allocating large expenditures and, even then, by limiting spending as much as possible until the value of a project was proven.

May 15: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, speaking to the University of Alabama Alumni in Washington, D.C.: “During the five years ending
this month, NASA will have awarded to the University general-purpose grants, project contracts in support of research, and traineeships amounting to over $4.8 million.
“This sum has supported 68 research projects and renewals and the training of 30 graduate students.
“In the last academic year 63 faculty members, 67 graduate students, 51 undergraduate students, and 25 others were supported through NASA research and predoctoral training programs.
“Over the past five years 49 faculty members, 61 graduate students and 73 undergraduate students participated in engineering research sponsored by NASA.
“In addition to this support—and in addition to support for the physics, mathematics and chemistry departments—the Marshall Space Flight Center has guaranteed support for the graduate training program at Huntsville to a total of $750,000 in five years. This Huntsville program permitted the establishment two years ago of resident master’s degree programs in five disciplines. A sixth was added last year. In two years, 2,729 students have participated.” (Text)
May 15: “There are 593 objects in earth orbit today,” said Maj. Gen. Horace A. Hanes (usaf), Commander of the 9th Aerospace Defense Div., at an Armed Forces Week celebration at Selfridge AFB, Mich. He said these ranged from the six-in.-dia. Vanguard satellite through the 90-ft.-dia. Echo satellite. Hanes said the primary mission of his division was to detect and warn the U.S. of a mass ballistic missile attack: “We use radar stations in Alaska, Greenland, and England for this. But to detect satellites and other objects in earth orbit we use these radars plus a variety of other equipment including special optical cameras eleven feet high that weigh 3,000 pounds.” (Pipp, Detroit News. 5/16/65)

May 16: explorer xxiii and pegasus i meteoroid technology satellites continued to transmit useful information after months of operation in the space environment, reported Milton B. Ames, Jr., NASA Director of Space Vehicles Research and Technology.
explorer xxiii, launched by Scout rocket from Wallops Station, Va., Nov. 16, 1964, was last of three S—55 series satellites which were the first spacecraft orbited specifically to measure meteoroid penetrations through spacecraft structures. Performance of explorer xxiii
had been entirely satisfactory, and indications were that it would have a useful life of more than a year, Ames said. Orbital parameters were: apogee, 615 mi. (990 km.); perigee, 290 mi. (467 km.); inclination to the equator, 51.95°.
pegasus i, launched Feb. 16, 1965, was first of a series of three satellites intended to measure meteoroid penetrations of greater structural thicknesses and contained a meteoroid penetration area of almost 2,300 sq. ft. Ames said that although useful results had been obtained with ,0015-in.-thick panels, the data obtained with .008-in.-thick and .016-in.-thick panels had not been fully satisfactory because of difficulties in the operation of the detection system. Still, PEGASUS I had provided significant information leading to improvement of detection systems on the remaining two Pegasus spacecraft. Orbital parameters for PEGASUS I were: apogee, 451 mi. (726 km.); perigee, 311 mi. (500.7 km.); inclination, 31.75°. (nasa Release 65-157)

Lunik V’s purpose was openly said to be a soft landing on the moon, an experiment that might have sent back the first pictures of the moon from the actual lunar surface, and information about the physical nature of that surface. Possibly the Russians were sure they had the problems of a soft landing solved. But just possibly they decided this time to be frank and out in the open about the whole business. After all, why be scared? Look at all the failures the United States has admitted. And right now the Russians have something to console themselves with. It’s called honesty, and its just as good to be distinguished for this as it is for technology.” (Hartford Courant, 5/16/65)

May 17: Robert Hotz said in an editorial in Aviation Week and Space Technology: “With each passing year it becomes more and more apparent that the Soviets agreed to the partial nuclear test ban treaty at a time most advantageous to them and most disadvantageous to us. The Soviets already had tested their nuclear warheads over the entire spectrum—from underwater devices to 50-megaton air bursts including live icbm warheads. The U.S. had not tested any of its nuclear warheads in strategic systems and can only theorize about the effects that high-altitude nuclear blasts in the 50-megaton-and-up range will have on communications and control networks of silo-based icbms and other strategic systems.
“Mr. McNamara has based his defense policy on the belief that he will be able to detect any new Soviet weapons development in time to develop a U.S. counter-measure before the Russians can become operational with their new force. Since several of the new Soviet icbms and an anti-iCBM shown in recent Red Square parades came as a complete surprise to the Western intelligence community, it would appear that this assumption by Mr. McNamara is open to serious challenge. History may prove that Mr. McNamara’s view of the time span available for the U.S. to counter-develop weapons to thwart a Soviet challenge is as wrong as his forecasts of the war in Vietnam.” (Av. Wk., 5/17/65, 21)
• “The Soviet Union, with its May 9 display of missile and space might, has dealt a major blow to the complacency of those persons in the United States who consistently have underestimated the competence of the Russians in these fields,” wrote William J. Coughlin in an editorial in Missiles and Rockets. He continued: “The appearance of Soviet solid-fuel missiles of a type similar to the U.S. Minuteman ICBM indicates that the Soviets finally have overcome the chemical roadblock which until now has made possible the U.S. lead in solids. . . .
“In a film which the Moscow correspondent of the New York Times estimated to be at least three years old, the Soviets also displayed launchings from an underground silo. The combination of these events suggests the Soviets now are in a position to rapidly close the missile gap with the United States to tbe point where it is of no consequence in military calculations. . . .
“In the film release, the Russians for the first time showed their anti-missile missile in action. One sequence was of intercept of an
ICBM. . . .
“The increasing Soviet confidence also is indicated in the space field. The Soviets let it be known more than a month in advance that their next space spectacular could be expected May 9. . . . The launch of LUNIK v obviously was right on schedule. The acknowledgement after launch but in advance of impact that its goal was a lunar soft landing also is a more realistic approach to space developments than previously shown.
“This shift toward a franker attitude is supported by the open admission of the Zond II Mars probe failure by Soviet scientists attending the Space Exploration Symposium in Chicago on May 4.
“At the same time, the Russians released more information on the Soviet space program at the Chicago meeting than heretofore.
“All of this points toward greater maturity in both Soviet missile programs and Soviet space programs. The competition therefore is far keener than many persons in the U.S. have been willing to admit.
“The conclusion is clear. The U.S. cannot afford to let down or it will be far outdistanced in areas which will continue to be vital in its national security and well-being for many, many years.” (Coughlin, M&R, 5/17/65, 74)

149,000	mps or 80% of the speed of light, had been discovered with the 200-in. telescope at Mt. Palomar Observatory, Walter Sullivan reported in the New York Times. It was the most distant of a new generation of five quasars which included cta-102, the object Soviet astronomers had suggested might be transmitting signals under intelligent control. All appeared to be so distant that their life had probably ended during the billions of years required for their light to reach earth. Dr. Allan R. Sandage of Mt. Palomar Observatory said his studies of brightness and velocities of these five quasars and four others previously calculated resulted in evidence supporting the “oscil-

May 19: A 71-ton Little Joe ii rocket fired from White Sands Missile Range, N. Mex., to test the Apollo spacecraft escape system split into fragments three miles above ground following a series of excessive rolls occurring about 25 sec. after launch. The escape rocket fired immediately, however, and carried the 14-ton Apollo boilerplate free of the debris; the parachute recovery system operated normally, lowering the command module to the ground. Apollo program manager Dr. Joseph F. Shea said: “Although the prime objectives of the high altitude abort test were not met, the launch escape system proved its mettle in an actual emergency, which is the purpose for which it was designed.” The launch escape subsystem would be used to propel the spacecraft and its crew to safety in the event of a Saturn launch vehicle failure either on the pad or during powered flight.
Little Joe II had been programed to carry the test vehicle, Boilerplate 22, to 22-mi.-altitude in 89 sec.; an escape motor would propel the spacecraft to a peak altitude of about 35 mi.

May 19: NASA launched a two-part 104-lb. sounding rocket payload from NASA Wallops Station, Va., to measure electron densities and ion composition of the upper atmosphere. Designed as a mother-daughter experiment—with radio signals to be sent from daughter to mother—the payload separated as planned at about 170-mi. altitude and the two-sections reached peak altitude at 605 mi. The sections were programed to rise separately for about 8 min. and reach a distance apart of about 3 mi. Experimental information was radioed to ground stations and no recovery of the sections was required; they impacted in the Atlantic Ocean. Measurement of the differences between the signals of the two devices, monitored by ground stations, was expected to provide more accurate profiles of upper atmosphere electron density. The launching was timed to occur while Canadian satellite alouette was passing nearby, alouette’s instruments would provide a horizontal profile of ionospheric and ion densities and temperatures to be correlated with findings of the mother-daughter experiment.

To obtain information on the background as observed from space and on the signature of ballistic missile rocket motors, the Air Force initiated a series of measurement programs. Instrumented aircraft were used to obtain data on our missile target, from many aspects and in various weather conditions. Concurrently, a spacecraft ‘piggyback’ program for background measurements was instituted. This program has resulted in information of great value and is still collecting valuable data. . . .
“The second area of interest is anti-satellite defense. Last September, President Johnson announced the existence of operational U.S. anti-satellite defense systems. . . .
“The third area of interest is the detection of nuclear detonations in space. The original effort was formerly known as ‘Vela Hotel,’ and has now emerged as the present Vela Satellite Program. . . .
“In 1963 the first pair of Vela Satellites was launched from Cape Kennedy; the second launch occurred in 1964. Both launches were completely successful, and the four satellites are still functioning. . . .
“The last area that I would like to consider in unmanned military space systems is communication satellites—commonly called comsat. Our current philosophy of controlled response has placed an additional emphasis upon communications between field commanders and the highest level of our nation. . . .
“In summary, space is a new environment of activity. We need to exploit it effectively for our own purposes to prevent it from being used against us. We are aware of the many problems confronting us and do not pretend to have all the solutions. But much has been done, and we are building a broad technological base to meet the even greater challenges of the future.” (Text)
May 20: nasa mariner iv was 85 million miles from earth and traveling faster than 48,000 mph, nasa announced.

• A nasa report on its Aircraft Noise Research Program to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics and the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences said: “. . . there is a growing understanding that efforts at a practicable and mutually effective solution will need to be evolutionary in nature, and involve a dedicated attack on all major aspects of the problem. These include the acquisition of definitive information on the manner in which aircraft noises are generated and propagated, and the associated development of efficient methods for the reduction of adverse aircraft noise at its source; the establishment of safe and efficient aircraft operating procedures that minimize and control the exposure of airport community property to undesirable aircraft noise; and the provision of a rational understand-
ing of the specific aircraft noise factors which produce subjective annoyance for various activities and environments of a community population, and of optimum methods for the control and adjustment of community property usage in critical noise areas in the vicinity of the airport.” {CR, 5/27/65)
May 20: aec’s Snap-lOA nuclear reactor, aboard snapshot satellite, launched by usaf into circular polar orbit Apr. 3, automatically shut down on May 16 for unknown reasons, aec announced. Snap-lOA had been producing power for its own telemetry; first indications of malfunction came when telemetry ceased. Telemetry resumed about 40 hrs. later, powered by stand-by batteries, and indicated the reactor had shut itself down and was no longer producing power.
The prototype of future auxiliary power systems, planned to operate at least 90 days, had been operating successfully although the ion engine experiment included in the spacecraft had been shut down when it developed electronic noise. The spacecraft containing the defunct power system would remain in orbit more than 3,000 yrs.; it would take 100 yrs. for the reactor’s radioactive elements to decay to a safe level.
AEC said Snap-lOA had provided valuable information for design of future nuclear propulsion systems, (ap, Wash. Post, 5/21/65; UPI, NYT, 5/22/65, 5; Atomic Energy Programs, 1965,151)

May 22: nasa’s 200-lb. Project Fire II spacecraft—similar in shape to an Apollo command module—was launched into a ballistic trajectory from etr by an Atlas D booster that sent it over 500 mi. into space in test of reentry heating of spacecraft returning from the moon. Some 26 min. later, when the ballistic path of the payload turned it toward earth, a solid-fueled Antares rocket fired for 30 sec., accelerating the payload into the atmosphere at 25,400 mph. As a fireball estimated at 20,000°F formed a shock wave in front of the spacecraft, instruments in its interior radioed information to tracking stations. Tracking reports indicated that the heat probe impacted 32 min. after launch in the south Atlantic about 5,130 mi. southeast of Cape Kennedy. The spacecraft had been dubbed a “flying thermometer” because it was to radio more than 100,000 temperature readings.
First Project Fire flight took place from Cape Kennedy April 14, 1964, and was the fastest controlled in-flight reentry experiment ever conducted. The spacecraft reached a speed of more than 25,800 mph and telemetered many important direct measurements of reentry heating, (nasa Release 65-131; ap, Wash. Sun. Star, 5/23/65)

Hunsaker, former Chairman of the Naca and MIT professor of aeronautics, said:
“We cannot return to the time when the century was young, yet we still need the ingenuity and luck of gifted individuals. It is important to establish an environment with incentives to bring new ideas forward.
“I think of the British Admiralty’s prize for a ship’s chronometer. The chronometer appeared, and changed the entire art of navigation. Lilienthal’s gliding experiments, the Wrights’ flights and Sikorsky’s helicopter were individual contributions, not in government programs.
“Scientists have a favorable climate for their own research provided by the Universities and Foundations, with opportunity for publication and recognition through the learned societies. Could we not devise a plan to bring ideas of individuals before sensitive and wise people who would select wheat from chaff and arrange for development testing of some of the harvest. We must be patient. I am reminded of Dr. Paul Foote’s remark that, for a new chemical, it is usually seven years from test tube to tank car.
“What we must avoid is centralized control of the exploration of ideas by the people responsible for immediate needs. There is nothing more discouraging to an engineer than the statement: ‘We have no requirement for what you are thinking of.’
“Today, U.S. military power is supreme, but our intent and resolve are more in question than our strength. General LeMay says, ‘We must make more determined and longer range plans and commitments. . . . We must look further into the future to foresee the threats that lie ahead.’
“Quantum advances in technology follow availability of scientific knowledge plus creative imagination and financial risk taking. International cooperative effort has been valuable in the past in research, and could be valuable in development work when the threat of destructive purpose becomes less.

•	ComSatCorp may well face competition from foreign satellite com-
munications systems in the next few years, David Sarnoff, chairman of the Board of Radio Corporation of America predicted at the convention banquet of the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Assn, in Washington, D.C.: “We can expect that ultimately Russia will set up a satellite communications system competitive to our own and offer it to other nations on favorable terms determined more by political than economic considerations.”
Mr. Sarnoff advocated creation of “a single, privately owned American company” to handle all international communications currently handled by six private carriers. He argued that, among other benefits, a single “unified carrier” was the only way the U.S. could “deal on equal terms with foreign government [communications] monopolies.
The RCA chairman warned that in only five years the interim agreement between ComSatCorp and the 45 participating nations would be up for re-evaluation. The U.S., he said, “will have to negotiate a new contract under different circumstances and possibly vastly altered bargaining conditions.”
It was technically feasible, Mr. Sarnoff said, that direct radio/TV broadcasting by satellite could be undertaken by 1975. Three equatorial, synchronous orbit satellites powered by nuclear energy, each equipped with a three-TV-channel capability, would be able, he said, to broadcast programs to the entire United States and parts of Canada. He estimated that the three satellites, exclusive of ground stations, would cost $30 million and compared this with the $50 million annual cost to the three major networks for leasing circuits to transmit programs to their affiliated stations or to the $30 million cost of a single large city television station. {WSJ, 5/27/65, 6; Wash.

May 26-28: NASA-sponsored Fifth National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space and St. Louis Bicentennial Space Symposium was held in St. Louis with participants from Government, education, industry, and the scientific community, (nasa SP-82)
NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden, delivering the keynote address, said: “The rate of growth of space activities in the first six years of the space age has been unprecedented in the history of a new field of science and technology but there are signs of attainment of a certain degree of maturity. The most obvious is the establishment, following several years in which available funds nearly doubled each year, of a level of five to five and a quarter billions for congressional appropriations to NASA, or about seven billions for space activities of all agencies at the suitable level. . . .
“Maturity is also indicated by the drastic reduction in the number of unsuccessful missions, the result of increased knowledge and experience in the previously unknown field of space. Thus in calendar year 1958 in the first three months of NASA, four missions were attempted without a single success. In the following year eight of fourteen were successful, whereas in 1964 twenty-five of thirty more difficult missions were successful, a percentage of 83 which has been maintained now for three years. . . .” (nasa Release 65-83; Text, nasa Release 65-165)
Answering the query “What does the future hold in store?” NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller told the Symposium about future manned flight options: “In near-earth space, missions could include low and high inclination, polar, or synchronous orbits to accomplish research, technological, and applications objectives. . . .
“In a low inclination orbit, below the Van Allen belts, the basic problems of keeping men in space for extended periods can be studied, rendezvous and resupply problems could be worked out, and scientific experiments conducted.
“In synchronous orbit, where the spacecraft hovers over a fixed area of the earth all the time, experiments could be carried out which involve manned observations over a given portion of the earth or which use man to assist in the operation of various experimental systems.
“In polar orbit, scientist-astronauts could monitor and observe the entire surface of the earth as it passes beneath the spacecraft, mapping it and surveying most of the world’s resources. . . .
“In earth orbit ... a medium-size manned orbiting research laboratory might be developed. Such a space station would accommodate six to nine men and remain in orbit for up to five years. . . . Resupply vehicles, or space shuttles, could be used for crew rotation and for delivery of equipment and supplies. The laboratory would provide roomy quarters with a shirt-sleeve environment for conducting a wide variety of experiments in space. It would also contain a centrifuge, should it be found essential for reconditioning crew members to withstand the effects of gravity after periods of weightlessness.
“Following this a larger permanent manned orbiting research laboratory accommodating 20 to 30 men, might then be developed, by assembling three or four of the medium-size laboratories in space. Artificial gravity could be provided in the laboratories by rotating them about their axes.
“Possibly the most challenging long-term goal of the entire space program is manned exploration of the planets—especially of Mars.” (Text)
Comparing the space programs of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, said:
“1. In number of earth-orbiting payloads the United States has launched almost three times as many as has the USSR, although the 1965 rate is less than two to one.
“2. In the weight of such payloads, the USSR has put up almost three times as much as has the United States.
“3. In propulsion, the Soviets have from the beginning enjoyed an operational advantage over the United States. However, we are currently making great strides in this regard and it is hoped that we will keep moving up the propulsion ladder so as not to be overtaken again.
“4. In manned space flight, the USSR is ahead of the U.S., not only in hours of flight but also in multi-manned flight and extravehicular activity. So far, the U.S. astronauts have completed 40 orbits of the earth, the Soviet cosmonauts have completed 342 such orbits. Moreover, as our Gemini schedule proceeds and contributes continued progress, we must look for much more activity on the part of the Soviets.
“5. In the application of space developments to directly useful purposes, the United States is well ahead, particularly in such fields as weather observations, navigation, and communications. However, the Soviets have potential capabilities of these types and have already begun to show some actual experience in space communications.
“6. In lunar and interplanetary activity, the U.S. may have an edge with the spectacular success of the Rangers and Mariners. We have developed this advantage, even though the Soviets have made a greater relative commitment in this regard, both from the view of absolute numbers of launches and also in regard to weight of payloads.
“7. Based upon clear knowledge of our own program and upon assertions by the Soviets about theirs, one can reasonably conclude that both countries have manned lunar landing projects under way. It would be impossible to state definitely who is ahead in this regard but I am hopeful that we will turn out to be.
“8. As regards the collection of scientific data from space, both countries have made impressive strides, resulting in a possible advantage to the USSR regarding the effects of space environment on human beings.
“9. Both countries are in a position to make many observations from space, but both countries have pledged not to orbit weapons of mass destruction and have stressed that their programs are dedicated to peaceful uses. I can only speak for this country in regard to our intent and do state that we will maintain our defenses while pledging not to use space for aggressive purposes.”
Dr. Welsh warned: “Let us not expect our space program to proceed indefinitely without some tragedy involving our astronauts.” (Text)
Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, said: “In assessing our growth in space capability in terms of three steps from earth to earth orbit, from
earth orbit to moon, and from moon to planets, it is important to recognize that the first two steps rest on essentially the same technologies. These are technologies which have evolved for decades and which are familiar: chemical energy conversion, relatively common engineering materials, measurement and control systems generally consistent with aircraft and ground technology and microwave communications. However, the third step will demand performance and efficiency well beyond the first two. An entirely new level of technology is needed; nuclear energy conversion, new refractory materials, accuracy of sensors—improved by orders of magnitude—and laser communications. There are the underlying requirements of higher reliability and longer lifetimes than have yet been demonstrated, together with low specific weight.
“The requirement for improvement in this spectrum of space-related technologies will drive them well beyond their present level. The presence of difficult goals can have a profound influence on earth-bound consumer products through the advancement of common fields of technology in addition to opening the gateway to deep space. The NASA program of advanced research and technology embraces most of these elements at least in their fundamental forms. Without this research the space program would soon wither and die. With it, by the year 2000, an enormous influence can be exerted on national prestige and strength.” (Text)
Discussing space projects of the future at the Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space, Dr. Wernher von Braun, Director of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, said: “The reusable vehicle seems to be the key to development of an economical earth-to-orbit transportation system. Passenger conveniences must be improved so that scientists, engineers, technicians, military personnel—and even politicians and journalists—can make the trip.
“One of the methods we have been studying several years combines the experience gained in the x-15 rocket plane program with present Saturn know-how, for building a high performance two-stage rocket “plane”—called the Re-Usable Orbital Transport. It appears entirely practical to develop a vehicle that would not subject passengers to more than three g’s in ascent or descent.
“In the orbital transport under study, the first stage would fly mission paths similar to the X-15, with the second stage, carrying passengers and cargo, launched from a piggy-back position. The second stage would fly into and out of orbit, gliding to a power-off landing after re-entry in the same manner the X-15 does now as routine procedure.
“It would offer passengers who are in a hurry transportation over global ranges with about one-hour flight time. If we can develop a single or two-stage chemical rocket aerospace vehicle and learn to fly it over and over before it is worn out, the high-income traveler should find the operational cost acceptable. But, of course, the thing we must have is the demand—the traffic, cargo, and passengers to make the system economical.
“After we have tried our wings in the immediate earth environment, our next major step in exploring and utilizing the solar system is the moon. And after that, the planets.” (Text)
Dr. Joseph V. Charyk, ComSatCorp president, announced at the Space Symposium that the corporation might invite the aerospace industry to submit detailed proposals for satellites that would connect the television networks to their affiliated stations and would provide new facilities for airplane companies to communicate with aircraft in flight.
Dr. Charyk’s disclosure was a consequence of the American Broadcasting Company’s recent proposal to put up its own comsat to relay TV shows to affiliated stations for rebroadcast to home viewers.
Dr. Charyk said a satellite to relay television programs to affiliated stations involved no new basic engineering problems and offered “real potential, sound economic basis.”
He envisioned a television satellite equipped with 12 channels, three of which would serve each of the four time zones. A satellite of essentially the same design could serve the airplane companies, he noted. (Gould, NYT, 5/29/65, 55)

•	Dr. George Mueller, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space
Flight, said at a news conference in Cocoa Beach, Fla., that Astronauts McDivitt and White would attempt to steer the Gemini 4 spacecraft to a rendezvous with the spent second stage of its booster rocket. This plan was outlined for the flight: When the Gemini 4 spacecraft separated from the second stage six minutes after launching, Maj. James A. McDivitt, as command pilot, would fire jet thrusters to hold a tight formation with the spent stage, which would trail the astronauts by about 300 ft.
Throughout the first orbit, the astronauts would make a complete check of all their systems. At the start of the second orbit they would
begin preparing for Maj. White’s emergence by unpacking life support packs, the maneuvering unit, and the 25-ft. lifeline.
Sweeping over the Indian Ocean during this orbit, they would begin to depressurize the spacecraft cabin and pressurize their spacesuits. Over Hawaii, Maj. McDivitt would maneuver the spacecraft to within 25 ft. of the second stage.
Maj. White would open his hatch and at a point west of Guaymas, Mexico, he would leave the vehicle. That would be about three hours after launching.
Using the hand-gun maneuvering unit, Maj. White would slowly rotate toward the second stage, which is 27 ft. long and 10 ft. in dia. and would be equipped with two flashing lights. The astronaut would carry a 35-mm movie camera to take pictures of the earth, star background, the booster, and the spacecraft.
After 10 min., over Florida, Maj. White would begin returning to the spacecraft. The cabin would be repressurized and the suits depressurized.
Then Maj. McDivitt would fire thrusters so that the spacecraft would move about 16 mi. away from the booster. During the fifth orbit, about three hours later, the Gemini again would be maneuvered so that it would approach the second stage high over Africa.
The craft would close to within 10 ft. this time to determine how well they can approach an orbiting craft, sighting on the flashing lights. (Transcript; Appel, NYT, 5/29/65, 1)

•	A tariff for the use of Early Bird satellites for transmission and reception
of voice, record, data, telephoto, facsimile, television, and other signals was filed by ComSatCorp with the FCC.
Beginning Sunday, June 27, voice channels would be available between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. edt on a daily basis. Minimum rental period, one month; rent, $4,200. Additional consecutive periods would be rented at $140 per day. Voice channels would be two-way. No refunds would be given for interruptions of less than 30 min. or for those caused by solar eclipse. Interruptions of 30 min. or more not the responsibility of the customer would be refunded at roughly $3 per 30-min. interruption. ComSatCorp could request temporary surrender of a voice channel for TV use and, in that event, would refund charges in amounts proportional to the surrender period if it falls between 5
a.m. and 8 a.m. or between 2 p.m. and 9 p.m., or in amounts twice proportional to the surrender period if it falls between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Also beginning June 27, television channels would be available as frequently as feasible. Hours would be 5 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. (Schedule i) and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. (Schedule Ii). Channels would accept standard TV signals. TV channel rentals must be made for at least a 30-min. period. Rent: $2,400 for first 30min., $475 per immediately following 15 min. (Schedule I); $3,825 for first 30 min., $710 per immediately following 15 min. (Schedule ii). Regular channels would be on one-way monochrome. Two-way monochrome and one-way color would rent for an additional 50%. Interruptions of more than 30 sec. and not the responsibility of the customer would be refunded in amounts proportional to the interrupted period. If a customer canceled his application for use of a TV channel, he would be billed as though he had not and would be required to pay any additional charges involved in acquiring temporary use of a voice channel if his application had made such acquisition necessary. TV channels would be rented on a first-come-first-serve basis.
Rates covered only transmissions between Andover, Me., and the satellite. The arrangement whereby refunds would be made for temporary TV use of voice channels was necessary because early bird i cannot handle both kinds of transmissions simultaneously. (ComSatCorp Release)

May 29: nasa successfully launched explorer xxviii Interplanetary Monitoring Probe (Imp-C) from ETR on a three-stage Thor-Delta booster. A slightly longer than planned burn by the third stage engines placed the 130-lb. probe into an orbit with 164,000 mi. (264,040 km.) apogee and 120 mi. (193 km.) perigee instead of the scheduled orbit of 130,000 mi. (209,300 km.) apogee and 120 mi. (193 km.) perigee. Inclination was 34°; period, 5 days, 22 hrs. The spacecraft was equipped with devices to report on the earth’s magnetic field, cosmic rays, and the solar wind throughout its highly elliptical orbit.
Confused telemetry signals from the explorer xxviii for 3% hrs. after launching made it seem the spacecraft had not separated from the
third stage of the booster; however, later signals indicated that all spacecraft systems were operating normally, that separation had occurred.

• An “antirock”—a meteorite composed of anti-matter—may have hit the
earth in 1908, accounting for what was perhaps the most violent explosion ever observed on earth, said a report in Nature by Dr. Clyde Cowan of Catholic Univ. and C. R. Atluri and Dr. Williard F. Libby of the Univ. of California. The 1908 explosion, referred to as the Tunguska meteorite, took place in the air at a height estimated at three miles. Its effects were comparable to those of a nuclear weapon with a yield equivalent to that of 30 million tons of TNT.
The hypothesis had been supported, to some extent, by an analysis of tree rings formed during, before, and after the year of the explosion. It was calculated that an anti-matter explosion would create enough additional atoms of carbon 14 to produce a worldwide enrichment of this radioactive substance. In the study, a 300-yr.-old Douglas fir from Arizona and an oak tree from near Los Angeles were analyzed. Wood was stripped from a number of annual rings from 1873 to 1933. In both trees, the highest content of carbon 14 was from wood formed in 1909, the year after the explosion. Another supporting fact was that the blast left no cloud such as that produced by an atomic or chemical explosion; a mass of anti-matter, plunged into the atmosphere, would be annihilated, leaving no cloud.

May 30: A modified Convair 990A jet transport—nasa’s new high-altitude research laboratory—carried 30 scientists from five countries and a million dollars worth of delicate instruments in a race with a total eclipse over the South Pacific. Path of the eclipse stretched from the northern tip of New Zealand 8,000 mi. east to the coast of Peru. Except for a few small islands, the eclipse was not visible in any heavily inhabited parts of the earth.
Taking off from Hilo, Hawaii, the jet flew at an altitude of 39,500 ft.; in its 9 min. 42 sec. race with the 1,700 mph eclipse, it reached a speed of 587 mph, doubling observation time possible from a ground-based station.

The obvious solution would be to establish one central national agency to handle the collection and reporting of all weather data, giving us the same service at a cheaper price or better service for the same price—or possibly even less. Then each of the agencies which are now duplicating each other’s efforts can use the information for their own purposes.” | Blumenthai, Wash. Post, 5/30/65)

According to the drawing and the text description, molniya i had an airtight cylindrical body with conical ends, one of which contained a rocket engine used to correct the orbit, as well as other solar orientation devices.
Expanding like spokes of a wheel from the cylinder were six long panels of solar batteries to supply electrical power to the satellite for retransmission of signals received from earth. It was equipped with two parabolic antennas, one active, the other in reserve. These were pointed toward earth with a high-precision direction finder for earthbound transmissions, molniya I would make two 12-hr. revolutions around the earth every 24 hrs.

China has also conducted a program to develop rockets,” wrote Cheng Chu-yuan in Military Review. He continued: “Since early 1956, when Peking mapped out the 12-year plan for the development of science and technology, jet propulsion has been listed as one of the 12 major tasks, exceeded only by the use of nuclear energy. The project is under the supervision of the Institute of Mechanics in the CAS.
“In 1958 several new institutes were set up within the Academy—an Institute of Upper Atmosphere Physics in Wuhan; and an Institute of Automation and Remote Control and an Institute of Mechanics and Electronics both in Peking. All of these institutes participate in the rocket program. . . .
“The Science and Technology University of the CAS, the Tsinghua University in Peking, and the Peking Aeronautical Engineering College are the three important centers for training engineers and technicians in rocketry. During the past ten years, more than 3,000 college students, specialists in aeronautical engineering, have been graduated. In 1963 the China Aeronautical Engineering Society was formally established, indicating the rapid growth of technical manpower in this field.
“Since Communist China has several capable men with long years of experience in the rocket field, and since China began her rocket project almost in the same period with the nuclear weapons program, the development of a rocket booster might soon be anticipated. It is quite possible that China may launch her first rocket within the next two or three years.” (Military Review, 5/65, 10F)
May 31: Aerobee 150A sounding rocket, launched from Wallops Station, Va., attained peak altitude of 90.5 mi. (145 km.). Primary experimental objective was to measure spectral irradiance of the stars Spica and Alkaid in the wavelength interval from 1,100 A to 4,000 A. Instrumentation consisted of an ultraviolet stellar spectrometer with photometers and optical telescope. Attitude control was obtained with a modified Attitude Control System (Acs), a roll-stabilized gyro platform, and an optical tracker—the combination known as Strap. The Strap system performed correctly. Due to an incorrect gain setting, the star-tracker failed to lock-on throughout most of the flight. The telescope and spectrometer functioned properly, but obtained no data due to the failure to lock-on. Experiment was conducted by GSFC. (nasa Rpt. srl)

•	Article in Soviet Life by Academician Anatoli Blagonravov described
the “three-directions of modern astronautics”:
“The first is the study of the earth’s upper atmosphere and the portion of space adjoining our planet. . . .
“The second is the study and exploration of . . . the moon.
“The third is the study of solar space, including the nearest planets, Mars and Venus.
“Soviet scientists are working in all three directions.
“The first to be launched, always, are the automatic scouts, followed by men.
“. . . The final stage in the solution of the first problem—exploration of near space—will probably be to set up a permanent manned space observatory-town, with bilateral contact maintained through rockets. Of course, long before this, reliable systems of meteorological sputniks, worldwide television sputniks, navigation sputniks, etc., will have been established. . . .
“Several interesting moves have been taken in the second direction [lunar exploration]. . . . The automatic devices have not yet explored the moon’s surface in detail, have not yet determined the conditions prevailing there. Presumably, they will be followed by animals. Only after the safe return of the ship to earth has been assured will man go to the moon.
“Manned landing will be preceded by numerous earth-moon flights. In the course of these flights the conditions along the entire route will be studied, detailed maps of the lunar surface made, and lunar space investigated. Need I add that all these flights will be made by teams of scientists only ?
“The first stage in the exploration of the moon will be to set up a permanent research station on its surface. . . .
“In the third direction—the exploration of near solar space and near planets—only the first steps have been taken, the first flights of automatic scouts. . . . The interplanetary routes will be explored again and again by automatic stations that will bring back much needed information on space and the nature of the planets to which they are sent. Only then will the first interplanetary expeditions take off. They will carry even larger teams than the lunar reconnaissance expeditions.” (Soviet Life, 5/65, 48)
During May: Dr. Lee A. DuBridge, President of Cal Tech, discussed objectives of the space program and what men hoped to learn through the space program about the moon, the planets, the sun, interplanetary space, and the earth itself. He concluded:
“Man’s growing understanding of the nature and constitution of the universe had led to new advances in our knowledge of physics and of chemistry; and these in turn have led to applications of this knowledge to the development of things which men have found useful. We have never been able to predict in advance what the usefulness would be of new knowledge about the nature of the physical universe. All we know is that, by and large, new knowledge always has proved useful— and often it has proved useful in the most unexpected and unforeseeable ways. No one would have predicted that Newton’s enunciation of the laws of motion would lead to the age of machinery; that Faraday’s experiments would lead to the age of electricity; or that Einstein’s theory of relativity and Bohr’s theory of the atom would lead to the atomic bomb and atomic power.
“We do know one thing: that scientific research which has been aimed at purely practical problems though it often has been of great value, has over a long run been of less value in producing wholly new things than has the research aimed solely at the extension of knowledge. The extension of man’s knowledge is the basic and the overriding purpose of the space exploration program.” (Text, JPL Lab-Oratory, 5/65, 10-12)

June 3-7: NASA’s GEMINI IV spacecraft was launched at 11:16 a.m. EDT with two-stage Titan II booster from the Eastern Test Range and began the four-day space flight of Astronauts James A. McDivitt (Maj., usaf) and Edward H. White, ii (Maj., usaf), who would make 62 revolutions around the earth in 97 hrs. 56 min. Two minutes and 36 sec. after liftoff, the first stage of the booster separated. Six minutes later, traveling at 17,567 mph, the spacecraft was inserted into an orbit with apogee, 174.8 mi. (283.2 km.); perigee, 100 mi. (161 km.); period, 94 min. Original plans had been for gemini iv to be maneuvered within 25 ft. of the burned out second stage of the titan ii booster rocket and for White to approach and possibly touch it during his extravehicular mission. Three hours into flight, ground stations reported that excessive tumbling of the second stage had increased atmospheric drag and that it was orbiting 32 mi. ahead of and 5 mi. below GEMINI IV. Mission Director Christopher Kraft confirmed Command Pilot McDivitt’s suggestion to abandon further attempts at rendezvous because of a potential fuel shortage.
White’s extravehicular activity, planned for the second orbit, but delayed until the third to allow astronauts more preparation time, began at 3:45 p.m. edt. The cabin was depressurized; White, equipped with tether carrying oxygen and communication and with chest pack for emergency oxygen supply, emerged from the spacecraft just past Hawaii. Carrying a modified 35 mm. single-lens reflex camera loaded with color film and propelled by a hand-held, oxygen-jet gun, he went three times to the full length of his 25-ft. tether and then returned, using the gun to halt his motion and prevent his hitting the spaceship. When the gas supply in the gun was depleted, he returned to the spacecraft by gently tugging on the tether line. At one point, McDivitt exclaimed:	“You smeared my windshield, you dirty dog.”
Flight plans had called for a ten-minute walk in space but White remained outside the spacecraft for 22 min. He experienced no disorientation during his “walk.” When he finally heeded commands to return to the capsule, he had difficulty closing the hatch and decided not to reopen it to jettison excess equipment. “It’s the saddest moment of my life,” White said as he reentered the spacecraft.
On June 5 during the 17th orbit, the astronauts spoke to their wives at msc. During the 20th orbit, McDivitt spotted a satellite with “big arms sticking out.” He was unable to identify it positively.
On June 6 during the 48th orbit, trouble developed with the spacecraft’s computer and attempts to repair it with the aid of ground instructions failed. The malfunctioning computer made it necessary for GEMINI IV to reenter on a ballistic trajectory.
Throughout the flight the daily routine of the astronauts included eating, exercise, and performance of medical and scientific experiments. They alternated rest periods. During 12 of the 62 orbits, when gemini iv passed through a heavy radiation area called the South Atlantic anomaly, Astronauts McDivitt and White switched on radiation and magnetic field measuring devices to take readings inside and outside the spacecraft and near their bodies. They also attempted to improve the knowledge of the earth’s terrain through high-quality color photographs; to measure with instruments the electrostatic

charge that accumulates in space and on objects in space; to better define the magnitude and direction of the earth’s geomagnetic field; to test the accuracy of part of a prototype navigational system for future space capsules; to measure heartbeats to try to determine the effects of prolonged weightlessness on functioning of the heart; to determine the effects of limited exercise in space through use of a tension cord; to take high-resolution photographs of cloud formations over the earth to aid weathermen in improved forecasting from weather satellites; to determine more exactly the elevation of the earth’s atmosphere and its layers through use of filtered film; and to determine if long periods of weightlessness might make the bones brittle.
On June 7, to begin reentry, McDivitt fired a 100-lb. thrusting rocket for two minutes, 41 sec.—one second too long—to guide the capsule into an orbit with 156.2-mi (252-km.J apogee and 100-mi. (161-km. perigee. Twelve minutes later, McDivitt fired the retrorockets; 2% min. later he placed the spacecraft into slow rotation to reduce reentry dispersion. Communications with the spacecraft then ceased for about 4 min. as ion-sheath blackout phase of reentry began. GEMINI iv entered the final stage of reentry at 1:07 p.m. edt when the stabilizing chute emerged and damped the oscillations of the descending craft. The main parachute opened shortly afterward and slowed the spacecraft for its final landing at 1:13 p.m. EDT, about 450 mi. east of Cape Kennedy. The landing was 40 mi. off target
because of the one-second error in the firing of the thrusting rockets and one-second delay in the firing of the retrorockets.
Fifteen minutes after splashdown, Navy frogmen, lowered into the water by helicopter, placed a flotation collar around the capsule. Before egressing from the spacecraft to be hoisted to helicopter, astronauts took biomedical data on themselves. About 40 min. later, Majors McDivitt and White were landed by helicopter on the flight deck of the'carrier Wasp. They were taken immediately to the ship’s sick bay for postflight examinations.
Dr. Charles Berry, Chief Flight Surgeon for the astronauts, said after the examinations:	“We have knocked down an awful lot of straw
men. We had been told that we would have an unconscious astronaut after four days of weightlessness. Well, they’re not. We were told that the astronaut would experience vertigo, disorientation when he stepped out of that spaceship. We hit that one over the head.” The most serious problem was fatigue. “Both men were bushed,” said Dr. Berry. Maj. McDivitt had a few flecks of caked blood in his nostrils, caused by the dryness of the mucous membranes from inhaling pure oxygen for so long. X-rays taken of the astronauts’ little fingers and heel bones both before and after the flight to determine if long exposure to weightlessness would cause a substantial loss of calcium were being studied.
Commenting on the historical significance of the Gemini flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator of nasa’s Office of Manned Space Flight, said the flight had included “at least two world firsts”: a record length for two-man flights and the first time a pilot had maneuvered outside a ship with a propulsion gun, which gave him control over his movements.
American astronauts had flown a total of 259 hrs. 34 min. in space; Soviet astronauts had accumulated 507 hrs. and 16 min. (NASA Release 65-158; nasa Proj. Off.; NYT, 6/4/65, 1,15; Wash. Eve.

June 3: In an article suggesting the possibility of catastrophe during the Gemini gt-4 flight, William Hines had said in the Washington Evening Star: “The truth is that the only ‘first’ the United States has a chance to achieve in Gemini 4 is ‘first casualties in space’—and nobody (including the Russians) seek this dubious record.” Commenting on the planned “rendezvous,” he said: “. . . the other and more questionable added spectacular on the present mission—is a risky business of unknown proportions . . . There are several purely technical objections to this exercise. First, it is not part of the original Gemini 4 mission, but an afterthought. Second, the spacecraft was not built for rendezvous. Third, the rocket was never envisioned as a target vehicle and is uncontrollable in space. . . .

He explained: “The only large and still mainly untapped reservoir of energy is from nuclear fuels. The conversion of deuterium in the waters of the ocean to helium is the biggest potential resource. . . There’s just the possibility that Venus may possess an atmosphere of hot steam. If this is so, pushing Venus a little farther from the sun would cause the whole steam atmosphere to collapse into a much cooler ocean. In fact . . . with the energy availabilities I have been talking about, conversion of Venus to a planet like earth would be an entirely feasible proposition.” (NYT, 6/6/65, 70)

•	NASA terminated its contract with the Thiokol Chemical Corp., and its
subcontractor, Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., for development of a 260-in.-dia. solid rocket motor. Reason for the decision was the difficulty encountered by the contractors in processing and welding special steel required for the rocket case and the time which would be required to develop an alternate method.
During a hydrostatic pressure test April 11 of the first rocket case produced under the Thiokol contract, failure had occurred at a pressure
considerably below the normal operating firing pressure with the consequent destruction of the case. A second case, presently about 60% complete, had been constructed by the same method and was subject to the kinds of faults that resulted in destruction of the first case.
Aerojet-General Corp., a second contractor undertaking development of a 260-in. solid rocket motor, was not affected by termination of Thiokol contract, (nasa Release 65-187; Marshall Star, 6/16/65, 6) June 6: Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, told the graduating class of Clark University: “Your country has wisely although belatedly made a firm decision to conduct a vigorous national space program. It is a clear responsibility of each of us to learn what he can about that program, find out what it means to the country as a whole and to the individuals who live here.” He continued: “As we attempt to carry out our responsibilities in educating the general public about space, there are a few concepts which need particular emphasis:
“1. Education. The space program has been a catalyst, a stimulus to education at all levels, with particular attention to science and engineering. . . .
“2. National Security. . . . How much more secure are we, due to improved communications, more accurate navigation, and more complete weather information? How much is it worth to be better informed about potential sources of danger? How can we assess the advantage of developing competence to detect and offset possible aggression from space? How important is it to know that we intend to keep peace and freedom in space so that all who would go there with peaceful intentions are free to do so? I cannot judge the worth of this national security. . . .
“3. Innovations. The space program stimulates the development of new materials, new products, new productive processes, and new managerial techniques. . . .
“4. International Status. A substantial difference in influence in world affairs evolves from whether a country is in a first position or a second position in power. In many respects, a nation’s relative position depends on how it stands in advanced technology. Power and influence in world affairs depend to a great degree upon the technological capability of a nation. . . . The ideal picture is that of a nation strong in ideas, in technology, in freedom, in standard of living, and in military power to protect the viability of the other prestige ingredients. The space program, effectively and imaginatively conducted, contributes positively to all of those ingredients. Of even greater importance is the potential impact the space program can have on world peace through substituting competence in space exploration for competence in building implements of aggression. ...
“5. Economics. Combining the best talents in management, in engineering, and in science, with the most modern facilities available, the net result of the space program is the production of progress. . . .” (Text)

Second, the exploratory development of materials in advance of specific system requirements. Third, the evaluation of new materials for potential applications. And fourth, the investigation of economical manufacturing techniques and equipment. The importance of vigorous efforts in all of these areas is obvious when we remember that it takes from 5 to 10 years to translate a laboratory result into hardware.
“. . . the people of the Air Force Materials Laboratory are making significant contributions to present and future Air Force systems. Their recent accomplishments include development of methods for ultrasonic detection of corrosion in aircraft fuel tanks and for installation of corrosion-resistant rivets in aircraft skins.

expenditures have risen from $100,000 in 1961 to $1.3 million to be spent by faa alone in 1965,” faa Administrator Najeeb E. Halaby told a National Aircraft Noise Symposium in New York City. He warned: “If we fail to make progress in reducing noise . . . pressure may perhaps ultimately exclude the availability of aviation facilities to our centers of trade and commerce. I feel it is essential that we all recognize the price that we may be forced to pay for a tolerable environment next door to our airports.” (Text)

June 11: At a news conference at NASA Manned Spacecraft Center on the Gemini GT—4 spaceflight, Astronaut McDivitt said: “I saw three things that looked to me like they were satellites on the earth. I saw two over the Pacific, I guess. One . . . near Hawaii. ... I saw a white object and it looked like it was cylindrical and it looked to me like there was a white arm sticking out of it. . . . We saw another one at night. It looked like just a pin point of light in the sky. . . . And I saw another one over the western Pacific again just shortly before I got into the sunlight on the windshield. . . . The only one I could even define the shape of at all was the first one and it looked a lot like an upper stage of a booster.”
Astronaut White commented: “. . . we were looking to find out: Could man control himself in space? And the answer is yes, man can control himself in space.” McDivitt continued: “The first thing we learned was that the Gemini 4 is a liveable spacecraft for at least four days.” (Transcript; NYT, 6/12/65, 3)

•	Laser beams could be used to track satellites, a group of scientists re-
ported at a news briefing at nasa Goddard Space Flight Center. The briefing followed a two-day meeting discussing efforts to track explorer xxii and explorer xxvii satellites which were orbiting the earth at a height of about 700 mi. Dr. Henry Plotkin, Head of Gsfc’s Optical Systems Branch, said the experiments had indicated that: 1) a beam of laser light from the ground could be directed with sufficient accuracy
to strike satellite reflectors; 2) turbulence in the atmosphere would not break the beam enough to interfere with its lighting up the satellite; 3) very short bursts of light from lasers could be used to measure the range of a satellite precisely by means of timing the flight and rebound of the pulse; 4) reflected light could be photographed against a stellar background to provide angles by which the satellite could be identified very accurately.

The blue galaxies resembled quasi-stellar radio sources (“quasars”) except that they did not emit strong radio waves. They appeared to be 500 times more plentiful than quasars and numbered about one to every 100,000 normal galaxies. According to Dr. Allan Sandage of Mt. Palomar, the newly discovered blue galaxies substantiated the theory that the “universe is a finite, closed system originating in a ‘big bang,’ that the expanding universe is slowing down, and that it probably pulsates once every 82 billion years.” (Sullivan, NYT, 6/13/65, 1, 81)
•	British broadcasting Co. filed a petition with the fcc to request halv-

•	U.S. News and World Report suggested that the success of the Gemini
GT—4 flight should prompt reassessment of the U.S. position in the race with the Soviet Union. Two conclusions were noted:
“1. In the civilian space race, White’s self-propelled ‘space walk’ and McDivitt’s ability to maneuver the spaceship put the U.S. ahead in at least two key areas and gave the U.S. a fighting chance eventually to overtake the Russians in the race to the moon. . . .

Those persons who will be working in space will obviously have much to do in securing their bodies in . . . [the weightless state]. As for the so-called psychological barrier that was supposed to be insurmountable by man preparing to confront the cosmic abyss alone, I not only did not sense any barrier, but even forgot that there could be one.” (Wetmore, Av.

June 14: That antimatter could exist in aggregations of particles, not only as isolated subatomic particles, was demonstrated by physicists studying under AEC funds at Columbia Univ. Nevis Cyclotron Laboratory and Brookhaven National Laboratory. Protons placed in Brookhaven’s AGS synchrotron were hurled at almost the speed of light and energy of 30 billion electron volts at a target of beryllium; scientists used a high-transmission mass analyzer to detect anti-deuterons in the debris of collisions between high-energy protons and nuclei of atoms in the target. Research report appeared in Physical Review Letters. The existence of the antideuteron had been predicted theoretically, but its actual production indicated that properties of the nuclear force were closely mirrored in the world of antiparticles and that an antiworld would be conceivable in terms of contemporary nuclear physics.

•	Discussing Russian-American cooperation in space in a letter to the
editor in the New York Times, Donald Spero, a student at Columbia Univ. School of Engineering, said: “. . . technical integration of the U.S. and (assumed) Russian lunar programs is out of the question. Hardware for every phase of the Apollo program has already been designed and built. . . .
“The integration of a Russian booster and an American capsule would be a technical impossibility. . . . The only plausible alternative for initial lunar exploration would be to include a Russian cosmonaut in the Apollo crew or one of our astronauts as a member of the Russian expedition. Even if problems of language and pilot training could be overcome, political and propaganda considerations eliminate this alternative.
“Realistic possibilities for cooperation lie in the areas of unmanned
probes, communication and weather satellites, and eventually manned planetary exploration and establishing of lunar bases.” (NYT, 6/14/65)
June 14: A New York Times editorial by Harry Schwartz concerning Soviet-American cooperation in space: “The real issues relate to the advantages and disadvantages in the moon race itself—including, of course, its propaganda aspects.
“The argument that cooperation will not mean significant savings is strongest for the immediate future, but its force weakens rapidly as one extends the time horizon of both nations’ future space efforts. Even in the next year or two both countries could gain from a full pooling of space technology and knowledge because this would reduce the number of Gemini-type flights each would have to engage in. . . .
“Major cost advantages can certainly be gained by agreement on a division of labor between the Soviet Union and the United States, if it is accompanied by a decision to send mixed crews on major missions. For example, a pooling of information and resources might permit one country to focus on the hardware needed for the moon trip, while the other concentrated on the equipment needed to send men to Mars. . . .
“But the major savings from real Soviet-American cooperation in space might come from another direction entirely. In both countries influential voices are urging major military efforts looking to the creation of armed national space fleets . . . The time is past due for decision between space cooperation, or the extension of a rivalry that could cost both Soviet and American peoples dearly—and perhaps not solely in terms of vast sums wasted.” (Schwartz, NYT, 6/14/65, 31, 32)
June 14-21: pdp-5 and PD P-8 (Program Data Processing) computers, reported to simultaneously collect and analyze oceanographic data and to use data received by radio from artificial earth satellites to fix the position of ships, were displayed at the Ocean Science and Ocean Engineering Conference and Exhibit in Washington, D.C. pdp-5 had first been used by the U.S. Coast Guard during the 1964 International Ice Patrol season to predict the speed and course of icebergs drifting into major ship lanes.

June 14-25: “Science in the Sixties,” a seminar sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, was held in Cloudcroft, N. Mex. In
opening remarks, Maj. Gen. Don Ostrander, afosr Commander, said: “The purpose of these Cloudcroft meetings is to stimulate ideas—to act as an intellectual catalyst. . . . We all have a responsibility to try to understand the complex interrelationships between science and technology, and between technology and national defense; through understanding, to participate in the excitement and urgency of the creative turmoil which is such an inescapable part of the age in which we live!”
Historian A. Hunter Dupree, professor of history at the Univ. of California (Berkeley) and a consultant to NASA, said that scientists with a negative attitude regarding the Nation’s manned space flight activities had a laboratory-limited view of scientific endeavor and had lost perspective of the contributions made to American and world science through exploration and survey expeditions in the field. He pointed out the relationship of the Pacific voyages of Capt. Cook to Darwin’s later theory of evolution and said: “One can as little predict the results of space exploration as Captain Cook could have predicted Darwin’s theory.”
According to Dupree, it was the general expansion of knowledge that would lead to later fruitful developments. But to justify these developments immediately or to justify exploration in terms of predictable developments would be a mistake. (Simons, Wash.

An artificial frog’s eye which could be sent to the surface of Mars to detect living organisms was described by Warren McCullough and Louis Sutro. Research had revealed there were four varieties of ganglion cells in the eye of the frog—each processing different information. The MIT scientists had proposed the following scheme to nasa: the artificial eye would be coupled to a microscope in a tiny computer. Samples of Martian soil would be seen by the frog’s eye through the microscope. When movement was detected, the eye would inform the computer, which would decide whether a picture of the moving organism should be taken for relay back to earth. (Simons, Wash. Post, 6/18/65, Al)
Theories on biological rhythms were proposed by Colin Pittendrigh of Princeton Univ. at the AFOSR seminar. He suggested that oscillations or biological rhythms were serving a fundamental function that was not yet fully identified and that all organisms undergo oscillations with a periodicity that matches that of the external world—roughly 24 hrs. Light, even in negligible amounts, could alter these oscillations. In Pittendrigh’s view, once the true face of biological clocks—time measuring mechanisms innate in all living organisms—was seen, science would have vital clues to how life developed on earth and how biological rhythms determine what it is all living things do. (Simons, Wash. Post, 6/22/65, A6)
Star collisions were suggested by astrophysicist Thomas Gold of Cornell Univ. as one way that energy now associated with a host of new objects observed throughout the universe was released. He said a prime candidate for providing the right kind of environment for star collisions was elliptical galaxies. In their predeath condition, elliptical galaxies start to lose stars that comprise the galaxies. Star loss causes the galaxies to shrink and become denser. The remaining stars
rush in and out through the heats of these galaxies at speeds possibly as high as 24 million mph—greatly enhancing the chance for star collisions. The effect of collisions at these speeds would be to release amounts of energy equivalent to that calculated to be stored in the quasi-stellar radio sources. Gold had not observed such star collisions, but dense regions on the “brink of destruction” had been detected. “We must inspect each in turn,” Gold said, adding, “maybe we will learn that something totally different is involved, a new type of energy source that physics doesn’t know about.” (Simons, Wash. Post, 6/23/65)

•	In surprise move, U.S.S.R. landed the world’s largest plane at the
International Air Show, Le Bourget, France. Designated An-22, the aircraft could carry 720 passengers or 80 tons of cargo and would weight 250 tons with maximum cargo. Powered by four turboprop engines, each with twin propellers rotating in opposite directions, the aircraft, with maximum load, would have a range of 3,100 mi. at cruising speed of 420 mph. Maximum speed would be 460 mph; maximum altitude 36,000 ft. An-22 would require 4,300 ft. for takeoff but only 2,600 ft. for landing.

•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb, in Subcommittee of the Senate
ate Committee on Appropriations’ hearings on the requested $5.26 billion appropriation request for NASA in fy 1966, said:
“Recent events have clearly demonstrated two important facts about space activities. First, the United States has shown that it can successfully build and launch complex spacecraft to measure the space environment over large regions of our solar system and to extend our knowledge of our neighboring space bodies. We have developed a capability to produce large launch vehicles, to test them, and to launch them successfully. We are producing the space hardware for environmental testing that will prove out our concepts and engineering for the large launch vehicles and spacecraft that will be required to operate out to and on the moon and meet all the demands of our other difficult undertakings. We have successfully developed space technology for improved communications and weather reporting and forecasting systems. The Ranger program, completed with Ranger IX, provided
17,000	closeup pictures of the moon that have not only given us a better understanding of its topography but may reveal totally unexpected processes taking place below the surface.- The first two manned flights of the Gemini program verified the system for using man in space, the capability of the Gemini spacecraft, the capability of an astronaut to operate outside of his spacecraft, and the utility of
the ground net and mission control, and provided the first tests of some of the equipment designed to accomplish rendezvous and docking. They also served as an orbiting space laboratory with several experiments included on both flights.
“The second major fact demonstrated by recent space events is that the Soviet Union continues to make a major commitment to its aeronautical and space activity. In late 1964, they launched the first multi-manned mission with the three-man Voskhod I satellite. So far in this calendar year, they have launched 17 Cosmos satellites; in the Voskhod II flight they achieved the first extravehicular activities of man in space; in April they placed in orbit Molniya I, their first active communications satellite; in May they launched a Lunik spacecraft to the moon with a successful midcourse correction but apparent terminal failure; and only a few days ago they launched another Lunik spacecraft to the moon with an apparent unsuccessful midcourse correction. They, too, are expanding upon a sound basis for both manned and unmanned activities in space. The growth of their space activity is quite apparent. The exhibition in Paris yesterday afternoon of a new very large air transport indicates the same kind of emphasis on equipment to use the earth’s envelope of air.
“In aeronautics, it is important to note the increasing tempo of our research in not only the aerodynamics, loads and structures, propulsion, and operating problems of supersonic flight, but hypersonic flight as well. There is a resurgence of interest in airbreathing propulsion in the form of advanced turbojet and ramjet engines to meet the requirements of supersonic and hypersonic transports and to make them competitive with transports operating in the subsonic range. And of course, we are also engaged at the other end of the speed spectrum in our work with vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. . . .”
In response to questioning, Mr. Webb said: “A substantial amount of time is now being put into aeronautics by our top people. Remember, we have to go through the air to get to space. The use of thin wall structures and the use of power delivered by engines all come out of the same research competence which we have.
“. . . I have been asked once or twice to consider whether NASA should take on the management and development of prototypes and all other factors relating to the building of a supersonic transport.
“Each time I have pointed out that we spend a large number of our dollars through the military services because they have the procurement capability. They are the only people in the U.S. Government today who know how to let a contract, monitor a contract, and take delivery on large airplanes and large numbers of airplanes. We use them for that purpose in boosters where they have already developed the competence; and in new boosters like SATURN V, we also use their contract administration and their Project 60 for engines. . . .” (Ind.

June 16: Max Quatinetz of nasa Lewis Research Center addressed International Powder Metallurgy Conference in New York. He discussed LRC research in adding fibered metals to tungsten to strengthen that metal, which has a high melting point but is brittle and difficult to work. Quatinetz described a new method of producing the fibered compounds
—extrusion of powdered metals. Researchers had formed tungsten composites containing high-temperature additives such as oxides, borides, nitrides, and carbides; they had noted increases in the metal’s stress-rupture life of up to 50 times. Quatinetz observed that the new method of fibering would have wide potential application in materials research, (lrc Release 65—45)
June 16: Dr. Werner R. Kirchner, vice president and manager of Solid Rocket Operations, Aerojet-General Corp., received aiaa’s James H.

June 17: Charles W. Mathews, manager of the Gemini program, and Astronauts James McDivitt (Maj., usaf) and Edward White ii (Maj., usaf) received NASA’s Exceptional Service Award from President Johnson in a special White House ceremony. Introducing the President, NASA Administrator James E. Webb said: “. . . we . . . should never forget that at the beginning of the space age, in 1957, the challenge of this new frontier which was laid down to us was first met by the man who is now the President of the United States and who has so graciously invited us here today to indicate again his interest in, and the importance he attaches to, the new systems we have developed for building our national competence in space and using the science and technologies acquired to work toward a peaceful world and a better world.
“This great leader of our nation, and of the Free World, is still pioneering, this time on an even more difficult frontier where we must learn to master the restrained but decisive use of the powers which technology gives our nation. Those of us who are responsible for the build-up of our new base of technology believe that power, based on advanced technology, can provide new means to hold back those ruthless forces which answer not to the need of all men for security, freedom, dignity, and opportunity. The pioneering which President Johnson is engaged in today on this new frontier is, if anything, more important than his pioneering actions in 1958 to create our national program in aeronautics and space.
“Seldom in the history of the world has one man had to play so vital a role in developing the tools of modern science and technology and then in the development of a national capability to use them to achieve cooperation toward a world consistent with our own ideals and those we have sought for others as well as ourselves.”
Accompanying citations noted “outstanding contributions” and singled out Major White as “the first man to engage in self-propelled extra-vehicular activity.” Terming the three “the Christopher Columbuses of the 20th century,” Mr. Johnson said their work had nudged the world toward greater international cooperation. “Men who have worked together to reach the stars are not likely to descend together into the depths of war and desolation,” he said. Later, the recipients were guests at a luncheon held by Vice President Humphrey and received accolades in both the House and Senate. A crowd estimated at
50,000	applauded the motorcade as Mathews and the astronauts rode to the Capitol.
In the evening, Majors White (usaf) and McDivitt (usaf) narrated a 20-min. film of the GEMINI IV flight for the chiefs of foreign diplomatic missions. President Johnson, in a surprise appearance, told the astronauts to “take the Presidential plane and travel outside this country again.” He said: “Many people in many lands were thrilled by what you have done. I want you to join our delegation in Paris and go out among the friendly peoples of the earth to share with them the excitement and thrills of your experience.”
Astronauts White and McDivitt then returned to the White House where provisions had been made for them and their families to remain overnight. (Text; Clopton, Wash. Post, 6/18/65, Al, A3; upi, N.Y. Her. Trib., 6/18/65; Semple, NYT, 6/18/65, 1, 13; Sehlstedt, Balt. Sun, 6/18/65)

June 17: Commenting on anxiety about the Soviet Union’s capability of delivering strategic weapons from near space, Dr. S. Fred Singer said in an article in Reporter: “If a bomb is released from a satellite without giving it any propulsion, it will stay with the satellite and simply blow it up. For a bomb from a satellite to be directed to a point on earth, it must be propelled not only with a lot of rocket power but also with exceedingly fine guidance. In principle, this can be done from a satellite or from the moon or even from the planet Pluto; but the cost and complexity is enormously greater than that of an equally effective ICBM buried deep in the earth itself.” (Reporter, 6/17/65, 14)
• In what he termed “Coming of Age in Houston,” William Hines wrote in the Washington Evening Star of “a new, mature outlook on the part of nasa.” He said: “There was a conscious effort to deglamorize (but not depersonalize) the [Gemini 4] astronauts, and to' focus attention on the mission rather than on celebrities who would subsequently tell their stories in Life. The decision not to give the spacecraft a name and to use the radio call sign ‘Gemini 4’ was a step in this direction.
“The determination of NASA to rid itself of what has been called the ‘Hollywood syndrome’ and handle space flights as transcendental news events instead of tawdry theatrical productions did not come easily, or without prodding from the outside. But once the decision had been made not to try any longer to fool all the people all the time, a new era in public understanding of space dawned.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 6/17/65)
June 18: usaf Titan iii-c, launched from the Eastern Test Range, became the most powerful rocket known to have been lofted and the first liquid-fuel spacecraft to be lifted from its pad with solid-fuel rockets. Two 120-in.-dia., 86-ft.-long solid strap-on boosters generated a peak thrust of 2.647 million lbs. % sec. after ignition to propel the liquid-fuel core vehicle to an altitude of 24 mi. Less than two minutes after lift-off, the boosters were jettisoned by firing of 16 small rockets. The liquid-fuel engines of the 127-ft., three-stage core vehicle then fired a
474,000-lb. thrust burst that injected the vehicle’s third stage (transtage) with 29,285-lb. lead ballast and instrument payload into an orbit with apogee, 116.2 mi. (187 km.); perigee, 110.4 mi. (177.7 km.); period, 88.1 min; inclination to the equator, 32.175°. This was the heaviest payload ever orbited; insertion velocity was 25,584 fps.
The solid-fuel motors, made by United Technology Center, were formed in lO-ft.-dia. segments stacked inside metal casings. Adding two segments to each of the two five-segment boosters used would permit Titan m-c to put 32,000 lbs. into orbit. Payload could be increased to 40,000 lbs, using 13-ft.-dia. segments of another type already test-fired by UTC. Liquid stages used nitrogen tetroxide and Aerozene 50 (a 50/50 mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical dimethylhydra-zine) as the oxidizer and fuel; the propellants ignited hypergolically. A series of twelve Titan ill—c tests was projected.
Most powerful rocket previously launched was NASA’s Saturn I, which produced 1.5 million lbs. thrust. The most powerful known Soviet rocket, which orbited voskhod i and voskhod ii, had been
rated by American experts at 800,000-900,000 lbs. thrust. The two-stage Titan II that launched GEMINI III and GEMINI IV into orbit produced 430,000 lbs. of thrust. (Clark, NYT, 6/19/65, 1; ap, Benedict, Wash. Post, 6/19/65, A3; Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 6/19/65; Av. Wk., 6/28/65, 16-19)
June 18: A briefing given by nasa Administrator James E. Webb to President Johnson and the Cabinet in session said that the success of the last two Gemini missions “has proved the design and confirmed the results of the ground tests, has increased our confidence in the reliability of the over-all Gemini systems, and has enabled the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to advance the Gemini program such that rendezvous and docking are now scheduled during calendar year 1965.” (Text)
•	NASA launched 3.5-ton Aerobee 350, new two-stage research rocket,
from Wallops Station, Va., in first flight test. The 52-ft.-long, 22-in.-dia. rocket carried 367 lbs. of performance instrumentation to peak altitude of 235 mi. and impacted in Atlantic Ocean 160 mi. from launch site.
Designed and developed by Space-General Corp., Aerobee 350 had a main stage “sustainer” propelled by four liquid-fuel engines, each developing 4,100 lbs. thrust. Booster stage used a solid propellant Nike motor with 51,000 lbs. thrust. Booster and sustainer stages fired simultaneously, with the booster burning out and separating about
3.2	sec. later. The rocket would boost a minimum-weight payload of 150 lbs. to an altitude of 290 mi. and a maximum payload of 500 lbs. to 210 mi. (Wallops Release 65—37; nasa Rpt. srl)

basis equal in priority to the Apollo program,” said Rep. John W. Wydler (R-N.Y.), member of the House Science and Astronautics Committee, in a letter to the editor in the New York Times. He suggested the following steps be taken:	“The first M.O.L. flight is
scheduled from two and one half to three years from now. This
should be speeded up at least a year and the necessary sacrifices made to achieve it. The Gemini capsules required for the M.O.L. project should be ordered at once. To achieve our goals effectively the manned earth orbiting program should be placed under military control. . . .
“I believe the only way the Department of Defense can meet its responsibilities in ‘near space’ is to assume direction of the manned earth orbiting program. It should reorganize the U.S. Air Force into the U.S. Aerospace Force and make it truly that. . . .
“The decision we must make is not whether there will be military control of space but rather whether that control will be Russian or our own. . . .” (NYT, 6/19/65, 28)
June 19: The Space Act of 1958 may have unwittingly provided competition that is getting results, said an editorial in the Cleveland Plain Dealer: “There was conjecture then, and there is conjecture now, that nasa and the Air Force duplicate efforts in the parallel development of rockets. There are rumors of smouldering controversy.
“But yesterday’s dramatic blastoff of the triple-barrelled Titan 3-C by the Air Force, coming closely on the heejs of NASA’s sensational Gemini performance, indicates the competition, thus far is beneficial to both.” (Cleveland Plain Dealer, 6/19/65, 23)

“The Air Force, for its part, must now try to prove Titan m-c’s reliability over the long haul . . . Gen. Joseph S. Bleymaier Jr., head of the Titan m-c program, said it is his goal to make every one of the 12 shots in the Titan ill—C development series a 100% success.
“Equally important with reliability is cost. Bleymaier says the Titan iii-c can be produced in quantity for $12.8 million, or just a little more than half the $22 million it is estimated nasa’s Saturn ib will cost. Titan m-c’s $800 million development cost is but a fraction of what NASA will have spent to get the first Saturn IB off the ground.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 6/19/65)

•	The U.S. showing at Le Bourget was discussed by Robert Hotz in an
Aviation Week and Space Technology editorial: “The United States is presenting a sorry spectacle at the 26th Paris Air Show [June 11-21] that does grave injustice to its genuine aerospace capability in relation to its principal competitors, including the Soviet Union. As the show
draws to a close, only a bold stroke of public relations, such as jetting Astronauts White and McDivitt with their Gemini capsule to Le Bourget for a weekend finale would offer any chance for the U.S. to recoup the prestige lost last week through the combination of top-level government indifference, official naivete and the stifling channels of interagency bureaucracy between the various government departments involved in the U.S. show effort. . . .
“For the past two Paris air shows, the NASA exhibit has been a major sensation, convincing Europeans of U.S. technological leadership. This year, nasa was conspicuously absent. Even frantic pleas from the French to have Astronaut John Glenn appear to match the Soviets’ Yuri Gagarin were strangled in the maze of interdepartmental coordination. . . .
“The net result of this sad combination of government bungling at Le Bourget has been to spend large sums of the taxpayers’ dollar to create the impression that the United States is resting smugly on its technical oars, complacently relying on rapidly obsolescing military hardware for the present and craftily confident this aging equipment can be foisted on its European allies in the near future.” (Hotz, Av.

June 22: mariner iv spacecraft was functioning well on its mission to Mars, but the public should not “expect too much” from the photographs of Mars it was scheduled to take July 14, NASA scientists said during a press briefing. It was conjectural whether the 21 photo* graphs the Mars probe would take would be clear enough to disprove or verify the theories held by some scientists that there are canals and some form of life on Mars. Scientists who would study the photographs pointed out that 21 pictures would only enable them to see 1% of Mars. Nevertheless, any pictures of the surface would be far superior to the best observations now obtainable with earth-based telescopes.
The first few photographs might be made public immediately after being received, but the others probably would not be released until they had been studied for weeks or months. (Transcript, Sehlstedt, Balt. Sun, 6/23/65; Hill, NYT, 6/23/65, 7)

June 29: NASA successfully conducted an Apollo boilerplate pad abort test at White Sands Missile Range to check the launch escape system. The test simulated an abort from ground level, using the Apollo launch escape system for propulsion. This type of abort would be necessary in an actual mission if serious trouble developed with the Saturn launch vehicle just before or during ignition of the Saturn engines.
Boilerplate 23A, the command module used for this test, powered by the launch escape rocket’s 155,000 lbs. of th rust, traveled 5,000 ft. above the range. Eleven sec. after ignition was signaled from the blockhouse, canards deployed near the top of the escape motor, causing the spacecraft to pitch aerodynamically to a blunt-end-forward position. Three seconds later, the tower jettison motor ignited, removing the tower and boost protective cover from the spacecraft. The forward (apex) heat shield was jettisoned .4 sec. later to uncover the parachute containers. Dual drogue parachutes were deployed by mortars from the upper deck two seconds after the LES was jettisoned. They slowed the spacecraft’s descent, then disreefed to stabilize the module in a blunt-end-forward position. When the drogue parachutes were jettisoned, three pilot chutes were deployed to extract the three main chutes from their containers. The main parachutes were deployed in reefed condition, then disreefed to lower the spacecraft to a gentle landing about one mile from the launch site. The flight sequence took about one minute. This was the first Apollo boilerplate to be reused, (nasa Release 65-202; upi, Chic. Trib., 6/30/65; msc Roundup, 6/25/65, 1)

June 30: Strongly urging greater emphasis on U.S. aeronautics and aviation than now exists. Sen. A. S. (Mike) Monroney (D—Okla.), Chairman of Senate Aviation Sub-committee, addressed Air Force Association in Dallas, Tex.
“I am afraid some people, and I mean people of high stature and great influence, seem bent on relegating aeronautics to a secondary position. This I think is a crucial mistake. In aeronautics we stand on the threshold of a boundless upsurge which may well dwarf what has been achieved by aviation over the past 61 years.
“Also, the economic productivity of aeronautics makes dollars . . . and sense. It means money in the bank, or rather gold in Fort Knox. On the other hand, I don’t know of any scheme . . . and I doubt that one will emerge within this century . . . for fighting the balance of payments deficit in outer space.
“There simply are no dollars floating around between here and the moon. For the time being, outer space commerce just doesn’t seem to be in the cards. And as long as this is the situation, I don’t think we should banish aeronautics to the back seat ... or have a NASA budget which is better than 08 percent spacecraft and less than 2 percent aircraft. And this in spite of the fact that NASA and its forerunner, naca, were ostensibly founded to serve aeronautics!
“I am not saying this to downgrade space, but to suggest that we strike a balance based on how the national interest and economy are served best. . . . This widening disparity between NASA’s space and aeronautical efforts . . . this wall flower treatment of the airplane ... is a reckless gamble, economically, politically and militarily, that will come back to haunt us in the future. My criticism, by the way, is not directed at the level of competence in that agency but at the lack of programming of aeronautical goals and the failure to mobilize this nation’s brain power on behalf of aviation. It seems to me the real deficiency is that the well qualified aeronautical talent in NASA js so far down in the hierarchy that these men rarely ever get involved in the decision making. It’s crystal clear that other nations, the Russians included, have cut this Gordian knot and are rapidly filling the vacuum which we so invitingly created for them. . . .” (Text; ap, NYT, 7/2/65)

During June: Interviewed in Data, NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff discussed basic research in the NASA program:
“The term basic is employed for two reasons. The basic research program involves elements which undergird everything we do in aeronautics and space. Such areas as materials, fluid physics, electrophysics and applied mathematics form a common base for all of our work. In addition, most of this program is carried on at a fundamental level, that is, at the atomic and molecular level. If we select, for example, the field of materials we can observe that nearly everything we do in atmospheric and space flight is limited in some way by materials. . . .”
Asked about the role of industry in NASA’s advanced research and technology program, Dr. Bisplinghoff said:
“About 75 per cent of the oart research and development budget is spent outside the nasa organization. This money goes to university and research institutes and to industrial contractors capable of carrying out the advanced work making up this program.” (Data, 6/65, 22-25)

• Harold B. Finger, Manager of nasa-aec Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, discussed nuclear-rocket technology in Astronautics & Aeronautics: “The recent reactor test experience shows that nuclear rockets can be made available to furnish thrust at high specific impulse for many possible post-Apollo missions. Whatever direction the future space program may take—whether toward extensive manned lunar exploration, unmanned solar-system exploration, or manned planetary exploration—the performance advantages of nuclear rockets will be available, valuable, and, certainly for the latter mission, necessary. Through this program the country will have the options it must have in selecting future missions. For the manned planetary missions, which they can perform for all planetary opportunities, nuclear rockets offer such substantial spacecraft weight reductions, and associated savings in cost, that no less-efficient form of spacecraft propulsion could be seriously considered. . . .”	(A&A, 6/65, 34--35)

“Present space systems lag the launch vehicles in both development status and sophistication. But we can expect considerable performance improvement by the use of more-sophisticated space propulsion systems. Moreover, ground facilities that simulate the space environment are becoming available.

July 1: Gen. William F. McKee (usaf, Ret.) was sworn in as Federal Aviation Agency Administrator—less than 24 hrs. after confirmation by the Senate—in a White House ceremony. President Johnson, presiding, announced that General McKee’s primary task would be development of a supersonic transport (Sst). Mr. Johnson had approved five recommendations of the President’s Advisory Committee on Supersonic Transport: “Those five recommendations . . . are: first, the next phase of design covering an 18-month period beginning about August 1, 1965; second, the four manufacturers—Boeing Company, Lockheed Aircraft Company, General Electric Company, Pratt & Whitney Division of United Aircraft—be invited to continue this phase of the program; third, the faa Administrator be authorized to enter into contracts with the airframe manufacturers to undertake detailed airframe design work and test them over the next 18 months; fourth, the faa Administrator be authorized to enter into contracts with the engine manufacturers to construct and test over the next 18 months demonstrator engines to prove the basic features of the engines; and five, and finally—and very importantly—that the Congress be requested to appropriate—Senator Magnuson—the necessary funds to initiate the next phase of the program. And for this purpose I shall request an appropriation of $140 million.”
Ira C. Eaker commented in the San Antonio Express: “When McKee succeeds in his SST mission, as I believe he will, any citizen will be able to buy a $50 ticket for a flight from Washington to Los Angeles in 55 minutes, or purchase for $55 air passage from New York to Paris in one hour. Of course, there will be cynics who will ask: ‘Who wants to fly to Paris in an hour?’ The answer is: Most of the people who want to go to Paris.
“There is one predictable human trait. People will always go for the fastest transport. Not long after man got on a train, he took his freight out of the covered wagons and off the oxcarts forever. When people took up with automobiles, they soon put their produce, their pigs and their poultry on trucks.
“There is also some algebraic or arithmetic relation between the speed of travel and the number of people who travel. About 10 times as many people fly the Atlantic now in five hours as crossed when the trip took five days. No doubt 10 times more people will cross the ocean when they can do it in an hour.” (White House Release; Eaker, San Antonio Express, 7/8/65, 14)
• Sen. A. Willis Robertson (D-Va.) issued a statement opposing President Johnson’s plan for a supersonic commercial airliner:
“I attended the conference at the White House at which the secre-
tary of defense explained his plans for the development of a supersonic airplane that would be the fastest of any in the world, making mach 2.5 to 2.7, or about 1,800 miles per hour. The cost of developing this plane will be between 2 and 2.5 billion dollars, and when developed, the planes will probably cost 20 to 25 million each.
“. . . if we succeed in the development of this plane any airline that agrees to use them will have to be largely subsidized both for the purchase of the plane, which will have a limited life, and likewise for its operation. Consequently, I feel towards this project like I do about the shot to the moon—a fine advertising scheme, but not worth what it is going to cost the taxpayers.” (Text)

July 2: tiros x meteorological satellite was launched from Eastern Test range by a Thrust-Augmented Delta booster into a near-perfect sun-synchronous orbit from which it would photograph tropical storm breeding areas. Orbital parameters: apogee, 517 mi. (832 km.) ; perigee, 458 mi. (737 km.); period, 100.6 min.; inclination to the equator, 81.4°. The spacecraft at first was spinning too fast for picture-taking because of inability to command activation of an automatic slowdown device. A more intense ground signal sent during the second orbit activated the device, slowing the satellite’s spin rate from 138 rpm to about 13 rpm.
tiros x would photograph the hurricane-breeding area between 70° north and 30° south latitude, about 60 to 80 percent of the earth. Its two vidicon cameras would take more than 400 pictures daily, tiros ix in its “cartwheel” movement in orbit had been able to provide about 100 percent coverage of the earth daily.
The weather observation spacecraft was the 10th successful Tiros (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) to be launched by NASA in as many attempts, tiros x was funded by the Weather Bureau, while the previous nine were NASA research and development spacecraft. It was one of three satellites purchased by Weather Bureau in 1963 “to be used to assure continuity of satellite observations for operational purposes.” (nasa Release 65-229; NASA Release 65-197; ap, Wash.

•	PEGASUS II meteoroid detection satellite, orbited May 25 from Ken-
nedy Space Center, had reported “hits” on panels of all three thicknesses of aluminum target material, NASA reported. 14 penetrations had been recorded on the ,016-in.-thick detection panels; five on the .008-in. panels; and 34 on the .0015-in. panels.
In the first month report on pegasus n, Milton B. Ames, Jr., Director of NASA Space Vehicle Research and Technology, said that al-
though the number of penetrations varied slightly from earlier predictions, “the figures follow closely our statistical computations based on results from pegasus i and explorers xvi and xxm. Continued successful operation of pegasus ii will give us a good base for use by spacecraft designers in predicting the frequency and size of meteoroids which constitute a hazard to space flight.” Ames referred to a new capacitor fusing arrangement which would enable project engineers to disconnect a single malfunctioning capacitor while leaving other capacitors in the same group of panels working. If a malfunction serious enough to warrant disconnection of the entire panel group occurred, this could be done by ground command. 36 capacitors on PEGASUS II were working improperly during the first four weeks and had been disconnected by ground command to prevent a drain on the spacecraft’s power supply, (nasa Release 65-219; msfc Release 65-168)

July 6: ComSatCorp, rejecting petitions by seven communications carriers to reduce its authority, strongly supported Fee’s decision giving ComSatCorp “sole responsibility for the design, construction, and operation” of three ground stations to support the Corporation’s global satellite system for commercial communications.
Answering the charge that station ownership and operation should be assumed by the carriers on a competitive basis, ComSatCorp said the operational date of the global system would be needlessly delayed if ownership of stations were decided on a case-by-case basis.
To the complaint that the Fee decision gave ComSatCorp control of “terrestrial facilities” for traffic-processing between interface points and the stations themselves, ComSatCorp replied that it would “look
first to the carriers to provide” the facilities. Further, “should ComSatCorp determine, in any particular situation, to propose construction of its own communications links, the soundness of any such proposal would, of course, be subject to scrutiny by the Commission with full consideration of the views of all interested parties.”
Against the allegation that ComSatCorp-constructed terrestrial facilities would introduce costly “backhauls,” ComSatCorp said backhauling was “routine and unavoidable” throughout the communications industry. (ComSatCorp Release)

•	Rep. Burt L. Talcott (R-Calif.) inserted in the Congressional Record a
letter from E. J. Stecker, president of Holex, Inc., and an exhibitor at the Paris International Air Show (June 11-20) : “At Paris the Russians made us look like idiots and we cooperated so beautifully that it almost looked as though our public relations program was being directed by the Kremlin. . . .
“I walked through the aircraft park where the Russian and American exhibits were practically side by side. The Russian aircraft were exclusively commercial, the American almost 100 percent military. Think of the irony of the situation. . . .
“There was a long line waiting to enter the . . . space exhibit of the U.S.S.R. . . . inside was a full scale model of the Vostok space capsule and its rocket motor suspended from the ceiling, what appeared to be an operational Vostok in a glass case and Mr. Gagarin, Russia’s first man in space, who shook my hand . . . and gave me a Vostok lapel pin. This was easily the most popular exhibit at the show and I would estimate that 70 percent of the attendees had Vostok pins and were wearing them. . . .
“The Russians then flew in their great misshapen 750-passenger transport aircraft which really impressed the public. I examined it and as a pilot and engineer of many years standing, I feel it economically and militarily foolish, but the publicity value was tremendous.
“Then there was the announcement of the proposed U.S.S.R. SST transport which looks like a retouched Concorde. This also hit all of the front pages.
“In short, the Russians stole the show with an obsolete space capsule much inferior to our Mercury, an artist’s sketch of a supersonic transport and an overgrown, awkward monstrosity of an airplane. But they could do it because everything they did was aimed at and shown to the general public. . . .
“When White, McDivitt, and the Vice President finally arrived, it was a triumphant tour surrounded by Secret Service, press, public relations and photographers and the great mass of the unwashed public including the exhibitors were generally ignored and forgotten. . . .
“There were a few good points. James Webb, Administrator of the nasa, visited the U.S. exhibitors. He came unheralded and alone and had time to stop and talk for a few minutes without the aid of 50 photographers. In this, Jim was unique among the U.S. officials and should be commended. The usaf Thunderbirds and the U.S. Navy Blue Angels put on fantastic flying exhibitions on Thursday evening. But it occurred around 7:30 p.m. when most of the public had departed.
“The point is this: The Russians appealed to the people; we ignored the people and appealed to the press. As a result, the Russians only lost the front pages once and that was when we made them through the unfortunate crash of our 2-58.” (CR, 7/6/65, A3555-6)
July 6: President Johnson’s ordering 18 mo. of additional research on the supersonic airliner (Sst) program was assessed as a calculated risk by Robert J. Serling in Washington Post. The President was betting that the extra year and a half of development work would produce a plane so far superior to the British-French Concorde that the Concorde’s far earlier introduction would mean little in terms of sales, he said.
Serling pointed out that while advance orders for a purely paper Sst had outnumbered those of the under-construction Concorde by more than 2 to 1, the U.S. lead was built on the airlines’ belief that (1) U.S.’s plane would be far superior and (2) it would not come along too far behind the Concorde. However, present plans were for flight-testing the Concorde in 1968; the Soviet Union had announced it would have a supersonic airliner operational even before the Concorde. An inservice U.S. Sst was not likely before 1974 or 1975. (Serling, Wash. Post, 7/6/65, A8)
July 7: Some Presidential advisers who had once recoiled at the idea of a supersonic race were now wondering how long this country could delay without losing the bulk of the world market, wrote Evert Clark in the New York Times: “For a variety of reasons, most of the controversy over timetables has been kept out of the public forum, mainly because of Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, the chief Presidential advisor on the plane . . . Mr. McNamara swore the Government officials and private citizens on the advisory committee to secrecy at their first meeting, and that secrecy has been maintained.” (Clark, NYT, 7/7/65, 21)	'
• NASA’s mariner iv began feeling the gravitational pull of Mars a week before it was scheduled to take the first close-up pictures of the
planet. The tug was noticed at 5 p.m. edt in a slight change in speed as the 575-lb. spacecraft, 128,054,720 mi. from earth and 1,721,770 mi. from Mars, neared the end of its 228-day trip.
At noon, the speed relative to Mars was 9,879 mph. Tracking engineers said the speed, which had been dropping two mph every six hours, would lessen because of Mars’ gravity at a rate of one mph every six hours through July 10 when the speed would begin to increase. No further sensing of the planet’s presence in space was expected until July 14 when instruments aboard mariner iv might detect an increase in radiation, (ap, NYT, 7/8/65, 13; ap, Orl. Sent., 7/7/65)
July 7: Paul Haney, Public Affairs Officer at NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, said no extravehicular activity (Eva) was planned for the eight-day Gemini v mission scheduled for August 17 or for October’s two-day Gemini vi flight.
Astronauts Frank Borman (Maj., usaf) and James Lovell (Lcdr., usn), primary crew for Gemini vn, said they would attempt to communicate with a ground station via laser beam during their 14-day mission planned for early 1966. The laser—a beam of intense light— can transmit voices or other messages. Ground station at White Sands, N. Mex., aiming by radar, would fire the first laser signal at Gemini 7 as it passed overhead. The Gemini 7 crew would attempt to answer by pointing their capsule downward, aiming, and shooting a 10-lb., hand-held transmitter toward the ground. (Transcript; AP, Balt. Sun, 7/7/65; upi, Wash.

• The radar set that would guide Gemini astronauts on rendezvous missions in space, beginning with the August 19 Gemini v flight, was demonstrated by Westinghouse Corp.—working under an $18 million contract with	NASA—at	Friendship International Airport,
Baltimore. Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper (Maj., usaf) and Charles Conrad (Lcdr., usn) would carry a self-contained Rendezvous Evaluation Pod (Rep) into orbit on the back end of their spacecraft. An Agena rendezvous radar transponder and flashing beacons would be packaged in the Rep along with batteries and antenna. Midway through the second revolution, at 2 hrs. 25 min. after liftoff, command pilot Cooper would yaw the Gemini 5 spacecraft 90° to the right. Explosive charges would eject the Rep from its canister northward at 5 fps. Gemini 5 would then maneuver away from the Rep to attain a position six miles below and 14 mi. behind the Rep. Subsequent phase adjustment would place Gemini 5 in a co-elliptical orbit—that is, the spacecraft would be at constant altitude below the Rep but reducing the trailing distance, since the spacecraft in its lowest orbit would be traveling faster than the Rep.
Range and range-rate data would be displayed to the Gemini 5 crew by the rendezvous radar system. The radar system would continuously compute distance and angles from the spacecraft to the Pod, and calculate the maneuvers necessary to effect rendezvous.
At five hours and 36 min. after liftoff, if the mission went as planned, Gemini 5 should be closing in on the Rep just north of the Carnarvon, Australia, tracking station. Gemini 5 would not physically dock with Rep; the experiment would simply provide training for
Gemini vi and other rendezvous missions and evaluate the rendezvous radar hardware to be used on the Agena target vehicle in later missions. (Clark, NYT, 7/8/65, 12; Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 1/8/65; Msc Rounduy, 7/23/65, 1, 2)

•	M. I. Kiselev and E. B. Galitskaya had worked out a method of control-
ling spaceships by means of solar pressure. They proposed a system of reflecting black and white blades which would work like a propeller or a “solar rotary mill.” By regulating the inclination of the blades, one could obtain a torsional moment and change its direction and deceleration. Under conditions of weightlessness, the large size of the blades needed to provide the required torsional moment did not present any difficulties, and the blades would eliminate the need for additional energy sources for maneuvering in space.

•	Photos of the rim of the terrestrial globe and of the twilight aur-
eole taken by VOSTOK vi revealed two turbid layers in the stratosphere, Prof. Georgiy Rozenberg was reported in National Zeitung as saying at a space physics conference. The two layers contained relatively dense water-and-ice-covered particles at heights of 11,500 and 19,500 m. (37,950 and 64,350 ft.). Prof. Rozenberg assumed that sulphuric oxide emitted by volcanoes played an important role in the formation of the layers. He concluded that the colored luminescense following major volcanic outbreaks was related to this phenomenon. (National Zeitung, 7/7/65, 6)
•	Consensus of W. German observers at the International Air Show (June
11-20), as reported in Der Spiegel, was that the Soviet aircraft were obvious copies of Western models, but with inferior workmanship (often hand-made details) and instrumentation: the Ilyushin-62 was a poor copy of the British VC-10; the Tupolev-134 was a hybird of the French Caravelle and British bac 111; the Antonov—24B was obviously copied from the Dutch “Friendship” and the British “Handley Page Herald”; the navigational instrument used on the Tu-134 was the American World War II Eyeball Mark One; the design model of the
Tu-144 so resembled the Concorde that it was humorously referred to as the Concordovich. (Heumann, Der Spiegel, 7/7/65, 86—87)
July 8: Transfer of control of syncom ii and SYNCOM ill communications satellites from NASA to DOD was completed. Under direction of the Defense Communications Agency, the three telemetry and command stations for maintaining precise control and positioning of the satellites would be operated by usaf at locations in the Seychelles Islands, Hawaii, and Guam.

•	MSFC Director Dr. Wernher von Braun, speaking before the Inter-
national Christian Leadership World Conference in Seattle, said the two dominant forces shaping the course of human events in our revolutionary age were science and religion. And, Dr. von Braun said, “it is depressing to witness a growing misconception that these two powerful forces are not compatible.” On the contrary: science was trying to harness the forces of nature around man, while through religion man sought to control the forces of nature within.
Dr. von Braun said science and scientists had been blamed for the desperate dilemma today, because science had utterly failed to provide a practical answer on how to handle the powerful forces it had unleashed. He said the blame for the wrongful use of force could not be pinned on science:	“Science, all by itself, has no moral
dimension. The same drug that heals when taken in moderation will kill when taken in excess. Only when a society accepts and applies a scientific advance do we add a moral dimension to it.” (Marshall Star, 7/14/65, 2)

Wind tunnel experiments there had proven that the closer a viewer is to turbulent air, the more it distorts an image: the image wavers in brightness, changes position, and shifts in and out of focus. All these effects diminish contrast—an essential factor in identifying objects in aerial reconnaissance. The effects are reduced and seeing improves as the viewer moves away from the turbulence.

July 11: New York Times editorial on July 14 mariner iv flyby of Mars said: “On Wednesday, if all goes well, one of the epoch-making experiments in the history of science will take place as mariner iv comes within 6,000 miles of Mars and takes pictures for transmission back to earth. Not since Galileo first trained his telescope on the moon has there been such a prospect for a quantum leap in man’s knowledge of a nearby world.
“Whatever the results of the picture-taking experiment, the accomplishments of mariner iv are already historic. Launched last Nov. 28, it has traversed a preassigned course for more than seven months. During this time it has flown roughly 350,000,000 mi. while communicating back to earth new scientific data as well as a steady flow of information on its flight and its internal condition. This performance far exceeds all similar earlier feats.
“For comparison we may note that mariner ii—justly famed for its flight past Venus in 1962—needed to fly only three and a half months and 180 million miles to reach its objective. And while mariner II sets a record signalling to earth from a distance of 53.9 million miles away, mariner iv has recently been transmitting from the neighborhood of Mars, now over 130,000,000 miles distant from this planet.” (NYT, 7/11/65, E10)

dna and rna, nucleic acids, form the core of and are the “prime movers” of all living cells in plants, animals, and man. The five dna—rna building blocks, known as nucleotides, are made up of a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and a phosphate. Their synthesis under
laboratory conditions could be a major advance toward explaining the origin of life on earth; it could have retraced a critical phase in the chemical evolution of organic material which had to occur before the appearance of life itself.
Synthesis of nucleotides had been done before, but always by long, complex laboratory procedures, (nasa Release 65-221; arc Release 65-17; Marshall Star, 7/14/65, 9)

• Senate defeated by 61-to-16 the proposed Proxmire amendment to
make an across-the-board reduction of 5% in the NASA appropriations bill. This left the Senate bill, still to receive its final vote, at $5.19 billion. The House had passed a $5.16 billion appropriation.
Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) had contended that the manned lunar landing program constituted an “excessive waste.” Sen. Joseph S. Clark (D-Pa.) had felt the problem was not one of waste or inefficiency but felt that more of the nation’s resources should be put into education, housing, pollution abatement, and other urban problems. Sen. Wayne Morse (D-Ore.) had supported the reduction but had proposed that the cut be 25 c/ or 50%. “The American people have been thoroughly taken in by a TV spectacular,” he said and charged that the space program “is all for the purpose of gratifying our national ego.” Senator Morse had indicated that no other single agency conducted programs “with such vague objectives with such little return to the national Government.”
Proxmire had charged that NASA was the prime example of an agency whose expenditures Congress had difficulty in controlling, that certain project costs within the NASA program could be reduced, and that NASA used too great a proportion of our monetary, material, and manpower resources.
The 16 Senators voting for the Proxmire amendment were Boggs, Clark, Cooper, Douglas, Fullbright, Gruening, Kennedy (N.Y.), McGovern Miller, Morse, Morton, Mundt, Nelson, Proxmire, Williams (N.J.), and Williams (Del.). {CR, 7/12/65, 15927-40)

July 13: NASA invited scientists to propose, by August 15, the various experiments to be included in a continuing Voyager program of exploration of the planets. The Mars Voyager program would begin with a test flight in 1969 followed by an orbiter-lander flight in 1971 with other flights following in 1973, 1975, and beyond. The program would also include missions now under consideration for flights to Venus and other planets. The experiments to be included in the 1971 mission of the landing capsule would be subject to strict sterilization requirements. In following programs, there would be considerable latitude in the choice of experiments, (nasa Release 65-230)

•	JPL Director Dr. William Pickering held up some fuzzy photographs of
patches of the moon during a JPL press conference and said this was the best quality to be expected from the mariner iv television
system. The pictures should be better than any ever obtained from earth if the system operated as planned, he said. Each of the mariner iv pictures would consist of 200 rows of 200 dots. Each dot would be sent as a number ranging from 0 to 63, designating the darkness of the dot. Reconstruction of the picture would be done by a computer at JPL. Because the first views would scan the planet obliquely, it might not be until the third image that one was received showing any obvious surface features. This, according to Dr. Pickering, might mean that no pictures would be displayed publicly until July 16. (Sullivan, NYT, 7/15/65, 1)

July 14: mariner tv approached within 5.500 mi. of Mars and took the first close-up pictures in history of that planet.
At 10:28 a.m. edt, a signal from the tracking station at Johannesburg, South Africa, had commanded mariner iv to turn on the en-
counter equipment. Obeying the command 12 min. later—the time it took the signal to reach the spacecraft across 134,000,000 mi.— mariner iv’s scan platform with TV cameras and two Mars sensors began searching for the planet; the tape recorder began a 10-hr. warmup.
By 1:10 p.m., the spacecraft’s sensors had found the proper angle from which to photograph Mars. On orders from JPL, the Johannesburg tracking station ordered the camera and its light sensor to stop the scan at 7/10 of a degree of the optimum aiming point.
Throughout the day, the spacecraft continued transmitting scientific and engineering information via the telemetry system.
At 7:50 p.m., the Mars probe made its first “sighting” contact with the planet. The telemetry system then shifted and began sending only information from the scientific experiments.
At 8:20 p.m. edt, the first light from Mars struck the light sensor aligned with the camera and the 25-min. picture-taking sequence began. 21 frames were exposed and recorded on magnetic tape to be telemetered to earth over a 10-day period. Transmission of each picture would require 8 hrs. 25 min.
Near the end of the fly-by, signals received at Goldstone tracking station had indicated a malfunction in the tape system. Telemetry received after the pass, however, showed no indication that trouble had occurred.
At 10:12, mariner iv flew behind Mars, remained obscured for 53 min., and re-emerged beyond the planet, its transmitter beaming radio signals through the Martian atmosphere. From this occultation experiment, scientists might be able to gauge the depth, thickness, and component gases of Mars’ atmosphere by measuring how much these signals were bent and their speeds changed.
Dr. William H. Pickering, jpl Director, told a news conference that signals indicated all instruments on the spacecraft had performed properly during the flyby, (nasa Release 65-227; Sullivan, NYT, 7/15/65; Hoffman, N.Y.

•	Commenting on the U.S. need for a Manned Orbiting Laboratory (Mol),
Lt. Gen. Ira C. Eaker (usaf, Ret.) said in the San Antonio Express: “The nearly simultaneous launch of NASA’s Gemini and Air Force’s Titan ill—c caused some commentators to suggest that there is competition and rivalry in the space effort. Investigation convinces me that there is complete collaboration and accord between NASA and the military in the space program.
“There is now little reason to doubt that NASA will succeed with Apollo, the Moon mission. Our continued leadership in the exploration of the peaceful uses of space seems assured.
“It is now time to survey where we stand in the military implications and dangers from space. . . .
“The first step in a needed military space program, which the Air Force earnestly and urgently proposes, is a manned orbiting laboratory (mol). It is visualized as an experimental space station in low orbit to determine what man can profitably do in space.
“The anti-MOL advocates have suggested that the fall-out from the NASA space program will provide all the building blocks to produce military space vehicles quickly when the need is more clearly evident. Fall-out from the automobile industry did not provide the Patton tank. It was necessary to cut and try, build and test many experimental tanks over a period of 25 years.
“Building blocks from civil air transports did not produce the b-52 bomber. We had to build and test 51 earlier bomber models. Effective space weapons will never come solely from the fall-out from the NASA program.
“mol is said to be held up until the Air Force can precisely define and defend a military mission which MOL can be certain to accomplish. To require anyone to visualize and indicate definitely and in detail now, all that man may ultimately do in space, would be like having asked the Wright brothers in 1910 to lay down the specifications for a supersonic transport.” (Eaker, San Antonio Express, 7/14/65, 18)
July 15: The first close-up picture of Mars transmitted by NASA’s mariner IV in an eight-hour broadcast over a distance of 134 million mi. clearly showed the edge of the planet. Transmitted to earth as a series of 5 million radio signals representing zeroes and ones, the picture was received at the Madrid and Johannesburg tracking stations and relayed to jpl. A jpl computer reconstructed the digits to produce images consisting of a series of dots of varying darkness. With transmission at 8.3 dots a second, 8/4 hrs. were required to receive the photograph.
The photo sequence began when the bright edge, or limb, of Mars was seen by a light sensor which triggered MARINER iv’s magnetic tape recorder. Initial information came from an experimental device called a “cluge” which built up a rough pattern of the photo on a monitor screen as it was relayed from the tracking stations to jpl. Taken at a low angle with an oblique view, the first photograph did not show the detail expected in later photographs.
At a news conference at jpl, Dr. J. A. Van Allen, Univ. of Iowa, said that during its Mars flyby, mariner iv had discovered with a variety of detectors that Mars had little or no magnetic field and, therefore, no radiation belts. This would indicate that the planet lacks a liquid core and thus differs basically from earth. Lack of a metallic core, liquid or solid, would be evidence that the planet never went through the churning internal processes that gave the earth its layered structure. Mars would not have continents formed of lightweight rocks and ocean basins underlain with basaltic rock as found on earth.
W. M. Alexander, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, explained that there was no evidence of a belt or unusual concentration of cosmic dust around the planet, nor, pointed out Dr. H. S. Bridge, mit, was there any evidence of a shock wave caused by solar wind flowing across the planet. The solar wind was the steady outflow of thin, hot, high-velocity gas from the sun.
Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of jpl, when questioned by newsmen on the possibility of higher life existing on Mars, pointed out that the absence of a magnetic field indicated the planet’s atmosphere was hit with all types of radiation and the existence of life would depend on how deep the atmosphere was and the extent of radiation that reached the surface. Asked if he were discouraged about the possibility of finding life on the planet, Dr. Pickering replied: “No, I have always felt we will find some sort of life on Mars.”
Dr. Pickering pointed out that one explanation for the reddish hue of Mars might be the presence of limonite, an iron oxide. This would suggest that iron was uniformly spread through the planet rather than being largely concentrated in the core, as on earth. (Transcript; Sullivan, NYT, 1/16/65, 1, 10; Miles, Wash.

• Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center, nasa, said in an address at the First World Exhibition of Transport and Communications in Munich: “It is my personal opinion, shared by some colleagues, that space flight will logically follow the pattern of historical development which has characterized the transportation industry. That is, the exploitation of the system is an outgrowth of its invention.
“This pattern is vividly demonstrated by the popular American legend that Henry Ford invented the automobile, when in fact the automobile is not really an American invention at all. For one thing, it was not invented by any one man, but by a host of inventors—most of them Europeans.
“However, Henry Ford did initiate the exploitation of this invention as a means of transportation for almost every family in America. Ford was a man of great inventive genius who strove to mass produce a highly reliable automobile at low unit cost. So Ford took advantage of this once-novel invention, the automobile, by developing to a high degree the arts of mass production with interchangeable parts, line assembly, and finally conveyor assembly; and thus he ushered in a new age of public transportation.
“The automobile also serves as an excellent example that even the farsighted and visionary inventor often cannot visualize the ultimate utilization of his invention by the public. For the modern automobile is a combination of many inventions—the wheel, the pneumatic tire which in turn depended upon the discovery of vulcanized rubber, the internal combustion engine and gasoline—to name a few. To illustrate an extreme case, I seriously doubt if the inventor of the wheel could visualize its use in such a supernatural machine as the automobile! In the more recent past, Benjamin Silliman, Jr., a brilliant American petrochemist of the late-nineteenth century, considered gasoline a useless and dangerous byproduct of his process for refining lamp kerosene.
“The thing to remember is that the automotive industry did not spring from public demand. It came about because there were inventors who braved ridicule and worse and because others were quick to seize upon their creations. There was no expressed requirement for the airplane, nor for the trans-Atlantic air travel opened up by Charles Lindbergh. The novel products of inventive minds become the everyday products of our society. The full impact of these products is unpredictable at the time of their invention.
“The American scientist, Robert Goddard, who created the first liquid-fueled rockets in the United States, remarked that ‘Every vision is a joke until the first man accomplishes it.’
“The men who dreamed up and worked out methods of efficient transportation unwittingly opened up broad new vistas, and touched off the growth of tremendous production and service industries. They showed the way to expedite the movement of people and goods, and they also accelerated the exchange of ideas and customs and thus promoted understanding and cooperation.
“Robert Goddard in America, like Hermann Oberth in Europe, were scorned and laughed at in their time. But while we are meeting here, men are preparing more journeys into the limitless areas beyond Earth’s atmosphere, working with much the same theories and techniques proposed by Oberth and Goddard.” (Text)
July 15: “One absolute certainty is that if the atomic bomb had not gone off at Alamogordo 20 years ago tomorrow, the spacecraft Mariner 4 would not have flown past Mars yesterday,” wrote William Hines in the Washington Evening Star. He continued: “Space and the atom are more closely interrelated than most people realize. We are in a space race today because—and only because—big rockets were developed by the East and West starting about 15 years ago. . . . Solely to carry atomic (and later hydrogen) warheads. There would have been no space race without big rockets because the staggering development costs for space applications alone could never have been justified.
“The ‘aerospace business’ of the non-atomic ’60’s, then, would have been ‘airplane business’ pure and simple—and airplanes would be much different than they are today. There would be no ‘atomic energy industry,’ of course—and these two differences would have a measurable economic impact. Probably a million jobs nationwide depend either directly or indirectly on space and the atom.
“Equally obviously, two vast bureaucracies dedicated to ‘running’ space and the atom would not exist. The Atomic Energy Commission has about 7,300 employes and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration about 33,000. Together they ‘own’ something like $18 billion worth of property.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 7/15/65)

July 17: Two more MARINER IV close-up shots of Mars were released by NASA. The first three photographs showed an almost unbroken strip of terrain more than 600 mi. long. They revealed features down to two miles in length, including several crater-like objects, a kidneyshaped depression 20-30 mi. in width, and ridges and depressions similar to those on the moon. None of them showed straight-line features that might have been taken by earth-based observers to be canals. Except for the suggestion of an arid, wind-swept, desert-like terrain, the pictures did not bear directly on the question of life on the planet.
During a press conference held at JPL, Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of jpl, said that mariner iv had been a “magnificent success.” The computer which had reconstructed the numbers transmitted by mariner iv into photographs had proved capable of cleaning up and intensifying the image to a remarkable degree. The pic tures were of a high quality, and, in addition, the lighting conditions were expected to improve the detail in later photographs. Comparison of overlapping areas—one picture in a pair exposed through a green filter and one through a red filter—might reveal some things about color on Mars that would not otherwise be obtainable.

•	“The President has taken the moderate and, in this case, wise course in
deciding to speed up the development of an American supersonic commercial airliner with an additional $140 million in research over the next IV2 years,” said a Washington Post editorial. It continued: “He could have called a halt to the program and abdicated America’s avia-
tion industry leadership to France and Britain, who already are developing their Concorde, or to the Soviets with their TU-144. Or he could have followed the recommendation of some of his advisers and spent even greater sums of money to build two competing types of planes which both might end up as impractical white elephants.
“. . . the President’s moderate speed-up decision certainly is justified on scientific grounds, for research invariably turns up new ideas for progress. And it is justified on political grounds as well, for this country must maintain its pioneering leadership in all forms of transportation.” {Wash. Post, 7/17/65)
July 17: Transmissions from MARINER iv were received by the nine-month-old Tidbinbilla tracking station at Canberra, Australia—one of three primary stations in the worldwide network of space tracking stations built for the Mars probe. Since February, a movable reflector antenna had maintained daily contact with MARINER iv, picking up signals from Goldstone, Calif., station in the morning and relaying them to the Johannesburg station nine hours later. As the signals were received from mariner IV, they were retransmitted over the Pacific cable teletype to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
After completion of mariner iv mission, Tidbinbilla would be used to track Surveyor vehicles. (NYT, 7/18/65)

•	A new computer technique had been designed by NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center to make repeated rapid checks of effects of a man-made radiation belt of high-energy “Starfish” electrons formed from a U.S. hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific Ocean in 1962, and subsequent tests conducted for Project Fish Bowl, a high-altitude weapon test. Starfish electrons were estimated to have a possible life of up to 20
yrs., during which time electrons in the belt would slowly decay to the energy level of ordinary electrons. E. G. Stassinopoulos, designer of the program, warned that increased solar activity in years ahead would greatly affect the lifetimes of the Starfish electrons, making the computer relatively useless after 1966.

July 18: MARINER iv’s experimental solar-vane aiming system was expected to operate successfully for three and one half years in space, wrote Walter Sullivan in the New York Times. The vanes should keep the spacecraft aimed at the sun whose light shining on the vehicle’s four-wing solar panels would generate electric power. Acting on pressure of sunlight and the high-velocity solar wind, the vanes would correct tendencies to drift off course.
The basic attitude control system of mariner iv consisted of 12 jets, at the tips of the solar panels, which squirted cold compressed nitrogen. The purpose of the solar vanes was to conserve the nitrogen and thereby prolong the vehicle’s serviceable lifetime. (Sullivan, NYT, 7/19/65,31)

Mars taken by mariner iv: “There is something absolutely staggering about the idea of a piece of machinery from this country’s workshops finding its way to Mars and then pausing on schedule to make picture signals which bounce back here 12 minutes later.
“Such a feat cheers up the most confirmed pessimist. After all, if man has the genius to reach back and forth into the universe, surely he will discover a way for peoples, nations and ideologies to live and survive together back here on this insignificant little planet.” (Wash. Post, 7/18/65)
“Though all its findings are not yet in, it is already clear that Mariner 4’s historic journey to Mars is the most successful and most important experiment man has yet conducted in space, as well as one of the most brilliant engineering and scientific achievements of all time.
“The triumph scored by mariner 4 in this first successful attempt at the exploration of Mars emphasizes a point suggested by the earlier achievements of instrumented probes, notably the Ranger photographic voyages to the moon. That point is that a great deal of scientific information about earth’s nearest neighbors in the solar system can be obtained relatively cheaply and without risk to human life by utilizing fully the potentialities of existing instruments. Cameras and other research devices can undoubtedly be placed in orbit about or landed softly on the surfaces of the moon and nearby planets. And intensive exploitation of the capabilities of unmanned rockets can make far safer the ultimate dispatch of man into far distant space.” (NYT, 7/16/65)
•	“Soviet propaganda needs in the wake of Mariner 4’s flight to Mars
appear to have been influential in determining the timing of the latest Soviet space shots,” wrote Harry Schwartz in the New York Times. He continued: “Moscow’s decision to send up last Friday two rockets—one putting five small satellites into orbit and the second orbiting the heaviest man-made object yet put into space—seems to Western observers to be a transparent Soviet effort to counteract the
propaganda defeat Moscow suffered as a result of Mariner 4’s historic voyage. That defeat was all the greater because of the failure of the Soviet Mars probe, Zond, sent on the same journey at roughly the same time Mariner 4 was launched.” (Schwartz, NYT, 7/18/65)
July 18: Observers in Moscow believed that the Soviet Union would shortly launch a gigantic spacecraft with as many as four to six people aboard, said an article in Poland’s Trybura Ludu. The spacecraft would most likely be commanded by one of the experienced cosmonauts and would have a weight of over 12 tons. It would be placed in orbit by the booster which launched PROTON I. The latter, according to the correspondent, probably used solid fuel.

Cooper explained that during the flight the astronauts would try to sight a USN Polaris missile to be launched from the East Coast and an unidentified missile to be launched from the West Coast. It was not disclosed at what point during the mission either of the launches would occur. In addition, Cooper said he and Conrad would attempt to sight rocket engines ignited on a rocket sled at Holloman afb, N. Mex.
Also on the program would be an attempt to rendezvous with a Rendezvous Evaluation Pod (Rep) which would be ejected from the spacecraft and would drift to a distance of about 60 mi. from the spacecraft. The radar equipment onboard would then assist in performing maneuvers to achieve rendezvous with the Pod, although actual contact was not planned. Cooper said that backup system for reentry would not be used again because the thrust fuel would be used in the rendezvous experiment. No extravehicular activity would be performed during this mission.
The astronauts announced they would attempt to communicate with fellow astronaut Scott Carpenter (Cdr., usn) participating in the USN Sealab ii experiment beneath the Pacific. Flight plans called for a landing in the West Atlantic.

•	Dr. Homer E. Newell, nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science
and Applications, spoke at the dedication ceremonies for Martin Co.’s new Research Institute for Advanced Studies in Relay, Md., about some of the progress that had been made in space science: “Because of the space program, geophysics is experiencing a tremendous broadening of its horizons. . . . Moreover, geophysics is being carried forward to new domains, as instruments reach the moon and the planets, giving to the discipline a perspective it could never achieve as long as geophysics was confined to a single body of the solar system.
“Similarly, the space program is giving a new dimension to astronomy. The ability to observe above the filtering distorting atmosphere in wavelengths not hitherto observable promises exciting new discoveries. . . .
“The field of physics finds in the regions of outer space a laboratory of challenging opportunity. In interplanetary space, matter and fields exist under conditions unobtainable in the laboratory on the ground. . . .
“It is, indeed, interesting to observe that one of the impacts of space efforts on physics, geophysics, and astronomy has been to draw the three disciplines together more closely than they have been drawn together in the past. In the investigation of sun-earth relationships, a most complex and challenging area of investigation, all three of these disciplines find themselves in partnership on problems of common interest. . . .
“The impact of the space program on bioscience is still developing ... of particular importance is the area of exobiology. . . .
“The satellite, space probe, and manned spacecraft give the scientist a new approach to the solution of many important problems. They serve to strengthen his hand—if used effectively. . . .” (Text)

July 25: “Should the mol blueprint as envisioned by the Air Force’s Systems Command be approved by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, the Navy conceivably could be the first to use this earth-orbiting station as a new technique for charting ship movements on all the oceans of the world,” wrote Frank Macomber in the San Diego Union. Macomber envisioned “two Navy astronauts . . . spinning around the earth as early as 1968 in a 10-foot diameter, 25-foot long orbital laboratory—about the size of a small house trailer filled with electronic detection gear . . .” (Macomber, CNS, San Diego Union, 7/25/65, 13)

•	A Gemini circumlunar flight had not been approved but the idea was
receiving serious study, Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, Deputy Manager of
the Gemini Project Office at nasa Manned Spacecraft Center, told reporters. The Gemini capsule could circle the far side of the moon—.
240,000	mi. from earth—and then return to its home planet, a round trip of about six days.
Kleinknecht said if the proposal were accepted, a Titan m-C rocket equipped with two upper stages called “transtages” would place one of the transtages in orbit. A Titan II would send the Gemini craft after the transtage and the two would be docked in orbit. Gemini then would use the transtage propulsion system and its maneuverability for the lunar voyage.
The feasibility was being studied by nasa; the Martin Co., systems manager for Titan Iir-c; and Aerojet-General, which builds the transtage. “We are always studying possible future missions for Gemini,” Kleinknecht added.

July 26-29: Second annual meeting of the AIAA was held in San Francisco. Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, opened the meeting with a signal from MARINER IV soaring through space 144 million mi. from earth. Received at the Johannesburg tracking station, the signal was relayed to San Francisco from JPL in Pasadena. Speeches at AIAA:
President of Lockheed Aircraft Corp., Daniel J. Haughton, speaking on “Your Role in the New Environment,” said: “American aircraft products have dominated world markets for decades. Today at least 90 percent of the airline jets flown in the free world are built in the United States. Aircraft exports, both military and civilian, are $1.2 billion a year. Imports, on the other hand, are almost negligible— $90 million last year.
“But now something new has been added—and that is more thrust toward cooperative programs. . . .
“Cooperative programs are increasing. Only last May Secretary of Defense McNamara proposed a common market for military hardware. If successful, it will help integrate the total NATO market, including the U.S., even more closely, and will also permit foreign firms to sell selectively in the American defense market.
“The total effect of these developments means, for U.S. manufacturers, more competition, more cooperative programs, and a more flexible approach . . . but I do not believe this means we must abdicate our technological leadership. I think, on the contrary, that we must strengthen it. One of my colleagues suggests we should add a new item to our national goals—the goal of overwhelming technical strength. . . .” (Text)
Brig. Gen. Edmund F. O’Connor (usaf), Director of the nasa Marshall Space Flight Center’s Industrial Operations, told the aiaa meeting: “The progress of the Saturn ib has been excellent. We are on
schedule to begin flight tests next year, to be followed by manned flights in 1967.

July 26: usaf’s Titan iii-c rocket could match the Soviet Union’s most powerful booster pound for pound in launching heavy-weight satellites into orbit, according to William G. Purdy, General Manager, Launch Vehicles, Martin Co. “Engineering analysis of Titan III—c’s performance on its maiden flight of June [18] shows that a payload of nearly
27.000	pounds could have been orbited. In the past, Titan in—c’s maximum payload has been computed at 25,000 lbs.” Mr. Purdy said that the Soviet Union’s best was the 26,840-lb. proton i satellite launched July 16 by powerful new rocket. (Martin Co. Release)
NASA Science Advisory Committee was considering a proposal by radio astronomers to create a lO-mi.-dia. antenna array to permit a “look” into the past with radio energy, disclosed Bernard M. Oliver, Vice President of a Palo Alto electronics firm. He estimated that
1.000	antennas, each perhaps 10-ft.-dia., spread out over the area of a 10-mi. circle, would provide the resolution of signal intake necessary for the kind of radio observation he was suggesting. Intake of all the antennas would be focused at a single laboratory. There the radio energy would be converted to sound energy and then into light to provide photographic images equivalent to optical images now taken of the moon. Oliver said: “We quite strongly believe that such an exploration tool can provide the maximum amount of information relating to the origins of the universe, to the life cycle, and to the destiny of the universe, and, in a sense, to the destiny of the human race as a whole.” (Chic. Trib., 7/28/65)
Missions to Jupiter could be conducted by 1969, suggested Eugene Lally, Space-General Corp. engineer, in a paper presented to the AIAA outlining a program of six missions to the planet Jupiter, beginning with a fly-by in 1969 and culminating with a Jovian orbit in the mid-1980’s. A Jupiter mission would take about two years. Lally postulated that payload weights ranging from a 650-lb. payload to a 12,400-lb. orbiter payload could be easily handled by boosters ranging from Atlas-Centaur with an added kick stage, through the Saturn V which would be used to place a man on the moon. Lally speculated that an instrumented probe would be able to obtain information on the constitution of the core and surface layers, the atmosphere, nature of the largest of the planet’s spots, topography, constitution of meteoroids in its vicinity and the presence of small satellites not yet discovered with telescopes. Lally’s probe would contain experiments to measure the atmosphere, magnetic fields, and gravitational fields; to conduct infrared and microwave examinations of the surface; and to provide pictures similar to those taken of Mars by mariner iv.

An Electro-Optical Systems (eos) bombardment ion engine had successfully operated for more than 2,610 hrs. in vacuum chamber conditions and, as a result of that extended run, “lifetimes in excess of
10.000 hours can now be calculated for the tiny engine under conditions of space flight,” Gordon Sohl, Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., told the aiaa meeting in San Francisco. Fueled with cesium, the EOS en-
gine was less than two feet long and weighed 10 lbs. fully loaded with a five-pound fuel supply. It provided a power-to-thrust ratio of 182 kw. per pound. Financed by NASA Lewis Research Center, the EOS research program recently received a follow-on funding from LRC to determine “if the ion engine with 100 pounds of cesium fuel is equivalent in thrust to a conventional chemical rocket carrying a ton of propellant.” (eos Release)
Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, nasa Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, presented the third annual Theodore von Karman lecture. Dr. Bisplinghoff discussed advances in air transport, such as V/Stol aircraft and the hypersonic transport. He pointed out that within 20 yrs. an estimated 130 million persons (about 50% of the U.S. population) would be living in three main metropolitan areas and that there would be an increasing demand for “air buses.” Dr. Bisplinghoff suggested that the hydrogen-fueled hypersonic transport could be used as a cheap transport, or as an earth-to-orbit aircraft. He said that the hypersonic transport would carry passengers halfway around the earth nonstop at speeds up to 8,006 mph, but there was one problem area: . . . “Where the airplane threatens to overpower the pilot with characteristics which make the airplane unflyable by human systems.” Dr. Bisplinghoff called for increased research for operational experience with the scram jet (supersonic combustion ramjet) engine as a prelude to developing the hypersonic transports.
In a press conference preceding his lecture, Dr. Bisplinghoff predicted “another revolution” for personal aircraft in the form of highly simplified controls similar to those in automobiles. He also urged quick Government action to begin the acquisition of a follow-on hypersonic research aircraft to succeed the X-15 and run the flight profile out to mach 10 to 12.

nasa Electronics Research Center Director Dr. Winston E. Kock discussed erc in address. During fy 1965, he said, erc “awarded 33 contracts totaling almost $2 million. The organizations to whom these contracts were awarded are spread widely throughout the country. . . .
“The average value of the 33 contracts was $59,000, the largest being $285,000. These contracts were almost all in fairly basic research fields, ranging from integrated circuits and thin film space-charge limited triodes, through research in millimeter and submillimeter waves, optical wave-guides and optical components, to space-borne memory organizations, laser gyros and fluid storage and control devices. . . .”
He discussed erc personnel: “We have grown from a group of 65 at our inception last year [Sept. 1] to a total of 244. As we are still in the formative stages, our scientific and engineering personnel now total only 92 out of the 244, but when we have reached our full strength of 2100, we expect that our staff will be about equally divided between scientific and engineering, technical support and administrative. . . .” (Text)
Thomas Bilhorn, Manager, Mechanics Section, Scientific Balloon Facility at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (ncar), re-
vealed that facilities for launching balloons capable of carrying
16,000-lb. payloads were expected to be completed by next summer at ncar’s Scientific Balloon Flight Facility in Texas. The device under construction, called an inflation shelter, would have a ceiling height of 140 ft. and interior diameter of 120 ft. It would reduce handling problems during inflation and would give the capability of periods of hold, recall, and post-inflation inspection and repair. (Text)
“There is nothing hostile or aggressive in the military space program we foresee. It is entirely within the context of a national program expressly devoted to peaceful purposes,” said Dr. Albert C. Hall, Deputy Director (Space) of Defense Research and Engineering. He continued: “It is likely that military interest will remain focused primarily on near-earth missions, out to synchronous orbit, certainly through 1975. We expect to continue our very large and vigorous unmanned military space program which is performing very important functions. The need for these programs will not diminish since they are by far the most efficient and cheapest way of performing specified tasks. With a steadily increasing experience and know-how in manned space flight, we may expect that spacecraft will acquire characteristics permitting rendezvous, station-keeping, docking, and transfer of man and material. We will likely acquire the means of sustaining military men in space for the periods of time we require. Booster capacities are not likely to limit the applications, but the booster and payload costs will continue to do so.” (Text)
In aiaa session on the “History of Rocket Research Airplanes,” John Stack, former naca-nasa designer, pointed out how little was known about transonic and supersonic flight in 1943, when X-l was conceived. Walter C. Williams, Dr. Raymond Bisplinghoff, and Walter T. Bonney, among other speakers, also stressed the key role of engineer test pilots in the success of the X-l, d-558, x-2, and X-15 programs. Session was chaired by Robert Perry of rand Corporation, who traced the history of rocket-powered aircraft, (eph; rand P-3154)
DeMarquis D. Wyatt, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Programing, told the meeting: “Any discussion of the NASA space program for the next 10 years must be given and received with a grain of salt. Reconstruct in your minds the situation 10 years ago and evaluate the validity of any discussion at that time of the NACA program for the period 1955-1965. Such a discussion would not have even mentioned space in any serious fashion. A paper delivered in 1960 that attempted to outline the NASA program for 1960-1970 would have widely missed the mark in the prediction of today’s realities. One can, therefore, conclude that one of the major management problems of the national space program is the lack of an adequate crystal ball for forecasting the future.
“In the 6% years of its existence NASA has carried out a vigorous program of space activities designed to yield:
“(a) a description and scientific understanding of the space environment; (b) the development of a broadly based national capability and capacity for manned and unmanned operations in space, and (c) the development of practical uses of space.
“Decisions will have to be made with an appreciation of, and indeed the shaping of, our whole national attitude toward space in relation to our other national requirements and interests. Far too many future studies within and without the government are predicated on the assumption that the national investment in space research and technology will at least grow at the rate of the Gross National Product. This has not been true for the past several years and does not afford a necessarily sound planning assumption for the future. Our total federal budget has leveled off in spite of the great increase in the national product in recent years. If this trend holds, then marked increases in space expenditures can only come about through decreases in other federal spending. Such an assumption would indeed be a slender reed upon which to prognosticate the future.” (Text)
Dr. Vincent P. Rock, Director of George Washington Univ.’s Program of Policy Studies in Science and Technology, said: “People are shaped by their environment. Technology is creating a new environment. In these circumstances power flows to those with access to technology—all technology, not simply military weapons. The exercise of power brings with it responsibility. The ultimate responsibility of those who exercise technological power is the achievement of a hospitable environment for mankind.” “Text)

•	Dr. George E. Mueller, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned
Space Flight, speaking at the Annual Convention of the American Trial Lawyers Association in Miami Beach, said: “I would like first to comment on what appears to be a general misconception about the overall purposes of the Apollo program. Many people seem to believe that a landing on the moon, ahead of the Soviets, is the paramount objective. This is not so. The principal goal is to make the United States first in space by the end of this decade, and to make this pre-eminence unmistakably clear to the world.
“Why ... is it so vital that the United States be pre-eminent in space? There are many reasons that can be cited, and they fall generally into two major categories—the imperative reasons and the ancillary, or spin-off benefits. It is imperative, in the Cold War arena, that the United States be first for reasons of national security, national pride of achievement, and the international prestige. The ancillary . . . reasons include the benefits of scientific discovery; the stimulation of economic and social progress; technological advancement, including the civilian application and utilization of the products of space-oriented research; and the compelling urge of man to explore and to discover.” (Text)
• Edward Z. Gray, Director of NASA’s Advanced Manned Missions Pro-
gram, in an interview with Missile Space Daily, said that the logical step toward manned flights to Mars “would be a nine-man space
station, about the same size as a crew module on a planetary flight which would be continuously deployed and periodically supplied.” He added, however, that such a station was “beyond the FY ’68 budget.”
Gray said that meanwhile NASA would continue its study program on planetary flight. Propulsion was the limiting factor, he explained; other problems such as power, life support, and communications were expected to evolve satisfactorily by the late 1970’s. He foresaw the possibility of a manned flyby mission around Mars by the mid-1970’s.
“Development of a new launch vehicle is probable in another four or five years,” he said, “and a reusable system is a ‘good bet.’ Large solids will also be a candidate and could be competitive with the best of the others until the reusable vehicle comes along.” Even then, Gray saw a division of labor in which solids would handle payloads in the l-to-5-million-lb. class and reusable vehicles would concentrate on
20,000-to-50,000-lb. payloads. Reusable solids were also under consideration. (M/S Daily, 7/27/65)

July 29: Dr. Robert B. Leighton, Cal Tech professor, summarized the results of the mariner iv mission to President Johnson in a White House ceremony during which the remaining photos transmitted by the spacecraft were presented to the President and the Nation. Dr. Leighton said: “Man’s first close-up look at Mars has revealed the scientifically startling fact that at least part of its surface is covered with large craters. . . .
“The existence of Martian craters is demonstrated beyond question; their meaning and significance is, of course, a matter of interpretation. The seventy craters clearly distinguishable on Mariner photos Nos. 5 through 15, range in diameter from three to 75 miles. It seems likely that smaller craters exist, and there also may be still larger ones than those photographed, since the Mariner photographs, in total, sampled only about one percent of the Martian surface.
“The observed craters have rims rising a few hundred feet above the surrounding surface and depths of a few thousand feet below the rims. Crater walls so far measured seem to slope at angles up to about 10 degrees.
“The number of large craters per unit area on the Martian surface is closely comparable to the densely cratered upland areas of the Moon.”
Dr. Leighton said that no earth-like features were recognized and that clouds “were not identified and the flight path did not cross either polar cap.”
Some of the fundamental inferences drawn from the MARINER IV photos were:
“1. In terms of its evolutionary history, Mars is more Moon-like than Earth-like. Nonetheless, because it has an atmosphere, Mars may shed much light on early phases of Earth’s history.
“2. Reasoning by analogy with the Moon, much of the heavily cratered surface of Mars must be very ancient—perhaps two to five billion years old.
“3. The remarkable state of preservation of such an ancient surface leads us to the inference that no atmosphere significantly denser than the present very thin one has characterized the planet since that surface was formed. Similarly, it is difficult to believe that free water in quantities sufficient to form streams or to fill oceans could have existed anywhere on Mars since that time. The presence of such amounts of water (and consequent atmosphere) would have caused severe erosion over the entire surface.
“4. The principal topographic features of Mars photographed by Mariner have not been produced by stress and deformation originating within the planet, in distinction to the case of the Earth. Earth is internally dynamic giving rise to mountains, continents, and other such features, while evidently Mars has long been inactive. The lack of internal activity is also consistent with the absence of a significant magnetic field on Mars as was determined by the Mariner magnetometer experiment.
“5. As we had anticipated, Mariner photos neither demonstrate nor preclude the possible existence of life on Mars. The search for a fossil record does appear less promising if Martian oceans never existed. On the other hand, if the Martian surface is truly in its primitive form, the surface may prove to be the best—perhaps the only —place in the solar system still preserving clues to original organic development, traces of which have long since disappeared from Earth.”
Dr. Leighton noted that “one of the most difficult problems associated with the Mariner photographic mission to Mars was the wide illumination range” that was encountered. Assisting Dr. Leighton in his presentation were: Prof. Bruce C. Murray, Cal Tech; Prof. Robert P. Sharp, Cal Tech; Richard K. Sloan, jpl; and J. Denton Allen, jpl. President Johnson said he was a bit relieved that mariner’s photographs “didn’t show more signs of life out there.” He described the Mars pictures as “awe-inspiring” and said that “the flight of Mariner 4 will stand as one of the great advances of man’s quest to extend the horizons of human knowledge.”
President Johnson presented the following awards: to Dr. William H. Pickering, Director of JPL, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal;
to Jack N. James, Assistant Director of jpl for Lunar and Planetary Projects, the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement; and to Oran W. Nicks, Director of Lunar and Planetary Programs, the NASA Medal of Outstanding Leadership. (Transcript; Sullivan, NYT, 7/30/65; Simons, Wash. Post, 7/30/65, Al, A3)
July 29: During mariner iv press conference at nasa Hq., nasa Administrator James E. Webb, in response to a question about the possibility of “another Mariner mission in the relatively near future,” replied: “We had decided some time ago not to fly another one of these missions with the equipment we used on mariner iv but to concentrate on much more important work that we can do with advanced equipment.
“So I should say that it’s highly unlikely that we would revive consideration of another flight.”
Mr. Webb said that the mariner iv flight, including the mariner hi attempt that failed, “cost over $100 million.” He continued: “Dr. Pickering and his group with the American industrial companies proved that we could move out from the earth and get to the planet and do what we intended to do. . . .
“Second, the scientific experimenters worked in close harmony, and the relationship between the experimenters and the people responsible for making the flight get to its destination and bring the data back was I think a very outstanding achievement and also is a part of the learning process in the space program.
“Lastly, it certainly is very important, as we have emphasized in the manned spaceflight program, to gain some knowledge, even though it is not full and complete, at as early a stage as possible, because we have planned a broad-based program over a ten-year period. But we also have the capability of change and modification in the program. And this gives us a good deal of information that in my view will have a strong bearing on the decisions to be made in the 1967 budget.”
Mr. Webb said that he did not see “very much difference between our capability and their [Soviet] capability at this time but that we are both moving into a period when we will be able to select certain options for further emphasis and development.”
It was revealed that the results of the mariner iv mission would be published in Science.

July 29: Ball and roller bearings assembled according to the Lewis Hardness Differential Guide could be expected to have four to five times greater fatigue life, NASA announced. The Guide was developed by a NASA Lewis Research Center team of engineers whose tests showed that bearing load capacity and fatigue life were greatest when the rolling elements of the bearing were between one and two points harder (measured on the Rockwell C Scale) than the races. Manufacturers usually made bearings with balls and races of the same hardness, (nasa Release 65-246; lrc Release 65-51)
•	Rep. Charles McC. Mathias (R-Md.), advocating increased research
in weather modification, introduced in the House a bill (H.R. 10173) requiring a study of current public and private efforts and a Presidential report thereon: “The science of weather modification is still in its infancy, but it is a very active youth. Public and private efforts in this field have expanded greatly in the past decade. Several Federal agencies, primarily the Department of Commerce, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Departments of Interior and Defense, have increased their support of atmospheric research to a total Federal investment of $3,529,683 in fiscal 1964. . . .
“Before committing this country to such a massive and sustained effort, we should know where we stand now. A comprehensive Presidential report such as the one required by my bill would give the Congress and the Nation the fundamental information which we need before attempting to evaluate expert recommendations on methods and goals. For, like nuclear physics, the science of weather modification has an infinite capacity for mischief or for good. We must be sure that man’s efforts to tame the elements proceed along paths beneficial to mankind.” (CR, 7/29/65, 18071)

July 30: PEGASUS ill meteoroid detection satellite was launched into orbit from Eastern Test Range, with a Saturn I booster—last(sA-lO) in a series of ten launch vehicle test flights. Initial orbital data: apogee, 336 mi. (541.9 km.); perigee, 324 mi. (522.6 km.); period, 95.5 min.; inclination, 28.9°. Main assignment of the 3,200-lb. spacecraft with wing-like panels was to add information on the
frequency of meteoroids in near-earth environment, for use in the design of future manned and unmanned spacecraft. Eight of its detachable panels carried 352 thermal surface samples collected from the aerospace industry. If NASA should program an astronaut-PEGASUS III rendezvous, the astronaut would detach as many panels as possible and return them to earth for study. Also orbited was Apollo command and service module boilerplate (bp-9), which served as shroud for pegasus III. Apollo launch escape system was jettisoned during launch vehicle’s ascent.
pegasus ill—expected to return meteoroid data to ground stations for at least one year—was identical to pegasus II, in orbit since May 25, 1965. pegasus I was sent into orbit Feb. 16, 1965. (nasa Release 65-232; msfc Release 65-185; msfc Release 65-190)
July 30: NASA’s seven-year Saturn I program was concluded with the successful launch of pegasus iii. It marked the tenth success in as many attempts for the Saturn I booster. A significant development of the program was the clustering of several large rocket engines: the power plant in the first stage of the Saturn I was a cluster of eight H-l engines each with 188,000 lbs. of thrust to give this stage 1,504,000 lbs. of thrust. The first four flight tests (sa-1 through SA-4) were with dummy upper stages; beginning with SA-5, both stages (s-l and S—iv) were “live”; and the last three Saturn I’s each orbited a Pegasus. Other significant developments growing out of the Saturn I program included:
“1. First extensive use of multi-engines (six RL-10-a3’s) and liquid hydrogen in the upper stages.
“2. Advancement of guidance and instrumentation technology.
“3. Facility expansion, and development of new transportation modes for large rockets.
“4. Orbiting meteoroid technology satellites, the largest instrumented satellites launched to date.
“5. Developing the capability of placing into earth orbit payloads of more than 37,000 pounds.
“6. Developing guidance and instrumentation technology which could be used in other programs.” (nasa Release 65-253)

•	Commenting on the success of mariner iv, a New York Times editorial
said: “A whole host of new sciences is being born—extraterrestrial geology most obviously among them. By learning more about Mars—even a lifeless Mars—men will understand better the origin of the solar system. And, by being able to compare the red planet in greater detail with this earth, new understanding will evolve of why there is life here and, apparently, none there. The exploration of the planets has begun and more than one generation will be required to finish that task. But, so long as men stand on this puny globe and gaze wonderingly at the lights in the sky, they will remember that the first successful pioneer was named Mariner 4.” {NYT, 7/30/65, 24C)

editorial comment in the Washington Post:
“. . . If some people are disappointed because Mariner 4 did not produce any conclusive documentation on the existence of the long-suspected life on Mars, it should be remembered that this was not one of Mariner 4’s objectives. Even the Tiros, circling earth at far less distance from its surface than Mariner 4 was from Mars, has indicated only once in the thousands of pictures taken that the life we know exists here actually can be spotted from far out in space.” (Wash. Post, 7/31/65)
During July: The support of science in the U.S. was discussed by Dael Wolfle in the Scientific American:
“From 1953 until 1960 about 8 percent of the Nation’s research and development budget was devoted to basic research. The percentage has been rising since 1960, reaching almost 12 percent in 1965. As for the Federal Government’s funds, in 1953, less than 7 percent went for basic research. The figure has been rising since 1960, to about 11 percent in 1965. The universities are relatively much more prominent in basic research than in the total research and development effort, being responsible for almost half of all basic research. In contrast the industrial laboratories, which dominate in development activity, conduct only about a fourth of the basic research.” (CR, 7/14/65, A3760-61)
•	Inventors of Lunar Landing Research Vehicle, lunar landing simulator
referred to as “the belching spider,” in use at nasa Flight Research Center, were granted a patent. Built by Bell Aerosystems Co. under contract to NASA, the research craft had a jet engine that supported five-sixths of its weight; the pilot would manipulate lift rockets that would support the remaining one-sixth. The craft’s attitude would be controlled with jets of hydrogen peroxide. Inventors were Kenneth L. Levin and John G. Allen, Jr., of the Bell staff. (Jones, NYT, 7/3/65, 23)

•	In answer to the query, “What is an orbital analyst?” an article
in The Airman said: “The complex tasks of the analyst involve
the use of a high order of mathematics, laws of celestial mechanics, and adaptation of orbital analysis problems to high-speed scientific computer solutions. These highly specialized activities are absolutely essential to carrying out the vast mission of the Air Force SPACETRACK system: detection, tracking, and identification of all man-made objects orbiting the earth.” (Airman, 7/65, 24)
During July: Fortune magazine recounted the story of the development of the Lear jet—a small jet aircraft for the corporate market. William Lear, said the article, became the first man in history to design, build, and win certification for a jet airplane—all with his own money. {Fortune, 7/65, 137-140, 185)
•	Prospects for U.S.-European industrial cooperation in space were dis-
cussed in Air Force and Space Digest by Elmer P. Wheaton, Vice President of Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. Wheaton offered four “guiding principles” for any program of U.S.-European industrial effort:
“The program to be jointly undertaken should avoid unnecessary duplication of an existing program. . . .
“The project or program should contribute to a better understanding of the space environment. . . .
“The program must provide a logical extension of our current space technology. . . .
“The program must not require such a substantial increase of knowledge in either the space environment or the space technology that it involves a high risk of failure. . . .”
Wheaton suggested: scientific areas that could be usefully investigated by Europe; advanced programs for “more distant European ex,-ploration”; and satellites that could be profitably developed by Europe —notably, applications satellites. In such company-to-company cooperation, contribution of the U.S. companies should be chiefly in space systems management. (AF Mag., 7/65, 53-57)
•	European contributions to international space communications were
recommended by Dalimil Kybal, Senior Consulting Scientist, Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. Summary of his article in Air Force and Space Digest:
“Contrary to the views of those Europeans who tend to think of European and American space communications systems as separate entities, existing international agreements clearly call for a global system. Europe, as it develops space technology skills, ought to concentrate on developing next-generation satellites as replacements for existing hardware, in keeping with the competitive approaches contemplated in the international agreement. . . .” (AF Mag., 7/65, 60-61)
•	Soviet aircraft designer Oleg K. Antonov provided technical and per-
formance specifications of the large An-22 aircraft during an interview conducted by J. Marmain for Wehr und Wirtschaft (W. Germany) : first flight was made in February 1965; aircraft shown at International Air Show, Paris, was transport model; considerable rebuilding, including 15-m. extension of the tail, would be required for the craft to accommodate 720 passengers. Antonov said his design office was not concerned with development of a passenger version of the An-22, a new version of the An-24 for 64 passengers, and a
smaller special purpose aircraft. (Marmain, Wehr und Wirtschaft, 7/65, 390-91)
During July: Paul Tillich, Protestant theologian, commenting upon the “Pacem in Terris” of Pope John xxm, wrote: “A . . . genuine hope for peace is the technical union of mankind by the conquest of space. Of course, nearness can intensify hostility; and the fact that the first manifestations of the technical oneness of the world were two world wars proves this possibility. But nearness can also have the opposite effect. It can change the image of the other as strange and dangerous; it can reduce self-affirmation and effect openness for other possibilities of human existence and—particularly as in the encounter of religions— of other possibilities of genuine faith.” (Tillich, “The Limits of Peace,” Chicago Today, Summary 1965, 2-5)

Weighing about 60 lbs., unit was designed for use with water-cooled undergarment astronauts would wear beneath a spacesuit during lunar surface exploration. Water-cooled undergarment would cool the astronaut by conducting the metabolic heat generated by his motions into water which would circulate through a web of plastic tubing in contact with the skin. Water would carry
the heat into the portable life support system which would recool and recirculate it. Contract called for delivery of 52 packs.
Testing of the undergarment and the Piss would be conducted at msc. (Houston Post, 8/3/65)
August 2: ComSatCorp received a check from at&t for use of 60 channels on EARLY BIRD I comsat during its first month of operation. It was the first operating revenue ComSatCorp had had; previous income had been interest on the $200 million received from sale of stock to the public. The AT&T check was only half as much as had been expected originally; ComSatCorp’s initial estimates had been based on expectation that at&t would use 100 channels on early bird I. {Wash. Post, 8/3/65)
• Alternate methods for re-establishing communications with mariner iv on its next closest approach to earth around Sept. 4, 1967, were being considered by Mariner project planners at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Aviation Week and Space Technology reported: (1) attempted reacquisition beginning in early February 1967, making use of the spacecraft’s high-gain directional antenna to obtain data from the spacecraft for up to 10 mo.; (2) reliance solely on mariner iv’s low-gain antenna for transmission, permitting two-way communications for four to six weeks around September 1967. In the 10-mo. plan, reacquisition would be initiated when the spacecraft was about 135 million mi. from earth. Due to relative sun-earth positions in February 1967, the angle at which the high-gain directional antenna would be permanently fixed would enable it to' be aimed at the earth by having mariner iv roll about its longitudinal axis, which would be pointed at the sun. The 100-kw. transmitter at Goldstone tracking station would send the necessary commands to mariner iv. In the latter plan, use of the 210-ft. antenna, expected to become operational at Goldstone in January 1966, could extend reception of intelligible telemetry signals to as long as six weeks, compared with four using the standard 85-ft. dishes of the Deep Space Network.
W. A. Collier, assistant Mariner project manager at jpl, told Aviation Week that mariner iv would be of particular scientific interest in 1967. First, there were no other interplanetary probes being sent away from the sun at that period. Second, when mariner iv passed within 6,000 mi. of Mars July 14, the gravitational pull of the planet had tilted the plane of the spacecraft out of the plane of the ecliptic. mariner iv, 5.3 million mi. above the ecliptic in September 1967, would give scientists their first chance to compare interplanetary findings outside this plane with those obtained in it.
Preliminary estimates were that the 10-mo. plan would cost between $5 million and $15 million, while the four-to-six-week project would cost less than $1 million.
mariner iv, launched Nov. 28, 1964, was in solar orbit with a period of 567.11 days, perihelion of 103.1 million mi., and aphelion of 146.2 million mi. (Watkins, Av. Wk., 8/2/65, 32)

•	There exists a serious misunderstanding about the U.S. space program,
Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, told the Tenth Symposium on Space and Ballistic Missile Technology in San Diego: “All too many people seem to have the impression that part of our program is peaceful in intent while the other part is something different, presumably non-peaceful. This misconception goes further by attempting to identify the non-peaceful and the non-scientific with the military and to credit the peaceful and scientific to the civilian. . . . The fact is—in both policy and practice —that all of our space activities are peaceful. . . . Just in case it may have been forgotten, let me quote from our highest policy level. In 1962, President Johnson, then Vice President and the Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, stated: ‘The United States does not have a division between peaceful and non-peaceful objectives for space but rather has space missions to help keep the peace and space missions to improve our ability to live well in peace. . . .’
“In 1964, as President, he said: ‘Our space program, in both its civil and military aspects, is peaceful in purpose and practice. . . .’
“I . . . am not saying that space cannot be used for purposes of aggression ... no nation should bury itself in sands of complacency and thereby neglect to develop the technological and military strength so necessary for deterring potential aggressors. The maintenance of such strength in no respect conflicts with the policy of peace. In fact, the more competent we are to prevent surprise, to discover aggressive maneuvers, and to intercept hostile weapons in any medium, the better chance we have of living in peace. . . .
“When I state, therefore, that our entire national space program is peaceful, I mean that we have no aggressive intent, that we seek no domination over other peoples, and that we are eager to share the benefits of space exploration with all mankind.” (Text)

“We have deployed one or. two so-called ‘satellite killers,’ but they are a pitiful particle of what really is needed.
“Pictures of Mars are fine. So is a trip to the moon. But the first job of any administration is to secure the nation against its enemies.

•	“Absence of proper space laws may lead to dangerous conflicts and com-
plications not only in this sphere of man’s activities but also1 in purely terrestrial affairs,” said Genadii Zhukov, scientific secretary of the Soviet Space Law Commission in an interview with Krasnaya Zvezda. The resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 13, 1963, had confirmed that outer space was open to all states. However, he stressed, the resolution made special reservations about the imper-
missibility of using sputniks for war propaganda and for inciting enmity between peoples: “All states must refrain from potentially harmful experiments in outer space or any other steps liable to interfere with the peaceful use of such space by other countries.”
Zhukov noted that in connection with the prospects of creating permanent orbital stations, the need would arise to determine their legal status, as well as conditions of their use by other countries. As human beings made further inroads into outer space, the problem of determining the legal status of stations and settlements on the moon and on other celestial bodies, the conditions for tapping their natural resources, would become important. He added: “Space law must also guarantee protection of other living worlds if such are discovered on distant planets.” (Tass, 8/4/65)

The moon might be turned into a military base. Ways might be found to cascade radioactive waves upon an enemy’ and there might he other equally' deadly spatial advances. The same opinion is held by highly placed military officers.
“As General Ferguson of the Air Force put it a couple of years ago, in urging the swiftest possible development of an American ‘military patrol’ in space, no one even dimly foresaw the nuclear bomber when the airplane began to operate a half-century ago.

tion at Michoud seems to have escaped general attention in discussions about space missions and the rocket assemblies assigned or assignable to carry them out. These and other factors are significant in connection with efforts under way, just coming to light, to intrude on, supplant or degrade the SI-B in the Apollo or other programs for which it is fitted.
“The first of the ‘new Saturns,’ or intermediate Saturns, of the Chrysler Corporation’s Space Division has reached Cape Kennedy for the initial lift-off in tests and flights that will lead to human exploration of the moon.
“Payload requirements vary of course for different objectives of this 12-shot series. Regardless of what is first put aloft, the i-b assembly is designed to send into desired orbit 36,000 pounds of functional vehicle—not to mention the 30,000 pounds of a burned-out second-stage, should that lagniappe be added.
“This rating compares with the 26,000-pound payload Soviet spacemen boosted into orbit last July 16; with 21,000 pounds sent into orbit by the Titan 3-C June 18; with the rated 25,000-pound payload capacity of the Titan 3-C; with the 22,000-pound payload rating of the ‘old Saturn’; with the 18,000-pound payload dispatched by an ‘old Saturn’ a year or two ago; and with 4,000 pounds orbited by the Atlas.” {CR, 8/19/65, A4674)

• Photographs of Mars returned by NASA mariner iv showed surface features which could be interpreted as possible Martian canals, wrote Eric Burgess, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in London in a letter to the Society. Burgess interpreted a dark, 30-mi.-wide streak shown on photograph No. 11 as a rift valley. This surface feature occurred at the same location on Mars where some astronomers claimed to have seen canals. Burgess said the photograph revealed that the escarpments passed through the rim of a large lOO-mi.-wide Martian crater, indicating that this particular rift valley appeared after the formation of the crater.

August 15: ZOND Ill’s lunar photography mission was announced by Tass: “Automatic station Zond 3 is continuing its flight along a heliocentric orbit. . . . Photography of the moon began on July 20, 36 hrs. after launch, at 0424 hrs., Moscow time, when the automatic station was at a distance of 11,600 km. from the lunar surface, and was concluded at 0532 hrs. at a distance of about 10,000 km. After the lunar flyby the station is continuing its motion in a heliocentric orbit, becoming increasingly more distant from the earth and the sun. Image transmission began in accordance with the program of July 29 at a distance of 2.2 million km., when the angular size of the earth was small enough for the precise tuning of the on-board parabolic antenna towards the earth. Zond 3 for the first time photographed a part of the moon that cannot be seen from the earth and which was not included in the photos made by the Soviet interplanetary station in October 1959. At the moment photography began the phase of the moon visible from Zond 3 was close to full moon, while when the photography ended almost
half of the lunar disc was in shadow. The first frames show a considerable part of the moon visible from the earth. Later frames show the surface of the moon when there was considerable solar side illumination, when the relief formations cast distinct shadows. The images from Zond 3 are sent with a clarity of 1,100 lines. When photographing from a distance of the order of 10,000 km., images of a lunar surface area of about 5 million square km. are possible. The quality of the photographs obtained make it possible to see numerous details of the lunar relief, which are of considerable interest. The photo obtained from Zond 3 will be published in leading newspapers and scientific journals. To analyze the result obtained and to name the craters, ranges, and other formations on the newly photographed sections of the moon, the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. has set up a special commission. Scientific investigations are continuing on Zond 3. For further testing of the radio line the transmission of photographs of the far side of the moon from the station will continue during subsequent communications sessions, right up to the greatest distance from the earth. Thirty-eight communications sessions have been conducted from Zond 3. All on-board systems are functioning normally.” (Izvestia, 8/15/65, 1)
August 15: zond ill’s photographs of the hidden side of the moon received editorial comment in the New York Times: “Scientists and laymen from all nations will look forward to the pictures of the dark side of the moon that Moscow reports its Zond 3 satellite took last month. UnitI then the only photographic intelligence on the area had come from the pictures an earlier Soviet satellite took in 1959, a time when the available equipment—and consequently the quality of the result— was primitive by present standards. Six years ago' the marvel was that this feat could be accomplished at all. Now, in the wake of the photographic knowledge of the moon and of Mars obtained by this country’s Ranger and Mariner vehicles, world judgment of the importance of the Soviet accomplishment will depend upon the quality and the quantity of the new knowledge it provides.” (NYT, 8/16/65, E9)
•	Comparing luna in [lunik ill] and zond ill, H. Pfaffe said in an article
in East Germany’s Berliner Zeitung: “Owing to its trajectory, Zond 3 was able to photograph the moon under favorable illumination conditions for one hour and eight minutes. Luna 3 was able to photograph only 40 minutes. Zond 3’s trajectory was so chosen that the probe assumed a planetary orbit around the sun. Luna 3, on the other hand, assumed an elliptical orbit with the earth as one focal point. While Luna 3 transmitted its photos of the moon from distances of 400,000 km. and 40,000 km., Zond 3 began to transmit from a distance of 2,200,000 km. This and the fact that the new photos were on a 1,100-line basis indicated the advances made in the Soviet radio and photographic systems.” (Pfaffe, Berliner Zeitung, 8/15/65, 3)

Dr. Bisplinghoff would then become Special Assistant to NASA Administrator James E. Webb in the advanced research and technology field. (nasa Release 65-274)
August 16: Robert Hotz commented in an Aviation Week and Space Technology editorial: “The summer of 1965 seems destined to appear in space history as a period of formidable success in extending the horizons of man’s efforts to explore his universe. The two spectacular achievements of Mariner 4 and Gemini 4 have been interspersed with several other milestones in space technology as the summer unfolded.
“Even after all the millions of words that have been poured out in describing the amazing feats of the Mariner 4 spacecraft, it is difficult to comprehend the full magnitude of its achievements. The 228-day voyage of Mariner 4 across 135 million mi. to the vicinity of Mars, and its transmission of the first relatively close-up pictures of that planet back across the void to earth, probably will rank as the most spectacular feat of space exploration in the first decade since Sputnik 1.
“More than any other space flight since the first manned space mission by Vostok 1, this successful reconnaissance of Mars has demonstrated the infinite possibilities that lie ahead in obtaining a truly scientific grasp of the universe around us. The evidence that was provided by the Mariner 4 photographs was a scientific discovery of the first magnitude and certainly showed the limitations of earth-based astronomy. But perhaps its real significance lies in the demonstration that a complex spacecraft can voyage, communicate, and function over the vast reaches of space under human control and command from earth. . . .
“There is little doubt that the U.S. space program would not be operating at its present pace or scope without the early, humiliating prod of the Soviet Union’s pioneering in this field. However, the results now being produced from the U.S. program are proving so1 useful in such a variety of applications that there should be little doubt that it is worth pursuing for its own goals, even without the stimulus of international competition. It may well be that when historians write of the space age they will point to the summer of 1965 as the time when the U.S. effort finally reached maturity and began breaking its own new ground, in contrast to the earlier era of sternchasing the Soviets.” (Hotz, Av. Wk., 8/16/65, 21)
• NASA was seeking buyers for rocket launches, and the improved Delta, incorporated into the launch package, might prove most economical, William S. Beller reported in Missiles and Rockets. Cost of launching the Delta, either to low-earth orbit or into interplanetary space, would be the same. Cost to send a package to the moon would be $16,000/ lb.; on a Mars flyby, $21,000/lb.
Beller’s article continued: “It is ironic that the fabulously successful series of Delta rockets is based on much of the hardware and concepts used in the presumed failure called Vanguard. In 1959, the Air Force took the upper two Vanguard stages, mounted them on Thor, and called the combination Thor-Able. NASA then made minor modifications in the vehicle’s coast attitude-control system and put
in a new auto-pilot control system; but the basic Thor-Able shell was used. This was the Delta that failed in its first firing in 1960 with an Echo satellite payload. The subsequent Deltas orbited their payloads in 22 successive launchings.
“The Vanguard program, too, besides giving birth to Delta was probably one of the most economical buys of the U.S. space program. Originally budgeted for a total cost of $20 million, Vanguard ended up costing $105 million, which was paid not only for development of the Vanguard hardware and several launchings but also for setting up the worldwide Minitrack network used in Project Mercury.
“Improvements in Delta from 1960 to the present involved using more energetic propellants, lengthening the second-stage tanks, replacing the third-stage motor for a more active one, adding solid strap-ons to the first stage, and again enlarging the second stage.
“The result is an inexpensive and reliable bus whose launch can be bought for less than $3.5 million.” (Beller, M&R, 8/16/65, 24)

mission: “Like the Ranger and Mariner feats before it, Zond 3 has again shown what enormous gains in man’s knowledge can be obtained by using instruments alone, a technique much cheaper and less hazardous than sending men to the moon or the planets. There is every reason to suppose that a United States satellite could have gotten similar photographs of the other side of the moon even earlier than Zond 3 had a sustained effort to this end been made.
“The restraining element has been the limitations imposed on this country’s exploration of space with instrument-carrying rockets by the overriding priority given to the enormously expensive Apollo project for landing a man on the moon by 1970. The Soviet propaganda and prestige gains that will result from the current accomplishment represent one of the costs of the decision to put so much emphasis upon a manned voyage to the moon.” (NYT, 8/17/65, 30)

“Before the end of this decade, man will have set foot on the Moon’s surface. This will be an event of historical magnitude.
“By 1970, manned satellite stations will be circling the Earth for a month or more. A crew of three or four will be on board, performing many kinds of scientific experiments, ranging from astronomy to zoology. Much larger manned space stations could become a reality in future years.	_
“Before the end of the next 5 years, world-wide communication by means of satellites will be a routine accomplished fact, as will detailed
observation of weather patterns and collection of meteorological data around the globe.
“Radio and TV broadcasting to large areas of the Earth from satellites could become a reality in the next 10 years.
“Before 1975 unmanned vehicles from Earth will be circling Mars and Venus and sending exploratory probes to the planets’ surfaces.
“To look into the future beyond 1975 is much more uncertain, but experts judge that if Man has the desire and will, he can have gone, by 1985, a long way toward the goal of sending a manned expedition to Mars, perhaps with the aid of some kind of nuclear propulsion. . . .” (Text)
Leonard Jaffe, Director of NASA Communication and Navigation Programs, told the Conference that recent announcement that DOD’s navigation satellite system was operational demonstrated the great potential of artificial earth satellites for providing position determinations to the maritime industry. He said NASA had under study a number of techniques, different from those employed in the DOD system, by which satellites located in medium or synchronous orbits could provide position fixes to ships and aircraft. Techniques whereby the craft’s position would be determined at ground computer stations might make the satellite system attractive to U.S. industry, he said.
For the future Jaffe foresaw the combination of a position determination method and a communications system integrated into a single satellite to provide capability of aiding in air traffic control. He said: “Accurate position data and reliable communications readily available to air traffic controllers by use of satellites may provide the answer to the acute problem of safely reducing the present separation standard of aircraft flying across the crowded Atlantic Ocean region. Similar data supplied to a maritime regulatory agency may provide a means for preventing marine collisions.” (Text)
August 18-20: Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, afsc Commander, participating in a panel discussion on the “Social Implications of Space Exploration,” said: “. . . there are two ways of looking at space. The first way is simply as a place—as the vast expanse which is an extension of the earth’s atmosphere in every direction, and which can serve as an operational environment. There is much we need to discover about this region, but it is already clear that space adds a new dimension to our thinking about national security.
“Space has at least four unique characteristics which offer advantages for military operations. These are: first, extremely high altitudes which offer line of sight to large areas of the earth’s surface; second, very high speeds; third, almost infinite flight duration; and fourth, highly predictable flight paths.
“These recognized advantages have led to the development of a number of space systems which provide support to military land, sea, and air operations. These include satellite systems for communications, weather, and navigation. The capabilities they provide are either unique or represent a distinct improvement over other means of accomplishing the same task . . .
“On the other hand, the advantages of space are frequently offset by several disadvantages. The first of these is the cost of launching payloads into space. Presently this amounts to about $1000 a pound
in low earth orbit, although it is estimated that the Titan ill will reduce this figure to about $500 a pound, and we foresee methods of reducing the cost to the neighborhood of $100 a pound. The second is the requirement for extremely high reliability—the need to build satellites that will operate for long periods without maintenance and repair. Third is the absence of a demonstrated method of returning from space to a controlled landing at a specified point. And fourth is the environment of space itself—the problems associated with hard vacuum, temperature extremes, and intense radiation.
“The need to overcome these disadvantages leads to consideration of the second way in which space may be regarded—not merely as a place, but as a primary focus for man’s scientific and technological efforts in the years ahead. The success of these efforts will determine the practical use that can be made of space for a variety of purposes, including military purposes.” (Text)
August 19: Gemini V launch counted down to T-10 min. before it was canceled and reset for Aug. 21. Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper (L/Col., usaf) and Charles Conrad, Jr., (Lcdr., usn) were disappointed, but took the delay in stride. Cooper commented: “. . . you promised a launch today and not a wet mock.”
Five hours before the scheduled launch, computer studies suggested that the liquid hydrogen in the spacecraft’s fuel cells was boiling off too quickly. Engineers’ attempts to force additional liquid hydrogen into the fuel cells succeeded only in hastening the escape of hydrogen gas. Finally, a colder liquid hydrogen was used with success. Ten minutes before lift-off, apparent troubles with a telemetry programer caused another hold in the countdown. During a thunderstorm, a lightning-induced power surge affected the electrical instruments.
At 5:00 p.m., edt, as NASA officials were opening a press conference, they were informed that a fire had broken out in a communications cable linking the Gemini v launch complex with mission control center.

First stage of the booster burned for 156.8 sec. Second stage then separated, burned for 179.6 sec. Traveling at 17,605 mph. 7,947-lb. gemini v was inserted into orbit: apogee. 215.4 mi. (347.4 km.); perigee, 100 mi. (161.3 km.}; period, 89.58 min.; inclination to the equator, 32.6°.
Fifty-six minutes after liftoff, astronauts fired thruster rockets to raise the perigee to 106 mi, (179.9 km.) in preparation for rendezvous with Rep, a practice maneuver to prepare for Gemini 6’s rendezvous in orbit with an Agena stage. At beginning of 2nd orbit-astronauts ejected Rep from the adapter section behind the spacecraft. Rep moved away at five miles per hour.
About two hours after insertion of gemini V into orbit, oxygen pressure for the new fuel cell dropped from 800 to 60 lbs. psi because of a failure in the heater element circuitry. This pressure-drop severely reduced the fuel cell’s output of electrical power. The Rep experiment was abandoned and there was some apprehension as to whether the flight could continue.
At 27 hrs, into the flight. Cooper and Conrad successfully locked their spacecraft radar on a spare Rep transponder mounted on a tower at NASA Merritt Island Launch Area during a six-minute pass. Oxygen pressure began building up in the fuel-cell system and hopes of completing the mission were raised.
On Aug. 23, as gemini y made its 32nd revolution around the earth, the spacecraft began a series of maneuvers to rendezvous with a simulated Agena upper stage in lieu of the Rep experiment. By the 34th orbit gemini v was only 16 mi. behind the simulated Agena, very close to the planned 15-mi. separation NASA hoped to have on GEMINI VI prior to final closing and docking maneuver. Last maneuver was not attempted because of the need to conserve fuel on GEMINI V.
On Aug. 24, Astronauts Cooper and Conrad twice spotted objects on the ground; they observed a Minuteman icbm launch from Vandenberg afb, and tracked and photographed it; they sighted a huge checkerboard design laid out on the ground near Laredo, Tex., and reported direction in the which arrows in the center of the blocks were pointed.
August 21-29: On Aug. 25, the astronauts saw, tracked, and photographed another Minuteman icbm fired from Vandenberg AFB and identified a rocket sled test on Holloman afb. At request of U.S. Weather Bureau, they attempted to photograph the eye of tropical storm Doreen about 200 mi. south of Hawaii.
During the flight, the astronauts both remained in good spirits. Sixteen of the planned seventeen experiments were conducted. Despite the heavy work schedule, Cooper and Conrad each slept about five hours a day. The astronauts ate about 2,000 calories of food a day, less than the 2,900 calories prescribed for the mission, and each drank six pounds of water daily.
Aug. 27 saw problems with the steady accumulation of water in the fuel cell, which threatened to exceed water-storage capacity; faulty attitude and maneuvering thrusters; and the boiling off of hydrogen gas which caused the spacecraft to roll.
On Aug. 28, the fuel cell and the left thruster were functioning well. Conrad reported seeing “a carrier and a destroyer steaming right into Jacksonville”; it was actually a tug pulling a large barge.
On Aug. 29 Cooper and Conrad talked via radio with Astronaut M. Scott Carpenter (Cdr., usn), in Sealab II on the floor of the Pacific off La Jolla, Calif. Approach of Hurricane Betsy from the coast -of South America forced NASA officials to order gemini V to land one revolution early. Two more of gemini v’s thrusters froze, but there was still sufficient steering power to correct minor variations.
To begin reentry, the astronauts fired four braking rockets as the spacecraft passed 700 mi. north of Hawaii. Reentry was normal. gemini v splashed down into the Atlantic at 8:56 a.m. edt, 600 mi. east of Jacksonville—90 mi. off target. A human error in computing the elapsed time of flight caused the target error. Assisted from the capsule by Navy frogmen 45 min. after splashdown, the astronauts were taken by helicopter to U.S.S. Lake Champlain for medical debriefing. (nasa Release 65-262; nasa Proj.

•	An article in Human Events expressed fear that Russian military space
capability surpassed that of the U.S.: “. . . Four times in the past 2 months, Red Star (a newspaper published by the Defense Ministry) has trumpeted the claim that Russia now has orbital space rockets with the capacity of wiping any aggressor off the face of the earth.
“There is no doubt at all about the intended identity of the aggressor and among American scientists back home there is little doubt about the weapon.
“There is little doubt because the United States spent 7 years and $10 million between 1958-65 to plan the nuclear-powered space orbiting system called Project Orion. We have high-ranking scientists who believe the Russians have copied or adapted Orion, which has been declassified since October, 1964. The Russians might easily have cracked the secrecy before that.
“It is a first generation vehicular system that is capable of carrying 8 men and 100 tons of payload to Mars and back. It is a jet-propelled engine or engines powered by a nuclear reactor which, in effect, bombs a shield at the rear of the vehicle and drives it forward. The usual limitations of temperature do not affect this vehicle because the hot debris of the explosions makes only a momentary contact with the shield. The limitations of using full nuclear power are also absent because the reactor is outside the vehicle.
“Guidance, mobility, range, the exchange of crew-members, and the restocking of the payload are all within this space cruiser’s capability. Its potentials as a raider of earth targets, and as an interceptor of
our space satellites, are almost limitless. It may not be the never-never ultimate weapon, but it will do until another comes along.” {CR, 8/25/65, A4807-08)
August 22: New York Times commented on the malfunction of the fuel cell in the GEMINI v spacecraft launched August 21: “Past manned space flights have gone so well in most respects that yesterday’s tension-filled hours were a shock and a surprise. It has all seemed too easy to the millions of television viewers who have observed previous man-in-space experiments. It was natural to assume that once Gemini 5 was so successfully launched, all would once again go more or less as planned. But those intimately involved with these efforts have known all along of the numerous possibilities of trouble. They were not greatly surprised that one of those possibilities for major difficulty—in this case a malfunction of the fuel cell on Gemini 5—turned into reality.
“There will undoubtedly be future emergencies in space. Yesterday’s events are a sobering reminder that the effort to reach the moon during this decade is straining the limits of available technology, and that serious risks are being taken. These hazards are also faced, of course, by the Soviet manned space program. The brave men both countries are sending into space would be the prime beneficiaries of full Soviet-American cooperation that would pool both countries’ knowledge and experience to minimize the dangers inherent in these pioneering efforts.” (NYT, 8/22/65, 10E)

•	Dispatch to Moscow from Tass’ New York correspondent, Leonid
Ponomarev: “The flight of the U.S. spaceship Gemini-5 . . . proceeded normally for only two hours, although the flight program was calculated for eight days.
“The main reason [was] that a new system for providing electric power. . . was being used in the Gemini-5 spacecraft for the first time. . . .
“It is a noteworthy fact that the new system for providing electrical power has never once been tested in spaceflight conditions. From the test stands on earth, the installation was put directly into working conditions in space.
“There are several reasons that explain this haste and a certain degree of risk. The program chiefs were given the task of ‘catching up with the Soviet Union’ at any price regarding the length of flight in space. However, the present power of U.S. rockets and the size of the astronauts’ capsule are utterly inadequate for lifting and storing reliably tested battery-powered electrical power installations, which would weigh more than the new system. U.S. scientists were compelled to rapidly create a system, new in principle, in order to provide power for the Gemini-5 spacecraft for eight days so that it could fulfill its tasks.” (Tass, 8/22/65

August 23: It was too early to set a realistic date for man’s landing on the moon, Mstislav V. Keldysh, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said during a Moscow press conference devoted to the zond iii mission. He explained: “. . . we have . . . learned quite a lot about the surface of the moon. Yet this does not seem to be a great deal . . . where the choice of a landing spot is concerned. . . . Our knowledge of the soil of the moon is still somewhat contradictory, and I think it is much too early to start looking for a future landing site . . .”
Yuri Khodarev, engineer in the Soviet space program, revealed that zond ill had used photographic film instead of magnetic film to record pictures for later playback on earth command. The mission had been essentially a test in which the spacecraft would continue to play back the moon pictures repeatedly at increasingly greater distances up to “hundreds of millions of kilometers,” Khodarev said, adding, “we have created a new, compact photo television system intended for photographing and transmission of images of planets under conditions of prolonged space flight.” The wide-angle camera lens had a 106.4mm. focal length at a relative aperture of 1:8. A 25-mm. film was used with exposures of l/100th and l/300th of a second. Describing the zond Hi television system, Khodarev said zond III had taken 25 photos of the far side of the moon in little more than an hour. Only one command had been given from earth—to start taking the photographs. All remaining operations occurred automatically.
The zond III photographs confirmed earlier conclusions concerning the scarcity of dark depressions on the moon’s reverse side, but also revealed sea-like formations up to 500 km. (310.5 mi.) across and about as long as the maria. These formations differed structurally from the maria and lacked their characteristic dark color. The northern part of the side of the moon was occupied by a bright elevation pitted with craters. Concentration of craters throughout the reverse side of the moon was high.
Soviet astronomer Alla Masevich said the moon photographs were as good as those taken of the visible side from earth-based observatories: “They show beautiful half-tone transitions, reflecting the character of detailed surface relief.”
Alexander A. Mikhailov, director of the Pulkovo Observatory, attributed the observed difference between the moon’s visible side and its reverse side to geological rather than astronomical factors. He noted the appearance on Zond photographs of chains of craters along elongated fracture lines which he attributed to volcanic activity.
Prof. Keldysh noted that the trajectory of zond ill had passed far from the planets but said that “the experience we gained in launching this probe into remote space will be used in subsequent launchings to photograph the planets.” He said the U.S.S.R. had already begun preparations to achieve a soft lunar landing. Experiments aboard the spacecraft were for study of magnetic fields, solar wind, low-frequency radio emission of the galaxy, micrometeors, cosmic rays, and the in-
frared and ultraviolet spectra of the lunar surface. (Tass, 8/23/65; Shabad, NYT, 8/24/65, 1)

• Soviet claim that the gemini v spaceflight was undertaken with “haste
and definite risk” received editorial comment in the Washington Evening Star: “Tass, the official Soviet news agency, should feel a little bit embarrassed at the moment. It has given a big play to a story by Leonid Ponomariov [sic], its New York correspondent. The story has charged that American space officials have been ordered by the Johnson administration to ‘beat the Soviet Union at any price with regard to the duration of orbital flight.’
“. . . our country may indeed be forging ahead. But nothing could be more ridiculous than Ponomariov’s [sic] studied suggestion that Gemini 5 has been put into orbit in a slapdash manner, with callous disregard for the safety of the astronauts aboard, just to steal a space scene from the Soviets. The fuel system and everything else aboard the Cooper-Conrad vehicle are not whimsical improvisations. That has been made dramatically clear by the way in which Gemini’s initial power failure has been eliminated with help from ground control, by the craft’s built-in means of self-correction.
“As a result, it seems fairly certain right now that Astronauts Cooper and Conrad will be able to complete their eight-day mission. . . .

August 24: Gen. Nikolai Kamanin, commander of Soviet cosmonauts, said the premiere showing in Moscow of “A Man Walks in Space”-—film describing the March 18 voskhod ii flight—that Soviet data had helped advance the date of L/Col. Edward White ii’s “walk” in space June 4. Kamanin said: “The Americans had not planned to let a man out until the end of this year. But after our flight they became bolder. A small group of American specialists, with the permission of our government, came to the Soviet Union and talked with cosmonauts [Col. Pavel I.] Belyayev and [L/Col. Aleksey] Leonov about their flight and we didn’t hide anything.”
Questioned by newsman about the visit by “American specialists,” Kamanin said either three or five persons had interviewed the Russian cosmonauts for several days, but he could not recall their names. Kamanin was asked if the visitors were officials of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. “I don’t know,” he replied. “Officially they were here with a television company—allegedly.”

•	The New York Times editorialized: “. . . The care that has marked
every phase of the [Gemini v] flight thus far provides assurance that the decision on whether to call the capsule back to earth before that time will be based solely on the best judgment of the scientific team as to whether any element of needless risk would be involved in keeping the astronauts aloft. Their safety must, of course, take precedence over the fact that the eight-day goal is the most important single objective of the flight.
“This is no maiter of oneupmanship over the Russians, whose Valery Bykovsky stayed up for five days in 1963. The eight days it is hoped to keep Gemini 5 in space are roughly the time that woud be required for a round trip to the moon. If Colonel Cooper and Commander Conrad can function effectively in a state of weightlessness for that long and then return without injury, they will have given strong support to the hypothesis on which the whole program for a manned moonshot is based.
“Whenever that shot is made—and remain convinced that it is foolhardy to chain it to any fixed deadline—it will have to be based on the fullest possible advance knowledge of man’s ability to cope in another environment with challenges his evolution on earth never required him to encounter.” {NYT, 8/26/65, 29N)

At a White House news conference, the President said: “This program will bring us new knowledge about what man is able to do in space. It will enable us to relate that ability to the defense of America. It will develop technology and equipment which will help advance manned and unmanned space flight and it will make it possible to perform very new and rewarding experiments with that, technology and equipment. . . .
“Unmanned flights to test launching, recovery and other basic parts of the system will begin late next year or early 1967. The initial unmanned launch of a fully equipped laboratory is scheduled for 1968. This will be followed later that year by the first of five flights with two-man crews.

August 25: Preparation for landing a man on the moon by 1970 was not the main purpose of the Gemini program as the U.S. contended, according to Krasnaya Zvezda, official newspaper of the Soviet Defense Ministry: “The main purpose is testing the capability of intercepting artificial satellites and conducting reconnaissance from space.” The newspaper said long-range cameras aboard could provide detailed photographs of cities, railroads, posts, and ships, and that the astronauts were also equipped to “carry out visual intelligence.” It noted that GEMINI V was scheduled to pass above Cuba 11 times, North Vietnam 16 times, and China 40 times.

•	DOD would initiate a demonstration program of a high-performance
cryogenic engine in fy 1966, which could provide up to 50% payload increase in the future, Dr. Harold Brown, Director of dod Research and Engineering, told a closed session of the Senate Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee. Brown said that the program, which would be closely coordinated with NASA, would provide the design data necessary to initiate a high-performance engine development program in the future.
Dr. Brown suggested that the 1975-1985 time period might include operational reusable spacecraft, possibly growing out of an Mol program requirement for data return or logistic resupply. He foresaw an evolution of “reentry spacecraft shapes which will provide greater flexibility of operations, enjoy higher reusability, and possess close to the same volumetric efficiency of current reentry spacecraft. These high performance maneuverable reentry spacecraft should be capable of performing missions calling for fast tactical response and greater option in the selection of landing sites. . . .” (Text)
•	Distinction between “orbit” and “revolution” was discussed by John
A. Osmundsen in a New York Times article: “An orbit is simply the completion of a circuit in space.
“A revolution, on the other hand, is two consecutive passages of a satellite over a particular meridian on earth. . . .
“The switch in terminology from orbits to revolutions was desirable for practical reasons involving ground tracking, ground-to-satellite communications and the execution of satellite experiments geared to terrestrial features, such as volcanoes and clouds.
“It is important to make the distinction between orbits and revolutions . . . because a satellite moving east completes an orbit in less time than it takes to complete a revolution. Hence, it will make fewer revolutions than orbits.” (Osmundsen, NYT, 8/26/65, C17)
•	Plans for the exploration of Mars called for an engineering test shot
in 1969 and an unmanned landing in 1971, Robert F. Fellows, NASA program chief for planetary atmospheres, said at Fifth Annual Space Conference at VPI. Additional unmanned Mars landings were scheduled for 1973 and 1975: larger capsules—up to three tons— were expected to' land in the early 1980’s. Fellows said that the 1971 mission would require two pieces of hardware: an orbiter that would circle Mars for up to 50 yrs. and a capsule that would be lowered to the surface of the planet. The orbiter would have a scientific payload up
to 300 lbs. to relay information to earth for about a year. The capsule would penetrate the thin Martian atmosphere protected by a heat shield and, after landing, deploy its instruments, take soil samples, and relay the data to earth. Fellows confirmed that the interplanetary mission after Mars would be to Venus, with Jupiter next, (ap, Wash. Post, 8/26/65, A10)

August 26: Washington Evening Star editorial: “. . . there is no point in trying to argue that the projected ‘manned orbiting laboratory’ is purely scientific in character. It is not purely scientific. It has military potentials of considerable significance, and our country should not apologize to anybody for that fact. The Russians are busy in this field. Why should we ignore it? The simple reality is, as Secretary of State Rusk has warned, that the ocean of space might become a fearsome theater of war in the not distant future.

As President Johnson said, they will provide ‘new knowledge about what man is able to do in space’ and ‘will enable us to relate that ability to the defense of the nation.’

It is we, not they, who have a three or four to one superiority in icbm’s. . . .

of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory project to the Air Force:
“. . . Anxiety arises out of the Air Force commitment to total secrecy in its space operations. . . . [nasa] has pursued a brilliantly successful open public information policy. It has made every American a participant in its exciting conquest of space, aroused the national interest in the whole world of science, stirred the youth of the country to enthusiasm and stimulated national pride. The Vandenberg Air Force Base which will become a major site for MOL launching has operated under a veil of secrecy. . . .
“The Pentagon has not yet devised a policy for informing the public on the man-in-space MOL project. If it continues the Vandenberg policies of the past, the country is going to know very little about MOL. Such secrecy is bound to arouse international suspicions and alarms, particularly since the flights will be over Soviet territory. Either this is primarily a project in the peaceful penetration of space that requires little secrecy; or it is a secret military project that cannot be reconciled with our previous professions.” (Wash.

August 28: Prof. Robert H. Dicke of Princeton Univ. suggested in the Astronomical Journal that a way to map the sun’s shape as a test of Einstein’s theory of relativity would be to use measurements of the orbit of the asteroid Icarus as it passed within 4 million mi. of earth on June 15, 1968. Two peculiarities would make Icarus, discovered
in 1949, valuable for such an experiment: (1) Icarus was the only body in the solar system known to pass inside the orbit of Mercury; and (2) Icarus’ orbit was highly inclined to that of the other planets. Dr. Dicke proposed that measurements be taken when the planet cut across the plane of the earth’s orbit. If the two measured points changed with each close passage to the sun, then the sun would be known to be less than a perfect sphere. And, the amount by which it was not truly spherical would be known precisely.
If the sun’s radius at the equator exceeded its polar radius by as little as 0.005%, the distortion of the sun’s gravitational field that this would cause would be enough to account for 10% of the predicted effect on Mercury’s orbit. But the general theory of relativity had already accounted for the peculiarities in Mercury’s orbit. Therefore, if the distortion were found, the theory must be incorrect. In other words, said Dr. Dicke, gravitational attraction of one body for another must be accounted for, not by relativity, but by some other mechanism. (AIP News, 8/28/65)

August 29: President Johnson commented on the success of the gemini v flight during a news conference at his Texas ranch: “This is a moment of great achievement, not only for astronauts Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, but for those whose hopes have ridden with Gemini 5.
“I am so happy that Mr. Webb and Mr. Seamans, who had so much to do directing this very successful venture, are here to share with us the pride we all feel today, And I deeply regret that our late, beloved President Kennedy, under whose leadership all of this work was so carefully planned and thought out, can’t be here to enjoy the fruits and success of his planning and his forethought.
“The successful completion of the eight-day, 3-million mile flight of the Gemini 5 proves, I think, not only man’s capacity for endurance in space, but it proves that man is in space to stay.
“We can be, and we are enormously proud of every member of our space team. That means all the scientists, and the technicians, and the controllers, and the trackers—to everyone who contributed in any way. As President of this country, I want, this afternoon, to extend the thanks of the entire nation for a job well done. To Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, and to their wonderful families, I want to simply repeat again: we are all very deeply proud of you.
“The difficulties and disappointments of this flight have served to increase our appreciation, respect and trust for the skill and ability of all the men involved—at all their posts of duty. We can face the challenges and opportunities with far greater confidence and certainty —and this is an unmistakable gain.
“Only seven years ago we were neither first nor second in space— we were not in space at all. Today the capacity of this country for leadership in this realm is no longer in valid question or dispute. Openly, proudly, we are proceeding on our course willing always to share our knowledge, our gains with all mankind. I would repeat and renew this country’s invitation to all nations to join together to make this adventure a joint adventure.
“This globe seems smaller today than ever before.
“Somehow the problems which yesterday seemed large and ominous and insoluble today appear less foreboding. As man increases his knowledge of the heavens, why should he fear the unknown on earth? As man draws nearer to the stars, why should he not also draw nearer to his neighbor?
“As we push ever more deeply into the universe—probing its secrets and discovering its way—we must also learn to cooperate across the frontiers that divide earth’s surface.
“No national sovereignty rules in outer space. Those who venture there go as envoys of the human race. Their quest must be for all mankind—and what they find belongs to all mankind. That is the basis of the program of which astronauts Cooper and Conrad are a part. . . .
“This flight of Gemini 5 was a journey of peace by men of peace. Its successful conclusion is a noble moment for mankind—and a fitting opportunity for us to renew our pledge to continue our search for a world in which peace reigns and justice prevails.
“To demonstrate the earnestness of that pledge, and to express our commitment to the peaceful uses of space exploration, I intend to ask as many of our astronauts as possible—when their schedule and program permit—to visit various capitals of the world. Some, I hope, will be able to journey abroad soon.
“Gemini is but the beginning. We resolve to have many more such journeys—in space and on earth—until man at last is at peace with himself.” (Transcript, Pres. Doc., 9/6/65, 170-72)

“. . . the President’s statement . . . should help to dispel . . . fears. He has made clearer than ever that this country sincerely wants full cooperation in space. If Gemini 5’s flight helps to bring that objective closer, its immediate political contribution will rival its enormous gains for science and for technology.” (NYT, 8/30/65, 24C)

August 31; “I certainly have seen nothing in the eight-day data that would lead me to be worried about a 14-day flight,” Dr. Charles A. Berry, chief physician for the astronauts, told reporters at a news briefing in Cocoa Beach. He said that the GEMINI V astronauts were in good physical condition and were returning to normal as quickly as had the pilots of the four-day Gemini GT-4 flight in June. Changes in such indicators as the heart rate and blood pressure characteristics seemed to reflect adaptation to the weightless space environment and, later, to the stress of returning to normal gravity of earth, Dr. Berry explained. Heart rates became lower in space and rose above normal on returning to earth. At first, on return to earth, blood pressure did not respond as promptly as normal to tilt-table tests designed to show how well the circulatory system copes with sudden changes from horizontal to nearly-vertical posture.
Cooper and Conrad lost about 71/. and 81/; lbs. respectively, but had gained most of it back. This loss might have been a response to the space environment but was believed to be partly water loss after reentry while waiting in the sun to be rescued, Berry said. Both seemed to be less tired than their predecessors. (Schmeck, NYT, 9/1/65, 1, 15)

“There has been the direct economic impact on the communities and regions where the major parts of this large national event are centered. There has been introduced into our national economy a wide variety of radically new industrial techniques. There have evolved new standards of excellence in engineering, testing, design, reliability, environment, control, and the skill and dedication of personnel . . .
“In space research, development and exploration, the identity becomes . . . more imperative. Aerospace companies go many routes attempting to achieve that goal. Leading aerospace companies, for example, developed a ‘Zero Defects’ program aimed at reminding, rewinding, and emphasizing to the worker that rejects are expensive and, if undetected, would contribute to tragedy. Other companies have instituted variations of the zero defects promotional program.

• Experts had observed that some plants had an unusual ability to
adapt to the most severe physical conditions, reported Aviatsiya i Kosmonavtika. Plants had been deprived of oxygen or supplied with very small amounts of it, had been exposed to argon or nitrogen atmospheres, and had been exposed to extreme cold in experiments which tested the effects of a simulated Martian climate on plant growth. It had been found that the cucumber, a heat-sensitive variety of plant, could withstand an argon atmosphere and frost; lettuce, tomatoes, beans, turnips, and other plants had been grown in compartments supplied with extremely small amounts of oxygen. This led to the speculation that not only lichens but small shrubs might be indigenous to Mars and that there may in fact be a rich and varied Martian flora. (Aviatsiya i Kosmonavtika, 8/65, 96)

Launch was made Aug. 28, 1964.
Results from Hrir (High Resolution Infrared Radiometer) data had demonstrated: (1) feasibility of complete nighttime surveillance of surface and land features on a global scale; (2) detailed vertical structure of intertropical convergence zone and formation of tropical storms and of frontal zones; (3) capability to detect temperature gradients over earth’s surface under clear skies; (4) applicability of high-resolution radiometry for glaciology, geology, and oceanography.
Apt (Automatic Picture Transmission) system experiments provided almost instantaneous data on clouds for thousands of square miles around Apt ground stations, demonstrating that the system could provide cloud-cover data for almost all local forecast requirements; thus, it would be a basic element in the Tiros Operational Satellite program.
Avcs (Advanced Vidicon Camera System) experiment provided first near-global, relatively high-resolution cloud pictures ever assembled. Proved capabilities of camera assembly and confirmed decision to use it as basis for first operational meteorological satellite system.
On Sept. 3, 1964, during 381st orbit, nimbus i stopped operating. Deterioration of the bearing grease at high temperatures had caused the paddles in the solar array drive system to lock.
Final contact with nimbus i occurred Nov. 20, 1964. Data revealed that (1) all batteries were in trickle charge; (2) voltage regulation had failed; (3) both Pcm and command clock subsystems were operable; (4) spacecraft tape recorders were not operating; and (5) controls power supply had failed, (nasa Proj.

• “The Pentagon has surprised almost everyone with its promptness
in applying the first squeeze of censorship and news management to its new manned orbiting laboratory (mol) program,” wrote William Hines in the Washington Evening Star. “Most people assumed that soon after the military got a manned role in space, it would start classifying it, but few could have foreseen the rapidity with which restrictions came. The elapsed time from President Johnson’s announcement of the start of mol at his press conference last week to the Pentagon’s first fumbling bit on news management was exactly 2 hours. . . .
“Reporters trooping to an mol briefing at the Pentagon were instructed that they would not be allowed to make tape recordings or to
mention the name of the official (Dr. Albert C. Hall, Deputy Director of Research and Engineering), who was briefing them. . . .
“The Defense Department is not the only traducer of a free news flow. The space agency gives news management the old college try every time a manned spacecraft goes up.
“Of all the significant news locations in a Gemini flight, the only one not covered by the combined news media ... is the most important one of all, the mission control center at Houston.
“It is not a secret place, not one in which unnecessary traffic is discouraged. . . .
“But neither camera nor tape recorder nor pen-and-paper reporter is allowed in the nonsecret room at any time during a flight. . . . This is not to suggest that there has been any coverup to date. In the course of missions, [Christopher] Kraft gives regular, full, and apparently frank accounts of flight activities and opens himself to detailed questioning. So do his associates. A mission commentary of less consistent accuracy and authenticity is broadcast.
“But whether or not there has been suppression to date is not the point. All flights so far have ended happily, and nothing succeeds like success. There has been no reason for a coverup.
“The point is that the opportunity for news management definitely exists in mission control—and it is an axiom of political science that where opportunity exists, there are always people waiting to seize it.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 9/1/65)

September 2: Commenting on American contributions to space science,
N.	M. Sissakian, Soviet biochemist, wrote in Pravda: “Soviet scientists note with satisfaction the considerable contribution of American science to the study and opening up of cosmic space, which specifically manifested itself in a series of flights of cosmonauts in one-seater and two-seater ships. Most essential results were obtained by the American scientists from the flights of the ships Gemini 4 and Gemini 5. . . .
“. . . The flight of G. Cooper and C. Conrad was additional proof that the state of weightlessness during the minimum time required for a flight to the moon and back does not cause essential physiological changes in the human organisms and has no noticeable influence on his ability to work.
“Of great interest in the cosmic flight of man from the biological viewpoint is the study of such problems as the functional state of the cardiovascular system, the water-salt exchange, and the vestibular apparatus.
“Aboard the ship Gemini 5 a number of physiological experiments . . . were performed. The method tested on the Cosmonaut C. Conrad of inflated cuffs around the extremities, which were intended to maintain the necessary functional vigor of the cardiovascular system, merits attention. . . .
“The flight of Gemini 5 is a great success for U.S. scientists. The Soviet scientists sincerely congratulate Cosmonauts G. Cooper and C. Conrad on the successful conclusion of their flight, giving due credit to their courage and endurance. They transmit to the scientists and the entire personnel which prepared and carried out the flight their congratulations and wishes for further successes in the peaceful opening up of the cosmos.”	(Pravda, 9/2/65)

•	Refined data on Martian atmosphere’s density, ionization, and com-
position, based on analysis of radio signals from mariner iv during its occultation experiment, were reported by scientists at American Geophysical Union meeting held at Southern Methodist Univ., Dallas, Tex. Martian atmosphere was now thought to be much thinner than previously believed: it now seemed that air pressure at Martian surface was only about one-5,000th that of earth. Theory that Martian atmosphere was more dense at heights of 25 mi. or more above the surface than earth’s at comparable elevations was not upheld; observations reported today indicated Martian atmosphere was thinner than earth’s at all elevations. Temperature was about —250° at location of maximum ionization in Martian atmosphere (78-mi. altitude, about one-fourth the expected height). In earth’s ionosphere, temperature is higher than 2,200° F. Atmospheric composition that would account for the mariner iv observations, the scientists said, would be largely carbon dioxide. (Earth-based observations of Mars had shown the presence of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere.) Only scant amount of carbon dioxide is present in earth’s nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.

•	Paraglider, in its first successful manned free flight, demonstrated it
could guide a spacecraft to preselected landing site. Test pilot Donald
F.	McCusker landed a Gemini-type test craft at Edwards afb, following a four-and-one-half-minute flight suspended beneath the wing. He put the previously-inflated paraglider and simulated spacecraft through a series of turn and pitch maneuvers enroute to his landing, after being towed aloft by helicopter and dropped at approximate 8,000-ft. altitude.
In actual spacecraft recovery, the paraglider would be stored in a ten-cubic-foot canister onboard the spacecraft. After reentry when the vehicle would be slowed by the earth’s atmosphere and parachute drogue, the paraglider would be deployed to its full size—31 ft. long with a 31-ft. span—using an onboard nitrogen supply. The astronaut would control his glide through an onboard flight-control system.

September 3: Speculation that the earth might briefly have had another moon, one of pure iron which disintegrated and fell to earth in a series of fireball showers, was reported in Science. Discovery of a 47-mi.-long string of craters and meteorites extending northeast to southwest in northcentral Argentina led scientists to propose that the rare meteorites, consisting of almost pure iron, might be remnants of a single object which had orbited inside the Roche Limit, been torn apart by the gravity of the earth, and fallen from orbit. Perigee of the hypothetical orbit would have been over the latitude of Argentina and inclination would have been about 40° to account for the alignment of the nine craters. {Science, 9/3/65, 1055-1064)

•	Washington Post discussed the role of a manned orbiting laboratory
(mol) in arms control: “The primary mission of MOL, a canvass of Washington officials makes clear, is without a doubt to have man supplement the machine as a shutterbug spy in the sky. Hence man will advance the sensationally successful camera work of the unmanned Samos series of photo reconnaissance satellites now producing thousands of pictures of the Soviet Union and Communist China.
“Human judgment is the critical new factor being added by use of the MOL . . .
“Here is what the Air Force believes . . . men will be able to do:,
“They can use their judgment on what to photograph. They can be selective on when and where to aim not only one camera but a series of cameras including new and experimental photographic equipment. They can shoot accurately through a hole in clouds. And they can maintain and repair equipment that may have become inoperative. . . .
“How . . . will MOL contribute to arms control?
“The thesis is that the two major nuclear powers are deterred not only by the nuclear weapons they possess but by what each knows— and how fast it knows—about what goes on, in a military sense, in the other’s country. It is hoped that MOL will immensely add to that American capability in relation not only to the Soviet Union, but to China and, indeed, the whole world.
“Indeed, it is not inconceivable that these developments could lead to manned synchronous satellites, able to hover over Russia and the United States ready to flash instant word on missile firings, rocket tests, nuclear explosions, mass troop movements or other important military activities.
“The logic of this, from the arms controllers’ viewpoint, is that all this could lead to a formal worldwide inspection agreement—peacekeeping from space. But short of such agreement, such space surveil-
lance would vastly add to the deterrence on which today’s nuclear peace is founded.” (Simons and Roberts, Wash. Post, 9/5/65, Al, A5)
September 5: Significance of supersonic transport development was discussed in Nashville Tennessean: “Unless the United States goes ahead with the SST, domestic airlines will probably be forced to buy the supersonic Concorde being developed by Britain and France.
“The 1,450-mile-per-hour Concorde is due to be ready for service in 1971 while the present schedule would have a U.S. sst flying by 1974.
“Because the U.S. plane will be faster and carry 220 to 250 passengers as opposed to 118 to 132 for the Concorde, informed sources believe the 3-year lag will not be too damaging.
“Some visionaries say the SST will be out-dated before it ever realizes the potential forecast by its proponents.
“This school of thought suggests that 20 years from now, rocket-boosted passenger vehicles will hurl travelers across the seas at near orbital velocities, making cities on opposite sides of the earth less than an hour apart.
“But each new generation of commercial air transports has descended from military parentage. And today the military has no active program which would logically produce this speedy type of civilian travel.” (CR, 9/21/65, A5530-31)

together with Dr. Robert R. Gilruth, Director, nasa Manned Spacecraft Center, Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., NASA Associate Administrator, and Paul P. Haney, MSC Public Affairs Officer, held a news conference at MSC. Both astronauts recommended that in future flights both pilots sleep at the same time; more rehydratable foods be included in the diet; daily inflight exercises to compensate for muscular inactivity of the legs be included; the crew travel without spacesuits for greater comfort and flexibility; and that the training period be less compressed. Cooper and Conrad agreed that stowage had been the main problem throughout the flight. “Any small little item that was misplaced or wasn’t placed in the proper location seemed to multiply,” Cooper said. They had seen “a great many micrometeorites, and one meteorite when it was reentering the atmosphere down below us. And on any night side, during a very short interval of time, you could see micrometeorites reentering.”
Dr. Gilruth said he considered both astronauts “very potential candidates” for the first trip to the moon. (Transcript)

“The Pillsbury items scheduled by NASA for the Cooper-Conrad mission—each ready to eat and requiring no reconstitution—were brownies, gingerbread, pineapple fruitcake, date fruitcake, apricot cereal bars, strawberry cereal bars, toasted bread cubes and cinnamon toast.
“Cooper and Conrad were programed to eat 4 meals each day, providing a daily average of approximately 2,500 calories. The selected menu . . . was designed to maintain body weight at zero gravity under light physical activity. The 8 Pillsbury items were designed to provide a high energy source that supplemented the rehydratable foods in the menu for each meal. They required no preparation time and provided solid food consistency. . . .” {CR, 9/9/65, A5095)
•	William Hines commented on the economy of low bidding in an article
in the Washington Evening Star: “The lowest bidder still produces hardware for Uncle Sam’s space effort, and this arrangement does not always prove the most economical in either time or money. A glaring example has developed at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where America’s moonport is rapidly nearing completion.
“The lowest bidder has built two huge tank-like vehicles called ‘crawler-transporters’ there, at a saving of almost $3 million below a competitive bidder’s price. The only trouble is that the crawlers will not do the job they were designed for, which is to carry a Saturn V moon rocket on a mobile launching tower some three miles from an assembly building to where the rocket will actually blast.
“Trouble has been traced to some tapered roller bearings. . . .
“There seems to be nothing wrong with the bearings, which are produced by the biggest and best known manufacturer of such items. The fault apparently lies in incorrect design assumptions which result in overloads sometimes being imposed on the bearings, causing them to fail.
“Since the design—offered by the contractor, Marion Power Shovel Co.—was approved by NASA technical experts, the government will probably have to pay for the redesign necessary to make the crawler work. These redesign costs could well wipe out the difference between Marion’s bid and the higher proposal of Bucyrus-Erie, another large builder of heavy mobile equipment. . . .
“As it turns out, the false economy of low bidding in this instance may cause the United States to miss its stated goal in space: men on the moon in the ’60s. Entirely aside from whether this is a worthwhile goal, it is a national objective and the national prestige is riding on it. . . .” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 9/9/65)

“If you recall, since late 1957 there have been a number of hints that the advent of space exploration would create some new difficulties with our editorial style. First, there was the problem of deciding whether to italicize the Russian word ‘sputnik.’ Then we had to decide on the spelling and capitalization of ‘a-okay’ (or is it ‘A-OK’?).
“Unfortunately, we are now encountering some difficulties which would tax the abilities of Clifton Fadiman, himself. . . .
“Perhaps the most serious problem . . . stems apparently from an oversight on the part of our ancestors. In writing out the names of the nine planets of our solar system it became evident that we have neglected to formally name our own planet. At least this is the only conclusion one can come to when it’s noted that we capitalize the names of all the planets except our own. Webster, himself, insists on using a lower case ‘e’ for earth while dignifying tiny Mercury with a capital. Even the minor planets such as Eros carry formal names.
“The neglect is even more conspicuous in the instance of our own natural satellite. While the moons of other planets have exotic names such as Phobos we refer to ours in the generic and, consequently, with a lower case ‘m\

“President Johnson’s decision to allow the Air Force to build and launch five manned orbital laboratories (mol), at a cost of $1.5 billion or more, is likely to increase tensions between the US and the USSR and to spark a similar military space program by the Russians. If so, the Air Force will certainly urge further escalation of its own military space program, raising the specter that space will become a fantastically expensive battlefield of the future. . . .
“It is, however, possible that mol will demonstrate the feasibility of a few American and Soviet spacemen in their respective spacecraft operating a continuous space watch. If it does, and if both nations exercise restraint, it could have a stabilizing effect, as have our mutual unmanned reconnaissance satellites. If man can be an efficient ob; server in orbit for extended periods, the time may come when the U.S. should invite the United Nations to maintain a continuous space patrol, with a multi-national crew, to warn of any impending or surprise attack.” (Senter, The New Republic, 9/11/65, 9)

He explained: “Two major advances have made this possible in recent years. One is in technology—the satellites, reconnaissance planes, radars, computers and communication networks that have become the forecaster’s new set of tools.
“The other is in the use of the new knowledge provided by these tools to help the public deal more readily with the violent natural forces unleased by a hurricane. . . .

This milestone duplicated the period required for the manned lunar exploration mission.
“Gemini V also demonstrated the capability of man to withstand prolonged periods of weightlessness. The adaptability of the human body was indicated by the performance of the astronauts. For example, their heartbeat rates gradually dropped to a level significantly lower than their preflight normal rates, but by the fourth day, adapted to the weightless condition and leveled off. Upon return to Earth, the heartbeat rates were slightly higher than normal, as expected, but returned to normal rates during the second day.

•	Robert Hotz wrote in Aviation Week and Space Technology: “A strong
smell of sour grapes is beginning to emanate from the Soviet propaganda machine with its waspish comments on recent U.S. space achievements. . . .
“This . . . was evident in the Soviet propaganda barrage aimed at the Gemini 5 flight when it became apparent that Astronauts Cooper and Conrad would surpass the world space flight endurance record set by Soviet Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky in June 1963. Tass . . . charged that U.S. space officials were endangering the lives of the two Gemini Astronauts by keeping them in flight after the initial fuel cell problems in a supposedly rash effort to surpass the Soviet mark. Red Star, the official Defense Ministry newspaper, joined in by ‘exposing’ the Gemini 5 flight as a Pentagon plot to develop better space reconnaissance techniques and charged the peaceful scientific aims of space exploration were being subverted in Gemini by its military experiments. . . .
“What is really significant about these Soviet sour grapes is that they reflect a realization that the USSR has been overtaken and is being passed in the space race by the U.S. program. The U.S. superiority in unmanned space probes has become clearly recognized by the world with the Ranger lunar pictures and the Mars data from Mariner
4.	Gemini 4 and 5 finally erased the Soviet lead in the manned space flight. The solid operational foundation of the Gemini program has made possible the swift and sure pace which promises to eclipse significantly the Voskhod flights in the immediate future. . . .” (Hotz, Av. Wk., 9/13/65, 21)

“Moreover, by underlining the potential military significance of space, the President may have finally ended any last lingering hope that there might be a joint Soviet-American program for sending a man to the moon or to some more distant objective in the solar system.
“Most serious is the indication that the Soviet Union and its allies have interpreted the M.O.L. decision as the American signal for an arms race in space.
“. . . Would it not have been better for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to have been given the M.O.L. assignment
and thus avoid the provocation and propaganda setback represented by the decision the President actually took? And once a NASA M.O.L. were developed, it could be used by the military if the need arose. That need would presumably be evidence that the Russians or others were actively exploiting space for military purposes other than intelligence collection.” (Schwartz, NYT, 9/13/65)

“—the first Saturn V carrying a manned Apollo spacecraft is scheduled to be launched in 1968.
“—the manned lunar landing is scheduled to be accomplished prior to 1970.”
Following his presentation, von Braun told a news conference that “many Soviet and American scientists will participate to lay the foundation for extensive cooperation on the moon.” He said there were indications that the moon’s surface was solid enough to bear the weight of the spacecraft. Soft spots had been identified and would be avoided. He estimated that a landing on Mars would occur 15 yrs. after a successful lunar landing. (Text; NYT, 9/15/65, 24)
Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, outlined broad objectives of the Saturn-Apollo applications missions, earth-orbital and lunar:
“(1) Evaluate and extend man’s capabilities to operate in space effectively as an astronaut and as a scientist.
“(2) Conduct observations of the Earth, extra-terrestrial phenomena, and experiments dependent on the space environment.
“(3) Qualify systems and crews for subsequent long-duration space missions.
“ (4) To explore, map and survey the Moon.
Throughout these extended Apollo missions, the primary emphasis will be on science and applications experiments.
“The foundation for any long-range and broad national space program is a strong manned Earth-orbital program. For example, the approach to future manned planetary missions will depend not only on what is learned from unmanned missions such as Mariner and Voyager, but also what we can learn in Earth orbit about the effects on crew members of long-term confinement and reduced and/or intermittent artificial-gravity fields, as well as on the Earth-orbital qualification of extended-duration life support and power systems.

Michael Stoiko, technical director of Martin Co.’s Gemini advance design section, suggested to the IAF congress that an international space rescue service to aid astronauts stranded in orbit be devised. The U.S. and Russia would organize the service with availa-

Stoiko said the Martin Co. estimated 280 manned spaceflights would be flown by various nations in the next 20 yrs., with crews totaling 800 men. There was a “reasonable probability” that one or more U.S. crews would be stranded in orbit and a 62% probability that at least seven space ships with crews totaling 22 astronauts and cosmonauts would have to be rescued, (ap, N.Y.

Paper on “Research and Systems Requirements for a Lunar Scientific Laboratory” was presented at the iaf congress by C. William Henderson, nasa Office of Manned Space Flight, and Grady L. Mitcham of the Boeing Co.: “It is our obligation to define a meaningful lunar laboratory program which will extract the maximum scientific return for the investment of resources. Our scientific methods may have to change radically in order to achieve this goal of efficiency; perhaps by using the mantime on the moon only for the extraction of data, leaving the analysis of this information to the far less costly man power on earth. Most probably, leading scientists will not be, themselves, on the lunar surface, but rather will be at earth-based television consoles directing and guiding their counter-parts on the moon. . . .” (Text)
Soviet Cosmonaut Pavel Belyayev reported at the IAF congress that the exit of cosmonauts into space from orbital stations to relieve the crews and perform work in space would be made only through air locks,	making it	possible	to	avoid dehermetization of	the
spacecraft. Belyayev said visual acuity of astronauts was lessened by from 20-30% during spaceflight. Sensitivity of the eye to color was also affected. Drop of 50% occurred in the case of green and purple.
Cosmonaut Aleksey Leonov described in his report the functioning of the self-contained life-support system he wore in open space. He was able to regulate the atmosphere in his spacesuit, maintaining with- • in it	an excess	pressure	of	0.4 atmospheres or 0.27	at-
mospheres. When he stepped out of VOSKHOD II, Leonov said, the excess pressure in the spacesuit was 0.4 atmospheres and before reentry into the spacecraft, he said: “I once more set the pressure back to 0.27 atmospheres.” Data obtained, he summed up, permitted the conclusion that stepping out into open space does not cause serious specific changes in psychophysiological functions.
Of the future of the Soviet space program, he said: “In time there will be many space laboratories, with crews being periodically exchanged. Then there will be a spaceship for the moon, and a landing on the moon, followed by shots to other planets.” (ap, Wash. Post 9/17/65; ap, Bolt. Sun, 9/17/65; National Zeitung, 9/16/65, 3)
A voyage in a seven-man spacecraft, past Venus to land on Mars, was proposed by Robert L. Sohn of the Space Technology Laboratories in a paper at the 16th Congress of the International Astronautical Federation in Athens. Sohn said the flight could be conducted in the 1980’s using launching equipment and spacecraft already in development, including Saturn launch vehicles and modified Apollo spacecraft. He further claimed that the billion-mile, 400-day trip would cost about $20 billion. A 400,000-lb. craft would be assembled
in earth orbit after component parts were placed into orbit by four or five separate launches. (NYT, 9/14/65)
Soviet Professor Savenko reported to the congress about the study of primary cosmic rays by proton i, launched July 16, 1965. Volume of information radioed back to earth was 60 million units daily. Equipment was sensitive to particles of energy of “billions and more of electron volts which makes it possible for the station to explore the depth of matter.” Design of the ionization calorimeter in proton i permitted improved methods of research, Professor Savenko said. Information relayed from proton i processed so far showed that distribution of cosmic ray particles of very high energies differed from picture obtained by indirect measurements. (Tass, 9/17/65)

September 13: Reporting on the Lunar International Laboratory, under consideration by the International Astronautical Federation meeting in Athens, William Hines, in the Washington Evening Star, said the case for Lil had been outlined this way:
“1. A spaceship is horribly expensive; it costs $15,000 now to boost one pound of instruments to the moon, and will cost $180,000 a man hour to sustain scientists in space in the 1970s.
“2. The precedent exists for international scientific efforts: nuclear physicists already are discussing a trillion-volt atom smasher of which the world needs only one.
“3. The concept of international science has been accepted by the United Nations since 1946. . . .
“4. While the Russians have not taken an official stand, Sedov and others last year openly discussed Soviet studies on moon construction.
“[C. Stark] Draper [Director of MIT Instrumentation Laboratory] ... has called for a computer center on the moon to collect data there and pass it on to earthly campuses and laboratories with information literally unavailable here. The Lil program has not yet reached the cost effectiveness and design stages yet, but at the rate the Apollo program to land men on the moon by 1970 is going, backers say only 10 to 20 years is needed. A curbstone opinion is that $20 billion to $30 billion . . . comparable to the Apollo costs—would handle the construction and start of Lil operations.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 9/13/65, A8)
September 14: In a White House ceremony, President Johnson conferred Exceptional Service Medals on GEMINI V Astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, Jr., and Dr. Charles Berry, chief surgeon for the astronauts. The President announced that military promotions for the astronauts would be submitted to the Senate immediately. (Richard, Wash. Post, 9/15/65, A3)
Following the ceremony, Vice President Hubert Humphrey accompanied the astronauts, their families, and Dr. Berry to the National Academy of Sciences. Humphrey told the Academy: “The achieve-
ments of our astronauts are not just the achievements of two men. They are the achievements of family, country and of a society. . . .
“This is the best example of cooperation between Government and industry, between public and private, that I know in this nation, and might I add, that it is an example that should be emulated by many others in many other endeavors in this country.
“But our space program ... is more than national. It would be well enough if it were only national, but it is more than that. It is truly international. And I want ... to stress our space program’s potential as an arm of our foreign policy, of our international relations, and particularly of our peace policy, because this Government has but one objective in the world: a just, honorable and enduring peace. . . .”
Astronaut Cooper summarized some of the things that man could do in space:
“. . . we again showed that man can do a great deal of geological observations while in space. ... I think it is very significant that although you pass across some [geological formations] rather rapidly you still are able to . . . observe them and you are very capable of photographing them in great detail.
“. . . man is very capable of doing oceanographic observations. We have noted that you can detect a great deal of detail as to the depths of water, as to the currents of running water, and even to wind patterns that run on the waters, the wave patterns caused by the wind.
“. . . man could do a great deal of weather observations, both in real time and photographically. And we . . . were able to pinpoint one tropical storm in between some of the planned observations, and apparently that was very accurate pinpointing of its position.
“We determined in our discussions later with the Weather Bureau people, that for future use ... we could get much greater accuracy even on pinpointing these by the use of our platform combination and taking angles to a great deal more accuracy, rather than just estimations of the angular distance and locations.
“We found that you could do a great deal of visual observations of the phenomena around the earth ... we picked up ship wakes, several hundred miles away of . . . the contrast of the white wake against the blue background in very clear weather areas. . . .”
Conrad revealed that photographs taken during the Gemini v mission at the request of the Mexican government, had located volcanoes in Mexico that “the Mexicans didn’t know they had. . . .” He also said: “I think a system that has been left out and nobody has talked about is our environmental control system, which performed in a most outstanding manner for eight days. We had probably the nicest, freshest air that anybody could want to breathe, and we had an unusual first in the space business: most environmental control systems had been loaded down and pilot after pilot came back and said they were too warm, and we fought and fought it, and at McDonnell, to have a little change made because of some of the problems of heat exchange between the inlet and outlet pipes. It turned out that we were too cold.
“With two tubes running, we were probably the first ones to shut the cabin heat exchanger down and run everything as hot as we could get it in there. We were just right. And the thing that most surprised us on opening the hatch on landing, we couldn’t tell the difference between inside and out, and that is a monumental job for that small system.”
Dr. Berry concluded the program by presenting a review of the medical data received from the gemini v mission.
The astronauts’ party then proceeded to the Capitol where Vice President Humphrey presented them to the Senate and then to the House. Cooper told the House: “We set out with our prime objective on Gemini 5 to fly 8 days. We were to fly this 8 days primarily to show that man, with all the various equipment on board, and the machines, could safely and very functionally do this 8-day mission with no adverse effects. We were entirely successful in this. . . .” Conrad explained: “Gemini 5 was a significant advance in the whole program in that we flew the first all-out spacecraft. We would not have been able to go without the fuel cells for 8 days. This was the first time they were flown. We had the first radars from which we got some very excellent data to enable the GT-6 to continue with their present rendezvous plans. It was the first time that the cryogenic storage of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen had been run that long in space. . . .”
Dr. Berry told the Senate: “We are conducting a program such as this [Gemini program] ... to make man a vital part of such a research effort and to show the facility that man has to gain scientific information using vehicles such as we are able to build in this country. . . .
“I think I can report, so far as information has been obtained in this country to date and at the moment, that we are the only ones who have that sort of information for the duration of which we are speaking. We can confidently say that man has been able to perform very well up to 4 days in a weightless state earlier, and on this mission 8 days in a weightless state. He has then been able to re-adapt back to a 1-G environment. We have living proof of that.” (Texts; CR, 9/14/65, 22924-22927; nas-nrc News Report, 9/65, 1-2)

Finally Bergman phoned Julian Scheer, the NASA publicity man who was traveling with the astronauts. When would the Americans show?
“Why they would not appear at all, said Scheer. He said no one had cleared such a meeting with him . . . The Russians were angry
and left the scene in a huff, and at a news conference later, Sedov made no secfet of the fact that they considered the incident a snub and an affront.
“An air of mistrust now prevailed. There was, as Pete Conrad observed later, ‘some real bad feeling around this place.’
“Scheer, trying to right things, sent a letter to Dr. William Pickering, president of the International Astronautical Federation, urging that the astronauts be brought together. . . .

But short of those moments, travel in space near the earth is beginning to be routine.” (Balt. Sun, 9/17/65)
•	Decision to proceed with the Mol received comment in Science: “Some
proponents of MOL believe that, as insurance against ‘technological surprise’ and as a test of improved methods of intelligence gathering, the project will lead to greater stability in relations between the United States and the Communist world. But skeptics fear that MOL will carry the arms race into space. Despite a long hunger, the Air Force has never before been permitted a role in manned space flight, a function heretofore reserved exclusively for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.” (Science, 9/17/65, 1357)

September 19: Progress report in Pravda on ZOND III: “Soviet automatic space station Zond 3 launched July 18, 1965, continued its orbital flight gradually moving farther away from the sun. On September 15, the space station was 12.5 million kilometers away from the earth. During this period 75 radio-communication sessions were held with the station. During these sessions, photos of the far side of the moon, comprehensive telemetric data on the physical processes in interplanetary space, and data on the station’s instruments and systems were transmitted to earth. To check the systems that make it possible to change flight direction, the flight trajectory of Zond 3 was successfully corrected on September 16 for experimental purposes. The as-troorientation system, which automatically orients on the sun and the star Canopus, turned the station into the specific position commanded from the earth and has maintained this orientation with great accuracy. Then the correcting engine was switched on and changed the flight speed of the station 50 meters per second at an angle of 45° with respect to the direction to the earth. Radio control sessions with the station confirmed that the correction maneuver had been executed correctly. They also showed that the station’s systems continue to function normally.
“The space station relayed to the earth comprehensive data on the interplanetary magnetic field, cosmic radio emission, interplanetary ionized plasma, longwave cosmic radio emission, and micrometeorite particles. . . . During the flight around the moon, data were also obtained on the spectrum of its infrared and ultraviolet radiation.” (Tass, 9/18/65; Pravda, 9/19/65, 2)

•	Announcement by Soviet Cosmonaut Aleksey Leonov at the 16th Inter-
national Astronautical Congress in Athens that the U.S.S.R. planned to orbit a permanent manned space station as the next major project in its space program received editorial comment in the Philadelphia Inquirer: “To be sure, Cosmonaut Leonov adds that after ‘many space laboratories’ have been established, ‘with crews being periodically changed,’ his country expects to give attention to ‘a spaceship for the moon, and a landing on the moon.’ It has been understood all along, of course, that
this was the method Russia would use in sending men to the moon. The emphasis on many permanent manned space stations orbiting close to earth, however, shows all too plainly that the real concern of the generals running the Communist space program is in the military advantages that lie in control of the space immediately beyond the atmosphere and over the heads of free nations around the world.” (Phil. Inq., 9/19/65)
September 19: According to Dr. Colin Pittendrigh, Dean of the Graduate School and biology professor at Princeton Univ., mariner iv photographs of Mars did not provide any new evidence that life could not exist on that planet. Even though Mars appeared virtually waterless in the photographs, he pointed out, the area photographed was only a small fraction of the planet’s total area. “A scan across our Atlantic Ocean might lead some to say there is no land on earth.” (ap, Miami Her., 9/19/65)

Because of their similarity, we have in the ocean a readily available laboratory environment. In it we can investigate the more significant problems common to both. . . .” One parallel is the changed pressure of the environment: for the aquanaut, pressure problems involve return from extremely heavy pressure to normal pressure at earth’s surface; for the astronaut, pressure problems involve functioning in lower pressure of spacecraft and vacuum of space itself. Other shared biomedical problems: dysbarism, oxygen toxicity, trace contamination, and anoxia. (Macomber, CNS, San Diego Union, 9/19/65)

They have to rendezvous. They have to engage in docking. They haven’t had enough time experience yet of men in space to really say what they can do on a permanent platform . . .” (SBD, 9/20/65, 88)
•	U.S. policy decision to conduct space operations in an atmosphere of
maximum public exposure received editorial comment from Robert Hotz in Aviation Week and Space Technology: “The course of space technology has proved the U.S. policy to be far more effective than that of the Soviets. It has projected an international aura of leadership and achievement that has permitted the whole world to share in U.S. space projects, both scientifically and emotionally. It has also applied a steady and increasing pressure on the Soviets to abandon their super-secrecy. . . .
“There is little doubt that the leadership in space technology passed to the U.S. during the course of last summer. But who, outside a small internal bloc of techno-politicians, would have realized this under a blanket of supersecrecy?” (Hotz, Av. Wk., 9/20/65, 21)

September 21: In advance excerpts of his book, Waging Peace, 1956-1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower related his “reactions to Sputnik and the Gaither Report” in October and November 1957. President Eisenhower reviewed a meeting on October 8, 1957, with his principal military and scientific advisers. The late Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald A. Quarles reported: “There is no doubt that the Army Redstone could have orbited a satellite a year or more earlier. . . .” Quarles reviewed the reasons for the separation of the IGY Vanguard satellite from the ballistic missile programs, saying: “The Russians have done us a good turn, unintentionally, in establishing the concept of international space,” a principle confirmed by the orbiting of Sputnik over the air space of country after country. “Late that same morning,” President Eisenhower wrote, “I directed Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson to have the Army prepare its Redstone at once as a backup for the Navy Vanguard.”
Of sputnik ii, which orbited “Laika” on November 3, 1957, President Eisenhower said it did not arouse American public opinion because people “seemed to resent the sending a dog to certain death—a resentment that the Soviet propagandists tried to assuage a few days later by announcing that they had put poison in the last of Laika’s rations. . . .
“The public, however, became bewildered and upset when word got out that a far from optimistic secret report had been made to me in the National Security Council . . . called the Gaither Report.
“This was a period of anxiety. Sputnik had revealed the psychological vulnerability of our people. The Communists were steadily fomenting trouble and rattling sabers; our economy was sputtering somewhat, and the ceaseless and usually healthy self-criticism in which we of the United States indulge had brought a measure of self-doubt. Added to this was the failure of our first satellite launching attempt [Vanguard] in the full glare of publicity and the alleged missile ‘gaps’ which political observers claimed they had detected .. .
“The Soviet satellites,” President Eisenhower said, “were a genuine technological triumph, and this was exceeded by their propaganda value. To uninformed persons in the world, Soviet success in one area led to the belief that Soviet communism was surging ahead in all types of activity.” {Wash. Post, 9/21/65, Al, A19)

September 21: Rep. William S. Moorhead (D-Pa.) spoke on the floor of the House on the problem of collecting and using information for decision-making in government and industry: “Experts say that the human mind has difficulty in considering more than 10 or' 20 factors at the same time in making decisions. Yet, the unsolved problems of our society may require thousands or hundreds of thousands of factors or subfactors to be considered. Industry has learned to simulate mathematically a given environment. By varying the input assumptions or by varying subdecisions the decision maker can be given rational basis on which to make alternative decisions.” {CR, 9/21/65, 23755)

Schriever noted two examples of unmanned satellite systems: (1) the Nuclear Detection Program consisting of six Vela satellites gathering information on radiation backgrounds in far space and defining an operational nuclear detection system; and (2) communications satellites. He revealed that an initial r&d system to satisfy military communications’ requirements had been authorized by dod for launch early next year and would include up to 23 satellites orbiting earth at random spacing at about 21,000-mi. altitude. The satellites would be launched in clusters of eight from three Titan me boosters and then would be positioned along an orbital path. An advanced system was also planned in which expected life of each satellite would be increased from one and a half years to between three and five years.
In the advancement of space technology he listed several major programs: manned orbiting laboratory, space cabin experiments, development of cryogenic rocket engines, development of the scramjet, development of a spacecraft capable of maneuvering during reentry, and the Spacecraft Technology and Advanced Reentry Program (Start).

“The Gemini and Apollo-Saturn programs are providing this country with a broad base of technological, managerial, and resources capability which makes feasible a wide spectrum of space missions beyond the first lunar landings. This capability can be exploited in a wide range of earth orbital, lunar orbital, and lunar surface missions. . . .
“Over 90 percent of the Apollo program is directly applicable to our earth orbital capability. Many interesting ideas are under consideration on how to use this extended earth orbit capability to yield great benefits to mankind in his daily life on earth, and to conduct much significant scientific research.
“We are also studying the use of modified Apollo vehicles for missions both in orbit about the moon and for exploration of the moon’s surface. In lunar orbit, we can do mapping, surveying, and exploration of the moon. On the moon, we can conduct detailed exploration of the surface environment and the moon’s overall properties. We are also looking at the moon as a base for astronomical and for biological studies.
“All of these applications will capitalize on the presence of men in space. There is no substitute for having man’s abilities available right on the spot during a mission, with his human intellect to cope with the unexpected and operate in an unplanned or unprogramed manner. . . .” (Text, CR, 4/7/65, A5656-58)

•	Dr. Willard Libby, UCLA, recommended development of a nuclear space-
ship in his address before the Aerospace Instrumentation Symposium in Los Angeles: “The only possible way of reaching into the deep reaches of space is by accelerating to incredible speeds, speeds that go far beyond those which we have obtained so far in the space program, and it is completely clear that the only way of reaching these speeds is by using atomic energy.” Libby specifically recommended consideration of a reactor complex capable of supplying 10,000 megawatts of power to an engine with a designed thrust of 15,000-20,000 lbs. Such a spaceship would cost billions of dollars and be a decade in the building, but “with it we could expect literally to explore the Solar System,” Libby said. He noted that Project Orion—the use of atomic explosions to propel massive space platforms—might be useful for delivering freight to the moon, but the shock of the explosions would pose difficulties for manned spaceflight. He was pleased with the success of the Rover-Phoebus thermally-heated atomic engines and felt they might be used to propel ships and run a ferry service to a moon base. (Text)
In a press conference, Dr. Libby urged a program to put more science into space exploration because “the dominant factor so far in the manned space program has been the drive to establish good engineering technology.” He suggested: (1) NASA establish a six-man scientific task force to live and work for a year with training astronauts; (2) close cooperation between scientific research at outstanding universities, engineering efforts at aerospace industries, and NASA facilities; and (3) a mutually-happy “marriage” between space and education to attract and inspire students.

NASA Administrator, said: “Mine was the relatively easy task of putting together an organization. Yours has been the much more difficult task of making good the promises we held out, at times so naively, to the Congress and the people of this Nation and the world. But handling these heavy responsibilities cannot be the duty of just one man, or a small group of men at the top.
“This Agency’s success attests to the skill with which NASA employees have been and are carrying out their jobs. ... To all of you and to the thousands of NASA people working at their tasks at whatever location throughout this nation and the world, I am proud to say— well done! And I am confident that the hard won leadership position you have attained will be maintained throughout the years ahead.” (Text)

•	A projection of the U.S. space program was outlined by Dr. Ed-
ward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, at the Building Products Executives Conference in Washington, D.C.:
“1. After we have made initial landings on the moon, we will, if conditions warrant, make many other trips to explore the various parts of the lunar surface and possibly to establish one or more bases there.
“2. Not only will unmanned probes be sent throughout the solar system, but manned expeditions will visit the planets whenever that becomes scientifically promising and practicable.
“3. We will develop a family of useful manned earth-orbiting stations, growing from relatively small orbiting laboratories to large multi-manned permanent stations. Regular ferry service will transfer personnel and supplies to and from such spacecraft.
“4. Global communications via satellites will become a fact in the very near future and will be followed by direct broadcast of both voice and TV by satellite to home receivers throughout large sections of the world.
“5. Orbiting spacecraft will increase annually in numbers, in size, and in sophistication. Through such activity we will greatly increase our knowledge about the earth as well as about the heavens.
“6. We can expect a marriage of the major features of both aeronautics and astronautics . . . lifting bodies and winged spacecraft with maneuverable reentry ability will be launched into near and distant space by means of recoverable and re-usable launch vehicles. Drastic reduction in the mileage cost of space travel will result.
“7. Spaceports for the coming and going of spacecraft will be built in a number of parts of this country as well as elsewhere.
“8. Improved propulsion—faster, more powerful rockets using nuclear as well as chemical energy—will characterize space transportation. Planetary trips which today would take many months will be done in perhaps a week’s time or less, while carrying substantial payloads of passengers, equipment, and supplies. And,
“9. As competence in space increases ... we can expect to see greater economic progress and international cooperation. Then we can truly say that our space efforts have made major contributions to world peace. . . .” (Text)
October 7~8: About 700 engineers and scientists attended the Fourth X-15 Technical Conference at NASA Flight Research Center for a technical review of the nasa-usaf x-15 flight research program. Paul F. Bi-kle, director of frc, and John S. McCollum, director of New Programs and Research Projects, USAF Aeronautical Systems Div., said future plans for the x—15, not yet approved, included modification to carry experimental hypersonic ramjet engines and study of a new delta-wing configuration. Such changes would provide vital information for future hypersonic aircraft design. The x—15, which had completed more than 150 successful flights since June 1959, had more than doubled the limits of manned flight in winged vehicles. Speed had been increased from about 2,000 mph to more than 4,100 mph. Built for altitudes up to 250,000 ft., the plane had surpassed 300,000-ft. altitudes four times and had reached a maximum of 354,200 ft. (NASA Release 65-318; frc Release 20-65)
October 8: LUNA VII moon probe probably was destroyed in impact on the moon because the firing of the retrorockets was “only partially successful,” speculated Sir Bernard Lovell, director of Jodrell Bank Observatory. Sir Bernard said variations in the signals heard at Jodrell Bank showed luna vn’s retrorockets were fired at 4:58 p.m. EDT for six minutes. He estimated that luna VII, traveling about 2 mps., was slowed down by five-eighths of a mile a second during this firing. Signals began again at 5:20 p.m. and then stopped at 6:08 p.m.—the
precise time when Russia had said luna VII would reach the moon. There was no official word on the fate of the ton-and-a-half space probe, but Western experts believed the Soviets had failed in their third attempt to so ft! and on the moon, (uri, Wash.

•	House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on
NASA Oversight issued a report on investigation of Project Surveyor
October 8: Lunar Landing Research Vehicle flight by Joseph Walker at Edwards.
by Rep. Joseph E. Karth’s (D-Minn.) Space Science and Applications Subcommittee. Karth committee summarized the most serious reasons for Surveyor’s delay: 1) the failure to do adequate preliminary work; 2) a series of major modifications; 3) inadequate staffing by jPL in the first three years; 4) too rapid expansion of personnel at a later date; 5) poor management on the part of Hughes; 6) a resistance on the part of Hughes to making management changes; 7) an improperly conducted testing program by Hughes; 8) management weaknesses in NASA; and 9) a lack of vigorous centralized control by NASA.
To describe the magnitude of the Surveyor problems, the Congressional investigators highlighted a NASA press release of January 1961, which outlined Project Surveyor as costing about $50 million, consisting of seven spacecraft, each weighing 2,500 lbs., capable of placing over 200 lbs. of scientific payload on the lunar surface, with launches scheduled during the 1963-66 time period. The Subcommittee then noted that the first launch had been delayed about two and a half years, payload capability had been reduced to only a TV camera on the first four spacecraft and only 114 lbs. on the next three operational models, with total costs so far of nearly $350 million for the spacecraft R&D alone. The investigation concluded that the responsibility for the Surveyor situation could be found in the inadequate preparation for the project, the performance of JPL, the performance of Hughes Aircraft, and the performance of NASA Headquarters. “A serious mistake” was made at the very beginning of the Surveyor project when insufficient preliminary work was done to identify serious technical problems, judge feasibility, consider alternatives, and more accurately estimate costs. The investigation concluded further that this was “the inevitable result of a poorly defined project.” (House Rpt.)
October 8: Sweden, Norway, and Denmark were planning to establish a Nordic chain of detector stations to register underground atomic blasts. Sweden and Norway would each construct at least one detector station and join their stations; Denmark would build a large station in Greenland.

• Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, NASA Deputy Administrator, addressed sym-
posium on universities and Federal science policies held during meeting of National Academy of Sciences, in Seattle. He discussed the role of universities in space exploration and specified NASA-univer-sity relationships: (1) direct project support by means of research contracts to universities; (2) provision of new facilities, including those to encourage interdisciplinary groups for research in the interest of both the university and NASA; and (3) training support, including program to turn out 1,000 Ph.D.’s annually. He then turned to evolution of the university’s future role:
“It is not expected that the university will become the primary action agency for solving the economic and social problems of our society or for setting basic social objectives, but it must have a prominent voice and influence. The university should, I think, aspire to intellectual leadership, to observe and analyze, to apply the power of the human mind—that faculty which distinguishes man from animal, to establish a rational basis for policy and action. The direct attack must be undertaken by other institutions, mainly by political agencies. We are now witnessing the evolution of government agencies, particularly those of the Federal government^ to meet social needs by direct action in all fields from economics and public health to science and technology. A beginning is being made in the mobilization and integration of the total available resources to attack the most complex social problems. “. . i. I believe that . . . the traditional values of pursuit of excellence, freedom of inquiry, preservation of creativity, and the support of the unconventional new ideas, particularly those of young scientists, . . . may not only be preserved but may even be strengthened within the larger framework of increased scope which
can provide a sounder human motivation, bring allocation of increased resources, provide a satisfaction of great accomplishment in terms of human goals, and a sense of a community of interest with all mankind. If you will take the time to discover what is now going on in the exploration of space, you will find a free association of individuals, each with complete freedom of individual choice, in the largest and most challenging venture of man, the search for knowledge of his environment, and the application of this knowledge to his benefit. In this group of several hundred thousand people you will find innumerable examples of the pursuit of excellence from the renewed pride of the workman in his handicraft, to the intellectual effort of the scientist to analyze and observe. You will find mainly young men, unafraid of large problems or rapid change. You will find the unconventional idea being given attention. The university and the university scientist must and will adapt to the age of space exploration. . . .” (Text; Science, 11/26/65, 1129-33)

October 11-13: The aiaa’s Fourth Manned Space Flight Meeting was held in St. Louis.
William B. Taylor, Director of NASA Apollo Applications Office, outlined some long-range goals of Saturn/Apollo: “By 1980, it seems likely there will be a vigorous program for manned exploration of the near planets, probably based on a new generation of space vehicles capable of flights for durations of 2 to 3 years with crews consisting of 6 to 8 men. Although by 1980 it is not likely that men will have landed on Mars, it is possible that a Mars flyby or manned orbiting mission will be imminent if not already accomplished.
“On the moon by 1980, there may be in operation one or more multi-manned research observatories, conducting astronomical and geophysical operations on a year-round basis. These observatories may also be home base for mobile lunar explorations, using self-sufficient surface vehicles.
“In earth orbit by 1980 there may be one or more multi-manned, orbiting space stations, functioning as research laboratories for the advancement of human knowledge and increase of living standards. In addition to these permanent space stations, there could be a variety of smaller earth orbiting spacecraft, operated by private industry or government agencies in much the way aircraft operate today, to carry out such applications as long term weather forecasting and control; surveys of water resources, crops, forests and ocean currents; continuous, wide-band worldwide communications; air, sea and space navigation, and traffic control.
“These, then are some of the longer range objectives of the 1970’s and 1980’s which we feel can be achieved with the wide base of space
technology which can be developed in alternate missions using the Saturn/Apollo systems. . . .” (Text)
Undiscovered biological rhythms in man could prevent his visiting other planets, reported biologist Eugene Spangler, TRW Systems. “The consequences of the removal [of man from earth] are in many respects unknown. The solution may not come except by means of gradual accretions in the total time that man spends in space together with careful monitoring of his reactions as that time is increased. But it seems necessary to come to further grips with the problem insofar as possible before prolonged space flight is attempted. The goals must be first to define the problem in two steps: (1) what specific correlations exist between the life processes of man and the variations in his geophysical environment? and (2) what are the results of substantial alteration of that environment on these correlations?”
Spangler noted that all of the known human rhythmic cycles could be interrupted without apparent harm, yet even the adjustment to a rapid change of several time zones after a jet flight could involve unpleasant recycling of the body’s “biological clock.” (Text)
Suits of armor might be worn by astronauts on long lunar explorations, reported Richard S. Johnston, James V. Correale, and Matthew
I.	Radnofsky, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. The suits must be reliable, mobile, leak-resistant, and have lightweight construction and high durability for repeated wear. Two models of a metal spacesuit had met these requirements and been delivered to MSC for further testing, they said.
Spacesuits for the Apollo mission, which would involve relatively brief lunar walks, would be of fabric and consist of several layers, starting with water-cooled underwear, followed by pressure layers to hold the suit’s atmosphere, and finally an “overcoat” of fabric. (Text) Greater space cooperation between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. was predicted by Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper (L/Col., usaf) in a news conference. Cooper based his prediction on discussions he and fellow Gemini v Astronaut Charles Conrad, Jr. (Lcdr., usn), had had with Cosmonauts Col. Pavel I. Belyayev and L/Col. Aleksey A. Leonov at the International Astronautical Congress in Athens. Cooper said the cosmonauts were “mighty nice fellows” who “appeared to be very happy that we could get together and talk.” (Clark, NYT, 10/12/65, 9)	_ _
Dr. Alfred J. Eggers, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology, told the meeting that the nation as a whole should be ready to decide whether to send men to other planets. He expressed faith that the public would want to continue space exploration: “It is all part of man’s wanting to know what the hell he’s doing in his environment.
“The American people are just about what they claim they are—a people very fascinated with their environment, and when they can find another way to explore their environment they are very willing within reason to put their resources where their interest is.
“They will do that so long as they are getting return on their investment. But there has to be a payoff here. . . .” The “payoff” would not necessarily come before the mid-nineteen seventies’ plane-
tary decision, so the public would have to continue to have faith that the space program had such potential, Eggers said. (Clark, NYT, 10/14/65, 8)

October 12: At a background briefing at NASA Hq. on Advanced Chemical Propulsion, Adelbert 0. Tischler, Director, Chemical Propulsion Div., NASA Office of Advanced Research and Technology, revealed that NASA would probably be “confined to the Saturn IB and V for the next decade.” A maneuvering vehicle would be developed sometime around 1970 but would not be available for manned use until 1975. Tischler said that an ion propulsion system would never be applicable for deep manned space flight because of “its abhorrent thrust-to-weight ratio ... it is going to take a long time to accelerate the vehicle out of Earth orbit to arrive then later at the planetary orbit, and to decelerate in the planetary orbit, and vice versa. . . .”
Ion propulsion systems would be suitable for unmanned missions, however, because unmanned systems generally were small and ion systems were small; also, time was not a factor. In addition, they might be practicable as auxiliary devices for midcourse corrections 'on manned interplanetary trips.
After agreeing that present planning limited the application of nuclear systems to interplanetary trips, Tischler said: “There has been, during the last two years, a real marked decline of interest . . . about exploring Venus. I don’t think that is a correct viewpoint at all. I think there is a great deal ... to learn about Venus.
“We shouldn’t eliminate the possibility of some other planets. We could easily . . . visit the asteroid belt. There are some good-sized asteroids. Ceres is one of them. We could ultimately . . . land on the Moon of Jupiter with such a system. I doubt if we will undertake a landing on Jupiter until we know how to fight gravity. . . .
“All of these possibilities exist. In fact, I would even mention Mars has a couple of moons that we might use to land on in preference to Mars itself.” (Transcript)

October 13: Pre-Continent hi, 30-ton sphere in which six men lived and worked 330 ft. beneath the sea off the French Riviera for three weeks, surfaced after its inhabitants had erected and maintained a mock sea-bottom petroleum drilling rig without ever surfacing for air. The men would remain in the sphere until Oct. 16 when the atmospheric pressure in the capsule was expected to be low enough to permit emergence without danger. Object of this experiment, conceived by Jacques-Yves Cousteau, was to avoid need for frequent decompressions by placing workers’ dormitories on the ocean’s floor to allow more working time and less transition time per diver. Such a technique would permit man to mine minerals and cultivate underwater plants to ease the world’s food shortage problem, Cousteau said.

October 14: ogo ii Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (Ogo-C) was launched by NASA from Vandenberg afb with Thrust-Augmented Thor-Agena D booster. Because of a slight malfunction in the launch vehicle’s primary guidance system, orbit achieved had the following parameters: apogee, 939 mi. (1,511 km.); perigee, 250 mi. (403.1 km.); period, one hour 45 min.; inclination, 87°. Planned orbit had been somewhat lower: 575-mi. (925-km.) apogee, 207-mi. (333.3-km.) perigee, one-hour 37-min. period, and 86° inclination. Most of the 20 onboard experiments were not expected to be affected by the malfunction; OGO n’s solar panels and instrumented booms deployed as planned and the spacecraft achieved three-axis stabilization.
Second of the seven spacecraft programed for NASA’s Ogo program, OGO ii weighed 1,150 lb. and contained more than 100,000 parts, including a communications system capable of transmitting 64,000 bits per second in real time and 128,000 bits of information per second from tape playback. Its mission was to concentrate on near-earth space phenomena with emphasis on global mapping of the geomagnetic field, measurements of the neutral, ionic, and electronic composition of the earth’s atmosphere. Data would be correlated with solar ultraviolet and

• Writing about Surveyor lunar probe in the Washington Evening
Star, William Hines said: “Surveyor will give science a view of the moon that will be different not just in degree but in kind. A ‘soft’ landing, with the spacecraft braked by automatic rockets, should enable scientists to learn—rather than infer—much about the lunar surface.
“Even the first Surveyor . . . should tell a lot and this one will lack most of the cleverly designed scientific instruments of later probes. Equipped with television, the initial Surveyor may settle many points of contention over surface conditions . . .
“Assuming success with Surveyor 1, scientists are hoping that its findings won’t evoke a repetition of the short-sighted clamor for ‘economy’ that followed the successful flight of Ranger 7 in July 1964 . . . owing to the mistaken impression that when you’ve seen one moon picture you’ve seen them all.
“To suggest that photographic and physical evidence obtained by one Surveyor in one isolated spot could yield results characteristic of the whole moon is senseless. . . .
"Since the safety of asironauts reaching the moon a few years from now may well depend on the wise selection of their landing site, it would be advisable to get as much first-hand Surveyor-type data as possible and let the nation’s best qualified scientists study this information as thoroughly as they know how.” (Hines, Wash.

October 17: In an original report on communications satellites, Soviet Prof. M. Kaplanov said: “The transmitter on the Molniya 1 Comsat had a power of 40 watts, i.e. 10 times that of the Early Bird. In this regard, the Soviet scientists and engineers have solved the most complex technical problems in the development of a sputnik equipped with onboard antennas oriented on the Earth with a strong power system assuring a supply to the transmitter throughout the entire communication session.
“The development of a wideband space transmitter of 40 watts power operating continuously is an innovation in world technology. This distinguishing feature of the Molniya-1 Comsat permits a considerable simplification of the onground equipment and a great reduction in the cost of its construction and operation. Evidently the great complexity of servicing and the inadequate reliability of the [ComSatCorp] equipment compelled France, England and West Germany to organize the alternate operating of their ground receiving points of space communication. Each of these points operates only one week out of three, the second week it is in reserve, and the third is spent in repair work. We note that the Soviet onground facilities for space communication in Moscow and Vladivostok have been operating daily since the launching of the Molniya-1. This is quite important for a satellite communication system, since upon the operating cost there depends greatly its ability to compete with other means of communication.” (Izvestia, 10/17/16, 5, atss-t Trans.)

October 18—19: Scientific results of 15 scientific and technological experiments carried on gemini iii and iv were presented by the principal investigators during a symposium at the Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Experiments were in weather and terrain photography, bone demineralization, astronomy, communications, and radiation in the spacecraft.
Dr. George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator of nasa for Manned Space Flight, introducing the symposium, noted three important general conclusions to be drawn from the results. First, data on man himself indicates that astronauts can adapt to the space environment, giving great confidence that manned space flight effort can move according to pian without the necessity of introducing special requirements such as artificial gravity. Second, further substantiation of the Mercury program evidences that man can see things from space which are not programmed on instruments to see. Third, the outstanding quality of photographs of earth from space demonstrates the feasibility of a number of significant applications of manned space flight for improvement of life here on earth, (nasa Release 65-321; nasa Rpt. of Symposium)

October 19: Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, afsc Commander, told a National Space Club luncheon that he had met with nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller and had reached a formal agreement on cooperation in R&D, including Mol experiments. Discussions were also underway, he said, for joint use of NASA and DOD global range facilities—tracking station, communications, and other supporting units—in the Apollo and Mol programs.
“Now we are in the beginning stages of two new ventures, the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) and the c-5a large transport aircraft. . . .
“Both the mol and the c—5a have great potential significance for our continuing national security. They also promise to yield a number of ‘fallout benefits’ of a scientific or economic nature. The knowledge gained from the mol program, in addition to its possible defense applications, should also prove very useful for future manned scientific ventures into space. The C-5a transport not only will greatly increase our ability to respond to military crisis situations and other emergencies such as earthquakes or floods in remote areas, but also may prove quite attractive to the commercial airlines. . . .”
General Schriever said he felt a follow-on to the b-52 was needed; that an Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft (Amsa) would have considerably longer range than a contemplated B-lll and would be superior; and that a maneuverable ferry vehicle for supplying Mol could very well come out of the Start program.

•	Evaluation of the Soviet space effort should be done in terms of Russian
rather than U.S. requirements and considerations, suggested William Hines in the Washington Evening Star: “To look at things from the Russian angle for a change may provide a new view of the whole space race.” Hines suggested that the orbits of the Molniya satellites were egg-shaped because with 12-hr. periodicity “the Molniya-type satellite stays over the homeland about two-thirds of the time and comes back at exactly the same time each day.” He said that the U.S.S.R. probably had no weather satellites “because it does not need this branch of the weatherman’s art.” A possible reason that there were no polar-orbiting Soviet photographic reconnaissance satellites like the U.S.’s Samos was that they were not needed. No Saturn V-type launch vehicle development was evident, Hines concluded, possibly because “Russia’s approach to [lunar landing] is not necessarily ... the same as America’s. ... A revealing hint along this line is contained in a recent issue of Moscow News. . . . The author puts forward the
suggestion that a lunar landing and return mission might be organized using two spacecraft rather than one, each of which could be launched by a rocket smaller than Saturn V.” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 10/21/65, A14)

Between 1945 and 1962 Government-financed R&D produced more than 40,000 patentable inventions. Nearly one-third were patented in the 4-year period ending in 1962. The great bulk of these inventions were made by private contractors whose research efforts were supported by the Federal Government.
“Each day the problem—judged in quantitative terms—is becoming more serious. Let me give an illustration. In January 1963 . . . nasa . . . reported that its work, conducted both in Government laboratories and private facilities, had led to 786 inventions.

•	Address by James G. Allen of the Univ. of Colorado before the American
Astronautical Society on the impact of space exploration was inserted in the Congressional Record by Sen. Peter H. Dominick (R-Colo.) : “The space revolution of the mid-20th century must be regarded as the most significant of all those great revolutions of history which have affected the fate of man. By definition, a revolution does produce a series of pyramiding effects, one building up on another. But, in the last analysis, these effects focus upon, and culminate in, truly significant changes in the social and economic relationships which shape one society.
“The space revolution of the mid-twentieth century thus is unique, as its course and direction will affect every individual on each of the five continents. Moreover, its effects will lie in an entirely new dimension—beyond the physical realm of man’s earthly existence and into the boundless areas of space itself. The space revolution of our day has resulted from the theories, hypotheses and observations of the scientists as their conclusions were tested and applied by the eingineers and technicians.” {CR, 10/22/65, 27886-88)
•	Editorial by Henry Eyring, Univ. of Utah, in Science: “. . . The crash
program on the atomic bomb grew out of groundless fears that our antagonists would get the atomic bomb first. The vast sums being spent at present on a crash program for an early landing on the moon have their own somewhat obscure, psychological basis. If the moon program is really the most effective means of staving off all-out war, expensive as it is, it is still a bargain. On the other hand, the attempts which are sometimes made to sell the moon program on its scientific merits alone, in competition with other scientific uses of the money, are less convincing. The charitable conclusion is that in public affairs it is deemed necessary to oversimplify actual objectives so that the general public will best serve its own interests for the wrong reasons. This oversolicitude is probably neither necessary nor desirable. . . .” {Science, 10/22/65, 439)
October 23: Dr. Charles A. Berry, chief physician for the astronauts, said in an interview with the New York Times that spaceflights had caused subtle, temporary changes in the human body that must be watched
with care for possible importance to longer future flights. Measurements of the apparent density of heel and finger bones of the GEMINI IV astronauts, who flew for four days, and the GEMINI v astronauts, after an eight-day flight, had indicated that calcium was being lost, or at least shifted to some other part of the body. “We have really found no gross changes,” he said. “In my opinion, we are going to see the body adapt to space flight. You are never going to have the guy’s bones turn to jelly so that when he stands on his leg it just goes ‘pfft.’ ” (Clark, NYT, 10/23/65, 58)
October 24: OGO II, NASA geophysical observatory satellite launched Oct. 14 at Western Test Range, ceased normal operation about 24 hrs. after its attitude control system gas supply was depleted. Gas depletion was associated with automatic maneuvers to restabilize OGO II because one or more of its horizon scanners tracked temperature gradients (possibly cold clouds) near the earth’s surface rather than the horizon itself. Although NASA considered the mission a failure, OGO II had provided valuable data from 19 of its 20 onboard experiments, (nasa Release 65-368; nasa Proj. Off.)

We told him: Thank you but we do not intend to visit your launching site. We do not intend to go because we know all too well that all space devices are as a rule launched into space with the aid of military rockets. You do it this way and we do it that way. While military rockets are used for these purposes we are unable to show you our Soviet rockets because we know all too well that our rockets were, are, and we are convinced, will be the most powerful, with the greater distance and load capacity.

October 25: Gemini vi, scheduled to be launched from Eastern Test Range, with Astronauts Walter M. Schirra (Capt., usn) and Thomas P. Stafford (Maj., usaf), was canceled by failure of the Agena rocket, vehicle with which Gemini spacecraft was to rendezvous and dock. The mission was to have been the fourth manned flight and the first rendezvous and docking mission in the Gemini program. Simultaneous countdown of both the Titan n-Gemini 6 and the Atlas-Agena had been developed to maximize launch reliability for a “same day” launch.
Atlas-Agena liftoff was at 10:00:04 est. The Agena Target Vehicle separated from the Atlas at 10:05:12 with all sequences and parameters nominal at separation. Following a nominal Agena coast period, loss of Agena telemetry and radar beacon track occurred at 10:06:20 after initiation of primary propulsion system burn. Attempt to establish
radar or telemetry track by the Canary Islands tracking station and subsequently by the Carnarvon station was unsuccessful. A hold was called at t-42 in the Gemini 6 countdown to determine the status of the Agena Target Vehicle.

Administrator James E. Webb said: “This is to report to you that the Titan ii booster which we expected to use on October 25 to launch Gemini 6, carrying astronauts Schirra and Stafford, is now being removed from the launching pad. We have examined carefully the question of whether this booster could be used for the launching of Gemini 7 into a 14-day orbit, and our studies show that the Titan booster which we have especially prepared for Gemini 7 is more suitable. This is the reason for the change from the booster now on the pad to the one especially designed for the Gemini 7 launch.
“Also, we have examined a number of ways to speed up the accumulation of the information which the Gemini 6 rendezvous flight was designed to give us. We find that it may be possible to take advantage of the work we have already done in mating the Gemini 6 to its booster and to the launching facility and thus save considerable time in its re-erection. If we can launch Gemini 7 without serious damage to the launching pad, there is some possibility that we could immediately re-erect the Gemini 6 spacecraft and booster and launch it in time to rendezvous with Gemini 7 before the 14-day flight comes to an end.” (Text; Pres.

October 28: Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, said in an address to the American Ordnance Association: “. . . In the case of the most recently announced space project, the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, we again have an example of a highly valuable exchange of technology and experience by two operating agencies of the Government. In this instance, NASA’s considerable success in manned space flight and in the development of spacecraft will assist the Air Force substantially in carrying out the Manned Orbiting Laboratory project. Such interagency cooperation will tend to improve rather than impair the peaceful image which this country has established.
“Since I have mentioned the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, it is worth pausing right now to challenge forthrightly those who have asserted or intimated that it has something to do with a weapons race. We expect misinterpretations of that sort to come from unfriendly countries and sometimes from ignorant domestic critics. However, I was disappointed to find that a few otherwise well informed publications and invididuals have asserted that the MOL is a weapons carrier and a project contrary to our peaceful progress in space.
“I assert as positively as I can that the MOL is not a weapons system, is not a means by which aggressive actions can be perpetrated, and is in no way in conflict with the established peaceful policies, objectives, or methods of the United States. Rather, it is a program that will increase our knowledge of man’s usefulness in space and will relate that ability to our national defense.” (Text)

visible from that site, had detected from 400-1,000 celestial objects cooler than 1,500° F, reported Dr. Bruce T. Ulrich of Cal Tech at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Chicago. Since between 70% and 80% of them lay along the Milky Way, it was theorized that they were “very large—probably thousands of times larger than the sun, very distant, and quite rare.”
The new telescope was novel in several ways: its concave mirror was of an epoxy plastic coated with aluminum; the mirror rocked back and forth at 20 cps, so that light from an infrared source in the sky would sweep across detectors of lead sulphide and silicon; the detectors, kept at —320° F, were sensitive enough to detect the slight increase in the infrared as the arm of the telescope swept past one of these objects.

“To date the purely scientific results from our manned space program have not been impressive. With good reason, the engineering and medical aspects have been given overriding priority. In effect, our manned space program has consisted of a series of great technological stunts. . . .
“Will the Space Agency be able to devise a continuing series of spectaculars of ascending dramatic quality? I think not. The first successful landing on the moon will be a climax. Just as succeeding climbs of Mt. Everest, after the first ascent, have drawn diminishing attention, later lunar travel will lose its novelty.

New scientific information is now available on regions of the solar system never before penetrated with instruments. Observations from the vicinity of Mars suggest entirely new concepts about the nature of that planet. Spacecraft performance has shown our ability to design and construct a remotely operated device of astonishing complexity. Its continued operation establishes a standard of reliability seldom, if ever, attained. Even maintaining two-way communications over distances exceeding 100-million mi. remarkably demonstrates advances in communication technology which were not thought possible a decade ago.
“The design concepts underlying Mariner date back to 1959 when the Jet Propulsion Laboratory began the Vega program. In 1960, Vega was modified to become Ranger.

•	“It seems clear that preeminence in aeronautics and space in the future
will certainly demand a continuous evolvement of new technology,” Dr. Raymond L. Bisplinghoff, Special Assistant to the NASA Administrator, said in Air Force and Space Digest.
“The consequences of not having done our homework prior to undertaking a system development to meet an explicit requirement are overruns in cost and time. These costs in resources are often so high that the means must be found to evolve new technology in advance of requirements. One would conclude from this that the formulation of a responsible requirement demands an underlying body of technology.
“One of the most important purposes served by the creation of technologies is to provide options in the selection of new requirements or missions. The existence of several technical options is fundamental to sound planning. Because of the many important implications of space activities, policy planners will require that they be given options. It therefore seems desirable that the development of a new branch of technology be directed toward a related class of requirements or missions rather than a single requirement. . . .” (AF Mag., 10/65, 61-64)

During October: Dr. Walter Dornberger, Vice President for Research of Bell Aerosystems Co., former chief of German v—2 missile program, and father of the Dyna-Soar concept, was interviewed on the eve of his retirement from Bell by Claude Witze in Air Force and Space Digest. Witze said:“. . . [Although Dornberger is] the outstanding pioneer in the development of ballistic rockets, he feels strongly that we have erred in relying on this single vehicle, with its inherent limitations.” He quoted Dr. Dornberger:
“	. . our whole approach to space is no good, if we really want to
think of space as an operational area.
“ ‘We must use a completely different approach. We must get away from this launching from pads, which costs millions and billions of dollars, to the more conventional way of taking off from a runway.’ ”
Witze continued: “He predicts that after we have gone to the moon we will start over again. Project Apollo cannot be turned back, he says, but the next time ‘we must create an environment in space that can be used by men, not only for research but for commercial and military purposes.’
“This environment he is talking about is a permanent space station, one that will never come back into the atmosphere. This will require a logistics system—a recoverable, reusable space transporter to carry people and supplies back and forth to space. The Dyna-Soar was a crude but necessary step in this direction, replaced today by the concept of the aerospace plane. . . .
“The Dornberger thesis is that a manned station in near space is as practical as a military base on Okinawa, a laboratory at the South Pole, or an aircraft parts and maintenance depot in Chateauroux. Once established, all that is needed is a logistics system to keep it going. From such a space station, expeditions can be sent to the moon, or many other places in space, with engines that give a thrust of only 20,000 pounds, instead of the millions of pounds required on one-way booster trips. . . .”
Quoting Dr. Dornberger: “ ‘It took mankind hundreds of years to learn to use the sea, but only fifty years to use the air. Space can be used in twenty-five years, if we get started. I doubt that the use of space vehicles will be more hazardous than the use of submarines.’ ” (AF Mag., 10/65, 80-88)

November 1: The rendezvous of Geminis 6 and 7 had been scheduled tentatively for the eighth day of Gemini 7’s 14-day endurance flight, revealed Command Pilot Frank Borman (L/Col., usaf) at a news conference held by Gemini vu’s prime and backup astronaut crews at MSC. Gemini 7 would act as a passive target vehicle, but would expend fuel to circularize its 108-mi.-perigee orbit to 161-mi.-perigee orbit and to maneuver into range of Gemini 6’s radar, if necessary. Borman said there would be no Eva on Gemini vn because the crew would be wearing new lightweight spacesuits unsuitable for work in the vacuum of space; he was unaware of any plans for Eva on Gemini vi. During ten days of the mission, the Gemini vn crew would fly in USAF-issue longjohn underwear.

•	The 1965 International Space Electronics Symposium was held in Miami
Beach. Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary, National Aeronautics and Space Council, told the Symposium that electronics would continue to play a prime role in the U.S. space program. Emphasizing the difficulty and complexity of the electronic problems which would be encountered in manned planetary exploration, Dr. Welsh noted that for manned Mars travel “we’ll need reliability for at least 400 days contrasted with more immediate goals of 14 to 30 days; we’ll need electrical ‘on board’ power measured in kilowatts instead of today’s tens of watts; we’ll need the data rates of 5 million bits per second instead of the current capability of 8 bits per second; and there is a still debatable possibility that we will need laser beam pointing accuracy several magnitudes better than what we now have. In components, we shall require new or improved concepts such as self-healing, self-checking, and accurate failure prediction to give the greatly increased reliability required. . . .” (Text)
Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, told the Future Space Programs panel that the use of satellites for scientific research and the development of practical applications in meteorology, communications, navigation, and geodesy were important components of the total progress of the space program. He said science had been the prime beneficiary of skills developed for using satellites and space probes as scientific tools: “The vitality of space science has been its close association with various disciplines of science, and its ability to offer those disciplines new ways of solving old problems, while at the same time opening up new horizons.” (Text)

November 4: Data obtained by the Pegasus meteoroid-detection satellite program and estimates by Dr. Fred L. Whipple, Smithsonian Astro-physical and Harvard College Observatories, prompted Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, Director of msfc Research Projects laboratory and one of the scientists who had conceived the Pegasus program, to estimate that a Pegasus-sized sensor with a 1-mm. (40-mil) aluminum sheet would be perforated in earth orbit about 40 times annually and a sensor with a 2-mm. aluminum sheet only one to three times annually.
Dr. Stuhlinger told the Northeast Electronics Research and Engineering Meeting in Boston of initial evaluation of the Pegasus data: in the smallest size meteoric particles, fewer particles were encountered than expected; in the largest, more were encountered than planned; and in the mid-range, actual results agreed closely with theoretical predictions. Dr. Stuhlinger reported on the Pegasus project from inception in 1962 through reduction of data as late as October 8, 1965. (msfc Release 65-275; Marshall Star, 11/17/65)

Oleg V. Penkovsky had contended that “several cosmonauts had lost their lives in spaceflight.” Sheldon said that statistically the U.S. was leading the U.S.S.R. in the number of successful satellite launches by a 2.3-to-l ratio, but that the Russians were leading in total weight of payloads launched and their lead had been increasing each year for the past five years. He noted, however, that “the true value of scientific findings made by each country is harder to measure statistically, and neither country has been wholly capable of objective judgment in this regard.” (Text)
•	NASA’s increased use of real-time planning in the Gemini program, in con-
trast to the “cast-in-concrete” planning of the Mercury program and the first Gemini flight, was praised by William Hines in the Washington Evening Star. He said this new elasticity had made possible the “revolutionary reprogramming” of the Gemini VI and Gemini VII missions where “quick and drastic re-thinking of almost every aspect of space flight operations was required. Also required was the junking of a great many shibboleths, not the least important being the fixed opinion long weeks of launching-pad checkout must precede liftoff of a mancarrying rocket. . . .” (Hines, Wash. Eve. Star, 11/4/65, A12)
November 4: The impact of a meteorite might have begun life on earth, Dr. Brian Mason, U.S. National Museum, told the annual meeting of the Geochemical Society of America in Kansas City. Scientists had speculated that the presence of organic compounds—substances containing carbon and nitrogen—in meteorites indicated that life exists, or had once existed, elsewhere in the universe. Mason noted that such compounds could be made without life, but added: “I believe . . . they may be a forerunner of life. A falling meteorite may be the way life got started.” Mason said that most meteorites appeared to come from the asteroid belt which orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter. This belt might be a planet that never collected to become a single body, he suggested. Dr. Mason was conducting research on the chemical differences a man-earth environment had imposed on meteorites. (Houston Chron., 12/5/65)

November 5: Man might be able to change the orbit of asteroid Icarus and make it an orbiting earth station, suggested Soviet scientist K. Stan-yukovich in an interview published by Economichesky Gazetta. Icarus has almost a one-mile diameter and weighs over six billion tons; every 19 yrs. it passes within 4 million mi. of earth. “There is a great demand for a natural moon of Icarus’ size,” Stanyukovich said, where man could build scientific observatories and warehouses to store fuel for spaceships departing on interplanetary trips. He doubted that it could be captured on its next approach in 1968, but foresaw a possibility for 1987. (Burke, L. A. Times, 11/6/65)
• Five lunar and Martian experts applied geological methods to interpreting Mars and the moon at the Geological Society of America Symposium in Kansas City. They found similarities between Mars and the moon: both bodies were subjected to slow erosion from showers of micrometeoroids from space; there was no evidence of surface water on either. Dr. Robert P. Sharp, Caltech, said that Martian craters were three-and-one-half times more numerous than on the lunar maria, but not as numerous as on the moon’s uplands. He believed the planet had an extremely thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide, temperatures ranging from 35° C to —100° C and no liquid water. Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, U.S. Geological Survey, related experiments on earth with features on the moon in effort to explain why the moon was being eroded. A nuclear explosion in Nevada, for example, created a meteorcrater-like hole, resulting in hundreds of secondary impact craters. “I think the surface is a fluffy material, about one meter thick, resting on the floor of small craters,” he said. “The bulk of matter is moved by the impact of small micrometeoroids. Probably a good deal of the material is melted and the melt may fly off into space.” Bruce C. Murray, Caltech, said that physical observations by studying emissions and radiation showed the moon emits light and other wave lengths in the same way that “fine, loose powder does.” He believed the outer one-half millimeter is covered with dust. Infrared heat samplings showed variations indicating a heterogenous type of rock near the surface. Dr. E. C. T. Chao, U.S. Geological Survey, discussed tektites—small, dark, glass, button-shaped objects, which he believed had been formed by meteoric impact, presumably on the moon, and had splashed off to fall on earth. Harold Masursky, U.S. Geological Survey, showed a geological map of the moon with the ages of various areas in different colors. He said the Survey had mapped three million square miles in the potential landing areas on the equatorial belt. He found five different “episodes of movement” on the surface.

November 6: explorer xxix Geodetic Explorer satellite (Geos A) was successfully launched by nasa from etr by a Improved Thrust-Augmented Delta with a new enlarged second-stage fuel tank to provide longer engine burn. Because the guidance system did not shut down the second stage at the desired time, the achieved orbit had the following parameters: apogee, 1,412.4 mi. (2,274 km.); perigee, 695.6 mi.
November 6: explorer xxix launch with first NASA Improved Thrust-Augmented Delta
from Cape Kennedy.
(1,118.1 km.); period, 120 min.; inclination, 59°. Planned orbit had called for apogee of 920 mi.
The 385-lb, satellite, designed ar.d built by Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Laboratory, contained five geodetic instrumentation systems to provide simultaneous measurements necessary for a more precise model of the earth’s gravitational field and to map a world coordinate system relating points on or near the surface to the common center of the mass: (11 four flashing light beacons to be photographed against the background of stars to define the arc of orbit and angular data; (2) corner cube quartz reflectors to pinpoint the satellite's position by reflecting laser beams; (3) three radio transmitters for Doppler-shift determination of the precise orbit; (4) radio range transponder to hx the positions of the satellite and interrogating ground stations; and (5) range and range-rate transponder to determine the changing range and radial velocity of the satellite. Simultaneous operation of the five independent and diverse geodetic-tracking systems would permit cross-checking and evaluation of the different techniques and was expected to enhance the accuracy of each system. Other objectives of the Geos program were: (1) to map with a high degree of mathematical exactness the structure of the earth’s irregular gravitational field; and (2) to compare and 'correlate results from different instrumented techniques employed simultaneously so as to assure greater accuracy and reliability.
Critical to optimum use of the radio and optical beacons on EXPLORER XXIX was the gravity-gradlent attitude stabilization system to
keep the satellite antennas, laser reflectors, and optical beacons pointing earthward at all times. In two to three days the attitude control would be initiated, (nasa Release 65-333; nasa Proj. Off.; ap, NYT, 11/7/65, 10; upi, Wash. Post, 11/7/65, A16)

He noted that this was similar to what had happened to the great comet of 1882, adding: “That one was visible for some five months after its perihelion passage—closest to the sun— and the way the Ikeya-Seki comet is acting indicates it may also be visible for that long a time.” Ikeya-Seki’s perihelion passage had occurred Oct. 21.

•	Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey said in address before American
Nuclear Society-Atomic Industrial Forum in Washington, D.C.:
“If anyone doubts the impact that science and technology have had on society, in just the past 20 years, he need look only at the new industries employing many thousands of people which have come into existence during that time—industries based solely on the evolution of new products and services. These include—and I mention only a few —television, the computer, the jet engine and nuclear energy.
“Some of these industries have sprung from the application of a single invention or chain of scientific thoughts.
“During these past 20 years, too, we have seen in the United States the creation of a constructive partnership unknown in our previous history—a partnership of government, university, management, labor, science and citizen—a partnership devoted to maximum development of science and technology not for the narrow interest of any single group, but for the common good.
“To witness the space launchings at Cape Kennedy, as I have, is to see this partnership in action. . . .”
Turning to the peaceful uses of atomic energy, he said;
“As chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, I am particularly concerned with the atom’s work in space.
“In 1961 our first operating space radioisotopic power source was orbited. And in 1965 our first space reactor was operated in orbit.
“The atom will soon become a major power source for our space program—an auxiliary source for spacecraft and life support systems and a necessary source of propulsion for extended space exploration.
“I can, in fact, foresee the time when our space efforts will be able to
continue only through use of rocket and nuclear power units transported and assembled in space. . . .” (Text)

November 15-17: Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, told a panel at the American Nuclear Society-Atomic Industrial Forum in Washington, D.C.:
“. . . advancing our competence in nuclear technology is of critical importance to the future of the national space program. Nuclear power and nuclear propulsion are musts for the more complex and long duration missions of the future. . . .
“We all know that the nuclear going in space won’t be easy. . . . Yet I am confident that the technical problems are resolvable and the investments warranted. . . .” Dr. Welsh delivered a warning to “space planners” to stop sitting on nuclear propulsion concepts and to expedite development programs. “We must not wait for clear-cut space requirements for these nuclear systems before moving forthrightly with their development. If we wait for precise mission definitions the technology will not be available when it’s needed. Moreover, we can be sure that our Soviet competitors will take positive actions, whether we do or not. For this country to sit back on its technological haunches and let someone else, bolder and more imaginative, show us the way is unthinkable to me.” (Text)
November 15—18: The International Congress on Air Technology was held in Hot Springs, Ark. Dr. Robert M. White, Administrator, Environmental Science Services Administration (essa), U.S. Dept, of Commerce, referred to the developing World Weather Watch in his address: “The work . . . comprises two broad, continuous, and parallel streams of action. The first will be a process of introducing into the present international weather system already proven equipment, techniques,
and procedures. We hope that by 1971 ... we will have made three significant improvements in the international system. First, we hope to improve the ability of the system to observe the global atmosphere and to provide fuller data for weather forecasting. In part this improvement will rest on the Tiros Operational Satellite System . . . which the United States will launch into orbit next year. Second, we hope to extend the benefits of modern computer technology throughout the world—by utilizing the computer to prepare weather analyses and forecasts routinely for the entire globe. And third, we hope to develop an international communications network for the timely exchange of raw data and for the rapid dissemination of analyses and forecasts.” (Text)

Unopened collectors would be distributed by ARC to 12 guest experimenters in the U.S. and Europe for study of the nature of comets and of extraterrestrial material in general, (arc Release 65-26; nasa Rpt. srl)
•	U.S.S.R. launched venus iii unmanned space probe towards the planet
Venus. Tass said the technique for placing the 2,112-lb. spacecraft into heliocentric orbit was similar to that used in orbiting venus ii on Nov. 12. Trajectory was close to the one calculated. Purpose of both launches was “to augment the volume of scientific information and to obtain additional scientific data regarding Venus and outer space,” but venus iii contained equipment to carry out different scientific investigations from venus ii. All systems were functioning normally. venus ii and venus iii were expected to reach the vicinity of Venus about March 1.

•	NASA disclosed plans for the new Applications Technology Satellites (Ats)
that would appear to hover over a given spot on earth to check out communications, weather, scientific and engineering ideas. There would be five in all, with four in synchronous orbit at 22,300-mi. altitude. First Ats was scheduled for launch in 1966; two more would be launched in 1967; the last two in 1968. Primary aim of the Ats program would be to find out (1) what happens to satellites in synchronous orbit, and (2) what can be done by a satellite continuously above one area of the earth. Among experiments planned were color television transmission, the first attempt to “talk” among unmanned satellites and aircraft, and photographing cloud formation changes in one place over a long period of time, (nasa Release)
•	“We’ll be lucky if we have nuclear propulsion around 1980,” and electric
propulsion is still further down the line for sometime after 1985, according to Dr. John C. Evvard, Deputy Associate Director for research at nasa Lewis Research Center. Evvard gave his views on advanced propulsion systems at the sixth annual Space Technology Series sponsored by the Canaveral Section, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, at Brevard Engineering College, Patrick afb, Fla. A pioneer in electric propulsion and advanced nuclear rocket studies, Evvard believed such concepts should not be considered for Mars missions of under 100 flights per year. Only frequent flights would increase the need for higher specific impulse and would justify the expense, he said.
Meanwhile, he predicted, chemical rockets of less than 500 sec. specific impulse would lift men to Mars, not by direct ascent but through a succession of parking orbits and assembly of hardware in space. Evvard told the meeting that since May 13, 1964, at least nine tests on Kiwi, Nerva, and Phoebus nuclear reactors had proved out a thrust greater than 50,000 lbs., at a specific impulse in excess of 750 sec.

The Honorable Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, speaking at the White House Conference, said: “We live at a time when the whole world is being made over socially, economically, scientifically and even intellectually. Our era has witnessed such dramatic achievements as flight faster than sound, the splitting of the atom, miracle drugs, and manned satellites hurling through space. Rapid and turbulent changes in the scientific, economic, and social fields, almost too numerous to name, daily defy evaluation on the basis of prior standards and experience. Vistas of endless space have opened as man’s horizons have widened to encompass the universe. At a pace beyond dreaming the whole pattern of our existence is being reshaped. To ensure that these changes work for the benefit of mankind, law must be developed rapidly enough in the world community to cope with the problems they raise and to harness their potential for peaceful and productive ends.” (Text)

•	Unpublished study of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (oecd)—international, intergovernmental agency—to determine importance of military and space research for civilian technological advance was reported by the Washington Post to contain three key conclusions: (1) military and space research is a costly and inefficient way of spurring technological advance for the civilian economy; (2) although there is some direct civilian application of new products and techniques developed for the military, the amount is limited and is shrinking; (3) while a massive military-space program like that of the U.S. may indirectly stimulate innovation by civilians, some of the same results could probably be obtained more cheaply by direct government aid to nondefense research and development. The study implied there were better ways for Europe’s industry to catch up. The report also stated the U.S. and the Soviet Union were putting about the same effort into research, and Western Europe was not far behind. In terms of manpower involved, U.S. total was over 1 million; European, about 500,000; Soviet, 1.5 million. In international earnings of patents and licenses, the U.S. was ahead. (Nossiter, Wash.

•	Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, nasa Deputy Administrator since 1958, died
of cancer at age 67. He was a former Director of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, a former Associate Director of the National Bureau of Standards, and—for forty-five years—an ordained minister in the Methodist Church.
An internationally renowned scientist-engineer who once said he and the airplane grew up together, he was recognized for his leadership in the development of aeronautics and astronautics. He generally was regarded as the man who guided the United States into the space age. Dr. Dryden served the U.S. Government with distinction since 1918 in science and technology, as an administrator, and more recently as a skilled diplomat in negotiating international agreements for cooperative efforts in the peaceful exploration of space. The recipient of many awards and honors, Dr. Dryden was especially known for his scientific contributions to fluid mechanics and boundary-layer phenomena.
At Johnson City, Tex., President Johnson said that the death of Dr. Dryden “is a deep personal loss and a reason for national sorrow. . . . No soldier ever performed his duty with more bravery and no statesman ever charted new courses with more dedication than Hugh Dryden. Whenever the first American space man sets foot on
the moon or finds a new trail to a new star, he will know that Hugh Dryden was one of those who gave him knowledge and illumination.” From Great Falls, Mont., Vice President Humphrey, Chairman of the nasc, said: “The death of Dr. Hugh Dryden is a sad loss to all of us, and especially to those of us who have been guided by his wisdom, experience, and great common sense in planning the nation’s space program.
“We shall miss him sorely as we plot our course for the decade ahead. So much of what this nation has been able to do in aeronautics and space over the past 40 years we owe to the creative science and the confident, skillful leadership of this great public servant. I know of no finer example of modern man in all his versatility than Dr. Hugh Dryden, whose vision, courage, and lifetime of service have helped to lead the way into the Space Age. . . .”
nasa Administrator James E. Webb said: “Dr. Hugh L. Dryden was a man of his time—of the air age, of the nuclear age, of the space age, with all the implications of modern science and technology for the accomplishments of his time. He was also a man for all times because his courage in undertaking the conquest of air and space, his scientific, engineering, and administrative competence and his qualities of humanity and leadership mark him as one of the truly great men who have contributed over the years to these fields. He will be sorely missed in nasa, in the nation and, indeed, in many nations.”
Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, said: “The country has lost one of its greatest scientists and one of its most dedicated citizens. The country will have to continue with its space and aeronautics programs without him —but will not be able to carry on as well without his inspiring leadership and ability.” (Texts)

December 2: Physicist and author Dr. Ralph E. Lapp said at Central Connecticut State College that the space budget would decline from $5 billion to about $2 billion by 1970 unless new space projects were proposed and approved soon. He was pessimistic about the possibilities of finding worthwhile proposals among those now being considered by NASA and suggested that (1) Presidential science adviser Donald Hornig issue a report which would be “an accounting and a forecast” of the possibilities in space, and (2) the National Academy of Sciences poll its 700 members for their views on how Federal funds for research and development should be allocated for space and other projects. Lapp said “near-earth” projects such as manned earth stations offered some posibilities, but not enough to fill the gap which would soon appear in the aeronautics and space industry. (Garwood, Wash.

•	Need for creation of a “Buck Rogers rescue squad” with trained men
and equipment to give aid on short notice to spacemen stranded or stricken in orbit was discussed by William Hines in the Washington Evening Star. Hines said a persuasive case had been made by Michael Stoiko of the Martin Co.: “Stoiko estimated that in the next 20 years there will be about 280 manned space flights involving about 800 men. Half of each—men and flights—will be American, half Russian. Total flight time will be about 2.4 million man hours, compared with the world-wide total of about 1,200 man hours to date.”
Stoiko projected “a 62 percent probability of at least seven emergency situations involving 22 men in the next 20 years; a 58 percent probability of two or three emergencies in the coming decade.”
Hines said that now “astronauts stranded in orbit would have no hope of rescue and only a melancholy choice between two fatal alternatives: to sweat it out until the oxygen finally was gone, or to make a quick end of it by explosively decompressing both spacecraft and suit.” (Hines, Wash.

December 4-73; NASA’s GEMJNI Vll spacecraft, piloted by Astronauts Frank Borman (Maj., usaf), command pilot, and James A. Lovell, Jr. Lcdr., USN), pilot, was successfully launched from Eastern Test Range at 2:30 p.m. EST on 14-day mission—longest U.S. flight to date. It would be target vehicle in rendezvous with Gemini 6 spacecraft, scheduled for launch December 13. Titan It booster’s first stage burned 155 sec.: second stage separated and burned 182 sec. Traveling at 17,586 mph. gemini vn was inserted into elliptical
orbit with 203-mi. (327.4-km.) apogee; 100-mi. (161.2-km.) perigee; 89-min. period; and 28.9° inclination. Immediately after spacecraft separation, gemini vii turned blunt end forward and began stationkeeping on Titan ii’s second stage at distances from 20 ft. to 50 mi. for 17 min. Several hours later Borman made the first of a series of course corrections to position gemini vii for the scheduled rendezvous with Gemini vi by firing the thruster rockets 1% min. to raise the apogee from 100 mi. to 138 mi. Apparent loss of pressure in spacecraft’s fuel cells during flight’s early stages was later determined to be faulty indicator light.
On Dec. 5, the astronauts encountered difficulties at first in sighting the rectangular panels displayed near Laredo, Tex., but later they successfully identified the patterns of panels and provided evidence that their visual acuity was not degraded over the 14-aay period.
On Dec. 6, Lovell removed his 16-lb. spacesuit, becoming first U.S. astronaut to fly in undergarment. The astronauts visually tracked Polaris a-3 missile fired from uss Benjamin Franklin, submerged nuclear submarine off Cape Kennedy, and successfully tested onboard radar receiving unit needed for rendezvous.
On Dec. 7, Borman fired thruster rockets to achieve a higher orbit for rendezvous attempt: apogee, 197 mi. (301.7 km.); perigee, 145 mi. (233.8 km.).
On Dec. 8, clouds over New Mexico caused astronauts to cancel scheduled experiment to communicate with ground by laser beam.
On Dec. 9, Borman executed a posigrade maneuver to circularize GEMINI vii’s orbit, firing thruster rockets one minute 18 sec. to raise perigee to 185.8 mi. (299.7 km.); 43 min. later, he fired braking thrusters 15 sec. to lower apogee to 188.3 mi. (103.7 km.) and provide a proper target orbit for Gemini 6. Dr. Berry recommended that Borman apply ointment to ease the nasal dryness caused by the 100%-oxygen atmosphere of his spacesuit.
On Dec. 10, when temperatures in gemini vii’s cabin rose to 85°, Flight Director Christopher Kraft ordered Lovell to put on his space-suit to permit Borman to remove his. One astronaut was to wear his spacesuit at all times during the mission. Dr. Berry recommended that Lovell apply antihistamine ointment to ease nasal dryness.
On Dec. 11, laser experiment was conducted with partial success: the Hawaiian ground station received signals from the spacecraft when Lovell locked his hand-held laser onto the ground-based one, but contact was not precise or strong enough to carry a human voice.
On Dec. 12, the astronauts tried again to establish ground laser communications over White Sands Missile Range, but were able to pick up only two quick flashes from the ground beacon.
On Dec. 13, when gemini vii’s fuel cell warning light flashed on, the astronauts flushed excess water from the system by forcing in additional oxygen borrowed from the cabin’s oxygen supply, thereby correcting die difficulty. A taperecorder malfunction prevented the spacecraft from supplying automatic data on performance of its systems between tracking stations.
On Dec. 14, Borman observed reentry of a Minuteman missile fired from Vandenberg afb to Eniwetok—first time a missile reentry had been sighted by an astronaut. Both gemini vii astronauts were be-
ginning to feel the strain of their ten days in space: “Jim and I are beginning to notice the days seem to be lengthening a little,” Borman said. “We’re getting a little crummy.”
On Dec. 15, gemini vii and gemini vi achieved their historic rendezvous in orbit (see Dec. 15—16).
On Dec. 16, a report from gemini vii Astronauts Borman and Lovell that three of the six fuel cell stacks were not operating aroused apprehension that the flight might end prematurely.
Next day gemini vii’s fuel cells began to function satisfactorily, thereby assuring a full-duration mission. Astronauts Borman and Lovell checked out all their spacecraft’s systems and received reentry instructions.
On Dec. 18, gemini vii began a normal reentry when its four retrorockets fired automatically in correct sequence above the Pacific southeast of the Philippines. After a controlled reentry to the predetermined landing point, the spacecraft splashed down in the Atlantic at 9:06 a.m. est, 700 mi. southwest of Bermuda—only 7.6 mi. from target. The astronauts, after their record-breaking 330-hr. 35-min. spaceflight, were assisted from the capsule by Navy frogmen and taken to the carrier JFasp for medical debriefing, (nasa Release 65-362; nasa Proj.

December 4: President Johnson, after viewing on television the launching of gemini vii, said: “Once again, two brave Americans have carried the quest for knowledge to the threshold of space. They also take with them our prayers, and our pride. As they orbit the earth in the days and weeks ahead, Astronauts Frank Borman and James Lovell will broaden our knowledge of space. But they will do more. Their voyage will be a continuous reminder that the peaceful conquest of space is the only form of conquest in which modern man can proudly and profitably engage. In this struggle, all men are allies, and the only enemy is a hostile environment. The victory over the final enemy will belong, not just to Americans, but to all the world.

•	Soviet Premier Aleksey Kosygin was asked in an interview at the Krem-
lin by New York Times associate editor James Reston if expenditures for space exploration were questioned by Soviet government officials. He replied : “I would say that man will always go on seeking a solution to the problems of the universe. There will always be funds that will be set aside to resolve the problems relating to the world and the universe; this is all to the good, if it’s purely scientific. . . . We. don’t have any contradiction in the Soviet Union between appropriations for space research and for the needs of the population. The funds appropriated are relatively small compared with the funds serving the needs of the population on education and such. They are negligible on the over-all expenditure. Space expenses do not detract from the needs of the population.”
Asked if the U.S.S.R. wanted to go forward with peaceful space arrangements, Kosygin said: “We have expressed our view on this. We are in favor of peaceful, not military, uses of outer space. Now, to insure that peaceful research in space does not place too much of a burden on us, states might reduce military expenditures and channel the funds into peaceful space explorations.”
Reston queried: “You have made great progress in space with the use of the most sophisticated and complicated computers and other modern science, yet your speech on Sept. 27 was highly critical of the lag in the use of modern science in Soviet industry. Why this discrepancy?” Kosygin replied: “I don’t understand your distinction between space and economic and industrial development. We judge our economy as a whole—we include all spheres. It is true that not everything is going satisfactorily in science and technology. Not everywhere are the most advanced methods being used. We are now taking all possible measures and we shall remedy this situation. For
this it is necessary to utilize all the achievements of engineering thought. We are doing our utmost to insure the further rise of our economy and our technology. In four months I will make my report to the party congress on our forthcoming five-year development plan. In this plan our most advanced scientific and technical achievements will be mobilized.” (Text, NYT, 12/8/65, C20)

December 12: Attempt to launch Gemini vi from etr was unsuccessful when an electric plug connecting the Titan II booster to the launch pad fell loose 2}4 sec. early, causing the automatic sequencer to shut down the engine booster 1.2 sec. after ignition. Inside the Titan II a wire extended from the tail plug to tap a circuit which carried current from the batteries to an intervalometer—electric clock—which controls the first 21/% min. of powered flight. When the plug shook loose prematurely and started the clock, signals that liftoff had occurred were sent to the Titan ii’s automatic pilot, local guidance stations, and an automatic sequencing device at KSC Launch Control Center. The sequencer registered the mishap and shut down Titan Ii’s engines.

December 15-16: gemini vi, piloted by Walter Schirra, Jr. (Capt., usn), command pilot, and Thomas P. Stafford (Maj., usaf), pilot, was successfully launched from ETR with two-stage Titan II booster on NASA’s fifth manned spaceflight in the Gemini series and first rendezvous mission. It achieved an elliptical orbit: apogee, 161 mi. (259.7 km.); perigee, 100 mi. (161.1 km.); inclination, 28.9°; period, 88.7 min. Toward the end of the first revolution, GEMINI vi was trailing gemini vii by 1,200 mi. (1,935 km.). Schirra began series of posi-grade maneuvers in preparation for rendezvous in the fourth revolution by firing thruster rockets 18 sec. to shorten the distance between the two spacecraft to 730 mi. (1,177 km.). Schirra fired rear thruster rockets 77 sec. during the second revolution and GEMINI VI drew within 300 mi. (483 km.) of gemini vii; 30 min. later he fired another brief burn to move gemini vi 7/1000ths of a degree south to the same plane as gemini vn. With the spacecraft 431 mi. (695 km.) apart, Schirra fired the thrusters one second to shift gemini vi into a somewhat higher orbit—the only maneuver not prearranged by the flight plan. To shorten the 230-mi. (371-km.) distance between the two spacecraft as GEMINI VI entered its third revolution, Schirra fired his thrusters 53 sec. to shift into near-circular orbit: apogee, 170 mi. (274 km.); perigee, 165.5 mi. (267 km.); inclination, 89.9°. Schirra initiated terminal phase of the rendezvous maneuver with a 32 fps posigrade burn as gemini vi entered its fourth revolution. Gemini Vi and VII were then flying nose to nose about 25,000 ft. apart. Schirra applied a posigrade velocity of 43 fps and gemini vi approached within six feet—later determined to be one foot—of gemini vii. vi then performed an in-plane fly-around maneuver around vii, and later vii maneuvered beside vi. Flight plans had specified four hours of station keeping, but the two Geminis flew in formation, keeping within 20 to 100 ft. of each other, for 5 hrs., 19 min., during which time the astronauts photographed each others’ crafts, sighted a fire in Madagascar, and conversed. All crewmen took turns in the formation flying activities, to obtain rendezvous maneuvering experience. After 15 hrs., 19 min., Schirra fired GEMINI Vi’s thruster rockets to separate the two spacecraft about 15 mi. for drifting flight during the sleep period.
On Dec. 16, gemini vi Astronaut Schirra reported to Mission Control that an unidentified satellite in a low trajectory in polar orbit was trying to contact him. Before ground officials could respond, he and Stafford played Jingle Bells with a harmonica and bells.
GEMINI vi began reentry northeast of Canton Island in the Pacific during its 15th revolution; four retrorockets fired automatically in the correct sequence, each providing 2,500 lbs. thrust. Reentry was normal and was the first controlled reentry to a predetermined landing point in the U.S. manned spaceflight program.
gemini vi splashed down in the Atlantic at 10:29 a.m. est, 700 mi. south of Bermuda—only 14 mi. off target—after a 26-hr., 1-min. flight. Assisted from the spacecraft by Navy frogmen, the astronauts arrived by helicopter at the carrier Wasp at 11:20 a.m. for medical debriefing.

“On the crowded globe beneath the soaring astronauts men were still fighting each other, cursing each other, starving each other and maltreating each other. Not yet have mortals risen above man’s inhumanity to man. Not yet have they surmounted the emotions that set at naught the generations of light and learning. Not yet are they wise enough to govern their passions. But hope soars aloft with the astronauts.

December 21: usaf Titan m-c, launched from Eastern Test Range, encountered trouble with its transtage—third stage—and failed to reach near-synchronous equatorial orbit with four pick-a-back satellites. At lift-off, the booster’s two 1.2-million-lb.-thrust strap-on en-
gines and the Titan iii-C core vehicle functioned as scheduled, propelling the booster to 400,000-ft. altitude at 10,300 mph. Second stage ignited and the stages separated simultaneously with first stage burnout. Ten-second coast period followed second stage shutdown before stage was separated; three seconds after separation, the transtage, powered by twin engines rated at 8,000-lb. thrust each, ran for 17 sec. to drive vehicle into temporary parking orbit with apogee, 194 mi.

Medical and physical data from the two-week gemini vii flight indicated that man could withstand a lunar mission without any serious harm, reported Dr. Charles Berry, Chief of Medical Programs for NASA MSC, at the AAAS meeting. Dr. Berry revealed that the astronauts’ heart rates and blood pressures during the flight had remained within normal ranges and that within 10 hrs. after splashdown, Borman had regained 4.8 lbs. of the 9.6 lbs. he had lost; Lovell, who had lost 5.9 lbs., had regained 6.6 lbs. Berry, who doubted the astronauts could have endured 14 days in spacesuits, attributed much of the success of the mission to the freedom of flying in underwear. He reported that the electroencephalogram studies recording brain wave activity had shown no abnormalities during the first two flight days, but that the electrodes on the astronauts’ scalps had come loose before the end of the planned 4-day experiment. As to the radiation dosage hazards on the 14-day flight, Dr. Berry said the measured amounts were “peanuts.” The calcium balance studies which required measurements of calcium loss to sweat, blood, urine, and feces might take “several more months to complete,” he added.

As these steps were completed and technical goals achieved, the entire economy fell heir to the new technology. Key goals in defense and space programs were listed as: (1) lowering costs; (2) improv-
ing the efficiency of motors, generators, and all other energy conversion devices and processes; (3) improving design, that is, reducing the weight and increasing the strength of all machines, by either improved knowledge of the machine or by using lighter, stronger materials; (4) improving the accuracies to which machines could be controlled; (5) improving reliability; (6) improving communications between men, between men and machines, and between machines.

During 1965: In 1965, NASA attempted 28 missions with 23 successes, a score of 82% mission success. Two spacecraft were launched on a single booster. NASA attempted 30 launches of space boosters and had 26 successes, a score of 87% launch vehicle success.
Of the 92 payloads orbited by the U.S., NASA orbited 25—five of which were two-manned spacecraft and four were escape-mission probes. U.S.S.R. orbited 64 payloads, of which one was a manned spacecraft and seven were escape-mission probes. France entered the space age with two satellites, one orbited by France herself (a—i) and one by the U.S. (fr-i t.
Most spectacular of NASA’s space missions were the real-time reception of close-up lunar photographs by ranger ix, first U.S. extravehicular activity by gemini iv Astronaut White, man’s first close look at Mars (including 21 photographs) by mariner iv, and manned rendezvous to within one foot by gemini vi and vn. The Gemini program began 1965 with GT-2 unmanned suborbital flight; this was followed by four two-man orbital flights which logged more than 1,300 manhours in space, gemini v and vn, long-duration missions (8 and 14 days respectively) proved man can withstand extended conditions of spaceflight and validated plans for manned Apollo lunar flights. At the year’s end Gemini spaceflights had set for the U.S. more than 10 records, among them the record for total manhours in space: 1,354 hrs., 38 min., vs. U.S.S.R.’s 507 hrs., 16 min.
1965 was a year of extensive ground tests of the Apollo spacecraft and the Saturn launch vehicles. There were static firings of engines for the various Saturn IB and Saturn V stages, highlighted by full-duration firing of all three Saturn V stages. Saturn I program ended with a record of 10 successes out of 10 attempts, its three 1965 launches orbiting Pegasus meteoroid detection satellites. Fire II provided valuable data for Apollo on reentry from simulated lunar trajectory.
In lunar and planetary achievement, rangers viii and IX provided more than 13,000 lunar surface photographs and brought that project to a close. Atlas-Centaur ac-6 launched a dummy Surveyor on a simulated lunar transfer orbit and proved itself capable of operational Surveyor missions. NASA stepped up its interplanetary research with pioneer vi, first of four projected interplanetary satellites.
tiros ix became the first weather satellite to provide close to 100% coverage of the earth daily, and tiros x was the first in a series of interim operational satellites for the. U.S. Weather Bureau. Five Explorer scientific satellites, oso n, Canada’s alouette ii, and France’s
FR-I were orbited. NASA orbited secor v for the U.S. Army, SOLRAD ix (explorer xxx) for the U.S. Navy, and early bird i communications satellite for the Communications Satellite Corporation. NASA turned over syncoms II and III to dod for operational use at the completion of their r&d function.
The five NASA mission failures: vehicle test of Atlas-Centaur ac-5; test of Apollo launch escape system on a Little Joe II booster; failure of OGO ii, which did return good (but incomplete) experiment data; failure to orbit a third Orbiting Solar Observatory; and failure of Gemini 6 because Agena Target Vehicle did not achieve orbit.
In 39 successful launches, dod orbited 67 satellites. In addition, there were four unsuccessful DOD space launches, losing five payloads. Decision was made that DOD proceed with the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, and launches were begun of the powerful Titan iii-C which would eventually orbit the Mol.
Highlighting the U.S.S.R.’s busy space year was man’s first extra-vehicular space activity, by voskhod ii’s Cosmonaut Leonov. Soviet lunar exploration intensified, with apparent soft-landing attempts by lunas v through viii, as well as photographs of the moon’s hidden side by interplanetary probe zond III. U.S.SR. launched VENUS II and III on the long flight toward the planet Venus. (Western experts speculated that cosmos lx was an unsuccessful lunar soft-landing attempt and cosmos xcvi an unsuccessful Venus probe.) U.S.S.R. orbited 52 Cosmos satellites, two heavyweight Proton spacecraft, and her first communications satellites—two Molniyas I.

During 1965: Some nasa research highlights of 1965:
NASA launched 191 scientific sounding rockets to obtain a variety of scientific data and about 10 for advanced research an d techno!-ogy. By the end of the year, the three x-15 research aircraft had made 156 flights, 32 of them in 1965. Tests proceeded of the modified x—15 (No. 2), expected to exceed 5,000-mph flight speed, nasa supported the National supersonic transport program and evaluated wind tunnel models of the two proposed Sst designs. NASA continued using usaf XB-70 aircraft for research in flight problems of Sst and large supersonic aircraft in general. Feasibility studies of adapting V/Stol concepts to commercial transportation and wind-tunnel studies of several V/Stol designs continued. As part of research toward efficient design of hypersonic aircraft, comparative performance and heat transfer measurements were obtained on a variety of aircraft wings, bodies, and wing-body combinations. Ramjet engine research was in the engine design concept phase. NASA developed and tested a new near-field theory useful in predicting sonic boom characteristics of Sst configurations during transonic climb-out. Flight research of M-l lifting body was advanced, and construction of HL-10 lifting body was being completed.
Solid propulsion technology was advanced with static-firing of the 260-in. solid-fuel rocket motor. In nuclear rocket technology, three Nerva reactor experiments were completed and the new Phoebus advanced graphite reactor test program was begun. The success of a
2,600-hr. ion engine test provided evidence that life-times of 10,000 hrs. for electric rocket thrusters may be within reach. Among highlights in electronics and control was reentry communications experiment on GEMINI in demonstrating feasibility of water injection to overcome communications blackout during reentry.

awards, were headed by North American-Downey ($1,099,448,000), Boeing-New Orleans ($305,988,000), Grumman-Bethpage ($267,226,000), Douglas-Santa Monica ($251,668,000), GE-Huntsville ($181,472,000), McDonnell-St. Louis ($166,670,000), IBM-Huntsville ($128,312,000), Aerojet-Sacramento ($123,186,000), General Dynamics/Convair ($111,148,000), and RCA-Princeton ($106,552,000). Total NASA procurements for the year totaled $5,187,000,000 with the top 100 firms accounting for $4,141,434,000 of that amount, (nasa Ann. Procurement Rpt. FY 1965)
•	Some highlights of the year in physics: Planet Mars has no substantial
magnetic field, according to scientific experiments by mariner IV Mars probe. Because of this, Martian life-forms would have to be able to withstand intense radiation, but possibility of Martian life was not ruled out. mariner iv also reported Mars’ atmosphere was too thin to readily support parachute or glider-type descents for soft landings on the planet.
Comet Ikeya-Seki, the brightest comet to enter the solar system this century, was discovered Sept. 18 and subsequently studied from the ground, airplanes, and rockets. The comet passed within 300,000 mi. of the sun and made a hairpin turn Oct. 21, when it broke into three pieces.
Results of NASA’s testing of public reaction to sonic booms, begun in 1961, showed that no serious psychological or physiological effects result from sonic booms. Commercial use of the supersonic transport, to begin in early 1970’s, was expected to create sonic booms that, when Sst’s come into full use in the U.S., would be heard by everyone about once a day.
On the subject of antimatter, two items: Swedish physicist Hannes Alfven theorized such cosmic phenomena as quasi-stellar radio sources (“quasars”), radio stars, and supernovae may be powered by matter-antimatter annihilations; and, antideutrons were produced in the laboratory by scientists of Columbia Univ.
Unwanted noise from a BTL horn-reflector antenna being used in comsat research may have been radiation from the birth of the universe. This interpretation was based on the “big bang” theory of
the universe’s formation and was propounded by a group of Princeton Univ. scientists.
Decision was believed near on which of the three principal models of the universe was correct—the steady-state, expanding, or oscillating universe theory. Results in astronomy based on red-shifts of “blue-galaxies” (discovered in 1965) and quasars hinted at an oscillating universe, (aip News, 12/22/65)
During 1965: Among highlights in the U.S. communications satellite program were: initiation of commercial comsat operations, with EARLY BIRD I in synchronous orbit over the Atlantic; initiation of a synchronous-orbit comsat program to furnish communications for Project Apollo and for expanded commercial service; and growth of the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium to 48 member nations, representing every continent. Communications Satellite Corp. represented the U.S. and served as manager for the consortium. (Com-SatCorp Release)
•	LRC completed 10 experiments to explore nuclear engine chilldown (cool-
ing by liquid hydrogen propellant) and to determine the range of conditions for which flow oscillations would occur in an engine system. An additional 16 runs were conducted to obtain data on the “bootstrap” starting of a nuclear engine. Results of these tests indicated that nuclear rocket engines should be able to start smoothly and stably over a wide range of startup conditions. (Atomic Energy Programs, 1965,148-49)
•	Nearly 390,000 visitors toured NASA Kennedy Space Center and Cape
Kennedy. The Space Center’s doors were first opened to visitors Jan. 3, 1965. In its first year, the Center was host to visitors from all 50 states and 57 countries.	(NASA Space Sheet, 3/31/66)
•	Visitor attendance at the MSFC Space Orientation Center was 202,445, an
increase of about 37% over 1964. (ivisfc Historian)
•	In the last half of the year, usaf doubled its airlift to Southeast Asia,
mainly Vietnam. In the first six months of 1965 the Military Air Transport Service (mats) airlifted 37,684 tons of cargo and 91,994 passengers to the area. In the last half, it flew in 58,858 tons of cargo and 183,132 passengers.
usaf flew 10,570 tactical sorties over North Vietnam and 37,940 over South Vietnam (compared to 764 for 1964); vnaf flew an additional 23,700 sorties during 1965, mostly over South Vietnam. (Watson, Balt. Sun, 1/6/66; Brownlow, Av. Wk., 1/10/66)
