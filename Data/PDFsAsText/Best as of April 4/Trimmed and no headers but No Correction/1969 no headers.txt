January 1: Washington Evening Star editorial said of success of Dec. 21—27, ,1968, Apollo 8 mission: “Modern science undercut man’s bland belief that he was the center of the universe, and modern philosophy reduced him to a trivial atom of matter in the larger cosmos. To be able to sail around at will in that vast cosmos may give man back some of the confidence he once had, not the arrogance of thinking that he understands the whole pattern, but the quiet sense that he will not flinch from what he may yet learn.” (W Star, 1/1/69, A15)
•	U.S.S.R. disclosed that converted MiG fighter was prototype used for
testing design features and performance of Tu-144, Soviet supersonic aircraft. Soviet aviation writer for Pravda K. Raspevin said four-man crew aboard Tu-144 maiden flight Dec. 31, 1968, was one of most experienced in U.S.S.R. Pilot was Eduard V. Yelyan. Copilot Mikhail V. Kozlov had won title Hero of the Soviet Union for testing Tu-22 supersonic strategic bomber. Tu-144 was constructed of light alloys with titanium on leading edges and other areas subjected to high temperatures. At cruising speed, outside skin temperature was 150° C. Air conditioning system cooled cabin. Tail unit was minus horizontal guiding surface. Crew members had catapult seats as safety precaution during test flights. (NYT, 1/2/69, 7)

January 4: At Explorers Club symposium in New York scientists, educators, community leaders, and students discussed significance of Apollo 8 mission. William Booth, Chairman of Commission on Human Rights in New York, said, “I still am quite disturbed by the fact that we’re dying at home, people are about to starve. There’s overpopulation and underproduction of food in the world. We haven’t been able to solve these problems and here we are going off to the moon.” Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said flights were “a means of concentrating our energies toward building a technological capability.” Moon flight had played “same role as Lindbergh’s flight to Paris” in that it demonstrated new capability. Space program was paying economic dividends in communications, mineral exploration, and new materials. Dr. Maynard M. Miller, Chairman of Explorer Club’s World Center for Exploration Foundation, said, “The word ‘impossible’ has a different meaning after Apollo'8. Perhaps its real contribution will be as a symbol of man’s willingness to dare to do something great.” (Wilford, NYT, 1/5/69, 26)
January 5: Venus V unmanned probe was successfully launched by U.S.S.R. on four-month journey to Venus. Tass announced that 2,491-lb spacecraft had been launched into parking orbit and then injected on trajectory toward Venus to softland, conduct extensive scientific research, and continue studies begun by Venus IV, which landed on Venusian surface Oct. 18, 1967. All equipment was functioning normally. Spacecraft carried pennants with bas-relief of Lenin and Soviet coat of arms and “greater range of scientific and measuring equipment, making it possible to improve the accuracy of measurements and to obtain additional data on planet’s atmosphere,” Moscow News said.

•	Washington Sunday Star editorial commented on proposals made at
aaas meeting in Dallas, Tex., Dec. 26—31, 1968, for agency to establish priorities for Federal spending in research, education, technology, weapon development, and science. Dr. James V. Shannon, former nih director, had proposed creation of top-level council equal in stature to National Security Council and Council of Economic Advisers. Dr. Donald F. Hornig, President Johnson’s Science Adviser, had recommended adding Secretary of Science to Presidential Cabinet. Star said, “There will be strong opposition to both of these proposals. The cry of centralization will be raised.” However: “What is proposed . . . is a body of. informed advisers, whose duty it is to suggest ... to instruct the President, the Congress and public on the potentialities for good and evil that could result if a given path were followed. The President would still have to make the executive decisions. Congress would still control the purse. The public would still have the final verdict of the ballot. But all of them could use some responsible, expert guidance through the awesome and fantastic new world that lies just ahead.” (W Star, 1/5/69, Gl)
January 6: Oao II (launched Dec. 7, 1968) completed 30 days of flight operation and was adjudged successful by NASA. Experiments had obtained 65 hrs of scientific data over range of eight magnitudes and 4,200 A—1,100 A wavelengths. Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory celescope experiment made 18 mappings and Univ. of Wisconsin experiment made detailed observations of 100 stars. Some 40,000 separate commands had been sent to Oao II and more than 4 million pieces of information had been collected, with 20 times more uv information from stars in 30 days than in 15 yrs of sounding rocket launchings. Satellite’s 11 telescopes were studying extremely young, hot stars which emitted most of their energy in uv portion of spectrum, not visible to ground observatories because of earth’s atmosphere, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 69—7)
•	Budget squeeze had forced NASA to drop 16 institutions from its sustain-
ing university program, Scientific Research said. Four others were dropped in 1968; 30 remained. Contracts of the 16 would not be renewed as they expired unless institutions devised exceptional research proposals. Then money would probably have to be taken from other universities. Grants had ranged from $75,000 to $300,000, with total saving of $4 million over FYs 1969, 1970, and 1971 expected from cancellation. Program funding had declined from $45 million in FYs 1965 and 1966 to $30 million in FY 1967, $10 million in FY 1968, and $9 million in 1969. FY 1970 budget level was expected to be $9 million.

January 6-8: Three-article series on “The Cost of Preparedness” by Orr Kelly in Washington Evening Star quoted interviews with outgoing Johnson Administration defense experts who agreed U.S. might be entering peaceful era in international relations though defense cost would remain high—at least $50 billion annually—in foreseeable future. Secretary of Defense Clark M. Clifford thought, “cautious and forceful steps” could be taken “to improve the lot of the people of the world.”
usn saw post-Vietnam war need for modernization, with emphasis on nuclear-powered escort ships; usaf wanted new fighter, manned bomber, deployment of interim bomber, and revamping of U.S. air defense force.
Dr. John S. Foster, Director of Defense Research and Engineering, said: “The Soviets have four characteristics of special concern to the r&d community. They are technically advanced, they are strong economically, they have an aggressive military posture—and they work behind a veil of secrecy. The one that makes competition difficult is secrecy. To counter it, the United States must have technological superiority. We must have been there, technically, before them.” (W Star, 1/6—8/69)
January 7: U.S. patent No. 3,420,471 was granted to John D. Bird, Howell D. Garner, Ernest D. Lounsberry, and David E. Thomas, Jr., LaRC engineers who assigned rights to NASA for jet shoes to enable astronauts to move in space. Wearer could rotate body by natural ankle and leg motions and control direction by turning body and aiming head in swimming motion. Previous devices for similar purpose required use of one or both hands or operation of complex arrangement of control jets and gyroscope sensors. Toe pressure in new shoes would release nitrogen through thruster in sole of each shoe. With electrical control, pressure would be applied to switch. Alternate method would be fluidic control, with toes pressing syringe. (Pat Off pio; NYT, 1/11/69, 39)
•	Once Vietnam war was over, Michael Harrington said in Washington
Evening Star, there would be “money enough for both slums and space if the nation has the political will to appropriate it.” Space exploration could provide “economic alternative to war.” It was “simply not true that the United States must choose between the heavens and earth. By the mid-Seventies, this country will have achieved a $1 trillion gross national product and because of this . . . there will be almost $30 billion in ‘extra’ federal funds by 1972. That projection does not require any increase in taxes and it assumes that there will be a fairly high level of military spending.” (W Star, 1/7/69, A7)

January 9: usaf released three-volume Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, report of Univ. of Colorado scientists directed by Dr. Edward U. Condon. It concluded that “nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. . . . Further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.” Scientists felt “the reason that there has been very little scientific study of the subject is that those scientists who are most directly concerned, astronomers, atmospheric physicists, chemists, and psychologists, having had ample opportunity to look into the matter, have individually decided that UFO phenomena do not offer a fruitful field in which to look for major scientific discoveries.”
In review of study, nas special review panel had concluded, “On the basis of present knowledge the least likely explanation of UFOs is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitations by intelligent beings.”
Condon report recommended dod handle UFO sighting reports in normal surveillance operations and found no basis for contention that ufo data were “shrouded in official secrecy.” Report stated, “The history of the past 21 years has repeatedly led Air Force officers to the conclusion that none of the things seen, or thought to have been seen . . . constituted any hazard or threat to national security.” Report of two-year study, commissioned by USAF for $500,000, had been approved by nas panel.

[And] that ends an era, so to speak, in the space program which President Kennedy started when he proposed attainment of a landing on the moon by the end of this decade.” Question would be raised “in Congress and in the administration and by the 'people of the country, ‘OK we’re all through now, let’s save that four billion or five billion dollars a year and settle back and do something less expensive.’ I don’t believe that this is a very widespread view in the top levels of the new administration. I think the Apollo 8 program came at a very critical moment” to make everyone see that “by lifting the eyes of the people to something beyond this little planet on which we live that the spiritual effect . . . the elevation of morale which has occurred, the pride which the country has taken in this sort of achievement, ■ following on the many other achievements, is going to be a stimulus to redirecting the program, yes, but certainly not abandoning it, and deciding what are the great things that can be done in the future of the space program.” (Transcript)

•	Apollo 8 astronauts were honored in Nation’s Capital.
Astronauts Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, and William A. Anders received NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Johnson at White House. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Acting Administrator, read citation, identical for each astronaut, except for designation as commander, command module pilot, or lunar module pilot. Borman received award “for outstanding contributions to space flight, engineering, technology and exploration as Commander of Apollo 8, mankind’s first venture beyond Earth into orbit around the Moon. During this flawless mission from December 21 to December 27, 1968, he made critical decisions and carried out complex maneuvers to fly into precise translunar injection, lunar orbit, and transearth injection flight paths to a successful reentry and splashdown within 5,000 yards of the recovery vessel. His scientific observations during the journey to and from the Moon and during 10 orbits of the Moon have added significantly to man’s knowledge. He displayed outstanding leadership, courage, professional skill and devotion to duty in accomplishing all planned mission objectives, significantly advancing the nation’s capabilities in space. As one of history’s boldest explorers, he has blazed a new trail for mankind out into the vastness of extraterrestrial space.”
President Johnson said: “Our space program, and this, its most
spectacular achievement, have taught us some very invaluable lessons. We have learned how men and nations may make common cause in the most magnificent and hopeful enterprises of mankind. We in the United States are already engaged in cooperative space activities with more than 70 nations of the world. We have proposed a variety of adventures to expand international partnership in space exploration. This morning I renew America’s commitment to that principle and to its enormous promise. The flight of Apollo 8 gives all nations a new and a most exciting reason to join in man’s greatest adventure.” President Johnson presented retired NASA Administrator James E. Webb as “the single man most responsible for successfully administering this program and, I think, the best Administrator in the Federal Government.”
Astronauts gave President Johnson miniature copies of recent international space treaties which they had carried aboard Apollo 8 spacecraft and “picture of the ranch” (photo of earth taken from space). {PD, 1/13/69, 35-6)
After awards ceremony astronauts were driven in motorcade to address joint assembly of Congress attended by nine Supreme Court Justices. Borman told Congress: “The one overwhelming emotion that we carried with us is the fact that we really do all exist on the small globe. And when you get to 240,000 miles, it really isn’t a very large earth.” He said voyage was not just an American achievement; “we stood on the shoulders of giants,” from Newton and Galileo to present day scientists and space explorers. “If Apollo 8 was a triumph at all,” Borman said, “it was a triumph of all mankind.”
At State Dept. Auditorium press conference, NASA Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs Julian Scheer announced Astronaut Frank Borman had been appointed Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations at msc.
During conference astronauts disclosed they had not seen moon during approach to lunar orbit; presented slides indicating presence of volcanics on back of moon; and announced their conclusion that conditions on pseudolanding site, B—1, indicated “lighting conditions are . . . adequate for a lunar landing, which was one of our objectives of the flight.” Borman said, “I came away with the idea that the moon may be more homogeneous than I had realized . . . that you could get a spoon one place and find it just about the same as the samples somewhere else.” In answer to question, he said, “I don’t believe we found anything that would be of concern to future flights. We flight-tested the ground system. We flight-tested the airborne system. The command module and service module have effectively performed their designed task, their designed mission, with the exception of docking. We have got magnificent machinery. We have superb ground support.”
Following press conference, astronauts and their families were guests at Smithsonian Institution dinner in Washington, D.C. (Transcript; NASA Release 69-8; Wilford, NYT, 1/10/69, 1; Maynard, W Post, 1/10/69, 1; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 1/10/69, 1)

“Of all the debts the American people owe President Johnson, none is likely to loom larger over time than that he started them on the road to mastery of this new, unlimited environment by means of the new rocket technology. ... It is the lasting tribute to Lyndon Baines Johnson that he has seen from the beginning that accomplishments in space and the capability which can sustain and increase these accomplish-
ments constitute a new barometer of the stature of our Nation.” (CR, 1/17/69, S496)

January 15: President Johnson in message transmitting FY 1970 budget to Congress said major recommended decreases in budget authority from 1969 to 1970 included $235 million for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which “will provide for a program level equal to 1969 when combined with prior year funds.” Major increases included “522 million for airway modernization, highways, and other activities” in DOT. Of estimated $11.6 billion increase in total budget outlays, $0.5 billion was for national defense, “largely for improvements in our strategic forces, modernization of our tactical air forces, and other increased research and development efforts needed to assure sufficient deterrent power in the future. These increases will be substantially offset by reduced outlays for Vietnam resulting from changing combat patterns and revised supply requirements. ... In keeping with national priorities, major social programs account for largest portion” of increase.
President said: “The record of achievements of the past 5 years is an impressive one. We have witnessed a period of unprecedented economic growth, with expanded production, rising standards jof living, and the lowest rates of unemployment in a decade and a half. Our military forces today are the strongest in the world. . . . Last month saw man’s first successful flight to the moon.

•	President Johnson sent $195.3-billion FY 1970 budget request to Con-
gress, including total space budget of $5,946 billion. Of this sum, NASA would receive $3,599 billion (plus $7.89 million for aircraft technology and $117 million in unobligated funds from prior years to be applied to 1970 program); dod would receive $2,219 billion; aec, $105 million; essa, $10 million; nsf, $4 million; Dept, of Interior, $6 million; and Dept, of Agriculture, $4 million.
Total NASA FY 1970 budget request of $3,878 billion was below $4
billion for first time since FY 1963 request. Expenditures were budgeted to decline nearly $300 million from FY 1969 level of $4,250 billion, to $3,950 billion. Of budget request, $3,168 billion would go for r&d, $58.2 million for construction of facilities, and $650.9 million for program management. Slightly more than 50% of total FY 1970 authority—$2,008 billion—would be in manned space flight, including Saturn IB Workshop and Apollo Telescope Mount. Space science and applications were allotted $558.8 million; advanced research and technology, $290.4 million.
Larger proportion of NASA funds would go to research than to development in FY 1970 as Apollo costs declined. Increases would go to Apollo Applications (total $308.8 million in FY 1970), 1971 Mariner-Mars flight ($45.4 million), Viking project ($40 million), 1973 Mariner-Mercury ($3 million), Planetary Explorers ($8 million), Applications Technology Satellites ($44.2 million), and Earth Resources Survey program ($25.1 million). Aeronautical vehicle technology program, up from $74.9 million to $78.9 million, included $21.78 million for advanced research, $500,000 for general aviation, $11.25 million for v/stol, $16.19 million for subsonic aircraft, $20.9 million for supersonic aircraft, and $8.28 million for hypersonic aircraft.
DOD space funding would include satellite development, certain portions of missile development and operating costs, mol (increased to $576 million), Titan III booster, and supporting R&D. In addition, aircraft r&d funds of $1.4 billion would include $500 million for new usn F—14A fighter to replace F—11 IB, $1 billion for series of advanced jet aircraft, $75 million for long-range bomber to succeed B—52, and funds for usaf F—15 fighter and usn vsx antisubmarine aircraft.
aec space funding included amounts for nuclear rocket, propulsion technology and nuclear power sources for space applications, including production of isotopic fuels and aerospace safety. ESSA funds would support Earth Resources Technology Satellite (erts) program research. nsf’s total request was up from $400 million in FY 1969 to $497 million. Of this amount, its $4-million space funds were for research in astronomy using rockets and satellite-borne observation instruments. Dept, of Interior would conduct experiments with data from erts spacecraft.
faa’s r&d budget would increase from $49 million in FY 1969 to $59 million in FY 1970. Principal increases were for research on air traffic control and noise abatement. President Johnson requested no additional funds for sst program, (nasa Release, 1/15/69; bob Special Analysis Q; Dale, NYT, 1/16/69, 1; Schmeck, NYT, 1/16/69, 24; Lindsey, NYT, 1/16/69, 81; W Post, 1/16/69, A12)
• NASA released transcript of Jan. 14 briefing on NASA FY 1970 budget at which Dr. Thomas O. Paine, nasa Acting Administrator, said $3,878-billion budget approved by President Johnson had been developed “to maintain an austere but balanced NASA aeronautics and space program aimed at major program goals of high national priority.”
Goals were continuing advances in space applications, including initiation of experimental earth resources technology satellites and slightly decelerated research on space environment; achieving manned lunar landing and additional Apollo moon missions, with limited provision for studies—not for development—of equipment to achieve
longer lunar stay-times and mobility for future exploration; proceeding with Saturn I Workshop and Apollo Telescope Mount; proceeding with Viking Project to land instruments on Mars in 1973; initiating in FY 1970 Mariner flyby in 1973 of Venus and Mercury; producing family of small planetary Explorers for orbiting Mars and Venus; making preliminary observations of Jupiter with previously approved Pioneer spacecraft; continuing work on unmanned orbiting astronomical observatories; continuing advanced aerospace technology work at about current levels; emphasizing noise reduction, with construction of special noise research laboratory; developing full potential of civil and military aeronautics; and undertaking NERVA project for development of flight-weight nuclear engine.
Dr. Paine noted FY 1970 budget, as approved by President Johnson, “would halt a four-year downward trend in NASA budget.” It was “austere and does not make full use of the aerospace capabilities that the nation has developed. . . .” But it permitted “a balanced program of useful work in critical areas.” Budget left “the major new program decisions, especially in the manned flight area, for the next Administration,” and was “ ‘holding budget’ that provides for progress, but defers critical program and funding decisions to the new Administration.” (Transcript)
•	Apollo Program Director, l/g Samuel C. Phillips (usaf), addressed
National Space Club luncheon in Washington, D.C., on impact of Apollo 8: “Many, if not most, of the world’s newspapers heralded the flight as evidence of the greatness of the United States. I’m told journalists in Germany, England and France speculated on the improved position that the U.S. would enjoy in the diplomatic arenas in which it is engaged in very important discussions. I’m told that a French paper went so far as to say that the lunar flight had vindicated Capitalism as the best system of government, and vindicated our free enterprise system as the most effective way to make progress. I’m aware from personal correspondence and discussions as well as reports in the press that scientists throughout the world have been equally impressed and that they’ve applauded the progress that this flight indicates for us.”
Gen. Phillips described Apollo 9 mission as “far less spectacular than Apollo 8, but . . . more complex.” It would be “certainly one of the most vital missions that we’ve had in our mission sequence over the years that leads us to a lunar landing.” Risks would be different but “I personally think they’re a little greater than the risks which we knowingly accepted in committing the Apollo 8 mission.”
Apollo 10 would be fifth Saturn V—505—with 106 command and service module and LM-4. Crew would be Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford, John W. Young, and Eugene A. Cernan. Scheduled for May, its objectives were “to demonstrate the performance of the crew, the space vehicle, and the mission support facilities during a manned lunar mission with the Command and Service Module and Lunar Module, and to evaluate the performance of the Lunar Module in a cislunar and lunar environment.” (Text)

•	In inaugural address following his taking oath of office as President of
U.S., Richard M. Nixon said: “Those who would be our adversaries, we invite to a peaceful competition;—not in conquering territory or extending dominion, but in enriching the life of man. As we explore the reaches of space, let us go to the new worlds together—not as new worlds to be conquered but as a new adventure to be shared. . . . Only a few short weeks ago, we shared the glory of man’s first sight of the world as God sees it, as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness. As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon’s gray surface on Christmas Eve, they spoke to us of the beauty of Earth—and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance, we heard them invoke God’s blessing on its goodness. In that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write:
“ ‘To see the Earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the Earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold— brothers who know now they are truly brothers.’
“In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity—seeing in that far perspective that man’s destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the stars but on Earth itself, in our hands, in our own hearts.” (PD, 1/21/69, 150-154; CR, 1/20/69, S561)

(Harris, Federal Times, 3/5/69, 9) January 22—29: NASA’s Oso V (oso—f) Orbiting Solar Observatory was successfully launched from etr by three-stage Thor-Delta (DSV—3C) booster to study the sun and its influence on earth’s atmosphere. Orbital parameters: apogee, 353.1 mi (568.2 km) ; perigee, 337.8 mi (543.6 km) ; period, 95.8 min; and inclination, 32.96°. Primary mission objective was to obtain high-resolution spectral data from pointed experiments in 1 A—1,250 A range during one solar rotation and conduct raster scans of solar disc in selected wavelengths. Secondary objective was to obtain useful data from nonpointed and pointed experiments for more than one solar rotation with extended observations of single lines and solar flares.
Fifth of eight spacecraft launched in NASA’s oso program to provide direct observation of sun during most of 11-yr solar cycle, Oso V weighed 636 lbs, carried eight experiments, was designed with six-month lifetime, and had two main sections—wheel (lower) section, which provided stability by gyroscope spinning and housed telemetry-command equipment, batteries, gas-spin control arms, and five experiment packages; and sail (upper) Section, which contained solar cells and solar pointing experiments and was oriented toward sun. Experiments, designed to continue and extend work of preceding OSO spacecraft, were provided by University College (London) and Univ. of Leicester, Univ. of Paris, Univ. of Colorado, Univ. of Minnesota, Naval Research Laboratory, and gsfc.
Both tape recorders were turned on and were operating satisfactorily and all spacecraft subsystems were operating nominally, nrl wheel x-ray experiment was turned on during 11th orbit and was obtaining good data. By Jan. 29 Oso V had received 707 commands and had completed 102 orbits. All eight experiments had been turned on and obtained good scientific data. All spacecraft systems—including raster scan and both tape recorders—had operated satisfactorily. Data from gsfc x-ray experiment were being used to plot spectrum of sun. Data from NRL uv pointed experiment had been used to obtain Oso P’s first Lyman-alpha spectroheliograph.
Oso I (launched March 7, 1962) and Oso II (launched Feb. 3, 1965) had surpassed their six-month design lifetimes and, together,

January 25: Apollo 9 prime crew—Astronauts James A. McDivitt (commander), David R. Scott (cm pilot), and Russell L. Schweickart (lm pilot)—held press briefing at Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp.’s Bethpage, N.Y., plant. Describing 10-day mission scheduled to begin Feb. 28 as primarily engineering evaluation of lunar module, McDivitt said: “. . . we will be giving the . . . lm hardware a very close scrutiny. We don’t expect to find anything, but our job is to go up there and look for it. Now after we have discovered that the lm is a good vehicle, we have ... to prove the joint operations techniques that we’ve tried to develop on the ground over the last 3 years. It’s one thing to fly one spacecraft in orbit, and have it controlled by the ground, but when you get 2 of them up there, they are trying to look at 2 vehicles simultaneously so that . . . you find the ground talking to 2 spacecraft and 2 spacecraft talking back to each other and also to the ground, and it becomes a rather unwieldly communications effort.” He added re-
minder that “only one of these vehicles has the capability to land— safely, I guess I should add. They both have the capability of landing. We only have one set of parachutes and one heat shield.” He described lm as “a tissue paper spacecraft,” explaining it did not have to reenter earth’s atmosphere and there was no atmosphere on moon.
Scott said they now had “a new vehicle ... a command module lm combination ... a particularly unique situation, in that ... we have to do the lunar orbit insertion [in lunar mission] with the two vehicles joined together with a very large mass on the end of the command module, so it’s a completely new guidance task” to be checked out.
McDivitt explained separation of lm from cm on rendezvous day, with two vehicles pulling away from each other and performing maneuvers, moving up to 100 mi apart: “The object ... is to evaluate our systems from a propulsion standpoint, electrical standpoint, the staging sequence, all of the components that we can and still get back safely to the command module.”
In response to question on relation of Apollo program to life on earth, McDivitt replied: “. . . if you’re not moving forward ... the rest of the world is and they’re going to pass you by. We’re gaining something and we’re gaining knowledge. . . . We’re going to move forward on all fronts, we’re not moving forward on just the space front. . . . Any organized system of intelligence moves forward in all directions, and . . . that is what we are doing.” (Transcript)

•	NASA successfully launched two Nike-Cajun, one Areas, and three Nike-
Apache sounding rockets from Wallops Station, carrying experiments to measure meteorological, ionospheric, and composition characteristics of upper atmosphere during “winter anomaly”—unusual absorption of radio waves—which occurred during January or early February.
Launches would contribute to specimen day program, coordinated investigation of winter variability of ,D region of ionosphere above Wallops.
Nike-Cajuns carried GSFC payloads to 75.2-mi (121-km) and 12.4-mi (20-km) altitudes. All 19 grenades on each rocket detonated as planned and sound arrivals were recorded, but poor vehicle performance of second rocket prevented acquisition of useful data.
Areas carried Naval Weapons Center payload to 33.2-mi (53.4-km) altitude to measure ozone concentration in 18.6- to 37.3-mi (30- to 60-km) region during parachute descent, but parachute did not deploy satisfactorily and payload descended too rapidly for recovery.
First Nike-Apache carried Univ. of Illinois-GCA Corp. payload to 141.1-mi (227-km) altitude to investigate winter variability of D region of ionosphere and measure differential absorption, Faraday rotation, and probe current to determine electron density, collision frequency, and temperature. Second Nike-Apache carried Univ. of Colorado payload to 71.5-mi (115-km) altitude to obtain vertical profile of nitric oxide density, using scanning monochromoter. Third Nike-Apache carried GSFC payload to 72.1-mi (116-km) altitude to measure degree of polarization and intensity of nitric oxide emission at 2,147 A to determine whether resonance scattering of sunlight was responsible for emission in D and E regions. Secondary objective was to determine altitude profile in 46.6- to 65.2-mi (75- to 105-km) region. Desired spectrum was not observed, apparently because of mechanical failure in payload, (nasa Rpts srl; WS Release 69—3)

During January: jpl Senior Staff Scientist Albert R. Hibbs summarized results of NASA’s Surveyor program in Astronautics and Aeronautics. Experiments on five Surveyor spacecraft which successfully landed on moon between May 30, 1966, and Jan. 7, 1968, indicated surface material was granular and very fine with 10 3 dynes/cm2 cohesion. Slightly deeper material had lower normal albedo than undisturbed
surface. Chemical composition of surface material was similar to basaltic rocks on earth; mare material contained more iron elements than highland material; and highland material had higher albedo than mare material. Chemical analyses indicated material did not resemble chondritic meteorites. From observed data scientists concluded that moon had undergone significant chemical differentiation during its history and had been subjected to basaltic lava flows; surface was continually being “churned and pulverized” by meteoroid impacts; some undefined process lightened optical surface and darkened buried material; and mare areas were “surprisingly similar and offer numerous safe-landing zones for future lunar missions.” (A&A, 1/69, 50—63)

•	In New York Times Magazine, Dr. Ralph E. Lapp, physicist, wrote:
“. . . I would urge that we alter the U.S. space program as follows: First, make a firm decision to terminate the manned space program soon after the initial lunar landing. ... I would reserve the remaining Apollo craft for future unmanned missions to the planets and I would mothball the single-purpose manned space flight facilities. At the same time, I would continue a n.a.S.a. program of long-range space development aimed at advanced modes of propulsion, compact energy sources and improved long-distance communication. High priority would be assigned to the development of nuclear energy both for propulsion and for on-board power.
“Second, greatly expand n.a.s.a.’s present program for exploiting applications of space science and technology. The potential of satellites for communications . . . needs to be enhanced by the development of new techniques. It should not be too difficult to develop orbital systems for the control of intercontinental air traffic. Perhaps the greatest benefits from satellites are to be expected in the survey and evaluation of earth resources, such as underground water, mineral deposits and plant-forest cover. . . .
“Third, establish a high priority within n.a.S.a. for fundamental research using unmanned space vehicles ... 10 to 20 years in duration and . . . aimed at finding out more about our planet, the sun and the rest of the solar system. The most expensive—and probably the most dramatic—of these projects would be the planetary probes designed to fly by, orbit or land on the nearby planets.” (NYT, 2/2/69, 32—40)

•	In Look, science writer Arthur C. Clarke, Nobel Prize nuclear physicist
Dr. Isidor I. Rabi, novelist C. P. Snow, and Catholic theologian Prof. Leslie Dewart wrote personal reactions to Apollo 8 mission. Clarke said: “The Apollo 8 mission marks one of those rare turning points in human history after which nothing will ever be the same again. The immense technical achievement is already obvious to every one and has been universally praised; yet the psychological impact may be even more important and will take some time to make itself fully felt. We no longer live in the world which existed before Christmas 1968. It has passed away as irrevocably as the earth-centered universe of the Middle Ages.”
Dr. Rabi said: “It would be misleading to talk of the events that led to the journey of Apollo 8 in terms of the vast sums of money that are involved, even though it cost several times as much as the development of the first atomic bomb. What is more important and more impressive is that Apollo 8 represents the cooperation of hundreds of thousands of people over a period of years in a gigantic effort with no clearly set practical goals, except perhaps the profound desire of mankind to prove to itself that it had the knowledge and the ability to overcome its earthbound limitations.”
Prof. Dewart said: “Man has taken his first, halting steps into the cosmos beyond that earthly world in which he was born and within which he had always lived. The impact of Apollo 8 in other areas of human experience is obvious; in religion, it is much less immediately evident. And yet, in the end, it may be more significant for the development of man’s religious consciousness.” {Look, 2/4/69, 72—8)

costs of maintaining an effective program expand in direct proportion. Already, the first limited steps have resulted in an economic burden that the richest nation in the world finds almost intolerable. If the adventure is to continue much longer, it will have to be as an international effort. Nixon’s inaugural statement raises the possibility that some international body, a sort of United Nations for space exploration, could be established to pool the talents and the resources of all nations. It is an idea well worth pursuing. (W Star, 2/6/69, A10)

Our sights were set upon this goal nearly a decade ago by President Kennedy. I was, I confess, one who feared he had asked the impossible.”
Weather forecasting—one example of earth-oriented use of space science—would require space satellites of new and sophisticated character. “We will not solve this problem unless we can somehow inspire atmospheric scientists of all the world to commit themselves to the goal. . . . Space technology is perhaps the most important single component of the technology development needed for success. What better use could be found for our incredible talents in space?

•	Supercritical wing would be flight-tested on usn F—8 fighter at FRC, NASA
announced. Airfoil shape had been developed in four-year wind-tunnel studies at LaRC by Dr. Richafd T. Whitcomb. If wind-tunnel performance was achieved in flight, wing could improve performance and efficiency of future aircraft, particularly jet transports. It would allow efficient cruise flight near speed of sound at 45,000-ft altitude and reduce operational cost of subsonic flights by increasing operational range or permitting less fuel and more payload on faster schedules.
Supercritical wing shape was developed to delay rise of drag force and onset of buffeting at high speeds. Flattened top was designed to reduce intensity of airflow disturbances; downward curve at rear of wing supplied lift lost by flattening. Flight program would evaluate behavior of wing in actual flight with both high-lift maneuvering and off-design performance, and determine sensitivity of supercritical wing to wing-contour variations associated with manufacturing processes and deformations due to flight loads, (nasa Release 69—27)
February 9: NASA announced the supercritical wing, a new airfoil shape developed in four years of wind-tunnel studies at Langley Research Center, would fie flight-tested on a USN F-8 fighter at the Flight Research Center. Dr. Richard T. IF hit comb, inventor of the design expected to improve performance of subsonic fet transports, stood with his model in the test section of the wind tunnel at Lane.

February 10: NAS published NRC Div. of Engineering’s Useful Applications of Earth-Oriented Satellites, Report of the Central Review Committee of NRC Summer Study on Space Applications, prepared for NASA. Study concluded that space applications program was “too small by a factor of two or three.” Benefits from program were expected to be large, “certainly larger than the costs of achieving them.” However, “an extensive, coherent, and selective program” would be required to achieve benefits.
Committee recommended that NASA give greater emphasis to earth-satellite programs with promise of beneficial applications, commit additional funds to expanded R&D and prototype operations for certain applications, and commit $200 million to $300 million yearly to space applications program. Manned space programs should be justified in their own right, not in terms of space applications; near-term benefits for mankind would be achieved “more effectively and economically with automated devices and vehicles.”
Noting that in meteorology and communications “satellites have already entered solidly into the area of economic usefulness,” report recommended that NASA grant high priority to development of multichannel distribution system for public and private network TV; multichannel system for educational broadcasts in developing countries and for special interest groups such as physicians, lawyers, and educators; and North Atlantic satellite navigation system for traffic control of transoceanic aircraft and ships. Satellite earth-sensing was dependent on R&D in sensor signatures—form of information provided by instruments. Report recommended immediate pilot program for providing information in familiar and immediately usable form, exploration into use of side-looking radar, and start of 10- to 12-yr development plan for more sophisticated sensors.

There will be cases which remain unexplained because of lack of data, lack of repeatability, false reporting, wishful thinking, deluded observers, rumors,.lies, and fraud. A residue of unexplained cases is not a justifi-
cation for continuing an investigation after overwhelming evidence has disposed of hypotheses of supernormality, such as beings from outer space or communications from the dead. . . .

Mystique or no, it is still difficult to comprehend what drove the early aeronauts to attempt feats which most often won them the contempt and ridicule of their countrymen.” (W Post, 2/18/69, B4)
February 19: Dr. Lee A.

money on urban programs as we did, say, on the atomic bomb project or on our space program, we could quickly solve the crisis in our cities. But let us not forget that we launched the Manhattan project and the space program only after, and not before . . . efforts in basic research over the previous 30 or 40 years had uncovered the knowledge which showed us how we could build atomic bombs or launch payloads into space. Neither the Manhattan project nor the space program could have been dreamed of 10 years before they started, because we did not even know enough to even formulate a development program. Now, in many ... of our present crises we are in the same position as far as technology is concerned. We do not know enough about certain technologies and . . . many social phenomena to justify mounting a concentrated, technically based attack on these problems now. We must . . . greatly enhance . . . measures to relieve immediate suffering and injustice. But at the same time we must encourage and support new efforts to learn more, to extend our base of fundamental knowledge in science, technology, social science, so that we can move sure footedly toward long-range solutions.” (Transcript)

February 24—28: NASA’s Mariner VI (Mariner F) spacecraft was successfully launched from etr by Atlas-Centaur (SLV—3C) booster on five-month, 226-million-mi, direct-ascent trajectory toward Mars—NASA’s first of two attempts to conduct Mars flyby missions during 1969 launch window. Launch vehicle performance and spacecraft injection were nominal. Spacecraft separated from Centaur, deployed its four solar panels, locked its sensors on sun and star Canopus, and entered cruise mode, where it remained with all subsystems performing satisfactorily while trajectory was refined. Midcourse maneuver was successfully conducted Feh. 28 to ensure that spacecraft would fly within 2,200 mi (3,540.5 km) of Mars July 31.
Primary mission objective was equatorial flyby mission for exploratory investigations of Mars to set basis for future experiments, particularly those relevant to search for extraterrestrial life. As secondary objective spacecraft would develop technology needed for succeeding Mars missions. The 840-lb spacecraft carried six complementary experiments to provide information about Martian surface and atmosphere. Mission offered first opportunity to make scientific measurements on night side of Mars. Two onboard TV cameras would take pictures of Mars disc during approach with 15-mi optimum resolution and of surface during flyby with 900-ft optimum resolution. Infrared spectrometer and uv spectrometer would probe Mars atmosphere, and oc-cultation experiment would obtain data on atmospheric pressures and densities. Infrared radiometer would measure surface temperatures on both light and dark sides of Mars; celestial mechanics experiment would use tracking information to refine astronomical data. Sharp increase in data returns would be achieved over 1964 Mariner missions. Mariner VI TV pictures would contain 3.9-million bits of information; Mariner IV contained 240,000 bits in 1965. Mariner VI would transmit science data at basic rate of 270 bps and high rate of 16,200 bps before flyby; Mariner IV transmitted at 8 % bps.
Mariner VI was follow-on to 1964 Mariner/Mars missions and precursor to 1971 orbital and 1973 landing missions. First Mars probe, Mariner III (launched Nov. 4, 1964), had failed to achieve desired orbit when shroud remained attached to spacecraft. Mariner IV (launched Nov. 28, 1964) had transmitted first close-up photos of Mars in July 1965. Mariner VII (Mariner G) would be launched
March 24. Mariner program was directed by ossa Lunar and Planetary Programs Div. Project management and responsibility for spacecraft, mission operations, and tracking and data acquisition were assigned to JPL. Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle was managed by LeRC. (nasa Proj Off; nasa Release 69—26)

Main bottleneck was relative Unavailability of testing facilities. Central planning system in U.S.S.R. reinforced separation between R&D establishments and industry and contributed to reluctance of factories to innovate. Increasing use of contract system, with industries placing growing number of R&D contracts with institutions of higher learning, was helping bridge gap between research centers and industry.

President Eisenhower, President Kennedy, and President Johnson, each in his own way, had a major impact on aeronautics and astronautics. And for each, his support of aerospace was a function of his belief that such efforts were instrumental in the accomplishment of national goals. In the future, as in the past, governmental support of aerospace will be based largely on its demonstrated relevance to the needs of the nation.” (A&A, 2/69, 26-7)

Launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft, carrying Astronauts James A. McDivitt (commander), David R. Scott (cm pilot), and Russell L. Schweickart (lm pilot), entered initial orbit with 119.5-mi (192.3-km) apogee and 117.6-rai (189,3-km) perigee. After
post-insertion checkout csm, code-named “Gumdrop,” separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S—IVB) and lm, code-named “Spider.” Crew successfully transposed csm and docked with lm, and docked spacecraft was separated from 3rd stage with rcs burn. Two S—IVB burns placed stage on earth-escape trajectory. Crew conducted first docked SPS burn.
On second day crew tracked landmarks, conducted pitch and yaw roll maneuvers, and increased apogee by firing sps engine three times. On third day, McDivitt and Schweickart entered lm through docking tunnel, evaluated lm systems, transmitted first telecast, and conducted first manned firing of lm descent propulsion system (dps). They then returned to csm and conducted fifth sps burn to circularize orbit. McDivitt and Schweickart reentered lm on fourth day and transmitted second telecast. Schweickart, recovered from earlier nausea, spent 37 min outside spacecraft, walking between lm and csm hatches, maneuvering on handrails, and standing in “golden slipper” foot restraints. He commented on sun’s brightness, photographed spacecraft and earth, and described rain squalls over ksc before he and McDivitt returned to csm. Scott opened cm hatch and retrieved thermal samples from csm exterior.
McDivitt and Schweickart reentered lm on fifth day to perform csm—lm rendezvous. Scott separated csm from lm and fired csm reaction control system thrusters to place spacecraft about 3.4 mi (5.5 km) apart, lm dps was ignited twice to set up rendezvous, lm descent stage was jettisoned and LM ascent propulsion system (aps) was fired to set up conditions for circularization. Although problems were encountered with crewman optical alignment sight (coas) because of extremely bright reflections, radar and optical sightings backed up by earth tracking enabled spacecraft to dock successfully after being up to 114 mi (183.5 km) apart during 6%-hr separation. After McDivitt and Schweickart returned to csm, crew jettisoned lm ascent stage and maneuvered to safe distance while stage burned to propellant depletion and entered orbit with 4,309-mi (6,934.5-km) apogee and 142.2-mi (228.8-km) perigee. By end of fifth day 97% of Apollo 9 objectives had been successfully accomplished.
On sixth through ninth days crew conducted sixth and seventh SPS burns to alter apogee, tracked NASA’s Pegasus III meteoroid detection satellite (launched July 30, 1965), took multispectral photos of earth, tracked landmarks, exercised spacecraft systems, and prepared for reentry.
Final sps burn for deorbit on 10th day was delayed one revolution because of unfavorable weather in planned landing area, cm—sm separation, parachute deployment, and other reentry events were nominal; spacecraft reentered during 152nd revolution and splashed down in Atlantic 180 mi east of Bahamas at 12:53 pm est March 13, 241 hrs 53 secs after launch, within sight of recovery ship U.S.S. Guadalcanal. Crew was picked up by helicopter and flown to recovery ship within one hour after splashdown.
Astronauts were welcomed by Guadalcanal crew and received congratulatory telegram message from President Nixon which said: “The epic flight of Apollo Nine will be recorded in history as ten days that thrilled the world. You have by your courage and your skill helped to
shape the future of man in space. The three of you and the great team which enabled you to complete your successful mission have shown the world that the spirit of man and his technological genius are eager to begin an age of adventure, an age which will benefit all the people on this good earth.”
All primary Apollo 9 objectives were achieved and anomalies were not serious enough to alter mission operations or flight plan significantly. First manned flight of lm qualified last major component for lunar landing mission.
Apollo 9 was sixth Apollo mission to date and third manned Apollo mission. Earlier unmanned Apollo flights had yielded all spacecraft information possible without crew on board. Apollo 4 (launched Nov. 9, 1967) and Apollo 5 (launched Jan. 22, 1968) had both been highly successful, completing inflight tests of all major pieces of Apollo hardware. Apollo 6 (launched April 4, 1968), despite launch vehicle problems, had attained four of five primary objectives with spacecraft recovered in excellent condition. First manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7 (Oct. 11—22, 1968), had achieved all primary objectives and verified operation of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. Second manned mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21—27, 1968), proved capability of Apollo hardware and systems to operate out to lunar distances and return through earth’s atmosphere.
Apollo program was directed by nasa Office of Manned Space Flight; msc was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, MSFC for Saturn V launch vehicle, and ksc for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by gsfc under overall direction of NASA Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Releases 69-29, 69-33; PD, 3/17/69, 400)
March 3: Following successful Apollo 9 launching, President Nixon issued statement: “The successful launching of the Apollo 9 spacecraft marks another milestone in the journey of man into space. The hopes and prayers of mankind go with Col. James A. McDivitt, Col. David R. Scott, and Mr. Russell Schweickart on their courageous mission. The genius of the American scientist and technological community, which created and designed the Saturn V, the command ship, and the lunar module, once again stirs the imagination and gratitude of the world. We are proud of this American adventure; but this is more than an American adventure. It is an adventure of man, bringing the accumulated wisdom of his past to the task of shaping his future. The 10-day flight of Apollo 9 will, we hope, do something more than bring America close to the moon; it can serve to bring humanity closer by dramatically showing what men can do when they bring to any task the best of man’s mind and heart.” {PD, 3/10/69, 356)

•	NASA Acting Administrator, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, testifying before House
Committee on Science and Astronautics on NASA FY 1970 authorization request, outlined goals in space and aeronautics toward which U.S. should move in next decade:
“First—We should do all we can to understand and put into early use the promise of space for people here on earth. We should increase our scientific knowledge of the vital earth-sun relationship and study the earth itself from space. We should develop and experiment with new and improved practical applications of satellites, particularly in earth resources. We should continue to foster prompt introduction into the economy of space applications and technology.
“Second—We should follow up the first Apollo landing with a sound program of manned lunar exploration.
“Third—We should proceed with the development and experimental operation of a permanent U.S. space station in earth orbit.
“Fourth—We should move out steadily in the exploration of deeper space, exploring the planets with unmanned probes and the sun, stars, and galaxies from orbital observatories outside the atmosphere.
“Fifth—We should provide the technology for developing the full potential of U.S. civil and military aeronautics.
“Sixth—We should maintain a strong momentum of broad technological advance in all aerospace disciplines.”
Although nasa’s 1970 budget was “ ‘holding’ budget,” Dr. Paine said request did include funds for starting three principal new programs: Earth Resources Technology Satellite Program, with start of erts A and b development; nerva flight-weight engine development, postponed from 1969; and series of planetary explorers for future flights to Venus and Mars.
In period of “retrenchment and declining resources,” FY 1969 operating budget was $762 million below FY 1968 budget and over $1 billion below FY 1967. Nationwide employment on nasa work had decreased from earlier peak of 420,000 to 270,000 at end of FY 1968, to about 215,000 at end of FY 1969, and under FY 1970 budget to about 190,000. (Testimony)
•	Apollo program after lunar landing was discussed by nasa Associate
Administrator for Manned Space Fight, Dr. George E. Mueller, before House Committee on Science and Astronautics hearing on NASA FY 1970 appropriations: “A thorough exploration plan has been evolved by the scientific community which will be initiated with the remainder of the fifteen Saturn V launch vehicles and Apollo spacecraft available under the Apollo program. Three initial phases of lunar exploration have been defined. The first phase will consist of landings that sample and observe the major classes of regions on the moon. To establish these norms, it will be necessary to land, carry out geological prospecting, and obtain rock and soil samples for return to earth from four separate sites. . . .
“The second phase would include the investigation of the major classes of lunar anomalies . . . volcanic types, sinuous riverlike channel-ways, fracture zones and impact craters. Six additional sites have been identified as the minimum ... to provide answers to basic questions about the moon and to evaluate locations of potential resources, building materials or underground shelter openings. The third phase would be to tie together this information from 10 or more sites by making a remote sensing survey of the moon from lunar orbit.”
Apollo Applications FY 1970 budget provided for “continuation of flight hardware development and for integration of modified subsystems into hardware for a set of five earth-orbital flights.” Their completion in 1972 “terminates the manned flight activity until other manned flight programs are established.” (Testimony)
•	Philadelphia Evening Bulletin editorial on Apollo 9 mission: “In the
first Apollo launchings, it was the taming of sheer, brute power that awed the on-looker.
“At the moment of ignition, it was not what lay beyond the astronauts that gripped the millions watching TV. It was the question whether the huge Saturn V booster would respond to command, whether it would hurl the astronauts into orbit or collapse, toppling slowly into a furnace of its own making.
“But with yesterday’s flawless Apollo 9 launch, the Saturn V booster seemed to emerge as a proven piece of space hardware. The preoccupation now is with the complexity, sophistication, the intricate workings of the most complicated of the several machines the United States has put together for the conquest of the moon. ... In its sophistication and vulnerability, [the LM] is ... an extension of man himself.” (P Bull, 3/4/69)

From our highest civil service employment level of 34,126 in July 1967, the number of NASA’s permanent employees will have decreased by 2,526 to 31,600 at the end of Fiscal Year 1970. During this same period, 965 positions will have been established specifically to convert certain support service functions carried out under contract with industry to civil service operations. This results in an effective decrease in manpower of 3,491, with a reduction from our planned manpower of 4,374. We are planning all of these reductions in personnel by attrition. . . . This is becoming increasingly difficult since the rate of separation has slowed appreciably. . . .

•	Time magazine said Astronaut Frank Borman had amused audiences
during February 1969 European tour by claiming Apollo 8 astronauts deserved overtime pay because they had aged about 300 microseconds more than people on earth during moon mission. At NASA’s request, Univ. of Maryland physicist Carroll Alley had calculated effects on astronauts of phenomena described in Einstein’s relativity equations— time ran slower for object as its speed increased, and time accelerated for object as it moved away from body exerting gravitational force. Alley found Apollo 8 spacecraft speed was predominant factor when it was within 4,000 mi of earth; time slowed and astronauts actually aged more slowly. Beyond 4,000 mi, effects of earth’s gravity lessened as Apollo’s time passed 300 microseconds faster than earth’s.
Despite Alley’s calculations, said Time, Borman’s claim was valid only for Astronaut William A. Anders, who made his first space flight on Apollo 8. Astronauts Borman and James A. Lovell had been crew-mates on Dec. 4-18, 1965, Gemini VII, when time dilation effect was dominant for entire two weeks. They had aged less than those on earth by 400 microseconds. Lovell’s time also had been slowed during four-day Gemini XII mission Nov. 11—15, 1966, by about 100 microseconds. “Thus,” said Time, “during all their missions in space, Lovell and Borman respectively spent 200 and 100 microseconds less time than was recorded on earth—which means they were paid for more time than they actually worked.” [Time, 3/7/69, 42)

These three capabilities make man such a valuable element in space science and applications that we need to take advantage of him at the site of operations whenever this is feasible. . . . With the prominence that manned flight has gained, it is surprising to ■ realize that while 589 unmanned satellites have been launched, there have been only 29 manned flights, eleven by the USSR and eighteen by the USA.

• Dr. George E. Mueller, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, testified on Apollo program, space flight operations, and advanced manned missions before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight. He explained importance of lunar exploration and outlined plans for new space station.	■
President’s Science Advisory Committee had said answers to questions about moon “may profoundly affect our views of the evolution of the solar system and its place, as well as man’s in the larger scheme of things.” Fact that earth’s moon was largest in relation to its planet, Dr. Mueller said, “implies that the two bodies may have been formed in the same manner at the same time. If true, the moon may be a book containing the secret of the earth’s first billion years of life. This record is lost on the earth which is subjected to . . . erosion by atmosphere and water. ... By comparing similarities and contrasting differences, man may be able to arrive at a greater understanding of the fundamental processes that affect the earth; for example, the mechanisms that cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and the processes responsible for concentrating ore deposits. The orbits of Apollo 8 and the Lunar Orbiters were disturbed by mass concentrations beneath the circular lunar seas. These may be huge meteors that struck the moon with such force that they melted and sank into the interior, or they may be iron deposits.
“Another objective of lunar exploration is to learn about man as a space explorer—his capabilities and limitations. Some day man will move on to other planets; the moon is a training ground. . . . We don’t have the basic information which early lunar landings will furnish and we can only speculate today about the feasibility of the moon as a base for an observatory or a permanent science station—about exploiting its environment of low gravity and high vacuum—about its potential for natural resources. ... A long-range goal like the lunar base would direct technological advances, stimulate public interest, and attain subsidiary objectives with earth application such as food synthesis, environmental control, and recovery of useful elements from rock.”
Within new program category, Space Flight Operations, nasa was bypassing intermediate space station, launch vehicles, and logistic craft and proposing to move directly to new, semipermanent space station and low-cost earth-to-orbit transportation system. Space station “should be in being by the mid-1970s.” With FY 1969 funds, contractor defi-
nition efforts were being initiated. FY 1970 funds would continue definition, preliminary design, and supporting work.
Dr. Mueller described space complex 200 to 300 mi above earth planned for 10 yrs’ continuous operation and adaptable for crew size, additional laboratory facilities, or other special-purpose equipment through selection, design, and arrangement of component modules. Crew would rotate at three- to six-month intervals, ferried between station and earth by reusable shuttles. Station’s electric power would come from solar panels or small nuclear generator.

•	Lee R. Scherer, Director of NASA’s Apollo Lunar Exploration Office, testi-
fying on FY 1970 budget request before Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, described extravehicular activity (eva) planned for first lunar landing.
Emerging on lunar surface, astronaut would acquire and seal bagful of surface material and place it in spacesuit pocket, inspect lm, and with geological tools, fill large sample container. Location would be photographed before and after sampling. Passive seismometer would be emplaced to measure “moonquakes” and permit estimates of moon’s internal structure for comparison with that of earth. Instrument, operated on solar power, would record and transmit lunar data to earth for about one year. Laser retroreflector would be emplaced to permit measurement of earth-to-moon distance and monitoring of distance variation. Measurements would be repeated several times daily for year or more and precise times determined by atomic clock. From data on relative motion of moon and earth and of each about own center of gravity, scientists could refine “knowledge of size and shape of the Moon, detect small movements that may occur between the Earth’s continents, and perhaps even test gravitational theories.” If time permitted, second sample return container would be filled more selectively, with greater effort to document and to pack samples individually.

•	Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator-designate, discussed possibility
of integrated European space program alongside that of U.S. and U.S.S.R. in Thomas A. Edison Memorial Lecture at Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. “The space-age challenge to Europe in my view is to find new ways of organizing and managing the great wealth of that continent to overtake, if you like, major American and Soviet space and other programs. This is the space-age challenge to Europe: not the ‘technology gap’ but the ‘management gap.’ ”
Dr. Paine also said, if 1969, 1971, and 1973 space probes should find “very exciting things about Mars, it is possible that we or the Russians might want to move a manned interplanetary expedition to a higher order of national priority. At the present time, the best guess is that this would not take place until the mid 1980’s but new priorities might lengthen or shorten this period.”
In reply to question on man-in-space justification, he said: “For almost any simple specific experiment ... an automated probe can be developed to do it at lower cost. The basic question here is the difference between short-range research projects to achieve simple specific objectives, and complex research aimed at developing general
exploratory capability and broad technological positions which will let you do things in the future which you can’t yet fully foresee. For the latter you will need men.”
Dr. Paine expected U.S.S.R. “very likely” would put space station into orbit before U.S. In lunar exploration, he expected U.S. to stay ahead a while. In planetary probes, he expected U.S.S.R. to stay ahead. In earth applications, he expected U.S. to stay ahead. (Text)
•	Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force and former NASA
Associate and Deputy Administrator, delivered 1969 Minta Martin Lecture at MIT as 1968—69 Jerome Hunsaker Professor of Aeronau-• tical Engineering. Describing origins and development of U.S. space program as well as decision-making and implementation in commitment to manned lunar landing, paper would be presented also at Univ. of Maryland March 20 and at LeRC April 24.
Citing need for set of national goals, Dr. Seamans defined national agenda for allocation of R&D that might be acceptable to man in street: understanding, forecasting, and controlling environment; supplying basic resources of food, fuel, minerals, and water; improving quality of life; improving transportation; improving communications; encouraging economic growth; and assisting international development and providing national security.
Space program contributed to all categories. Studies of sun’s transmissions, of Mars and Venus atmospheres, of moon’s origin, and of earth itself contributed to understanding of environment for practical use of man. Space R&D might aid search for alternative basic resources; it could establish facilities for detecting available resources and speed communications to meet problems. Biological and medical investigations in space program held greatest promise in study of reactions of biological specimens, animals, and man. Impact on education had been cited by some as greatest value of space exploration. Program had required in-depth investigation of waste management, fire prevention, materials development, and microminiaturization. Space technology influenced new vehicles being tested for transportation—hydrofoil ships, surface-effect and air-cushion vehicles, high-speed trains, electric cars, vtol and v/stol aircraft, jumbo subsonic aircraft, and supersonic aircraft.
Communications satellites, already in commercial use, ultimately could broadcast directly to home receivers. In international cooperation, NASA was working with 64 nations in space activity. Returns from NASA’s scientific satellites and communications satellites, development of manned space flight capability, and tracking facilities contributed to national defense. (Text)

March 12: Lunar Science Institute and Msc’s Lunar Receiving Laboratory
were preparing for “lunar knowledge explosion” expected to follow first manned lunar landing, Washington Evening Star reported. Laboratory would quarantine astronauts and lunar samples brought back from landing, storing samples for study and distribution to scientists. Institute, funded by NASA and administered through nas by Rice Univ., would facilitate lunar research by nonspace scientific community, Administrator Robert C. Wimberley said in interview. Directed by William C. Rubey, Institute was soon to be turned over to consortium of universities.
U.S. Public Health Service, nas, Dept, of Interior, Dept, of Agriculture, and NASA had planned 30-day quarantine and study of moon material and 21-day quarantine of astronauts. Samples would be sealed on lunar surface and would be flown from recovery carrier to Laboratory after spacecraft return. Astronauts were to be transferred from spacecraft into sealed van through plastic tunnel aboard carrier [see May 16]. Van would be delivered to nearest port and then flown to Houston to sealed-off laboratory. Objective was to prevent importing viruses, some of which had been known to survive thousands of years under unlikely conditions.
During three-week debriefing, crew would live in glassed-in quarters including medical area. Samples would be maintained under vacuum seals until opened in high-vacuum chambers containing remotely controlled equipment. Once photographed, catalogued, and processed, content and structure would be studied to determine composition and origins. (W Star, 3/12/69, A13)
•	nasa advocated “balanced, broad-based Planetary Exploration Program”
as “feasible and practical” part of U.S. space program, Donald P. Hearth, Director of Planetary Programs, ossa, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. Basic goals were to increase understanding of origin and evolution of solar system and life in solar system and understanding of dynamic processes shaping man’s terrestrial environment—“increasing our understanding of the planet Earth, how it has evolved, and how it may evolve in the future through a comparative study of the other planets in the solar system.”
Approach would be broad-based exploration of several planets—• Jupiter, Mercury, Venus—over period of time, combined with direct measurements of Mars surface in orbital and lander missions. Pioneer F and G spacecraft (planned for launch in 1972 and 1973) and new cooperative project with West Germany, Helios, would open “new era” in solar system exploration, studying effects of radial distance on interplanetary medium close to sun.

March 13: Shortly after Apollo 9 splashdown [see March 3-13] Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, told press at msc, mission was “as successful a flight as . . . any of us have ever seen.” It had “fully achieved all of its primary objectives and in numerical count, we accomplished more than the planned number of detailed test objectives.” Apollo program would move toward greater scientific content each mission as NASA developed its capabilities. “. . . we have been remarkably successful thus far in the Apollo program. The hardware has worked better than anyone should have expected, and better than any of us did expect.” Mission profile for Apollo 10, scheduled for launch May 17, would be released March 24 after careful evaluation of Apollo 9 results.
“We are doing the planning for ... 10 vehicles beyond Apollo 11.” After first landing NASA would stretch out flight schedule to allow time to make modifications and to understand results, with about two or three landings per year. NASA had equipment for scientific payloads for first four Apollo vehicles—of which two would land in lunar maria and two in highland areas—which would provide capability for later pinpoint landings at points of unique scientific interest outside Apollo landing zone. NASA would emplace on lunar surface network of 10 seismographs, series of heat-measuring probes, cameras, and other geophysical instruments to determine environment of lunar surface. Astronauts would wear new, “constant volume” spacesuits which would enable them to move around lunar surface very freely to conduct experiments. (Transcript)

•	Though “highly successful subsonic jet transports designed and manu-
factured in the United States are symbols of United States leadership on the airlines around the world,” Albert J. Evans, Director of Aeronautical Vehicles, NASA oaRt, told House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology, “both the British/French sst and the Russian sst are in flight test. Many short-haul aircraft used by United States commuter and feeder airlines are foreign aircraft and in the vtol and stol area the United States severely lags its foreign competition.” STOL aircraft were “within our grasp.” Two concepts showed promise, one for propeller-driven aircraft and one for jet-powered. Move to flight test in FY 1970 was planned. First was rotating-cylinder-flap STOL research aircraft. Second, jet-augmented wing, would be applicable to jet-powered stol aircraft. (Testimony)

The lead times are too great. The uncertainties as to the future world situation and the precise nature of future defense needs are also too great. I believe that the approach should be to consider carefully what our long-term national security posture would be ten to fifteen years from now if by then the United States has developed a space station capability and the logistics or ‘space shuttle’ system necessary to utilize it, and compare this posture to what it might be if we do not then have the capability, and the Soviet Union has developed and are fully utilizing such capability.” NASA planned to work closely with Defense establishment

•	First decade in space corresponded with early years of aviation following
Wright brothers flight at Kitty Hawk, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, told Annual Kiwanis Dinner in Milledgeville, Ga. “I recently calculated the costs per seat mile of their first flight for comparison with our Apollo flight to the moon. They probably had ten thousand dollars invested in first Kitty Hawk flight that went one fifth of a mile, giving a cost per seat mile for Orville of fifty thousand dollars. We will have about twenty-four billion dollars invested in our first five-hundred-thousand-mile trip for three astronauts to the moon, giving a cost of only about sixteen thousand dollars per seat mile. We are ahead of the Wright Brothers— but we have a long way to go to catch up with the DC—8 or 707. If subsequent flights to the moon cost two hundred million dollars each, that’s less than one hundred and fifty dollars a seat mile, so we are going in the right direction.” (Text)

•	NASA Science and Technology Advisory Committee for Manned Space
Flight, chaired by Dr. Charles H. Townes, published Proceedings of the Winter Study on Uses of Manned Space Flight, 1975—1985, Vol. I—■ Proceedings: NASA program for next two decades must project state of technology for that period. Program must be balanced in use of manned and automated operations. “The benefits to the nation, both internal and international, dictate that the United States remain in the forefront of all major categories of space activities,” space sciences, exploration of solar system, manned space flight capability, and economic applications of space flight.
Study said it was reasonable to use to 1% of gnp to support civilian space flight program of which major elements were: (1) aggressive-automated planetary exploration program as recommended by nas—nrc Space Science Board, with options for manned phase to follow early automated phase; (2) economic applications program as recommended by 1968 Summer Study on Space Applications by nas; (3) continuation of lunar exploration after Apollo landing as recommended by Lunar and Planetary Missions Board of nasa; (4) vigorous program of astronomical observations in earth orbit as recommended by NASA Astronomy Missions Board; and (5) extension of manned space flight capability in earth orbit to longer duration for scientific and technological purposes. Achievement of manned low-cost transportation system deserved high priority. Study recommended use of long-duration manned space station designed to support men in weightless condition “unless unexpected biomedical problems are encountered or overwhelming engineering advantages for artificial gravity are discovered.” It agreed on advisability of placing observatories and labora-
tories in earth orbit but noted, “Relative emphasis among these activities and the extent of manned attendance desirable in each, must be decided by appropriate studies and experiments.”
“To provide a focal point for structuring a manned planetary program a target date of 1982 and the Mars landing mode . . . are assumed here for discussion. Achievement of the operational capability in that year would require initiation of system design in about 1975.” (Text)

Volpe and they were included in report, (upi, W Post, 3/29/69, A2)
March 29: While Nixon Administration warned of $2- to $3-billion cut in FY 1970 budget, NASA was asking SlOO-million increase with good chance of approval, James J. Haggerty, Jr., said in Armed Forces Journal. “NASA officials report a generally warmer reception on Capitol Hill as a result of near-flawless performance on all of the manned Apollo missions.” Apollo 1970 funding represented penultimate installment on basic program and “Congress can at last see light at the end of the tunnel.” Most important, “extra $100-million is a real bargain price for the potential benefit. . . one of those deals that the buyer can’t afford to turn down. If you invest a hundred thousand in a magnificent home and the contractor demands another thousand to put a roof on it, you have little option.” Since U.S. had committed $25 billion to program, “it would be questionable economy to settle for less than maximum benefit by withholding what amounts to two-fifths of one percent of the total.” [AFJ, 3/29/69, 21)
March 30: Thomas O’Toole in Washington Post said plans for handling lunar samples [see March 12] had stirred bitter scientific controversy. Tests scheduled at NASA’s Lunar Receiving Laboratory would last at least two months while scientists waited for “the chance to study what amounts to a Rosetta stone that could hold the clue to the origin of life itself.” At close of examination period, NASA would parcel out moon rocks to 110 scientists from group of 600 and even “chosen few” had no guarantee of receiving piece of moon. URL official had explained that if NASA found, for example, that there was absolutely no evidence of radioactive argon, “It would be quite foolish to waste a sample on a man ... whose primary goal was to look for radioactive argon.” Scientists also were disturbed over involvement of other Federal agencies in lunar sample handling. (W Post, 3/30/69, Al)
March 31: Library of Congress Legislative Reference Service published United States and Soviet Rivalry in Space: Who Is Ahead, and How Do the Contenders Compare? by Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II, Senior Specialist in Space Transportation and Technology, Science Policy Research Div. By June 30, 1969, U.S. expected to have spent $50.6 billion on space. Because of greater weight of Soviet hardware, “one could assume that their program is at least of the same magnitude . . . and may be larger.” While “there is no reason to believe their total aerospace industry is as fully equipped as our own,” missiles in Moscow parades indicated existence of multiple design and development team for space work. Each country seemed adequately equipped with
launch pads and ground support. While U.S. had worldwide tracking system supplemented by ships and electronics-carrying aircraft, U.S.S.R. accepted “certain constraints,” relying on ships to fill gaps in tracking system. U.S. launch vehicles ranged from those lifting 20 lbs to Saturn V capable of 285,000-lb lift to low earth orbit. U.S.S.R. still used basic icbm vehicle introduced in 1957, with upper stages added to improve performance.
While NASA program was run on open basis, there was less “openness” in dod. U.S.S.R. “holds to a minimum advance notice of flights, limits information . . . but at least makes a prompt announcement, assigns a name, and gives orbital parameters” of successful launches. There seemed little difference between space programs “as to general purpose and direction.” Both placed emphasis on military, though little was known of Soviet organization pattern. All “reasonable analyses are fairly convincing that up to this time the Soviet Union has not placed nuclear bombs in orbit.”
In space applications U.S. “has held a clear lead from the earlier days.” U.S.S.R. “has made a greater relative effort in . . . flights committed to lunar and planetary work than the United States” but “has not gained as good results.”
In future programs, both nations “undoubtedly have to face hard budget choices before actual hardware can begin.” Soviet goal was “comprehensive exploitation of space technology including the exploration and settlement (where practical) of the planets, along the way exploring the Moon in great detail, and using Earth orbital stations for a host of practical purposes.” While large orbital station would be within NASA’s technical capabilities in late 1970s, beginning of such capability probably already existed in U.S.S.R., but “it would be risky to predict whether such a station will appear soon or only after some years.”
Cooperation of U.S. and U.S.S.R. in space already existed in exchange of information, treaties, plans for trading space-collected weather pictures, plans for joint textbook on space biology, and joint efforts in geomagnetism, but no assessment could be made of future prospects. (Text)

Cone, Jr., head of LaRc’s Molecular Biophysics Laboratory, discussed his discovery of intercellular linkages and its application to understanding behavior of certain cancer types. His basic research into effects of space radiation on body cells had enabled him to observe phenomenon in which dividing cancer cell appeared able to induce connected cells to divide by transmitting chain-reaction stimulation through thin linkage of cytoplasm. Networks of these stimulus-transmission bridges permitted continued division of cells and, in human body, might constitute basic mechanism for cancer spread, (nasa Release 69—45)

April 1969
April 1: Reporting findings from four months of Oao II data to 129th meeting of American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Univ. of Wisconsin astronomer Dr. Arthur D. Code said: “It puzzles me to see so much ultraviolet light from the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and so little from M81 because they are rather old ‘garden variety’ galaxies. . . . There is a possibility that we might have discovered an old quasar a few million light years away.”
Full impact of Oao II data would not be felt for couple of years. “Some theories on cosmology will have to be modified and others discarded. Practically all phases of optical astronomy will be affected.” Temperature figures assigned to young, hot stars with masses more than 15 times sun’s would require alteration. “These stars are considerably hotter than 20,000 degrees absolute. They are aging about twice as fast as we thought and are burning hydrogen at a very rapid rate.” OAO data thus far provided argument against steady-state theory of universe which maintained universe always looked same, from any point at any time, Dr. Code said.
At same meeting, Joseph Purcell, oao Project Manager at gsfc, said Oao II’s observatory control system had exceeded its pointing accuracy requirement of one minute of arc by factor of two. “A subsequent oao will be 100 times more stable.” (nasa Release 69—51; Lannan, W Star,

•	INTELSAT conference ended March 21 had made it clear “that Intelsat, in
its brief 5-year history, has been an extraordinary success,” wrote Robert J. Samuelson in Science. Its transoceanic satellites, transmitting telephone signals primarily, had tended to depress cost of communications by multiplying available channels and pressuring carriers to lower rates. Satellites had given “third world” nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, previously dependent upon “confused mixture of radio and cable channels,” chance to join advanced world’s communications system. Attendance of U.S.S.R. as conference observer was “sure sign” of INTELSAT success.
Soviet decision to join Intelsat might hinge on organization’s decision about its future. Issue was Intelsat’s formal structure and
problem was “determining how large a role the United States should play.” U.S. domination stemmed from its economic and technological power. U.S. firm, ComSatCorp, was made manager of Intelsat under 1964 agreement, to oversee satellite design, contract with NASA for launchings, and supervise operation in space.
Month-long meeting had not resulted in accord on even draft agreement. Europeans wanted to replace ComSatCorp management with international secretariat to subcontract technical tasks to ComSatCorp and other organizations as they demonstrated genuine competence. U.S. approach was, Why “tamper with a successful formula?” Fundamental issue lay deeper. “Technological superiority . . . creates its own foreign policy problems. America’s Intelsat partners are pushing for a Space Age which—if not truly international—is at least more multinational.” (Science, 4/4/69, 56—7)

April 5: nasa adoption of field sequential color TV system to relay pictures from moon on future Apollo flights was “solace” to inventor Dr. Peter C. Goldmark, president of CBS Laboratories, New York Times said. System, employing small revolving filter disc to inject primary colors in front of camera, had been rejected by industry and FCC some 15 yrs earlier in favor of all-electronic compatible system now in worldwide use. Advantage of Goldmark system on moon flights was ability to pick up usable color images under exceptionally low levels of light intensity—important where stars might be major illumination source. Images received from space would then be converted through compatible system for home reception. Dr. Goldmark said system might be “first technological breakthrough that is 28 years old.” (NYT, 4/5/69, 30)
April 6: In interview published by This Week, Apollo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman said many things could be learned from moon: “One ...

•	In U.S.’s Annual Review of National and Co-Operative International
Space Activities, Soviet Government report said Soviet scientists had paid “great attention” to developing methods of detecting signs of life on other planets. “With the development of space research, the problem of detecting life on the celestial bodies closest to the earth by means of space craft is becoming a priority matter. The considerable difference between conditions on the surface of the moon, Venus and Mars and those in which terrestrial life exists makes it necessary for us to extend our knowledge of the limits within which terrestrial life and life in general can exist. In this connexion Soviet scientists are investigating the possible limits of the existence of life. The absence of systematic processes for the movement of matter on the moon obviously makes active life on its surface impossible. On Mars, where free liquid water is probably absent, life is possible using matter transfer by frost, ice in the soil, water vapour and the wind. Examination of the temperature limits for the existence of life gives rise to a number of considerations which allow us not to exclude the possibility of the existence of life, in for example, the polar regions of Venus.” (Text)

•	Merger of military and civilian man-in-space programs was major de-
cision facing Nixon Administration, said Howard Benedict of Associated Press. Many observers felt it necessary because, under separate courses being taken by NASA and dod, costs of competing hardware systems “might explode out of proportion.” Congressmen had charged there was costly duplication in NASA’s orbiting workshop and DOD’s mol, both planned for 1971 launch, but with work on both so far advanced there was no turning back. Air Force Secretary, Dr. Robert Seamans, Jr., former NASA Deputy Administrator, had said any attempt to combine two programs “would jeopardize the returns to each agency and would ultimately increase the cost. . . . These activities require different equipment, different orbits and different timing.” nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, had said classified study to determine mol’s capabilities to accomplish NASA’s long-duration earth orbit objectives had shown extended mol “too limited to provide a significant, cost-effective step toward achieving NASA’s long duration objective.”
Many observers believed technology and information for building national space station housing military and civilian personnel might emerge from the two programs. Another possibility was use by both agencies of similar rocket and spacecraft on separate scientific and military missions with equipment standardization providing “considerable saving.” (Huntsville Times, 4/8/69)

April 14: NASA’s Nimbus 111 (Nimbus-B2) meteorological satellite was successfully launched from WTR by Long-Tank, Thrust-Augmented Thor (Thorad)-Agena D booster after three-day postponement because of fuel leak. Satellite entered orbit with 703-mi (1,131.1-km) apogee,
662.2-mi (1,065.5-km) perigee, 107.3-min period, and 80.1° inclination.
Nimbus 111 carried usa’s Egrs XIII (also called Secor XIII) Sequential Collation of Range satellite as secondary payload on Agena 2nd stage and injected it into orbit with 704-mi (1,132.7-km) apogee, 667-mi (1,073.2-km) perigee, 107.3-min period, and 99.9° inclination.
Primary objectives were to inject Nimbus 111 into orbit and demonstrate satisfactory operation of active, three-axis, earth-oriented spacecraft for at least three months and to acquire representative global samples of infrared spectra for vertical temperature profiles of atmosphere. As secondary objectives spacecraft would make global maps of radiative energy balance of earth atmosphere and cloud cover over at least one seasonal cycle; demonstrate feasibility of surface pressure and tropospheric wind measurements by infrared interferometer spectrometer system and temperature profile determination by infrared spectrometry; make global maps of earth and day-and-night cloud cover for three months from image-dissector camera system and high-resolution infrared radiometer; and demonstrate SNAP—19 system as auxiliary power system for three months. Spacecraft carried seven meteorological experiments—most ever carried on U.S. meteorological satellite—and was first capable of measuring emitted infrared energy that would permit inference of atmospheric profile on global basis. Interrogation, recording, and location system (1RLS) would pinpoint position of special electronic platforms on fixed land sites and moving objects such as buoys, balloons, aircraft, and elk in Yellowstone National Park.
Butterfly-shaped 1,269-lb Nimbus III was fourth in series of seven spacecraft designed to develop significantly improved meteorological satellite, prove applicability of instrumentation, and fulfill special data

•	President Nixon submitted to Congress FY 1970 budget amendments
[see April 12]. White House, DOD, and NASA released details. NASA funds were reduced $45 million from $3.878-billion Johnson proposal to $3,833 billion (recommended $3,716 in new obligational authority plus $117 million carried over from prior years).
Apollo Applications program would be cut by $57 million but new obligational authority of $46 million for resumption of Saturn V rocket production and $40 million for lunar exploration would be added, for net increase of $29 million in manned space flight funds.
Space science and applications would be cut by $41 million, to $517.8-million new total. Advanced research and technology would be cut $13 million, to total $277.4 million; and tracking and data acquisition, $20 million, to total $278 million. University affairs funding would remain at $9 million, technology utilization at $5 million, and NERVA funding under nuclear rocket program at $36.5 million.
Funds proposed for construction of facilities and for research and program management remained unchanged.
At NASA budget briefing, NASA Administrator Dr. Thomas O. Paine said: “The reductions we have been required to make will make necessary difficult program adjustments and will result in reduced accomplishments in many areas. However ... in a context clearly requiring that Government spending be held to a minimum, the Administration has recognized the importance to the United States of a strong and con-
tinuing program in space and aeronautics. . . . Last January, I characterized President Johnson’s FY 1970 Budget as a ‘holding’ Budget . . . deferring to President Nixon’s Administration the decisions the nation faces on the future of manned flight programs.” President Nixon’s recommendations, “if approved by the Congress, will ensure that the nation can continue a scientifically effective program of manned lunar exploration and avoid foreclosing our ability to continue large-scale space operations in the future by allowing the capability to produce Saturn V launch vehicles ... to lapse beyond the point where it can economically be resumed.”
dod spending was reduced $1.1 billion and requested new obliga-tional authority, $3.1 billion, including $51 million from MOL. Other science budget cuts: aec funding, $78.6 million; agricultural and natural resources conservation, $345 million; hew university facilities, $107 million; and nih, $47.4 million, nsf budget remained at $495 million. Nixon budget made available $92.7-million carry-over for SST r&d but no funds for prototype construction. Overall reduction in space and atomic energy funding was $140 million.

•	NASA noted new level of maturity in conduct of Apollo 8 mission, NASA
Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, Dr. ■Homer E. Newell, told National Space Club in Washington, D.C. “We got the feeling that the people . . . handling the operations had now a new tool that fit the hand.” Maturing of total space capability was seen in use of Pioneers and earth orbiting satellites during Apollo 8 “to keep track of what the sun was doing so that the directors of the Apollo operation could know what radiation conditions in space were relative to . . . crew safety.” Mission also used weather satellites and communication satellites, “not only to transmit pictures . . . but also as an integral part of the operation, to transmit data. . . .”
Asked NASA’s priority on space station versus lunar exploration in view of increase in funding request for lunar landing program, Dr. Newell said: “Now you have touched uppn what I think is going to be the most difficult question for the country to resolve in the months ahead.” There was general agreement that manned space flight should continue. Debate would be over whether it would be done by continued lunar exploration, earth orbital operations, or both. “Our own feeling is that the country ought to do both. Certainly after having put all the investment into landing a man on the moon and developing the capability to do so we must continue to explore the moou. And we cannot foresee any reasonable or rational national program in which we do not continue that exploration. At the same time ... we haven’t finished developing the manned space flight capability. We have got to . . . get that permanent foothold in space and that is where the space station comes in.” (Transcript)

April 21: NASA’s Explorer XXXVIII (launched July 4, 1968), orbiting at 3,640-mi altitude, had discovered earth, like Jupiter, sporadically emitted low-frequency radio signals, Radio Astronomy Explorer project scientist Dr. Robert G. Stone told 1969 spring meeting of U.S. National Committee of International Union of Radio Science in Washington, D.C. “In the radio frequency range below 10 megahertz, the Earth looks very much like Jupiter. This suggests that the same processes that account for the Jovian radio noise may also be active in the Earth’s magnetosphere.” Signals from both planets appeared sharply beamed or directed in narrow cone, were quite intense and increased in intensity rapidly when observed toward lower frequencies, and were impulsive, occurring in rapid but sporadic bursts.
Explorer XXXVlll also had revealed sun was more active source of radio outbursts in lower frequencies than expected, providing unique means of studying sun’s outer atmosphere to 36-million-mi distance of Mercury orbit. “Such information,” Stone said, “could shed further light on mystery of Sun’s part in cause of low frequency radio storms on the Earth.” Explorer XXXVIIFs four 750-ft-long antennas had provided most comprehensive and detailed measurements of cosmic radio noise at low frequencies yet available. Information was providing first low-frequency maps of radio emissions in Milky Way galaxy, showing that most radio emissions originated in plane or disc of Milky Way. Satellite had remained stable since orbit despite repeated movement and had continued to operate successfully. (NASA Release 69—57; AP, B Sun, 4/22/69, A6; O’Toole, W Post, 4/22/69, Al)

® Briefing on Apollo 9’s earth resources survey experiment [see March 3—
13]	was held at NASA Hq. Dr. Leonard Jaffe, Director of Space Applications Programs, stressed importance of satellite photos for earth resources program: “. . . we have taken advantage of the Apollo and Gemini, as we did with Mercury, opportunities to get pictures of the earth and its environment with cameras, largely held by hand, by the astronauts. These pictures have been a very large source of experimental data for our Earth Resources Survey Program.”
Advantage of using space for earth resources survey was twofold. One was “large view that it gives you of the earth.” Second was “ability to see the same phenomenon, or the same area of the earth time and time again, to be able to arrive over this particular spot on the earth periodically and observe temporal changes.” Apollo 9 experiment had obtained some 120 or 130 useful frames of multispectral data, all of which had been distributed to principal investigators for analysis.

go-ahead of the type given for the moon adventure in 1961. A case can be made that exploration of the planets is but a logical extension of exploration of the moon; that once the space frontier is crossed in 1969 everything else is evolutionary, not revolutionary. This sort of gradualism, which is analogous to a girl’s becoming a little bit pregnant, is just as effective in the long run as the flamboyant setting of spectacular goals, and probably a good bit more feasible in a time when there is already much grumbling about pre-occupation with other worlds when our own is in such a sorry state.” (W Star, 4/27/69, G4)

April 28: Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, testified in FY 1970 authorization hearings before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences that he believed “the greatest significance” of President Nixon’s decision to include in budget amendment amounts for continued lunar exploration after first Apollo landings and for continued Saturn V production was “that it recognizes the fundamental fact that the United States should not and does not plan to stop its further development and use of manned space flight.”
Early manned lunar landing would allow additional savings of perhaps as much as $39 million in amended Apollo budget. Budget included funds for improved scientific equipment for more advanced missions to moon and for limited Apollo Applications program. Fund cuts would mean some program reorientation as well as delay in Workshop, previously scheduled for mid-1971.
Amended budget supported continuation of plans for 1971 and 1973 Mars missions and first mission to Mercury in 1973, with Venus swing-by. In space applications, “where we are placing special emphasis,” Earth Resources Technology Satellite program would enable NASA, with other agencies, to test practical use of space to gather information on water levels, crops, forests, and other resources. “Despite
the sizable overall reduction ... we have not reduced the earth resources project.”
Budget included funds to proceed with nerva development and continued to give “high priority to our work in aeronautics.” New construction would include Aircraft Noise Reduction Laboratory at LaRC, “unique national facility for studying the fundamentals of noise generation and reduction.”
U.S.S.R. was continuing vigorous program in both aeronautics and space. “The Soviet commitment represents . . . the application of resources at about the same rate as that we have averaged in recent years,” with “significantly higher percentage of the gross national product.” Soviets were “proceeding in manned space flight programs directed both at sending men to the moon and at substantially enlarged and extended manned operations in earth orbit. . . . Automatic rendezvous and docking flights with Cosmos 186—188 and 212—213 and the manned Soyuz 4—5 mission in January, with manned docking and crew transfer, demonstrated the increasing Soviet capability. . . . They appear to be pointed to a future capability for assembly in earth orbit of large space stations and of manned spacecraft to send to the moon and beyond.” U.S.S.R. had “made attempts to launch one or more spacecraft to the planets at almost every opportunity—three or four times the number of attempts we have been able to make.” (Testimony)
•	Mascons might be excess mass deposited by water and supported by

Cal Tech scientist Kip S. Thoren suggested pulsars were subject to quakes which accelerated their pulsation. At press interview during annual meeting, he said pulsars’ insides were probably superfluids— more liquid than liquid—and were gradually cooling, with crust crystallization requiring adjustments. Adjustments, he said, would cause “pulsequakes” and could result in sudden speedups in pulsar periodicity.
Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Thomas Gold said observations of pulsars indicated they slowed down as they aged, with oldest finally slowing billionths of seconds per year until they reached periods up to almost four seconds. He suggested pulsar radiation might account for luminosity of whole galaxies and even produce all cosmic rays detected throughout universe, including earth.
Cornell Univ. astronomer Dr. Frank D. Drake, former director of Cornell’s Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory in Puerto Rico, said space clocks were emerging as practical scientific tools, especially in testing Einstein’s theories. Dr. F. Graham Smith of Nuffield Radio Astronomy

April 30: At ksc briefing on NASA FY 1970 budget for community leaders, ksc Director, Dr. Kurt H. Debus, said: “It is clear that we will continue the present pace of launch operations in the Apollo program until the first lunar landing has been accomplished. . . . The continuation of space effort, however, must somehow take into account the same constraints on Government spending which now affect the entire federal budget. . . . The total ksc budget is being revised from $455 million for all purposes to $410 million. I am taking action to accomplish this reduction without crippling the essential launch team capability or drastically impacting the local economy.” Savings would be effected by: gradual cutback in efforts of contractors supporting design engineering; phasing down of Boeing technical integration effort; deceleration of Apollo/Saturn V launch rate to three manned vehicles annually, reducing employment; and greater use of five-day week and two-shift schedule, permitting stabilization of employment level at 18,500 by June 30, 1970, instead of current 23,500.
ksc strength would remain at 80% of current level, with reduction in support and stage contractors. Civil service cadre would drop from 2,920 to 2,880 by June 30, 1970. Employment already had been frozen at current level.
Saturn IB Apollo Applications missions would require increased employment at Launch Complexes 34 and 37 in 1971, with estimated increase in contract jobs of 2,600 to handle nearly simultaneous or dual launches, ksc also would participate in earth orbital space station studies. (Transcript)

Flight, spoke before student seminar at California Museum of Science and Technology in Los Angeles: “Besides serving as a subject of scientific exploration for its own secrets, the moon may be an important base for outward looking space science programs of the future.” It might eventually support large optical telescopes. There was strong evidence “that the most ideal location for large radio telescopes will eventually be the far side of the moon. This may be the only place within our convenient reach where the earth, which will become increasingly noisy as a radio source, may be completely screened out. In addition, the lunar surface presents us with a very large stable base, with only 1/6 gravity, no wind disturbance and no atmosphere absorption at any wave length. . . . Another attractive possibility is to use stations on both the moon and earth as a radio interferometer baseline for highly precise directional radio astronomy.” (Text)

•	Data from Mariner V flyby Oct. 19, 1967, indicated Venus was layered
with deadly compounds of mercury, gsfc scientist Dr. S. Ichtiaque
Rasool said in interview. Although bulk of its atmosphere was primarily carbon dioxide, mercury and halides—reactive chemicals including iodine, bromine, and chlorine—had boiled off planet’s surface and combined to form clouds of poisonous gas and dust, often covered by water vapor. Findings, Dr. Rasool said, upset scientific notions of origin of Venus’ heat as “greenhouse” effect—which might be occurring on earth with addition of carbon dioxide to atmosphere through burning of coal and oil. Clouds of carbon dioxide were assumed to retain heat, but planet covered with four layers of heavily colored atmosphere would never feel sun’s heat. (Lannan, W Star, 5/3/69)
•	Basic research program conducted by Dr. Wilhelm Rindner had led to
development of cardiovascular pressure transducer, erc reported. Tiny device had been placed in arteries and hearts of laboratory animals to measure blood pressure while using 100 times less power than conventional devices. Medical team headed by Harvard Univ. cardiologist Dr. Bernard Lown, in collaboration with NASA, said device was significant advance in monitoring important blood flow changes. Eventually it should be possible to implant device in human beings to observe blood flow and pressure in persons suffering from hypertension and other blood pressure disorders, including heart attacks.
Discovery of properties of device was made during erc study of effects of pressure on semiconductors. Properties would also be important in space applications; sensing of acceleration already had been demonstrated, (erc Release 69—9)

May 5: At dedication ceremony in Houston for Apollo 8 stamp, Postmaster General Winton M. Blount said: “The fact that this is the fifth stamp the Post Office Department has issued commemorating accomplishments of the space program signifies the extent to which space exploration has captured the imagination of the American people. . . . The nation’s concerted effort to reach the moon and outer space reflects two traditional aspects of our national character. One is scientific: the search for truth, knowledge, discovery. The other is psychological: the strong urge for adventure—an urge kindled by the unknown. We are all ex-
plorers at heart. The space program has made an entire nation explorers in fact. The flight of Apollo 8 around the moon and back was perhaps the greatest technological achievement of man to date. Certainly it was the most dramatic.” (Text)

As payloads become larger and energy requirements become greater to move these payloads farther from the earth, the nuclear rocket will become a workhorse propulsion system. As we move farther from the sun or as the power requirements increase for the more sophisticated payloads, electric power generated from radioisotopes or nuclear reactors will similarly become more and more important.

Our problem will be to determine whether any illnesses that show up . . . are due to the stresses of space flight or to some micro-organism picked up on the moon.” Among difficulties noted during Apollo program were loss of exercise capacity for period after return to earth, motion sick-
ness in flight, and damage to red blood cells from atmosphere of 100% oxygen. Blood cell damage had been alleviated by addition of nitrogen to spacecraft atmosphere. (Huntsville Times, 5/7/69)

•	American Security Council published The ABM and the Changed Stra-
tegic Military Balance, U.S.A. vs. U.S.S.R. Although U.S. GNP ran almost twice that of U.S.S.R., latter was investing two to three times more in strategic military forces annually. Report concluded: “Antiballistic missile defense is not a cure-all for the security of the United States. It is not the ultimate defense system, for technology knows no limits and each decade produces fresh challenges and fresh need for response on the part of free nations. But anti-missile defense is an essential component in the network of military systems designed to give the American people a seamless garment of security in an age of acute danger. . . . We firmly believe that an American abm system is the soundest insurance for peace and against war that the United States can buy in 1969, for the 1970s. ... It may well be . . . the single most important step the United States can take toward a real and lasting peace at this moment in history.” (Text)

system prepared at his request by Harvard law professor Abram Chayes and MIT provost Dr. Jerome B. Wiesner and scientists George W. Rathjens and Steven Weinberg. It said that “the Sentinel/Safeguard anti-ballistic missile system should not be deployed at this time.” Recommendation was based on conclusions system was unlikely to perform according to specifications under nuclear attack, was susceptible to penetration, and was not well adapted to perform missions assigned to it. Deployment would probably start “new round in the arms race” and “seriously impede the conclusion of an arms control agreement.” (Kelly, W Star, 5/7/69, A8; Chapman, W Post, 5/7/69, Al)

Funding for this purpose is included as part of the budget amendment to the NASA request for fiscal year 1970.
“An additional item ... is funding for maintaining the production of the Saturn V launch vehicle. Although specific commitment to a particular mission or missions has not been made for the initial vehicles to be produced under this budget amendment, it was the judgment of the Space Task Group that this vehicle represented a unique and valuable resource that we would undoubtedly wish to continue to use, at least through the mid-1970s. Because of the long lead times involved in a vehicle of this size, action is necessary now if we are to have follow-on vehicles produced and available by 1973 and after.” (Transcript)

May 12—24: At 10th annual meeting of Committee on Space Research (cospar) in Prague, Apollo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman received medal from Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.
nas—nrc submitted United States Space Science Program, comprehensive summary of scientific research in space science in U.S. during 1968. “Although the principal concern of the space science program in the United States continues to be with the Earth, its environment, the Sun, interactions of solar and terrestrial phenomena, the Moon and planets, and the biological effects of weightlessness and radiation, there is a trend toward increasing emphasis on the use of space vehicles for stellar and galactic astronomy, especially in areas of the electromagnetic spectrum for which the atmosphere is essentially opaque. The successful operation of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory satellite and the rapid development of improved instruments and techniques for ultraviolet and x-ray astronomy . . . are examples of this trend.”
In interview with press, nas-nrc Space Science Board member Dr. Richard W. Porter said U.S. would probably have to review its expensive prophylactic measures in planned Mars landings if U.S.S.R. landed there first with same techniques and precautions used in Venus shots. Outgoing contamination of planets might well be bigger problem than contamination of incoming spacecraft. There was little likelihood of spacecraft landing on Mars and Venus and returning for at
least 10 yrs, Dr. Porter said, and risk from lunar bacteriological contamination was infinitesimal. But contamination of planets was serious problem because it could spoil man’s first chances to make a pure investigation of biological evolution elsewhere in the solar system.

holders in Washington, D.C., key goal of establishing global comsat system was “within immediate view.” When Early Bird [Intelsat /] “was launched just four years ago, there were only a handful of experimental stations in Europe and the United States. Today, there are 25 earth stations operating in 15 different countries of the world, with many more nearing completion. It is expected that a total of 43 stations will be in service by the end of this year and that 26 different countries will have direct access to all forms of high quality communications that the global system of satellites makes economically available to them.” By 1972 “there will be more than 70 stations operating in nearly 40 countries of the world, thereby making this high quality means of communications available directly to practically every nation on earth.”
At end of first quarter of 1969 1,209 full-time circuits were being leased, up from 777 at end of 1967. Leased voice and record tariffs published by international carriers represented 40% reduction in Atlantic and Pacific areas since advent of comsats. Transmission of TV via satellite increased from 225 hrs in 1967 to 666 hrs in 1968, with 40% reduction in TV rates. (Text)

May 16: U.S.S.R.’s Venus V planetary probe (also designated Venera V) entered atmosphere of planet Venus at 2:01 am edt and ejected instrumented capsule [see June 4]. Probe decelerated from 6.9 mps to 688.8 fps, deployed parachute, and transmitted data during 53-min descent through dense clouds to night side of Venusian surface. Launched Jan. 5, Venus V had traveled 217-million-mi trajectory. Tass said: “The instrument capsule was automatically jettisoned from the station before entry into Venusian atmosphere. The aerodynamic deceleration of the apparatus in the atmosphere began . . . and was accompanied by a sharp decrease in overloads and a growth of temperature on the craft’s outer surface. . . . During the 53-min parachute descent, measurements of the temperature, pressure and chemical composition of Venusian atmosphere were made. This information was uninterruptedly transmitted to earth.” Venus IV (launched June 12, 1967) had reached Venus Oct. 18, 1967; Venus VI (launched Jan. 10) was scheduled to reach planet May 17.

•	MSC announced revised quarantine procedures for Apollo 11 after land-
ing. To prevent back contamination from moon, astronauts would dispose on moon under containment conditions equipment exposed there; brush, vacuum-clean, and bag other equipment and clothing for return; prevent dust from being transferred from LM to CM; and continuously filter CM atmosphere during return trip to remove dust particles.
Under original plans Apollo 11 crew would have remained in cm after splashdown while it was hoisted onto recovery ship. After reviewing loads to be lifted in transferring CM to deck, reliability of shipboard cranes, and capacity of available load-limiting elastic tackle, NASA decided to retain helicopter lift used on previous Apollo missions. Crew would emerge from cm to raft, where they would put on biological isolation garments that would cover them completely and provide high-efficiency air outlet filter. Interagency Committee on Back Contamination—NASA, Dept, of Agriculture, hew, Dept, of Interior, and NAS—had agreed that helicopter lift, combined with other prelanding procedures, would provide maximum achievable precautions against back contamination, (msc Release 69—47)

May 17: U.S.S.R.’s Venus VI planetary probe (also designated Venera VI) launched Jan. 10 landed on night side of planet Venus at 2:03 am edt, 186.4 mi (300 km) from Venus V after 51-min descent [see June 4].
Tass said landing of both probes “was accomplished with tremendous precision.” Throughout flight “the necessary temperature in the compartments and the permanent orientation of solar batteries on the Sun were ensured. During radio communication sessions the direc-
tional parabolic antennae were oriented on Earth. As envisaged by plan, the detachable capsules of both stations descended through the planet’s atmosphere on its night side. In the course of descent, scientific equipment measured the chemical composition, pressure, density and temperature of the planet’s atmosphere. Experts analysed the graph of temperature and pressure changes while the apparatus was approaching . . . and found in it a resemblance with the . . . picture of the landing of Venera 5. The apparatus performed with the same precision all major operations of the landing.” (SBD, 5/20/69, 84; AP, W Post, 5/18/69; upi, W Star, 5/18/69, A9)
• Apollo 10 astronauts would each carry out about two hours of head exercises early in mission in attempt to prevent motion sickness which plagued previous Apollo astronauts, msc Deputy Director of Medical Operations, Dr. A. Duane Catterson, said. Exercises—which included nodding, rocking, and twisting head—would be done to point just below threshold of illness until normal adaptation occurred. Since pilots who regularly performed drastic maneuvers in aircraft seldom suffered motion sickness, astronauts had flown aerobatic jet flights in barrel rolls and high-gravity maneuvers during week before launch.

May 18—26: nasa’s Apollo 10 (AS—505), first lunar orbital mission with complete Apollo spacecraft, was successfully launched from KSC Launch Complex 39, Pad B, at 12:49 pm edt by Saturn V booster. Flight carried three-man crew and CSM—106 and LM—4. Primary objectives were to demonstrate crew, space vehicle, and mission support facilities during manned lunar mission with csm and lm and to evaluate lm performance in cislunar and lunar environment.
Launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft—carrying Astronauts Thomas P. Stafford (commander), John W. Young (cm pilot), and Eugene A. Cernan (lm pilot)—entered initial parking orbit with 118.1-mi (189.9-km) apogee and 114.6-mi (184.4-km) perigee. Checkout followed lunar trajectory insertion; then csm, code-named Charlie Brown, separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S—IVB) and lm, codenamed Snoopy. Crew successfully transposed csm and docked with lm. Excellent quality color TV coverage of docking sequences was transmitted to Goldstone tracking station and seen on worldwide commercial TV. Crew extracted lm from S—IVB and conducted 1st sps burn. All launch vehicle safing activities were performed as scheduled and successful propellant dump provided impulse to S—IVB for slingshot maneuver to earth-escape velocity.
On second day, first midcourse maneuver was not required. Crew conducted midcourse maneuver number two, which was so accurate that third and fourth maneuvers were canceled. Five color TV transmissions totaling 72 min and showing excellent views of receding earth and spacecraft were made during translunar coast. Spacecraft entered moon’s sphere of influence on fourth day, May 21, at 61:50 get. Crew conducted first lunar orbit insertion maneuver with 356-sec sps burn to reduce speed to 5,474 fps and place spacecraft in initial lunar orbit with 196.1-mi (315.5-km) apolune and 68.6-mi (110.4-km) perilune. Second loi maneuver, 13.9-sec sps burn, circularized orbit with 70.8-mi (113.9-km) apolune and 67.8-mi (109.1-km) perilune. Crew tracked lunar landmarks and transmitted 29-min color TV of lunar
surface. Cernan transferred to lm at 81:55 get for two hours of housekeeping activities and communications test.
On fifth day Stafford and Cernan entered lm and checked out all systems before firing sm reaction control system thrusters to separate csm and lm ahout 30 ft and again for 2.3-mi separation, lm descent propulsion system burn propelled lm to within 9.6 mi of lunar surface over landing site No. 2. Crew had no difficulty identifying landmarks and Stafford said, “It looks like all you have to do is put your tail wheel down and we’re there. . . . The craters [around No. 2 landing site] look flat and smooth at the bottom. It should be real easy” for Apollo 11 landing, lm crew took numerous photos of lunar surface and provided continuous commentary on their observations after cameras malfunctioned. Astronauts described volcanoes and light-colored craters that glowed as if lit by radioactive substance.
Crew conducted lm radar test during low-altitude pass which indicated 47,000-ft pericynthian (lowest point in orbit), dps phasing burn raised apocynthian (orbital high point) to 218.6 mi (351.7 km). lm descent stage was jettisoned and Res separation maneuver and staging were accomplished. Anomaly in automatic abort guidance system caused lm ascent stage to undergo extreme gyrations. By taking over manual control, Stafford reestablished proper attitude. APS insertion maneuver burn at pericynthian established equivalent of standard LM insertion orbit of lunar landing mission (51.8 by 12.9 mi), where lm coasted for one hour. Concentric sequence initiation at apocynthian, constant-delta-height maneuver, and terminal maneuver were conducted. lm successfully docked with csm at 106:33 get, after eight-hour separation; and lm crew returned to csm.
On sixth day lm ascent stage was jettisoned; its batteries burned to depletion and it entered solar orbit. Crew made 18 landmark sightings and took extensive stereo and oblique photos of moon. Two scheduled TV periods were deleted because of crew fatigue and crew rested and prepared for return to earth, sps burn at 137:36 get injected csm into transearth trajectory after 61.5 hrs (31 orbits) in lunar orbit. Maneuver was so accurate that two other scheduled midcourse maneuvers were not necessary. During return to earth astronauts made star-lunar landmark sightings, live color TV transmissions, star-earth horizon navigation sightings, and csm S-band high-gain antenna reflectivity test. Pictures of moon from receding spacecraft were spectacular. Scheduled 10- and 29-min color TV broadcasts of earth, moon, and spacecraft interior were later followed by unscheduled TV transmission, which provided beautiful pictures of earth and brought total color TV broadcasts to 19 transmissions totaling almost six hours.
On eighth day crew prepared for reentry and SM separated from CM on schedule. Parachute deployment and other reentry events occurred as planned. Apollo 10 splashed down in Pacific at 12:52 pm edt May 26, 3.4 mi from recovery ship U.S.S. Princeton 192 hrs 3 min after launch and precisely on time. Crew was picked up and reached recovery ship at 1:31 pm edt.
All primary Apollo 10 mission objectives and detailed test objectives were achieved. All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed according to plan, with only minor discrepancies, which were corrected. Flight crew performance was outstanding; all three crew members
May 18-26: Apollo 10, first lunar orbital mission with complete Apollo spacecraft, carried Astronauts Eugene A. Cernan, John. W. Young, and Thomas P.

Apollo 10 CM (at right), carrying Young, was photographed by the LM with Stafford and Cernan aboard, 60 miles above the moons far side. Craters below were unnamed.
remained in excellent health and their prevailing good spirits were continually evident. Accomplishments included evaluation of LM steerable antenna at lunar distances; demonstration of lunar landing mission profile; low-level evaluation of lunar visibility; inflight demonstration of Weslinghouse color TV camera; testing of landing radar in near-lunar environment; and manned navigational, visual, and photographic evaluation of lunar landing sites 2 and 3, and in addition other possible lauding sites in highland areas.
Apollo 10 was seventh Apollo mission to date, fourth manned Apollo mission, largest payload ever placed in earth and lunar orbits, and first demonstration of lunar orbit rendezvous. Mission acquired major quantities of photographic training materials for Apollo 11 and subsequent missions and numerous visual observations and photos of scientific significance. First manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7 (Oct. 11—22, 1968), had achieved all primary objectives and had verified operation of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. First manned lunar orbital mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21—27, 1968), had proved capability of Apollo spacecraft and hardware to operate out to lunar distances and
return through earth’s atmosphere at lunar velocity. Apollo 9 (March 3—13, 1969) had proved capability of manned LM to operate in space. Apollo program was directed by NASA Office of Manned Space Flight; MSC was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, M5FC for Saturn V launch vehicle, and KSC for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by GSFC under overall direction of NASA Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, (nasa Proj OH; NASA Release 69-68; W Post, 5/19-27/69, Al; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 5/19-27/69, Al; W Star, 5/19-27/69)
May 18: On nbc TV program “Meet the Press" NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, said there was possibility U.S.S.R. would land men and instruments on all planets before U.S. “The Russians have publicly
taken the position that they are extremely interested in landing on the planets, and . . . one of the popular songs in the Soviet Union right now is a song about little apple trees growing on Mars.” NASA felt with Apollo lunar landing “we are really taking a lead in the ability to operate on all other bodies. . . . the technology we are developing . . . is a kind . . . that would be required.” If July lunar landing succeeded, “we will have enough hardware for nine additional flights to begin the exploration of the lunar surface. In parallel with that, we see activities in earth orbit which will be the precursors to the eventual emplacement of a large permanent space station, a laboratory in the sky.”
NASA expected to find “surprising amount” to study on moon. “In fact, we have already radically changed our views of the moon just with the activities we have carried out in preparation for the Apollo landing. For example . . . men are beginning to seriously question whether there may have been water at one time on the surface of the moon. Indeed, whether the large mare areas, the smooth areas . . . may even have been the beds of ancient seas. As we get more and more familiar with the moon we realize how little we know about it. It will take those ten flights and many other trips to the moon before man really begins to understand his twin planet.”
Dr. Paine said ijsaf’s mol and NASA orbiting workshop were “two very different projects.” NASA’s was “longer range program aimed at a very substantial facility which would be really a university campus type of research station in orbit.” mol was “program that is well advanced, and is designed to find out the military applications of space.” (Transcript)

May 19: At dedication of Robert Hutchings Goddard Library of Clark Univ., Worcester, Mass., Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said: “I am for the space program. But I want to see it in its right priority: One which will let it continue into the future and not have to be cut back or abandoned because the nation that supports it is hobbled by internal disorder. And so, once the lunar landing and exploration are completed, a substantial portion of the space budget can be diverted to the pressing problems here at home. We should develop a plan for an orderly programmed exploration of outer space. But we no longer need an accelerated program. ... We should continue an orderly and rational space program for the advancement of man’s knowledge of the universe and for the considerable benefits it will bring us here at home.” NASA program “has been the first time, outside wartime, in which the nation has organized its scientific and industrial disciplines and techniques,
“Our challenge today is to use the same techniques and the same discipline: To lower the cost of production of home building . . . ; to develop command and control systems in the fight against crime; to apply the versatility of computers to education and worker training and the vital work of neighborhood health centers; to organize government and scientific resources to find new and cheaper ways to end the destruction of our environment. The American team of government, industry and labor has been able to achieve Dr. Goddard’s impossible dream: Certainly the same industries, the same employees, the same techniques and support can be applied to the urgent business here at home.” (Kennedy Off Release)

•	Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, presented paper “Space-Age
Management and City Administration” at 1969 National Conference on Public Administration in Miami: “Mobilizing modern science, technology and management to accomplish bold ventures in space is clearly far simpler than better organizing the extraordinarily complex human interactions that comprise a modern metropolis. NASA’s spectacular advances in space are undoubtedly exacerbating public frustration with urban failures, but . . . they are encouraging the nation to tackle its more complex human problems with greater confidence on a bolder
scale. If America can go to the moon, it can indeed do much better here on spaceship earth.
“NASA’s range of management approaches is nearly as broad as the range within an urban complex.” Urban manager, like NASA manager, “can and should directly manage only a limited part of the complex interacting human enterprise for which he has responsibility. For the important remainder he must structure a ‘Darwinian Discipline’ system to encourage essential contributions from industry, from universities, and from the entrepreneur, the free wheeler, the scientist, the brilliant innovator, the gifted teacher, and other committed individuals. . . . The greatest single achievement of the space age may have been the formation of NASA; the rest followed as the energies and talents of America were released and given direction.” (Text)

•	Philadelphia Evening Bulletin editorial on Apollo 10 color TV pictures:
“Of all the visions man sees from his new and precarious vantages in space, the most compelling is still the planet from which he comes. In the eye of Apollo 10’s color TV camera, Earth is indeed the fairest object, the ‘oasis’ the Apollo 8 astronauts saw last Christmas on Earth’s first manned mission to the moon.
“For a stranger entering the solar system from the outer reaches of the Universe, surely Earth’s mist-shrouded blues, browns and reds would be a goal to satisfy the utmost yearning. Set against the cold blackness of space, it would be a prize to draw bold and venturesome inhabitants of other planets across incredible distances. It would be a goal courageous strangers would endure incredible hardships to win. . . .
“The awe expressed by the intrepid Apollo 10 astronauts ... is further reminder that the greatest space prize presently within man’s comprehension is already in his keeping. And it is one to leave man wondering whether beings on other planets strive and dream as he does. For the moment certainly, it would not seem so. For what people on another planet could resist the vision in the eye of Apollo 10’s TV camera?” (P Bull, 5/20/69)

“as near as they will ever come to being in two places simultaneously— there in their own living rooms with their television sets before them and, at the same moment more than 22,000 miles away, observing the planet on which they live.
“What we saw with such marvelous cold clarity was, of course, a round and mottled swirl of blue, brown and white, a small fragment of the cosmos which until less than a decade ago had fixed absolute limits upon all of mankind’s history. Now suddenly we saw it as a unity, a whole, as the habitation common to all of us, just as it would be seen by a non-human visitor approaching it as the astronauts are approaching the moon, silent, mysterious and seemingly lifeless and motionless. The observer had to remind himself that this was indeed the earth he knew. .. .” (B Sun, 5/20/69)

“drifting junk” in space. “One notable sidelight to the Apollo 10 flight came in a report that the spaceship brings the number of man-made objects in space to 1691. Although the chance of Apollo 10 colliding with any of the objects is infinitesimal, it is significant that there is so much hardware floating around in space 12 years after Sputnik I. . . .
“U.S. and Soviet scientists should find ways of bringing back or destroying rockets and satellites and their separate components after they have become inoperable. If some sort of solution isn’t found, it may not be long before a tragic collision will occur.” (P Inq, 5/20/69)

•	aiaa submitted to President Nixon’s Science Advisory Committee The
Post-Apollo Space Program: An AIAA View. While “remarkable progress of the Apollo-Saturn lunar program has erased almost all doubt about man’s ability to travel in space and return safely,” program’s magnitude had overshadowed “very solid accomplishments” of unmanned satellites. It was based largely on technology available at its inception; neglected “growing accumulation of feasible, but undeveloped technology” in space vehicle design that could affect space transportation costs; and failed to specify goals beyond manned lunar landing.
Report rejected single national space objective for next decade. It recommended programs to determine man’s usefulness in space over prolonged periods and to reduce cost of manned operations and urged Government to give high priority to multifaceted applications satellite program. It urged planning and funding for communications data relay, meteorology data, earth resources data, and navigational aids satellite programs and “well-integrated inter-agency plan to develop data-management subsystems.”
aiaa considered Apollo Applications program and MOL of “substantially greater importance” than last four or five lunar landing missions and encouraged “their timely continuance.” It urged designs proceed for extensions of capability in aa and mol orbital hardware to permit continuation of manned orbital program after 1973, supported retention of at least one crew-carrying vehicle with increased capability for 1973—1975; encouraged early steps to commit to flight demonstration partially reusable low-cost space transportation system
for 1974-1976; encouraged accelerated study of space station hardware to succeed aa program and MOL; and encouraged early steps toward commonality of NASA and DOD subsystems. It considered “commitment to an entirely new station” was “less urgent than commitment to a new logistics system.”
aiaa recommended continued Apollo lunar program through at least two or three missions and then evaluation, as well as immediate beginning of “vigorous study and controlled funding” of advanced subsystems for 1973—1975 to permit continuation if early success provided support for extension. It recommended manned planetary exploration commitments await evaluation of current programs.
Search for extraterrestrial life was “perhaps the most exciting and spectacular of all space-science program objectives” and might well serve as one of “central themes for set of balanced space goals for the 1970s.” ( a&a, 6/69, 39-46)

Washington Post editorial: “The mission of Messrs. Cernan, Stafford and Young, as dramatic and daring as it is, is only an interim step between the first trip to the moon and the first landing on the moon. It is, however, a crucial step since any major problems in this mission or any major unanticipated discoveries about the moon’s gravity might well delay the ultimate landing. Because it is both so crucial and so risky, the Nation will wait with special concern when they disappear behind the moon for the first time this afternoon and when the lunar landing craft breaks away from the mother ship tomorrow afternoon for its descent toward the moon’s surface. The hope hardly needs to be expressed that these maneuvers, like those in the other Apollo flights,

will be executed with the same precision that marked the early stages of this trip.” ( W Post, 5/22/69, A24)
John Lannan in Washington Evening Star; “Where manned space flight once was fraught with fright and peril, it seems to have moved into an era of fun and games. . . . The astronauts have learned to fly their spacecraft, the ground crews to launch them and the Defense Department to recover them. What remains is to use this accumulated knowledge, and that’s what NASA is attempting to do.” It all pointed to fact that “space flight has come of age.” (W Star, 5/21/69, A4)
Marquis Childs in Washington Post: “When the moon landing . . . is completed the cost to the government will be just under $24 billion. The achievement represents an unprecedented orchestration of the resources of science and technology. The contrast with the failures here on earth to begin to try to cure rudimentary ills could hardly at this moment of grave uncertainty be sharper.” (W Post, 5/21/69, A25)
Christian Science Monitor editorial: Apollo 10 mission “has again posed the old, old question: If mankind can achieve so spectacularly in space, why cannot we improve matters faster here on earth? The answer, surely, is that it is simpler to mobilize the complex electronics and space-science gadgetry to rocket a spacecraft to the moon than it is to coordinate the manifold and conflicting human emotions, ambitions, and processes necessary for cleaning up the cities, thrusting the black revolution forward with a minimum of friction, and banishing earth’s pollutants. The earth problem is moTe complex than the moon problem. Yet success in the moon venture will offer assurance that the earth challenge can be met.
“So let no one call the moon venture a waste of ambition, treasure, achievement. The whole brilliant enterprise is immensely horizon-widening, thought-expanding.” (csm, 5/21/69)

a mistake to consider the space program itself as nothing more than a kind of inspirational stunt to show us what we can do if we really put our minds to it. The idea that once the demonstration is over, we should divert all of its resources to domestic problems is excessively simple-minded. Of all the resources that have gone into the space program, the money that is so much on everyone’s mind is undoubtedly the least critical. The major resources . . . are people and organization and a continuing process of research and application. These resources cannot be ‘diverted’ into new areas; nor can a program such as this

•	Terre Haute [Ind.j Star said: “In backing Columbus, according to
Samuel Eliot Morison, historian, Queen Isabella had two motives: To make a buck in the spice trade, and to open new territories for her Catholic missionaries. It did not occur to her that she was about to change the history of mankind. That is the way of most turning points in human history. The Manhattan Project which resulted in the atomic bomb was basically a defensive move against the danger of Germany’s doing it first. It launched the atomic age. Johann Gutenberg found a way to print with movable type for the simple reason that he wanted more people to read the Bible. He had no idea that he was introducing mass literacy. These great human adventures had two things in common: They were done for practical reasons, and most contemporaries said, 'who needs it?’ The space program began for practical, everyday reasons. Russia’s Sputnik scared the pants off most Americans. The initial goal of catching up with the Russians has been achieved, and this is part of the reason why there is now a slowing interest. However . . . this country now has the potential of changing the world. . . . The U.S. should continue in the forefront of space exploration, with a well-funded and stable program. Space should continue to have a permanent, though not extravagant, position in the priority of national goals.” (Terre Haute Star, 5/29/69)

•	Science magazine published letter from Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.),
Chairman of Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, clarifying his views on cost effectiveness evaluation of Earth Resources Satellite system. He reiterated opinion he stated in Dec. 1968 Earth Resources Satellite System report: “Precise determination of cost effectiveness at this early stage ... is not possible. . . . The magnitude of the economic benefits simply cannot be calculated in the absence of the type of data which the system is designed to produce.” Conclusions of studies already completed had constituted “strong evidence that precision was not possible. Yet, I am reassured by the fact that all such studies . . . have concluded that the potential economic benefits will exceed the costs of such a system by a substantial margin and some predict that benefits will someday .be measured in billions of dollars annually. It is my personal conviction that an operational ers system will ultimately prove highly cost-effective.”
Karth said he considered it “nasa’s responsibility to experiment with new space systems that appear to have potential, and to conduct the necessary research and development which will lead to a firm foundation for a subsequent determination as to whether operational systems should be built. In this context, I believe cost effectiveness is not an appropriate standard to apply in advance to NASA’s experimental work, though it is certainly applicable when the time comes to decide whether to go forward with an operational system.” (Science, 5/30/69, 1009)

During May: Space/Aeronautics said: “Reshaping of the budget, in combination with a flurry of new activity among NASA, the Air Force and the President’s in-house and specially commissioned science advisors, has left no doubt that the Administration favors continuation of a strong manned space flight program and a total space effort much more national in character than the current one. The latter point involves greater pressure on the Air Force and NASA to bring their future programs together, particularly in the space station and support areas.
“Although manned space flight was the clear victor in the Republican amendments to the NASA budget, the surgery on the unmanned sectors was artfully performed.” Although $41 million was cut from ossa, none of it came from Earth Resources Survey satellite program. Although $14 million was cut from oart, none came at expense of nerva program. Only notable individual reductions in areas other than manned space flight came in deferral of Sunblazer program, cancellation of Biosatellite-F, and deferral for one year of new Planetary Explorer project. In net increase in omsf, NASA essentially traded off slippage in AA program for resumption of Saturn V production and insurance that lunar exploration would continue into early 1970s.

•	Atomic scientist Dr. Edward Teller thought nuclear explosion on moon
would be scientifically useful, Associated Press reported after New York interview. Vibrations would be source of seismographic measurement for study of moon’s interior. “The best information on earth” came from nuclear explosions, “because the energy-generating event is confined very sharply both in space and in time.” Factors making moon extremely inhospitable to life—absence of air and water—were highly desirable to researchers, since “change that has taken place billions and billions of years ago is still visible today.” Dr. Teller also favored development on moon of research station powered by nuclear reactor that heated lunar rocks to high temperature and liberated oxygen for breathing purposes. There was probability rocks also contained water, which reactor could reduce to hydrogen and oxygen for making rocket fuel to power short-range rocket trips on moon and soft-landing interplanetary spacecraft. Moon’s environment might lead to advances in low-temperature physics and surface chemistry in electronics, which could result in development on earth of smaller, more
efficient, and more sophisticated electronic equipment, particularly for information-storing and information-reordering. (Nicholson, AP, W Star, 6/1/69, Al)

June 4: President Nixon addressed Air Force Academy commencement in Colorado Springs, Colo.: “A nation needs many qualities, but it needs faith and confidence above all. Skeptics do not build societies; the idealists are the builders. Only societies that believe in themselves can rise to their challenges. Let us not, then, pose a false choice between meeting our responsibilities abroad and meeting the needs of our people at home. We shall meet both or we shall meet neither.
“This is why my disagreement with the skeptics and the isolationists is fundamental. They have lost the vision indispensable to great leadership. They observe the problems that confront us; they measure our resources and then they despair. When the first vessels set out from Europe for the New World these men would have weighed the risks and they would have stayed behind. . . .
“Our current exploration of space makes the point vividly, here is testimony to man’s vision and man’s courage. The journey of the astronauts is more than a technical achievement: it is a reaching-out of the human spirit. It lifts our sights; it demonstrates that magnificent conceptions can be real.
“They inspire us and at the same time they teach us true humility. What could bring home to us more the limitation of the human scale than the hauntingly beautiful picture of our earth seen from the moon?
“When the first man stands on the moon next month every American will stand taller because of what he has done, and we should be proud of this magnificent achievement.
“We will know then that every man achieves his own greatness by reaching out beyond himself, and so it is with nations. When a nation believes in itself—as Athenians did in their Golden Age, as Italians did in the Renaissance—that nation can perform miracles. Only when a nation means something to itself can it mean something to others.
“That is why I believe a resurgence of American idealism can bring about a modern miracle—and that modern miracle is a world order of peace and justice.” (PD, 6/9/69, 797—802)

Russians now had rocket more powerful than Saturn V, which would allow direct lunar flight. “If this rocket is flown in the very near future—which it might—they may still have a chance of landing a man on the moon in the latter part of 1969.” As for Soviet unmanned lunar landing, Dr. von Braun said, “I think the Russians very definitely have the capability as far as their equipment is concerned to
soft land enough payload on the moon to take a sample of lunar soil and fly it back to earth.” (upi, NYT, 6/6/69, 18)
•	Tass released reports which revealed that neither Venus V (launched
Jan. 5) nor Venus VI (launched Jan. 10) had reached Venusian surface intact in May. Data radioed from two spacecraft suggested terrain was very uneven, with height differences of more than 50,000 ft. Reports also conceded that Venus IV, which purportedly had landed on Venus Oct. 18, 1967, had not relayed data from Venusian surface, but had apparently been crushed during descent by extreme atmospheric pressure. “The pressure might have pushed in the upper lid of the instrument department and affected the instruments of the radio complex,” Tass said. Data suggested that Venus V had descended over deep basin where temperature was almost 1,000°F and pressure was 140 times that on earth. Venus VI had descended over plateau where temperature was 750°F and pressure was 60 times that on earth. Since spacecraft had not been designed to withstand pressures greater than 25—27 times that on earth, they had not sent data from below 12 mi. (Sullivan, NYT, 6/5/69; W Post, 6/5/69, A25)

June 5—8: NASA’s 1,393-lb Ogo VI (ogo—f) Orbiting Geophysical Observatory, carrying 25 experiments to study sun’s influence on earth’s nearspace environment during period of maximum solar activity, was successfully launched from WTR at 7:42 am pdt by Thorad-Agena D (SLV—2G)	booster. Spacecraft entered orbit with 682.4-mi
(1,098.2-km) apogee, 246.4-mi (396.6-km) perigee, 99.8-min period, and 82.0° inclination.
Primary mission objective was to conduct correlative studies of latitude-dependent atmospheric phenomena during period of maximum solar activity. Secondary objectives were to search for celestial hydrogen Lyman-alpha radiation, conduct neutron and cosmic-ray observations, measure solar uv and x-ray radiation, make detailed observations of vlf radio emissions, and exceed one year of active, three-axis stabilization. By June 8, all experiments except one—Naval Research Laboratory’s x-ray spectrometer, which was expected to have humidity problems—had been turned on and were operating satisfactorily. Two 30-ft antennas had been deployed.
Ogo VI was sixth and last spacecraft in NASA’s ogo series. Scientific instrumentation for Ogo Vi’s 25 experiments had been provided by 10 U.S. universities, 1 foreign university, 4 Government centers, and 5 private companies. Ogo VI joined four other operational Ogo’s— Ogo I (launched Sept. 4, 1964), Ogo III (launched June 6, 1966), Ogo IV (launched July 28, 1967), and Ogo V (launched March 4, 1968)—which had provided more than 1.2-million hrs of scientific data on earth-sun relationships and on near-earth environment. Ogo II (launched Oct. 14, 1965) had been turned off in November 1967. Results from ogo program included: first observation of protons responsible for ring of current surrounding earth at distance of several earth radii during magnetic storms; first satellite global survey of earth’s magnetic field, resulting in proposed new magnetic field model

•	Investigating board headed by Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr., reported
primary cause of Dec. 8, 1968, crash of nasa’s lunar landing training vehicle (lltv) No. 1 was “that the vehicle entered a region of flight where aerodynamic moments overpowered the control system . . . such that attitude control was lost. The source of the control problem was not identified ... in time to add (use) a second control system which could have restored control capability.” Crash did not involve any malfunctions of systems. Adverse region of flight was entered because the aerodynamic limitations of lltv were not completely understood, wind conditions were insufficiently accounted for, and displays in lltv and support van Were inadequate for conditions. Board made 11 recommendations—including wind-tunnel tests to assess lltv aerodynamic characteristics—for improved safety, (nasa Release 69—87; AP, H Chron, 6/6/69)	.

Now there is a lasting excitement which will build to the big launch [Apollo 11] this summer and probably will linger for months or years. . . . History suggests that man, despite his obvious and obsessive miseries, craves something to lift him beyond himself. War too often has been one outlet. Americans in particular have needed a quest, across the mountains or the continent, into the sky and the sea, to the poles or inside the atom.” This pointed up “classic dilemma in presidential leadership.” Did national pride in space achievement and its technological and military benefits mean more to nation than plans for aid to education, welfare programs, or feeding the hungry? “It could be that the world’s ills are not too great to allow such dreams. It could also be that Americans cannot live without them.” (Life, 6/6/69, 4)	•

•	Catastrophic contamination of earth by returning Apollo 11 astronauts
and lunar samples was “extremely unlikely,” Philip H. Abelson explained in Science. “One argument is that a form of life adapted to the absence of H2O, O2, and organic compounds could scarcely be expected to survive on earth, much less infect earth’s creatures. The most compelling argument, however, is that the lunar-return experiment has been conducted many times in the past. It has been estimated that millions of tons of unsterilized lunar material have reached the earth as a consequence of meteor impact. . . . Sterile containment of lunar specimens during the journey to Houston is assured. . . .
“Procedures involving the astronauts are more controversial. Careful
effort to keep to a minimum the amount of adventitious material returned to earth is a substantial factor in the procedures that have been adopted. The astronauts face a difficult and dangerous mission. Were their procedures to be made even more complex because of panicky, last-minute objections, their chances of a safe return could he needlessly jeopardized.” (Science, 6/13/69, 1227)

New mascon was 2.8 times heavier than mas-cons associated with Mares Imbrium and Serenitatis on moon’s near side. If mare material was confirmed in basin, discoverers proposed calling it Mare Occulum (Hidden Sea). Dr. Campbell said they believed mascons explained moon’s entire “out-of-balance” appearance as seen from spacecraft. While some Apollo mission planners believed moon to be pear-shaped because of its effects on spacecraft, Cornell team believed moon was nearly perfect sphere. Mascons explained unexpected variations in lunar gravity which, according to msc officials, had dragged Apollo 10 off course. With mascons, scientists were close to answering question of origin of lunar seas, Dr. Campbell said, “But we haven’t quite gotten the whole story.” (Science, 6/13/69, 1273—5; Cohn, W Post, 6/14/69, Al)

•	Washington Post commented on DOD’s cancellation of MOL program:
“While few tears . . . will be shed for MOL, the process by which it fell from grace deserves scrutiny. Many of the suggestions for taming the defense budget have posited some kind of non-Pentagon review mechanism, either inside or outside government. Yet MOL lost its place not through such a review but through intense general pressure, which became focused inside the Pentagon upon this particular item. The choice of which project to save, which to sacrifice, was made by the military on the basis of an obscure bureaucratic struggle with high Darwinian overtones. Like the brontosaurus, MOL came upon the tougher conditions of a new environment and was found unfit to survive. This may be an effective way to exercise a measure of occasional control over a swollen defense budget, but it is a crude way and one not at all guaranteed to leave the right elements intact. Both the spenders and the critics ought to keep looking for a more refined and selective approach.” (W Post, 6/14/69, A24)

•	Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, discussed need
for improved manned bomber at joint national meeting of American Astronautical Society and Operations Research Society of America, in . Denver, Colo.: “Those who criticize the bomber as an obsolete system in the missile age are often the same people who refer to our alleged 4-to-l superiority over the Soviets in individually targeted warheads.” Ratio would be “nearly 1-to-l, with total payload running heavily against us, if it were not for our bomber force with its multiple weapons on each aircraft. If our bombers are to continue to provide deterrence, they must be able to survive an attack and then penetrate the ever-improving Soviet defenses. The B—52 is still a good aircraft, but the prototype was flying in 1952 and ths latest models were produced in 1962. An advanced bomber will take advantage of the many improvements that have been made in airframe and engine design. It would have short take-off and landing capability needed for dispersal and payload, structure, and speed necessary for penetration.”
In security terms, space age presented dangers, but also afforded opportunities for increasing strategic stability. “Each generation of space vehicles will provide additional improvements in our ability to monitor enemy activities. We are now working on a satellite early warning system that would detect missiles as they are launched from land or sea. With the aid of such a warning system a dispersed bomber force would be able to take off from its bases before the impact of enemy weapons, even if the time of flight of the latter were greatly reduced.” (Text)

June 25: NASA published Lunar Orbiter I Preliminary Results (SP—197), including assessment of lunar terrain and results of secondary experiments in selenodesy, micrometeoroids, and radiation. Launched Aug. 10, 1966, spacecraft had been first U.S. vehicle to orbit moon, first to obtain detailed photographic coverage of near and far sides of moon, and first to photograph earth from moon’s vicinity. Photos showed fractured and faulted lunar crust with mass-wasting where large boulders had tumbled into craters. Moon appeared to have been highly dynamic and affected by volcanic activity, but despite overall roughness, some photos showed regions of relative smoothness. Surface of far side appeared much rougher than near side with higher terra-to-mare ratio. Meteoroid sensors registered no impacts during mission, indicating meteor activity near moon was no greater than that near earth. Radiation dose rate during transit to moon corresponded to that produced by galactic cosmic rays, but dose rates as high as 70 mrad per hr and 7 rad per hr were experienced during solar flares Aug. 26 and Sept. 2, 1966.

Scientists would also record heart action and respiration, monitor circulatory and urinary systems, and observe performance on two behavioral tasks—short-term memory and eye-hand coordination. Some 80% of the experimental data would be radioed to earth by high-speed telemetry at rate of 22,400 bps 18—26 times per day. Spacecraft would be retrieved in midair or, off ocean surface after, reentry. Monkey would be flown to Hawaii laboratories, where scientists would examine him for changes in bone density, muscle tone, blood cell mass, fluid balance, and reproductive system. [See July 7—8.]
Biosatellite III was third and last spacecraft in Biosatellite series. Biosatellite I (launched Dec. 14, 1966) had failed to deorbit on command after three days in orbit because of retrorocket system failure and had not been recovered. Biosatellite II, successfully launched Sept. 7, 1967, and recovered Sept. 9, 1967, had demonstrated that plants required gravity to maintain orientation and showed effect of radiation on living organisms.

During June: nasa’s plans for two three-planet Grand Tours—8- to 11-yr missions to outer planets—were described by Jpl scientist James E. Long in Astronautics and Aeronautics. Envisioning 1,200-lb spacecraft launched by Titan-Centaur, Long described missions that had been identified and analyzed: four-planet missions, including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, from 1976 to 1979 (earth-launch dates), with 1977 and 1978 giving best combination of closest-approach altitude, flight time, and launch energy; three-planet missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto from 1976 to 1979, with 1977 and 1978 preferred; and three-planet missions to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune from 1977 to 1980. Long said, “The fortuitous concurrence of mission technology and experience suitable for the challenges of missions to the outer planets, with a unique outer-planet alignment in the 1976—80 period, should make exploration of these planets, as a class, a high-priority candidate for program support.” {A&A, 6/69, 32—47; nasa Release 69-84)

Two major complicating factors existed: “First nasa and the Air Force must overhaul their bureaucracies.” Second was “requirement for a compromise between military and civil needs.” While usaf needed vehicle which could be launched quickly in large numbers and carry sufficient fuel for extensive space maneuvers, NASA wanted larger vehicle to carry more people and large cargo volume.

Developing lunar landing technology was relatively easy. “The laws of nature which made it possible have been well known for a long time. The engineering skills required . . . were available and were brilliantly organized. Hundreds of thousands of Americans worked together to make this dream come true. They had faith and they had hope.

July 5: Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong (commander), Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. (lm pilot), and Michael Collins (cm pilot) held press conference at msc. Astronauts were seated 50 ft from nearest newsmen and were partially enclosed in plastic booth as part of plan to limit crew’s contacts during 21 days immediately preceding flight and prevent development of illness. Collins told press that from CM viewpoint, Apollo 11 should not be very different from previous manned Apollo missions. He did not feel “slightest bit frustrated” about going to moon without landing on it: “I’m going 99.9 . . . percent of the way there, and that suits me fine.”
lm flight plan would pick up where Apollo 10 left off with phasing maneuver, Aldrin explained. There would be number of “firsts”: “the ultimate test,” actual touchdown; 1/6 g environment; new thermal conditions; two-man EVA on lunar surface; sleeping in LM on moon; star sighting technique with alignment telescope on lunar surface; and powered ascent from moon with seven-minute engine burn. One of important early activities after exiting from lm on moon would be determining best pace for moving about: “. . . there have been several different techniques employed in the partial zero gravity training. And, it looks like you can walk conventionally one foot after another. It also looks as though you can do a two-footed hop—kangaroo style.” In
training in aircraft flown at 1/6 g, “a fairly rapid pace” appeared quite easy to perform. “It looks like we shouldn’t have too much difficulty in moving at something like 6, 8, or 10 miles per hour.”
Armstrong said crew would use “somewhat hybrid methods of manual and automatic” for descent to moon. “The predicted method at this point, although we have a great deal of flexibility and choice, based on the situation at the time, would he to maintain manual control of attitude and automatic control of throttle through the final descent from an altitude of somewhere between 500 and 1000 feet until such time as the automatic throttle rated descent was unsatisfactory, at which time we’ll go full manual on the throttle ... flying it in a manner like a normal vtol machine.”
Code names for cm and lm had been selected as “representative of the flight, the nation’s hope,” Armstrong revealed, lm would be called “Eagle” for U.S. national emblem, and cm would be called “Columbia” for U.S. symbol, statue on top of Capitol, and Jules Verne’s fictional spacecraft, “Columbiad,” which flew to moon 100 yrs ago.

July 7: U.S. News & World Report published interview with Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator. Apollo 11 lunar landing would be “culmination of America’s satisfying everyone that it is indeed the leading
technological nation that it thought it was before Sputnik blazed across the skies.” U.S.S.R. would continue to put great stress on space and move ahead steadily. “. . . there’s always the danger that we may feel we can relax now—having attained the lunar goal—and perhaps slack off. ... if we were not to start new programs now, I think the situation might well reverse and the Soviets might once again develop superior technological capabilities in space.” Space technology could affect future defense posture. In the past, “wherever man has flown farther and higher and faster, wherever he has developed new capability to observe from higher areas, to carry out operations in new media, this has had a major effect on the equations of international power. We’re quite confident that this will probably be true again in space.” Application of space to defense area was DOD’s job. “We do not consider Apollo applications as any kind of substitute for mol.”
Journey of man to another solar system was “completely out of the realm of possibility” for next generation; “but in the more distant future, if it were ever possible ... to control the energy of nuclear fusion and adapt it in some efficient way to the propulsion of spacecraft, it might be possible to think in terms of longer voyages to another star.” Fundamental breakthrough would have to be made.
Chance that life existed in other solar systems seemed “absolutely 100 per cent.” (US News, 7/7/69)

•	Newsiveek’s 42nd space age cover story since October 1957 contained
comments from “opinion makers” on Apollo 11 mission.
Dr. Robert Jastrow, Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said scientific basis for mission was to discover secret of
earth’s past through study of lunar rocks. Resolution of “cold moon” versus “hot moon” theory controversy—whether moon was formed cold, or cooled off shortly after its birth, or whether it was like earth molten or partly molten inside with volcanic surface—“may ride with Apollo 11.”
Southern Christian Leadership Conference President, the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, said: “A society that can resolve to conquer space; to put man in a place where in ages past it was considered only God could reach; to appropriate vast billions; to systematically set about to discover the necessary scientific knowledge; that society deserves both acclaim and our contempt . . . acclaim for achievement and contempt for bizarre social values. For though it has the capacity to meet extraordinary challenges, it has failed to use its ability to rid itself of the scourges of racism, poverty and war, all of which were brutally scarring the nation even as it mobilized for the assault on the solar system.”
Anthropologist Dr. Margaret Mead said: “This can be a first step, not into space alone, but into the disciplined and courageous use of enhanced human powers for man, ennobled as he is today, as the first men step on the moon.”
Philosopher Lewis Mumford said: “Space exploration . . . is strictly a military by-product; and without pressure from the Pentagon and the Kremlin it would never have found a place in any national budget.” Best hope was “that this colossal perversion of energy, thought and other precious human resources may awaken a spontaneous collective reaction sufficient to bring us down to earth again. Any square mile of inhabited earth has more significance for man’s future than all the planets in our solar system.” (Newsweek, 6/7/69, S, 60—1)

July 7—8: NASA terminated Biosatellite III mission to determine long-term effects of weightlessness on living organisms when Bonny, pig-tailed monkey on board, registered extremely low metabolic state and refused to drink water after receiving 10 emergency water commands. Spacecraft had been scheduled to remain in orbit 30 days after launch June 29, but monkey’s condition—as indicated by steadily lowering body temperature, reduced heart rate, shallow breathing, substantial periods of sleep during day, and general sluggishness—had declined steadily for several days.
Spacecraft separated and parachute deployed successfully, but recovery aircraft was unable to retrieve spacecraft in midair as planned because of clouds and rainstorms. Capsule was recovered from Pacific off coast of Kauai at 7:36 pm edt, minutes after splashdown, and flown to Hickam afb, Hawaii, laboratories, where monkey was removed from capsule immediately and given intensive care. Without
prior warning from changes in physiological parameters being recorded, Bonny died suddenly at 6:04 am EDT July 8. Detailed analyses of data would be made during next six months and formal report would be issued after Jan. 1, 1970. Despite curtailed mission, experimenters expected significant information.

Total effort would require 10 yrs, with plans for second portion to be based on information gained during first 5 yrs.
Report, prepared by nrc committee, said developments in computers
and satellites had made it possible “to advance toward the goal of accurate two-week forecasts and, eventually, toward intelligent modification of the weather.” Use of satellites such as Nimbus III, launched April 14, and expansion of other observing systems made it technically and economically possible to provide adequate global observations for long-range forecasts. Recommended test of global observing system would require 2 satellites with advanced instrumentation, nearly 1,000 balloons, and 135 instrumented buoys. Simultaneous cloud-cluster study would require 12 additional aircraft, several ground stations, and computer facility.

July 12: NASA program of returning man from lunar landing was based on conclusion there was no risk, Stanford Univ. geneticist Dr. Joshua Lederberg said in Washington Post. “We could not mount an effective quarantine against a real peril of global infection unless we were prepared to sacrifice the astronaut, which is unthinkable.” Arguments for zero risk were “quite persuasive”—lack of atmosphere on moon, “an absolutely necessary condition for life to flourish,” and fact that earth had experienced lunar material samples from secondary meteorites. Main purpose of quarantine was “to protect the samples from earthly contamination—not altogether successfully, in view of the exhalations from the landing rocket and from the astronauts’ space suits. It was then reasonable to add on whatever additional precautions against back-contamination were possible without impeding the mission.” Project had helped show lunar arrangements would be “quite inappropriate to a real risk, for example a sample return from Mars.” For Mars program, “we must learn a great deal more by instrumented observations left there, before we can begin to design the precautions needed for samples, or men, returned to earth.” (W Post, 7/12/69, A15)

Charles A. Berry, MSC Director of Medical Research and Operations: While 4,514 hrs of weightlessness endured by U.S. astronauts in space had produced no serious medical problems, on moon “we will be placing men in an entirely new environment.” After four days of weightlessness, they would step onto surface where gravity field was one-sixth that of earth.
At Mission Control Center in Houston, Dr. Berry would be watching Apollo 11 astronauts’ heart rate, oxygen consumption, and temperature of water that cooled spacesuits. Preflight physicals had enabled doctors to draw metabolic profile of each astronaut, including work capacity on earth at various heart rates, oxygen consumption, and body heat generated. “We know the heat production level which the portable life support system can handle without being overburdened. If it reaches that point for five minutes, we will tell the astronauts to stop and rest.” Because of spacesuits’ bulk astronauts would start with simple tasks and work up to tougher ones. Excitement could affect ability to sleep in four-hour rest period planned before lunar walk. “We might have to make a real-time decision on whether to give them a sleeping pill or perhaps a stimulant.”
Apollo had taught one “amazing medical fact—that the loss of red-blood-cell mass apparently is caused by a pure oxygen atmosphere.” Results of using mixed nitrogen-and-oxygen atmosphere in spacecraft since January 1967 Apollo fire had indicated nitrogen apparently protected cells.

Landing, deploying equipment, collecting and storing samples, and then lifting off “are not simple tilings to do . . . and doing it remotely is more difficult than doing it with men in space. I don’t think by any means impossible, but . . . the chances of being able to carry it out on the first mission are relatively low compared to the kind of probability that we would associate with our own landings.”
If Luna XV were able to successfully retrieve lunar sample, feat would be “significant technological step and one that represents a considerable degree of prestige,” he said, but “each country [U.S. and U.S.S.R.] will obtain its proper share of credit. . . . The first sample returned if it were possible to do so and the first man landing on the moon are significant events, each in their own right, and are to be treated as such.” (Transcript)

Then, most probably, our attention will filter back to the pressing problems on earth.” (Times-Herald, 7/15/69)
Milwaukee Journal: “Apollo 11 is providing insight into the meaning of life and the imperatives of human society. It is forcing us to face the grim paradox of exploiting human reason and the marvels of machinery to soar into the majesty of space while the world becomes fragmented into selfish national sovereignties—some armed, some arming, with the hideous capacity to end life itself.” (Milwaukee Journal, 7/15/69)
Denver Post: “The Soviet attempt to send an unmanned spaceship to the moon in advance of Apollo 11 is a bold bid to draw attention to Soviet space prowess. But even if it succeeds ... in mechanically scooping up samples of the moon and returning to earth, the Soviet project will not overshadow the American mission. Instead, the Soviet flight will serve to underscore the expensive duplication of effort created by the space race. If the Russians and Americans had cooperated, rather than competed, the risks and the costs involved in landing a man on the moon would have been far less.” (Denver Post, 7/15/69)
Washington Evening Star: Soviet Luna XV seemed strangely timed. During their Moscow discussions on space cooperation, U.S.S.R. President Nikolay V. Podgorny had not given Astronaut Frank Borman “slightest hint that the Kremlin was planning to send an unmanned spacecraft to the moon to coincide with the history-making Apollo 11 American mission.” Was it really possible “to work together in space exploration with a country that seems to be playing tricks with ours at a moment when we are engaged in a historic effort to land men on the moon?” (W Star, 7/15/69, A12)

July 16—24: Apollo 11 (AS—506) manned lunar landing mission flown by NASA achieved eight-year national goal set by President Kennedy May 25, 1961. On July 20, spacecraft’s LM—5, Eagle, landed on lunar surface and first man stepped out onto moon. Two astronauts performed assigned tasks on lunar surface before reentering LM to lift off from moon, redock with CSM—107, Columbia, and return safely to earth.
July 16—19: Mission began at 9:32 am EDT July 16, when spacecraft was launched from ksc Launch Complex 39, Pad A, by Saturn V 506 booster. Liftoff was relayed live on TV to 33 countries on 6 continents, watched by estimated 25 million TV viewers in U.S., and heard on radio by millions of listeners. Launch events occurred as planned and spacecraft carried Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong (commander), Michael Collins (cm pilot), and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. (lm pilot), into circular parking orbit with 118.5-mi (190.7-km) altitude. After postinsertion checkout CSM separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S—IVB) and LM Eagle. Crew successfully transposed csm and docked with LM, ejected csm/lm from S—IVB, and conducted first SPS burn. Successful propellant dump provided impulse to S—IVB for slingshot maneuver to earth-escape velocity. Translunar injection maneuver was so accurate that first midcourse correction was not required. Midcourse correction No. 2, at 26:45 get, was so accurate that third and fourth maneuvers were not necessary.
Crew conducted two unscheduled color TV broadcasts—for 16 min beginning at 10:32 get (taped for 11:26 get transmission) and for 50 min beginning at 30:28 get—and one scheduled 36-min transmission beginning at 33:59 get. Broadcasts were very clear and showed earth, onboard computer keyboard, and crew. At 55:08 get (4:40 pm edt July 18) crew began 96-min color TV transmission with excellent picture resolution, coverage, and general quality. Viewers in North America, South America, Japan, and Western Europe saw live pictures of csm and lm interiors, CSM exterior, and earth and watched crew removing probe and drogue, opening spacecraft tunnel hatch, preparing food, and housekeeping lm.
Apollo 11 passed into moon’s sphere of influence at 61:40 get, 214,546.8 mi (345,205.8 km) from earth, traveling at 2,990 fps relative to earth. Spacecraft entered lunar orbit with 194.3-mi (312.6-km) apolune and 70.5-mi (113.4-km) perilune at 75:56 get (1:28 pm edt July 19) after first sps burn. During second lunar orbit, live color TV transmission showed spectacular views of lunar surface and ap-
July 16-24: Apollo Il’s successful manned lunar mission achieved the national goal set eight years earlier by President John F. Kennedy, toko told Congress May 25, 1961: “I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning kim safely to Earth."
proach path to Site 2. Armstrong pointed out lunar landmarks and described unexplained glow near crater Aristarchus which some scientists believed to be volcanic activity. Second SPS burn circularized orbit with 75.6-mi (121.6-km) apolune and 61.9-mi (99.6-km) perilune. Aldrin transferred to LM for two-hour housekeeping, voice and telemetry test, and oxygen-purge-system check.
July 20—21: Armstrong and Aldrin reentered LM at 95:20 get and checked out all systems before fixing SM reaction-control-system thrusters to separate CSM and LM on far side of moon. LM descent-propulsion-system engine propelled lm to within 9.8 mi (15.8 km) of lunar surface. Because LM-powered descent maneuver—initiated at perilune of descent orbit—was about 4.6 mi (7.4 km) down range from planned position, landing point was also shifted downrange. During final approach phase, crew noted that landing point to which spacecraft

Johnson, and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew at Kennedy Space Center. In ksc Launch Control Center (above) mission officials relaxed after launch; left to right were Charles W. Matthews, nasa Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight; Dr. Wernher von Braun, Director of msfc; Dr, George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight; and l/g Samuel C, Phillips, Apollo Program Director.
was heading was in center of large, rugged crater with 5- to 10-ft-dia boulders. Consequently crew flew past crater to more suitable touchdown point by controlling attitude manually and adjusting descent rate and horizontal velocity. Officials later attributed change in course to malfunction in onboard radar and subsequent critical overload of computer, which caused warning alarms and could have aborted mission.
lm landed on moon at 102:46 get (4:18 pm edt July 20) in Sea of Tranquility, 20,800 ft west and 4,000—5,000 ft south of center of planned landing ellipse. Landing-point coordinates were approximately 23,5°E and 0.64°N and site altitude was approximately 8,600 ft below moon’s mean radius.
Armstrong reported: “Houston, Tranquility Base here—the Eagle has landed.”
Mission Control replied: “Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the
ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We are breathing again. Thanks a lot.”
Armstrong said landing area contained numerous boulders up to two feet in diameter, some apparently fractured by LM engine exhaust, and surface color varied from very light to dark gray. Crew immediately adapted to one-sixth (earth) gravity in lm and moved with ease. About two hours after landing astronauts requested and were granted permission to perform extravehicular activities (eva) on moon’s surface before sleep period—about 4Vs hrs earlier than originally scheduled.
After postlanding checks, Armstrong opened LM hatch, descended lm ladder, and deployed modularized equipment stowage assembly (mesa) containing camera, which recorded his descent to lunar surface. Aldrin remained inside LM and recorded Armstrong’s descent with 16-mm Maurer camera.
Armstrong took man’s first step on moon at 109:24 get (10:56 pm EDT July 20). Some 600 million viewers on earth—one-fifth of world population—watched live TV transmission and heard him describe feat as “one small step for a man—one giant leap for mankind.”

July 20-21: “One smalt step for a man—one giant leap for mankind." Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong (top left) descended the lm ladder to set the first foot on surface of the moon. Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. (bottom left), photographed by Armstrong, deployed the passive seismic experiments package, with the laser ranging retrore-fiector and the Eagle in the background. The lunar surface TV camera was in the far left. Below, the flag of the United States remained on the surface of the moan.
landing and subsequent eva because csm was not equipped to receive TV transmission. Armstrong said moon had “stark beauty all its own"’ like desert in southwestern U.S. Lunar surface was “fine and powdery” and could be kicked up loosely- “It adheres like powdered charcoal . . . but I only go jn a small fraction of an inch. I can see my footprint in the moon like fine grainy particles.” Armstrong checked EM exterior and reported penetration of EM footpads into lunar surface was three to four inches and that strut collapse was minimal. Blast of descent engine had not formed crater in surface and about one foot of clearance remained between engine bell and lunar surface. He reported only problem was seeing his footing in darkness of lm shadow. He emplaced microdot containing messages from world leaders, collected contingency sample of lunar soil near lm ladder, and reported that, although surface consisted of soft loose material, material six or eight inches under surface was very hard and cohesive. Rocks were very slippery, apparently because vesicles (pores) were filled with powdery surface material.
Armstrong photographed Aldrin’s descent to lunar surface at 11:15 pm edt and astronauts unveiled plaque mounted on strut behind ladder and read its inscription to tneir worldwide TV audience; “Here men from the planet earth first set foot on the moon July 1969, A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.*’ Armstrong then removed
TV camera from MESA, obtained panorama, and placed camera on tripod 40 ft from LM to view subsequent EVA, Aldrin experimented to assess mobility on moon by walking, running, leaping, and doing twofooted kangaroo hops between LM and camera. He indicated some difficulty in maintaining balance but said that his agility was better than expected and that he was able to move with great ease. Mass of backpack affected inertia and caused “slight tendency ... to tip backwards, If I’m about to lose my balance in one direction, recovery is quite natural and easy. You’ve just got to be careful landing in die direction you want to go in.”
Aldrin deployed solar wind composition experiment in sunlight north of LM and joined Armstrong in erecting three, by five-foot American flag on eight-foot aluminum staff. Astronauts saluted flag and then talked by radiotelephone with President Nixon at White House in what President called “most historic telephone call ever made from the White House,” President said: “Because of what you have done the heavens have become a part of man’s world. As you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to earth. For one priceless moment in

the whole history of man all the people on this earth are truly one— one in their pride in what you have done and one in our prayers that you will return safely to earth.” Astronauts saluted President and expressed honor and privilege of representing U.S. and world on moon.
Continuing eva, Armstrong collected bulk sample of assorted surface materia] and selected rock chunks, inspected lm, deployed passive seismic experiment package and laser ranging retroreflector, and collected two core samples and 20 lbs of discretely selected material. Throughout EVA continuous black-and-white coverage of crew activity provided live documentation, with telemetered data and voice comments. Lunar surface photography included both still and sequence coverage using Hasselbtad, Maurer data-acquisition, and Apollo lunar surface close-up cameras. Astronauts completed eva, transferred film and samples to LM, reentered LM and jettisoned equipment according to plan, closing hatch by Hl:39 get (1:11 am edt July 21). Armstrong and Aldrin rested inside LM seven hours and checked out systems.
At 124:22 get (1:54 pm July 21) lm successfully lifted off moon, after 21 hrs 36 min on lunar surface. All lunar ascent and rendezvous maneuvers were nominal. Eagle reported to Mission Control: “Eagle

IZVES7IA, MOSCOW, JULY 22, 1969
July 24: Welcome back to earth: Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. (left to right inside the mobile Quarantine facility), were greeted by President Nixon aboard the V.S.S. Hornet after their splashdown.
is back in orbit, having left Tranquility Base, and leaving behind a replica from our Apollo 11 patch with an olive branch.” LM docked with CSM at 128:03 get. Crew transferred with samples and film to csm, and LM ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit. SM reaction-control-system separation maneuver placed CSM into orbit with 72,0 mi (115.9-km) apolune and 63.0-mi (101.4-km) perilune, where crew rested and prepared for return to earth.
July 22—24: Crew fired sps engine at 135:24 get (12:55 am edt July 22), injecting CSM into transearth trajectory after 59 hrs 28 min (30 revolutions) in lunar orbit. Midcourse correction No. 5, at 150:30 GET, was so accurate that sixth and seventh corrections were not necessary. During 18-min color TV transmission, crew demonstrated weightlessness of food and water and showed scenes of moon and earth. Aldrin showed in-space preparation of ham sandwich and Collins showed viewers how to drink water from teaspoon and from water gun. Final, 12%-mm broadcast at 177:32 GET sent message of appreciation from each astronaut to all who helped make Apollo 11 mission possible.
cm separated from SM on schedule at 194:49 GET. Because of deteriorating weather in nominal landing area, splashdown point was
moved 247.4 mi downrange, where weather was excellent. Parachute deployment and other reentry events occurred as planned.
Apollo 11 splashed down in mid-Pacific at 12:51 pm edt July 24, 15 mi from recovery ship U.S.S. Hornet, 195 hrs 19 min after launch. Swimmers attached flotation collar and seven-man raft to spacecraft and helicopter dropped biological isolation garments, which were donned by astronauts inside CM and by one swimmer. Two other swimmers moved upwind of CM on another large raft. Postlanding ventilation was turned off and CM powered down, and astronauts climbed out and helped swimmer close hatch. Swimmer then decontaminated all garments, hatch area, flotation collar, and area around postlanding vent valves with Betadine disinfectant. Helicopter carried astronauts to recovery ship, where they entered 32-ft-long mobile quarantine facility (mqf) with recovery physician and technician. They were congratulated by President Nixon and Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, who were on board ship. Crew, physician, and technician remained inside mqf until it was delivered to Lunar Receiving Laboratory (lRl) in Houston July 27.
cm was retrieved, placed in dolly on board recovery ship, moved to MQF, and mated to transfer tunnel. From inside MQF/cm containment envelope, mqf engineer removed lunar samples and equipment through decontamination lock and CM was sealed until delivery to lrl. Sample return containers, film, and other data were flown to Johnston Island and to Houston for transport to LRL.
Primary Apollo 11 mission objective—to perform manned landing on moon and return—and all detailed test objectives were achieved. All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed according to plan, with only minor, corrected discrepancies. Flight crew performance was outstanding; all three crew members remained in excellent health and their prevailing good spirits and proficiency were major factors in mission’s success. Accomplishments included first manned lunar landing and return; first lunar surface EVA; first seismometer, laser reflector, and solar wind experiment deployed on moon; first lunar soil samples returned to earth; largest U.S. payload ever placed into lunar orbit (72,037.6 lbs at lunar orbit insertion); acquisition of numerous visual observations, photos and TV transmissions of scientific and engineering significance; and first operational use of mqf and lrl.
Apollo 11 was eighth Apollo mission to date, fifth manned Apollo mission, and first manned lunar landing mission. Mission acquired major quantities of data for subsequent Apollo flights. First manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7 (Oct. 11—22, 1968), had verified operation of spacecraft for lunar-mission duration. First manned lunar orbital mission, Apollo 8 (Dec. 21—27, 1968), had proved capability of Apollo spacecraft and hardware to operate out to lunar distance and return through earth’s atmosphere. Apollo 9 (March 3—13, 1969) had proved capability of lm to operate in space under manned conditions. Apollo 10 (May 18—26, 1969) had successfully operated complete Apollo spacecraft on lunar orbital mission and had provided major quantities of scientific and training materials for Apollo 11. Apollo program was directed by NASA Office of Manned Space Flight; msc was
responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, MSFC for Saturn V launch vehicle, and ksc for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by GSFC under overall direction of NASA Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 69-83K; NYT, 7/16-25/69; W Post, 7/16-25/69; W Star, 7/16-25/69; B Sun, 7/16-25/69; PD, 7/28/69, 1016)
July 16: U.S.S.R.’s Luna XV (launched July 13) entered lunar orbit at 3:00 pm Baikonur time (6:00 am EDT) with all systems functioning normally, Tass announced. Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of U.K.’s Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, said spacecraft was transmitting telemetry data but no photographic signals. (SBD, 7/18/69, 22; AP, W Star, 7/17/69, Al)
• In Cape Kennedy interview before Apollo 11 launch, Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew said, “It is my individual feeling that we should articulate a simple, ambitious, optimistic goal of a manned flight to Mars by the end of this century. Whether we say it or not, someone’s going to do it.”
After liftoff, Vice President told NASA launching team, “. . . all the time I was out there I couldn’t help thinking of you, the people in here and all over NASA who have done such a brilliant job in putting together the combined effort behind those three gentlemen who are off on this historic mission. ... I bit the bullet for you today as far as Mars is concerned. But on the other hand ... I may be a voice in the wilderness.”
In Washington, D.C., Senate Majority Leader Michael J. Mansfield (D-Mont.) told press, “I think we have a lot of problems here on earth that we must face up to and when we settle those we ought to consider future space ventures.” Senate Majority Whip Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said, “The Apollo program is for landing a man on the moon and exploration and should take another one to two years. I think after that the space program ought to fit into our other national priorities.” (Witkin, NYT, 7/17/69, 1; Transcript, Agnew statement to NASA launch crew; Unna, W Post, 7/17/69, Al)
•	At White House, President Nixon proclaimed July 21 National Day of
Participation. “Apollo 11 is on its way to the moon. . . . Never before has man embarked on so epic an adventure. ... As the astronauts go ... we on earth will want, as one people, to be with them in spirit . . . and to support them with prayers that all will go well.” All Executive departments and Government agencies would be closed and U.S. flag would be displayed on public buildings.
With many members at Cape Kennedy, Senate and House met briefly and conducted only routine business. Congressional Record was filled with comments on Apollo 11 and wishes for Godspeed to astronauts. (PD, 7/21/69, 997-8; CR, 7/16/69)
•	During CBS TV interview at Cape Kennedy following Apollo 11 launch,
former President Lyndon B. Johnson said, “If our industrial people, these great managers of industry, the laboring people of the country, the government, the scientists, all with the help of Congress, can get together and do a job like this there’s just nothing we can’t do.” To world’s ills, “we must apply some of the great talent that we’ve applied to space.” There wasn’t “a single thing that our country does,
that our government does, that our people do, that has greater potential for peace than the space effort.” (upi, NYT, 7/17/69, 20)
•	Between 750,000 and 1 million persons crowded Brevard County, Fla.,
to witness launch of Apollo 11, including 5,000 dignitaries headed by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and former President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy and 40 representatives of Poor People’s Campaign watched launch from bleacher seats with 10,000 guests including families of Apollo program personnel, while other representatives marched outside ksc. Paris Match had brought 105 European businessmen. Some 3,100 press members were at special stand. As Apollo spacecraft lifted from launch pad there was some applause, but most spectators stared in silence until Saturn V rocket disappeared overhead. Afterward many were caught in monumental traffic jams. Banana River, five miles south of Launch Complex 39, was clogged with several thousand boats registered from New England to Texas. (Greider, W Post, 7/17/69, Al; Weinraub, NYT, 7/17/69, 21; Lyons, NYT, 7/17/69, 21)
•	Apollo 11 launch brought mood of reflection across Nation, New York
Times said. Dawn was breaking in western U.S. when blastoff occurred. Workers in San Francisco’s open air fish markets stood in silence to hear radio report. In San Diego motorists crossing U.S.-Mexican border listened to countdown on car radios.
In mid-America, classes were postponed at Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., while cadets watched launch on TV. Cowhands at northern Wyoming ranch, inaccessible to radio or TV, interrupted work to honor Apollo 11. Ranch owner Dr. Oakleigh Thorn II said, “We feel so close to the moon shot out here, because we’re so close to the stars and sky.”
In Biloxi, Miss., harbor fishermen paused on wharf to hear countdown. In Tennessee, tobacco farmers listened to transistor radios in fields.
Washington, D.C., schoolteacher said, “The astronauts didn’t just go to the moon. All our minds went to the moon and intellectually man’s horizons have jumped leaps and bounds beyond the historical situation they’ve always been confined to.” (Fosburgh, NYT, 7/17/69, 1)
•	Worldwide audience focused on Apollo 11 launch:
At summer residence, Castel Gondolfo, Italy, Pope Paul VI asked for prayers for U.S. astronauts a few hours before launch toward moon.
U.S.S.R. radio and TV gave factual accounts of Apollo 11 launch but maintained third day of silence on Luna XV. Major Soviet news program at 8:30 pm Moscow time showed tape of Apollo 11 liftoff taken from live comsat coverage.
In U.K. TV viewers saw launch via transatlantic satellite. BBC scheduled live coverage through July 24 splashdown and would relay broadcasts to continent by cable. London newspapers frontpaged Apollo 11. Daily Express headline read, “Ho Hum—Anyone for the Moon Today?” over report on Telaxed astronauts.
Polish TV viewers saw launch via 45-min transmission directly from Cape Kennedy. Hundreds of Germans and Americans crowded Apollo 11 exhibit in Mannheim, Germany, department store.
Swedish TV viewers were advised by state broadcasting company not to turn off sets Sunday night—so they could be awakened for scheduled moon landing Monday.
Hippies in Iran held milk and honey pots in Teheran restaur ant to toast astronauts. In Egypt, Moslem world’s leading moon expert, Sheikh Ahmand Haredi said, “The Koran urges Moslems to look up from their earthly abode to what lies behind the moon and stars.”
Japanese department stores featured models of Apollo command module. In Greece, Aspis-Pronoia insurance company issued first outer-space life insurance policy, to cover Apollo 11 crew at $10,000 each. In Spain people called event most interesting since Columbus discovered America.	•
Israel’s state radio broadcast in Hebrew from Cape Kennedy while Israelis stood around TV sets and portable radios in streets. U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem opened Apollo 11 information offices. Apollo 11 reaction was “generally tepid” in Lagos, Nigeria. Radio Nigeria reported launch seven minutes into its morning broadcast. Later it became number one newscast item.
Most of Latin America missed launch on TV because of failure of Intelsat-111 F—2 June 29. Latin American newspapers and TV correspondents traveled to U.S. to cover launch and were reported to be outraged by absence of TV coverage in their countries. In Colombia, government asked TV manufacturers to put sets in all town squares. Bogota students would have July 21 off to watch lunar landing. (NYT, 7/17/69, 21, 22; Bishop, C Trib, 7/17/69)
•	Harry F. Guggenheim said in Washington Evening Star article that
rocket expert Dr. Robert H. Goddard “was to the moon rocket what the Wright brothers were to the airplane.” Guggenheim, administrator of Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics during period it helped support Dr. Goddard’s research, traced career of “Father of modern rocketry” from early experiments in 1908. Among Goddard’s inventions were: first liquid-fuel rocket, first smokeless powder rocket, and first practical automatic steering device for rockets. It was no wonder American Rocket Society had conceded to Goddard “the almost single-handed development of rocketry ‘from a vague dream to one of the most significant branches of modern engineering.’ ” He had left “testimony to the power of one solitary individual to effect change and to transform the future.” While Dr. Goddard had died without fame which had accrued to Wright brothers in their lifetime, “he died still believing that man would one day shatter the fetters of Earth’s gravity and stride majestically into the vast reaches of space. I wish he were here now to share this moment. It belongs to him.” (AP, W Star, 7/16/69, A15)
•	As part of NASA and Washington National Gallery of Art program, Eye-
witness to Space, group of artists attended Apollo 11 launch to paint facets of mission. Program originated in 1963 when artists were invited to cover Mercury 9 mission. Among those commissioned to record Apollo 11 were Peter Hurd, Robert Rauschenberg, Lamar Dodd, and James B. Wyeth. Since program started, 25 artists had produced more than 500 sketches and paintings. (Casey, W Post, 7/13/69, Gl; Hicks, NYT, 7/15/69, 33; W Star, 7/17/69, A12)
•	Apollo 11 was producing noticeable effect on business and consumer
products, Washington Post said. Snoopy the Astronaut dolls were selling out; sales of color TV sets had risen in some stores; and sales of “moon maps and globes, as well as toy rocket ships and lunar exploration vehicles had also lifted skyward.” Two Washington, D.C., department stores were offering Japanese telescopes ranging from $19.99 to $1,000.00. One toy store manager said sales of space-related toys had jumped 70% or 80% in two months. Rockets propelled by solid-fuel inserts sold for $1.50 to $5.00 complete with recovery parachute. One Washington store had sold out supply of $10 spacesuits. Demand for rental of color TV sets in Washington area had been “terrific,” according to area dealer. (Cushing, W Post, 7/16/69, Dll)

•	U.S. newspaper editorials hailed Apollo 11 launch.
Miami News: “All America, represented by three lonely men in space, is on its way to the moon. In fact, this is a people’s effort, arousing the interest and participation of all the people of this country. This is evidenced by the more than one million persons on hand at Cape Kennedy . . . for the start of the moon voyage and by the many millions who join in the adventure by television. Today’s magnificent launch, and the elan stirred in our people by it, makes this one of America’s most splendid hours.” (Miami News, 7/17/69, A16) Washington Evening Star: countdown which culminated in Apollo 11 liftoff, “regardless of NASA’s official records,” had begun, “when primitive man first looked up into the night sky to gaze at the moon, and to feel the first stirring of wonder.” (W Star, 7/16/69, A22) Huntsville Times: Manhattan Project had climaxed with July 16, 1945, explosion of world’s first successful atomic bomb. “Men, it seems, can only pray that the consequences of the quest of the planets may be better than those born in the irreversible explosion on a New Mexico desert 24 years ago.” (Huntsville Times, 7/16/69)
Chicago Sun-Times: “Man has always looked upward to the stars, first in fear and awe, then in need to know. Today the first great step to the firmament will be taken. If it is successful man will stand on the threshold of outer space—and standing there will reach outward.” (C Sun-Times, 7/16/69)
•	Svenska Dagbladet, Stockholm, Sweden, welcomed Apollo 11 launch:
“One of the greatest adventures of human history begins today. . . . Studies of the moon will to a great degree enrich our knowledge of both the earth and space. Among other things it will be possible to make comparisons which will propel science by leaps in various disciplines. . . . While we can predict much that may result from conquest of the moon, there will in all likelihood be many results
which we cannot even imagine now. All great discoveries and bold undertakings have brought advances which no one could have foreseen from the outset.”
Arbetet, Malmo, Sweden: “There is an irrational element in these feats of discovery which fortunately dominates the prosaic calculation of gains. Then one can regret that man’s fantasy seems incapable of being fired for such a tremendous task as eliminating starvation from our earth, or for bringing peace to Biafra or for eliminating the U.S. Negro ghettos. . . . Three men will be lifted to world acclaim today on the crest of mankind’s greatest ever coordinated effort. . . .” (Am Embassy, Stockholm)
July 17: White House announced Apollo 11 crew on way to moon was carrying Soviet commemorative medals brought back to U.S. by Astronaut Frank Borman, who had received them from widows of Cosmonauts Yuri A. Gagarin and Vladimir M. Komarov during his Moscow visit. Apollo 11 also carried Apollo 204 crew patch and commemorative medals struck for families of Astronauts Virgil I. Grissom, Edward H. White, and Roger B. Chaffee before astronauts died in Jan. 27, 1967, fire.
President Nixon said, “The names of Gagarin and Komarov, of Grissom, White, and Chaffee, share the honors we pray will come to Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins. In recognizing the dedication and sacrifice of brave men of different nations, we underscore an example we hope to set: that if men can reach the moon, men can reach agreement.” (PD, 7/21/69, 999)
•	Aerospace industry was having its greatest week in history with Apollo
11 launch, said New York Times, but aerospace stocks remained in doldrums. Wall Street was “bearish about the industry and, from an investment standpoint, unenthusiastic about space.” Security analysts interviewed agreed Apollo 11 would have little effect on long-depressed stocks, which commenced decline in 1968; many were selling near lows for year. Aerospace industry was chief beneficiary of space program funds, but largest portion of $34 billion spent since 1960 had been allocated before “really spectacular shots” occurred. While Apollo program had been “treniendous boon to the aerospace industry and to the advancement of technology,” it represented small part of total industry revenues and outlook was for further decline.

•	Apollo 11 launch continued to draw wide editorial comment in foreign
and national press.
New York Times: “One could hardly watch the magnificent spectacle of the liftoff, let alone contemplate the feats of human ingenuity that made it possible, as well as the courage and skill of the flyers, without some reflection upon the meaning of this event. . . . The temptation is strong to fall back upon lyricism. The poetry of the thing has yet to find its expression in any of the earnest, proficient Americans who have ventured away from the Earth; yet, the stunning beauty of
man’s most marvelous creation, as it rose in its majesty toward the unknown, toward the future, could be matched only by the profound sense of having been present at an end to something and therefore necessarily at a beginning.” (Wicker, NYT, 7/17/69)
Chicago Tribune: “The Apollo 11 blastoff was as beautiful a one as we’ve seen. It displayed every hit of the precision and the careful planning which we have come to expect from NASA.” One of most “satisfying” things was that, “like our earlier launchings, it took place within the sight of anybody who wanted to go to the Florida coast to watch it, and was broadcast live to countless millions more in every corner of the world. People will not fail to contrast this with the secrecy of Russia’s unmanned Luna 15, which may reach the moon today on a mysterious mission of its own.” (C Trib, 7/17/69) Christian Science Monitor: “And although it is an American moon-craft, bearing American men . . . the venture is, in the best sense, a universal one. It is the result of American technology putting to use the knowledge, techniques and discoveries in which all nations and races have participated. ... all nations and peoples are taking part.” (CSM, 1/17/69)
Seattle Times: “The space program has yielded immense new resources in . . . scientific and technological advances which . . . make the program worth while even beyond the explorations and discoveries —and national pride—offered by the ventures into outer space. It strikes us, therefore, that the time is at hand for these so-called byproducts of the space program, which hold such promise for utilization in behalf of mankind, to be put to work for that purpose.” (S Times, 7/17/69)
Bulgarian Telegraph Agency report carried in Bulgarian newspapers Rabotnichesko Delo, Narodna Mladezh, Trud, and Kooperativno Celo commented: “In the coming days all humanity will follow this flight with interest and tension.

•	Apollo passive seismic experiment, part of extravehicular activity to be
performed by Apollo 11 astronauts on moon, was described in Science as “the most exciting experiment in seismology.” Dr. G. Latham and Dr. M. Ewing of Columbia Univ.’s Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Dr. F. Press of mit, and Dr. G. Sutton of Univ. of Hawaii explained objective was to detect naturally occurring seismic events on lunar surface through early Apollo scientific experiment package (easep) planted on moon. Package weighed 105 lbs and would transmit data to earth one year (or maximum two years), during lunar days because its solar cell panels required illumination to provide power. Complete Apollo lunar surface experiments package (alsep), containing at least three additional experiments for measurements of solar wind and magnetic field, would be included on Apollo 12 for day and night operation.
In Apollo 11 experiment astronaut would remove instrument from lm to smoothest area within 6.6—9.8 ft (20—30 m) of lm, unfold solar panels, adjust package level to within 5°, orient it with azimuth for maximum illumination of solar panels, and aim antenna toward earth. MSC would issue commands to uncage and level seismometers and select proper gain. Expected sources of lunar seismic activity included several hundred monthly moonquakes, thermal stresses produced by rapid temperature variations at surface; tidal stresses exerted by earth and sun; and meteoroid impacts. By end of Apollo program, scientists hoped to have achieved crude curves of travel time for body and surface waves and beginning of seismicity map of moon.
During post-Apollo period, seismologists wanted to achieve wider distribution of detectors to map seismically active belts in greater detail; study mechanisms of energy release; lower minimum detectable ground motion of individual seismometer; and improve performance of long-period seismometer systems at ultralong-period end of spectrum for recording surface waves from moonquakes, free oscillations of moon, and lunar tides.

Lucian called it The True History but confessed in the preface that he wrote ‘of things which are not and never could have been.’ It was a political satirist’s precautionary disclaimer because his real subject was the stupidity of human warfare. His lunar voyagers got caught up in internecine strife between the moonmen and the sunmen over the colonization of Venus! If there is something instructive in the thought, it may be the implication that after two millennia of philosophy men are still fighting over real estate and still dying in the name of philosophical abstractions, but that a voyage to the moon is just as feasible (though somewhat more expensive) as a trip to Timbuktu.” (Wiegers, W Post, 1/21/69, Bl; CR, 7/22/69, H6189—90)

• Press in U.S. and around the world underscored Apollo IPs landing on moon and man’s first steps on another planet.
St. Louis Post-Dispatch: “There is no doubt that the United States should continue to support a substantial spacefaring program. Anything else would be a denial of the scientific spirit of the century and the qualities that have made America what it is. But its scope should be measured by findings and probabilities—and one other factor. Future spacefaring ought to be a co-operative effort of all nations able to participate, with the benefits to be shared by all.” (St. Louis P—D, 7/20/69)
Washington Sunday Star: “A creature that can stand where Armstrong and Aldrin stand tonight—that can, in the future, move among the spheres and literally explore new worlds ... is unlikely to give up on the hard task of perfecting himself and his life in his natural environment on earth. The God who brought him thus far from a blob of squirming protoplasm ... is unlikely ... to let man blow it all now. Here . . . must be the answer to the national debate as to whether we go ahead in space, or whether we tend to our knitting at home. We are bound to do both. . . . The progressive expansion of the physical and spiritual domain of man inevitably will intensify our determination and ability, in concert with other nations, to build a home world where hunger, fear and violence no longer have a place.” (W Star, 7/20/69, Gl)
William Hines in Washington Sunday Star: “One cannot question the majesty of conception or magnitude of effort that made Apollo 11 possible.” But one could ask, “Is this trip really necessary?” One saw in Apollo “that fundamental failing called hubris, which got so many protagonists into hot water in the old Greek mythology. Hubris in English is usually taken to mean prideful arrogance; in ancient Greek the word meant simple insolence. The Apollo enthusiast rejects the concept of hubris; he says we go to the moon not because we are arrogant, but because we are driven, and thereby implicitly rejects the concept of free will and substitutes sappiness for sassiness. The majority asks, ‘But if we didn’t go, what?’ and the minority responds, ‘If we didn’t go, so what?’” (W Star, 7/20/69, G2)
Humorist Art Buchwald in Washington Post: “Sometimes one gets the feeling that the right hand germs in the Government don’t know what the left hand germs are doing. This was brought home to me . . . when I read about the millions of dollars that were being spent to see that the astronauts did not bring back a single germ from the moon. Unfortunately, across the page from that story was another that the Army was going ahead with open air testing of nerve gases and germ warfare.” (W Post, 7/20/69, B6)

July 21: U.S.S.R.’s Luna XV (launched July 13) had landed on moon at 6:45 pm Moscow time (11:45 am EDT) and had ended its work, Tass announced. Spacecraft had “reached the moon’s surface in the preset area” after 52 revolutions around moon and 86 communications sessions during which “the work of the new systems of the station was checked, the parameters of the trajectory of the movement was measured, and scientific research was conducted.” Tass said Luna XV had demonstrated capability to land on various areas of lunar surface by
changing selenocentric orbit and that mission had yielded important data on spacecraft systems.
Sir Bernard Lovell, Jodrell Bank Experimental Station Director, said signals from spacecraft had ended suddenly and estimated craft might have landed in Sea of Crises, about 500 mi from Sea of Tranquility. “If we don’t get any more signals, we will assume it crash-landed.

•	Washington Post said it found intellectuals “deeply divided” on implica-
tions of lunar landing. Univ. of California physicist Dr. Owen Chamberlain had said achievement showed “mankind can be in charge of his destiny. . . . We should now come back and put our emphasis on the surface of the globe” to achieve peace, lessen poverty, control overpopulation, and preserve our environment.
Univ. of California chemist Dr. Harold C. Urey said if some of space effort reliability rubbed off on industry, “spin-off” would be enormous and space program would pay for itself. Less than % of 1% of GNP was spent on space and if lessened there was no guarantee it would be spent on necessary domestic programs.
Harvard Univ. biochemist Dr. George Wald had said: “What should have been a great flight of the human spirit comes to us heavy with threat. Those almost miraculous guidance systems that so uncannily find their targets, will they one day be guiding missiles to find us?” Dr. Wald wondered if Apollo 11 had opened new horizons for his students. “I am afraid that they see in this an exercise in great wealth
and power, heavy with military and political overtones. I am afraid that they feel a little more trapped; a little more disillusioned, a little more desperate.”
Most overseas intellectuals tended to concur with historian Prof. Arnold J. Toynbee’s judgment, “If we are going to go on behaving on earth as we have behaved here so far, then a landing on the moon will have to be written off as just one more shocking misuse of mankind’s slender surplus product.”
But Oxford Univ.’s Prof. A. J. Ayer had said, “I doubt if Prof. Toynbee has any evidence that men are being prevented in any large numbers from turning their minds to meaningful pursuits by the part which they play, or the interest which they take, in the exploration of space. ... I think that these spatial explorations . , . are intellectually stimulating, especially to young people.” (W Post, 7/22/69, Ai4)

•	National and international press continued comment on Apollo 11 lunar
landing.
Philadelphia Inquirer; “Will this magnificent accomplishment serve as inspiration, urging Americans and all mankind on to a genuine ‘giant leap’ forward, not merely into the infinite reaches of space but into the infinite possibilities of achievement on earth where the space age has recorded many more failures than successes? Or will the inspiration be abandoned before the veiled censure of those who seem to suggest the solution of all human dilemmas lies in turning away from space to other priorities?” Cutbacks at hour of triumph would be only waste of investment in technology which could be helped in solving earth problems. “This is no time to falter, our astronauts should
come home to a world and nation determined to fulfill the prophecy in Commander Armstrong’s words.” (P Inq, 7/22/69)
W.ashington Post: It was foolish “to leap from this historic moment to eager expectations of the day when men will live and work in space, when colonies will be established, food raised and industrial products built on heavenly bodies other than the earth. These things will doubtless come in their own good time. But this is not the occasion on which to make a new national commitment in space that would keep NASA’s program going at the frantic pace which fulfilled President Kennedy’s great promise for the moon. Now is the occasion, rather, to establish a steady program of space development, one removed from the political debate <Jver national priorities, which will ensure that we establish a firm base for future generations to build upon while creating at home ... a kind of society which will allow them to use fully the new opportunities opened up by the three new American heroes and the tens of thousands of other people who made their flight possible.” (W Post, 7/22/69, A24)
Handels Och Sjofartstidning, Goteborg, Sweden: “This is a small step for a man, but a great one for humanity. Neil Armstrong’s commentary when he stepped down onto the surface of the moon has every prospect of becoming one of those winged expressions which generations of school children will commit to memory. ... Now should be the time to replace the extraordinarily costly space race with cooperation between the Soviet and the U.S.A.” (Am Embassy, Stockholm)

•	At msc news conference following Apollo 11 splashdown, Dr. George E.
Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said: . . we now stand at what is undoubtedly the greatest decision point in the history of this planet.” Apollo 11 had proved “that man is no longer bound to the limits of the planet on which for so long he has lived. We will return to the moon first in November and then at regular intervals in the coming year. But these trips are only the first step. . . . Will we press forward to explore other planets or will we deny the opportunity to the future? To me, the choice is clear. We
must take the next step. . . . This is the time for decision. . . . The knowledge possessed by men is sufficient, the resources are adequate for the task of carrying out this next step. . . .
“In this moment of man’s greatest achievement, it is timely for us to dedicate ourselves to the unfinished work so nobly begotten by three of us. To resolve that this nation, under God, will join with all men in the pursuit of the destiny of mankind will lead to the way to the planets.”
In answer to questions, Dr. Mueller said next major step should be manned landing on Mars which would be possible “sometime after 1980.”
l/g Samuel C. Phillips (usaf), Apollo Program Director, told press Apollo team was “strongest team that’s ever assembled in the history of man. It has the strength of technical and engineering confidence, scientific competence, and management competence that’s unexcelled. It has the dedication that’s necessary to be able to tackle an almost impossible job and bring it through” and an exciting future in lunar exploration.
Second manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 12, would be launched from ksc Nov. 14 toward touchdown on Site 7 in moon’s Ocean of Storms. Primary objective would be to deploy Apollo lunar surface experiment package (alsep), explore and survey mare area, and return samples to earth. Secondary objective, if lm softlanded on target, would be to examine Surveyor III spacecraft (launched April 17, 1967), which was resting on moon near planned Apollo 12 touchdown point. Astronauts would have two periods for extravehicular activities (eva), during which they would explore surface and conduct experiments for over three hours and walk farther away from spacecraft than had Apollo 11 crew. Maximum lunar stay time would be 28—32 hrs. Schedule called for planning to fly follow-on missions through Apollo 15 at four-month intervals and missions after that at five-month intervals.

And someday, because of the beginning that we have made here, the planets and the stars may belong to mankind. This reach toward the heavens, toward the stars, can eventually loose the human race from the confines of this earth and maybe even this solar system and give it immortality in the immense and never-ending reaches of space.” For
first time, “life has left its planetary cradle and the ultimate destiny of mankind is no longer confined. When the Mayflower landed on American shores the pilgrims did not envision the nation that would eventually evolve. Neither can we truly say what will eventually spring from the footprints around Tranquility Base.” (Text)

It would be “center for the cooperative planning of space exploration in which all U.N. members would be invited to take part.” U.S. and U.S.S.R. could divide responsibilities for instrumented landings on different planets. There should be “United Nations Space Station” in outer space manned by astronauts from all U.N. nations and trained at U.N. Space Institute. It would gather information about solar system and universe and be used for practical earth applications. {NYT, 7/26/69, 24)

While the United States rings July 21st red on its calendar, Europe faces the probability that when the planets are opened up we Europeans will have no part in doing it. The idea, at this late stage, of a European manned space programme is nonsense. The policy that would make more sense would be to approach the United States to see if the Administration will accept some foreign collaboration in the hugely expensive next years of its space programme. If the next American objective is Mars, a sensible Administration may welcome help and participation—especially if this excludes pressure to co-operate with the Russians. . . . There will be no opportunity in this generation that it would cost us more to miss.” {CSM, 8/1/69)

•	Psychological, technical, and political factors had combined to enable
U.S. to win lunar landing race over U.S.S.R., said Harry Schwartz in New York Times. Moscow had shown overconfidence in underrating American capabilities, ignored lunar rendezvous technique adopted by U.S., and purged Nikita S. Khrushchev, who had been “enamored of space exploits and the propaganda they gave him.” New Soviet leaders had changed priorities to concentrate on domestic problems. Since U.S. lunar landing, however, “two very different reactions are visible in the Soviet Union.” Scientists, engineers, and many ordinary people were overcome with admiration. Ideologists and Soviet propaganda managers were deeply unhappy, “and their regret that it was not Soviet cosmonauts who went to the moon is scarcely hidden.” (AIT, 7/27/69)
•	Washington Sunday Star editorial said: “Apollo 11 has cast a harsh light
on life on earth, showing man’s failures in sharp contrast to his breathtaking technical achievements. It is a vision that should ... be exploited as an incentive to get the vitally needed jobs done on earth.” But, the U.S. could not withdraw from space. “The complete Apollo program . . . should be funded. Beyond that, serious consideration
should be given to the establishment of permanent manned stations on the moon so that we may truly explore and perhaps exploit the new world that we have already conquered. The manned orbiting station that NASA has proposed should be provided to test the ability of men to live and work for long periods in weightlessness. And far more emphasis should be placed . . . on unmanned probes of the planets.” Minimum requirement should be enough momentum in program to prevent it from falling apart through disuse. Every effort should be made “to enlist the cooperation, the technical help, and the financial support of any nation that is willing to contribute to the adventure that must, finally, be seen as the collective achievement of all mankind.” (W Star, 7/27/69, El)
•	In Washington Sunday Star William Hines said: “Considering how very
little he had to do with the whole enterprise, it is remarkable how much political mileage President Nixon got out of the flight of Apollo 11. The plaque, the phone call and the trip to greet the returning heroes all were benefits Nixon inherited rather than earned.” Official NASA space age history This New Ocean, published by GPO in 1966, mentioned Nixon only once in 648 pages “and there hardly as an aggressive champion of manned space flight.” Book said Nixon, as Vice President and as presidential candidate running against John F. Kennedy, had defended Eisenhower Administration’s attitude toward space which ruled out manned flights to moon in foreseeable future. “The new President’s belated enthusiasm blurs memories of the olden days,” Hines said. “But ‘This New Ocean’ remains, proving perhaps that all government-sponsored history books should be armed to self-destruct whenever a change of administration occurs.” (W Star, 1/21/69, E4)

Readings were obtained at NASA’s Goldstone Tracking Station in California by team directed by Dr. Richard M. Goldstein during planet’s closest approach to earth (Mars had been within 45 million mi of earth June 9). They would be of great interest to astronomers because they showed that areas which appeared light to telescopes might be either high or low in elevation.

July 30—31: NASA’s Mariner VI, launched Feb. 24 on Mars equatorial flyby mission, approached Mars and completed 17 pictures of planet taken at about 111,400-mi altitude, which showed ragged edges of polar cap, W-shaped cloud, and seas, deserts, and craters seen by Mariner IV in 1965.
As spacecraft neared and swung around Mars it took 24 close-up pictures from about 2,000 mi at closest point. Pictures were so sharply defined and detailed that they were shown live on TV instead of being refined and released later in photographic prints as originally planned. Pictures—enhanced by computers at JPL to clear out static, highlight images, adjust contrast and brightness, and exaggerate features—were spectacular. They showed that Mars was heavily cratered and looked very much like moon. One photo showed 11-mi-dia crater closely resembling moon’s Copernicus crater and diagonal ditch resembling lunar rifle. During closest approach, onboard TV cameras took 12
high-resolution and 12 medium-resolution pictures, stored some on board for later playback, and transmitted some immediately to ground stations for conversion to images at JPL. Three of four onboard experiments—TV to take pictures, uv spectrometer to identify and measure gases in upper atmosphere, and infrared radiometer to measure planet’s temperature—functioned satisfactorily. Only anomaly was failure in cooling of one channel on infrared spectrometer, designed to identify gases in lower Martian atmosphere, which prevented proper acquisition of data.
JPL controllers temporarily lost contact with second Mariner, Mariner VII, en route to Mars, at 6:00 pm EDT July 30. Engineers speculated that spacecraft had been thrown out of alignment when struck by micrometeoroid traveling at 40 mps and had locked on planet Jupiter or another bright object. Contact with Mariner VII was regained seven hours later by switching from one antenna to another and proper attitude was restored by rolling spacecraft around until it locked on star Canopus. Although some of data being transmitted appeared to be abnormal, flyby mission was still expected to succeed.
Mariner VI would continue taking pictures and play back recorded near-encounter data during final phase of mission. Data would be compared with data from Mariner VII (launched March 27), which would fly past Mars polar region Aug. 4.

•	nsf published Research and Development in Industry, 1967: Funds,
1967; Scientists and Engineers, January 1968 (nsf 69—28) : Historically, about 70% of U.S. R&D had been performed by industrial sector. In 1967, industry spent $16.4 billion for R&D, four and half times 1953 level of $3.6 billion. Federal agencies financed 51% of 1967 total, or $8.4 billion. Ratio was down from 1959 high of 59%. NASA and dod furnished 89% of Federal funds to industry in 1967 and supported 89% of 158,000 R&D scientists and engineers working on Federal programs in January 1968. NASA’s R&D cost was $55,400 per scientist or engineer, while DOD spent $51,600. Industry spent $8 billion of its own funds for R&D in 1967, 11% more than in 1966 and 265% more than in 1953.
In January 1968, 387,900 full-time-equivalent R&D scientists and engineers were in industry sector, of which 59% worked on company-financed R&D projects. Industrial spending for basic research reached $655 million in 1967, 5% higher than previous year and more than four times 1953 level. (Text)
•	MOL cancellation “should at most be a ‘postponement,’ ” Dr. Edward C.
Welsh, former nasc Executive Secretary, said in Air Force/Space Digest. “Contrary to assertions made by people who should know better, the mol was not planned as a weapon system and would not have been a threat to any other nation.” mol observations would be “as peaceful as those, obtained on the NASA Gemini and Apollo flight. Men on board the spacecraft can be justified by the contributions men make in matters of choice of observations, maintenance, and communication
with earth.” mol would not duplicate NASA’s Apollo Applications program. “To try to combine the Air Force and NASA manned programs would waste much of the investments already made, would delay both programs, would increase the total cost over the long run, and would violate the sound administrative principle of having the experts do what they have been trained to do. Failure to get a maximum return from this national-security system would seem to be woefully shortsighted and wasteful.” (AF/SD, 7/69, 60-1)

•	Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, outlined possible 1981—1982
manned mission to Mars in speech before Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco. With “window opening” on Nov. 12, 1981, expedition “would set forth from earth orbit [where spacecraft were assembled] in two six-man vehicles, each propelled by three nuclear rockets.” At end of Mars injection burn by two outer rockets, rockets would be disengaged and return to earth orbit for later reuse. Third rocket would remain unfired as spacecraft coasted to Mars. On nine-month journey spacecraft could be joined and spun to provide artificial gravity.
“On August 9, 1982, the craft would arrive at Mars, and the unused rocket fired to brake each ship into Mars orbit. About three months would be spent orbiting Mars while two surface landers . . . took astronauts down to surface for a month-long stay. These landers would also be three-man laboratories in which men could live and work productively on the surface of Mars. At the end of their surface research the astronauts would rendezvous again with the spacecraft overhead, and then begin the return voyage by firing the nuclear engine again on October 28, 1982.” Spacecraft would swing by Venus Feb. 28, 1983, using Venus’ orbital motion around sun to retard it and sling it toward earth. “Returning to earth on August 14, 1983, the nuclear rocket would fire for the third time to put each space ship into earth orbit. The crews would return to earth via the shuttle. After refurbishing, the space ships would be available for the next voyage.”
To hold option open for Mars voyages in 1980s, U.S. should in 1970s develop reusable shuttle for flight between earth and low earth orbit, permanent orbiting space station, and nuclear rocket propulsion. (Text)

August 2: Press conference on Mariner VI preliminary results was held at JPL. Scientists reported experiments had revealed that recurring white blob seen in previous Mars pictures was 300-mi wide crater with peak in center; linear features known as canals were actually large, irregular, low-contrast splotches without specific detail; temperature in equatorial area ranged from 75°F to —100°F; atmosphere was almost nonexistent; Mars had no sharply defined borders separating light and dark areas; and Martian surface was more heavily cratered than previously believed.
Dr. Charles A. Barth of Univ. of Colorado said any life on Mars would be very different from life on earth, perhaps form that used carbon dioxide. He said uv spectrometer had found atomic carbon and carbon monoxide, but no traces of nitrogen—essential to life on earth.

August 3—4: Photos of Mars taken from 65,000-mi altitude by NASA’s Mariner VII were received by JPL and shown live on TV. Although pictures were clear, canals were barely visible as dark splotchy areas, indicating they were not sharply defined features as previously believed. Viewers saw 100-mi-wide, 750-mi-long dark streak identified as Agathadaemon canal, Cerberus canal in light Plateau Elysium area, and Martian south pole with craters filled with substance resembling snow or ice. Pictures showed white grid pattern around Nix Olympica, identified by Mariner VI photos as 300-mi-wide crater. Absence in Mariner VII photos of bright streak on Tempe desert near Mars north pole that had been visible in Mariner VI photos suggested meteorological phenomenon similar to earth’s seasonal changes.

Weekly Bulletin said, (NASA Hq WB, 8/4/69, 1) August 4—5: NASA’s Mariner VII transmitted first closeup photos of Mars south pole as it flew within 2,100 mi of planet. Dr. Robert P, Sharp, geologist at Cal Tech, said 31 photos might look like “baby pictures of Earth. This is what the Earth might have looked like some four billion years ago before it developed an atmosphere and oceans to weather its surface and nurture life.” Photos taken on pass Aug. 4 were transmitted to JPL Aug. 5.
Polar cap, which had appeared gleaming white in more distant photos, looked dull gray in closeups. Pictures showed south polar cap with snow-like substance-—possibly frozen carbon dioxide—piled up in vast dunes; pocked with deep, steeply walled craters; and much darker than desert to north. Floor of bright circular Hellas desert area, believed to be shallow crater or collapsed area, was strangely free of meteorite impact craters.

August 5: Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, and other top NASA officials testified on future space programs before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences.
Introducing programs, Dr. Paine said: “The decade of the 1970’s and 1980’s should have a program as bold in concept and as productive as we have had in the decade of the 1960’s. ... we need to have clear objectives to focus our work and a commitment, subject ... to annual review, as to what these achievements will be. Our general goal area should be the continued exploration of the solar system while deriving the maximum scientific and practical benefits here on earth from the space program. There is no question that, at some future time, we will have the capability for manned planetary exploration and we need to face now some of the decisions that will not bear fruition for more than a decade. Although I do not believe that we will see manned exploration of the planets in the 1970’s in the United States ... I do think this could come in the 1980’s. It is by no means clear that for the Soviet Union the decision may not be made to mount a crash program and bring this in before the end of the decade of the 1970’s.”
Dr. Wernher von Braun, msfc Director, described possible 1981— 1982, 12-man, 2-ship expedition to Mars [see Aug. 1]. Each spacecraft would weigh 1.6 million lbs at departure from earth orbit and would be 270 ft long, “smaller than what we are flying already to the moon.”
nasa was using “concept of reusability” in planning, to improve and reduce cost of operating in space, Dr. George E. Mueller, nasa Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, told Committee. Reusability could be achieved “through the reuse of launch and space vehicles and . . . through the reuse of a mission module such as a space station” put into orbit and used over 10-yr or even 20-yr period. Space shuttles would be designed to run 100 or more flights. Modules and vehicles would be designed for multiple applications in earth, lunar, and synchronous orbits. Space tug would permit travel from space station to other spacecraft and back again—“general purpose . . . equipment.” In earth orbital operations, “it permits us to fly off from the space station over to ... an oao, orbiting astronomical observatory, either to repair or check the oao, or to bring it back to a space station where it can then be loaded on the space shuttle for return to earth and then brought back into orbit after repairs.” (Transcript)

•	Dissatisfaction with substandard performance in other parts of society
was “something worthwhile that the Space Program is contributing to the United States,” NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, said in speech before National Press Club in Washington, D.C. “I hope we have spurred our society and our people to . . . demand higher performance, to set bolder goals, and then to have the gumption to stand up before the whole world and demonstrate whether or not the goals are achieved.” Space program had also taught “need for broadly enlisting not only American capability, but the best people from around the world willing to throw their competence and a portion of their careers into challenging endeavors.” It had “unleashed in the 1960’s the talents and energies of a technological generation.” U.S. must continue “to put together bold programs that will release the creative energies of our people in productive channels.”
Dr. Paine thought history would record as “the great contribution of our generation” astronauts’ blazing of “trail for all future generations of men who want to . . . conquer new worlds. . . . Through man’s brains, energy and resources life can—and life will—extend itself through the solar system. . . . The 1980’s are very clearly the decade in which both we and the Soviet Union, with reasonable-sized space programs in the 1970’s, will develop a technological capability for landing on Mars.”
In response to questions, Dr. Paine said: “It seems clear to me that there are increasing opportunities for all nations to work together in space exploration and application. Certainly we and the Russians can and should cooperate more closely in space science so our two programs can produce greater results than the simple sum of their outputs.” (Transcript)
•	Future space program was described by Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA
Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, before National Space Club in Washington, D.C. Reusable nuclear vehicle to serve as space shuttle between space station in earth orbit and space station in lunar orbit would be “fined link that would permit us to reduce the cost of operation to something like $200 for moving a pound of material from the earth’s surface to the lunar surface and return as compared to something like $100 thousand a pound using today’s tech-
niques. Similar reductions in the cost of transportation to the earth orbital station will permit us for the first time to consider processing materials in space, to use space for the kind of laboratory work that ^ we now associate with ground-based laboratories.” By end of 1970s “we would find so many uses for operations in synchronous orbit both for observing the universe and for observing the earth that we would have established a space station in synchronous orbit which would be regularly supplied by a nuclear shuttle system and which would provide us with direct television broadcasting and direct radio broadcasting to the homes of all people in the world, as well as providing us with great stellar observatories and a viewing platform for air traffic control, navigation and for a permanent weather watch.
“. . . this approach to using space is one that is readily extended, once the shuttle capability has been developed, to a corresponding approach for planetary exploration and . . . the same nuclear shuttle system together with the space station modules need only to be supplemented by a Mars landing module to permit us to carry out the first manned planetary expedition to Mars.” (Text)
August 7: Scientists at JPL presented conflicting opinions to newsmen on preliminary data from Mariner VI and Mariner VII flybys of Mars.
Dr. George C. Pimentel and Dr. Kenneth C. Herr of Univ. of California at Berkeley said data from infrared spectrometer indicated presence of gaseous ammonia and methane in Martian atmosphere. “We are confident that we have detected solid carbon dioxide that is not on the surface; that is, it is suspended as a cloud above the polar cap. Our data are consistent with and suggest that the polar cap is composed of water ice and probably not solid carbon dioxide near the polar cap edge.” If life did exist on Mars, they said, it could be in region near edge of polar icecap where “polar ice provides a reservoir of water” and solid carbon dioxide cloud “provides protection from ultraviolet radiation.”
Dr. Gerry Neugebauer of Cal Tech said temperature of Mars was “strong circumstantial evidence that the polar caps are in fact predominantly made of carbon dioxide.” Infrared radiometer experiment, which measured temperatures on Martian surface, indicated that temperature of south polar cap was close to —253 °F, temperature at which carbon dioxide would solidify in thin Martian atmosphere.
uv spectrometer experiment had found large amount of uv radiation reflected from south polar icecap, indicating that uv light from sun was penetrating thin Martian atmosphere and reaching surface. Dr. Charles W. Hord of Univ. of Colorado said strong uv radiation reaching surface “would destroy many of the important molecular bonds of organic compounds.” If life did exist on Mars, he said, it “must be pretty strong stuff,” or it must have some means of protection against uv rays.
Dr. Robert B. Leighton of Cal Tech said one of most striking results of Mariner photos was indication of dynamic process occurring on Martian surface. Unlike rest of Martian surface, which was heavily cratered and closely resembled moon, Hellas area appeared to be smooth and free of craters. “Hellas is the first non-lunar-like feature” discovered by Mariner VII, he said. Apparently there was “activity in
that region . . . obliterating craters as fast as they are being formed.” (Bishop, WSJ, 8/8/69; Sullivan, NYT, 8/8/69, 1; Lannan, W Star, 8/8/69, A4)

The choice of missions—for future flights to the moon and for future operations that will lead some day to a trip to Mars and eventually other planets— should be largely in their hands. They, far better than the men who

August 9—15: NASA’s Oso VI (oso-g) Orbiting Solar Observatory was successfully launched from etr at 3:52 am edt by two-stage Thor-Delta N booster to study sun and its influence on earth’s atmosphere. Orbital parameters: apogee, 348.0 mi (560 km); perigee, 307.6 mi (495 km); period, 95.2 min; and inclination, 32.96°. Primary mission objective was to obtain high-resolution spectral data from pointed experiments in 10- to 20-kev range and 1 to 1,300 A range during one solar rotation and make raster scans of solar disc in selected wavelengths. Spacecraft would obtain data from nonpointed and pointed experiments for more than one solar rotation for extended observations of single lines and solar flares.
Pac (Package Attitude Control) system, carried pickaback on Delta 2nd stage, was ejected into orbit with 340-mi (547.1-km) apogee, 300mi (482.7-km) perigee, 94.2-min period, and 32.9° inclination. Primary objective was to flight-test long-life, low-power, three-axis Pac earth-stabilized control system for Delta 2nd stage and to demonstrate feasibility of using stage as experimental platform.
Oso VI was spin-stabilized, weighed 640 lbs, carried seven experiments, was designed with six-month lifetime, and had two main sections—wheel (lower), which carried nondirectional scanning experiments and basic support equipment, and sail (upper), which carried pointed experiments. It was similar to previous osos but had unique capability which enabled two sun-pointing telescopes to study in detail uv and x-ray spectra at any point on solar disc and would provide greater knowledge of solar atmosphere (chromosphere) as well as outermost layer (corona) visible only through special instruments or during total solar eclipse. Experiments, designed to continue and extend work of preceding oso spacecraft, were provided by Harvard College Observatory, Naval Research Laboratory, Rutgers Univ., Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories, Univ. of New Mexico, Univ. of Bologna, and University College (London).
Both tape recorders were operating at liftoff and were still operating satisfactorily. Spacecraft stabilized and acquired sun as scheduled shortly after entering orbit. By Aug. 15 all experiments had been turned on and were operating satisfactorily. Two minor anomalies— higher than planned use of current by motor that provided fine elevation pointing and lower than expected spacecraft operating temperature —were not expected to affect spacecraft operation adversely.
Oso VI was seventh in series of eight oso spacecraft designed to provide direct observation of sun during most of 11-yr solar cycle. Oso I (launched March 7, 1962) and Oso II (launched Feb. 3, 1965) had surpassed their six-month design lifetimes and together provided more than 8,600 hrs of scientific information, oso—c (launched Aug. 25, 1965) had failed to reach orbit when booster malfunctioned. Oso III (launched March 8, 1967) and Oso IV (launched Oct. 18, 1967) continued operating satisfactorily, each providing 7% hrs of real-time data daily. Oso V (launched Jan. 22, 1969) had both tape recorders and seven of eight experiments operating satisfactorily after six months in orbit, oso program was managed by gsfc under ossa

August 9: “Scientists who have long felt that their role was secondary to that of engineers in the Apollo project” were complaining openly and trying to force greater emphasis on science in planning future lunar landing missions, John Noble Wilford reported in New York Times. “Their argument is that, with the success of Apollo 11, the project’s goal should be to learn as much as possible about the moon and not merely to repeat the demonstration that moon landings are possible.”
Dr. Elbert A. King, curator of Lunar Receiving Laboratory, had said in interview that NASA administration did not have “enough sympathy with, or understanding of, scientific objectives.” Casting science in “piggyback role” for first manned lunar landing was understandable, he said. “No one really criticizes that, because . . . getting men to the moon and back had to be a massive engineering effort. But now that we have accomplished that goal, the justification for future lunar exploration is largely science. There has to be a shift of emphasis.” Scientists were pressing for more active role in mission planning, return of larger amounts of lunar samples, selection of scientists for flight crews, and more time between missions in which to evaluate data for applications to future experiments.

° William Hines in Washington Sunday Star said time was “ripe” for NASA reorganization, “not merely the firing, promoting and transferring of officials, but the functional restructuring of the agency as well.” There was some suspicion that no place existed for Dr. Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator, who was “not only a Johnson-administration holdover, but a card-carrying Democrat as well.” Some observers believed Apollo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman, “the President’s current darling and space confidant,” might be next NASA Administrator. “The idea of putting astronauts in charge of the space program may seem incongruous, but it is clearly not beyond the realm of possibility in the image-conscious Nixon regime.”
Paine’s fate would determine that of Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller. With lunar landing, Apollo had changed from developmental to operational effort. Christopher C. Kraft, Director of Flight Operations at msc, would likely transfer to Washington as Apollo Program Manager—possibly “controlling all space missions for NASA.” Hines saw possibility of Apollo Program Director, George H.

August 11: Lunar scientist Dr. Harold C. Urey discussed moon findings at San Diego, Calif., press conference after return from study of Apollo 11 lunar samples at lrl. There was “no evidence whatever” of life on moon and, “at present, no age of the rocks on the surface of the moon is known.” Fine dust on lunar surface consisted of 50% glass—10% in form of small beads, 40% as broken-up beads—and “something else” containing minerals similar to those in lunar rocks. Dust and rocks evidenced shock as though produced by “rather large collisions somewhere that dug up material considerably deeper in the moon than the few centimeters they have been investigating.” There was no evidence of water. Chemical analyses had shown high concentration of titanium in lunar samples characteristic of area where Surveyor V and Apollo 11 had landed. “No such . . . titanium concentration occurs anywhere that we know of on the surface of Earth.”
No one had “anticipated what we are finding. And I believe that no one has a good explanation of how it got that way.” It would take “much more” than nine more Apollo manned landings to solve lunar mysteries.

August 12—18: nasa’s 951-lb Ats V (ATS—e) Applications Technology Satellite was launched from etr at 7:01 am edt by Atlas (SLV—3C)-Centaur booster on mission to conduct carefully instrumented gravity-gradient-orientation experiment for basic design information on stabilization and control of long-lived spacecraft in synchronous orbit and to obtain useful data from onboard experiments during first 30 days in orbit. Spacecraft successfully entered elliptical transfer orbit with 26,737.2-mi (43,020.2-km) apogee, 5,297.0-mi (8,522,9-km) perigee, 686,5-min period, and 17.9° inclination.
Because of anomaly which required excessive fuel to maintain stable spin condition, apogee-kick motor was fired on first apogee instead of second and spacecraft had to be biased so it would drift from position over India to intended station over area west of Ecuador. Maneuver successfully placed Ats V into near-synchronous orbit with 22,927-mi (36,889.5-km) apogee, 22,221-mi (35,753.6-km) perigee, 1,464.0-min period, 2.7° inclination, and 6.9° per day westward drift. Active nutation control was overpowered by unidentified force that caused spacecraft to go into flat spin, preventing ejection of motor case without possibility of damage to spacecraft. Controllers were investigating alternatives—stopping spacecraft spin, restoring spacecraft to normal spin mode, or minimizing ejection hazard—which could be executed Aug. 25 when spacecraft became visible to Rosman, N.C., ground station. Spacecraft was not in danger thermally or electronically and was expected to become stable and operational after successful ejection of kick motor.
Ats V was fifth in series of seven ATS satellites designed to investigate and flight-test technological developments common to number of satellite applications and useful to satellites operating in stationary orbits, conduct carefully instrumented gravity-gradient experiments for basic design information, and flight-test experiments peculiar to orbits of various missions. Ats I (launched Dec. 6, 1966) had exceeded test objectives and was still operating satisfactorily. Ats II (launched April 5, 1967), though judged a failure because of eccentric orbit, had transmitted some useful data before being turned off Oct. 23, 1967.

August 12: Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., and Michael Collins held first postflight press conference at MSC, narrating 45-min film of mission and answering questions. On meaning of lunar landing, Collins said it was “technical triumph for this country to have said what it was going to do a number of years ago, and then by golly do it. Just like we said we were going to do. Not just . . . purely technical, but also a triumph of the nation’s overall determination, will, economy, attention to detail, and a thousand and one other factors that went into it.”
To Aldrin mission meant “that many other problems perhaps can be solved in the same way by taking a commitment to solve them in long
time fashion. I think that we were timely in accepting this mission of going to the moon. It might be timely at this point to think in many other areas of other missions that could be accomplished.”
Armstrong said moon landing heralded “beginning of a new age.” He said moon was “stark and strangely different place, but it looked friendly . . . and proved to be friendly.” Astronauts had much less trouble than expected on lunar surface. Primary difficulty was that “there was just far too little time to do the variety of things that we would have liked to have done. . . . We had the problem of the 5 year old boy in a candy store. There are just too many interesting things to do.”
Armstrong said that during landing they “were concerned about running low on fuel on range extension we did to avoid the boulder field and craters. We used a significant percentage of our fuel margins and we were quite close to our legal limit.” On possibility of abort during period they were receiving alarm signals, Aldrin said procedure in preparation simulations had been always to “keep going as long as we could. . . . The computer was continuing to issue guidance . . . and it was continuing to fly the vehicle down in the same way that it was programmed to do. The only thing that was missing ... is that we did not have some of the displays . . . and we had to make several entries ... to clear up that area.” Armstrong added, “We would have continued the landing so long as the trajectory seemed safe. And landing is possible under these conditions, although with considerably less confidence than you have when you have the information from the ground and the computer in its normal manner available to you.” (Transcript)

White, and Roger B. Chaffee the NASA Distinguished Service Medals for professional skill, courage, and dedication to duty in Project Apollo. They gave their lives in their country’s historic undertaking to realize the goal of landing men on the moon and returning them safely to earth.”
President also asked Dr. Paine to read citation of NASA Group Achievement Award to Apollo 11 Mission Operations Team “for exceptional service in planning and exemplary execution of mission operational responsibilities for . . . first manned lunar landing mission.” Award was presented to Apollo Flight Control Engineer Stephen G. Bales, who bad made decision to proceed with lunar landing when computers failed just before Eagle’s landing on Sea of Tranquility, on behalf of 400,000 persons who had contributed to Apollo program success.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, as nasc chairman, presented Medal of Freedom, nation’s highest civilian honor, to Apollo 11 astronauts for participation in “a unique and profoundly important adventure. The accumulated scientific knowledge and technological ability of mankind made man’s first step on the moon practicable; the courage and skill of men like these made it possible. Their contributions to this undertaking will be remembered so long as men wonder and dream and search for truth on this planet and among the stars.”
Replying to honors, Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., said: “What Apollo has begun we hope will spread out in many directions, not just in space, but underneath the seas and in the cities, to tell us unforgettably that we can do what we will and must and want to do.”

•	New York Times editorial on Aug. 12 Apollo 11 news conference in
Houston: “What came through most clearly in yesterday’s enthralling first-hand report by the Apollo astronauts was the infinitesimal margin by which Eagle escaped either catastrophe or a decision to abort the moon landing. Either of the two major problems that emerged in those nerve-wracking moments before touchdown—the overburdened computer and the near-exhaustion of their fuel supply before Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin found a suitable landing spot—might have forced a very different ending to the historic mission. That all turned out perfectly is a tribute to the astronauts’ skill, courage and poise as well as to the ability of the back-up personnel at Mission Control in Houston.” (NYT, 8/13/69, 40)

•	Cross-country ceremonies for Apollo 11 astronauts constituted “probably
the single greatest peacetime celebration in the nation’s history,” New York Times editorial said. “It was more than a tribute to three courageous and able men; it was also an act of homage to the hundreds of thousands of workers, engineers, technicians and scientists whose hard work over almost a decade made the moon landing possible. At the most fundamental level, perhaps, the outpouring of national rejoicing stemmed from the renewed sense of purpose the Apollo’s incredible feat had brought to a nation long torn and depressed by military travail abroad and racial and generational antagonisms at home. The essence of that sentiment was well stated by Mr. Armstrong when he declared at the United Nations that ‘we citizens of earth who can solve the problem of leaving earth can also solve the problems of staying on earth.’ ” (NYT, 8/14/69)

Sharp of Cal Tech; Alan G. Herriman and Dr. Andrew T. Young of JPL; Bradford A. Smith of New Mexico State Univ.; Merton E. Davies of rand Corp.; and Conway B. Leovy of Univ. of Washington: Surface of Mars “appears similar to that of the Moon, but there are significant differences; some features seen from Earth are characterized; the ‘blue haze’ hypothesis is disproved; and new phenomena associated with the polar cap aTe discovered.” Mars resembled moon in abundance, form, arrangement, and size of craters, but there appeared to be break in size-distribution curve of craters in some parts of Mars not characteristic of moon—apparently because Mars had more effective weathering and transportation process than moon. Similarities between Martian and lunar surfaces included craters with slump blocks, terrace, and radial dry-debris avalanche chutes on steep inner surfaces; central peaks, polygonal outlines, blocky ejecta rims, and irregular ejecta; and irregularly sinuous ridges. Differences included more subdued relief of many Martian craters, flatter floors, fewer central peaks, more subdued debris blankets, absence of obvious secondary craters and rays, and greater abundance of “ghost” craters. Photos showed no sinuous rifles and no distinctive earth-like phenomena such as mountain ranges, tectonic basins, stream-cut topographs, dune fields, playa flats, or other arid-region features.

August 17: Apollo 11 astronauts discussed possible manned Mars landing by 1982 on CBS TV program “Face the Nation.” Astronaut Neil A. Armstrong said, “I am quite certain that goals of the Mars variety are within our range, should we choose . . . that investment of our national resources.” First exploratory flights could be combined with earthorbiting spacecraft to develop long-term capability with same kind of spacecraft. It was “well within our capability” to be prepared for Mars launch in 1981.
Astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., said he was “not so sure . . . this is the time that we can accurately set a date like 1981.” Setting goal was
worthwhile but as intermediate goals were reached “I believe we will be able to better define exactly what our longer term goals are in terms of ten years from now.”
Astronaut Michael Collins said, “I don’t think 1981 is too soon. I think it is well within our capabality to do so.” Long-duration trip “requires careful design and testing of the equipment, which could easily be done in Earth orbit with a number of ancillary benefits.” He defended Bible reading in space and announced he would not fly in space again, because he found it increasingly difficult “to keep up year after year” with rigorous training required.

•	Controversy was building up over astronauts’ future, Apollo program,
and manned space flight generally, Harry Schwartz said in New York Times. Three major debates were over whether engineer-astronauts or scientist-astronauts should be sent on future Apollo missions; who should control mission schedules and astronaut activities, “nasa hierarchy” or ground-based scientists in NASA; and whether U.S. should emphasize unmanned probes or crash program to put men on Mars in early 1980s. “The fact that it is the scientists who have been resigning while astronauts with test pilot backgrounds have been receiving unprecedented public acclaim makes it evident where the balance of power lies for the moment within nasa. But the issue is far from settled, since NASA itself must and does use the prospect of scientific advances as a key argument in seeking appropriations for space activities. Hence the dissident scientists could have substantial leverage if they teamed up with Congressmen and others who oppose the space appropriations for other reasons. It would not be surprising ... if nasa sought to ease the scientists’ irritation by satisfying some of their demands.” {NYT, 8/17/69, D2)

closed their age might range from 2 billion to 4.5 billion yrs—far greater than most scientists expected—lunar scientists in touch with lrl colleagues said. It was “almost conclusive evidence that it has been billions of years since these rocks crystallized.” Finding might settle difference between geologists who had viewed lunar surface as having had continuous history and those like Dr. Harold C. Urey who believed moon was ancient, undisturbed place made of material which would help unfold history of early planets. Later, msc Director of Science and Applications, Dr. Wilmot N.

August 24: This Week published interview with science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke: Most important recent outer space discovery was pulsars—“It’s possible that they might be signals from some higher civilization.” Scientific surprise in Apollo program was “its immaculate perfection. You don’t expect that, no matter how carefully you prepare.” Clarke was writing space exploration documentary which would show “whole span of human interest in space, back to the Babylonian astronomers and on up through the colonization of the solar system.” It would include Stonehenge which was “as big a burden for the primitive economy that built it—in fact, probably a much bigger burden than the Apollo program is for us.” (Bradford, This Week, 8/24/69, 7)
•	Transfer of usaf mol officers to NASA astronaut corps [see Aug. 14] was
criticized in Washington Sunday Star by William Hines: “With the initial moon landing now an accomplished fact, the pace of manned space operations has slowed down to three flights per year. This means that no more than nine men can fly annually, and with 54 astronauts now on board, this, in turn, means an average of six years between flights.” Though pace might accelerate in time and future space stations would increase annual number of crew assignments, “the glamor and glory of being an astronaut—particularly a nonflying one—no longer compensates for the enforced idleness imposed by the modified flight schedule.” (W Star, 8/24/69, D4)

August 26: Moon landing would change human lives, British novelist and scientist C. P. Snow said in Look. “I am afraid that in the long run, perhaps a generation, perhaps longer, it will have a bad effect. It will give us the feeling, and the perfectly justified feeling, that our world has finally closed in. This is forever the end of the mortal frontier.” Space enthusiasts thought lunar landing would liberate human imagination but “I believe . . . that human imagination is going to be restricted—as to an extent it was when the last spots on the globe had been visited, the South Pole and the summit of Everest. Nowhere on earth for adventurous man to go. Very soon, there will be no place in the universe for adventurous man to go.” {Look, 8/26/69, 68—72)

August 27: NASA’s 148-lb drum-shaped Pioneer E failed on 5:29 pm edt launch from etr by Thrust-Augmented Improved Thor-Delta (DSV— 3L) booster. Satellite had been intended for solar orbit to collect scientific data on electromagnetic and plasma properties of interplanetary medium near earth’s orbital path during six or more passages of solar activity centers.
Jettison of three strap-on solid-propellant rockets, lst-stage Thor engine cutoff, and 2nd-stage ignition occurred as planned but vehicle began gyrating, veered off course, and was destroyed by Range Safety Officer at 8 min 2 secs get. Pioneer E and tetr c test and training satellite, carried as secondary payload to test Apollo communications network, splashed into Atlantic about 300 mi southeast of Barbados. Preliminary analysis of data indicated loss of hydraulic pressure during lst-stage burn had permitted engine nozzle to develop uncontrolled gim-baling and vehicle gyrations. Investigation would be conducted to determine exact cause and action to prevent recurrence.
Pioneer E was last in series of five spacecraft designed to provide continuing measurements over the solar cycle at widely separated points in interplanetary space. Pioneer VI (launched Dec. 16, 1965), Pioneer VII (launched Aug. 17, 1966), Pioneer VIII (launched Dec. 16, 1967), and Pioneer IX (launched Nov. 8, 1968) had received
25,000	commands from ground and were still producing useful data from widely scattered positions in heliocentric orbits. Most recent Pioneer missions had provided new information on functions of magnetosphere, additional data on finding that diffuse solar plasma regions appeared to have attraction of their own, measurements of cosmic dust populations, data on changes in electrical and magnetic characteristics
of solar corona, and targets for precision radar tracking which led to establishment of reliable value for earth-moon-mass ratio and sun-earth-mass ratio. Pioneer program was managed by arc under OSSA direction. (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 69—116; SBD, 8/29/69, 213)
•	Moon was twin planet of earth, formed from same whirling gas cloud, in
early view of two lrl scientists studying Apollo 11 samples. Dr. S. Ross Taylor of Astri National Univ., Canberra, Australia, said, “Moon’s composition is unlike the earth’s. But it is not outside our experience. It is like the material you would expect if the earth and moon were formed as a double planet.” He thought moon was younger twin, while Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer of State Univ. of New York thought it might be equally old.
Age of two lunar rocks had been estimated at 3.1 billion yrs, “give or take . . . 200 million years,” by measuring proportion of argon 40 to potassium in rocks, Dr. Schaeffer said. Lunar highlands might be
4.5	billion yrs old. Moon, he thought, never grew big enough to melt internally and produce geologic activity to change lunar surface and leave younger rocks. Dr. Taylor’s studies had shown unusually high amounts of refractory material and absence or low concentration of volatile materials, implying volatile material had boiled away in melting process. He inferred rock chemistry was different from deep mantle of earth and from cosmic abundances—distribution of elements that would be expected in distant, more primitive planet captured by earth.

During August: Pace magazine published articles by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, also nasc Chairman, and by NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine.
Dr. Paine said, “To improve conditions in our society we need to create more wealth through greater productivity based on new technology. We should be restless and dissatisfied with our slowness in overcoming social ills, and I hope that the space program will continue to spur us onward here. If we can go to the moon, why can’t we build great and shining cities? Why can’t we eliminate ignorance, crime and poverty? If our space program highlights such questions and helps form a national commitment to find new solutions, it will have served the nation well. Our space advances should embolden the nation to proceed forward with increased confidence in these other areas. Our Apollo program has demonstrated anew what Americans can accomplish given a national commitment, capable leadership and adequate resources.
“Man’s future in space is limitless. We have embarked on a new stage of evolution that will engage all future generations of men. We face the unknown in countless areas: What are the effects of sustained zero and artificial gravity? Of time-extending flight at nearly the velocity of light? Of societies genetically selected for extraterrestrial living?
“We must find the answers. We must move vigorously forward in space. The practical benefits alone justify this venture, but there are many other compelling human reasons. Progress in space should continue to spur us onward to find new solutions to our age-old problems here on Spaceship Earth. We must make the blue planet Earth a home base, worthy of men who will set forth one day on journeys to the stars.”
Vice President Agnew said: “With the remarkably successful Apollo moon-landing program on the verge of culmination, we are now faced with a need to define just what we should proceed to do to make use most effectively of the results of our past and continuing space-exploration investment. Wealthy as our economy is, rich as our technology has become, we must plan carefully in order to meet a wide range of urgent national requirements. ... It is our hope that, with a carefully reasoned set of goals adequately funded by the people through their Congress, the nation and the world will reap the maximum possible benefit from mankind’s most ambitious undertaking. We must keep our horizons wide and our sights high. Despite its many internal domestic priorities, this nation should never turn inward, away from the opportunities and challenges of its most promising frontier.” (Pace, 8/69, 2—4)

•	“Technologically and managerially, Apollo was difficult,” Englebert
Kirchner said in Space/Aeronautics editorial. “Politically and socially,
it was simple. Just the reverse is true about the great problems of our society. What is making these so hard to solve is not technology but serious disagreement about goals and priorities, about what is good for whom, who is to get what and who should pay for it. The space program does not hold the answer to these questions. Trying to find them in Apollo will only distort and therefore belittle an incomparable achievement. Apollo took us to the moon, to that shining disk in the sky that looks so unbelievably distant. Isn’t that enough?” (S/A, 8/69, 27)
• AFSC Neuisrevieui editorial commented on Apollo 11: “If, like the early Vikings or Columbus at the shores of the New World, Amundsen at Antarctica, Hillary at the peak of Mt.

Rockwell Corp. for construction of new supercritical aircraft wing. Wing, which utilized airfoil shape with flat top and rear edge curved downward, had been developed by Dr. Richard T. Whitcomb and tested at LaRC. Wind tunnel tests indicated new shape could allow highly efficient cruise flight at nearly 600 mph at 45,000-ft altitude. By increasing cruise speeds without increasing power, wing might signifi-
cantly reduce operational cost of subsonic jet transport flights and allow faster travel, lower fuel consumption and costs, increased operational range, or increased payload. Wing would be mounted on modified Navy F—j fighter aircraft at frc for flight testing, (frc Releases 4-69, 15-69)

Washington, D.C., Postmaster General Winton M. Blount presented Apollo 11 Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., and Michael Collins and NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, with albums containing 32 stamps each. He said: “In the largest sense we pay tribute today to the spirit of man. We cannot separate the accomplishments of Apollo 11 from those of Yostok 1; we cannot separate the contributions of Michael Collins, or Edwin Aldrin or Neil Armstrong from those of Goddard and Einstein, Kepler and Newton, Copernicus and Galileo. We know this. And in the knowing again we find hope. For if men of all nations, together, can achieve dominion over the heavens, men of all nations, together, can achieve peace on earth for men for all time.”
Armstrong said astronauts had deferred cancellation of stamps until they were reunited in cm, July 22. They had then grasped canceler simultaneously and pressed it upon die-proof version of commemorative stamp affixed to unaddressed envelope. Cancellation date remained July 20, day of lunar landing.

Study of lunar samples was “bringing to light as many mysteries as it unravels,” New York Times editorial said. Theorists were cautious, with evidence from one small area, Tranquility Base. “It is likely that the picture will become still more complex when a representative collection of samples becomes available from ten, twenty or thirty areas spread over the entire lunar surface. But even the limitations of the present data suggest strongly that the moon is very different from earth, and therefore has much to teach human science about the origin and evolution of the solar system. The case for intensive scientific study of the moon—conducted in part by geologists and other scientists sent there for on-the-spot investigation-—is strong.” (NYT, 9/10/69, 40) September 11: Press conference on results of Mariner VI (launched Feb. 24) and Mariner VII (launched March 27) was held at NASA Hq. Some 200 TV pictures of Mars were taken by two Mariners, including 57 high- and medium-resolution views of selected Martian surface areas from altitude of only few hundred miles. Spacecraft measured Martian atmospheric temperature, pressure, and chemical constituency and measured surface temperatures in effort to correlate thermal characteristics with features observed in TV pictures. Data indicated Mars was heavily cratered, bleak, cold, dry, nearly airless, and generally hostile to any earth-style life forms.
Dr. Robert B. Leighton of Cal Tech said: “We got nine times the number of far encounter pictures that were originally proposed [few years ago], 20 per cent more near encounter pictures than were proposed, and 1,100 digital pictures which were entirely impossible according to schemes at the time of the proposal. . . . After Mariner 4 Mars seemed to be like the moon. At last Mariners 6 and 7 have shown Mars to be like Mars and have brought out Mars’ own characteristic features, some of them unknown and unrecognized elsewhere in the solar system.”
Dr. Robert P. Sharp of Cal Tech said Martian terrain could be divided into three types—crater, featureless, and. chaotic. Cratered terrain was widespread and common on Mars and resembled moon. Featureless terrain was represented by Hellas area, which appeared to be upland area, 150-mi-wide zone that gently sloped into flat featureless floor. Chaotic terrain had series of “short ridges, little valleys, and irregular, jumbled topography.” Chaotic and featureless terrain appeared to be distinctly Martian, suggesting “that on Mars we have either a difference in processes that are operating on the surface or within the crust or we have a difference of material from one place to another on Mars and different than on the moon, or, more likely, a combination of both. ... We also have good reason for believing that the evolutionary history has been somewhat different. Again, there are scars on the face of Mars that we do not see on the face of the moon. And there have perhaps been episodic events in Martian history that are unique to the planet Mars. We end up with the conclusion that Mars is its own planet.”
Dr. George C. Pimentel of Univ. of California at Berkeley said reevaluation of initial data from infrared spectrometer had shown infra-
red spectral features earlier ascribed to methane and ammonia were actually due to previously undiscovered absorptions of solid carbon dioxide. Reflection peak recorded three times in atmosphere off Mars’ bright limb showed presence of solid carbon dioxide at high altitudes and at latitudes north of polar cap. Broad absorption near 9 p. recorded on bright limb was ascribed to solid silica or silicate material and broad absorptions near 12 p. recorded near dark limb were tentatively ascribed in part to solid carbon dioxide above ground. Further experimental work was in progress to refine thermal map.
Initial results of uv spectrometer experiment were detection of ionized carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, atomic hydrogen, and oxygen. Nitrogen and nitric oxide were not detected and no evidence was found of clouds, blue haze, or any appreciable atmospheric absorption of uv radiation. Dr. Charles A. Barth of Univ. of Colorado said important point “is that the atmosphere of Mars is different than the atmosphere of the earth. If I showed you a spectrum taken the same way from the upper atmosphere of the earth, we would see a plentiful number of nitrogen bands. We could see emissions from nitric oxide. We could see emissions from atomic nitrogen. None of those features is present in the atmosphere of Mars. . . .”
Dr. Norman H. Horowitz of jpl presented biological implications of Mariner 1969 results. “There is nothing in the new data that encourages the belief that Mars is a body of life. But the results don’t exclude this possibility. . . . The Mariner 6 and 7 data strengthen the previous conclusion that the scarcity of water on Mars is the most serious limiting factor for life. . . . Mars is a cold desert by terrestrial standards. If there is life on Mars, it must be a form of life that can utilize water in the form of water vapor or ice.” (Transcript; NASA News Release)

Among measurements to be made were those of physical properties of rocks or soil to help in understanding optical observations of moon from earth and future seismic experiments; mineralogy and petrology to show mineral content, amount of water present when rocks crystallized, and how surfaces were eroded by particles; chemical composition of rocks and fines to determine concentration of 92 elements occurring on earth and in meteorites, times of crystallization of igneous rocks, and periods rocks had lain on lunar surface. Studies of rare gases in soil would furnish first data on isotopic compositions of solar materials. Biologists and organic chemists would determine structures and abundances of carbon compounds in and on lunar surface and their origin, catalog microstructures in terms of organized elements and microfossils, and define presence or absence of viable lunar organisms. {NASA Release 69—130)

September 15: Space Task Group presented report The Post-Apollo Space Program: Directions for the Future to President Nixon at White House. It recommended basic goal of balanced manned and unmanned space program conducted for all mankind, with emphasis on increased utilization of space capabilities for services to man through expanded space applications program; enhancement of U.S. defense posture for world peace and security through exploitation of space techniques for
military missions; continuing strong program of lunar and planetary exploration, astronomy, physics, and earth and life sciences; development of new systems and technology for space operations, emphasizing commonality, reusability, and economy through development of new space transportation capability and space station modules; and promotion of world community through program of broad international participation and cooperation.
As focus for development of new capability, Task Group recommended U.S. accept long-range goal of manned planetary exploration with manned Mars mission before end of century. Activities leading to goal should include initial concentration on exploiting existing capability and developing new one while maintaining program balance within available resources; operational phase using new systems and capabilities in earth-moon space, with men living and working in that environment for extended periods; and manned exploration missions out of earth-moon space, using experience of earlier two phases. Schedule and budgetary implications of phases were subject to Presidential choice, with detailed program to be determined in normal annual budget and program review.
Report outlined three possible NASA programs for manned Mars landing before century’s end. Option I would launch manned mission in mid-1980s and would establish orbiting lunar station, 50-man earthorbiting space base, and lunar surface base. Funding would rise from current $4-billion level to $8- to $10-billion level in 1980. Decision to proceed with development of space station, earth-to-orbit shuttle, and space tug would be required in FY 1971. Option II would include Mars mission launch in 1986, allowing for evaluation of unmanned Mars mission results before final designation of landing date and require about $8-billion maximum annual expenditure in early 1980s. Option III would include initial development of space station and reusable shuttles, as in Options I and II, but would defer decision on manned Mars landing date while maintaining goal of after 1980 but before close of century. Concurrent development of space transportation system and modular space stations would require rise in 1976 annual expenditures to $5.7 billion, while their development in series would entail $4- to $5-billion funding level.
Recommended DOD options were: (A) program of full military space capability in case of overt threat to national security, (B) development of efforts to counter known and accepted projections of security threat and increase in development activities if threat increased, and (C) program of lower level system deployment with technology and support effort necessary for contingency planning on assumption that lessening of world tensions would reduce emphasis on national defense.
At White House briefing following presentation, press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said President Nixon had concurred in Task Group’s rejection of two other, extreme space programs, one to land men on Mars as soon as possible, regardless of cost, and one to eliminate manned flight program after completion of Apollo. He did not know when President would make decision on course to follow, but budgetary considerations would be major factor. (Text; PD, 9/22/69, 1291; NYT, 9/16/69, 1)

• Lunar Rock Conference was held at Smithsonian Institution, with participation of Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator; Dr. Henry J. Smith, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator (Science); and Lunar Receiving Laboratory scientists. During conference NASA released PET Summary of Apollo 11 Lunar Samples, report of 60-day preliminary examination of 48 lbs of Apollo 11 lunar samples in lrl by university and Government scientists on NASA Preliminary Examination Team (pet).
Report confirmed existence of unexplained erosion process on lunar surface indicated in Ranger, Lunar Orbiter, and Surveyor photos, “unlike any process so far observed on earth”; said unique chemical composition (that of silicate liquid) of Tranquility Base fines and igneous rocks “implies either the composition of the rock from which the liquid was derived differs significantly from that of the mantle of the earth, or that the mechanism by which the liquid was formed differs from analogous terrestrial processes”; and concluded there was “very good chance that the time of crystallization of some of the Apollo 11 rocks may date back to times earlier than the oldest rocks on earth.”
Samples could be divided into fine- and medium-grained crystalline of igneous origin, breccias of complex origin, and fines. Crystalline rocks differed from any terrestrial rock and from meteorites in modal mineralogy and bulk chemistry. Erosion had occurred on lunar surface but there was no evidence it was caused by surface water. Probable presence of assemblage iron-troilite-ilmenite and absence of any hydrated phase indicated crystalline rocks were formed under extremely low partial pressures of oxygen, water, and sulfur. Absence of hydrated minerals suggested absence of any surface water at Tranquility Base since rocks were exposed. Rocks and fines showed evidence of shock or impact metamorphism; all rocks displayed glass-lined surface pits possibly caused by impact of small particles; and fine material and breccia contained gases that indicated they were derived from solar wind. Measurements on igneous rock indicated crystallization 3 billion to 4 billion yrs ago. Rocks had been within one meter of surface for 20 million to 160 million yrs. Level of indigenous volatiliz-able and/or pyrolyzable organic material was extremely low. All rocks and fines were generally similar chemically. Major and minor constituents were same as in terrestrial igneous rocks and meteorites, but differences in composition were significant. Elements that were enriched in iron meteorites were not observed or were very low in occurrence. No evidence of biological material had been found. Tranquility Base soil was fine grained, granular, cohesive, and incompressible, with hardness increasing at six-inch depth. It was similar in appearance and behavior to soil at Surveyor landing sites. (Program; Text; Science, 9/19/69)

September 16: Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., and Michael Collins reported on Apollo 11 mission to joint session of Congress called in their honor. Astronaut Armstrong said: “Several weeks ago I enjoyed the warmth of reflection on the true meanings of the spirit of Apollo. I stood in the highlands of this Nation, near the Continental Divide, introducing to my sons the wonders of nature and pleasures of looking for deer and for elk. In their enthusiasm for the view they frequently stumbled on the rocky trails, but when they looked only to their footing, they did not see the elk. To those of you who have advocated looking high we owe our sincere gratitude, for you have granted us the opportunity to see some of the grandest views of the Creator. To those of you who have been our honest critics, we also thank, for you have reminded us that we dare not forget to watch the trail.”
Astronaut Aldrin said: “Our steps in space have been a symbol of this country’s way of life as we open our doors and windows to the world to view our Successes and failures and as we share with all nations our discovery. The Saturn, Columbia, and Eagle, and the extravehicular mobility unit have proved . . . that this Nation can produce equipment of the highest quality and dependability. This should give all of us hope and inspiration to overcome some of the more difficult problems here on earth. The Apollo lesson is that national goals can he met where there is a strong enough will to do so.”
Astronaut Collins said: “We have taken to the moon the wealth of this Nation, the vision of its political leaders, the intelligence of its scientists, the dedication of its engineers, the careful craftsmanship of its workers, and the enthusiastic support of its people. We have brought back rocks. And I think it is a fair trade. For just as the Rosetta stone revealed the language of ancient Egypt, so may these rocks unlock the mystery of the origin of the moon, of our earth, and even of our solar system,”

Vice President Agnew said Task Group had rejected “crash program of the magnitude that would turn loose every bit of our technological ability” to achieve quickest possible manned Mars landing because “there are competing priorities in a difficult time of inflation.” Task Group had also rejected “foregoing the substantial benefits that have come out of the Apollo program, the benefits of National prestige.”
Dr. Paine said all three options recommended to President in report would enable NASA to “hold together the team” and provide “major challenge.”
Dr. DuBridge said all three options held “heavy emphasis on earth applications, satellites, for studying the geology, the geography, the atmosphere of the oceans of the earth and bringing space technology directly and immediately to the benefit of the people on earth. All three programs also . . . include heavy emphasis on scientific programs, to extend our scientific knowledge of the earth itself, of the moon, through additional lunar expeditions, interplanetary space and additional scientific information about the moon and the planets.” He also cited emphasis on international collaboration.

all man’s great enterprises, none lends itself more logically or more compellingly to international cooperation than the venture into space.
Here, truly, mankind is one: as fellow creatures from the planet Earth, exploring the heavens that all of us enjoy. The journey of Apollo 11 to the moon and back was not an end, but the beginning.
“There will be new journeys of discovery. Beyond this, we are just beginning to comprehend the benefits that space technology can yield here on earth. And the potential is enormous. For example, we are now developing earth resource survey satellites, with the first experimental satellite to be launched sometime early in the decade of the seventies. Present indications are that these satellites should be capable of yielding data which could assist in as widely varied tasks as these: the location of schools of fish in the oceans, the location of mineral deposits on land, the health of agricultural crops.
“I feel it is only right that we should share both the adventures and the benefits of space. As an example of our plans, we have determined to take actions with regard to earth resources satellites. . . . The purpose ... is that this program will be dedicated to produce information not only for the United States, but also for the world community.

with U.S.S.R. was entered in Congressional Record:
April 30, NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas O. Paine, forwarded copy of Opportunities for Participation in Space Flight Investigations to Academician Dr. Anatoly A. Blagonravov and assured him that proposals by Soviet scientists of experiments to fly on NASA spacecraft would be welcomed. Supplements to NASA document were to be sent routinely to Soviet Academy.
May 29, Dr. Paine invited Academician Blagonravov to attend Apollo 11 launch and to discuss, informally, mutual interests in cooperative space projects. Dr. Blagonravov had declined.
August 21, Dr. Paine invited Academician Prof. Mstislav V. Keldysh to send Soviet scientists to Sept. 11—21 briefing at NASA Hq. for investigators who might wish to propose experiments for 1973 Viking missions to Mars. Dr. Paine suggested meeting serve as opportunity for discussion of planetary exploration plans contributing to coordinated efforts beneficial to both countries. Prof. Keldysh had declined, but asked for copies of meeting materials so Soviet scientists might develop proposals. He had suggested possibility of later discussions. (CR, 9/18/69, S1095-6)

Acceptance by President of recommendation “would eliminate talk of abandoning manned space flight, which would be a foolish course of action, or of proceeding toward Mars in a crash effort to get there as quickly as possible.” It was important “for the nation to push ahead on the immediate recommendations of the Task Group— exploring the moon, developing the tools that are needed for systematic exploration of our space travel capability, and extracting from the space program more benefits for those of us who are earthbound.” (W Post, 9/19/69)
September 20: Economist commented on lunar investigation: “Scientists, unlike engineers, are not at this stage interested in whether the moon can be made habitable; but this, rather than its age, or peculiarities of its composition, is what the astronauts went out to the moon to find. The results are more encouraging than anyone but the confirmed star gazers could have hoped. Space is not unfriendly; nor is the moon, superficially barren though it looks. What we need are more assurances about sources of water which space planners continue to be convinced is trapped in, and can be extracted from, the rocks. Also more data on those surprising experiments where plants have thrived on moon soil.

•	“The notion has occurred to more than one person that NASA, having
reached the moon and now fearing its way to the planets possibly blocked by budgetary obstacles, might find the requisite new worlds to conquer right here, at home,” William Hines said in Washington Sunday Star. It was “fundamental precept of modern technology that anything which can be imagined can be accomplished. A cure for cancer, an end to poverty, a cleanup of the environment, termination of the Vietnam war, even effective nuclear disarmament? If it is conceivable it is achievable.” While nasa could be depended on to give good ac-
count of itself in scientific and engineering situations, “its ability to handle problems with a big ‘people’ component is largely untested.” Since “people-problems” were predominant these days, maybe NASA wouldn’t work out so well after all. “But on the second thought, no other government agency is showing much flair for coping with the human element, either.” (W Star, 9/21/69, C4)

September 26: Glazing discovered on lunar surface by Apollo 11 astronauts was analyzed in Science by Thomas Gold of Cornell Univ., senior investigator for close-up photography. Glossy surfaces similar to glass found clumped in centers of small lunar craters appeared to have been swept in after craters had been formed. Glazed areas were also concentrated toward tops of protuberances and, in some cases, droplets appeared to have run down inclined surface and congealed on sides. Glazing might have originated from effect of exhaust of lm descent stage, splashing of liquid drops from larger impact elsewhere, shock heating or volcanism on moon, same impact that created craters in which glazing was found, or intense radiation heating. Intense radiation was most probable cause, Gold said. Source could have been im-
pact fireball on moon, impact fireball on earth, or most likely, solar outburst in geologically recent times. (Science, 9/26/69, 1345—9)
•	In address at Clarkson College of Technology in Potsdam, N.Y., Dr.
Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, said: “We know that hydrogen bombs work (unfortunately)—the Lord made the Universe that way. And, of course, we know that (fortunately) fusion energy keeps the sun shining every day. Our great visionary dream is to find out how to unlock this energy for spaceship propulsion. This is a great challenge but consider the new tools that we have available: giant magnetic fields with superconducting magnets, tremendous power densities from lasers, the great energy of nuclear power, and new high temperature materials. These, with new plasma dynamic developments, may usher in fusion power in the eighties, the nineties, or in the next century. Harnessing fusion power for propulsion is an even farther-out challenge, but it could prove to be one of the more direct applications. We won’t have to convert the fusion energy to electricity; just fuse a couple of deuterium atoms and then let them blast out the back of the vehicle!
“So fusion remains a tantalizing promise for the future. ... If we ever do achieve such propulsion, we’ll be able to move with some ease out from our little 8,000-mile-diameter Solar System. All of the 9 planets, 32 moons and 1600 known asteroids will come within reach of our vehicles. And, indeed, if we could achieve high efficiencies in a fusion propulsion process, we could talk of eventual relativistic velocities, of time compression, and of travel to the nearest stars.” (Text)
•	Venus, “least understood of the inner planets,” should be U.S. space pro-
gram priority target, Kitt Peak National Observatory physicist Dr. Donald M. Hunten and Harvard Univ. physicist Dr. Richard M. Goody said in Science. Some fundamental data were available; quantitative theories had been stated; questions about atmosphere could be answered by feasible missions; and geophysicists’ interest had been aroused and offered specialized knowledge needed to understand complex processes. But NASA had no present plans for investigation of Venus’ lower atmosphere. Uncertainty as to Soviet intentions had been cited as reason for giving Venus low priority. But until collaboration with U.S.S.R. and other European countries could begin, “we have no choice but to base our judgment upon our own scientific and technical abilities and desires.” (Science, 9/26/69, 1317—23)
•	Wall Street Journal editorial: “While there will be debate on the Ad-
ministration’s approval of a go-ahead on the supersonic transport, the President plainly picked the proper method for financing further development of the controversial plane. Earlier there had been talk of setting up a special sst authority that would raise money by selling Government-guaranteed bonds to the public. The idea never had much to recommend it. At the moment the sst faces an uncertain economic future. ... If the plane is a flop, the Government would be stuck one way or the other. . . . the bond plan would ease the current pressure on the Federal budget. But it also would fool at least part of the public about the financial risk that the Government actually is assuming. . . . Whether one especially relishes the notion or not, supersonic travel is sure to come sooner or later. In heading toward that development, the Administration is wise to avoid financial subterfuge.” (WSJ, 9/26/69)

During September: Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, defended value of Safeguard abm defense and also discussed use of space for strategic deterrence, writing in Air Force/Space Digest: “In terms of security, the space age presents dangers—but it also affords opportunities for increasing strategic stability.” Dangers stemmed from weapons placed in orbit; “It might be possible to trigger such weapons with very little warning, thus increasing the risk of surprise attack.” Outer Space Treaty of 1967 might help avoid this danger, “while providing us opportunities for other sorts of military systems that could strengthen deterrence rather than weaken it.” Each generation of space vehicles would provide additional improvements in monitoring enemy activities. “We are now working on a satellite early-warning system that would detect missiles as they are launched from land or sea.” Dispersed bomber force “would be able to take off from
its bases before the impact of enemy weapons, even if the time of flight of the latter were greatly reduced.” (AF/SD, 9/69, 61—4)
•	usaf magazine Airman published interview with Secretary of the Air
Force, Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., former NASA Deputy Administrator. NASA—usaf X—15 program had been highly successful in providing data for many disciplines and “very good test bed” for atmospheric probe instrumentation. XB—70 program, initiated as manned supersonic bombing system, was “very bold step” in speeds over mach 3. When technological difficulties and rising costs resulted in decision against XB—70 production, NASA with usaf had initiated experimental program. Dr. Seamans felt usaf was not using NASA expertise to fullest extent, usaf needed new manned bomber, new fighter, and modernization of air defense. He was not convinced usaf had yet established “best relationships with industry to get these things done.” (Airman, 9/69, 7-9)
•	“There appears to be much more to be squeezed from Apollo than just
the incalculable value of national prestige or scientific discovery,” Michael Getler wrote in Space/Aeronautics. “The ability to mine these supporting talents, to judge their value outside manned space flight and disseminate and apply them may well prove the most telling and measurable argument in the debate which is bound to continue over Apollo’s real value.” Apollo had combined “much of what we have with what we do best. Though complex, it was manageable. It had clear goals, was well funded, enjoyed fairly widespread public support, and dangled the element of competition in front of our involuntary reflex. Most importantly, it tapped an industrial base and an enthusiasm for gadgetry that are unmatched anywhere. . . . Because many of today’s challenges confront human nature and not technology, Apollo can be made to seem irrelevant. In fact, however, we are not left alone with our behavioral troubles. There is still an economy to keep sound, industry and commerce to be kept competitive, and a government to be made more efficient. Failure to take this extraordinary project apart, piece by piece, and examine its usefulness in these areas would indeed be wasteful.” (S/A, 9/69, 42—53)
•	Dr. Mose L. Harvey in Science and Public Affairs, bulletin of atomic sci-
entists, discussed lunar landing and U.S.-Soviet equation: “The capability of the United States to continue in space, and otherwise keep pace with the scientific-technological revolution, depends entirely on continued public faith in the ‘military-industrial complex’ and the ‘scientific and technological elite,’ if one wishes to keep using these unfortunate terms. It was only because we were able effectively to organize and use a genuine and mutually rewarding partnership between industry, universities and government that we were able to effect the moon landing and to do the other near-miraculous things we have done in space and in other fields involving advanced science and advanced technology. It is precisely on this partnership that the superiority of the American way over the Soviet way has so far rested.” IScience and Public Affairs, 9/69, 28—35)
•	Atlas published translation of article in L’Espresso, Rome, by Italian
novelist Alberto Moravia on implications of Apollo 11. “In Columbus’s days, men were offered finite goals, like the discovery of America; or they were offered spiritual aims, like the search for goodness, truth and
beauty. At that time, no one could have guessed that Columbus’s discovery was only a beginning. That other discoveries would follow, a second America, a third, a fourth, and so on through millions of years and billions of kilometers. But today that is happening. Compared to our new set of goals, the aims of Marx and communism are pure imagination. For the first time the real and the rational are about to become one. We are now at the end of history—and post-history is just beginning.” (Atlas, 9/69, 40—3)
•	Atlas said its “Talk of the World” section had “got a little hoarse” on
subject of Apollo 11. It quoted “a few of the more unusual moon-thoughts” from international press. El Tiempo in Bogota had reported Colombian wool fabrics were used in Apollo 11 spacecraft upholstery. Canada’s Kitchener Waterloo Record had said lm had touched down on moon with legs made in Canada by Montreal firm. Oiga, in Lima, Peru, had said when Sputnik went into orbit “it was noted that Pedro Paulet Mostajo had invented a jet-propelled rocket back in 1895.” Atlas commented that “this could go on forever.” (Atlas, 9/69, 10)
•	In Astrophysical Journal, Princeton Univ. astronomers Jeremiah P. Os-
triker and Dr. James E. Gunn predicted few pulsars should be found with periods more than 1.5 secs, from results of their quarantine exploration of pulsar model. (Astro Journ, 9/69, 1395—1417)
•	usaf communications and navigation satellite programs were outlined by
l/g John W. O’Neill, Vice Commander of afsc, in TRW Space Log. afsc was testing new uhf communication terminal in conjunction with Tacsat I tactical comsat and had tested uhf shipboard, jeep, van-mounted, and team-pack terminals as receivers for satellite communications. Second-generation defense comsats would have earth coverage antennas and also steerable narrow-beam antennas to direct energy to two “spotlighted” areas on earth’s surface, permitting use of small terminals instead of large ground stations. Proposed navigation satellite system would consist of bigh-altitude satellites transmitting navigation signals with worldwide coverage, ground stations to track and command satellites, and user receiving equipment. Navsat would provide all four armed services with common grid for mobile operations and could be used by aircraft, ships, submarines, and foot soldiers. Potential for aircraft carrier operations was being studied.
Computer revolution would provide new data processing equipment “with infinite potential for influencing satellite design and function” in future. “We are pressing hard for progress in laser technology, which appears to have excellent potential for communication applications. We are also pushing the development of new sources of power in space in which a breakaway from our heavy reliance upon the solar cell could make future satellite development a whole new game.” (TRW Space Log, Summer/Fall 69, 3—17)
October 1969
October 1: Boreas (Esro IB) satellite—designed, developed, and constructed by European Space Research. Organization—was successfully launched by NASA from wtr by Scout booster. Orbital parameters: apogee, 237.4 mi (382 km); perigee, 180.8 mi (291 km); period, 91.3 min; and inclination, 85.1°. Primary NASA mission objectives were to place Boreas into planned orbit and provide tracking and telemetry support. Boreas was backup for and identical to Aurorae (Esro I A) successfully launched by NASA Oct. 3, 1968. It carried eight experiments to study aurora borealis (Northern Lights) and related phenomena of polar ionosphere, representing six organizations from U.K., Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.
Boreas was third successful esro satellite launched by NASA. First success, Iris I (Esro 1IB), had been launched by NASA May 16, 1968, to replace esro iia, which had failed to enter orbit May 29, 1967. esro was responsible for experiment instrumentation, delivery of spacecraft to launch site, equipment and personnel necessary to mate spacecraft to launch vehicle, and spacecraft testing. NASA provided Scout launch vehicle and launch services in second launching on cost-reimbursable basis under Dec. 30, 1966, agreement with esro. (nasa Proj Off; GSFC SSR, 10/15/69; SBD, 10/3/69, 147)

jpl:	, the cities may benefit more from what’s happening right
here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory than they do from what’s happening in some community action agency. Now, I’m not downgrading the need to work closely with people . . . but I think it would be a des-
perate mistake ... to adopt an attitude that we do not challenge the unknown, we do not move forward simply because we can’t predict what we’re going to find.” Columbus “didn’t find what he went for but he found something even better. Maybe that applies to the situation with regard to the ultimate goal . . . about landing a man on Mars. . . . we may do something a lot better.”
In reply to question, he said: “We will never reach a point where we’ll have enough money for . . . the problems of the cities and of the population. . . . we could spend every resource we have and forego any scientific exploration and forget the need to research and develop new techniques. ... I suppose you come down to the final determination that you’ve got to put some of your effort in the future and not all of it in the present. And I don’t think the lack of a focus in the space program would be a benefit at all to the future of the cities and the problems you mention.” (Transcript)

October 2: Astronaut Alan L. Bean described plans for Apollo 12 extravehicular activities to press at KSC. Mission, to begin Nov. 14, would include two 3Vs>-hr eva periods on moon. For first EVA main objective was to deploy alsep, deploy TV camera and take photos, deploy lunar equipment conveyor, take contingency sample, deploy S-band antenna and solar wind experiment, and collect lunar material.
After rest in lm astronauts would return to lunar surface for second eva period, to collect good documented sample and document geologically interesting features with photographs, samples, and description. “There’s not going to be a lot of time to pick up a rock and think about it . . . but there’s going to be time to look at the craters and try to determine what kind they are and where they came from, if this one’s different from that one, what part of the crater you want to sample. . . . We’re going to take photographs as we see all of it. And when this is finished we’re hopefully going to be over near Surveyor.” Examination of Surveyor 111 (launched April 17, 1967) was second
objective. Crew would retrieve parts for evaluation of how materials withstood long-term exposure in space.
Final surface experiment would be conducted after liftoff from moon when crew crashed LM ascent stage onto surface. Crash would be recorded by seismometer and was expected to provide data from which scientists could make inferences about moon’s internal structure. (Transcript)

•	nasc Executive Secretary William A. Anders, Apollo 8 astronaut, told
Western Conference of Young Presidents’ Organization in Phoenix, Ariz., that U.S. lost $13 billion each year in agricultural production from insects, disease, and fire. Use of satellite sensors could improve surveys of agricultural and forest resources, aid mineral and petroleum prospecting, obtain better inventory of earth’s water sources, detect natural and man-made geography changes, sense ocean currents and temperatures to aid fishing industry and improve routing of commercial shipping, and study effects of environmental and water pollution. While NASA space expenditures were averaging about $4.5 billion annually— about 2/3 of 1% of GNP—nearly $4 billion was spent in U.S. for nondurable toys and sport supplies, $4.7 billion for foreign travel, and over $6.5 billion in amusements.
Anders urged international harmony through space. “We travel through space on a small planet. The Earth looked so tiny in the heavens that there were times during the Apollo 8 mission when I had trouble finding it. If you can imagine yourself in a darkened room with only one clearly visible object, a small blue-green sphere about the size of a Christmas tree ornament, then you can begin to grasp what the Earth looks like from space. I think all of us subconsciously think the Earth is fiat or at least almost infinite. Let me assure you that, rather than a massive giant, it should be thought of more as the fragile Christmas tree ball which we should handle with considerable care. . . . From space, the earth is indivisible. There are no flags, no national boundaries. Let us on Earth then use the Communications Revolution to break down the barriers which separate us, so that all of Earth’s people will be truly brothers.” (CR, 10/6/69, E8190—2; nasc pio)

October 5—11: International Astronautical Federation (iaf) held 20th Congress in Mar del Plata, Argentina.
Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, gave Invited Lecture Oct. 6 on Apollo program, space benefits, Apollo Applications program, and lunar exploration. Apollo Applications program would “study the earth through the use of a six lens multispectral camera installation. On Apollo 9 some of the rudimentary work was done using four lenses. 50% more kinds of information will be brought back by the crews of Apollo Applications. Because almost everything on earth has a different reflective quality, as distinctive as a signature or a fingerprint, results from this photographic exploration can be expected to yield rich rewards. Many of the earth sciences look to this kind of information for answers to previously unanswerable questions. Hydrologists are interested in discovering not only the depth, but also the temperature of the waters of the world, and these conditions can be ascertained from space. Warm water attracts certain species of fish, so fishermen are also interested in these experiments.
“Agronomists believe that soil chemistry will reveal itself on a large scale in certain kinds of filtered photography. Agriculturists know that different crops, at different stages of their development and in different states of health, reflect distinctive amounts of light. They hope, using the photographs we will take, to get some measure of the world’s crop, as well as some knowledge of its condition. Geologists, who have found clues to mineral deposits in the Gemini and Apollo pictures, look to this more sophisticated photography for additional information, and for distinctions which will eventually permit certain kinds of prospecting from space. Cartographers and Geodesists are interested in everything from urban sprawl to continental drift.”
Sun would be prime target for exploration in Apollo Applications program, with experiments conducted by astronaut-astronomers using Apollo Telescope Mount (atm) in orbit. “For the first time we will have a massive set of instruments with high resolution for looking in some depth and detail at the activities of the sun from beyond the veil of the earth’s atmosphere.” Program would consist of three missions into near-earth space, one of 28 days and two of 56 days each. First step would be establishment of Saturn V workshop in orbit, planned for March 1972 launch, followed by launches of solar panels, ATM, and crew of three for 28-day stay. Second manned mission was scheduled for launch about three months after first, with third to follow one month after return of second crew. (Text)
•	At Third International History of Astronautics Symposium Oct. 10,
organized by IAF in connection with its 20th Congress, A. Ingemar Skoog of Swedish Interplanetary Society traced rocket development in Sweden from 1807, when military first understood possibilities of rockets in warfare, to mid-1860s, when rockets were taken out of service. “An examination of the rockets preserved at the Army Museum in Stockholm, has shown that all 14 rockets are still fitted with their original propellant. This will be tested by propellant experts later this year in order to find out the properties of a 140 years old propellant.” (Text)

Frederick I. Ordway, III, of Univ. of Alabama delivered paper “The Alleged Contributions of Pedro E. Paulet to Liquid Propellant Rocketry.” “Paulet, a Peruvian chemical engineer-turned-diplomat, spent much of his professional foreign service career in Europe. . . . his claim to being a precursor of liquid propellant rocketry rests in a letter he wrote from Rome on the 23rd of August 1927 that was published in the 7 October 1927 issue of the Lima, Peru, newspaper El Comercio. Therein, he describes liquid propellant rocket engine experiments he had conducted ... in Paris thirty years earlier. . . . Relying on this source and derivatives, many subsequent writers have accorded Paulet a perhaps undeserved place in the history of rocketry.” (Summary)

October 9: Joseph P. Loftus, Jr., Manager of MSC Program Engineering Office, described plans for future Apollo lunar exploration at MSC press conference. Technological objectives were to increase scientific payload to lunar orbit and to lunar surface, permit high flexibility in landing site selection, increase lunar orbit and lunar surface stay time, increase lunar surface mobility with self-propelled lunar roving vehicle, develop and demonstrate advanced techniques and hardware for expanded manned space mission capabilities, develop techniques for achieving point landings, and demonstrate closed-loop onboard navigation capability as applicable to advanced missions.
Scientific objectives were to investigate major classes of lunar surface features, surface processes, and regional problems; collect samples at each site for analyses on earth; establish network of surface instrumentation to measure seismic activity, heat flow, and disturbance in moon’s axis of rotation; survey and measure lunar surface from lunar orbit with high-resolution photography and remote sensing; investigate near-moon environment and interaction of moon with solar wind; map lunar gravitational field and internally produced magnetic field; and detect atmospheric components resulting from neutralized solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts.
Achievement of scientific objectives would be facilitated by addition of scientific instrument module (sim) under service module sector door, sim would consist of scientific instruments mounted on shelves behind door, which would be deployed pyrotechnically after crew left lunar surface. Spacecraft would also use new modular equipment storage assembly (mesa) . “Unlike the existing mesa it is modular and people, instead of having to take many things out of compartments and stick them into a bag .' . . here you simply take hold of a handle . . . and lift out an entire shelf. On that shelf are all the things required for the next eva period. So, it is one movement instead of a dozen.”
One tank of hydrogen and one tank of oxygen would be added to extend mission capability to I6V2 days. Since each eva period would increase up to 5 hrs and total lunar stay time would increase up to 200 hrs, lithium hydroxide would be increased for portable life-support system and for spacecraft, and insulation would £e increased on top of spacecraft around docking tunnel. Minor changes would be made to interior garments so crew would have more suitable environment and crew would remove spacesuits and sleep in hammocks during rest periods on lunar surface. (Transcript)

October 10: Nuclear energy in space was discussed in address opening U.S. Technical Forum at Nuclex 69 in Basel, Switzerland, by Milton Klein, Manager of aec—nasa Space Nuclear Propulsion Office and Director of aec Space Nuclear Systems Div.: “A forward looking space program such as that envisioned by the Task Group [see Sept. 15, 17] will mean growing reliance on nuclear systems. ... As an integral part of a new capability for space transportation, we look to the nuclear rocket to provide the propulsion to move large payloads from low earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit or to lunar orbit to support extended lunar exploration. It also offers major advantages for transporting heavy payloads into deep space.” nerva development was being initiated, with nuclear engine expected to be in operation in late 1970s. “It is also possible to envision ultimately the use of a controlled thermonuclear, or fusion, reaction for producing propulsion energy. Obviously development of such a propulsion system for space would come only after the development of a useful controlled thermonuclear reaction in a ground based plant, a goal that has not yet been achieved.” (Text)

October 11—18: U.S.S.R.’s Soyuz VI, carrying Cosmonauts Georgy S. Sho-nin and Valery N. Kubasov, was successfully launched from Baikonur at 4:10 pm Baikonur time into orbit with 229-km (142.3-mi) apogee, 194-km (120.6-mi) perigee, 88.8-min period, and 51.7° inclination. Tass said spacecraft carried equipment to test methods of welding materials in weightlessness and did not carry docking equipment used on Soyuz IV and Soyuz V Jan. 14—18. Western speculation, later confirmed, was that Soyuz VI would rendezvous with other spacecraft.
Soyuz VII, carrying Cosmonauts Anatoly V. Filipchenko, Vladislav N. Volkov, and Viktor V. Gorbatko, was launched from Baikonur at 3:45 pm Oct. 12 into orbit with 217-km (134.8-mi) apogee, 200-km (124.3-mi) perigee, 88.4-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Tass said spacecraft’s mission was “maneuvering in the orbit, staging joint navigation observations of the spaceships ... in group flight, observation of celestial bodies and the horizon of the Earth, determination of the real luminosity of stars, observation of changes in illumination created by the Sun and other scientific experiments.”
Third spacecraft, Soyuz VIII, carrying Cosmonauts Vladimir A. Shatalov and Dr. Aleksey S. Yeliseyev, was launched from Baikonur at 3:29 pm Oct. 13 into orbit with 278-km (172.7-mi) apogee, 215-km (133.6-mi) perigee, 89.4-min period, and 51.6° inclination. Its mission, Tass said, was “comprehensive simultaneous scientific studies in near-terrestrial space in accordance with an extensive program; testing of the complex system of controlling a simultaneous group flight of three space ships; mutual maneuvering of ships in orbit with the aim of solving a number of problems of developing the piloted space system.” TV viewers received announcement of flights about 30 min after launches and saw video-tape recordings of launches about U/2 hrs later. Ultimate goal of three-spacecraft mission was not given. In prelaunch interview shown on TV several hours after launch, Dr. Yeliseyev said group mission would conduct experiments leading to “creation of still more powerful orbiting stations.” Tass reported crews had checked out equipment and communicated with each other. Soyuz
VI	was conducting medical-biological tests, Soyuz VII was observing and photographing earth and celestial bodies, and Soyuz VIII was conducting research on polarization of solar light reflected by atmosphere.
On Oct. 14 Tass reported Soyuz VII and Soyuz VIII had moved close together, carried out “mutual observation-photography and movie filming,” studied “possibility of exchanging information with the aid of light signals and visceral optical methods,” conducted series of medical experiments, and observed “effect of erosion by micrometeorites on the condition of illuminators and optic systems of the craft.” On Oct. 15 spacecraft approached to within 500 yds during rendezvous, while Soyuz VI hovered nearby.
On Oct. 16 Radio Moscow announced Soyuz VI had successfully completed mission and had softlanded in preset area 100 mi northwest of Karaganda at 12:52 pm Moscow time. No information on other two Soyuz spacecraft was given until Tass announced softlanding of Soyuz
VII	at 12:36 pm Oct. 17 and of Soyuz VIII at 12:10 pm Oct. 18. Western officials speculated missions had not achieved all objectives. Tass said all major tasks were carried out with “high efficiency.” (Gwertzman, NYT, 10/12-14, 18/69; SBD, 10/14/69, 195; 10/ 21/69, 230; Reuters, W Post, 10/15-16/69; AP, W Star, 10/16/69, Al; Reston, LA Times, 10/19/69, A2; gsfc SSR, 10/15/69; 10/31/69)
October 11: Apollo 12 Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Richard F. Gordon, Jr., and Alan L. Bean held press conference at msc. Code names for Apollo 12 LM and cm had been selected, they said, from entries sub-
mitted by North American Rockwell Corp. and Grumman Aerospace Corp. employees. CM would be called “Yankee Clipper” and lm, “Intrepid.”
Major differences from Apollo 11 mission would be increase in geology and photography. Detailed documented sample collection would be team effort. Description would tell geologist about rock’s location, including how it was related to other rocks, whether it was partially covered, and why it attracted attention. Astronauts would carry bags and tongs at all times during eva to collect rocks when sighted instead of being limited to collecting during specific period of EVA.
Photographic activities, described by Conrad as “the world’s greatest zero-G juggling act,” would include multispectral photography of lunar surface, using four Hasselblad cameras in hatch window. Three cameras would have black-and-white film with filters; fourth would have infrared film. Purpose of camera setup, Gordon explained, was to “photograph the illuminated side of the moon from one minute after sunrise to one minute prior to sunset in a stiff manner.” Every 20 secs “cameras would be activated, to give complete strip photography across the surface of the moon. . . . The big step photography I think is probably one of the most important things we’re doing on this flight. . . .” (Transcript; msc Release 69—68)

•	Cambridge Univ. astronomer Fred Hoyle said in Science indications
that igneous lunar rocks were perhaps as old as meteorites might “lead to the suggestion that the moon experienced a period of intense volcanic activity early in its history.” There was no need for volcanoes to have occurred in situ on moon. “Considerations of angular momentum show that planetary material probably Separated from the sun when the radius of the latter was considerably greater than its present value. Current work on stellar structure requires that the effective surface temperature of the solar condensation be substantially constant at 3500° to 4000°K during this phase, independent of radius. Hence, for comparatively large radii the luminosity would have been very much greater than the present-day value, so that primitive planetary material could well have been considerably hotter than would be estimated for material at corresponding distances from the present-day sun. ... It will be of great interest to see if the recently acquired samples of lunar material establish the existence of such a hot phase, and, if so, to discover if any features of terrestrial geochemistry, which have hitherto been attributed to igneous activities on the earth itself, really belong to the initial primitive phase of the solar system.” (Science, 10/17/69, 401)

October 19: Boeing Co. President T. A. Wilson was quoted in Washington Post interview as saying 747 airliner was biggest financial gamble his firm had ever taken. Huge aircraft would compete with Lockheed 1011 and McDonnell Douglas DC—10, which were smaller but less expensive to purchase and operate, with three engines instead of four. While airlines were seeking ways to retrench, Boeing Co. was building 747 in plant bigger than vertical assembly building for Saturn V at ksc. To date, Boeing Co. had announced 183 orders for 747—not enough to recoup its expenses with aircraft price at $20 million each. McDonnell Douglas had orders for 97 DC—10s and options on 104 orders. Lockheed had 181 orders for 1011s. (Wilson, W Post, 10/19/69, B5)
•	John N. Wilford said in New York Times: “Even though the Soyuz flights
accomplished less than American observers had expected, they served notice that the Soviet Union may have forged ahead in space-station development while the United States was concentrating on the Apollo moon flight preparations.” But if U.S.S.R. had meant missions as beginning of first space station, “they fell far short.” There were “no link-ups of vehicles, no transfers of crews between ships and no test of the effects of long-duration weightlessness. None of the three ships was
placed in an orbit high enough for the prolonged flights being considered for space stations.”
Mission accomplishments could prove useful for construction of future space stations. “They proved that they were able to launch three manned spacecraft in three consecutive days, which the United States has not done. Such precision launchings are necessary for space station deployment.” Missions also had demonstrated first welding in space. “It will probably be necessary to weld together sections of a space station, rather than rely solely on the mechanical clamps used for present docking operations, and to make repairs by welding during flight.” (NYT, 10/19/69, E9)	..
October 20: Capt. Chester M. Lee (usn, Ret.), Apollo 12 Mission Director, described Apollo 12 plans to press at NASA Hq. [see Oct. 2]. Mission would be launched toward moon at 11:22 am est Nov. 14, carrying Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr. (commander), Alan L. Bean (lm pilot), and Richard F. Gordon, Jr. (cm pilot). Primary objectives would be to perform selenological inspection, survey and sample mare area, deploy Apollo lunar surface experiment package (alsep), develop techniques for point landing capability, and photograph candidate landing sites.
Basic flight plan would be similar to one for Apollo 11 (July 16—24) with modifications to improve landing accuracy and increase data return. Launch azimuth had been narrowed from 72°—108° for Apollo 11 to 72°—96° for Apollo 12 and trajectory had been changed from free-return to hybrid. Lunar orbit stay time for Apollo 12 would be increased from 59.6 hrs for Apollo 11 to 89 hrs; lunar surface stay time, from 21.6 hrs to 31.5 hrs; EVA from one 2-hr 32-min period to two 3-hr 30-min periods; and total mission time, from 195.3 hrs to 244.7 hrs. LM sleeping arrangements would be improved with hammocks, color TV if repaired by launch date would be used on surface, and LM ascent stage would be crashed onto lunar surface near seismometer after ascent from moon and redocking. To increase navigational accuracy crew would avoid waste and water dumps 10 hrs before landing to prevent thrust that might carry them off course, would approach moon upside-down so landing radar would be operational during entire landing phase, and would speed up descent to conserve fuel at landing.

•	Tass reported Soviet scientists had tested “electric jet plasma engine”
producing jet flow of gas that reached 75 mps. Engine “needs neither fuel nor oxidizer from the ground. Once the aircraft is taken to the ionosphere it is able to continue flying using only atmospheric nitrogen.” Tass said engine might be used to power “superfast” jetliners in upper atmosphere.
Washington Post quoted U.S. scientists as saying this was misinterpretation. No aircraft could fly high enough to take advantage of such an engine. Soviet development sounded like “very interesting” breakthrough, which U.S. was not even pursuing. It appeared to be new version of ion engine, which NASA would use aboard SERT spacecraft later in year. But SERT engine would carry its own fuel. Electrical power supply to convert nitrogen to electrified gas would be too heavy. (O’Toole, W Post, 10/21/69, A23)

•	Washington Evening Star editorial commented on Soyuz VI, VII,
and VIII: “The latest Soviet space spectacular, it would seem, adds up to a small step for mankind and a giant step for the welding trade. There is nothing overwhelmingly impressive about having three spacecraft in orbit at once. All that is required these days is the decision to get them up and the money to build three rockets and launch facilities. Even the highly touted welding experiment does not constitute a major technical breakthrough. It did raise the honorable trade to new heights, but the conditions under which the tests were made could have been— and probably have been—largely duplicated in the laboratory.” (W Star, 10/20/69)

October 20—23: aiaa’s Sixth Annual Meeting and Technical Display was held in Anaheim, Calif. Among 6,559 persons attending were Cosmonauts Georgy T. Beregovoy and Konstantin P. Feoktistov with Apollo 8 Astronaut Frank Borman, host for their U'.S. visit. At press conference Beregovoy said military use of space was not practical: “The aim of our program is the exploration of space. In our minds, space is the scene of peaceful work and investigation.” Feoktistov said U.S.— U.S.S.R. space race was “first phase of space flight.” Space research was now in second phase. “I think we can say that in that phase Soviet and American scientists are intensely helping each other.” LT.S.S.R. wanted to send unmanned spacecraft to moon’s vicinity, outer planets, and solar orbit and to develop weather and communications satellites. Soviet plans called for manned space stations and manned flights to vicinities of Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Asked when astronauts and cosmonauts might fly side by side, Beregovoy said, “We are going parallel but different ways now, but in principle such a possibility exists. Maybe a year, maybe three years. Maybe as soon as we learn English.” (aiaa Release 11/3/69; O’Toole, W Post, 10/24/69, A3) essa Administrator Robert M. White described new-generation
weather satellite itos that would be launched in prototype by NASA later in 1969 and in operational form by ESSA in early 1970. “It combines in one spacecraft both the stored-data and direct readout cameras of the present two-satellite [tiros] arrangement. Fewer launches will be required to keep the system in operation. The design allows for growth and the capacity to accommodate a variety of instruments to meet new and developing needs.” System would contain high-resolution infrared radiometer for “nighttime observations approaching daytime pictures in resolution and quality” thus providing 24-hr weather satellite coverage. “This step will enable us to meet fully the first national program objective—providing twice-daily observations of the entire earth, both by stored and direct readout systems, day and night.” (Text)
Fifty years of transatlantic flight—from usn NC—4 flying boat’s Lisbon arrival May 27, 1919, to June 3, 1969, maiden Atlantic crossing of Boeing 747—was traced in paper by Dr. Richard K. Smith, Ramsey Fellow at Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum. During “the Heroic Years on the North Atlantic between 27 May 1919 and 27 May 1939, there were 175 flights across the Atlantic; 142 were by airplanes, 33 by airships. ... It is confidently believed that all the persons who flew the Atlantic by airplane during that period could be accommodated aboard a 747, perhaps with some seats to spare. However, at least three more 747s would be required to lift those persons who flew by airship during 1919—1937!” (Text)
msc Flight Operations Director Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., said Apollo program might be extended to 1973 to allow NASA to fly three space station training missions in 1972. “It’s going to be some time before we settle it. But it’s going to be difficult to handle both Apollo and Apollo Applications from an operational point of view as well as a people point of view in 1972.” Revised launch schedule set Apollo 19 landing back to November 1972 and Apollo 20 to May 1973. Between Apollo 18 launch Feb. 11, 1972, and Apollo 19 were three orbital flights preparatory for establishment of first U.S. permanent space station in 1975. These flights could come just after Apollo 18, in May 1972 and in September 1972. Further reason for Apollo landings delay was possibility they would be made in remote lunar areas like crater Tycho, almost 1,000 mi below moon’s equator and rated among top-priority landing sites.

Dr. Arthur D. Code, Univ. of Wisconsin astronomer, reported discovery that relatively young stars in constellations Orion and Scorpius were generating heats of 45,000°F—5,000° hotter than had been thought. Finding, from data obtained by NASA’s Oao II satellite (launched Dec. 7, 1968), suggested young stars might be more massive and maturing faster than originally believed and supported theories of thermonuclear processes in stars’ interiors that generated such heats. Oao II data also showed younger stars had more complex chemical composition than stars formed near universe’s beginning. They contained fairly large amounts of carbon, silicon, magnesium, and heavier elements, as well as predominant hydrogen and helium. Other Oao II data indicated particles in interstellar space were variety of complex matter, much of which might be debris ejected from stars. (Wilford, NYT, 10/21/69, C19)
msc Director of Engineering Development Maxime A. Faget outlined concept of space vehicle with two reusable stages—booster rocket and orbiter craft—both with fixed wings, long fuselages, and rear rocket engines. Vehicle would be 225 ft high and weigh 2.5 million lbs at launch. Orbiter vehicle, capable of carrying 25,000 lbs of cargo and passengers, would be attached pickaback to booster stage’s upper half. Booster, burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, would elevate orbiter to fringe of space, separate, drop away, and cruise to landing like jet airliner. Booster probably would be piloted by two astronauts. Orbiter would ignite rocket engine to continue upward to space station orbiting at 300-mi altitude. After link-up with space station, transfer of cargo or 12 passengers, and pickup of new load, orbiter would be steered by pilot into atmosphere and controlled glide to landing on
10,000-ft runways used by aircraft. Key to reentry would be orbiter’s “angle of attack” when hitting atmosphere. Faget proposed 60° angle with nose up, so flattened bottom would catch airflow to slow descent. Small jet engines would be fired to help control final descent phases of both orbiter and booster. Outer surface of vehicles would be made of metal alloys that could sustain temperatures to 2,700°F. (Wilford, NYT, 10/24/69, 43)
Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., Secretary of the Air Force, discussed dod space activities: “In communications, meteorology and surveillance . . . we are actively pursuing increased capability. . . . Tactical communications using satellite relays are presently being intensely tested and show great promise in improving control of field units and increasing . . . cooperation between land, sea and air forces. In surveillance, our efforts have produced results. Of first importance is a new satellite early warning system that will do a great deal to further insure our ability to deter nuclear attack.” Savings in space travel costs “must be linked to the recovery and reuse of space vehicles. . . . Since major improvement in our ability to use space environment would be of direct assistance to both NASA and the military, we are jointly planning our research and development towards this objective.” (Text)

•	Press conference on preliminary science results of Biosatellite III
(launched June 28) was held at NASA Hq. Spacecraft, carrying male macaque monkey Bonny, had been launched on 30-day mission to investigate physiological problems during space flight but had been deorbited after 8% days when monkey’s condition deteriorated.
John W. Dyer, Manager of Biosatellite Project Operations at arc, said all of automatically controlled functions performed “beautifully” after launch and spacecraft and instrumentation performed well throughout mission. “The animal was reported to be enthusiastically eating and drinking, and after four or five days, a routine operation capable of going the duration of on-board consumables was projected.” Clear data on Bonny and entire flight system were recorded at 16 stations in 180 intervals of 5 to 10 min each and good quality data were returned from onboard tape and film records recovered with capsule.
Bonny remained alert until eighth day, providing much new information on cycles of sleep and wakefulness at zero g. Dr. W. Ross Adey of UCLA, principal experimenter, said one important discovery was alterations in circadian rhythms, daily rhythms in physiological functions. “At least it is clear that if there is not an actual prolongation of the rhythms there is a very significant phase shift so that the animal woke later and later each day.” Most interesting discovery about sleep patterns was that dream sleep, which constituted 20% of normal night’s sleep on earth and was characterized by rapid eye movements (rem), occurred in space. “It had never been clear in space whether man or animals have this REM sleep, and there is evidence that decreased gravitational inputs, or decreased inputs from the body will seriously disrupt it. So we were very interested to see that REM sleep in the monkey . . . that there was indeed a great deal of sleep of this rem type, and that it occurred in ... an intermediate stage of sleep.”
One of first abnormalities noted in Bonny was pendular eye movement, swinging movement that occurred when vestibular mechanism in inner ear was disturbed. Fluid was moving in some fashion that might indicate pressure or cooling if it occurred on earth. “None of these conditions applied here. But the weightlessness would allow movements of the fluid which were probably unusual. . . . This is interesting because the Apollo astronauts who have now much more room to move around than in . . . the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft have . . . almost uniformly reported some degree of vestibular disturbances.”
By eighth day, brain and body temperature and central venous pressure had dropped dangerously. Fluid loss by sweating and diuresis was high, apparently because of redistribution of blood in visceral pools from weightlessness. On recovery Bonny was semicomatose and his temperature was below 35°C. Immediate resuscitation measures with intravenous fluid were begun and monkey’s condition improved substantially. “The temperature came up to about 35.8, the heart rate stabilized, and the blood pressure came up. . . . And the animal was lifting his head . . . and making coordinated movements with all four limbs. And then quite suddenly, about twelve hours after recovery, a condition of ventricular fibrillation ensued. It came on very suddenly, and the heartbeat became totally disordered, And there was no recovery. This is a common occurrence in monkeys of this species when recovering from hypothermia . . . and death is almost a certainty.” Autopsy revealed 20% loss in body weight, much higher than 3%—8% reported for astronuats in early days of flights. Restraint, weightlessness, and decreased feedback from peripheral structures had decreased shivering response, and monkey had failed to respond to falling temperature with normal thermogenic response. Restraint and,
particularly, weightlessness had led to pooling of blood in thorax and abdomen, raising central venous pressures and leading to loss of fluid through kidney and sweating. Dr. Adey said mission was “highly successful in revealing physiological effects of weightlessness in spite of the reduced duration of the experiment” and indicated “great value of carefully designed animal experiments in collection of important biomedical data relevant to manned flight.”
Virtually every piece of information that could be drawn about manned space flight indicated similar changes in astronauts, though to smaller degree, he said. Scientists still did not know whether gravity was necessary for long-duration space flights. “Therefore, I think it is premature to consider the design of space platforms or the larger space stations until we know more from the biomedical point of view about what is absolutely necessary.” President’s Science Advisory Committee report to President Nixon, being printed, would say necessary biomedical basis for elaborate space platforms and space stations did not exist in NASA or in scientific community.

•	Retirement of Dr. Abe Silverstein, LeRC Director, was announced by Dr.
Thomas O. Paine, NASA Administrator. He would be succeeded Nov. 1 by OART Acting Administrator Bruce T. Lundin. In requesting retirement, Dr. Silverstein wrote: “As NASA engages in its second ten-year program, it may be important that the men whose decisions initiate the new long-range projects be available to complete them. Since I do not think I can stretch my 40 years of service into 50, it is perhaps best ... if I bow out now.” Few have made so great a contribution to our national space effort,” Dr. Paine said.
Dr. Silverstein had been first Director of Space Flight Programs in NASA Hq. in 1958. Under his leadership first U.S. man-in-space program, Project Mercury, had been planned and groundwork laid for Gemini and Apollo programs. He had joined NASA at Langley Aeronautical Laboratory in 1929 and helped design and later was in charge of Full-Scale Wind Tunnel. Transferring to Lewis Laboratory in 1943, he was responsible for conception, design, and construction of first U.S. supersonic-propulsion wind tunnels. After three years with NASA Hq., 1958—1961, he returned to LeRC as Director.
Lundin had served NASA since 1943, when he joined staff at Lewis. In 1961 he was appointed Associate Director for Development. In May 1968 he went to NASA Hq. as Deputy Associate Administrator for oart. (nasa Release 69—145; LeRC Release 69-61; LeRC Biog 4/67)

New insights into our complex environment will spur the development of new industries, new products and the new jobs which we need to gainfully employ our expanding population.” Air transportation would be one of first areas “dramatically affected” by space experience. “An inertial guidance system fundamentally the same as that which carried Apollo 11 to the moon is now being installed in the Boeing 747. Data concerning the flammability of nonmetallic materials, accumulated for use in the Apollo Modules, is being utilized for interior fittings. . . .” Other space-to-aviation transfers included composite materials to withstand stresses and temperatures not previously encountered, optical tooling for large structures, welding with new materials and by new processes in new aircraft, and general-purpose onboard digital computers. “The use of solid-state large-scale integrated circuits for multiplexing and self-checking circuits will eliminate most cabling and much maintenance.”
Desired characteristics of space shuttle, which could be operational by 1976, would anticipate those of next generation of air transports, possibly, global transport “so that no place on earth would be more than an hour from any other.” (Text)

October 25: Economist said of Soviet Soyuz “fiasco” U.S.S.R. had tried “highly ambitious link-up of the components of a permanent, orbiting space station, something the Americans will be in no shape to do for perhaps five years. The fact that the Russians apparently failed must have been humiliating to them, and gratifying to the Americans, but it is unlikely to be more than a temporary check to a programme that has rolled with considerable success since the Russians put the world’s first satellite in orbit more than a decade ago. The slow progress reflects the state of Soviet industry, but is steady progress with few loose ends. The American programme, trimmed and squeezed by political pressure and public opinion, is trailing appreciably more loose ends; despite the victory on the moon Nasa will have to set about tidying them up. And it is then that the Russians will have the last laugh.” (Economist, 10/25/69, 20)

•	Comsat issue had emerged as “classic case of governmental indecision—•
the result of divided federal responsibilities, complicated technical and legal issues, and powerful, competing industrial interests,” Robert J. Samuelson said in Washington Post article. Nearly year had passed since task force appointed Aug. 14, 1967, by President Johnson to formulate “national communications policy” had submitted report. Nixon Administration had begun separate investigation. Meanwhile, “supporters of a domestic system, frustrated by repeated delay, are pushing the White House and the fcc for a quick decision.” ComSatCorp had always been “ardent advocate.” In 1965 and 1966, nbc and ABC had “enthusiastically embraced” comsats as means of transmitting TV signals. Recently, CBS President Dr. Frank M. Stanton had become convert, “apparently provoked” by at&t’s new, higher TV signal rates.
Within month, White House might propose approval of domestic comsat system but fcc would still have difficult task of approving specific system. Only limited number of comsats could be orbited
24,000	mi above equator without interfering with each others’ transmission, even if Government were to allow more than one comsat system. If comsats assumed major role in communications, any decision allocating ownership rights could involve multimillions in eventual annual revenue. At first networks had asked to be allowed to create separate system, while ComSatCorp and at&t advocated single system. Unresolved issue helped explain “extended years of study.” However, recent changes made compromise more likely. (W Post, 10/26/69, FI)

On-orbit maintenance services can be provided for malfunctioning or inoperative satellites. . . . short duration special purpose orbital missions can be conducted by the space shuttle itself to augment or complement space station activities. The design and operational characteristics of the space shuttle will also provide a potential capability to conduct space rescue missions—a capability that is not practical with conventional expendable launch systems,” (Text)

The environment of a city whose life’s energy has been cut —whose transportation and communications are dead, in which medical and police help cannot be had, and where food spoils and people stifle or shiver while imprisoned in stalled subways or darkened skyscrapers-—all this also represents a dangerous environment that we must anticipate and work to avoid. ... I believe that the judicial development of nuclear power as a major source of energy for the future is in the public interest and that five, ten and a hundred years hence, men will look back with favor on the course we are taking today.” (Text)

Best use of manned lunar-landing capability in lunar exploration would entail shift of emphasis from technological development to exploitation of existing Apollo technology for scientific objectives. Board recommended: immediately focusing lunar program on optimizing returns on investment already made in Apollo through maximum use of existing Apollo technology; giving priority to current Apollo lunar-exploration phase should choice be necessary in early 1970s between funding major new manned exploration technology and funding extensions of Apollo lunar technology; periodic reevaluation of NASA’s proposed lunar landing sites; earliest possible extensions of Apollo technology to increase scientific returns and increasing interval up to six months between missions to allow incorporation of improvements; early provision of roving vehicle to transport astronauts at least 3.1—6.2 mi (5—10 km) from LM; inclusion in Apollo 16 to 20 time frame, in high-inclination orbit, of experiments in gravimetry by satellite-to-satellite tracking technique,
altimetry, magnetometry, x-ray and gamma-ray spectrometry, and medium- and high-resolution photography; and increase in supporting research in orbital sensing techniques, both active and passive.
Board also recommended high-priority consideration for long-distance, remotely controlled, traversing vehicle for later missions; careful review of Apollo program management structure to increase role of scientists in influencing basic policy and mission hardware; specific support to lunar experiment definition as integral part of Apollo program and more substantial investment in developing experiment packages easily modified and interchanged even shortly before flight; and high-priority attention to management, handling, distribution, and analysis of lunar samples brought to earth.

another prestige victory over the United States, and not the sort of worldwide humiliation they have endured with Luna 15 during the American moon landing, and then with the triple Soyuz anti-climax, they will have to pull something off soon. For if not the Soviet planners may see increasingly less reason to continue spending even 1 per cent of the country’s gross national product on its cosmonauts. . . . What is ironic is that a Soviet slowdown could be seen as a mirror image of the running battle in the United States between the scientists and the space engineers, but with the Russian scientists coming out on
top. The Academy of Sciences is widely regarded as the repository of all that is most stuffily conservative in Soviet science. That may have been the central cause of the Russian flop.” It was also blow to Americans who relied for new space funds on Nixon Administration’s “continuing fear of what the Russians may yet do.” (Economist, 11/8/69, 12-3)

•	NASA published A Long-Range Program in Space Astronomy: Position
Paper of the Astronomy Missions Board (nasa SP—213), which Board had submitted to NASA in July. Board of 19 leading U.S. astronomers— chaired by Dr. Leo Goldberg, Harvard College Observatory Director— had been appointed by NASA in autumn 1967 to consult scientific community and propose program for 1970s.
Astronomy had “far greater potential for advancement by the space program than any other branch of science.” Astronomical instruments in space could reach regions of electromagnetic spectrum unable to penetrate earth’s atmosphere; thus, “most fundamental problems of astronomy may be brought within range of solution.”
Board provided guidelines for minimum balanced program costing $250 million annually in 1970s and optimum program “proceeding at fastest possible rate consistent with available scientific and technical manpower” and costing $500 million annually during same period. Proposals included “careful assignment of priorities and balanced allocation of resources in order to optimize scientific progress on such problems as the origin of the universe; the course of stellar evolution, including the ultimate destiny of the Sun and solar system; the existence of other planetary systems, some of which may support other forms of intelligent life; and other problems with deep philosophical significance which are of great interest to everyone and are therefore properly supported by public expenditure.”
Board recommended increased effort in x-ray and gamma-ray astronomy using Explorer spacecraft with large payload capability; optical uv astronomy program leading to large space telescope in 1980s; r&d of detectors and small cooling systems for infrared astronomy from spacecraft to complement ground and aircraft observations;
observation of astrophysical objects in longwave radio portion of spectrum; more sophisticated solar spacecraft to extend observations of solar surface and study effects of solaf activity on earth; continued observations of planets from earth orbit using OAOs and Small Astronomy Satellite; more advanced observation of interplanetary medium, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields, with astronomy instrumentation on planetary and Explorer spacecraft; and augmented experiments using aircraft, balloons, and suborbital rocket launches.

It is another extremely important step in man’s exploration of earth’s natural satellite, a venture accompanied by great risk yet promising large rewards in additional knowledge. The mere fact that the Apollo 12 astronauts are scheduled to spend almost three times as long walking on the moon as their predecessors and to bring back to earth part of Surveyor 3—which landed in 1967—emphasizes how much more complex and ambitious this mission is.” Second moon landing might seem less glamorous than first, “but it requires great bravery and skill from all involved, and, if successful, could move lunar science ahead substantially.” (NYT, 11/9/69, 14)

November 10: The Biomedical Foundations of Manned Space Flight: A Report of the Space Science and Technology Panel of the President’s Science Advisory Committee was submitted to President’s Science Adviser, Dr. Lee A. DuBridge: “In order to define an appropriate mix of manned and unmanned operations, NASA will need to ‘qualify man for space flight’ in the broadest sense. That is, NASA should pursue a biomedical program which explores the optimization of man’s role in space, the limitations on his effectiveness and means to circumvent those limitations ... a program to determine the best use of man as a space subsystem in interaction with automated subsystems. An effective program directed to this objective exceeds the present capabilities of NASA and involves resources not yet developed in the biomedical community.”
Report criticized NASA for not implementing previous recommenda-
tions toward strong biomedical research capability. “Pressures for early and reasonably certain success led to placing primary emphasis initially on validation of the capability to construct, orbit, and recover manned spacecraft, with long-range, scientific goals in the biomedical field set aside as potentially interfering with flight objectives. Scientific requirements were thus deemphasized at the very time when development of basic scientific knowledge and a cadre of scientific talent should have been begun.” NASA was now faced “with the question of qualifying man for more complex tasks in space, for longer duration flights, and of evaluating man as an integral part of the spacecraft man-machine system, without sound biomedical foundation.” In particular, “decisions concerning development directions for the next generation of manned spacecraft systems for use in earth orbit must be made without an adequate basis of understanding.”
NASA should plan overall biomedical program using resources, personnel, and experience of other Government areas, especially dod, and support multidisciplinary environmental medical laboratories within universities. Report favored international cooperation in space exploration for peaceful purposes, close communications with biomedical community, and broadened participation of biomedical scientists in space flight programs. NASA should affiliate biologically and medically trained astronauts with research components of NASA or qualified institutions. They should be assigned to msc flight-crew organization only when participating in specific missions. Report recommended that NASA consider separating space biomedical research from organization conducting space missions and from flight medical services. (Text)

•	Aircraft collision was “one of the most important specific difficulties
facing the continuing expansion of aeronautical services in the United States,” NASA oart said in prepared statement for National Transportation Safety Board [see Nov. 14]. Continuing increase in air passenger and cargo transportation and number of general-aviation aircraft would further increase collision risk. Advent of jumbo jet and sst would increase number of fatalities and value of equipment lost in individual collisions. Best long-term solution was “development of an adequate traffic control system, adequate airports, and adequate airspace utilization techniques.” Until achieved, other means for preventing collisions must be developed for commercial and general-aviation aircraft.

November 14—24: Apollo 12 (AS—507), second manned lunar landing mission, was successfully flown by NASA. Spacecraft’s LM—6, Intrepid, made pinpoint landing Nov. 19 on lunar surface near Surveyor III, which had landed April 19, 1967. Two astronauts deployed experiments, took photos, and collected samples in two eva periods on moon before lifting off to dock with orbiting CSM—108, Yankee Clipper, and return safely to earth.
November 14—18: Spacecraft carrying Astronauts Charles (Pete) Conrad, Jr. (commander), Richard F. Gordon, Jr. (cm pilot); and Alan L. Bean (lm pilot) was launched from ksc Launch Complex 39, Pad A, by Saturn V booster at 11:22 am est Nov. 14. Launch was watched by 3,000 invited guests, including President and Mrs. Nixon. Weather conditions at launch were minimal: peak ground winds of 14 knots, light rain showers, broken clouds at 800 ft, and overcast at
November 14: President Nixon and his daughter Tricia {foreground) watched preparations jor the launch of Apollo 12 from ksc, while Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA A rimin' istrator, shielded Mrs. Nixon from rain. Seconds into flight an electrical discharge shut down the spacecraft fuel cells, but the astronauts corrected the condition.
10,000	ft with tops at 21,000 ft. During ascent observers on ground saw two parallel streaks of lightning flash between clouds and launch pad. NASA reported electrical transients, later attributed to electrical potential discharges from clouds through spacecraft to ground, had suddenly shut off spacecraft’s electrical power at 00:36 get and turned on numerous alarms in cm. Spacecraft automatically switched to backup battery power while crew restored primary power system.
Commander Conrad radioed, “We had everything in the world drop out.” Control Center commented, “We’ve had a couple of cardiac arrests down here, too.” “There wasn’t time up here,” Conrad answered.
Power system remained normal throughout rest of mission. Spacecraft entered planned parking orbit with 118-mi (189.9-kra) apogee and 115.0-mi (185.0-km) perigee.
After postlaunch checkout CSM. separated from Saturn V 3rd stage (S-IVB) and LM, code-named Intrepid, Onboard TV initiated after separation clearly showed csm transposing and docking with lm at 3:27 GET and ice on windows from rain frozen during liftoff. Crew ejected CSm/lm from S—IYB and conducted first SPS burn for translunar insertion. Slingshot maneuver placed S—IVB into earth orbit with
515,549.4-	to 560,429.9-mi {829,519.0- to 901,731.7-km) apogee and
93,213.2-	to 109,324.1-mi (149,980.0- to 175,902.5-km) perigee and period of 39 to 45 days, instead of heliocentric orbit planned, because of error in instrument unit. To ensure that electrical transients during launch had not affected lm systems, Conrad and Bean entered LM at 7:20 GET for housekeeping and systems checks. All checks indicated systems were satisfactory, Translunar insertion maneuver was so accurate that midcourse maneuver No. 1 was not necessary. Midcourse correction No. 2, at 30:53 GET, placed spacecraft on desired hybrid circumlunar trajectory with closest approach of 69.1 mi; third and fourth maneuvers were not necessary. Good-quality TV coverage of preparations for and performance of midcourse maneuver was transmitted for 47 min.
Conrad and Bean began transfer to LM during translunar coast Y2 hr earlier than planned to obtain full TV coverage through Goldstone tracking station. The 56-min transmission, beginning at 62:52 get, showed excellent color pictures of GSM, intravehicular transfer, LM interior, earth, and moon. Gordon reported crew was in good condition. TV broadcast scheduled for 81:30 GET before lunar orbit insertion was canceled because of sun angle and glare on spacecraft windows.
November 18-21: Apollo 12 csm and LM separated in lunar orbit and ike LM Intrepid made a pinpoint landing on the moon Nov. 19, 600 feel away from Surveyor III, which had landed April 19, 1967. Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr^ and Alan L. Bean deployed experiments, took photos, and collected samples in two eva periods. At left Conrad, photographed by Bean, examined Surveyor III in the Ocean of Storms, with Intrepid on the horizon. Above, a crewman used hand tools from a tool carrier.
Spacecraft entered lunar orbit with 194.3-mi (312.6-km) apolune and 72.0-mi (115.9-km) perilune at 83:25 GET (10:47 pm est Nov. 17) after first sps burn. During first lunar orbit good quality TV coverage of lunar surface was transmitted for 33 min. Crew provided excellent descriptions of lunar features. Second SPS burn circularized orbit with 76.1-mi (122.5-km) apolune and 62.5-mi (100.6-km) perilune at 87:47 get. Conrad and Bean transferred to lm for l^g-hr housekeeping, voice and telemetry test, and oxygen-purge-system check and then returned to CM.
November 18—21: Conrad and Bean reentered lm and checked out all systems before firing reaction-control-system thrusters at 107:54 get to separate CSM and LM. Descent-propulsion-system engine propelled LM to position 4.6—5.8 mi north of expected ground track and error was corrected during powered descent maneuver, lm guidance computer was updated during powered descent to compensate for indications that trajectory was 4,200 ft short of target point. At entry into approach phase trajectory was close to nominal. Crew took over manual control at 370 ft, passed over right side of target crater, and flew to left for landing on moon’s Ocean of Storms about 600 ft from Surveyor 111 spacecraft at 111:32 get (1:55 am est Nov. 19). Landing coordinates were approximately 3.036° S and 23.418° W. Conrad reported extensive dust obscuring view during final descent. After landing he reported sighting cms orbiting overhead. Gordon, orbiting moon in
CM Yankee Clipper, reported sighting Surveyor III and Intrepid on moon.
Conrad opened lm hatch at 115:11 GET, descended LM ladder, and deployed modularized equipment stowage assembly (mesa) containing camera which recorded his descent to lunar surface. Conrad reported seeing Surveyor HI spacecraft and said lm had landed 25 ft down-range from lip of crater. Conrad, inches shorter than Neil A. Armstrong, who had stepped onto moon July 21, had difficulty taking last step from ladder. When he touched lunar surface at 115.22 get (6:44 am est Nov. 19) Conrad said, “Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small step for Neil, but that’s a long one for me.” He said lunar surface was soft and loosely packed, causing his boots to dig in as he walked, and sun was bright like a spotlight, lm had landed so gently its shock-absorbing legs were barely telescoped by gentle impact.
Conrad recorded Bean’s descent to lunar surface at 115:52 get (7:14 am EST Nov. 19). Shortly after color TV camera was removed from mesa bracket, transmission was lost and was not regained for remainder of eva. Crew collected 40- to 50-lb contingency sample and reported mounds resembling volcanoes. Mounds were 4 ft high with flattened tops 5 ft wide and sides sloping out to 15- to 20-ft dia. Conrad said he saw neither breccia nor vesicular rocks, only basalts. Lithium hydroxide canisters and contingency sample were transferred to lm ; S-band antenna, solar wind composition experiment, and American flag were deployed as planned, alsep with SNAP—27 atomic generator was deployed 600—700 ft from lm. Shortly after deployment passive seismometer transmitted to earth signals from astronauts’ footsteps as they returned to lm. During deployment astronauts kicked up dust and some adhered to instruments. Overall effect would be determined through long-term measurements of system’s engineering parameters. Conrad and Bean dusted each other off and entered Intrepid after 3 hrs 56 min walking on lunar surface.
After resting inside lm and checking plans for second eva period, astronauts left lm at 131:33 get (10:55 pm est Nov. 19), 1 hr 40 min ahead of schedule. Astronauts stored lm TV camera in equipment transfer bag for return to earth for failure analysis. Conrad walked to alsep site to check leveling of lunar atmosphere detector. Astronaut movement on surface was recorded on passive seismometer and lunar surface magnetometer, eva traverse took crew to alsep deployment site, Head Crater, Bench Crater, Sharp Crater, Halo Crater, Surveyor III site, Block Crater, and back to lm. Astronauts walked 1,500—2,000 ft from lm, covering about 6,000-ft distance, their confidence and speed increasing with experience. After walk Conrad reported he had fallen once but Bean had picked him up without difficulty. Conrad rolled grapefruit-sized rock down wall of Head Crater about 300—400 ft from passive seismometer, but no significant response was detected.
Crew obtained desired photographic panoramas, core samples, trench sample, lunar environment sample, and assorted rock, dirt, bedrock, and molten samples. They reported fine dust buildup on all sides of larger rocks and said soil color lightened as depth increased. Crew reported Surveyor footpad marks were still visible and entire spacecraft looked brown, as if something had rained on it. Glass parts were not
broken. Crew retrieved parts of Surveyor III, including TV camera and soil scoop. They then retrieved solar wind composition experiment and stowed it in equipment bag, took stereo pictures near lm, and transferred all collected samples, parts, and equipment to lm. They dusted off, reentered LM, and jettisoned equipment according to plan, closing hatch by 134:82,get (2:44 am EST Nov. 20), after 3 hrs 49 min walking on lunar surface in second eva period.
While lm was on moon Gordon, orbiting moon in csm, completed lunar multispectral photography experiment and photographed Wall of Theophilus and future landing sites, Fra Mauro and Descartes. Film would be analyzed to aid scientists in planning for future sample collection and in extrapolating known compositions from returned samples to parts of moon that would not be visited.
At 142:04 get (9:26 am est Nov. 20) lm successfully lifted off moon after 31 hrs 31 min on lunar surface, leaving lm descent stage. Astronauts brought back 95 lbs of lunar surface samples, parts of Surveyor III, films, and miniature flags of 136 nations, 50 U.S. states, and 4 U.S. possessions. A 1.2-sec overburn of lm ascent propulsion system caused by incorrect manual switching sequence prevented automatic shutdown of engine and resulted in insertion velocity 32 fps greater than planned, placing lm in orbit with 71.4-mi (114.9-km) apolune and 10.6-mi (17.1-km) perilune. Crew quickly recognized discrepancy, manually shut down engine, and used RSC trim maneuver to enter planned orbit with 53.3-mi (85.8-km) apolune and 10.1-mi (16.3-km) perilune.
Rendezvous maneuvers occurred as planned and lm docked with csm at 145:36 get (12:58 pm est Nov. 20). TV was transmitted from csm for last 24 min of rendezvous sequence. Crew transferred with samples, equipment, and film to CSM; lm ascent stage was jettisoned and intentionally crashed onto lunar surface at 5:17 pm est Nov. 20 about 44.9 mi (72.2 km) southeast of Surveyor III. Crash was detected by seismometer left on moon and produced reverberations lasting for more than 30 min. Crew made csm plane-change maneuver at 159:05 GET and took high-resolution and stereo-strip photos and tracked landmarks, to conclude planned photography of Fra Mauro, Descartes, and Lalande.
November 21—24: Crew fired SPS engine at 172:27 get (3:49 pm est Nov. 21), injecting csm into transearth trajectory after 89 hrs 2 min (44 revolutions) in lunar orbit. Midcourse correction No. 5, at 188:28 get, was so accurate that sixth correction was not necessary. TV transmission of receding moon and spacecraft interior was transmitted for 38 min, beginning at 192:27 get. Good-quality transmission of question-and-answer period with scientists and press was conducted for 37 min, beginning at 224:07 get. Final midcourse correction— No. 7 at 241:24 get—resulted in predicted entry velocity of 36,116 fps and flight path angle of —6.47°. CM Yankee Clipper separated from SM at 244:07 get. Parachute deployment and other reentry events occurred as planned. Yankee Clipper splashed down in mid-Pacific at 244:36 get (3:58 pm est Nov. 24), 4.03 mi from recovery ship U.S.S. Hornet. Astronauts, wearing flight suits and masks, were carried by helicopter from CM to recovery ship, where they entered mobile quar-
antine facility (mqf) with recovery physician and technician. Crew, physician, and technician remained inside mqf until it was delivered to Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston.
cm was retrieved and mated to MQF transfer tunnel on board recovery ship. From inside MQF/cm containment envelope, MQF engineer removed lunar samples and equipment through decontamination lock and cm was sealed until delivery to LRL. Sample return containers, film, and other data were flown to Pago Pago and to Houston for transport to LRL.
Primary Apollo 12 mission objectives—to perform selenological inspection, survey, and sampling of mare area, deploy and activate ALSEP, develop techniques for point landing capability, develop man’s capability to work in lunar environment, and obtain photos of candidate exploration sites—were achieved. All launch vehicle and spacecraft systems performed according to plan, with only minor and corrected discrepancies. Flight crew performance was outstanding. All three crew members remained in excellent health and good spirits. Accomplishments included first use of hybrid trajectory, largest U.S. payload placed into lunar orbit (72,335 ibs after lunar orbit insertion), first demonstration of point landing capability, first use of two EVA periods, first recharge of portable life-support system, first double-core-tube sample, first return of samples from vehicle previously landed on moon, longest distance traversed on lunar surface, first multispectral photography from lunar orbit, and longest lunar mission to date.
Apollo 12 was ninth Apollo mission to date, sixth manned Apollo mission, and second manned lunar landing mission. Apollo 11 (July 16—24, 1969) had proved capability to perform manned landing on moon and return and to retrieve lunar samples for study on earth. Apollo program was directed by NASA Office of Manned Space Flight; msc was responsible for Apollo spacecraft development, msfc for Saturn V launch vehicle, and ksc for launch operations. Tracking and data acquisition was managed by gsfc under overall direction of NASA Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition, (nasa Proj Off; Mission Commentary; NASA Release 69—148; FonF; NYT, 11/15—26/69; W Post, 11/15-26/69; W Star, 11/15-26/69; B Sun, 11/15-26/69) November 14: President Nixon became first President to witness space launch while in office when he, Mrs. Nixon, and daughter Tricia viewed Apollo 12 launch at ksc. President called liftoff “spectacular.” Later he addressed NASA personnel in Launch Control: “. . . I know there has been a lot of discussion as to what the future of the space program is. ... I do think you can be assured that in Dr. Paine and his colleagues you have men who are dedicated to this program, who are making the case for it ... as against other national priorities and making it very effectively. I leaned in the direction of the program before. After hearing what they have had to say with re'gard to our future plans, I must say that I lean even more in that direction. ... I realize that in those within the program . . . there are different attitudes as to what the emphasis should be, whether we should emphasize more exploration or more in taking the knowledge we have already acquired and making practical applications of it. . . . We want to have a balanced program, but most important, we are going forward. America ... is first in space.” (Carroll, B Sun, 11/15/69, Al; PD, 11/17/69, 1601-2)

He felt there were more tourists at Cape Kennedy this week than in July bcause “fewer were scared by press reports . . . that all facilities would be jammed.” Many were seeing launch for first time “and it is still a thoroughly thrilling experience.” (Blakeslee, NYT, 11/14/69, 33)
•	Liverworts grown in lunar soil at LRL had reached three-inch height and
were “green and happy,” Washington Post said, while controls, grown in earth soil, were “puny—not even an inch high—and pale.” Difference in plants, commonly found on rocks and in forests and among first to grow in volcanic areas, had been considered small when first noted in August. However, LRL Chief of Preventive Medicine, Dr. William Kemmerer, now called difference “one of the really unexpected results of the lunar mission.” Plant tests had been conducted to see if lunar material caused harm to earth plants. Control plants had been grown in desert soil. Tobacco cells and soy bean cells in culture with lunar soil had done better than controls in earth soil; ferns were growing “more spectacularly” than some grown in earth soil. Man’s knowledge of trace mineral requirements in plants and animals was “very, very limited,” Dr. Kemmerer had said. “I don’t think we’ll find something going on in lunar nutrition that we don’t find on the earth, I do think important questions have been raised.” (Cohn, W Post, 11/14/69)

•	Washington Post editorial on Apollo 12 launch: “Through the peculi-
arities of our time, we are all about to become participants, albeit vicariously, in the kind of research and exploration that has been carried out previously by lonely scientists almost in isolation. Radio and television make it possible for us to watch and to hear two explorers as they go about the somewhat mundane business of making and recording observations, picking up rocks, and setting up equipment. As these flights roll on through the next few years, we will watch the slow process of exploration proceed. In a way, it will be like being there when Darwin traveled around the world and made the observations that resulted in his theory of evolution or when Lewis and Clark explored the Northwest. Not too much should be expected from any one trip or any one set of experiments. It is the totality of knowledge, not its fragments, that counts.” (W Post, 11/15/69, A20)

In Communicating by Satellite: An International Discussion, task force appointed to consider new rules and regulations for international satellite communications said: “Obstacles undoubtedly exist to achieving the goal of an integrated, global system, but technical compatibility between the two major satellite communications systems—Intelsat and Intersputnik (through the Soviet Orbita)—is not difficult to obtain. Their orbital systems are complementary; their frequency plans can be coordinated; a single ground station can operate in either system, and their transmitting and receiving equipment can be adapted for operation in both systems.”
All nations should have access to global, integrated comsat system with “willingness and ability to accept certain technical and administrative requirements” only relevant consideration. No political conditions should be applied to membership. Voting rules should “take account of the special contributions” of countries like U.S. and U.S.S.R. “while recognizing the interests of virtually all nations in the basic rules of operation of the system.” No nation should be allowed to broadcast sound and TV into territory of other nations without their consent.

pollution, NASC Executive Secretary William A. Anders, former Apollo 8 astronaut, said in speech before Governors’ Conference on California’s Changing Environment in Los Angeles. With remote sensors in aircraft “pilot can quickly and accurately map pollution levels over a wide area and range of altitudes.” Pollution map of entire U.S. could be generated each day. “Thus, aircraft and satellites with these remote sensors offer the unique advantage of being able to view large areas through new eyeballs very quickly and selectively. Further, by computer, the data can be reduced to formats that can be quickly and easily understood.” Aircraft and satellite surveys would provide “data which supplement surface techniques and which, in some cases, can’t be gathered in any other way.” Rather than fantastically expensive, satellite measurements could “be competitive with surface systems.” (Text)
•	Soviet space program had been severely set back by “catastrophic explo-

U.S.S.R.’s manned orbiting platform (mop) program, “already at least a year behind schedule and proceeding slowly, has been further retarded because of the . . . failure. Last month’s triple Soyuz launch has emerged as a prime example of rescheduling necessitated by the booster’s absence and by the aftermath of shortterm and conflicting political decisions. . . .
“Failure of the booster prototype was only one event in a largely chaotic year for the Soviet space program. During 1969 the Russians: shifted much of their large booster inventory to military purposes in connection with the Chinese border crisis”; postponed scheduled late spring launch of Soyuz VI “because all remaining non-military facilities were in turn preempted by a highly compressed lunar effort”; and hastily launched Luna XV “in an effort to prove, in event of an Apollo failure, that at least a one-way soft landing from lunar orbit could be performed unmanned and, alternately, that failure would not result in loss of human life.” (Av Wk, 11/17/69, 26—7)

seat-mile of matching the 440-seat economy version of the 747.” (Text)

•	NASA Launch Vehicle Review Board recommended resumption of launch
operations for spacecraft using Delta booster. In interim report board said recommendation was based on findings of Failure Review Board which had investigated failures of Delta 71 (July 25) and Delta 73 (Aug. 27). Delta 71, carrying Intelsat-111 F—5, had failed because of motor case rupture or nozzle failure; Delta 73, carrying Pioneer E, had failed because of vibrating relief valve which caused hydraulic oil leak. Failure Review Board suggested additional internal insulation, pressure tests, equipment x-rays, installation of specially tested and selected valves, and new acceptance tests of hydraulic system.

November 20: U.S. newspaper editorials commented on Apollo 12 landing on moon:
Washington Post: “The sheer joy of these two astronauts . . . shines out over everything else. They are obviously moon-struck. Conrad sounded like the most eager and happiest young geology student in the universe as he hummed and laughed his way from rock to rock, grabbing one after the other and complaining that he couldn’t get enough. And who would have thought that one of these highly skilled men would resort, as Bean did, to bonking the television camera with a hammer in an effort to make it work? Unfortunately, the failure of the camera did deprive us of seeing this frolic. . . . There was much to be learned from it about the moon and about the men who combine such cool technical competence with such zest for a serious and dangerous job.” (W Post, 11/20/69)
Detroit News: “To travel 230,000 miles and hit the target on the button is almost unbelievable except that NASA, its crews and its machines are making believers of us all. But there’s a lesson to be taken to heart in the camera’s freak failure. Conrad and Bean tried to remedy the defect. . . . But they had to drop that to get on with more essential scientific exploratory experiments. Conrad’s oxygen limit was four hours. He hadn’t time to spare. . . . that should be warning to those euphoric advocates of setting a target date for a trip to Mars. An astronaut limited to four hours work on the moon is a reminder of the vast project ahead in confounding the elements in this untapped lunar mystery. Prophecies of colonizing the moon should be set against that four-hour limit, even though we no doubt will improve on it.” (D News, 11/20/69)
Atlanta Constitution: “This second landing, more than 900 miles from where the pioneers of Apollo 11 put down last July, notably extends our knowledge. New landing techniques, a longer lunar stay, nuclear-powered experiments—they all serve to push back a fantastic
frontier which only a few short years ago was regarded as a most implausible province of man.” (Atlanta Constitution, 11/20/69)
Houstin Chronicle: “Our admiration for the coolness and the skill of astronauts Conrad, Bean and Richard F. Gordon, Jr.—the latter still in lonely orbit around the Moon—is boundless. The astronauts continue to perform, one mission after the other, in story-book perfection. We marvel, too, at the ability of the technicians on the ground to quickly respond to unexpected eventualities, like the electrical difficulty just after the launch, and to enable the mission to proceed unimpaired. These achievements inspire all men. They lift our sights for the future.” (.H Chron, 11/20/69, 2 Sec, 5)
Birmingham, News: “The flight has been so predictably on schedule that its very success is certain to help push moon travel back into the ho-hum recesses of blase mankind’s mind, as each success in the Mercury and Gemini and early Apollo series made earth orbital spaceflight seem routine.” (B News, 11/20/69)

•	Total $21.35-billion investment “in the development and demonstration
of a national manned lunar landing capability” was detailed by Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, in letter to Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D-N. Mex.), Chairman of Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. “At the time of its establishment, the national goal of a manned lunar landing and return in this decade represented the most difficult technological endeavor ever to challenge the American nation. During this period, senior NASA officials in testimony before the Congress estimated the cost ... at between $20 and $40 billion.” Estimate was refined to approximately $19.5 billion in March 1964, with assumption “there would be a timely initiation of a follow-on program which would bear a portion of the relatively fixed cost required to develop and sustain this national capability.” Estimates then and annual reassessments had reflected total program cost, including cost of initial lunar landing. Lunar objective “was not simply an end in itself but, rather, provided the focus for the effort to attain space supremacy for whatever the national interest required.” In March 1966 NASA had furnished estimate of $22,718 billion based on assumption that there would not be timely initiation of follow-on program. In April 1969 NASA furnished estimate of $23,877 billion, which would still be valid if negative assumption had materialized. “But with the success of Apollo 11, we have the opportunity to utilize this demonstrated capability in a more meaningful way. By improving payloads and modifying spacecraft to increase lunar surface systems, we can enhance significantly the return of scientific data from both lunar orbit and the lunar surface.”
NASA had met national commitment “at a cost nearer the lower end of the range of estimates” despite “unpredictable substantial inflationary conditions.” Actual cost accrued through July 31, 1969, was $21.35 billion, of which $2 billion was value of flight hardware available for future flights. Capital assets included were approximately $2.8 billion and were “of continuing national value.”
Apollo was “triumph in management as well as in technology and engineering which united government, industry and universities in a common peaceful undertaking. At least one-half million people worked on the manned lunar landing program . . . during the eight years from its announcement to its initial success.” (Text)

Gordon, Jr., had both received promotions to commander, usn. Apollo 12 LM Pilot Alan L. Bean, also commander, USN, now rated promotion to captain, but was junior crewman in age, service in grade, and space experience. Bean promotion might “irritate” others but would be fair to Bean.

astronauts begin to do tours of duty that could run from three months to a year at a time on the moon, or on orbiting earth platforms— still more when they embark on 2% year trips to Mars—the problems will be much greater. Their bodies may adapt themselves to conditions of weightlessness or low gravity, and to living in atmospheres of rather less density than on earth, and then find it hard to re-adapt back to earth conditions again. If, over time, the changes become irreversible, we could witness the evolution of a new race of space hominoids with whom we could communicate but not cohabit.” (Economist, 11/22/69)

Intrepid, on the contrary, landed within a few hundred feet of Surveyor 3, the prime target of its crew’s planned collection activities. It will take months, perhaps years, to harvest the full scientific gains from Apollo 12.

December 9: LeRC Director Bruce T. Lundin discussed future interest in transonic speed range—mach 0.7 to mach 1.4—before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology during hearings on U.S. aeronautical activities: “Cruise speeds of commercial and military transports have already reached about Mach 0.85, and further increases to about Mach
1.15 are of interest because this speed can be attained without sonic boom effects. The transonic speed range is also critical for a supersonic transport because performance in this range determines subsonic cruise efficiency. Transonic speed characteristics are important to fighter aircraft because they are required to maneuver at these speeds, and they are important to bomber aircraft because they affect the engine size which is necessary to accelerate to higher supersonic speeds. ... It is in this speed range that many interactions, shock waves, and flow separations occur that become important to the thrust, drag, and stall margin of the engine and on the lift, drag and buffet characteristics of the aircraft. Unfortunately, mathematical prediction techniques do not work well in this speed range and experimental testing becomes of major importance.” Only very small models could be used in transonic tunnels “and scaling up results from very small models to full size airplanes is at best difficult and usually impossible. We will be paced here for some time to come by the capabilities of our experimental facilities.” (Testimony)

•	End of era in satellite watching would come with discontinuation in June
1970 of Smithsonian Institution’s optical tracking program, John Lannan said in Washington Evening Star. NASA already was terminating 10-yr support of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s efforts at Cambridge, Mass. Optical tracking had cost $4 million annually since 1958, first through nsf, then NASA. Program had led to nationwide “Dial-A-Satellite” telephone net by which tape-recorded messages told callers where satellites could be seen in sky. Service had become “Dial-A-Phenomenon” to note ecological, geophysical, and astronomical events, since decay of only visible satellites, Echo 1 and Echo II. Smithsonian Observatory had watched satellites with worldwide battery of Baker-Nunn cameras, which had been phased out except for observing maneuvers in major space flights. Observatory’s geodetic program was being expanded, with two lasers operational, one on Mount -Hopkins, Ariz., the other in Athens, Greece, but financial support had been halved for current fiscal year and would be cut to $1.3 million in 1971.

• Apollo 12 Astronauts Charles Conrad, Jr., Richard F. Gordon, Jr., and
Alan L. Bean held press conference at msc and showed movies and slides of mission. Explaining failure of color TV camera, Conrad said: “What apparently happened ... is that I took the thing off mesa and set it down. The MESA was in the sun at the time and ... I apparently either pointed it at the sun or pointed it at the mesa, which was in the sun and a pretty bright reflector . . . and just that few seconds . . . was
enough to sunburn the camera. ... I didn’t realize it was as sensitive to light as it is.”
Dust on surface was a major problem, Conrad said. Ground was soft and astronauts sank in significantly. It was difficult to keep experiment package clean. “It was almost impossible for us to walk around those packages without our little dust cloud and at any time the dust hit the surface of the package it stuck and the worst thing you could do was try to rub it off because you just smeared it over them even worse. . . .”
To question about difficulty in landing LM on moon, Conrad replied he had misinterpreted correct gage reading and underestimated accuracy of LM’s descent. “. . . I felt that that gage was not . . . giving me the proper information. I found it quite hard to believe that I could have gotten the velocity killed quite as well as I did . . . and so I was continually going out the window to get roll information and a general idea of my lateral and horizontal velocities.” Although Conrad felt landing on moon was not “an amateur’s game,” he felt satisfactory landings under completely instrumented flight rule conditions could be made. Crew had suggested adding instrument that would provide automatic nulling of horizontal and lateral velocities but would leave pilot with rate of descent command. Conrad said he did not think dust during descent would be problem on future missions “as long as you get a look at your landing site before you get into the dust, and ascertain that it’s all right—it’s perfectly all right to go in and land, IFR. ... I don’t recommend any change from the procedures that we’re using right now.”
Bean said photos of moon were realistic, but photos of earth were not. “As we view the Moon from the Earth, it’s white and flat; it’s quite pretty. When you get up at the Moon . . . it’s much the same; it’s either white or concrete colored or grey. . . . But when you look at the Earth ... it kind of sparkles, and . . . you can’t capture it on the film. It’s sort of like taking a picture of an emerald . . . and hoping to get it.”
Gordon said he had mixture of emotions, “a mixture of thoughts, as to why is it all here? And . . . what the function that each person, each part, each molecule, each body performs, in the overall scheme of why is it, what is it, and from where did it come.” (Transcript)
• Lunar Receiving Laboratory scientists told press at msc rocks retrieved from moon by Apollo 12 crew were younger, lower in titanium, and higher in nickel than those retrieved by Apollo 11 and showed no signs of bacteria or toxicity. Dr. Oliver A. Schaeffer of New York State Univ. at Stony Brook said Apollo 12 samples seemed to be 2.2 billion to 2.5 billion yrs old, compared to 3.8 billion to 4.6 billion yrs old for Apollo 11 samples. “The younger age means the . . . activity, whether volcanic or meteorite impact, took place over an extended period of time, not on a short time scale.”
Dr. S. Ross Taylor of Australian National Univ. said chemistry of Apollo 12 and Apollo 11 samples was basically similar but had many interesting differences. “The surface is not completely homogeneous across the moon. There are differences in chemistry probably reflecting in the underlying rock. ... it looks as though we could have two extremes of differences.” Apollo 12 samples from Ocean of Storms had about half titanium content found in Apollo 11 samples from Sea of
Tranquility. They had few refractory elements and fewer volatile elements. (Wilford, NYT, 12/13/69, 20; Cohn, W Post, 12/13/69, A10)

For atmosphere consisting predominantly of carbon dioxide, surface pressures between 6 and 7 millibars at three points of measurement and 3.8 at fourth, indicated elevation of 3.1—3.7 mi (5—6 km). Temperature profile measured by Mariner VI near equator in daytime indicated temperatures in stratosphere about 100°K warmer than those predicted by theory. Measurements by Mariner VI taken at 79°N at beginning of polar night indicated conditions were favorable for condensation of carbon dioxide at almost all altitudes. Mariner VII measurements taken at 58°S in daytime and 38°N at night also showed carbon dioxide condensation was possible at altitudes above about 15.5 mi (25 km). Measurements of electron density in ionosphere showed upper atmosphere was substantially warmer than in 1965, possibly because of increased solar activity and proximity to sun.

with irrigation waters in Egypt and damaging fertile Nile delta by interfering with ancient silting process. In U.S., oil leaks from ocean floor set off by scientific drilling techniques had ruined Santa Barbara, Calif., coast. “Monstrous engines” of Boeing 747, Concorde supersonic airliner, C—5A Galaxy jet, and sst would “spew their poisons on mankind.” Could man master anything that really mattered? “Certainly not nature, and least of all himself; rather it is altogether likely that if the Biblical flood someday engulfs the earth, it will flow from seeded clouds.

•	House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space
Science and Applications published Future of the Bioscience Program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Report concluded bioscientific experimentation on man and animals in first decade of space flight had been “relatively meager.” Scientific research on manned flight had been “minimal” and had not included biomedical experimentation of kind done in Biosatellite program. More research was urgently needed on biological influence of zero gravity and effects of change or elimination of rhythmic daily periodicity of animal and plant life on earth. Space technology now permitted advanced scientific research on these and related biological factors.
While professors exchanged scientific theories freely, NASA representatives inclined toward “protecting jurisdiction authority and extending organizational power within the framework of their agency.” Complete information exchange should prevail, especially in bioscience, “which eventually may affect human life.” “Rivalry” between science and engineering was “real.” In NASA, science was “used” but “rarely accepted in its own right by the engineering management.”
While knowledge from 14-day missions was adequate to proceed with planning of 28-day aap mission, it was inadequate to proceed safely with proposed 56-day flight or longer planetary flights without monitoring astronauts on 28-day mission in experiments “beyond any yet undertaken in manned flight.” Further biosatellite exploration with primates and instruments was “merited if not indeed prescribed.” Final evaluation of Biosatellite 111 would determine new mechanisms and improved monitoring of test mammals to be programmed.
Subcommittee endorsed proposal of Dr. W. Ross Adey, NASA’s principal investigator for Biosatellite III, that basic measurements be required on all flight crews and recommended reinstitution of biosatellite experiments with animals in earth orbit, extension of bioscience research to planets when technologically feasible, uprating of science role as mission objective, and nasa and Congress delegation of “highest relative priority” to “bioscience programs which offer the most immediate return to the taxpayers through . . . medicine and physiology.” Subcommittee further recommended NASA examine and implement “to fullest practicable extent” recommendations of President’s Scientific Advisory Panel for “new level of biomedical research capability,” that OMSF conduct biomedical experiments on astronauts during 28-day aap missions, and that NASA’s scientific investigations be planned “with close and continued participation of the academic research institutions.” (Text)

December 26: Studies of shock and thermal metamorphism of olivine trachy-hasalt by nuclear explosion at Nevada Test Site for comparison studies of Apollo 11 lunar samples were described in Science. Preliminary examination of Apollo 11 lunar surface material suggested many samples would be mafic igneous rocks showing shock metamorphism produced by meteorite impact. (James, Science, 12/26/69, 1615—9) December 26—31: American Assn, for the Advancement of Science held 136th meeting in Boston, Mass. Panel discussion of future of U.S. space program was disrupted by some 50 student protesters who converged on panel chairman Dr. Charles Stark Draper, former director of mit’s Instrumentation Laboratory, and participants. Protesters said they objected to space program because funds could be better spent to solve social ills on earth. They littered podium with signs and papier-mache moon rock. Dr. Draper justified continuation of space program because of its technological and prestige contributions. “Space is a bargain.”
Outgoing aaas president Dr. Walter Orr Roberts met continued objections in his attempt to justify space program on basis of applications and was almost shouted down when he suggested U.S.—u.s.s.R. cooperation in internationalized space stations. In presidential address Dr. Roberts, President of University Corp. for Atmospheric Research, said space technology had “vastly enlarged the arsenals of the United States and the U.S.S.R., bringing to reality hitherto fanciful modes of military surveillance, communications, and weaponry.” Time had come “for us to take a bold new step in space. I propose that this nation call upon the Soviet Union to join hands in space, with a jointly conducted, earth-oriented space program that will put the new-found Soviet and American skills in space to work for the direct benefit of man.”
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northwestern Univ. astronomer and consultant to usaf Project Blue Book, expressed fear that usaf would destroy classified UFO records because of Dec. 17 termination of project. “I do not believe we are being visited by little green men. ... I do believe a phenomenon exists, and that it is worthy of scientific attention.”
Dr. Lewis M. Branscomb, Director of National Bureau of Standards, and Dr. Gordon J. F. MacDonald, Vice Chancellor of Univ. of California at Santa Barbara, called for hard, new look at manned space flight spending and urged moratorium on pressure for early manned missions to Mars.
Dr. S. Fred Singer, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Interior, said, “If we downgrade the manned space program we may find we don’t have any space program.”
Panel of young scientists from Harvard Univ. and mit, invited by aaas, attacked “misuse” of science in formal papers presented before

Theory had originally been proposed by British astronomer Sir James Jeans early in century. (Lannan, W Star, 12/28/69, A7; W Post, 12/27/69, B6; 12/29/69, Al, A7; 12/30/69, A2; Science, 1/2/70, 11-6)
December 27: Scientists from U.S., Canada, and France, participating in NASA-sponsored 25-day probe of aurora borealis Nov. 24 to Dec. 18, had discovered very high ratios of red oxygen emissions to blue nitrogen emissions in earth’s upper atmosphere, NASA announced. Higher measured ratios indicated many solar electrons that bombarded atmosphere might have been low energy. There might be more oxygen in polar atmosphere than at other latitudes, or high temperatures in upper polar atmosphere. Studies in airborne laboratory—NASA Convair 990 jet aircraft Galileo—also detected bombardment of earth’s atmosphere by protons. Comparison of light emission caused by protons and electrons would help explain particles’ origin. Measurement from six photometers and three spectrometers would provide explanation of newly discovered phenomena, (nasa Releases 69—165, 69—169)

The success of this mission has opened new fields of exploration and research . . . which will lead to a greater understanding of our planet and provide a new insight into the origin and history of the solar system.”
Report included photographic review of Apollo 11 mission with observations by crew—Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., and Michael Collins. Descriptions of geologic setting of lunar material, soil mechanics investigation, passive seismic experiment, laser ranging retroreflector, and solar wind composition experiment were provided by principal investigators.
In addition to major findings reported Sept. 15 in summary by NASA Preliminary Examination Team (pet), SP—214 reported passive seismic experiment package deployed on moon had operated satisfactorily for 21 days and had detected seismic signals from astronaut activity or lm motions. Whether actual lunar seismic events had been detected was uncertain. Laser reflector deployed on moon had been used as target for earth-based lasers and distance to moon had been measured to within four-mile accuracy. Future studies would be made on distance variation to study motion of moon and earth. Preliminary analysis had been made on part of aluminum foil and showed helium, neon, and argon; isotopic composition of each element had been measured. (Text; NASA Release 69—160)

•	Space/Aeronautics described 1969 as U.S.S.R.’s “most active and most
frustrating” year in space. “In the fall of 1968 it was possible to believe . . . that the Soviet Union might fly men around the moon before the United States. A year later it was possible to ask: ‘Where are the Russians?’” Most failures were in attempts to prepare man’s way to moon. “The inglorious performance of Luna 15, just as America was landing men on the lunar surface, could almost be called the least of Russia’s lunar problems. By far the worst . . . must be repeated technical troubles with the long-awaited ‘super booster,’ the rough equivalent of Saturn 5. If semi-official rumors are to be accepted as accurate, the Russian vehicle is in a great deal of difficulty.
“The . . . launchings of Soyuz 6, 7, and 8 were impressive in many ways—but Western officials still counted the group flight as a disappointment to the Russians. . . . The most skeptical Western estimates now are that the Russians may have abandoned the big booster, that they will not land men on the moon before 1972 . . . and that no large Soviet station will be assembled in orbit before the last half of the ’70s.” {Space/Aeronautics, 12/69, 24—6)

•	In American Scholar architect R. Buckminster Fuller said: “It seems
eminently clear that we not only must put our space programs on highest priority of attention and resource investment but that all humanity must be accredited and financed to enter into a new re-educational system that is geared to develop our most prominent awareness, that we indeed are in space and that all of our concern is with the fact that our space-vehicle Earth and its life-energy-giving Sun, and the tide-pumping Moon can provide ample sustenance and power for all humanity’s needs to be derived from our direct energy income without further robbing our fossil fuels energy savings account. In reality, the
Sun, the Earth and the Moon are nothing else than a most fantastically well-designed and space-programmed team of vehicles. All of us are, always have been, and so long as we exist, always will be—nothing else but—astronauts. Let’s pull our heads out of the brain benumbing, mind frustrating, misinformedly conditioned reflexes. If it is going to be ‘All ashore who’s going ashore,’ once more intent to return to nonspace down here ON earth, humanity is doomed.” (American Scholar, Winter 1969-70, 27-47)
During 1969: In 1969—the year man first set foot on another celestial body —U.S. orbited 54 spacecraft and U.S.S.R., 70. U.S. total included 31 orbited by DOD. NASA’s 23 included 2 satellites orbited for dod as secondary payloads.
Highlight of 1969 was achievement of major goal in NASA’s Apollo program—to land man on the moon and return him safely to earth. Lunar landing system completed final phases of test and demonstration when Apollo 9 demonstrated operation of LM in earth orbit and Apollo 10 demonstrated operation of complete Apollo spacecraft in lunar orbit, with LM making two passes within 47,000 ft of lunar surface. Apollo program climaxed with Apollo 11, July 16—24, when LM Eagle landed on moon and Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. —first men on the moon—performed tasks on lunar surface, redocked with csm in lunar orbit, and returned safely to earth with lunar samples. Apollo 12 successfully accomplished second manned lunar landing with pinpoint accuracy, touching down close to Surveyor 111, which had landed on moon April 19, 1967. Crew set up first alsep on lunar surface and returned safely to earth with lunar samples and parts of Surveyor III.
Unmanned Mariner VI and Mariner VII passed within 2,000 mi of Mars, transmitting more than 200 times more data about Mars than were obtained by Mariner IV in 1964. Spacecraft measured chemical composition and temperature of atmosphere and surface and took 198 high-quality pictures, providing new insight into Mars surface characteristics. Other scientific achievements included orbiting of Oso V, Oso VI, Ogo VI, and Explorer XL1. Applications satellites included Intelsat-Ill F—3, Intelsat-III F—4, and Intelsat-III F—5 for ComSat-Corp; Essa IX meteorological satellite for essa; Nimbus III; and Ats V. Biosatellite 111 provided significant biological data on instrumented monkey on board, but mission was terminated early after monkey’s physiological condition deteriorated, and monkey died shortly after recovery. Pioneer E, scheduled to enter solar orbit, and its secondary payload tetr—c were destroyed shortly after launch when Delta booster malfunctioned.
Some 189 meteorological sounding rockets, 85 scientific sounding rockets, and 60 high-altitude balloons were launched.
NASA—usaf XB—70 and X—15 programs were concluded and new joint program was initiated to continue aeronautical R&d, using YF—12 supersonic aircraft. First operational C—5A, military cargo transport and world’s largest aircraft, was delivered to usaf and by November seven C—5As had accumulated 1,320 hrs flying time. Aeronautical R&d continued to improve quality and quantity of options available in aircraft technology, and aircraft industry made first flights of several wide-bodied jumbo jet transports for civil use, including Boeing 747.
New SST design with delta wing was approved by faa and prototype construction was recommended by President Nixon.
NASA’s HL—10 lifting-body vehicle completed 3 successful glide flights and 15 powered flights included first supersonic flight at mach 1.1 and
54,000-ft altitude, usaf’s X—24A lifting-body vehicle completed 7 flights.
dod space program included orbiting of 2 Vela nuclear-detection satellites, 7 Orbiting Vehicle research satellites, Tacsat I tactical comsat, Egrs XIII (Secor XIII) geodetic satellite (launched by NASA), and U.K.’s Skynet A comsat (launched by NASA). Titan HIM development was terminated and usaf’s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) program was canceled because of budget cutbacks.
NASA and aec completed ground tests of xe experimental rocket engine with 28 successful startups and 2.8 hrs of operation, including
3.5	min at full thrust, and validated test stand No. 1 in Jackass Flats, Nev. SNAP—27 generator was used as electrical power source for Apollo 12 experiments left on moon and SNAP—19 was auxiliary power system for Nimbus III. SNAP—29 program was terminated. New liquid-propellant rocket engine was developed and new triprapellant system produced record performance for chemically powered engines.
U.S.S.R.’s 70 payloads included 55 Cosmos satellites and 2 Intercosmos, 2 Meteor, 1 Luna, 1 Zond, 5 Soyuz, and 2 Venus spacecraft, and 2 Molniya I comsats. Manned Soyuz IV docked with manned Soyuz V and two cosmonauts transferred from Soyuz V to Soyuz IV before returning to earth. Manned Soyuz VI, VII, and VIII, launched on three successive days, rendezvoused in orbit and performed experiments including photography, communications, and welding. Luna XV, apparent unmanned challenger to NASA’s Apollo 11 for first lunar landing and return, crashed onto lunar surface in July. U.S.S.R.’s Tu-144 delta-wing supersonic transport successfully reached speeds up to 900 mph and was demonstrated publicly in 90-min test flight.

• Year 1969 was one of critical decision and realignment of programs for NASA as primary goal of first decade was achieved through Apollo program. Post-Apollo planning had preceded the coming of the Nixon Administration and Apollo 11. Budget retrenchment accelerated throughout Government as cost of Vietnam war continued high and White House sought to lessen inflation by fiscal economy. Nationwide reevaluation of societal; priorities emphasized problems of pollution, poverty, and crime.
Successful lunar landings of Apollo 11 and 12—seen and acclaimed worldwide—mushroomed U.S. enthusiasm for manned space achievement. NASA announced development of plans for further lunar missions and post-Apollo planetary exploration. But year was turning point, with completion of a major goal and examination of possible new goals and priorities for the next decade. Phasing down of Apollo program after climax brought shifts in program emphasis and in personnel. Most of initial Saturn V launch vehicles had been completed. Hardware requirements would decrease as missions slowed. Peak costs during 1960s had built NASA base of people, technology, and facilities as national capability to conduct space missions.
Future space objectives and budget options were examined, within
Government and outside, for .balance between more manned missions and more unmanned scientific exploration and applications of knowledge already gained. Criticism of past emphasis on engineering rather than on science was partly answered by decision to provide more time for scientific study and planning between the next Apollo lunar missions. Program plans included Apollo Applications, missions to Mars and Jupiter, long-range studies of Venus-Mercury mission and three-planet grand tours, development of permanent space station, joint NASA—DOD studies of space transportation system with reusable shuttle, and accelerated aeronautics activities.
nasa FY 1970 appropriation of $3,697 billion was $181 million below budget proposed by outgoing President Johnson and $19 million below President Nixon’s amended request for $3,716 billion. Cutbacks in Government spending forced NASA to announce 1970 closing of Electronics Research Center and DOD to cancel Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) program. Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, NASA Administrator, told ERC employees in December that agency had to “effect reductions and consolidation across the board if we are to shape our programs to meet the nation’s future needs in aeronautics and space.” Reductions in work force—largely in contractor personnel—were brought by planned phasing out of Apollo program as well as by budget cuts. Year of man’s first landing on moon, despite its global impact, ended with space goals and levels of effort for the next decade an open question. (Pres Rpt 70 [69]; A&A 69)
• In its international cooperation program, NASA successfully launched three foreign satellites—Canadian Isis /, third of series to conduct ionospheric measurement; Boreas (Esro IB) for European Space Research Organization on reimbursable basis; and West German Azur under cooperative project to conduct radiation belt measurements. Agreements for new projects were reached with U.K., Italy, Netherlands, and Canada. U.K. agreement called for 1971 launch of satellite on NASA Scout vehicle to measure ionospheric particles and radio noise and experiment to fly on board NASA’s Nimbus-E in 1972. Italian agreement provided for 1970 launch of San Marco-C satellite on NASA Scout vehicle from Italian San Marco range in Indian Ocean and use of range for launching NASA spacecraft into equatorial orbit.
Under Netherlands agreement two Dutch scientists would participate as observers in OAO program. Canadian agreement called for reimbursement launching of Canadian comsat. Project Helios, cooperative endeavor with West German Ministry for Scientific Research to place two solar probes (1974—1975) closer to sun than any other spacecraft, would obtain data on solar processes and earth-sun relationship. Under another agreement with West Germany, Project Aeros, NASA would launch German-developed satellite in 1972 for aeronomy measurements. In agreement with Indian space agency, ATS—F satellite would be made available for experimental educational TV broadcasting directly and by relay to receivers in 5,000 Indian villages.
Additional cooperative projects during 1969 included launch of one Italian, two U.K., and two French experiments; continuation of sounding rocket projects with Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, and Sweden; inclusion of Canadian and French experiments on Convair 990 flights to study auroras in northern lati-
tudes; and extension of aeronautical research projects with Canada, France, West Germany, and U.K. Agreement with Spain for NASA Madrid tracking station was extended in June until 1984 and negotiations were begun with Australia for extension of tracking arrangements until same year.
Lunar surface material returned by Apollo 11 astronauts was distributed to 39 principal investigators from nine countries—Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, West Germany, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, and U.K.
International highlights in 1969 included around-the-world tour of Apollo 11 astronauts to dramatize conviction that successful lunar landing was triumph for all mankind; travels of NASA Administrator, Dr. Thomas 0. Paine, to inform ministerial and space agency officials abroad of U.S. space plans and invite their participation; and participation of foreign experts in NASA conference on space shuttle concepts.
Efforts by NASA to develop cooperative programs with U.S.S.R. continued during 1969, but met with limited success. (Pres Rpt 70 [69])
• Drone aircraft was reportedly impaled with spear of light from experi-
mental laser and destroyed in three milliseconds at Air Force Special Weapons Laboratory, Kirtland afb, N. Mex. Account in Aviation Week & Space Technology was later denied by usaf officials.
Tri-service laser weapon research programs, principally sponsored by arpa, were studying number of military applications of lasers, according to magazine, usaf had increased planned funding of high-energy gas laser development in FY 1969 from $0.5 million to $2.5 million to make use of power output increase achieved by United Aircraft Corp. in 1968. And $1.5 million had been given to exploratory development of high-power solid-state lasers. For FY 1970 usaf had asked $8 million to exploit United Aircraft development.

•	Aerospace industry sales of $28.3 billion in 1969 were second highest in
industry’s history despite anticipated decline of 4.1% from 1968 record of $29.5 billion. All areas of aerospace endeavor leveled off except nonaerospace sales by aerospace companies, which increased. Commercial aerospace sales, principally jet transports, were $5,800 million, down from $6,429 million in 1968. Trend resulted from phasing out of current transport models while jumbo jet production was beginning. Sales by aerospace industry to dod were $16.2 million in 1969 and $16.6 billion in 1968. Military aircraft sales totaled $10 billion in 1969 and $10.7 billion in 1968. Space sales dropped to $4,499 million from $5,108 million in 1968, because of approaching completion of Apollo program hardware phase and cancellation of mol. (Aerospace, Winter, 1970)
•	U.S. scheduled airlines carriedT59 million passengers; in 1949 they had
carried less than 17 million. In 1969 airlines accounted for 75% of common carrier passenger-miles between U.S. cities; in 1949 they had accounted for 14%. In 1969 18.3 million passengers flew between U.S. and other countries; in 1949 there were 2.2 million. U.S. scheduled airlines produced 3.2 billion ton-miles of air freight service in 1969, increase of 15.7% over 1968. (1970 Air Transport Facts & Figures)
•	Air carrier accidents decreased from 73 in 1968 to 68 in 1969. Accident
rate was down from 1.12 per 100,000 hrs flown to 0.98. Fatal accidents
had dropped from 16 to 10 and total fatalities from 352 to 160, lowest since 1957. Fatality rate was 2.3 per 100,000 hrs flown; it had been 5.4 in 1968. Total air carrier accidents had declined steadily from 102 in 1959 to 1969’s 68. (faa Release 70—2)
•	Number of active pilots in U.S. reached 720,028, rise of 4% over 1968
total. Student pilots dropped 3% from end of 1968, to 203,520 at end of 1969. (faa Release 70—37)
•	Best seller of books published by New York Times during year was We
Reach the Moon by John Noble Wilford. Book sold 1 million copies in U.S. and abroad. (NYT, 2/22/70)
