January 2: Spanish scientists had submitted to the Spanish government a five-year, $10,000,000 space research program, the Chicago Tribune reported. According to Comision Nacional de Investigacion del Espacio (conie) President Gen. Rafael Calvo Rodes, primary program objectives would be to gather scientific data and gain practical experience in designing and launching rockets. During separate, $1,500,000 preparatory program which was completed in December 1966, Spain launched her first rocket, collected data, conducted preliminary experiments, trained technical personnel, and prepared permanent launching sites; during next phase, Spain would build her own Skua rockets.

•	Aerospace industry must develop new type of management to cope with its
record $26-billion workload during 1967, Robert Hotz wrote in Aviation Week. “What makes the current management problem so acute is the fact that military demands are reaching a peak at the same time that commercial aviation is soaring on the greatest boom in its history. During 1965, the aerospace industry actually manufactured slightly more commercial airframe pounds than military—a historic milestone. The industry also has under development six new types of airline jet transports for which there were no prior military programs and which must be financed from privately raised funds. This is another unprecedented task for aerospace managements to tackle. . . .” (Hotz, Av Wk, 1/2/67, 11)
•	U.S. experts believed establishment of permanent lunar colonies and ex-

Analysis of research reports had indicated that future Soviet missions directed toward these objectives would include: (1) orbiting of three or four cosmonauts for three weeks; (2) extensive practice of extravehicular activity and assembly in orbit; (3) orbiting of animals to continue studying effects of long-term weightlessness and radiation; and (4) lunar landing of animals for observation. David predicted preparations for interplanetary travel would be initiated shortly after establishment of permanent lunar colonies. (David, Tech Wk, 1/2/61, 18) .
•	The New York Times called for fuller and more open debate on cost and
consequences of SST program: “The sst’s priority is debatable and so is its financing. The industry may be right in asserting that the costs of development are so huge that no company can afford to take the risk on its own. It points out that the backing of both Britain and France has been required to launch the Concorde. But if the combined efforts of two countries and their aircraft industries are needed for that much less ambitious project, the American sst might be more safely and soundly developed if it commanded the combined resources of the entire American industry and the Government.
“What is at stake is not the commitment to proceed with the sst. That decision has been made and cannot—and should not—be reversed. But if the sst is to be sound economically as well as technologically, the Administration and the industry must be less secretive and indefinite about the costs and how they are to be financed. An open debate is needed on how to get the most for the taxpayers’ money.” (NYT, 1/2/67,18)

“It is a mistake to think of the space program only in terms of the * rockets and spacecraft we launch. These are the focal points of our attention, but we are also developing the ability to organize and manage vast scientific and technical enterprises that involve large segments of our economic, social, and political decision-making process.

•	Press briefing on future ossa programs was held at nasa Hq. Edgar M.
Cortright, Deputy Administrator for Space Science and Applications, served as moderator.
Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell stressed the importance of basic research to all national scientific programs. “. . . the results of basic research are vital to the realization of practical applications. When we began the NASA program, we had the sounding rocket, we had the capability of putting together small satellite launchers and to apply those techniques, and we built the best program on those techniques that we could. Now we have manned flight capabilities; we have large boosters, the ability to get out further into the solar system than ever before. . . . Now is the time to profit by those capabilities, to continue the basic research.”
Sunblazer probe that could be launched into orbit around the sun
and transmit radio signals back to earth was discussed by Jesse L. Mitchell, Director of Physics and Astronomy Programs. Spacecraft would determine electron density in solar atmosphere by measuring time it took signals to travel from spacecraft back to earth. NASA was also considering a plan to launch a satellite toward Jupiter, then use Jupiter’s magnetic field to push the spacecraft toward other planets and eventually hurl it into space 1-10 trillion miles away.
Oran W. Nicks, Director of Lunar and Planetary Programs, outlined plans for unmanned missions to Mars and Venus, beginning with a small instrumented probe scheduled for launch in June 1967. In the 1971 Mars and 1972 Venus missions, teams of two spacecraft would be launched by a modified Saturn V booster. One spacecraft would penetrate planet’s atmosphere; take measurements as it sped toward planet’s surface; and flash data to the second spacecraft— programed to fly past the planet—before crashlanding. Data would be transmitted to earth by the flyby spacecraft. Missions would pave the way for later spacecraft with improved equipment—possibly including TV cameras—to softland on the planets.
Thumb-sized desert mice fitted with tiny radio transmitters and telemetry equipment which could broadcast mouse’s temperature up to six months were being conditioned for future space flight, Dr. Orr E. Reynolds, Director of Bioscience Programs, disclosed. “Astromouse”—which ate only sunflower seeds and never drank water—might be orbited with three astronauts in Apollo spacecraft. Others might be launched into interplanetary space in a Pioneer study of biological specimens outside earth’s gravitational field.
Plans for a multi-purpose satellite that would combine the functions of many unmanned spacecraft currently in orbit were revealed by Dr. Morris Tepper, Deputy Director of Space Applications and Director of Meteorology. Developed under unified space applications program, satellite would carry equipment to observe weather conditions; relay communications to distant earth stations; provide navigation traffic control for ships and aircraft; and compile data on earth’s natural resources.
No mention of unmanned scientific lunar probes was made during the briefing. When asked later in an interview whether he thought interest in unmanned exploration of the moon would diminish after astronauts landed, Dr. Newell replied: “Not at all.” Although astronauts would dominate lunar exploration, unmanned Surveyor spacecraft would probably land in unsafe areas, and Lunar Orbiter photography missions would continue for mapping. Discussion of unmanned lunar missions had been omitted because “we wanted to tell about the newer of new things in our thinking.” (Transcript; Hines, W Star, 1/8/67, A16)

Unlike previous proposals involving distant observations, Nowitzky’s concept called for an automated spacecraft landing on a planet’s surface to make tests free from earthly contamination and influence. A soil sample would be taken, mixed with distilled water, and sterilized. Part of the resulting “nutrient” would be transferred to a test chamber, exposed to the planet’s atmosphere, and sealed, while the remaining part would be used as a “control.” Sensors in the test chamber would register any metabolic reaction, and these data would be telemetered to earth or to an orbiting satellite.

January 13: Lunar Orbiter news briefing was held at nasa Hq.
Dr. Leonard Reiffel, Apollo Program, omsf, said that 635 Lunar Orbiter I and II photos of the 1,000-mi Apollo strip near moon’s equator had “removed any doubt that there are numbers of suitable places for Apollo to land satisfactorily.” Of the regions photographed, 10 sites appeared to have smooth areas; detailed analysis of three of these had revealed two areas that were only about 6% crater-marked. Dr. Reiffel said Apollo landing site should be 3- to 5-mi-dia oval area, relatively free of craters and boulders, with 30 mi of smooth terrain approaching it and no more than 7° slope. In addition, since moon’s optimum light
ranged from 7° to 20° and sun moved across moon 13° per day, landing sites ideally should be spaced 26° apart at this longitude to allow for launch delays. “We . . . need not one site or a couple of sites ideally, but we would like, in order to make life as simple as possible, to have a number of sites. Then at the specific time of the launch ... we will pick a set of three....”
Dr. Lawrence Rowan, U.S. Geological Survey, said Lunar Orbiter photos had shown that moon’s dark mare was smoothest terrain; bright rays had variable roughness and upland plains appeared very rough. He said photos indicated that mass movement on the moon modified both mare and upland.
LaRC Lunar Orbiter Project Manager Dr. Clifford H. Nelson, discussing future Lunar Orbiter missions, said Lunar Orbiter 3 would be “site confirmation” flight to photograph areas already determined by Lunar Orbiter / and II as promising for Apollo landings. Spacecraft 4 and 5 might be used to photograph 400 lunar sites of primary scientific interest. Capt. Lee R. Scherer, Lunar Orbiter Project Manager, ossa, noted that one Lunar Orbiter in polar orbit around the moon could survey 80% of moon’s front face with 10 times resolution of earth-based photos. “These types of missions would provide a framework upon which to base major decisions concerning our total lunar exploration program after these initial manned landings,” Scherer said.

•	V/Adm. Hyman G. Rickover (usn) received Printing Industries of Metro-
politan New York’s Franklin Award for “advancement of scientific knowledge and furtherance of democracy.” In his acceptance speech, Admiral Rickover said citizens in a democracy had a duty to become educated so they could support social action against harmful technologies. “There is a knowledge gap of vast dimension between the public and that small elite of highly intelligent, highly educated experts who understand science and have the use of technology. ... A free society cannot, in the long run, bear the burden of having a mass of voters who lack the education they need to make them responsible citizens. Society ceases to be free if a pattern of life develops where technology, not man, becomes central to its purpose. We must not permit this to happen lest the human liberties for which mankind has fought, at so great a cost of effort and sacrifice, be extinguished.” (Gilroy, NYT, 1/17/67,27)	_	<

•	Growing confidence that U.S. would accomplish a manned lunar land-
ing by 1970 had plunged space planners into an urgent debate over post-Apollo plans, John Wilford wrote in the New York Times. Should the U.S. concentrate on unmanned and manned exploration of Mars or Venus? An expanded lunar-oriented program? Giant manned laboratories in earth orbit for research and surveillance? Networks of communications and meteorological satellites? Or a series of instrument probes to comets, asteroids, and outer planets? Such questions had opened a searching reexamination into the value of space exploration, and some critics were urging a less ambitious and costly program, with more emphasis “on the problems that confront us here on earth.” While the debate continued, nasa was said to favor concentrating on manned orbiting laboratories that would exploit present technology. Although a broad range of space goals was considered attainable in the next two decades, NASA officials said failure to define post-Apollo objectives soon could cause U.S. to find itself unprepared to achieve any major space goal before the mid-1970s.

• Technology Week marked beginning of its second decade of publishing by asking some of the Nation’s leading educators, scientists, and engineers to project their goals for technology, aec Chairman Dr. Glenn T. Sea-borg emphasized the need for man to first choose goals for technology: . . we must give more thought to guiding the direction of our technological future.
“. . . if there are any ultimate goals for technology we will know what they are only when we all agree on the goals of man.”
MSFC Director Dr. Wernher von Braun proposed an earth resources management system employing space technology—principally, resourcesensing satellites—to meet the needs of the world’s rapidly growing population. Said Dr. von Braunam firmly convinced that one of the great future contributions of our space program will be in helping to manage more effectively the utilization of our world resources.”
In discussing long-delayed peaceful application of nuclear explosions—Project Plowshare—Dr. Edward Teller, Associate Director of Lawrence Radiation Lab., suggested that questions of safety, fear of the unknown, limited nuclear test ban, and international politics were chief obstacles to program. Until these obstacles were removed, Plowshare would continue to lie dormant.
Prof. Isaac Asimov, Boston Univ. School of Medicine, foresaw that mankind, now faced with the practical need for working under low-gravity conditions, would have to develop “low-gravity engineering.” Low-gravity engineering might also prove useful in future exploration beneath the sea.
Dr. Joshua Lederberg, Professor of Genetics at Stanford Univ. School of Medicine, proposed that man’s central technological goal was the harmonization of his technical goals, a process Dr. Lederberg called “eutechnics.” He went on to declare: “In the eutechnical society, the penultimate crime may become to introduce any technological innovation as a subsystem benefit without analyzing its impact on the whole future of man. The ultimate one would be to deny man his humanity by denying him the chance to think, to know himself.”
Dr. Charles S. Draper, head of mit’s Aeronautics and Astronautics Dept., emphasized the need to establish an adequate balance between “directly beneficial” and “remedial” technologies. As air and water pollution, land damage from mining, soil erosion, and other problems become acute, man must give more thought to remedial actions for disturbances inflicted on the environment. Dr. Draper suggested space vehicle technology as “. . . an excellent model for the technology of overall environmental control for the earth.”
Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (usaf, Ret.), former afsc Commander, believed that the big challenge of the next 25 yrs would be the effective management of technology for the public good. Schriever suggested that: “the systems management concept [developed in Nation’s military and space programs] will be required to bring these technologies to bear on these problems. ; . .”
Clarence L. Johnson, Lockheed Aircraft Corp. Vice President, listed 10 aerospace projects which, he felt, should receive major attention
during next 20 yrs. Among these projects were use of nuclear power plants in aerial transports to reduce fuel-to-cargo ratios, solution of sonic boom problems, and development of high-density fuels.
Dr. Athelstan F. Spilhaus, dean of Univ. of Minnesota’s Institute of Technology, explored the objectives and benefits of geotechnology— use of geophysical and geochemical knowledge “to intervene in the natural processes of our environment on a massive—and even global— scale.” Dr. Spilhaus said he believed the public would “. . . welcome ... an imaginative experiment in city living designed to remove the chores, dirt, delays, and human wastage, and emphasize the opportunities for social, cultural, economic and recreational advantages that high-density living provides.”
In final article, TRW Vice Chairman Simon Ramo wrote: “We are in the science era of mankind; we are not yet in the social era of mankind. ... A quick look at our society shows that science’s greatest challenge now and for the next few decades is for the application of science to human needs.” (Tech Wk, 1/23/67, 32-79)

January 23—27: Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics, sponsored by Yeshiva Univ., Univ. of Texas, Southwest Center for Advanced Studies, and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, was held in New York City. In opening session, Dr. Allan R. Sandage of Mt. Palomar Observatory announced observation of what was apparently the greatest explosion ever recorded by man. Explosion occurred in quasar 3C—446 many million or billions of years ago, and caused it to increase in brilliance 20-fold in a matter of weeks or months.
Cal Tech’s Dr. Maarten Schmidt told conference of a new quasar, pks 0237-23, that appeared to be farther from earth than any other reported to date, pks 0237-23, receding at 80% the speed of light, was most remarkable, however, because it displayed two “red shifts”—displacement toward red end of the light spectrum as objects speed away. If both shifts were indicators of velocity,, it would mean that part of the quasar was receding from earth 17,000 mps more slowly than the rest.
Dr. Riccardo Giacconi of American Science and Engineering, Inc.,
and Dr. Sandage reported that second starlike source of intense x rays had been discovered by Oct. 11 sounding rocket and later telescopic observation. Of 30 known x-ray sources, only one had previously been linked to a starlike object. Finding of second source, located in Constellation Cygnus, persuaded a number of astronomers that such visible objects represented a new type of celestial phenomenon, perhaps related to the manner in which stars are formed.
Princeton Univ. physicist Dr. Robert H. Dicke revealed an observation that might invalidate Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Dr. Dicke told the conference that his experiments showed the sun to he flattened at the poles and that the oblateness was sufficient to explain a significant portion of Mercury’s orbital behavior, without recourse to relativity. It was the precise conformity of Mercury’s orbit to Dr. Einstein’s predictions that was the chief pillar of his theory. “It wouldn’t surprise me if general relativity is just plain wrong,” Dr. Dicke commented. {NYT, 1/24/67,22; 1/26/67,18; 1/28/67,1,12; 1/29/67,621
January 24: President Johnson’s message to Congress on the FY 1968 budget said in part: “In 1961, this Nation resolved to send a manned expedition to the moon in this decade. Much hard work remains and many obstacles must still be overcome before that goal is met. Yet, in the last few years we have progressed far enough that we must now look beyond our original objective and set our course for the more distant future . . . we have no alternative unless we wish to abandon the manned space capability we have created.
“This budget provides for the initiation of an effective follow-on to the manned lunar landing. We will explore the moon. We will learn to live in space for months at a time. Our astronauts will conduct scientific and engineering experiments in space to enhance man’s mastery of the environment. . . .” The President recommended that nasa proceed with the Voyager program for an unmanned landing on Mars in 1973 and continue “other unmanned investigations nearer the earth. . . .
“These new ventures are the result of careful planning and selectivity,” Mr. Johnson said. “We are not doing everything in space that we are technologically capable of doing ... we are choosing those projects that give us the greatest return on our investment. . . .” (Text, CR, 1/24/67, S755)
• President Johnson submitted his FY 1968 Budget Request to Congress. Total space budget recommended was $7,242 billion. Of this sum, nasa would receive $5,050 billion; dod, $1,998 billion; AEC, $151.6 million; essa, $34.8 million; U.S. Geological Survey, $4.8 million; Agricultural Research Service, $.4 million; and nsf, $2.8 million.
NASA FY 1968 budget would keep Project Apollo on schedule and provide major hardware funding for several new programs: (1) $454.7 million for Apollo Applications (aa) ; (2) $71.5 million for Voyager;
(3)	$68.9 million for Mariner to provide for Mariner/Mars 1971 program; (4) $2 million for five Sunblazer missions to study solar corona;
(5)	$35.5 million for Applications Technology Satellite (ats) to provide new configuration with large directable antenna; and (6) $2.3 million for Voice Broadcast Satellite. Funding for aeronautics research almost doubled from $35.9 million in FY 1967 to $66.8 million with most of increase attributable to increased study of X-15 and XB-70 aircraft, hypersonic ramjet, aircraft noise reduction, delta X-15 aircraft, and sst. Programs terminated or deferred by FY 1968 budget included Jupiter
probe, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter (no follow-on funds), large solid motor project, Atlas-Agena combination, and new launch vehicle development. $b0-$100 million were placed in President’s Contingency Fund pending decision on development of Nerva nuclear propulsion system.
Major portions of dod’s space budget would be spent on: (1) Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol)—$430 million; (2) Titan III—C launch vehicle; and (3) military comsats. Most of essa’s funds would support increased activity on satellite sensors'and systems in support of World Weather Watch and improved techniques for weather forecasts, river and flood prediction, and other warning services.

NASA Administrator James Webb said: “. . . I believe that on this budget we can build an excellent foundation for the work that we as a nation will need to do in 1970 and heyond.
“I believe it is a balanced program that makes the best use of the resources that we have created since 1958. I believe it includes those items that enable the Congress and the country to clearly see and judge the issues which are basic to our future in space.
“I believe it assumes success. That is, that it is a minimum budget for the work that is required and does not provide for losses of stages or for unexpected catastrophes such as are always a possibility in this program.
“. . . finally, I believe that this budget indicates that we have proven in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that the space capability of this nation can be developed, that this job he is putting in this budget can be done, and I believe it indicates clearly that he believes it is important that we continue to develop our national space capability. . . .” (Transcript)

•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb, testifying at Senate Committee on
Aeronautical and Space Sciences’ hearings on aeronautical r&d, recommended establishing a “civil aircraft technology” to counteract growing divergence between requirements for civil and military aircraft systems. Webb observed that most modern military aircraft could not be readily redesigned into economical commercial systems: “When unit costs were low and interaction between the elements of the design were small, a manufacturer could afford a substantial element of uncertainty to developing a new airplane, since it was not too difficult or costly to correct deficiencies exposed during flight operations. . . .” With the complexities of modern aircraft, however, deficiencies would lead to
“major escalations in cost and could mean financial disaster for a commercial venture. . . . Economics thus require the designer to take an increasingly conservative approach in applying new and advanced concepts. . . .” This conservatism was causing an increasing gap between “the advanced technology that research indicates is possible and the technology actually being used in commerce. To assure pre-eminence in aeronautics, advanced technology must continually be incorporated into new designs. . . .”
Webb said NASA was working closely with Dept, of Transportation and faa to identify and solve critical and specialized civil aviation technology requirements.

• Orbiting satellites could survive Van Allen radiation belts 10 to 100 times longer than originally estimated if their outer shells were shaped like spheres, Dr. Charles Mack, mit Lincoln Lab, suggested .at aiaa’s Aerospace Sciences Meeting in New York. Basing his prediction on results from new MIT-developed technique to simulate Van Allen belts', Dr. Mack said that radiation would always strike the surface of a sphere at wide angles, improving the chances of scattering and thereby decreasing the amount of absorption. Ideal spacecraft would be 10-ft-dia sphere with instrumentation in the core, Dr. Mack said. Most current satellites were smaller and carried instruments near surface. New York Times writer John Wilford reported that gsfc planned to have MIT-type simulator in operation by 1969. (Wilford, NYT, 1/26/67, 10)

With a budget request for fiscal 1968 of $5.05 billion, more than $500 million of it for dramatic new programs to carry us beyond a manned landing on the moon, President Johnson has made it clear that the United States is in space to stay, no matter what the Soviet Union does or does not do. ...” (W Post, 1/25/67, A18)
January 26: NASA successfully launched Essa IV, fourth meteorological satellite in essa’s Tiros Operational Satellite (tos) system, from WTH using three-stage Thor-Delta booster. Satellite achieved nearly-polar, sun-synchronous orbit with 888-mi	(1,429-km) apogee; 822-mi
(1,323-km) perigee; 113-min period; and 102° inclination. Wheel orientation maneuver was scheduled for completion during 18th orbit, at which time first photos would be programed and two-week spacecraft checkout and evaluation program would begin. /
An advanced version of the cartwheel configuration, 290-lb Essa IV carried two Automatic Picture Transmission (apt) camera systems which would photograph earth’s cloudcover and immediately transmit pictures to local apt ground stations. Essa IV was replacing Essa II in the tos system because orbital drift limited Essa II’s usefulness.
essa financed, managed, and operated tos system; gsfc was responsible for procurement, launch, and initial checkout of spacecraft in orbit. Essa I was launched Feb. 3, 1966; Essa II, Feb. 28, 1966; and Essa III, Oct. 2, 1966. (nasa Proj Off; essa Release 67-17)

•	Apollo Applications (aa) briefing was held at nasa Hq.
Dr. George E. Mueller, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, presented most detailed statement to date on the program. He said plans were to form an “embryonic space station” in 1968-69 by clustering four aa payloads launched with Uprated Saturn I boosters. First mission would be launch of manned spacecraft, followed several days later by launch of spent S-IVB stage converted into a workshop. After two spacecraft had docked, crew would enter workshop through an airlock. They would prepare workshop for storage and return to earth in their spacecraft 28 days later. In three to six months, second manned capsule would be launched on 56-day mission to deliver resupply module to workshop and rendezvous with unmanned Apollo Telescope Mount (atm), fourth and last launch in series. Cluster would be joined with multiple docking launched on S—IVB workshop. Emphasizing the importance of manning the atm, Dr. Mueller said: “. . . if there is one thing the scientific community is agreed on it is that when you want to have a major telescope instrument in space it needs to be manned.
“First of all you need him to point it. Second, you need him to be able to change the films and so on. Thirdly, you need him to maintain it so when something goes wrong he can fix it instead of having to sit here on the ground and be frustrated by the fact that some little gadget didn’t quite trip when it should have. . . .” Dr. Mueller said principal areas toward which $454.7 million FY 1968 post-Apollo effort would be directed were “development of extended flight capability, the conduct of manned astronomical and Earth observations from space, and continued exploration of the Moon.” (Transcript; Marshall Star, 2/1/67, 7-8; Clark, NYT, 1/30/67, 2; Reistrup, W Post, 1/27/67, A7)
•	In his annual “defense posture” statement to the Senate Armed Services
and Appropriations Committees, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara made a determined attempt both to persuade Congress not to insist on a U.S. antimissile defense and to dissuade the U.S.S.R. from continuing her efforts to deploy such a system. McNamara said U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles were so effective that neither country could hope to protect itself against the other in time of war, and an increase in defensive capability by one power could easily be offset by an increase in the offensive capability of the other.

204) died, apparently instantly, when flash fire swept through their Apollo I spacecraft mated to an Uprated Saturn I booster 218 ft above the ground. Crew was Virgil I. Grissom, one of seven original Mercury
astronauts; Edward H. White II, first American to walk in space; and Roger B. Chaffee, preparing for his first space flight. Accident, worst in the history of the U.S. space program, occurred at 6:31 p.m. est at ksc’s Launch Complex 34 during first major rehearsal for scheduled Feb. 21 . mission.
Immediately after tragedy, msc Director Dr. Robert Gilruth, Chairman of the Board of North American Aviation, Inc., Lee Atwood, and NASA’s Apollo Program Director m/g Samuel C. Phillips flew to Ksc from Washington, D.C. General Phillips described the accident at a press conference Jan. 28: “The facts briefly are: at 6:31 p.m. (est) the observers heard a report which originated from one of the crewmen that there was a fire aboard the spacecraft . . .” At T-10 and holding in the countdown, observers saw a “flash fire” break out inside the spacecraft, penetrate its shell, and surround its exterior with smoke. Rescue workers rushed to the pad area but could not open the hatch for five minutes. Phillips said astronauts’ only hope of escape would have to open hatch manually with a crank tool. He refused to speculate on how long accident would delay the Apollo program or on source of the fire but admitted that “if there is an ignition source ... in pure oxygen this, of course, has flash-fire potential.” His statement that spacecraft was operating on internal power when fire broke out was corrected Feb. 3 by NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans: “The fuel cells in the service module were not in use, and the so-called internal power was being supplied by batteries having the same characteristics as the fuel cells but located external to the spacecraft.”
NASA immediately appointed a board of inquiry (see Jan. 28) and announced that all data had been impounded pending its formal investigation. Unmanned Apollo flights would proceed on schedule, but manned flights were postponed until board’s inquiry was completed. Apollo I backup crew—Walter M. Schirra, Jr., Donn F.

We launched weather satellites, communications satellites and orbiting observatories. . . .
“These accomplishments—and the promise of more to come—are the fruits of the greatest concerted effort ever undertaken by any nation to advance human knowledge and activity. Space, so recently a mystery, now affects and benefits the lives of all Americans. . .
In separate chapter, National Aeronautics and Space Council (nasc) said that although U.S. continued to lead space technology competition in number and variety of successful missions, “USSR maintains its lead in weight of payloads orbited. . . . Certainly the hiatus in Soviet manned space activity during 1966 is no basis for complacency on our part as their preparations for future flights appear to be ambitious and the resources being devoted to space competence and performance are absolutely and relatively impressive.”

(2) Mid-1970s: landing of unmanned spacecraft on Mars to search for signs of life; launching of first civilian space station; operation of satellite systems to aid civilian ship and aircraft navigation and to survey earth’s natural resources; development of improved comsats; use of meteorological satellites to produce accurate long-range global weather forecasts. (3) Late 1970s: first flight of six-man spacecraft, circling Mars and returning to earth in 600 days; orbiting of giant astronomical telescope above earth’s atmosphere; establishment of semipermanent base on moon. (4) Mid-1980s: landing of men on Mars for 10-20 days of exploration. (5) The 1990s: launching of unmanned probes to Jupiter, Saturn, and perhaps other planets; longer-duration astronaut exploration of Mars; maintenance of small colony on moon; manned flights around Jupiter and Saturn.
Jerry Bishop, focusing specifically on electronic communications in second article, said that researchers were envisioning creation of a vast network of facilities over the next three decades that would use present technology—notably, comsats—to make instant audio, visual, and facsimile transmissions available worldwide. Same network would also enable computers to exchange information with each other and communicate with users located elsewhere. Although such services were not considered economically feasible at present, communications experts expressed confidence that demand for picture phones and facsimile would be high enough and costs low enough to bring about widespread introduction of the services before the end of the century.

•	Press commented on President Johnson’s failure to authorize SST prototype
construction.
New York Times: “Now the basic size and shape of the plane have been settled. . . . Yet neither [company] has been told when to quit refining the designs that resulted from a three-year, Government-sponsored competition and begin ‘cutting metal’ on flight test models—a step that had been expected on Jan. 1. The companies can take only intermediate steps until the President and the Congress decide how fast the plane should be built, how industry and Government are to divide the financial risk, and whether another, smaller plane should be built for domestic routes. . . .” (Clark, NYT, 1/8/67, E2)
Wall Street Journal: “President Johnson evidently has decided to postpone for some time the $4.5 billion [sst] program. . . . This decision . . . hasn’t been publicly disclosed, but is nonetheless obvious to Congressional and Administration officials. . . . How long the delay will last depends on whether it has resulted solely from current budget
pressures generated by the Vietnam war or is based on a belief that the growing criticism of the SST—as an allegedly costly and technically unsound project that will ‘benefit the jet set’ and be an ‘ear shattering’ nuisance to everyone else—is justified.” (Zimmerman, WSJ, 1/3/67, 2) Washington Evening Star: “Competitors in the sst sweepstakes had been hoping . . . that the winner would receive the green light to build a flyable prototype airplane right away. What Boeing and GE got instead, was a month-to-month commitment to do more of what they have been doing for 2)/> years—study, design, analyze. . . . One thing is certain about the SST program at this point: there will be no big new government funding until fiscal 1969 at the earliest.” (Hines, W Star, 1/2/67, A10)

•	Report entitled “Status of the Federal Aircraft Noise Abatement Program,”
in response to President Johnson’s direction in Mar. 2, 1966, Transportation Message, covered initiation of ten-point action program aimed at alleviating jet aircraft noise in vicinity of airports. Report showed participating agencies to include OST, faa, nasa, hud, and Dept, of Commerce. Meeting program objectives would require continuing program of research performed in-house and by contractors, several projects being reported as underway.
NASA and FAA jointly pursued investigations on: noise measuring methods and techniques; sociological noise assessment; noise level and duration criteria; LeRC Quiet Engine project effects of blade characteristics on compressor noise levels; compressor noise suppression and absorption; scale model studies in support of compressor acoustics investigations ; landing approach and climb-out procedures; and implication of introduction of Boeing 747 and sst (and others) on aggravation of aircraft noise problem.
HUD and faa jointly studied: delineation of aircraft noise exposure and land use values in vicinity of major international airports; relative economic and social costs and benefits through application of noise reduction and land-use modification; stimulation of airport community development in directions which would anticipate or ameliorate community aircraft noise problems; noise alleviation through insulation of houses; and compatible land use.
In relating U.S. and international efforts in the broad field of aircraft noise abatement, the U.S. would have to proceed with a sense of urgency to develop its national standards to the point where they could be proposed for international adoption. The forum in which such standards must ultimately be agreed upon was the International Civil Aviation Organization (icao).
In the field of legislating proper control of aircraft noise, both 89th and 90th Congresses had received “aircraft noise” bills from the Administration, empowering Secretary of Transportation “. . . to promulgate noise standards and to exercise all of the regulatory and certification authority ... on the basis of such noise standards.” (Text; NASA SP-4007, 80; Hudson, NYT, 4/9/67, 1)

•	Entire universe might be immersed in a sea of tiny particles known as
neutrinos whose presence had thus far eluded observation, Dr. William A. Fowler of Cal Tech told American Physical Society meeting in New York. His theory sought to explain absence of helium in the spectra of certain older stars within the framework of the “big bang” theory of the universe. If -the exploding fireball from which the universe was formed had been packed with neutrinos, these particles would have interacted with neutrons to produce a cloud of protons and electrons, Dr. Fowler said. Latter would then have combined to form hydrogen atoms which
would have stringently limited amount of helium formed. “Neutrino astronomy is just getting started,” he said, “but it might ultimately verify or deny presence of the hypothetical neutrino sea.” (Sullivan, NYT, 2/2/67,25)

February 3—4: Mars symposium sponsored by NASA Institute for Space Studies, Yeshiva Univ., and New York Univ. was held in New York. Discoveries reported at meeting were later summarized by Walter Sullivan in New York Times: (1) Martian surface, although free of water-carved valleys, is so heavily eroded that wind alone cannot account for it. It is possible that ground is soaked with liquid water even though air of Mars is too thin and dry to produce rain; (2) new observations seem to confirm that air of Mars contains methane or methane-based gases, presence of which is difficult to explain unless they are generated by living organisms; and (3) evidence that carbon dioxide is predominant component of Martian atmosphere implies that oxygen is being continuously injected into air. Most likely source of oxygen is plant life
performing photosynthesis. Sullivan concluded: “Despite the perceptible swing of the pendulum toward the possibility of life on Mars, a wide disparity of views on the nature of the Martian environment was presented at the meeting. It was evident that the information is still insufficient to assess the likelihood of life on Mars or even to design experiments for landings there that would most effectively test for the existence of life. . . .” (Sullivan, NYT, 2/12/67, 12E)
February 4: NASA’s Lunar Orbiter III (Lunar Orbiter C) unmanned spacecraft was successfully launched by Atlas-Agena D booster from etr in mission to photograph possible lunar landing sites for Apollo astronauts (see Feb. 8-28).
Agena 2nd stage fired to boost 850-lb spacecraft into 100-mi (161km) altitude parking orbit, reignited after 15-min coast period, injecting spacecraft on 92-hr translunar trajectory, and separated. On schedule Lunar Orbiter III deployed its four solar panels and two antennas, locked its five solar sensors on the sun, and fixed its star-tracker on Canopus.
Primary objectives of NASA’s Lunar Orbiter III mission, third in series of five, were (1) to place three-axis stabilized spacecraft into lunar orbit; (2) to obtain high-resolution pictures of previously photographed lunar surface areas to confirm their suitability as landing sites for Apollo and Surveyor spacecraft; and (3) to improve knowledge of the moon. Photos would cover 12 primary target sites located within the Apollo zone of interest on the moon’s front face. Spacecraft would also monitor micrometeoroids and radiation intensity in the lunar environment, refine definition of moon’s gravitational field, and serve as a target for tracking operations by Manned Space Flight Network stations.

•	Charges that haste to meet 1970 deadline to land first man on the moon
had contributed to Jan. 27 Apollo tragedy were completely “unfounded,” Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, told closed hearing of Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences in testimony released Feb. 11. “. . . the Apollo program is . . . the longest R.&D. program that we have undertaken in this Nation. ... It has been paced at a deliberate pace so that it would in fact reasonably economically, but certainly safely, arrive at a set of equipment capable of carrying out the mission. . . .” Dr. Charles A. Berry, msc Director of Medical Research and Operations, said that a total of 20,756 hrs had been accumulated testing the use of 100% oxygen in NASA-sponsored spacecraft and spacesuit evaluation programs. Before Jan. 27 accident, three fires had occurred in pure-oxygen ground simulators: in all cases fires had been traced to electrical systems not used in spacecraft and crew members had recovered from burns. NASA witnesses recounted long history of precautions to avoid spacecraft fires, including insulation, circuit design and circuit protection for electrical wires, and fire-testing of over 400 materials. NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., suggested that exact source of ignition might never be pinpointed: “It is therefore possible that we may fly the Apollo without having been able to establish the cause of the fire. Even in that case, I believe that the care and skill with which the board and program office are conducting their investigations and review will provide the necessary assurance that such an accident cannot be repeated. . . .” (Testimony)

February 8-28: NASA’s Lunar Orbiter III, launched from etr Feb. 4, became third U.S. spacecraft to enter lunar orbit; four days later it was successfully transferred to final close-in orbit for photography. Orbital parameters: apolune, 1,145 mi (1,847 km); perilune, 34 mi (55 km); inclination, 20.93°; and period, 3 hrs 29 min. Spacecraft performed 357 attitude changes, responded to 2,866 commands, and recorded no micrometeoroid hits. A total of 211 medium- and high-resolution photos were taken before mission’s photo acquisition phase was terminated Feb. 24 because of a malfunction in the priority readout system.

• Time magazine considered the question “Why Should Man Go To The
Moon?” and concluded: “The moon itself may not be a particularly valuable piece of real estate.

And there is no doubt that man is going to make the trip some day. . . .
“The moon is a challenge that the U.S. has already taken, a milestone that U.S. astronauts are already looking beyond. . . . The real object is for the U.S. to develop the capability of voyaging confidently to the limits of man’s imagination and ingenuity. The value of such voyages will always be unpredictable. But the history of the human race, said famed . Norwegian Explorer Fridtjof Nansen, ‘is a continual struggle from darkness toward light.

interim report to NASA Administrator James E. Webb on Apollo 204
Review Board investigation of Jan. 27 flash fire in which three Apollo I astronauts died. Board had established 21 panels to conduct inquiry, and Dr. Seamans said he was satisfied that the procedures they were following were “well worked out. When this work is completed, it will give us as clear a view as can be obtained from the evidence.”
Source of ignition had not yet been determined, but physical evidence thus far examined indicated fire had had considerable variation and density and might have had more than one phase. “One hypothesis, supported by the cabin pressure history, assumes a small, low-grade fire whose heat was at first largely absorbed by the spacecraft structure and that was burning at the time of the first crew report; that fire may have continued for as long as ten seconds. A more intense fire may have then developed, causing the rapid increase in cabin pressure. This fire was probably then extinguished by the depletion of oxygen.” Additional information on accident had been identified and was being analyzed. It was now clear that all three spacesuits had been burned through, Astronaut Grissom’s receiving the most exposure and Astronaut Chaffee’s, the least. Dr. Seamans said disassembly of spacecraft was proceeding with great care, and spacecraft was expected to be removed to industrial area at ksc by Feb. 17. He concluded: “It is important to note that no single spacecraft element is touched or removed for analysis without full Board approval and evaluation of its possible effect on any of the other on-going studies or analyses.” (nasa Release 67-28)

It was just five years ago today that John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth in his Mercury spacecraft, Friendship 7. Since that time, we have made noteworthy strides in the manned exploration of space. ... In the Mercury and the Gemini Programs, we learned much about man’s capabilities in space flight. . . .
“We will learn much more from the Apollo missions. By 1970, we
will have provided the capability to explore space out to 250,000 miles from earth and to conduct manned operations and experiments on flights of up to two weeks duration. The Saturn I and Saturn V boosters will have injected up to 140 tons of payload per launch into near-earth orbit. The Saturn V will have sent 48 tons to the vicinity of the moon. The Apollo spacecraft will have sustained a three-man crew for two weeks in a two-compartment, maneuverable vehicle and will have landed two men on the moon and returned them with samples of lunar material, to earth. The U.S. manned space flight programs will have logged more than 500 man days in space, during which data and experience will have been acquired from approximately 100 in-flight experiments.” (Text)

Our experience with pure oxygen atmosphere included not only the successful Mercury and Gemini flights but a number of instances where a clearly positive source of ignition did not result in a fire. . . .” (2) Apollo spacecraft had been equipped with such items as Velcro adhesive pads to hold frequently used equipment and nylon netting to catch dropped objects. “While most of these [items] were constructed of low-combustion-potential material, they were not arranged as to provide barriers to the spread of a fire. Tests conducted . . . since the accident have shown that an oxygen fire in the capsule will spread along the surface of Velcro and along the edges of nylon netting much faster than through the material itself. (3) Soldered joints in piping carrying both oxygen and fluids were melted away, with resultant leakage contributing to the spread of the fire. . . .” (4) Capsule burst in such a way that flames traveled over and around astronauts’ couches toward rupture. “Under these conditions, and with just a few seconds of time available, the astronauts could not reach the hatch and open it. (5) This fire indicates that a number of items related to the design and performance of the environmental control unit will require the most careful examination and may require redesign. . . .” Webb announced that Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences would hold open hearing on Review Board’s preliminary findings Feb. 27 and that House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on nasa Oversight would conduct full investigation of accident after completion of Board’s inquiry, expected by late March.
Dr. Seamans said in his report that an “electrical malfunction” was regarded as “most likely source of ignition” of the fire but the “possibility exists that no single source will ever be pinpointed.” Board was still considering chemical reactions in onboard materials, spontaneous combustion of certain materials, and possible electrical phenomena. Evidence indicated fire had had three distinct phases: originating in left side of spacecraft, it had burned several seconds unnoticed, then spread becoming more intense and causing cabin pressure to rise rapidly as atmosphere became heated. Fifteen seconds after crew first reported fire, cabin ruptured. During second phase, gases and flames flowed past astronauts’ couches and through hole moving from left to right. With cabin’s oxygen quickly reduced by rush of flames and gas outside, fire continued as localized flame, smoking heavily, in third phase. Dr. Seamans said Board noted: “The experience in flight and in tests prior to the accident had suggested that the probability of a spacecraft fire was low. Continued alertness to the possibility of fire had become dulled by previous ground experience and six years of successful manned missions. . . . Potential ignition sources inside the spacecraft had been treated so as to be considered safe; neither the crews nor the test and development personnel felt the risk of spacecraft fire to be high. . . .” Dr. Seamans emphasized that Board did not recommend changing pure oxygen system or planned cabin pressure for space flight, but did urge that “trade-offs between one- and two-gas atmospheres be re-evaluated . . . [and] pressurized oxygen no longer be used in prelaunch operations.” It also recommended: (1) combustible materials be replaced where possible with nonflammable materials; (2) nonmetallic materials be arranged to maintain fire breaks; (3) systems for oxygen and liquid combustibles be made fire resistant; (4) full flammabmty tests be conducted with mockup of new configuration; (5) more rapidly and easily operated hatch be installed; and (6) on-the-pad emergency procedures be revised to recognize possibility of cabin fire.

•	NASA’s previous approach to preventing spacecraft fires by “preventing their
ignition” had been inadequate, Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, testified at open hearing held by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences on Jan. 27 Apollo tragedy. Also present were NASA Administrator James E. Webb, nasa Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., and Dr. Charles A. Berry, msc Director of Medical Research and Operations. NASA’s future approach would seek to: (1) minimize possibility of ignition, recognizing “that this possibility will always exist”; (2) limit chance of fire’s propagating once it has started; and (3) minimize consequences of fire to crew. Dr. Mueller outlined an extensive program of testing, redesign, and procedural changes, which included escape hatch for Apollo spacecraft that could be opened in two seconds; search for new, less flammable materials for cabin interior and spacesuits; and revised emergency procedures. All improvements and changes would be incorporated into an advanced version—Block II—of Apollo spacecraft. No more Block I spacecraft like Apollo 204 would be used for manned space flights. Dr. Mueller said no estimate of fire’s eventual cost in time or money would be made until completion of Apollo 204 Review Board’s investigation, but he indicated that it would be at least 8 to 10 months before next manned Apollo flight. Dr. Mueller testified that launch rehearsal during which fire had occurred had not been classified as “hazardous” because seven years of experience with Mercury and Gemini programs had never indicated such tests were particularly dangerous. Even if the test had been categorized as hazardous., he said, it would have still taken 90 sec for crew to open the double hatch and complete
their egress. Crew died within 20 sec after detection of fire. Webb added that the handle for equalizing pressure, necessary precondition to opening hatch, had not been actuated. Dr. Berry said carbon monoxide had asphyxiated astronauts. He confirmed that bodies had had “some thermal bums of second and third degree” but “not of sufficient magnitude to cause death.” Dr. Berry warned that “we are never going to be able to completely eliminate the risk of fire as long as oxygen is available.” Dr. Mueller said “an atmosphere which will support life will also support combustion. Therefore the first answer . . . must be fire prevention in terms of strict control of both potential ignition sources and combustible materials.” During the questioning session, Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.) inquired about a 1965 report by Apollo Program Manager m/g Samuel Phillips (usaf). Dr. Mueller said that he did “not recall such a report,” and when asked to supply a copy, Webb said NASA would try and identify the specific report and would make it available to the Comptroller General “under any request that the Committee . .. would make to him.” (Testimony; Transcript, 3-4, 24, 41-2, 61, 70, Apollo Accident, Part 2, 65-66, 75, 86, 97, 108, 115, 125 ff., and 130 ff.)

I am recommending that . . . [U.S.] move ahead with the development of a nuclear engine having a potential of 200,000 to 250,000 pounds of thrust.
“Such an engine could be used for a new and much more powerful third stage for our Saturn V launch vehicle. Because of its high efficiency, it could: [1] permit us almost to double the weight of the present payload of the Saturn V vehicle, [2] increase our ability to maneuver spacecraft, and [3] be used in future manned landings and explorations of far distant planets. . . .” (PD, 3/6/67, 334-5)
•	President Johnson’s FY 1968 budget recommendations marked “a turning
point in the Nation’s space program,” nasa Administrator James E. Webb testified before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Webb said President Johnson had “placed before the Congress a program which says that this Nation must go forward in space and not call it quits at the end of this decade.” He summarized recommendations for
(1) completion of Apollo program; (2) development of capabilities for long-duration manned space flight in Apollo Applications (aa) program; (3) development of “practical applications of our space know-how” using capabilities of AA program and “advanced unmanned systems like the ats-4”; (4) planetary exploration through Voyager program; (5) development of Nerva II nuclear rocket engine; and
(6)	increase in aeronautical research efforts to deal with “emerging problems of civil as well as military aviation” [see Jan. 25].
Webb announced that NASA had established Voyager program management responsibilities “designed to make the best possible utilization of the proved capabilities” of JPL “and of our field centers and laboratories.” Voyager program, since 1964 under NASA Hq. Division of Lunar and Planetary Programs, would become a separate division in OSSA with Oran W. Nicks as Director and Donald P. Hearth, Deputy Director. JPL would be responsible for surface laboratory, tracking, and mission operations systems; msfc, for orbiting spacecraft and Saturn V launch vehicle systems; and LaRC, for landing capsule bus system.
Discussing the NASA program, Webb said: “I should be very clear on the subject of risks. In moving ahead to utilize the resources made available to us, we have had to take technical risks in the development of our equipment and in establishing our schedules. These have included risks that a particular design or line of development would not succeed in meeting the specifications; risks that schedules might not be met; and that we could not recover from a serious setback because we did not have parallel or back-up developments. But we have not knowingly accepted a higher level of risks in order to meet our manned flight schedules. In our specifications, trade-off studies, test criteria, or mission plans, we have taken no risks to the lives or safety of the astronauts that we could find a way to avoid.”
Webb urged that decisions on Voyager and aa programs and on Nerva II be made this year to avoid acceleration of the “dispersal of the know-how that we have built up in government, industry, and universities that has already begun___”
Questioned by Rep. James G. Fulton (R-Pa.) on whether U.S. or U.S.S.R. led in space technology, Webb replied that U.S.S.R. would be ahead in large spacecraft until “we get the nerva as a third stage for the Saturn V which will roughly double the capability of the Saturn V for Earth-escape missions.” While U.S.S.R. may lead in planetary exploration, he said, U.S. was superior in “the very sophisticated use of microminiaturization and many new techniques of handling data.” (Testimony; Transcript, 14-15, 28-9, 34; NASA Release 67-40; NYT, 3/1/67, 29)

of an experiment, conducting an exploratory survey, probing for early discoveries, and in general providing an inexpensive means to lay the groundwork for more expensive satellite and space probe experiments to follow.” Important uses for sounding rockets included: detection of x-ray sources; generation of artificial plasma clouds in space; solar observations; investigation of eclipses; study of atmospheric and ionospheric phenomena; and collection of micrometeoroids. Dr. Newell concluded: “We at NASA regard the sounding rocket program as a vital part of our total national space effort. It will continue to receive our strong support.” (Text)

During February: Space flights lasting one month or more should pose no new respiratory problems for astronauts, but additional research was necessary to ensure against respiratory problems that could arise from prolonged weightlessness and an artificial environment, nrc Space Science Board study concluded. Only serious effects of weightlessness on respiratory system anticipated were possibility that astronauts might inhale dust and other solid particles floating in the spacecraft and that muscles controlling the lungs might weaken because work was easier in weightless environment. Areas recommended for further study included: toleration limits for carbon dioxide in case spacecraft’s absorption system malfunctioned; problems of infection during long missions; possibility of intentionally filling astronauts’ lungs with a liquid to prevent collapse of blood vessels and tissues during acceleration greater than 15 g; and basic medical training and use of drugs for self-medication by crew during weightlessness. Committee also recommended efforts to improve methods to detect and extinguish spacecraft fires, and suggested that a two-gas system with nitrogen or helium be used until effective methods of fire control in 100% oxygen were developed.

•	Initial reaction by the press to Jan. 27 flash fire in which three Apollo
astronauts died:
Business Week: “After 16 space flights, in which 19 astronauts returned from their missions safely, many had forgotten the inescapable peril of exploration. No previous frontier has ever been crossed without the loss of life; it was not to be expected that space—the most perilous frontier of them all—could be conquered without sacrifice. None of this lessens the grief that every man in NASA feels for fallen comrades. But it is the nature of test pilots ... to accept disaster not as defeat but as a call for intensified effort and dedication.” (Bus Wk, 2/4/67)
Washington Evening Star: “Now that the initial shock ... is beginning to wear off, the second guessers are . . . wondering whether we should be going to the moon at all. . . . From any rational point of view, the only thing to do is to carry on. The Apollo program necessarily will mark time until the true cause of the spacecraft disaster is located and corrected. It is conceivable that the delay could cause the Dec. 31, 1969, deadline to be missed. It is entirely possible that the Russians may get to the moon ahead of us. But so what? The world will not end nor the United States vanish, if the Russians beat us to the moon. ... It would be senseless to stop now. Fortunately, it probably would also be impossible.” (Hines, WStar, 2/2/67)
Editor & Publisher:	“The recent disaster at Cape Kennedy indi-
cates we are no less reluctant to face up to disaster than anyone else. Not only were our reporters not prepared for it-—none of them were there for the simulated flight test—but neither were our space officials . . . [because] the full import of the tragedy was fed out piecemeal. . . . The lessons for NASA officials and for newsmen are obvious. Space travel is fraught with dangers in every test, every maneuver, every piece of equipment, but we became complacent about them because of our successes. NASA’s record of dealing with the press up to now has been pretty good and if it hasn’t already developed a ‘disaster plan’ for such accidents it soon will. News media have learned that nothing in the space program should be considered ‘routine’ and that front row seat should never be left unoccupied at any time.” (Editor & Publisher, 2/11/67)
Some press reaction to the accident later became increasingly critical of NASA:
Washington Evening Star: “The implication of the NASA story was that no fire extinguishing apparatus or quick escape mechanism— neither of which was present on the Apollo 1—could have saved the men. The implication of the truth is that if the spacecraft had been equipped with a means of blowing open the hatch, Grissom, White and Chaffee might have had a chance. NASA’s motive in attempting to distort the truth may have been to protect the families of the astronauts from undue mental anguish. But it also served the function of protecting NASA by heading off criticism of the agency ... by deliberately misleading the press, Congress and the public.” (W Star, 2/9/67)
New York Times: “The most basic issue ... is not, as NASA has tended to emphasize, the source of the spark that started the fire. It is rather the question of why so much was permitted to hinge on the assumption that there would be no fire. . . .
“The answer is only secondarily, as a NASA official has suggested, that ‘alertness . . . had become dulled’ by previous successes. . . . More fundamental was the willingness to gamble for the sake of winning the race to the moon.” (NYT, 2/28/67,34)

•	nasa Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., testified in sup-
port of nasa’s FY 1968 budget authorization before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. He reviewed 1966 accomplishments and discussed future space-flight activities: “We completed 22 missions during 1966 successfully out of 29 attempts, or a 76% success. This record is somewhat lower than the previous year, but it is marked by qualitative advances greater than any before.
“The FY 1968 request represents the first true post-Apollo decisions. ... The combination of the 1971 Mariner flights and the initiation of a continuing, major Voyager program” represented effective translations into action of President’s Science Advisory Committee’s recommendation that planetary exploration be given a high priority in the post-Apollo period. “During FY 1968 we will be decreasing somewhat our application of manpower effort on the manned space flight programs with a considerable shift in effort from the Apollo to the Apollo Applications part of that activity. We will be increasing our total effort in space science and applications programs, particularly in the build-up of the Voyager program activity . . . [and devoting] more effort to our advanced research and technology activities. . . .”
Emphasizing that he was “not prepared nor willing to state that a
manned lunar landing cannot be achieved before 1970,” Dr. Seamans admitted there was a high probability that Apollo program would have to operate on a delayed schedule. “An important contributor to . . . success will be adequate resources and the flexibility to apply them when needed. . . . We cannot say today that the $2.6 billion requested for Apollo is not enough [but] we can say it is not too much. ... It cannot be reduced and still accomplish the objectives we have defined.” (Testimony; Transcript, 118)

Manned flights to Mars and Venus and unmanned missions to even more distant planets could be a reality 15 years hence.” Although U.S. had not adopted a manned planetary landing program, Hines explained another advantage of a
nuclear rocket—it could be used for continued exploration of the moon after first Apollo landings. “Using a non-nuclear Saturn 5, astronauts are restricted to landing areas in a narrow strip along the moon’s equator. A nuclear upper stage would permit a manned spacecraft to land anywhere on the surface of the moon.” Other possible uses included manned flyby missions to Mars and Venus; unmanned flights of large payloads to Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury, or within a few million miles of sun; and manned orbital flights to Mars and Venus.

Orbital parameters: apogee, 354 mi (570 km); perigee, 336 mi (540 km); period, 96 min; and inclination, 33°. Third of eight spacecraft in NASA’s oso program to provide direct observation of the sun, Oso III weighed 627 lbs, carried nine experiments, and had two main sections: the wheel (lower) section provided stability by gyroscopic spinning and housed the telemetry-command equipment, batteries, electronic controls, gas spin-control arms, and seven experiment packages; the sail (upper) section was oriented toward the sun and contained solar cells and two solar pointing experiments.
Primary purpose of Oso III was to obtain high-resolution spectral data in the range 8A-1300A from pointed solar experiments during major portion of one solar rotation and adequate operational support of spacecraft subsystems to carry out acquisition of these scientific data. Spacecraft’s experiments were designed to continue and extend work of Oso I (launched March 7, 1963) and Oso II (launched Feb. 3, 1965) spacecraft by collecting data on solar x-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet radiation, and other solar activity.

importance of space science in testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. “The space research effort has been abundantly fruitful in answering first and second generation questions about our space environment, and in turning up a whole new generation of fundamental and important questions, and potentially fruitful practical applications. To answer these new questions, and to continue advancing in this important field, it is time to select new missions to replace old ones.”
Past OSSA successes and proposed 1968 program were outlined by Cortright: “During the past two years (1965 and 1966) 23 of the 28 OSSA missions were successful, including 7 out of 8 deep space missions to the Moon and into interplanetary space. In addition, we successfully launched 6 out of 6 payloads for other organizations. Further, the Atlas Centaur development program was successfully completed and Centaur was used to launch Surveyors I and II. The 1966 series of dramatic successes with second and third generation automated spacecraft demonstrated striking advances in the utility, durability, versatility, and effectiveness of this equipment.”
The 1968 program—including Voyager, Mariner Mars ’71, Sunblazer, Nimbus (E and F), ATS, and Voice Broadcast Satellite—had been carefully planned to meet U.S.’s most urgent minimum future needs, Cortright stressed. “. . . this is a critical year in the development of our Country’s program to explore space and to apply space technology to the benefit of man. . . . Those new missions which we have selected to pursue . . . constitute the most important of a long list of exciting opportunities for' space exploration and practical application.” (Testimony; Transcript)

Assembly concluded: “No present or immediate economic gains are apparent that are worth the political costs. We recommend that implementation of this program be stopped and not resumed unless its economic value is proven and suitable international controls agreed to.” (McElheny, W Post, 3/13/67, A8)
March 14: Lunar Orbiter III photos of Surveyor I resting on the moon— first pictures ever taken of an identifiable outline of a man-made object that had been landed on the moon—were released by NASA. Photos were taken Feb. 22 at 30-mi altitude from slant range of 82 mi. (Marshall Star, 3/31/67,2)
•	NASA Aerobee 150A sounding rocket launched from NASA Wallops Station
carried 190-lb payload with AFCRL solar radiation experiment to 128-mi (206-km) altitude and impacted 60 mi downrange in the Atlantic. Protective nose cone was ejected during ascent, but payload did not separate from rocket. NASA later reported that desired results were not fully achieved because of partial failure in the spectrometer.
Prime mission objective was simultaneous measurement of solar extreme ultraviolet radiation (euv) in upper atmosphere with Aerobee’s photoelectric spectrometer and similar instrument on NASA’s Oso III Orbiting Solar Observatory, launched from ETR March 8. Data from two would be correlated to verify satisfactory operation of Oso IIPs instrument. Secondary experiment on Aerobee 150A involved measurements of ion and electron concentrations and changes in radiation along rocket’s trajectory, (nasa Release 67—56; WS Release 67—7)

•	Dr. Mac C. Adams, NASA Associate Administrator for Advanced Re-
search and Technology, and his Deputy Dr. Alfred J. Eggers testified on NASA FY 1968 authorization bill before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology. U.S. space program was entering a period when NASA would . utilize existing capabilities, Dr. Adams said, and it was therefore particularly important for oart to “emphasize new technology so that new systems will be available for the next major thrust in aeronautics and space.” He mentioned highlights of the program to develop new technology: (1) Nerva nuclear rocket engine; (2) experimental research related to hypersonic propulsion; (3) advanced cryogenic engine; (4) improved life-support systems; and (5) increased effort in electronics problems because “electronics systems may well be the limiting factor in our future exploration.”
Dr. Eggers noted that r&d budget request in aeronautics for FY 1968 nearly doubled that for 1967 and said the expansion reflected “recognition of the rapidly growing importance of air transportation and the need for increased r&d to provide required advances in the associated technology. Aeronautics is already the order of a $24 billion a year industry and it is netting the nation better than $1 billion per annum in favorable balance of payments. Accordingly, our proposed major strengthening of aeronautics r&d will be to the great commercial as well as military benefit of the nation in the future.” (Transcript, 8, 13; Testimony)

March 14-15: aas-nsc Fifth Goddard Memorial Symposium, “The Voyage to the Planets,” was held in Washington, D.C.
Arthur C. Clarke, author and past president of British Interplanetary Society, chided critics of space program expenditures because “ ‘there is so much to do on earth.’ . . . There was plenty to do in Europe when Columbus left—there’s still plenty to do there. But the opening up of the new world did more to revive the stagnant European culture and economy than an internal action could possibly have done.

The most difficult scientific task vas developing an effective integrated set of biological experiments. (Text)
Exploration of the planets would contribute to, not detract from, man’s ability to meet problems on earth, Dr. Charles Sheldon II, Library of Congress, suggested. “Also one has the right to hope that even if elements of past history repeat in new forms, mankind with a shrinking world and shrinking solar system, and with a greater awareness of his place within the scheme of things will divert his restless energies and struggles to overcoming the space frontiers rather than wasting his talents and his treasures in fratricidal war. . . .” (Text)
U.S. had achieved world leadership in the technology of space exploration, but that leadership was relative and by no means conclusive, Rep. George P. Miller (D-Calif.) asserted. “The challenge is no less great now than it was in 1957 when Sputnik I jolted us out of the narcosis of complacency. To our peril, we cannot allow the transient pressures and strains of American life to vitiate our determination to maintain that leadership. At the same time we cannot ignore or overlook any opportunity to reach a rapport and an understanding with Russia that will be of material assistance in making the exploration of space for peaceful purposes truly a monumental achievement of all mankind.” (Text) March 15: NASA and West Germany’s Federal Ministry for Scientific Research (bmwf) signed Memorandum of Understanding for study of electric fields in the upper atmosphere. NASA would furnish five Nike-Apache sounding rockets for launch from esro facilities at Kiruna, Sweden, beginning in April. Rockets would release barium clouds, particularly in the auroras, to be observed from the ground, bmwf would provide chemical payloads and ground observation equipment and would conduct launchings in cooperation with esro and Swedish Space Research Committee (ssrc) . Both NASA and bmwf would bear cost of their respective responsibilities. Results would be made available to world scientific community, (nasa Release 67-57)

•	nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr.
Homer E. Newell, testifying before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications, said the scientific community saw a need to develop a spacecraft to make measurements at low altitudes—about 80 mi—to investigate transition between the meteorology of the lower atmosphere and the aeronomy of the upper. In the lower atmosphere the constituents are thoroughly mixed; in the upper, they tend to separate by gravity with the heaviest below and the lightest above. “The importance of this transition region has been revealed by the [sounding] rocket program, but only satellites can provide the global measurements needed to establish the lower boundary conditions for the upper atmosphere as a whole,” Newell said. “Such a mission would require the development of a spacecraft with a restartable engine in order to achieve an adequate lifetime.” (Testimony)

•	Milton B. Ames, Jr., Director of Space Vehicles, and Dr. Walton L. Jones,
Director of Biotechnology and Human Research Div., NASA Office of Advance Research and Technology, testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology. Ames said land recovery of manned spacecraft was one of OART’s major objectives; NASA had enlarged research plans substantially to acquire “without delay” the detailed technology necessary to “permit the confident application of steerable flexible-winged parachutes to the recovery of manned spacecraft.” Earliest major potential application would probably be to Apollo, to provide for land recovery in post-lunar-landing period of the early 1970’s. “Such a capability would greatly extend the operational flexibility and utility of the Apollo system and . . . contribute to the feasibility of refurbishment and reuse.”
Dr. Jones said increased possibility of aspiration of particulate matter had been identified by nrc Space Science Board as a potentially serious effect of prolonged weightlessness. “In zero gravity conditions, dust particles do not settle out. This could lead to deposits in the respiratory tract which could have important implications in the production of pulmonary disease.” Jones said a new instrument to measure and record the number and size of dust particles in a spacecraft was scheduled for an Apollo flight.

Asserting that U.S.S.R. was “far ahead” of U.S. in a critical area of nuclear knowledge, afa called for a “sweeping re-examination of national strategy” to assess the impact of technology “on the world balance of power.” In a specific resolution, afa urged a full-scale U.S. SST program, claiming that U.S.S.R. had been secretly flying a supersonic aircraft prototype for “more than one year.” (Davies, NYT, 3/16/67,10; WPost, 3/17/67, A4)
Dr. Harold Agnew, Weapons Div. Leader at aec’s Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, said U.S. reluctance to deploy an antiballistic missile system reflected a new balance-of-power concept which was characterized by weapons judged on their contributions to world stability rather than their superiority. This philosophy was dangerous because it stifled innovation and placed the Nation continually on the defensive. “Whether we use our full technological advantage should be determined solely on whether it is to our advantage politically, militarily and economically as far as our adversary is concerned. I believe it has been a mistake to allow the fleeting opinions of every nation that has a vote in the U.N. to influence materially our actions. The inhibition of the use of our full technological advantage has hurt our technological future as well as prolonging whatever confrontation is at hand. The basis of advanced technology is innovation, and nothing is more stifling to innovation than seeing one’s product not used or ruled out of consideration on flimsy premises involving public or world opinion. . . .” (Av Wk, 3/27/67,

•110 scientists from U.S. and six other countries were selected by NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr. Homer E. Newell—upon recommendation of Space Science Steering Committee—to conduct experiments with first lunar samples returned by U.S. Apollo astronauts. Principal U.S. investigators represented 21 universities, two industrial firms, three private institutions, and 10 Government laboratories. Nine scientific institutions were represented in U.K.; three in West Germany; and one each in Canada, Japan, Finland, and Switzerland. Most investigations would be conducted in scientists’ own laboratories, but time-critical experiments would be carried out in msc’s Lunar Receiving Laboratory during quarantine period—anticipated to last 30 days. Plans called for a total of 122 experiments on approximately 50 lbs of lunar material to study composition of lunar surface and search for evidence of its origin.

•	Francis J. Sullivan and Dr. Hermann H. Kurzweg of nasa Office of Ad-
vanced Research and Technology testified before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Advanced Research and Technology. Sullivan, Director of Electronics and Control Div., said that the development of technology for high-resolution, 60- to 120-in space telescopes for optical astronomy, communications, and other potential applications was a major OART effort. “Success in this research will provide the capability to study celestial objects which cannot be viewed from the ground because of atmospheric attenuation and will provide vastly improved resolution over that attainable through the earth’s atmosphere.”
Sullivan said because environmental, structural, and control problems of large mirrors in space were almost insurmountable with conventional fabrication and alignment, unique approaches were being studied. One was 24-in-dia, three-segment mirror feasibility model in which distortion sensor, located in front of primary mirror, determined which segments were out of alignment and to what degree. Electronic circuitry then processed and used the alignment data to realign mirror surface segments with actuators located behind each segment.
Dr. Kurzweg, Director of Research, said the jpl had developed a new mathematical approach for calculating energy requirements for
Mars vehicles which provided, for the first time, a complete day-hy-day listing of the energies necessary for a round trip. Calculations had been completed for launching during the entire 1970-80 decade. “The calculated trajectories went from a circular parking orbit about the Earth to the vicinity of Mars, into a circular parking orbit about Mars for a stay time of 7 days, out of the circular parking orbit about Mars to the vicinity of the Earth, and into a circular parking orbit about the Earth. It was assumed that the one-way flight times for both the departure and return trajectories are the same.” Dr. Kurzweg said information was very important for “fast trade-off calculations for future advanced Mars missions. . . .” (Testimony)

Report did not fully discuss the comparative value of space and nonspace activities and “quickly ducked” the difficult problem of priorities, Dr. Abelson said. Nowhere was there an evaluation of the chances of finding extraterrestrial life. “Another deficiency is the lack of a full discussion of the role of man in deep space exploration. To date, manned missions have contributed little scientifically. The unmanned missions have had a cost effectiveness for scientific achievement perhaps 100 times that of the manned flights.

Mueller, in testimony before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight, presented profile of a typical manned Mars mission. “We would launch as we approach the target planet, a series of [unmanned] probes, one would be an orbiter, another would be a Mars surface sample return probe.
“There would also be some Lander probes which would provide us with information about the atmosphere and the surface on a continuing basis. All of this would be done in a matter of a few days while one was in the vicinity of the planet.
“We would also be carrying out observations of the local environment and conducting an extensive solar observation program and a planetary observation program from various vantage points one attains from an orbit that is far removed from earth.” Asked about the alternative of launching an instrumented spacecraft into a long elliptical orbit with two focal points—the earth and Mars—and manning it from earth, Dr. Mueller replied: “The maj or problem associated with that is that we are talking about a . . . telescope at least forty inches in diameter. It is a quite difficult task and we are reaching a level of complexity when man becomes an essential part of the system. . . .” (Transcript, 180-1)

Responding to criticism by Committee Chairman Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.) that information from the mission would arrive too late to contribute to the design of the 1973 Voyager spacecraft, Dr. Newell said: “. . . it is very important to recognize . . . that there are three areas of design involved. One is the hardware design. Two is software design, and three is design of the scientific mission. . . . The Mars 71 probe will be fully in time for us to use in the software design, in other words, setting the profile of the mission to get the spacecraft into the atmosphere and onto the surface, and will be fully involved in continuing design of the scientific experiments and observations. . . .” (Transcript, 433-5)

Live transpacific television and other traffic was transmitted by the first of the intelsat n series of satellites even though the satellite did not achieve synchronous orbit as intended. A second intelsat ii satellite was successfully emplaced in synchronous orbit and began regular, 24-hour commercial service over the Pacific, handling telephone, teletype, data, facsimile and television. . . .” Report also revealed that Intelsat’s Interim Committee had selected synchronous orbit configuration for basic global system, substantially reducing the number of satellites necessary for global coverage and the complexity of earth stations. Selection was made “after high-quality capability of synchronous satellites was established by the performance of Early Bird.” (Text)
•	50-lb. radio backpack that could fix a soldier’s position precisely by
signals from a satellite had been developed by Johns Hopkins’ Applied Physics Laboratory under sponsorship of usn Air Systems Command. Backpack would represent first dry land application of usn navigation satellites to military problems. In most cases, packs would be used in pairs: a forward fire controller would receive satellite signal and relay it to another soldier equipped with a backpack at an artillery base who also would have read satellite signal. Two readings would be transmitted to computer which would instantly tell each man his precise position. Navy sources predicted mass production models of backpack, working with existing satellites, could Be in combat use in Vietnam soon. (Clark, AIT, 3/22/67,16)

•	U.S. policies for sterilizing planetary spacecraft were needlessly stringent
and should be revised to take into account new scientific data and past and continuing Soviet activities, two groups of U.S. scientists suggested in companion articles in Science. First, by Drs. N. H. Horowitz and R. P. Sharp of Cal Tech and R. W. Davies of jpl, reviewed sterilization standards set in 1964 by cospar and agreed to by both U.S. and U.S.S.R. “In effect the [cospar] resolution requires that less than one viable microorganism be contained in each 10,000 spacecraft intended for planetary entry. Attainment of such a goal demands heroic measures, and current U.S. directives call for dry-heat sterilization of the completely assembled lander stage.” The authors asserted that cospar requirements were based on the outdated assumption that terrestrial microorganisms could thrive on other planets, particularly Mars; present knowledge, however, indicated that Mars is so dry, lacking in oxygen,
and soaked with lethal forms of ultraviolet sunlight that proliferation of earth organisms would be unlikely. They suggested that cospar-recommended constraints “could be substantially relaxed without compromising to any significant degree the biological condition of Mars.”
Second article, by Dr. Bruce C. Murray, Cal Tech, Merton E. Davies, rand Corp., and Dr. Philip K. Eckman, jpl, said U.S. policy should concentrate on seeing that “U.S. contribution to plantary contamination will remain significantly less than the Soviet contributions” thereby reducing “significantly the cost and time required to carry out serious scientific investigations of the surfaces of Venus and Mars.” The authors suggested that U.S.S.R. had already hit both Mars and Venus with spacecraft not sterilized in accordance with COSPAR standards. Any requirement for U-S. to apply more stringent restrictions “is illogical in that . . . the U.S. would be asked to increase greatly the cost and complexity of its planetary program without achieving any significant reduction in the probability of actual contamination.” (Science, 3/24/67, 1501—10)

March 31: Langley Research Center engineers at jpl, after repeated efforts to reactivate Lunar Orbiter Ill’s photo system which failed March 2, had concluded there was virtually no hope for transmission of further photos from the spacecraft. Analysis of events indicated failure had originated with momentary fluctuation in spacecraft’s electrical power which disturbed photo system logic by turning the film advance motor memory to forward mode. Cause of fluctuation had not been identified. Motor, following incorrect logic, stalled as it attempted to move film which was being mechanically held in a fixed position while readout was in progress. During stalled condition, motor overheated to failure point. Despite termination of photo transmission, Lunar Orbiter III continued to serve as a tracking target, providing practice for nasa Manned Space Flight Network stations, and to record information on radiation and meteoroids in moon’s vicinity, (nasa Release 67-76)

During March: Aerospace praised NASA’s contributions to U.S. aeronautical research: “Since the United States started sending experimental vehicles beyond Earth’s atmosphere nine years ago aeronautical research has been overshadowed by space exploration as far as the annual budgets of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are concerned. . . . But dollar comparisons fail to tell the whole story. For its space work, NASA has had to build from scratch a variety of expensive ground facilities and equipment and to make heavy outlays for complex, nonreusable flight hardware. NASA’s aeronautical teams spend little on flight equipment and what they do buy is reusable; furthermore, they operate from facilities for the most part built and paid for prior to the Space Age. There is no question but that space has played the dominant role in nasa’s programs, but the aeronautical research effort has been far more substantial—and more rewarding—than an examination of budget figures would indicate. In the coming year, assuming Congressional approval of the pending budget, it will be increased.” (Aerospace, 3/67, 3)

by William Hines in series of articles in Washington Evening Star. A 55-page report submitted to nasa three days before Jan. 27 flash fire by Thomas R. Baron, former North American Aviation, Inc., inspector at ksc Apollo warehouse, charged that improper parts had been installed in Apollo I spacecraft. Careless and unorthodox warehousing practices had caused many parts and materials intended for spacecraft use to lose their identity, Baron told Hines in an interview. “As a result there was probably a bundle of stuff [in Apollo] that they don’t have any idea what ... it is at all.” Baron also charged that on at least one occasion, naa had installed a substandard part with deliberate subterfuge, without the knowledge of nasa. Truth about the part could easily be concealed because nasa had no quality-control men of its own in receiving warehouse, Baron said. He was particularly critical of deviation from test procedures: “When you deviate on your small components, and you deviate on all of them, and you put these in one system and you run a systems test and you deviate again, you’ve ended up with a system that really isn’t worthwhile.”
James Parker, former nasa quality control inspector at ksc, told Hines that nasa quality control supervision on Apollo contractors’ work was “spotty” and said he had periodically cited instances of waste and improper expenditures in reports to his ksc superiors.

April 3: Ford Foundation and AT&T submitted briefs to fcc on domestic comsat system.
Ford Foundation brief sharply criticized ComSatCorp’s plan for a domestic comsat system and asked that ComSatCorp’s April 1 request for permission to develop an experimental system be denied. “To add to Comsat’s authority the exclusive francise for a domestic communications satellite system . . . would give the corporation a world monopoly. One entity would provide all communications satellite services. One company would be responsible for developing all satellite technology. One customer would procure all satellite equipment. A monopoly of this sort would be unprecedented. . . .” Ford suggested instead that the system be developed and initially operated by NASA so that technological knowledge could be gleaned without controversy over ultimate management or ownership. NASA could later be reimbursed by the entity finally chosen to operate the system.
at&t supported ComSatCorp’s proposal, suggesting the system be linked to and integrated with present ground systems. Rejecting Ford Foundation’s proposal for a separate nonprofit satellite TV broadcast corporation whose income would support noncommercial TV, at&t said that such proposals reflected “a parochial disregard for their effects on other satellite systems and terrestrial (land) microwave systems. . . . Installation of such limited systems would . . . jeopardize the existing public communications systems, both domestic and overseas, and would severely inhibit their necessary continued growth.” (Text; Gould, NYT, 4/3/67, 1; W Star, 4/4/67)

April 5: NASA’s 815-lb Ats II (ats-a) (Applications Technology Satellite) was launched from ETR by Atlas-Agena D booster on mission to evaluate gravity-gradient system for spacecraft stabilization in 6,900-mi-altitude orbit and to obtain useful data from experiments during first 30 days in orbit. Spacecraft successfully entered elliptical transfer orbit with 6,878-mi (11,069-km) apogee; 120-mi (192.7-km) perigee; 218.3-min period; and 28.4° inclination. Agena engines, which were to have reignited to inject spacecraft into 6,900-mi (11,103-km) -altitude circular orbit, failed to ignite for the second burn; spacecraft separated and, tumbling uncontrollably, remained in transfer orbit.
By April 7, all but one of the scientific experiments had been turned on and operated successfully, but usefulness of data could not be determined because spacecraft’s sensors were not compatible with its orbit. Last experiment was turned on April 15. Although it was apparent that mission could not be successfully completed, scientists continued to operate experiments to obtain as much data as possible on spacecraft performance, and ground stations received occasional TV pictures and meteorological photos. Gravity-gradient configuration functions would not be exercised until spacecraft’s attitude behavior could be better defined.
Ats II was second in series of five satellites designed to improve spacecraft technology; develop long-life control systems; advance spacecraft communications; and improve long-range weather predictions. Record size—252 ft long with 123-ft booms extended from opposite sides— Ats II was first U.S. gravity-gradient satellite to carry meteorological cameras and first with sufficient instrumentation to verify three-axis gravity control system in conjunction with detailed computer program. In addition to gravity-gradient experiment, satellite also carried communications equipment, two Advanced Vidicon Camera System (avcs) cameras, and eight scientific experiments to measure orbital environment. Ats I was successfully launched Dec. 6, 1966, into a 22,300-mi-altitude near-synchronous orbit over the Pacific and was still operating flawlessly, ats program was managed by GSFC under ossa direction.

•	Chairman James McCormack of ComSatCorp, speaking at annual meet-
ing of National Assn, of Broadcasters, in Chicago, made these predictions: “With new satellites, having flexibility to permit working with several earth stations simultaneously and having increased transmission capabilities, and with improved earth stations, we are coming on better days. For a year or so, we will continue to be handicapped by a lack of ground facilities to enable the United States to work efficiently and simultaneously with more than one satellite in either the Atlantic or the Pacific [and] we will continue for a while to be embarrassed by lack of system capacity there, primarily in the earth stations, to handle occasional TV transmissions without buying back other circuits then under annual or monthly lease.” He continued: “. . . in a very few years, you will have the potential of continuous, live,
world-wide TV transmission at well under one percent of your total costs.”
He went on to explain: “Given the geographic coverage of the satellite, capable of being used directly from a number of points' simultaneously, and the rapid growth of all kinds of requirements for service, a single world-wide communications organization was deemed essential from the beginning. The same set of considerations would seem to indicate at least a broadly based international forum for broadcasting, an important and rather unique use of those communications.”
Turning to potential world-wide benefits, he said: “The establishment of a world-wide broadcast capability, in being and operating continuously, will enable the almost casual accomplishment of some of the greatest purposes of the United States and many other nations seeking better understanding as one basis for a reasonable peaceful world. I refer in particular of course to cultural exchanges, information and education.” (Text)

April 6: Lunar Orbiter III press briefing was held at nasa Hq.
Dr. Leonard Reiffel, Apollo Program, omsf, said nasa had selected eight “candidate” locations along the moon’s equator as the smoothest and safest possible sites for first Apollo manned landings. Selection had been made after careful screening of photos taken by three Lunar Orbiters and Surveyor I. Detailed analysis of photos indicated that safest area might be a broad plain in the southeast part of the Sea of Tranquility—just east of Maskelyne D crater—where the surface was flat and there were few dangerous boulders and no deep craters. NASA officials emphasized, however, that no single site would be selected: each mission would have three possible sites along the equator-—one in the east, one in the center, and one in the west—to allow for launch delays.
Harold Masursky, U.S. Geological Survey, described evidence of “seismic erosion” as “one of the major processes on the moon’s surface that Lunar Orbiter has given us information about.” Several photos showed dunes of soil-like material that appeared to be debris from moon-quakes filling old craters. Some of the smoother plains on the moon might be caused in part by this process, Masursky suggested. (Wilford, NYT, 4/7/67, 1, 14)

•	Editorial comment on domestic satellite system controversy [see April 1,3].
New York Times: “The Ford Foundation and Communications Satellite Corporation are at odds about how best to set up a domestic satellite system that would carry educational television. Neither side, it appears, has all the answers. Ford is right to question Comsat’s demand to run a domestic satellite system . . . [but] Ford’s own plan for creating a new educational network is also unsatisfactory. It wants to give the job on a trial basis to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which has enough problems with its present over-ambitious objectives and should not have its energies diverted or its resources increased for anything new. Ford’s suggestion that savings in communications charges made by the commercial networks should be used to finance educational TV has an inherent disadvantage in that the amount of savings would be inadequate to do a worthwhile job. . . . These differences in approach should not be allowed to hold up development of noncommercial network. The thing to do is to choose what is best from both plans.” {NYT, 4/6/67, 36)
Washington Post: “The issue is more than just a squabble over Comsat’s request. The Ford Foundation has proposed that the Nation establish more than one domestic satellite system, with one system reserved exclusively for television, both commercial and public. Comsat maintains that one system can do the entire job of communications adequately and will save large sums of money. . . . Given the complexities of the problem, and the need that it be solved, hand-in-hand with the general question of how public television is to be financed, we think Ford’s alternative is advisable. . . . nasa has the capabilities to do the job and would be involved, anyway, in putting Comsat’s satellite into orbit. This solution would leave all avenues open, for nasa is highly unlikely to become the permanent operator and could recoup its expenditures by selling the equipment and stations to the eventual operator.” (W Post, 4/6/67)

It is apparent that they will have to stay in orbit a long time. It will be necessary to supply them and change crews with the use of simplified types of space vehicles. . . . The time is not far off when longer and more distant space flights will be made.”
In later Novosti press agency report Soviet Academy of Sciences Chairman Anatoly A. Blagonravov supported Gagarin’s predictions and said: “Mankind is entering the 7th year of the age of man’s space flight, and we do not doubt that in the not very distant future we will witness new space victories which will exert a growing influence on the life of people.” (Anderson, NYT, 4/9/67; upi, W Star, 4/9/67, A13; C Trib, 4/10/67)
April 9: Most probable cause of Jan. 27 flash fire in which Astronauts Virgil I. Grissom, Edward H. White II, and Roger B. Chaffee died was a sparking short circuit in worn, defective, or poorly insulated wire, Apollo 204 Review Board concluded in its final report. Copies of report were distributed simultaneously to NASA Administrator James E. Webb, congressional committees, and the press. Board was unable to pinpoint exact ignition source, but identified conditions which led to the disaster: (1) a sealed cabin, pressurized with an oxygen atmosphere; (2) an extensive distribution of combustible materials in the cabin; (3) vulnerable wiring carrying spacecraft power; (4) inadequate provisions for the crew to escape; and (5) inadequate provisions for rescue or medical assistance. Having identified these conditions, the Board addressed itself to the question of “how these conditions came to exist. Careful consideration of this question . . . leads ... to the conclusion that in its devotion to the many difficult problems of space travel, the Apollo team failed to give adequate attention to certain mundane but equally vital questions of crew safety.
“The board’s investigation revealed many deficiencies in design and engineering, manufacture and quality control. When these deficiencies are corrected the over-all reliability of the Apollo program will be increased greatly.”
Board offered a total of 21 recommendations, including: (1) an “indepth” review of the entire Apollo life-support system; (2) an investigation of effective ways to control and extinguish spacecraft fires; (3) severe restriction and control of amount and location of combustible materials inside spacecraft; (4) reduction of time required for crew to egress and simplification of escape operations; (5) continuous monitoring of safety of all test operations to assure adequacy of emergency protections; (6) improved ground communications system; (7) continued studies of two-gas cabin atmosphere; and (8) full-scale mockup tests to establish fire safety of reconfigured command module. Board emphasized that its report was not intended as a criticism of NASA’s entire manned program: “The board is very concerned that its description of the defects in the Apollo program . . .will be interpreted as an indictment of the entire manned space flight program and a castigation of the many people associated with the program. Nothing is further from the board’s mind.” (Text; NYT, 4/10/67, 1, 28-9; W Star, 4/ 10/67, Al, A6-7; W Post, 4/10/67, Al, A8) .

April 10: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, accompanied by Apollo 204 Review Board members, NASA Deputy Administrator Robert C. Seamans, Jr., and NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller, testified on Jan. 27 flash fire before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on NASA Oversight. Webb said the Board had found error, “but it has also found the capability within NASA and the Apollo team of contractors to overcome error.” NASA and industry would share their part of the blame “for what we have done or left undone,” Webb said, but the committee could have confidence that “nasa and its contractors have the capability to overcome every deficiency required to proceed to successfully fly the Apollo Saturn system and accomplish its objectives.” He said Board Chairman Dr. Floyd Thompson had reassured him that the “concepts and the basic design on which the Apollo system is based can be made to work in a reliable manner,” and Astronaut/Board member Frank Borman had reported he would be confident to fly the Apollo spacecraft
if reported deficiencies were eliminated. Webb concluded: “If any man in this room asks for whom the Apollo bell tolls, it tolls for him and me, as well as for Grissom, White and Chaffee.
“It tolls for every astronaut test pilot who will lose his life in the space simulated vacuum of a test chamber or the real vacuum of space . . . for every astronaut scientist who will lose his life on some lonely hill on the moon or Mars . . . for Government and industrial executives and legislators alike . . . for an open program continuously evaluated by the opinion makers with little time for second thought—operating in the brilliant color and brutal glare of real time, worldwide mass media with the speed of the television, from euphoria to exaggerated detail....”
Asked why six of the eight Board members were NASA employees, Webb replied that they were the best qualified people for the investigation and noted that they were all familiar with the spacecraft or with similar types of investigations. He said that in his opinion the Board had “to a large degree . . . overstated the case.” Questioned about charges by the press that many qualified Project Apollo technicians were not called to testify before the Board, Webb responded: “It is easy to make allegations, hard to conduct an investigation, and even harder to make the Apollo Saturn fly at the earliest possible date. I do not believe these allegations are worth your consideration.”
Dr. Thompson discussed methods and procedures followed by the Board, and key Board members traced the process of establishing the course of the fire, the “most probable” ignition source, and detailed findings and recommendations. (Testimony; Transcript 10, 15-8)

My concern is not that the Board was unable to discover the precise cause of the accident during the course of its rigorous technical investigation, but, rather, that the Board failed to examine, or at least report on, the fundamental conditions which permitted the accident to occur and which, moreover, resulted in the tragic deaths of three fine young men.

April 11: Apollo 204 Review Board, accompanied by NASA Administrator James E. Webb, testified before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Key Board members summarized the Board’s findings and recommendations. Astronaut Frank Borman, asked if he believed U.S. decision to use 100% oxygen atmosphere in spacecraft had been influenced by a desire to achieve first manned lunar landing, replied: “. . . never since I have been associated with NASA have I ever experienced any decision where a known detriment to crew safety was sacrificed to any operational requirement. And although I am willing to accept risk ... I am not willing personally to accept undue risk and I would not participate in any decision which I thought was expediting a program in an unsafe manner. And in the final analysis the crew is the Review Board because if we do not like the way the spacecraft is configured, we don’t have to get in.” Borman said if on Jan. 27 he had had the information accumulated by the Board, he would not have entered the Apollo spacecraft because: (1) the test had not been classified as hazardous; (2) the spacecraft contained too many combustibles; (3) the wire that provided the ignition source was vulnerable. Borman said he would be “willing and eager” to enter a 100% oxygen Apollo spacecraft which incorporated Board’s recommended improvements. (Testimony; Transcript, 181, 209—10, 258)
• In testimony before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on NASA Oversight, North American Aviation President J. Leland Atwood denied that pressures to meet 1970 lunar-landing goal had prompted naa engineers to take shortcuts in Apollo program. Terming the Apollo 204 Review Board’s study “a good and penetrating report,” Atwood conceded that deficiencies existed in the Apollo capsule, but disputed Board’s charge that “deficiencies existed in Command Module design, workmanship, and quality control. . . .” naa’s Director of Research and Engineering Dr. John F. McCarthy said that although an electrical arc “probably” caused the fire, there were “various other possibilities”—such as Astronaut Gus Grissom accidentally kicking loose a wire that could have later initiated the blaze. Under stern questioning by subcommittee members, however, Dr. McCarthy admitted that this theory was pure speculation.
In response to charge by Rep. William F. Ryan (D-N.Y.) that prevailing attitude prior to fire was not “just a feeling of over-confidence” but “real negligence” by naa and NASA, Atwood reasserted that the most serious error made by naa and NASA was classification of the AS-204 test as “non-hazardous.” Questioned about the reasoning behind designing to minimize fire hazard, Dr. McCarthy pointed out that naa had concentrated on eliminating possible ignition sources while it turned out that the amount and placement of flammable materials was crucial.
He characterized this as a “grave error in judgment.” Atwood assured the Subcommittee that naa and NASA had “placed great stress” on the importance of quality and workmanship: “The procedures followed and the depth of inspection which have been employed far surpass those . . . used on any other program. The fact of the accident itself makes it obvious that we must do more than we have done, that we must—guided by the finding of the board—redouble our efforts to approach perfection. Already we have gone over every other design feature of the spacecraft to identify any other area of possible failures . . . [and] we have found none.” (ATT, 4/12/67, 34; W Star, 4/12/67, A6)
•	New York Times commented on Apollo 204 Review Board’s final report on
Jan. 27 flash fire: “Two months ago, on the basis of the incomplete evidence then available, we suggested that the Apollo catastrophe had taken place because ‘many men miscalculated—grossly.’ The official report . . . suggests that that conclusion was too kind . . . [since] the report convicts those in charge of Project Apollo of incompetence and negligence.
“The core of the problem is indicated in the board’s fifth finding: ‘Those organizations responsible for the planning, conduct and safety of this test failed to identify it as being hazardous. Contingency preparations to permit escape or rescue of the crew from an internal command module fire were not made.’
“How could those in charge of the test have ‘failed to identify it as being hazardous?’ The three astronauts had been put into what even a high school chemistry student would know was a potential oxygen incendiary bomb, one needing only a spark to initiate catastrophe. . . . But at Cape Kennedy, in the report’s words, ‘No procedures for this type of emergency had been established either for the crew or for the spacecraft pad work team.’
“The incredible complacency thus revealed overshadows even the other disgraceful and disheartening findings of the review board. . . . And as the record of incompetence and careless work—devastating in its impact—is recited in the report, one wonders how many of the previous manned space flights succeeded rather than how the Apollo tragedy occurred. . . .” (AIT, 4/11/67, 44M)

Since there is no provision for a check on space activity, the Soviet Union could push ahead with a variety of secret military programs in space while publicly attacking the right of the U.S. to an American military defense program in space. . . . Since the U.S. is an open society, any U.S. space defense program would be known. Since the Soviet society is closed, Moscow might well be able to keep its programs secret.

April 11—13: Witnesses testifying before Senate Commerce Committee expressed conflicting views on proposed Corporation for Public Television.
Ford Foundation consultant Fred W.

•	NASA had been concerned about oxygen fire danger prior to Jan. 27 flash
fire and had taken steps to curb the danger, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller told the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on NASA Oversight. NASA felt it “had control of the sources of ignition . . . [but] underestimated badly .. . the course such a fire would take. If more thorough testing of flammable materials used in the cockpit had been conducted, the accident might not have happened.” He denied emphatically April 11 suggestion by naa Director of Research and Engineering Dr. John F. McCarthy that Astronaut Gus Grissom could have triggered the fire by kicking loose a wire, and said he generally agreed with the Apollo 204
Review Board’s criticisms of deficiencies in project operations, conceding: “We were wrong in the standards we applied to the selection of materials for the spacecraft.” Efforts were currently being directed toward eliminating flammable cockpit materials such as nylon and replacing them with glass fiber cloth and Teflon plastic. Although a study was also under way to assess the relative merits of pure oxygen and two-gas life-support systems, Dr. Mueller doubted that present system would be abandoned.
In answer to specific questions concerning escape and rescue, Dr. Charles A. Berry, Director of Medical Research and Operations at msc, testified that the astronauts had died from asphyxia before the spacecraft hatch was opened and that their bums alone would not have caused death.
Apollo Program Director m/g Samuel C. Phillips told the Committee that his concern “about the load of work on naa” had prompted an inspection by a NASA team of naa’s Downey, Calif., plant.

April 13: NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., and Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller, testifying before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, absolved North American Aviation, Inc., of direct blame for the Jan. 27 Apollo fire but criticized contractor workmanship, naa “has not always been sufficiently dedicated to engineering design or workmanship” in the Apollo program and “did not address itself properly to the training and supervision of its personnel and the adequate inspection of the work that was done,” Dr. Seamans charged. As a result of NASA’s demand for numerous management reforms in late 1965, naa had made “marked improvement ... in the last year and a half,” Dr. Seamans noted, but he stressed that “it should not have been necessary for the Government to take this kind of strenuous action.”
Dr. Seamans told the Committee that NASA would implement Apollo 204 Review Board’s recommendations and build stronger discipline into technical requirements, schedules and management while placing the Apollo program “back on a firm operating schedule.” He asserted that nothing in the Board’s report suggested that the fundamental design or management structure was faulty. Basic revelation of the accident was fallibility, he stated.

April 17: nasa’s Surveyor III (Surveyor C) was successfully launched from etr by Atlas-Centaur (AC-12) booster on 65-hr lunar intercept trajectory. Primary mission for the 2,283-lb spacecraft was to perform a soft-landing east of the Surveyor I landing site within the Apollo zone and to obtain post-landing TV pictures of the lunar surface. As secondary mission spacecraft would obtain data on lunar surface bearing strength, radar reflectivity, and thermal properties and photograph use of a surface sampler to manipulate the lunar surface [see April 19].
At 34:53 GET Surveyor III with two-bum Centaur—being used for the first time on a Surveyor mission—separated from Atlas and ignited to reach 100-mi-altitude circular parking orbit where it coasted for 22 min; Centaur then reignited to escape earth orbit and boost spacecraft toward the moon. Surveyor III separated from Centaur, deployed its solar panels, and locked on the sun and the star Canopus. Based on a 248-mi target miss estimate, a 4.2-mi midcourse maneuver was conducted shortly after midnight April 18 to assure precise landing on target in the Ocean of Storms.
Surveyor III was third in series of seven spacecraft designed to prove out design, develop technology of lunar soft-landing, obtain post-landing TV pictures of lunar surface, and provide basic scientific and engineering data in support of Project Apollo. Surveyor program was directed by ossa Lunar and Planetary Programs Div.; project management was assigned to JPL; Atlas-Centaur launch vehicle was managed by Lewis Research Center; and prime contractor for spacecraft development and design was Hughes Aircraft Co.

•	The press praised Apollo 204 Review Board’s investigation of Jan. 27
flash fire.
Technology Week: “The harsh, scathing report of the Apollo 204 Review Board has effectively laid to rest charges that the board was assembled to conduct a whitewash of the January 27 fire, which took the lives of three astronauts. The board should be commended for the vigor with which it undertook to establish the cause of the fire, the energy with which it attacked what it regards as dangerous practices and procedures and the directness with which it distributes the blame. . . . Perhaps the question that will linger longest about the January tragedy is the part played by the pressure of the lunar landing deadlines. We personally believe that such target dates play a large and important factor in motivating the space program and keeping it moving at a healthy pace. But they should not be so sacred as to invoke carelessness. . . . Without waiting for another accident, it might be well to undertake the same sort of review of practices and procedures throughout the major elements of Apollo that has just taken place in regard to the spacecraft. . . . The Apollo 204 Review Board has set a good example of what can be accomplished.” (Coughlin, Tech Wk, 4/17/67, 50)
Aviation Week: “Its report is technically incisive and sharply critical of NASA and the private contractors manufacturing Apollo hardware. It is as thorough and technically solid as any other investigation of aerospace disaster in the past three decades. It disproves earlier charges that NASA is incapable of investigating its own technical faults. In fact, it would have been impossible to assemble another group sufficiently knowledgeable about the Apollo system from any other source to complete a useful investigation within this time span.
“. . . there are none of the pat answers, so often demanded by legislators and harping critics, to the dangerous and complex problems of probing the unknown. Apollo is man’s most daring foray in his history on this planet. If all the problems involved in a lunar voyage were so obvious and the solutions so simple as many critics seem to think, we could all buy tickets for a lunar excursion tomorrow.” (Hotz, Av Wk, 4/17/67, 21)

•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb told the Senate Committee on Aeronau-
tical and Space Sciences that NASA would present, within two weeks, detailed estimates of how much the Jan. 27 Apollo accident had cost; what changes in spacecraft would be made to reduce fire hazards; and the earliest date for the first manned Apollo mission. He declined to disclose his thoughts concerning canceling nasa’s contract with North American Aviation, Inc., because of failures to meet development schedules and stay within cost estimates: “They did not do all die things
they should have done, but I can say the same thing about us at NASA.” He stated his conviction that he was obligated to “act responsibly in respecting confidences between himself and contractors.” Denying that undue risks were taken in order to speed the program, Webb emphasized that NASA had “never put schedule above safety.” Apollo 204 Review Board’s study was “a good report,” he said, but it should not be construed to be an evaluation of the entire space program: “The board has done an outstanding investigation of one accident but it is not a full and fair appraisal of the space program... [and] cannot be taken as a guide to the realities of this program. . . .” In response to questioning Webb stated that, in his judgment, the pacing item in the manned lunar landing program remained the Saturn V booster, and when it was ready for manned flight there would be a spacecraft ready.
Committee Chairman Clinton P. Anderson (D-N.Mex.) requested that nasa witnesses appear again not later than May 9 to detail changes the program, as suggested by Webb. (Wilford, NYT, 4/18/67, C26; O’Toole, W Post, 4/18/67, Al; SBD, 4/18/67, 275)
• Astronauts Donald K. Slayton, Alan B. Shepard, Walter M. Schirra, Jr., Frank Borman, and James A. McDivitt, testifying before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on NASA Oversight, expressed confidence in NASA’s management of U.S. space program. They noted that there had been only one mishap in the program, compared with 16 successful manned flights under the same management. Since fire had been foreseen as a significant danger in orbit but not on the launch pad before fueling of the launch vehicle, everyone had been “lulled into a sense of false security . . . [and] grossly underestimated the fire potential of the spacecraft,” they said. Schirra explained confidence astronauts felt prior to the fire Jan. 27: “The back-up crew [of which Schirra was commander] had left the Cape with the feeling that we had a good spacecraft behind us. ... I was not at all prepared for the news I received when I arrived at Houston.” (Hines, W Star, 4/18/67, 1)

April 18: NASA Administrator James E. Wehh submitted summary of m/g Samuel Phillips’ (usaf) report on North American Aviation, Inc.’s workmanship (the “Phillips Report”) to the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences: “Our main criticism was that the Space and Information Division was overmanned and that the S—II and CSM programs could be done, and done better by fewer people, better organized with particular emphasis on achieving greater competence in key management and technical positions. . . . Work tasks were inadequately defined and scheduled . . . and, largely as a result of these conditions, budget and control were deficient.
. . in each of . . . [the] problem areas we identified in December 1965, we found . . . improvement in the situation in April 1966. I do not intend, however, to leave the impression that we were completely satisfied with North American’s performance. We did determine . . . that the corrective actions already taken and those in the process of being implemented in April 1966 were appropriate ones that reflected a responsive reaction by naa to the criticism we had expressed during our review and provided some measure of confidence for improved future performance. . . .”
Testifying in support of NASA’s FY 1968 budget, Webb warned against ; permitting the Jan. 27 Apollo accident to deter U.S. space efforts. It should not, he said, “lead us to lose sight of the continued progress and vigorous efforts the Soviets are making. . . . With the world situation what it is, and with clear indications that the Soviets are going ahead with a large-scale, long-term program in space, it is especially important this year for the United States to let the world know that we cannot and will not surrender our hard-won position, even though we will not mount the larger effort required to catch up with them.” Describing the proposed budget as “forward looking,” Webb conceded that it would not “enable us [nasa] to move toward important goals with as much assurance as we would like.” He outlined NASA’s planned program and urged support for all future projects: “If we fail to make these decisions in our consideration of the 1968 budget, they will go by default. . . . Later when we find we do not have the capabilities we could have had and that others are accomplishing what we might have achieved, it will be too late.” (Wood, W Post, 4/19/67, A9; Sehlstedt, B Sun, 4/19/67, I)

Science and Applications, testifying on nasa FY 1968 authorization bill (H.R. 6470) before House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications, said he had “high confidence that we can sterilize the Voyager system by 1973 to the satisfaction of the biologists.” He disagreed with the opinion of Dr. N. H. Horowitz (Cal Tech) that U.S. was adhering to sterilization standards which were exceedingly severe and represented an obstacle to U.S. plans for planetary exploration [see March 24]. To support his view, Cortright presented a summary of the findings of Spacecraft Sterilization Advisory Board, chaired by Dr. Richard Bond, Univ. of Minnesota, which was “examining the statements” made by Dr. Horowitz. Cortright said it was felt that “probably Prof. Horowitz has overestimated the difficulty posed by the current sterilization requirements and underestimated the ability of aerospace companies and government laboratories to cope with it.” Most of the components and parts NASA planned to use in Voyager and sterilize were already “demonstrably sterilizable,” so there seemed to be no justification in abandoning a goal which the majority of the scientific community feels is legitimate.” (Transcript)

•	Letter to editor of Space Business Daily by unidentified leader in U.S. space
program attacked nasa’s use of pure oxygen in life-support systems: “. . . most engineering people in industry, most reputable bio-engineering people in usaf and NASA felt two gas was the way to go. In addition, there has never been an overwhelming engineering reason for a pure oxygen system. . . . The argument of reliability and complexity is ludicrous when you examine the complexity of other systems in the spacecraft and booster. Now it is even more ironic in that, if pure oxygen is kept, all sorts of complicating compensations must be made. The truth is that a few key people in NASA flew in the face of strong industry technical advice against pure oxygen. To add to the problem, Gemini made them cocky and they forgot completely the sleeping monster they had created. Take anyone, regardless of skill and training, show him a fire in pure oxygen, and ask him if he’d agree to live in pure oxygen with that danger in the complex environment of a spacecraft. The answer is painfully obvious. Now we’ll make a bad situation worse by jury rigging a system to avoid pure oxygen on the pad—but—we’ll stiff have it in space.
“nasa and everyone must face it. It was a bad decision compounded by complacency, for example, the hatch design. If the atmosphere were two gas, chances are, survival would have occurred. Let’s get guts, fix the basic deficiency and take the delay. That is the only answer and sooner or later it must be faced.” (SBD, 4/19/67, 282)

April 19-30: NASA’s Surveyor III became second U.S. spacecraft to soft-land on the moon when it touched down in the Ocean of Storms after 64 hr 59 min flight and began transmitting the first of 5,487 detailed television pictures to jpl Deep Space Facilities, Goldstone, Calif.
Landing sequence began when Surveyor III shifted its normal cruising attitude to position main retrorocket. Triggered by radar (later ejected), main retromotor burned and slowed spacecraft to about 250 mph. Vernier engines, which were to have slowed spacecraft to about 3 mph, failed to cut off at 14 ft above lunar surface as planned, and the 620-lb spacecraft made three separate landings—covering distance of 33 ft—before engines shut off 37 sec after initial touchdown.
April 19-30: Lunar material scooped onto Surveyor 111 footpad by surface sampler on the moon was photographed through red filter in spacecraft’s TV camera April 26. Color calibration chart in foreground is mounted on the spacecraft’s leg.
First pictures transmitted were unclear because of sun’s brightness, but later photos were excellent. They revealed that spacecraft was resting in a depression or small crater with 5° slope—which was expected to hinder photography of lunar horizon—and showed impressions made by footpads during multiple landing. Shortly after touchdown a telemetry malfunction falsely indicated major drain on power system, but photos confirmed that spacecraft’s batteries were intact and undamaged.
In addition to photographic equipment, including two additional mirrors to expand camera’s field of view, spacecraft also carried a shovel-like surface sampler which would scoop soil, move debris, and strike lunar rock with an expandable arm operated by radio signals from earth. On April 21—22 sampler began bearing strength tests and excavation of trenches up to six inches deep. On April 23-24, cooled by two-hour lunar eclipse, Surveyor III took 118 excellent color photos of Venus, a star duster, and earth as it passed between the moon and the sun.

scientists concluded that lunar soil had consistency similar to wet sand and a bearing strength of about six pounds per square inch—firm enough to support Apollo spacecraft. Cal Tech professor and advisor to JPL on soil mechanics Dr. Ronald F. Scott explained: “The surface is like ordinary soil... a lot like fine grained sod or damp beach sand, and it behaves in perhaps a disappointingly ordinary way. The area presents no hazardous conditions and looks good for a landing site. An astronaut walking across the surface would not need snowshoes.” On May 3 communications with spacecraft were halted temporarily to conserve battery strength throughout two-week lunar night.
Performance of Surveyor III, with equipment identical to Surveyor
I	and Surveyor II except for soil sampler and two additional mirrors, was near flawless, and expected lifetime was indefinite. Surveyor I was launched May 30, 1966, successfully softlanded on moon June 2, 1966, in Ocean of Storms, and transmitted 10,338 pictures to earth. Surveyor
II	was successfully launched Sept. 20, 1966, but failed to softland because of an ignition failure, (nasa Proj. Off; NASA Release 67-85; upi, W Star, 4/23/67, A10; O’Toole, W Post, 4/22/67, A4; 4/23/67, Al)
April 20: NASA successfully launched Essa V (tos-c), fifth meteorological satellite in ESSA’s Tiros Operational Satellite (tos) system, from WTR using Thrust-Augmented Thor-Delta booster. Satellite achieved nearly-polar, sun-synchronous orbit with 883-mi (1,421-km) apogee; 840-mi (1,352-km) perigee; 113.5-min period; and 101.9° inclination. Wheel orientation maneuver would be completed during 18th orbit [see April 24], at which time first photos would be programmed and NASA would check out spacecraft before turning its operation over to essa.
An advanced version of the cartwheel configuration, 325-lb Essa V carried two Advanced Vidicon Camera System (avcs) cameras which would provide 24-hr global weather coverage. Photos would be stored on magnetic tape until readout by essa’s Command and Data Acquisition (cda) stations at Fairbanks, Alaska, and Wallops Island, Va., to supplement Essa III—expected to become almost completely inoperable by early June.

Estimated cost over 10 yrs would be $2 billion: $500 million would be needed to develop nuclear stage and $1 billion for ground testing. NASA’s decision to develop Nerva II was based primarily on “our own national objectives in space; what do we do in the future; now looking ahead to the late ’70s and ’80s, as a requirement for booster capability in this country. . . . However, we also must consider our capability in the world arena and, of course, specifically today we have to be cognizant the best that we can of the Russian capability and the Russian plans.” Dr. Seamans noted that Soviet Proton booster could launch 50,000 lbs into earth orbit, corn-
pared to 40,000-41,000-lb capability of Uprated Saturn I. “We have every reason to believe that in the [Soviet] program they recognized the same kind of needs that we recognized for our program and that they are moving on a broad front, including the development of very large boosters,” (Transcript, 1131-4)

Experts avalanched data on the committees until . . . [they had] far more technical information than they could possibly handle. . . .” Hines cited statement by Sen. Walter Mondale (D-Minn.) which “got to the very core” of the problem: “ ‘I am not interested in knowing enough about building spacecraft so that I can build one in my backyard, but I do think I have a responsibility to know enough about questions of management, contractor performance and quality control so I can pass judgment on the question of whether these are fundamental issues that we need to deal with.’ ”

April 21: Seven members of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcommittee on NASA Oversight continued hearings on Jan. 27 Apollo accident at ksc by touring AS-204 launch pad and questioning eyewitnesses.
Donald Nichols, assistant test manager at ksc, told the Subcommittee that the decision to keep the hatch closed during Jan. 27 Apollo rehearsal might have cost die lives of the crew. On Oct. 31, 1966, he said, decision was made to change plans that would have kept the hatch open until the crew had been better trained on emergency procedures. Officials decided that hatch could be locked and emergency escape practice conducted after the test, he said. If test procedures had not been changed, the hatch would have been open or the astronauts not present in the spacecraft.
Thomas R. Baron, former North American Aviation, Inc., quality control inspector, said that Apollo 1 astronauts smelled smoke in their spacecraft 12 min before they died and tried for five minutes to escape. This information, he said, had been supplied by naa electrical technician Mervin Holmberg.
Holmberg later made a surprise appearance before the Subcommittee and denied Baron’s allegation: “I listened to his [Baron’s] speculation, but I didn’t make any comment” on what caused the fire. “I wasn’t even near the accident when it happened.” Baron, who had submitted a report to NASA [see During March] prior to Jan. 27 accident charging laxity, poor morale, and bad management on the part of naa, was sharply criticized by subcommittee members, and his statement was disclaimed.

•	Aquanauts diving to extremely low ocean depths should breathe almost pure
hydrogen in their diving suits, Dr. R. W. Brauer of Wrightsville Marine Bio-Medical Laboratory suggested at Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Chicago. Dr. Brauer planned to subject himself to such an atmosphere—98% hydrogen and 2% oxygen—at a

Divers long ago passed the depth limits that were feasible with compressed air and were now approaching the probable safe limits with an atmosphere in which helium was the major ingredient, Dr. Brauer said. Yet oil drilling, prospecting operations, and other undersea activities were pushing divers to further depths which required new types of atmosphere and, possibly, drugs to modify the narcotic effects produced by the high pressure air.

April 21—23: Editorial comment on NASA Surveyor IITs successful softlanding on the moon April 19.
Miami News: “The National Aeronautics and Space Administration badly needed a victory to demonstrate that the moon program is not threatened by technical deficiencies, as the Apollo investigation seems to suggest. The landing of Surveyor III . . . and the transmission of TV picture fills the bill. . . . There is no denying, however, that Apollo is in serious difficulty . . . [and] NASA is creating the impression that it is unwilling to see the investigation carried to a complete conclusion. . . . Surveyor and dozens of similar achievements demonstrate that the overall space program has been a remarkable success. NASA would make a mistake to see the luster of this record dimmed by its failure to cooperate fully in the Apollo investigation.” (Miami News, A/21/67)
New York Times: “Inevitably, Surveyor 3 calls attention to the fact that the first stages of lunar study and exploration do not require men, that the moon can be investigated to a considerable extent without incurring either the great risks or high costs of manned lunar flight. From the scientific and technical points of view, Surveyor-type flights are a rational and feasible alternative to Apollo. . . . Manned space exploration has unavoidable dangers, but these are multiplied many times by the pressure of the 1970 deadline that dominates the Apollo project. What Surveyor 3 has done is to remind us that—aside from propaganda and prestige considerations—there is no need to endanger brave men’s lives.” (NYT, 4/23/67,10B)
Washington Post: “With the success in landing Surveyor III . . .
[nasa] once again exhibited its stunning scientific and technological skills. . . . Surely the time cannot be far off when men will be shuttling from earth to the moon—and far beyond. . . . Bold ventures of mankind are always undertaken in din of criticism, and the manned flight to the moon will be no exception to the rule. Space exploration will continue—not because it excites expectations of an El Dorado or a Fountain of Youth—but because it is an inescapable challenge to human curiosity and imagination.” ( W Post, 4/23/67, C6)
April 23-24: U.S.S.R. successfully launched Soyuz I spacecraft with Vladimir M. Komarov, but mission ended 26 hrs after launch when spacecraft failed to reenter properly and crash-landed, killing Cosmonaut Komarov.
Launched April 23 from Baikonur by a “powerful new carrier rocket,” Soyuz / entered initial orbit “close to the estimated one,” Tass announced with unprecedented speed, only one hour 20 min after launch. Orbital parameters: apogee, 224 km (139 mi); perigee, 201 km (125 mi); period, 88.1 min; inclination, 51.4°. Onboard equipment was “functioning normally” and Komarov was “in good health and feeling well.” During the flight Tass distributed only a few terse reports in contrast to extensive publicity usually accorded manned missions. Final announcement, which followed 11-hr silence, said accident occurred during 18th orbit after program of test flight had been completed and spacecraft had been successfully braked with retrorockets for reentry. “. .. when the main parachute was opened at an altitude of seven kilometers [4.3 mi], the lines of the parachute, according to preliminary information, got snarled and the spaceship descended at great speed, which resulted in Komarov’s death.” Tass did not report whether the cosmonaut had a personal parachute to attempt an escape. Western experts believed Soyuz I was tumbling or spinning out of control during reentry : when parachutes were deployed, tumbling caused them to tangle among themselves or wrap around spacecraft resulting in crash-landing. Experts said difficulties apparently developed earlier in the flight because Komarov tried to reenter during 15th orbit but was unable to control his spacecraft.
Informed sources had speculated that mission involved the launch of a second spacecraft carrying several cosmonauts that would dock with Soyuz I and permit at least one cosmonaut to transfer from second spacecraft to Soyuz I. Tass’s official announcement said mission would “test the new piloted spaceship, check the ship’s system and elements in conditions of space flight, conduct expanded scientific and physical-technical experiments and studies in conditions of space flight, and continue medical and biological studies on the influence of various factors of space flight on the human organisms.” Mstislav Keldysh, President of Soviet Academy of Sciences, said on April 26 that Soyuz I spacecraft had been tested previously in two to four unmanned flights. Weight, size, and capacity of new spacecraft were not revealed.
Immediately following the accident, which was first known fatality during a space flight, the Kremlin announced it was appointing a Government commission to investigate “all the circumstances” of the cosmonaut’s death. Komarov would be cremated and buried in the Kremlin Wall—a final resting place for Soviet heroes—and a monument would be erected on the site of his birthplace in Moscow.

Komarov.
President Johnson: “The death of Vladimir Komarov is a tragedy in which all nations share. Like three American astronauts who lost their lives recently, this distinguished space pioneer died in the cause of science and in the eternal spirit of human adventure.” ~
Vice President Humphrey: “It is with great sorrow that we learn of the tragedy involving Vladimir Komarov. The loss of a dedicated life is indeed a heavy price. Yet progress and space development is necessary.” NASA Administrator James E. Webb: “All of us who have faced the difficulties of understanding and putting to use the forces of nature at the outer edge of Man’s knowledge of what is possible in this decade deeply regret the loss of life represented by the death of Cosmonaut Komarov, and extend our sincere sympathy to his family and associates. We feel certain that man will achieve great things in space. Some of these will determine what the men will be able to do on earth.
“We also feel that at this dawn of the space age, man has the duty to seek cooperation between nations, such as the USSR and the United States on a realistic basis.
“We at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration want to make every realistic effort. Could the lives already lost have been saved if we had known each other’s hopes, aspirations and plans? Or could they have been saved if full cooperation had been the order of the day?” U.S. astronauts: “We are very saddened by the loss of Colonel Komarov. We feel comradeship for this test pilot because we have met several of his fellow cosmonauts and we are involved in a pioneering flight effort which is not without hazards.” (Text; PD, 5/1/67, 660; AP, NYT, 4/25/67, 21)

•	Water might have played an important role in shaping the lunar surface,
Dr. Harold C. Urey, Univ. of California physicist, told National Academy of Sciences. As evidence to support his theory of the former existence of “lakes” on the lunar surface, Dr. Urey showed spacecraft photos of the moon’s surface in which material had filled in depressions as though it were free-flowing. He also cited carbon-rich meteorites which seemed to be fragments of ancient lake beds. Dr. Urey believed many, if not all, the stony meteorites were fragments dislodged from the moon by impacting objects such as iron meteorites. As further evidence of water action, he noted the presence of meteorites within which numerous founded fragments were embedded which appeared to have been shaped by frictional effects within flowing material. A body much smaller than the moon would not have had sufficient gravity for this flow effect, Dr. Urey argued. (Sullivan, NYT, 4/25/67,23)

•New York Times praised Senate ratification of the space law treaty April 25 and called for increased international cooperation in space: “Ideally, the probing of space and the planets would be the province of a World Space Organization affiliated with the United Nations, financed by the contributions of all nations desiring to participate, and drawing upon the technical manpower and knowledge of all nations. This international organization could be the owner of the moon and other solar bodies, arranging for the exploitation of resources found there, and using any extraterrestrial profits for the benefit of all men.
“It will take much time before such an ideal can be reached. But even now the more sober spirit evident in Moscow and Washington opens the door to greater bilateral cooperation. Both nations have technical knowledge in this field that they could exchange to their mutual advantage. Their space tracking and rescue facilities could be coordinated into a single world system; they could agree on a division of labor that would eliminate such duplication as is represented by Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter. The result could easily be major savings in money and increased safety for all astronauts, regardless of nationality.” (NYT, 4/26/67)

During April: The U.S. press commented on the April 24 death of Soviet Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov.
New York Times: “Men have risked their lives in pioneering since history began—explorers, mountain climbers, the first aviators who conquered the globe’s blanket of air, and now the cosmonauts who enter the ‘infinite spaces.’ That much has to be accepted—but how much? It seems clear that the three Americans who died in the oxygen fire at Cape Kennedy were victims of insufficient care, slipshod work and haste. There is no way of knowing whether similar factors led to the death of Komarov yesterday; but it is a fact that the Russians are aiming at time schedules, hoping to beat the United States to the moon, trying to meet
special dates connected with the fiftieth anniversary of their Revolution. The United States still insists on trying to reach the moon by 1970.
“Both nations are duplicating costly and dangerous work. Thus good and brave men die unnecessarily, vast sums are wasted, and without doubt the progress that humanity could make through cooperation in the thrilling quest for knowledge of the universe is being hampered by pride, prestige and the nebulous possibility of strategic gain.” (NYT, 4/25/67,40)
Philadelphia Evening Bulletin• “. . . hard on the heels of a test disaster that took the lives of three U.S. Apollo astronauts, tragedy has also struck the Russian space program with the crash of a new giant spacecraft and the death of its pilot, Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. . . .
“Had the Russians succeeded in mounting a new space spectacular at this time, it is possible that some of the sobering impact of the Apollo on this country would have been dissipated. Although there have been repeated disclaimers of a space ‘race,’ the sight of the Soviet Union again forging ahead would surely have fanned anew American competitive instincts. Surely the death of brave men on both sides will reemphasize for both the element of human fallibility and the need for offsetting it with infinite pains and caution in space exploration.” (P EB, 4/25/67)
Technology Week: “The Soviet tragedy, by emphasizing the hazards of space flight, has perhaps eased some of the pressure of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and North American Aviation. There is more awareness now that the exploration of space will not be a series of glittering successes, one after another. There are dangers; there will be further tragedies, other brave men to mourn. While bringing home the care which must always be taken, the Soviet accident also makes it clear that in programs of this magnitude humans are not always infallible. . . .” (Coughlin, Tech Wk, 5/1/67, 50)
Aviation Week and Space Technology: “It is fortunate that the Apollo and Soyuz tragedies came this far downstream in the history of manned space flight. If they had occurred in the initial phases of Vostok or Mercury, the hue and cry of technical timidity in both countries might have killed the manned space flight programs before they had a chance to demonstrate their technical feasibility. Viewed against the perspective of Vostok, Mercury, Voskhod and Gemini and more than 2,000 hr of successful space flight logged by crews of both nations, the recent tragedies spotlight development problems but do not raise any fundamental doubts about man’s ability to reach the moon. . . .” (Hotz, Av Wk, 5/1/67,11)
• Press commented on Congressional hearings on Apollo accident.
Philadelphia Inquirer: “With both the House and Senate conducting their own investigations of the Apollo tragedy, in the aftermath of the exhaustive inquiry by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s own review board, there is a danger that what will result is a negative witch hunt instead of constructive criticism of benefit to the space program. Congress should strive to protect the Nation’s investment in this critically important and expensive venture and that is not to be accomplished by laboring the deficiencies of Apollo I. Above all, the concern should be for the safety of future space voyagers. It should be to certify that no unnecessary risks will be taken that might invite another lethal disaster.” (P Inq, 4/12/67)
New York Times: “It is a new, and rather shocking, NASA image that is being projected by the current Congressional investigations into the Apollo tragedy. One would have expected that NASA would make available every possible bit of relevant information. . . . The Space Administration cannot afford even to raise the suspicion that it may be covering up evidence relevant to the deaths of the three astronauts . . . [and] certainly does not want to reinforce the view of cynics who insist that NASA actually stands for ‘Never A Straight Answer.’ ” (NYT, 4/19/67, 40)
Washington Post: NASA “has merited the reproach of the investigators of the Apollo disaster and the searching scrutiny of the congressional committees reviewing the program. . . . What must not be overlooked however, are the risks of the space program that cannot be eliminated
altogether without abandoning it___When these catastrophes take place,
the Government and the people must and should react as they reacted to the Apollo fire, by demanding new and further precautions, even more careful and complete protection. But there will not be much bold venturing in a society that visits a sanguinary fury upon those unfortunate enough to preside over calamity. For in that kind of society, more and more men will discover that the way to avoid getting any reproach is to avoid taking any risks.” (W Post, 4/19/67)

Those who are knowledgeable recognize that we have gone past the point of no return in giving full support to the Apollo lunar landing program. But many Congressmen are concerned about our course in the future exploration of space. When you relate the financial demand of another big quantum jump in space technology to our other fiscal burdens, you get the feeling that the 90th Congress will not be willing to embark on another major manned space program beyond the moon that will lead to another commitment of five or ten years or longer.” (GE Forum, 4/6/67,11-4)

•	American Astronautical Society’s (aas) 13th Annual Convention, “Com-
mercial Utilization of Space,” was held in Dallas.
msfc Director Dr. Wernher von Braun stressed the importance of space exploration to man’s general welfare: “The space program is providing us with new and valuable scientific information about our environment in this universe. The space budget cannot be justified, however, solely on the basis of expanding scientific knowledge, even though the discoveries may be regarded priceless by one segment of society. Space technology must continue and expand its contributions to the satisfaction of the needs and desires of society in general if it is to become a permanent outlet for man’s creativity and energies.” Dr. von Braun later suggested to the press that the lunar module (lm) might not be ready for the Apollo lunar mission as soon as the other launch vehicle and spacecraft elements. In that event, he said, NASA might decide to “fly the lunar mission [as a manned circumlunar flight], but just not activate one phase of it.” (Text; Av Wk, 5/8/67, 17) Future potentials of navigation satellites were outlined by Eugene Ehrlich, Navigation and Traffic Control Program Chief, OSSA. Navigation satellites could provide: (1) high-accuracy position determination service to craft, people, and shore stations; (2) communications service to pilots, traffic controllers, and passengers; (3) air traffic control and maritime coordination; (4) sst radiation warning; (5) search and rescue aid during emergencies; (6) weather routing for aircraft and ships; (7) iceberg warning; and (8) data on migratory habits of marine, land, and sea life.

George S. Trimble, Director of Advanced Planning, omsf, called for increased industry responsibility in space exploration. NASA builds “the roads into space. It is beholden on . . . industry to make certain that we build the proper ones for . . . future use. ...

A more realistic basis for determining space transportation costs should be devised to reflect actual use of the object in space, ksc Director Dr. Kurt H. Debus suggested. Although cost reductions were being studied, prospective commercial users of space should expect to spend about 10% of their overall program costs for launch operations, he said. He emphasized that more substantial savings could be realized in other areas such as reusable boosters and payload; increased life cycle of payload; reserviceable payload; and booster and spacecraft propulsion.

NASA Assistant Administrator for International Affairs Arnold W. Frutkin noted that space program had to defend itself continuously to enlist international support: “In ten years of space development, no nation has been harmed in any way. We must point to this record constantly in order to improve the atmosphere and wisdom of international consideration . . . [and] emphasize the expansion of benefits rather than restrictions upon progress. The record makes clear that we can address the more complicated questions of international organization on an evolutionary basis with the advantage of growing experience. The needs of the developing world and the magnificent record of space applications so far combine to show that the issues of international organization are secondary to the task of accelerating benefits for the world.” (Text)

Turning to discussion of impact of space program on engineering practices, they cited a major stimulus which was produced by “. . . the extreme environment of outer space combined with the requirements for low weight, small size, and exceptional reliability.” They pointed to the new stimulus to “imagination and creativity” among engineers. Among important reasons for having a space program they listed satisfaction of society’s needs; developing technology should serve as “. . . a solution to an existing or foreseeable social problem.”

TRW Systems Group President Dr. Ruben F. Mettler suggested that space environmental characteristics could be useful and, in some ways, unique for certain manufacturing operations. He stated: “An environment so widely different from that to which we are accustomed suggests we [determine] whether the new features can be used for making conventional products of improved quality or performance or at lower cost, whether they can support new processes previously considered impractical, or if they can lead to new products of such characteristics that they create new and currently unidentified markets.” Mettler suggested these environmental characteristics for space operations which would be of interest to “possible specialized manufacturing operations”: low temperatures, approaching absolute zero with use of space cryostat; high temperatures with use of solar concentrator; near-perfect vacuum of infinite extent; weightlessness in orbit; low gravitational forces on moon; and radiation environment.

May 4: NASA’s Lunar Orbiter IV (Lunar Orb iter D) unmanned spacecraft was successfully launched by Atlas-Agena D booster from ETR on mission to photograph lunar surface [see May 8-June 1].
Agena 2nd stage fired to boost 850-lb spacecraft into 100-mi (161km) -altitude parking orbit, reignited after 21-min coast period, injecting spacecraft on 89-hr translunar trajectory, and separated. On schedule Lunar Orbiter IV deployed its four solar panels and two antennas, locked its five sensors on the sun, and fixed its star tracker on Canopus. At 16:45 GMT midcourse maneuver with 53.8-sec engine burn was successfully conducted to slow spacecraft’s speed and alter its aim point slightly.
Primary objectives of NASA’s Lunar Orbiter IV mission, fourth in series of five, were (1) to place three-axis stabilized spacecraft into high-inclination lunar orbit; (2) to obtain broad systematic photographic survey of lunar surface; (3) to improve knowledge of the moon; and (4) to provide basis for selecting sites for more detailed scientific study by subsequent orbital and landing missions. Full photographic flight plan would require more than 200 camera-pointing maneuvers, compared to 50 for Lunar Orbiter III. Photos would cover more than 80% of the moon’s front face and more than 90% of the hidden side. Spacecraft would also monitor micrometeoroids and radiation intensity in the lunar environment, refine definition of moon’s gravitational field, and serve as a target for tracking operations by Manned Space Flight Network stations. Lunar Orbiter program was managed by LaRC under OSSA direction. Tracking and communications were the responsibility of jPL-operated Deep Space Network, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 67-101)
•	North American Aviation, Inc., President J. Leland Atwood assured the
Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences that naa was
making numerous technical, inspection, and management changes that would enable U.S. to “effectively accomplish the lunar mission in this decade.” He accepted naa’s share of responsibility for Jan. 27 Apollo fire but urged the Committee to view the deficiencies cited by Apollo 204 Review Board [see April 9] in the perspective of the standards involved. “... it must be recognized that in space work the standards are and must be extremely high. Literally perfection is the goal.” Noting that many of the problems in naa’s management of the Apollo program had resulted from “a rapid build-up in manpower . . . encountered in almost all large, complex developmental programs,” Atwood explained that the survey of naa workmanship summarized in the Phillips Report [see April 18] had been conducted during time when these problems were reaching their peak. Thus the report did not truly represent overall naa performance “but reflected the fact that the [Apollo] mission criteria had been evolving towards their final form.” Atwood stressed, however, that General Phillips’ recommendations had been accepted and corrected to NASA’s “general satisfaction” by April 1966.
To further improve Apollo program progress, Atwood said, he and NASA Administrator James E. Webb had reviewed “the overall working relationship” between naa and NASA. As a result of this review efforts would be made to (1) improve coordination of management effectiveness and program control; (2) establish clearer and more specific objectives and measurement techniques for program performance; (3) conduct more periodic surveys and audits of program progress and performance; and (4) include sharper incentives and penalties in contract relationships. Only major changes in Apollo spacecraft would be incorporation of a quick-opening hatch and installation of additional insulation for interior wiring and tubing.

Johnson appoint a high-level commission to fully investigate NASA and to determine whether NASA “has the competence to carry out the space program and to recommend changes in the agency to insure that our space program is efficiently and safely administered.” Asserting that Americans “must have complete confidence in the administration of the space program” in order to give it unqualified support, he insisted that only a commission of non-NASA officials could thoroughly evaluate NASA. “From the [Apollo accident] testimony and subsequent developments it is clear that the entire management capability and supervisory competence of NASA is in question.
“.. . NASA is not competently administering one of the largest Federal programs . .. [and] has been extremely reluctant to be candid about its operations. There is every reason to believe that NASA will not examine itself sufficiently to form the basis for the changes that are needed to insure that there are no further catastrophes.” (CR, 5/4/67, H5109-13)
•	Former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev made at least two offers in the
early 1960’s to show to the U.S. photos of U.S. military bases taken by orbiting Soviet satellites “in return for certain favors,” Dr. Charles S. Sheldon, formerly an NASC staff member and currently at the Library of Congress, told an aiaa meeting in Atlanta. He declined to specify what favors Khrushchev wanted. Dr. Sheldon said frequent launchings of satellites into low circular orbits indicated strongly that U.S.S.R. was observing U.S. from space: “I think there’s little doubt they are in the
observation business.” It was difficult to ascertain the status of the Soviet manned space program, he said, but U.S.S.R. might feel ready to attempt a manned orbit of the moon within the next year. Concerning reports that several cosmonauts had died during space flights, Dr. Sheldon said U.S.S.R. had definitely not lost any men in orbit and probably had not lost any men in the space program before the April 24 death of Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. He acknowledged the death of a man in a parachute accident and the death of a Soviet test pilot, but said he was not certain these deaths were involved in the space program. (AP, B Sun,

May 8—June 1: NASA’s Lunar Orbiter IV became fourth U.S. spacecraft to circle moon when it entered lunar orbit following successful deboost maneuver which reduced its speed by 1,475 mph, permitting lunar capture. Orbital parameters: apolune, 3,797 mi (6,111 km); perilune,
1,681 mi (2,706 km); period, 72 hr 1 min; and inclination, 85.5°. Launched from etr May 4, spacecraft performed 670 attitude changes, responded to 7,067 commands, and recorded two micrometeoroid hits. Spacecraft performed normally except for five-day period when camera thermal door operated improperly, causing overexposure and fogging. Problem was solved, however, and 193 medium- and high-resolution photos—including coverage of 99% of moon’s front face—were taken with almost a hundredfold increase in discernible detail for most of the area covered. Final readout, underway since mission’s photo-acquisition phase was terminated May 26 because of an encoder failure, was completed June 1.
By its telephoto coverage of eastern limb areas, Lunar Orbiter IV provided the basis for extending the cartographic grid system established for front-face mapping around to the hidden side, so that features there could be precisely located for future mission planning and operations. Initial photos, taken at 2,176-mi altitude, showed broad panorama of moon’s South Pole region—which had never before been photographed—with typical rugged terrain of craters and ridges. Closer, wide-angle pictures of this area revealed a 200- by 10-mi crevice which scientists speculated had been formed by volcanic action. Other photos transmitted included excellent pictures of the Alpine Valley and Mare Orientale, a large and relatively young impact crater whose center lay beyond the western rim of the visible face of the moon.

May 9: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., and Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller testified on Apollo project reprogramming before the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. First “man-rated” Apollo Block II spacecraft would be delivered to ksc in late 1967 and launched three months later with Walter M. Schirra, Walter Cunningham, and Donn F. Eisele as prime crew, Webb said. Back-up crew would be Thomas P. Stafford, John W. Young, and Eugene A. Ceman. Spacecraft would still have 100%-oxygen atmosphere, but use of noncombustible and fire-resistant materials would minimize fire hazard, he asserted. “We are confident that the results of the first Block II Apollo flights will justify moving rapidly to follow-on flights, thus overcoming some of the effects of the present delay ... [so that] we can carry out this plan within the funds now available for fiscal year 1967 and in NASA’s budget for fiscal year 1968.” In order to “assure maximum progress” and reduce pressures on North American Aviation, Inc. (naa), prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, nasa was realigning its contracting arrangements, Webb said. Contracting changes included: negotiation of a new strong-incentive contract with naa for manufacture, test, and delivery of standard Block II spacecraft; extension of Boeing Co.’s present contract responsibility to include integration of command
and service module and lunar module with the Saturn booster system; selection of a third contractor to make necessary modifications to standard Apollo spacecraft produced by NAA; and consideration of offers by other aerospace companies to provide contractor assistance in Apollo systems management and check-out and test procedures.
Dr. Seamans described impact of Jan. 27 fire on Apollo schedule and budget. Lunar landing before 1970 “remains possible,” he said. “The impact . . . has been to reduce that probability, not eliminate it. . . . After the first manned Block II flight on the uprated Saturn I in 1968, we plan three to four manned Saturn V missions . . . [and] in 1969 ... up to six Saturn V missions.” Resulting $75 million of additional costs through FY 1968—for materials and equipment changes, flammability testing, launch facility modifications, and spacecraft delivery rescheduling—would be absorbed within the total budget plan currently before Congress.
NASA’s responses to recommendations by Apollo 204 Review Board were outlined by Dr. Mueller: (1) bulk combustibles and other flammable materials had been replaced with flame-resistant materials, and necessary flammables stored in fireproof containers; (2) emergency procedures would be reviewed and exercised prior to each hazardous operation, and a quick-opening hatch installed for simplified egress from capsule; (3) new NASA Office of Flight Safety would be established under omsf to review and evaluate safety provisions and monitor test operations; (4) all emergency equipment had been reviewed and additions or substitutions—including installation of water fire extinguishers—made where necessary; (5) detailed design review of spacecraft communications system had been conducted and minor changes made to assure reliable operation; (6) full-scale mockup tests had been conducted to assess fire hazard and problems of gas detection and control; and (7) management and organizational changes had been instituted to clarify responsibilities and improve coordination between NASA centers and contractors.
In response to questions by Sen. Margaret C. Smith (R-Me.) regarding rating of companies in the 1961 Apollo spacecraft contract competition, Webb said that Martin Co. had been rated first, on the basis of its technical proposal, by the source evaluation board. However he, Dr. Dryden, and Dr. Seamans—considering other factors such as lower cost estimate, outstanding company performance record, overall capability offered, and experience with X—15 experimental aircraft— chose NAA as prime candidate.
Senator Smith expressed concern that the Committee was not kept informed of serious problems revealed in the Phillips Report and asked whether NASA followed any guidelines to determine when situations should be brought to the attention of the Committee. Webb replied that no such guidelines existed and indicated that he thought it unnecessary to detail the problems to the Committee since he thought that NASA could control them. Several other committee members also expressed their desire to be informed of any problems approaching the magnitude of those surrounding the Phillips Report. When Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.) continued to criticize NASA’s reluctance to make the report public, Webb offered to discuss it, in complete context, in executive session, and repeated his objection to releasing such evaluations of
contractor performance out of context. (Testimony; SBD, 5/10/67, 57-66; O’Toole, W Post, 5/10/67, Al)

•	End of the “space race” between U.S. and U.S.S.R. was nowhere in sight,
Holmes Alexander speculated in the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin: “As matters stand today, the space contest is pretty much a race between the Communist and capitalistic systems. . . . Percentagewise the Soviet government is investing 2.5 times as much of its gross national product in the moon dash as we are. Moneywise, the investment is about equal. But the Russian economy, being much more ‘managed’ than ours, permits the ordering of what our economists call an ‘internal brain drain.’ Russian consumer industries are raided in order to feed the USSR space programs, whereas . . . NASA must compete . . . [with other agencies].
“It is wishful thinking to believe that the Russians will make any substantive concessions to ease the cost of the space race. As in Vietnam, we are locked in an expensive contest against Communism. Nobody has yet found a way to the negotiation table.” (Alexander, P EB, 5/9/67)

Ryan (D-N.Y.) that Webb had “an obsession with secrecy,” Webb asserted that NASA had been exceptionally cooperative: “No program of this magnitude has ever been operated with greater public scrutiny. No agency has ever given its committees more information on what it is trying to do.” He offered to elaborate on the Phillips Report [see April 18] in closed session but declined to discuss it publicly, insisting that further public discussion would destroy close relationship between NASA and its prime Apollo spacecraft contractor.

• Prime and. backup crews for NASA’s first manned Apollo mission [see May 9] told a news conference at North American Aviation, Inc.’s Downey, Calif., plant that they were “very impressed” with the design changes being made in the Apollo spacecraft as a result of the Jan. 27 flash fire. Major changes included: (1) a new hinged hatch that could be opened outward in about two seconds by activating a springed lever; (2)
replacement of many highly flammable materials such as nylon netting; (3) sheathing of open wiring with hard panels; and (4) flame-resistant spacesuits. In addition, spacecraft would be pressurized with nitrogen rather than oxygen on launching, and in orbit—where oxygen is indispensable—pressure would be reduced one third to 5 psi.
Questioned about his attitudes toward the program since the Jan. 27 Apollo accident, Command Pilot Walter M. Schirra replied:	. . we
went through a very agonizing self-appraisal; we suffered through three months of recrimination; we’ve culminated these three months with some very firm ideas.” These ideas, Schirra said, were being phased into an orderly program that “will continue—with orderly haste . . . [and] we are not going to run rampant on schedules.” The crews anticipated that Apollo 101 spacecraft would be delivered to ksc in December and that first manned mission would be flown in first quarter of 1968. Primary mission objective would be to “exercise the vehicle in earth orbit,” Schirra said. Asked if the April 24 death of Soviet Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov had had any adverse effects on plans for earth landings in the Apollo program, Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford replied: “The earth landing system that consists of the three main parachutes and the two drogue chutes- had been qualified completely. . . . We still have some earth landing drops to be made. But right now as far as the crew is concerned, either the parachutes in this vehicle are qualified or we don’t fly.” (Transcript; Newsweek, 5/22/67, 94; Hill, NYT, 5/11/67,27)

Recognizing the value of institutions who provide graduate education, he said: “There is little further room to doubt that a high level of basic research, an intellectual activity that must be closely associated with graduate education, is indispensable to an advancing front of scientific knowledge. . . .”
Webb referred to a June 1957 speech of J. S. McDonnell of St. Louis who had made predictions to graduating students at Rolla’s Missouri School of Mines. Prediction No. 1 had a satellite circling earth and moon
in 12 years. Webb said accomplishment was completed in three months for earth and in two years for moon. Prediction No. 2 had a satellite circling earth and Mars in 23 years. Webb said this was accomplished in seven years. Prediction No. 3 had manned space flight in earth orbit in 33 years. Webb pointed out this was done in four years.
Webb continued: “If we look backward, we can easily see that it took 37 years to conquer the earth’s oceans ... by the Caravelle sailing vessel [and] after that 37 years, the mind of man was never the same again. Control of the earth’s ocean avenues by England through the maintenance of a favorable balance of ocean technology was a predominant force for stability in the affairs of men for over 400 years [but] no clear favorable balance of air technology was held by any one nation long enough to create world stability. It was, in fact, a predominant force in the affairs of men for less than 60 years. Space technology will be a dominant force far longer than was the case for those of ocean and air. Not limited as was the ship to the water or the airplane to the air, or by international boundaries, or to the fuel that its tanks can carry, spacecraft are today unlimited tools to explore and measure the environment within which the earth itself moves and has its being.” (Text)

The accident has taken a toll in morale and in momentum within the program . . . [but] that momentum will be regained and NASA will emerge stronger. I intend to support NASA in its requests for manpower and funds to get on with the important job.” (Text)

Former afsc Commander Gen. Bernard A. Schriever (usaf, Ret.) charged that the Johnson Administration was not “pushing technology”
and suggested that $400-700 million more should have been spent annually on exploratory and advanced development during the past four or five years. He was particularly critical of the “arbitrary separation of space activities into peaceful and military. ... It simply serves to emphasize, by comparison, the straightforwardness of the Soviet program. Their single-purpose program seeks only to attain a versatile technological superiority which, once attained, will serve the political purpose they choose regardless of what kind of a space program we have or how we categorize it. . . .” (Text)
Anglo-French Concorde supersonic aircraft, scheduled to enter commercial service in 1971, would pioneer three markets, monopolizing the first two until “pushed away” by U.S. SST, scheduled to enter passenger service in 1974-5, W. J. Jakimiuk, president of Sud-Aviation, predicted. Concorde would dominate the North Atlantic market where SSTs would first be used; however, “as soon as the U.S. sst penetration of the North Atlantic pushes away the Concordes, they will be introduced on the major other markets, where a position of monopoly again will be found,” Jakimiuk said. When U.S. SST “pushes” Concorde away from these routes, it would then move to a new series of routes where traffic density would be so low that “there will be no sst competition.” (NYT, 5/21/67, 88)

•	Technique for predicting solar flares by the positions of the planets was
described by Rex Pay in Technology Week. Predictions were made by calculating time rate of change of the gravitational field at sun’s surface, taking into account local areas of persistent solar activity and their alignment with respect to earth. “Principal influences on rate of change of the gravitational field at the solar surface are the planets. Although their gravitational effects are many orders of magnitude less than that of the Sun itself, the time rate of change of the resultant planetary field vector appears to have some triggering effect on the release of solar flares. It appears, therefore, that solar flares can be predicted from the positions of the planets.” Dr. Richard Head, erc, told Technology Week that technique had been used to predict intense proton storm in late August 1966 which occurred shortly after NASA’s Lunar Orbiter I had completed its photographic mission.

•	SST program recommended by the Johnson Administration could seriously
weaken the Nation’s balance of payments, Institute for Defense Analyses (ida) concluded in report prepared for and released by FAA.

May 23: Science press briefing on Surveyor III was held at NASA Headquarters.
Dr. Ronald F. Scott, Cal Tech, showed a movie composed of a time-lapse sequence of still pictures of the surface sampler digging a small lunar trench. The device also picked up a small rock in left side of scoop and tried unsuccessfully to crush it, exerting between 200-300 psi. Dr. Scott concluded that rock examined was at least harder than sandstone, which would have broken under impact of about 200 lbs. Surveyor III also confirmed that moon’s surface could support manned lunar landing. Consistency of surface was found to be comparable to wet sand with bearing strength between three and eight psi. Dr. Scott said of an exploring astronaut: “He’ll leave a definite footprint, that’s all.”
Dr. Eugene Shoemaker, U.S. Geological Survey, said a series of 50 color photos taken by Surveyor Ill’s cameras using color filters indicated that lunar surface was gray. “The gray varies in shade from a pale to a very dark gray, but it appears to be basically all gray.” He said this color probably resulted from lack of moisture and of air on moon. Minerals on earth were brightly colored because of higher state of oxidation possible under earth environment. Dr. Shoemaker noted that some of the lunar material photographed by Surveyor III was very dark, suggesting that it had been coated with a darkening substance which he nicknamed “lunar varnish.”

earth was depicted as a dark circle sitting between spacecraft and sun. Earth appeared to have partial halo of deep sunset color in one photo and orange areas connected by a faint purple halo in the other. (O’Toole, W Post, 5/24/67, A12; Clark, NYT, 5/24/67, 50; Hines, W Star, 5/25/67, A13)
•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb, speaking at colloquium on “Urban
Government in the Decade Ahead,” at Fels Institute of Local and State Government, Pennsylvania Univ., discussed urban American goals and the urban society: “What can one say about the use of new scientific approaches for governing such a complex [society] ?”
Referring to earth-orbiting spacecraft achieving dynamic equilibrium in their mastery of space, he asked if the “ability of the human mind” could translate this concept of dynamic equilibrium into an entirely new way of thinking. Webb stated: “Here I believe we do have something to learn from the perspective the earth satellite gives us [and] if we continue to expose this kind of overview to the largest possible number of able minds, there can be little doubt that new knowledge, new capability, new perception of worthwhile and quite specific goals will emerge.” He added: “. . . I believe that what the space frontier opened up in 1957 is the kind of frontier on which pioneers can experiment and learn to use many facets of modern technology here on earth—here in America’s cities. In urban America, as elsewhere, men need the constant development of new concepts of reality and the inspiration that comes from a chance to better know this city and this universe in which we live.” (Text)
•	First SV-5D lifting body vehicle ever recovered from a suborbital space
flight was displayed by usaf at Pentagon press briefing. Seven feet long and weighing 860 lbs, it was heat-blackened and slightly charred on its outer surface from 3,000° F reentry heat. Col. Curtis L. Scoville, afsc, said vehicle, launched April 19 by an Atlas booster, had achieved an orbital speed of 17,000 mph and reentered in a maneuvering descent that took it “hundreds of miles” off its straight-line trajectory. A USAF aircraft recovered it in mid-air during final parachute descent. Mission was third successful flight in usaf’s Precision Recovery Including Maneuvering Entry (prime) program; first two vehicles were not recovered, but program was considered so successful that planned fourth flight had been canceled.

May 26—31: 27th Paris International Air and Space Show at Le Bourget Airport was opened 'by French President Charles de Gaulle, who toured the French, British, U.S., and U.S.S.R. exhibits. More than 450 aerospace companies representing 16 countries participated in the show. Exhibits in U.S. pavilion traced the progress of aviation during the 40 yrs since May 20-21, 1927, when Charles A. Lindbergh flew from New York to Paris, becoming the first man to fly the Atlantic non-stop alone. Included were: (1) a replica of Lindbergh’s aircraft, “The Spirit of St. Louis”; (2) Douglas Aircraft Co.’s DC-8 Super 63, world’s largest commercial jet aircraft; (3) SV-5J, first manned jet lifting body vehicle; (4) usaf F—111A swing-wing jet fighter; and (5) models of NASA’s Lunar Orbiter, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft. Soviet exhibit featured first public display of Vostok booster, similar to the one used to launch Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on world’s first manned space flight April 12,1961.
On May 29, Cosmonaut Pavel Belyayev entered the Apollo spacecraft during a visit to the U.S. pavilion and discussed the instruments, levers, and buttons inside the spacecraft with Astronaut David Scott. Belyayev was first Soviet cosmonaut ever to have entered a U.S. spacecraft.

May 27: Venus is devoid of water and, therefore, of life, Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, Univ, of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, told New York Times reporter Richard D. Lyons in a telephone interview. “We now know that Venus is a dead planet. The astronomical literature is full of references to water clouds and ice crystals. These two things are definitely wrong. The complete absence of water means that the chemistry of Venus is totally different from the chemistry here.” Practical absence of water in the Venus atmosphere provided new information on the constitution of the planet, Dr. Kuiper said: “It is probable now that the Venus clouds are dust and that a substantial fraction of the high surface temperature must be attributed to internal heat reaching the planet’s surface through a thin solid crust.” Dr. Kuiper’s conclusions were based on astronomical observations made May 13 from a specially fitted NASA-owned Convair 990 jet aircraft which flew at
37,000-ft altitude over Canada. His theory conflicted with one set forth in 1966 by Johns Hopkins Univ. astrophysicists Drs. William Plummer and John Strong that surface temperatures of Venus were low enough to support life in certain areas.

Webb said at the Celebration of The
Prelude to Independence in Williamsburg, Va. “It is the essential requirement for each of us to do what we can as individuals and as groups to make our system of representative government work, and then work better. More and more this means that each of us must find a way to reach through complexity and organized prejudice to trusted sources of information and organized facts. We must not do less than to make sure we understand the fundamentals in the many important disciplines of human activity. Without this understanding of at least the fundamentals . . . today’s citizen cannot play the role only he can play in representative society, cannot bridge the gap from the old to the new, from one discipline to another. Without this capability, a citizen today cannot be a fully effective participant in a free society. Indeed, without this basic understanding on a large scale at all levels our nation is likely to forfeit the capability of collectively responsible action, and with it, the basis for an effective free society. . . .” (Text)

It noted some of Webb’s accomplishments as NASA Administrator: “. . . Webb has steered steadily growing budgets—from $l-billion in 1961 to this year’s $5-billion—among the Congressional reefs. He runs a NASA organization of nearly 35,000 people in 16 facilities that stretch from Boston to Cape Kennedy, from Houston to the West Coast—and a worldwide network of tracking stations. At the same time, he has had to deal directly or indirectly with nearly 21,000 contracting companies, which employ about 400,000 people. . . .” Article concluded that Webb had been “bruised, not beaten” by the controversy surrounding the Apollo accident. “. . . odds-makers in Washington are betting that when the smoke clears Webb will emerge still at the helm of NASA. Further, they think NASA still may meet its deadline of a moon landing before 1970.” (B Wk, 5/27/67, 71—7)

Washington Post: “President Johnson made the right decision in requesting that Congress appropriate Federal funds for the development of the supersonic transport plane. . . . But in proposing what it calls ‘a creative partnership between our Government and American industry,’ the Administration should provide more adequate protection for the taxpayer who will bear a substantial share of the development costs.
“Why should not the taxpayers, who are to provide about 25 per cent of the capital required, be permitted to share proportionately in the enormous profits that would be earned by a successful SST? Although it is necessary to launch the sst project with the shortest possible delay, Congress should be concerned with a more adequate protection of the public interest.” (W Post, 5/1/67)
World Journal Tribune: “Actually, the basis of the SST project is coldly commercial. At stake is not some vague blue ribbon of achievement but American leadership in the highly profitable business of supplying planes to the world’s airlines.
“sst, by its size, speed and sonic boom, will cause a number of pro'b-
lems which have not yet been solved. But it was inevitable that this country should enter the supersonic race—not for national pride or out of scientific curiosity, but as a matter of good business.
“The international plane market is too good for America to let it go by default.” (WJT, 5/4/67,22)

Berkner: “In every generation there are a few men whose personal careers reflect with precision the great changes that have come over the country in their lifetime. Lloyd Viel Berkner built his first radio transmitter as a schoolboy in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, and in 1928 he joined an expedition to the South Pole. Three decades later he emerged as one of the most effective advocates of American exploration in space.
“In those years American science had become a vast interwoven fabric of academic and Federal laboratories, foundations and private corporations, civilian operations and military operations. Mr. Berkner moved in this world, which he had signally helped to create, not only as a scientist of distinction but as an organizer and manager of extraordinary force and capacity. . .

•	A manned Apollo spacecraft should be launched to recover Explorer 1,
first U.S. satellite, whose orbit was expected to decay in late 1969, G. Snowden of Melbourne, Australia, suggested in a Letter to the Editor of Aviation Week. “When Apollo swings into action, maybe one of the tasks could be a rendezvous and retrieval of man’s first satellite. I say first because Sputnik 1 and 2 have decayed, leaving Explorer 1 at the head of the list. A replica can be built at a fraction of the cost of retrieval, but there is nothing like having the original. Not only would it have value as a historic memento of man’s venture into space, but also to scientists. I am certain after nearly 10 years in space it would be valuable to them. . . .” (Av Wk, 6/5/67, 110)

Institution’s Langley Medal by Dr. Fred L. Whipple, Director of Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, in Washington, D.C., ceremony. Dr. von Braun was cited in “recognition of his creative vision of the practical application of rocket power to space flight leading to the first U.S. satellite, and of his technical leadership in development of the Saturn class of large launch vehicles upon which the Apollo moon flight is based.” He was the 13th recipient of the award, which was established in 1908 to commemorate the aeronautical achievements of Samuel Pierpont Langley, third Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Other recipients included Orville and Wilbur Wright, Charles A. Lindbergh, Robert H. Goddard (posthumously), Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, and Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr.
In making the presentation, Dr. Whipple said U.S. could have launched the world’s first satellite if it had endorsed the proposal which he and Dr. von Braun developed in 1954 to launch small spacecraft from the equator
using existing rockets. Government decision to fund, instead, usn’s Vanguard project, allowed U.S.S.R. to win “the first space race.” (Text; Smithsonian Release; Marshall Star, 6/7/67, 1; AP, NYT, 6/6/67. 3)

Karth ... by speaking out . . . was the ‘tool’ chosen by the administration to do a public relations job for NASA and the space program. . . .
“What Mr. Hines failed to say was that Congressman Karth has led a number of hard-hitting congressional space investigations over the years for me. Both NASA and the contractors involved were ‘taken to the woodshed.’ The Apollo program is no exception. Mr. Karth has been critical—and made it clear that the accident responsibility falls squarely on NASA and the contractor.
“Very simply, Mr. Karth said that perhaps the Congress, the administration and the press could do a better job of giving the public objective information on the space program. The wide swings from ‘everything is great’ to ‘everything is wrong’ must be confusing. . . .” (W Star, 6/6/67, A12)

Mueller outlined Apollo Applications (aa) program at aiaa meeting in Washington, D.C. Series of innovations would be made, he said, to permit sufficient reductions in unit costs: (1) reuse of Command Module (cm) ; (2) addition of land-landing capability which would facilitate CM reuse, permit increase in crew capacity, and, possibly, make use of naval recovery forces unnecessary; (3) “double use” of Uprated Saturn I’s 2nd stage as booster during launch phase and as Orbital Workshop in space; (4) repeated use of Orbital Workshop as an embryonic space station; (5) longer-duration flights of one year or more; and (6) use of Apollo flight hardware and physical plant and employment of Apollo program officials and industrial organizations as they become available.
“. . . this is a program that provides for a detailed measurement of the utility of man in space at a relatively low cost. The measurement is obtained by doing useful things—astronomical observation, extended exploration of the moon and experiments with sensing equipment that can lead to benefits of enormous significance to all mankind.” (Text)

June 7: Launch of the first manned Apollo mission by March 31, 1968, “is a very difficult milestone to achieve, but it is possible,” George M. Low, Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program at msc, told the press at msc. All changes in the Apollo spacecraft necessitated by the Jan. 27 Apollo fire had been planned, he said, but until daily scheduling was completed, no date could be set for the mission. Low noted that Apollo parachute landing system might require requalification because design changes had increased spacecraft’s weight by 200-300 lbs, but he indicated that testing, if necessary, could be conducted in summer 1967 without seriously affecting the Apollo schedule.

•	Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) warned the Senate that U.S. deficit could
reach $30 billion unless drastic cuts were made in Federal spending. He suggested that a $5-billion reduction in proposed FY 1968 spending be made by: (1) postponing public works programs such as highway construction until economic and military demands were lowered; (2) foregoing the “expensive frill” of sst development; (3) curtailing military costs by further reducing U.S. troop strength in Europe; and (4) cutting NASA’s post-Apollo funds by over $1 billion by postponing “such projects as a soft-landing on Mars, which has nothing to do with our present goal of a moon landing.
“The situation that we face in fiscal 1968 involves an economy dominated by a heavy Federal budget, no matter how it is measured. If these circumstances materialize, there is no question about the immediate urgency of substantial expenditure reductions. . . . We may need a tax increase too, but first priority by all means should go to the reduction of spending.” (Text)

June 14: NASA’s Mariner V (Mariner E) spacecraft was successfully launched from etr by Atlas-Agena D booster on four-month, 212-million-mi Venus flyby mission—NASA’s only attempt to conduct a Venus flyby during the 1967 launch window. Agena stage separated from Atlas on schedule and ignited to reach 115-mi (185-km)-altitude parking orbit, where it coasted for 13 min before reigniting to inject spacecraft onto transfer trajectory toward Venus. Spacecraft then separated from Agena, deployed its four solar panels, and locked its sensors on the sun and the star Canopus. Midcourse maneuver was successfully conducted June 19 to assure that spacecraft would fly to within 2,500 mi of Venus Oct. 19. [U.S.S.R.’s Venus IV, launched June 12, was expected to reach Venus around same time.]
June 14: NASA’s Mariner V being weigbt-tested at Cape Kennedy before its successful launch on a four-month mission to perform a close flyby of the planet Venus.
Mariner V, fifth in a series of interplanetary probes, had originally been built as a Mars probe to back up Mariner IV but was remodeled to accomplish Venus ’67 mission. Primary mission for the 540-lb spacecraft was to fly by Venus to obtain scientific data which would complement and extend data obtained by Mariner II pertaining to the origin
and nature of Venus and its environment. Spacecraft’s secondary mission was to obtain data on interplanetary environment during a period of increased solar activity and provide engineering experience in converting and operating spacecraft designed for flight to Mars into one flown to Venus. Mariner V carried automatic sensing devices to record data for derivation of radiation levels, temperatures, pressures, magnetic fields, and atmospheric density near Venus.
First Venus probe, Mariner I, was destroyed during launch July 22, 1962; second, Mariner II, was successfully launched Aug. 27, 1962, and flew within 21,600 mi of Venus Dee. 14, 1962. Mariner III, a Mars probe launched Nov. 4, 1964, failed to achieve desired orbit when shroud remained attached to spacecraft. Mariner IV was successfully launched Nov. 28, 1964, and transmitted first close-up photos of Mars in July 1965. Mariner program was directed by ossa Lunar and Planetary Programs Div.; project management and responsibility for spacecraft, mission operations, and tracking and data acquisition were assigned to JPL; and Atlas-Agena launch vehicle was managed by Lewis Research Center, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 67-124)

June 22: Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences voted to report $4,851 billion NASA authorization bill (S. 1296)—$249 million less than $5.1 billion NASA had requested for FY 1968. Committee reductions included $120 million from Apollo Applications (aa) program and $71.5 million—total amount requested—from Voyager program. Responding to Committee report, NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., issued a statement saying that the affected programs were of “first-rank importance to mankind. The scientists of this country have expressed deep concern that the United States is not making enough progress in the exploration of the planets.

•	House completed general debate on NASA FY 1968 authorization bill
(H.R. 10340) and was scheduled to resume discussion of bill June 27 when amendments would be considered and final vote taken. During debate Rep. Delbert L. Latta (R-Ohio) criticized the $444.7 million recommended by Committee on Science and Astronautics for the Apollo Applications (aa) program: “. . . we could spend [that money] toward research and possible cure of cancer, stroke, and heart disease, rather than some nebulous undefined program that will take place when—and I emphasize this point—and after we get to the moon. This money is to be spent on hardware after we get to the moon. No one knows when we are going to get there . . . [and] if we spend this money perfecting these vehicles and this hardware today, it might be out of date when we get to the moon. . . .” Rep. Olin Teague (D-Tex.), Chairman of House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Subcom-
mittee on Manned Space Flight, defended the 8444.7-million recommendation. “The manned space flight program—Apollo, Apollo applications and advanced manned missions—drives the Apollo effort into its final phases and begins the work of realizing benefits for man on earth. It supports national security, fosters national growth, expands knowledge, and retains options for the future at a cost the country can well afford. To delay this program is, in effect, to cancel it. Such a decision would put the space plum in the hands of the Soviet Union. . . .” (nasa lar V/68; OR, 6/22/67, H7782, H7797)

Dr. Herbert Friedman, Superintendent of Naval Research Laboratory’s Atmospheric and Astrophysics Div., announced at news conference in Washington, D.C. Rocket experiment, he said: (1) provided first evidence that x rays were produced as far away as the “rim” of the universe; (2) detected quasars, previously detectable only by their radio waves or by visible light seen through high-power telescopes; (3) lent support to theory that universe is saturated with background radiation from explosion of universe 10 billion yrs ago; and (4) detected three new x-ray sources, apparently outside our galaxy and not traceable to any known object. These findings, Dr. Friedman said, indicated that x-ray astronomy had “come of age” as a tool to explore the universe. To explore x-ray sources further, he suggested installing x-ray detection equipment on proposed satellites such as NASA’s orbital workshop and launching larger equipment for longer periods of time to map the whole sky for x-ray sources.

•	nasa Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications Dr.
Homer E. Newell and ossa Director of Space Applications Programs Leonard Jaffe discussed impact of space research on science and technology in Science. As a result of space research, they said, science and technology could contribute to the arts by furnishing new media for human expression; enrich the humanities hy furnishing new media for broader basis for understanding himself and his place in nature; provide the historian with a better approach to history because of scientific methodology; and enable archeologists more accurately to date materials and identify their sources.
As the entire world “absorbs the increased understanding of man and nature that science generates, and reflects that understanding in its literature, its social, political, and economic institutions, and its application to human daily living ... it may be hoped that this common bond will . . . give increased motivation to solve peaceably the problems that beset the world . . . [and] provide increased means for doing so. . . . To use properly and effectively these powerful tools of our times is an inescapable challenge to men and governments the world over.” (Newell, Jaffe, Science, 7/1/61, 29-39)

July 8—9: The 1967 Soviet air show—first in six years—was held at Domodedovo Airport near Moscow. Program included aerial displays and ground exhibits of seven new types of supersonic jet fighters, including one vtol and two variable-sweep-wing aircraft similar to U.S. F—111; Proton and Vostok spacecraft; World War II fighters; and four-engine IL-62 commercial aircraft. U.S.S.R. claimed that its new variable-sweep-wing models—a fighter and a missile launcher—were first and lightest in the world and could fly at mach 1 at sea level and mach 2 at higher altitudes. New vtol aircraft was reportedly capable of rising vertically 130-160 ft before beginning forward flight. Western sources speculated that absence of any large new bombers suggested that U.S.S.R., like U.S., was concentrating on versatile missile-launching aircraft which had long-range striking power.

July 9: usn decision to study a ship-based antimissile missile system [see July 3] was praised by Hanson Baldwin in the New York Times. “Strategically and tactically the role of the Navy has been transformed by the nuclear age; the depths of the sea, the space above the atmosphere and every part of every land mass on earth are now accessible to modern naval power.” Proposed sabmis system would be especially effective because:
(1)	nuclear submarines’ ability to remain completely submerged indefinitely gave them unequaled defense invulnerability; (2) submarine-launched ballistic missile would draw enemy attack toward seas rather than toward populated land as land-based missiles do; (3) sea-based system would be more effective against enemy missile containing several warheads, each capable of maneuvering along'different trajectory; and
(4)	system would be able to intercept enemy missiles in midcourse, rather than terminal phase. (Baldwin, NYT, 7/9/67)
•	Effect of sonic boom on sst flight routes and sales prospects was discussed
by Secretary of Transportation Alan S. Boyd, FAA Administrator William
F.	McKee, and Director of sst Development b/g J. C. Maxwell (usaf, Ret.) in May and June testimony released by House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on the Dept, of Transportation. Conditions under which supersonic flight would be permitted over populated land areas had still not been determined, Gen. Maxwell explained. “The available sonic boom data indicate that the present sst design may possibly be restricted from supersonic operations over populated land areas . . . [and we] have based our sst program decisions on the conservative assumption that this design will be operated primarily on water.”
dot did not have to force the American public to tolerate sonic booms to make sst program an economic success, Secretary Boyd assured the Committee. “We are satisfied that we can have a . . . highly successful
program, assuming the sonic boom is intolerable over populated areas. ... The only thing that is involved here is whether we sell more aircraft, not whether the program is a success. . . .” Even if sst were limited to subsonic flight over inhabited areas at least 300 aircraft could be sold initially, he said, and market studies indicated “that there is a possibility of going up to 1,200 aircraft by 1990.” (Transcript, 41, 294, 942)

July 10-13: Accelerated space effort by dod was discussed in four-part Long
Island Newsday series by AP writer Howard Benedict, U.S., he said, was quietly developing a strong military space capability because: (1) U.S.S.R. “is vigorously pushing for a military space capability”;
(2)	Titan II and Minuteman missiles “are threatened by new warhead guidance system 10 times more accurate than any previous system”;
(3)	Polaris missiles deployed at sea “are threatened by new satellite reconnaissance devices” that may soon be able to locate submerged submarines; (4) U.S. missiles designed to penetrate Soviet defenses were threatened by potential Soviet capability to neutralize and destroy them before they reached enemy territory; and (5) “world strategic situation has been changed sharply by Red Chinese achievements in nuclear explosives and by steadily decreasing costs which will permit other nations to deploy missile forces.”
DOD was developing “fantastic” weapons and military equipment, Benedict noted: “reconnaissance satellites that will spot a soldier hiding in underbrush or a missile buried underground; satellites to locate submerged submarines; communications satellites that will enable infantrymen ... to converge on strategy; rockets to knock down enemy satellites; laser and radiation beams to pulverize space or ground targets; rocket-borne nuclear bombs to destroy missile warhead rockets with great power and versatility; and manned spaceships that will take off and land like conventional airplanes.” U9AF’s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (mol) program, he said, would determine whether man is more effective at performing tasks currently done by unmanned satellites and whether space itself could become a battlefield.

Schriever (usaf, Ret.), found that U.S. had “exchanged its goal of a war-winning strategic superiority for a strategy of mutual deterrence” while U.S.S.R. “is driving hard toward a goal of overwhelming superiority. . . .” Report predicted that by 1971 U.S.S.R. would have a 30,000- to 50,000-mt nuclear delivery capability, contrasting with 6,000- to 15,000-mt for U.S., and recommended a rapid arms buildup or development of an antiballistic missile system. It warned that “by placing our sole reliance for deterrence on iCBMs, POLARIS and POSEIDON missiles, and the remaining manned bomber force . . . [U.S.] places itself in the dangerous position of having only one option left if it is faced with a Soviet ultimatum to surrender. It must either fire its offensive nuclear weapons or give up its sovereignty.

•	NASA was studying feasibility of launching two navigation satellites to
keep SST under constant surveillance and be alert to slightest malfunction, Mohammed Rauf, Jr., reported in the News American. NASA Chief of Navigation and Traffic Control Eugene Ehrlich, who conceived the plan, told Rauf in an interview that the system would provide maximum safety against accidents: “The program calls for the building of two
tracking stations on each side of the Atlantic. The wings of the plane and all its other important parts will be fitted with small transponders, which will continually relay information about the plane’s condition to' the satellites . . . [which would] relay the signals to the tracking stations, where giant computers will process them within minutes for appropriate action.” Eventually, Ehrlich predicted, all aircraft and ships would be equipped with transponders “because the [proposed] navigation satellites . . . will be capable of handling the increasing amount of air and sea traffic predicted for this century.

July 14-16: NASA’s Surveyor IV (Surveyor D) was successfully launched from ETR by Atlas-Centaur booster (AC—11) on an excellent 65-hr lunar-intercept trajectory, but mission ended prematurely when communications with spacecraft were lost seconds before it was scheduled to softland on the moon. The abrupt termination of the spacecraft’s signal made it impossible to determine whether spacecraft had landed safely or crashed out of control.
Launched by the last direct-ascent (single-burn) Centaur vehicle in Surveyor program, 2,290-lb Surveyor IV performed all required sequences on schedule, including a midcourse maneuver which narrowed estimated target miss from 124 mi to 2.4 mi. Landing sequence began as planned when spacecraft shifted its normal cruising attitude to position main retrorocket downward toward moon. Radio contact was lost two seconds before retrorocket ended its planned 42-sec burn to slow
spacecraft’s speed from 5,900 mph to 350 mph. Repeated attempts to reestablish radio contact with spacecraft failed.
Surveyor IV carried photographic equipment, a surface sampler, and a magnetic device on one of its footpads to test for magnetic materials in the lunar soil. Primary mission objectives: (1) to softland on the moon in the Sinus Medii and (2) to obtain TV photos of the lunar surface. Secondary objectives: (1) to conduct a vernier engine experiment;
(2)	to manipulate lunar surface with surface sampler in view of TV camera; (3) to obtain touchdown dynamics data; and (4) to obtain thermal and radar reflectivity data on lunar surface. Target zone in the Sinus Medii was almost in the exact center of moon’s visible hemisphere and was rougher than the Ocean of Storms where Surveyor I and Surveyor III had landed. Benjamin Milwitzky, NASA Surveyor Program Manager, said the site was so rugged that spacecraft had only a 50-50 chance of landing intact. “But this region is extremely important to Apollo and that’s why we’re going there.”
Surveyor IV was fourth in series of seven spacecraft in NASA’s Surveyor program: Surveyor I (launched May 30, 1966) and Surveyor III (launched April 17, 1967) both softlanded successfully and transmitted photos to earth; Surveyor II (launched Sept. 20, 1966) did not soft-land because of ignition failure in one of its three vernier engines.

•	Congressional reaction to the FY 1968 space budget pointed up the need
for the Johnson Administration to “take a fresh, hard look at shaping a truly national space program” in the 1970s, Michael Getler suggested in Aerospace Technology. “What we have now, on one hand, is the already big and expensive civilian space program which, though enormously successful and of great importance to national technological strength, is unfortunately vulnerable to on-again/off-again Congressional support and to the continuing challenge of finding dramatic new undertakings which can attract the necessary backing.
“On the other hand, we now have a rapidly growing military space program which appears to be on its firmest footing and which has demonstrated an ability to request and get new funds even when dollars are very tight. . .
There were many areas where the two programs should remain separate, Getler said, but there were also many areas where cooperation would be advantageous: “Rather than representing a loss of funding, we believe that joint development [in some areas] will lend stability to programs that might otherwise run into trouble as single agency undertakings, will lend more logic to the national commitment to space, and end some of the sniping about parallelism that has hurt in the past. . . .” .

Nigel Calder, in Science, cited views of Univ. of Illinois physicist S. A. Bowhill: “The F-region of the ionosphere is now becoming fairly well understood, and the outstanding problems are yielding to theoretical treatment. The new explanations often involve large-scale movements of charged particles in the upper atmosphere. Attention will now turn to lower layers (the D-region and below) where recent studies indicate unexpected interactions between the ionosphere and the stratosphere.” (Calder, Science, 8/11/67, 666-8)

•	Astronauts on long-duration space flights might have to accept greater ra-
diation exposure than the amount considered safe for industrial workers and, in some cases, this additional exposure could heighten the risk of cancer and shorten life expectancy, nrc’s Space Science Board concluded in report entitled Radiobiological Factors in Manned Space Flight. Board recommended that criteria different from those used in industry be set up to gauge radiation risks in space flight and to decide what was acceptable. “Manned space flights are high risk endeavors. They take place in a hostile environment that cannot be permitted to encroach beyond the limits of human endurance if the missions are to succeed.” Report noted, however, that radiation was “only one of many recognized and accepted potential risks” to space flight and shielding against it added weight to the spacecraft. Consequently, protection against radiation had to be balanced against other needs vital to the success of the mission, (nrc Release; Schmeck, NYT, 7/18/67, 38M; Reistrup, W Post, 7/18/67, A3; AP, WStar, 7/18/67, A3)

•	Sen. Joseph S. Clark (D-Pa.), speaking on the Senate floor, urged Presi-
dent Johnson to appoint a commission to study the need for construction and deployment of an antiballistic missile (abm) system. “. . . the ABM question is of such a magnitude that it is essential to have a careful and objective evaluation of the course the United States should follow. I do not believe . . . that the military-industrial complex is objective enough to advise the United States Congress or the President on how we should proceed. This being the case, I strongly suggest that a temporary blue ribbon commission drawn from all sectors of national life is the best way to bring a thorough- inquiry into the issues.

•	NASA investigative board concluded that immediate cause of the M2—F2
lifting body vehicle crash at Edwards afb May 10 was “an unusually low landing flare maneuver and premature ground contact” resulting from an unusual set of circumstances “that individually would not have ended in an accident.” These circumstances were: (1) “Pilot was overburdened in his normally exacting task by a combination of events that dis-
oriented and distracted him and denied him normal height information; (2) The large amplitude roll oscillation during final approach . . . caused a temporary loss of lateral control . . . and changed the landing heading”; (3) presence of rescue helicopter near path of landing heading represented a collision potential; (4) lack of visual height cues in landing area; and (5) unavoidable absence of radioed attitude callouts from chase aircraft. Board recommended: (1) easing pilot workloads in landing lifting-body vehicles; (2) maintaining an enlarged cleared area where inadvertent landings might occur; and (3) improving the information flow on flight planning, briefing, and monitoring procedures.

During July: Editorial comment on proposed NASA FY 1968 authorization bills [see June 28]:
Science: “The political atmosphere surrounding the U.S. space program is today murkier and less hospitable than at any time since 1961 when President Kennedy'decided to send men to the moon. This does not necessarily mean that nasa is in any danger of falling off its $5-billion-a-year budgetary plateau . . . [but] it is clear that, where Congress is concerned, the agency has lost much of its innocence and therefore its plans are to be reviewed with caution and skepticism.
“Some members of Congress are remarkably frank in indicating that their principal interest in the space program lies in the economic benefits it brings their districts. . . . Indeed, one might be justified in predicting that the major budgetary struggles of the future will be less concerned with how much money nasa gets than with how NASA spends the money it does get.” (Carter, Science, 7/14/67, 170-3)
Washington Evening Star: “If continuity and momentum are to be maintained in the space program . . . the [congressional] conferees must act with special wisdom this year.
“Two . . . items in the House bill should be embodied in one final version. . . . One would establish an independent safety panel in nasa, and the other would require . . . [nasa] to keep Congress ‘fully and currently informed’ of problem areas in the space effort.
“Both proposals were strongly opposed by administration spokesmen on grounds that seem shallow and legalistic. It would be well to embody both in the final 1968 authorization bill, if only to put NASA on firm notice that it is time to shape up.” (W Star, 7/7/67, A16)
New York Times: “To read the record of the Congressional debate on NASA’s budget is a melancholy experience. . . . Behind the rhetoric it was easy to see the pressure of the many corporations and commu-
nities now sharing in nasa’s largeness and fearful of the impact of any maj or cut in this flow of golden manna. . . .
“A rational 1968 space budget would have been substantially lower than either the House or Senate version, and would have cut particularly severely at the Apollo project. ... It would have changed the present emphasis ... to lay greater stress on the exploration of the cosmos with relatively cheap, unmanned rockets. Instead, the enormously expensive manned lunar landing effort is left virtually intact, while the highly promising program for sending unmanned Voyagers to Mars and other planets could be entirely eliminated.

to reduce operating costs by a factor of two” for the mission traffic anticipated for post-1970, G. A. Sears of the rand Corp. had concluded. His papier, Orbital Baaing: Key to Low Cost Space Operations?, compared present earth-based manned spaceflight program with concept of basing spacecraft at manned space station. Spacecraft would be injected into mission orbits as required and later rejuvenated for reuse by rendezvous with station. Spacecraft would have to operate nearly coplanar with base, a constraint acceptable to many but not all low-orbit missions; however, as method of reducing costs, orbital basing “deserves attention on a par with recovery-to-earth and reuse and extended-life concepts,” Sears stated.

August 1967
August 1: nasa’s Lunar Orbiter V (Lunar Orbiter E) unmanned spacecraft was successfully launched by Atlas-Agena D booster from etr on mission to photograph the lunar surface [see Aug. 5-27].
Agena 2nd stage fired to boost 860-lb spacecraft into parking orbit of 100-mi (161-km) altitude, reignited after 30-min coast period to inject spacecraft on 89-hr translunar trajectory, and separated. On schedule, Lunar Orbiter V deployed its four solar panels and two antennas and locked its five sensors on the sun. On Aug. 2 the star tracker encountered slight difficulty in locating Canopus because of “glint” from the sun and “earthshine,” but obtained a fix at 18:34 get, before midcourse maneuver. At 06:00 on Aug. 3 midcourse maneuver with 26-sec engine burn was successfully conducted to slow spacecraft’s speed and alter its aiming point slightly.
Primary objectives of NASA’s Lunar Orbiter V mission were: (1) to place three-axis-stabilized spacecraft into high-inclination lunar orbit; and (2) to obtain photography of selected scientifically interesting areas on lunar surface and supplemental photography of candidate Apollo lunar landing sites. Photos would cover five Apollo sites, 36 scientific sites, and areas of the moon’s hidden side previously unphotographed. Spacecraft would also provide precision trajectory information to refine definition of lunar gravitational field, monitor micrometeoroids and radiation intensity in lunar environment, and serve as a target for tracking operations by Manned Space Flight Network stations.
Last in series of five spacecraft designed to improve knowledge of the moon, Lunar Orbiter V differed from four earlier missions because it would concentrate on targets of primary interest to science. Lunar Orbiter I (launched Aug. 10, 1966), Lunar Orbiter II (launched Nov. 6,
1966)	, and Lunar Orbiter III (launched Feb. 4, 1967) were in direct support of Apollo and Surveyor programs, identifying at least eight areas suitable for manned landings. Lunar Orbiter IV (launched May 4,
1967)	completed broad photographic survey of 99% of moon’s front face with 10 times finer resolution than best existing telescopic views. Lunar Orbiter program was managed by LaRC under ossa direction. Tracking and communications were the responsibility of jPL-operated Deep Space Network, (nasa Proj OS; nasa Release 67—192)

French military and civil officials immediately began an investigation to determine whether a sonic boom had been responsible for the accident. The New York Times later commented: “The latest discoveries about sonic boom . . . provide scant comfort for enthusiasts of supersonic commercial air transports.
“Further research will undoubtedly turn up additional useful information, but by now the results of several years’ investigation of this phenomenon are beginning to fall into a pattern. In a world where everyone

was healthy and vigorous, where all buildings were relatively new and well constructed, sonic booms would be just one more source of annoyance and frayed nerves among the many such ‘blessings’ modern civilization and technology have produced. But in the real world—where any large community has many sick and infirm people and many old and poorly constructed buildings—sonic booms, especially if repeated frequently, pose appreciable hazards to the more fragile human beings and structures. . . .” (Hess, NYT, 8/3/67, 24; NYT, 8/3/67, 30)

Experiments performed satisfactorily, but parachute did not deploy and payload crashed because of faulty wiring. Recovery was not required to obtain scientific data. (NASA Rpt SRL)
•	Astronaut-Aquanaut M. Scott Carpenter (Cdr., usn) was detached from
NASA at usn’s request for assignment in Navy’s Deep Submergence Systems Project (dssp) . One of the Nation’s seven original astronauts, Carpenter became the second American to orbit the earth when he piloted Aurora 7 spacecraft on three-orbit mission May 24, 1962. Active in USN’s Man-in-the-Sea program since 1965, he set a world record in underwater work during Aug. 28-Oct. 10, 1965, Sealab II experiment when he lived 205 ft down in the Pacific for 30 consecutive days. Under dssp he was tentatively assigned as an aquanaut in Sealab III, a 60-day experiment 600 ft down in the Pacific scheduled to take place in 1968. As usn’s senior aquanaut, Carpenter’s duties would include responsibility for Sealab III ocean floor operations, experiments, and equipment and for coordination of aquanaut team training.
NASA Administrator James E. Webb commented on Carpenter’s departure. “. . . we are grateful to him and the United States Navy for his services over the past eight years. During the past two years, he has demonstrated that many of the technologies, techniques, and psychophysiological factors related to space flight have direct applications to the Man-in-the-Sea program. Thus, Cdr. Carpenter becomes the first astronaut to return to his parent service in order to apply the skills, knowledge, and experience acquired during his assignment to NASA. ...” (nasa Release 67—208)

•	Conclusion in Mar. 24 Science article by Bruce C. Murray of Cal Tech and
his associates about probable contamination of Mars and Venus by U.S.S.R.’s Zond 11 and Venus III received comment from Dr. Richard W. Porter, member of International Relations Committee of NRc’s Space Science Board, and from Britain’s leading radio astronomer, Sir Bernard Lovell. Murray and associates had presented information: tracking data from Jodrell Bank Experimental Station had indicated that Zond II, launched Nov. 30, 1964, had been on collision course with Mars, terminating Aug. 6, 1965; Mstislav Keldysh, President of Soviet Academy of Sciences, had said Zond II would pass within 1,448 km (900 mi) of Mars; Venus III, launched Nov. 12, 1965, may have crashlanded on Venus’ surface Mar. 1, 1966; radio communications had been main-
tained with Venus III throughout the flight hut were lost as the probe approached Venus; no telemetric data were received in final moments before impact.
In a letter to editor of Science, Porter wrote: “Their conclusion with respect to Venus is based largely on what was not said by the Soviets about sterilization of the flyby bus and on the authors’ assumption that the capsule separation and bus deflection maneuvers were not made automatically, even after loss of radio contact.” Porter said authors’ conclusion about Mars was also based on insufficient evidence and noted that in discussions with “highly placed” Soviet scientists during spring 1965, he had received impression that Zond II’s miss distance was likely to be much greater than 900 mi.
In his letter to editor of Science regarding Murray and associates’ statements on probable contamination of Mars and Venus, Sir Bernard Lovell noted that Zond II’s signals were so strong that there should have been no difficulty in tracking the probe at Mars encounter; also, miss distance of 1,500 km (932 mi) was within the accuracy of Jodrell Bank calculations. Sir Bernard Lovell would “prefer to accept the statement of the President of the [Soviet] Academy [of Sciences (Keldysh) ] about the miss distance. . . .” (Science, 3/24/67, 1505-11; 8/4/67, 487-8)

•	NASA’s selection of two foreign-born astronauts [see Aug. 4] was praised
by Erwin D. Canham in the Christian Science Monitor: “The Australian, Dr. Philip K. Chapman . . . and the Welshman, Dr. John A. Llewellyn, . . . are both naturalized Americans. They are, one may assume, part of the brain drain which has brought so many able persons to the United States in the last quarter of a century. Nothing like this flow of talent has been seen on such a scale in history before.
“The outreach of science also has become profoundly international. It is a deeper bond than we have yet recognized it to be. Someday, perhaps, it will transcend politics. That is the challenge: to bring politi-
cal institutions into line with the basic unities which are evidenced in men’s constantly changing relationship to the physical universe. . . (Canham, CSM, 8/5/67)
August 5-27: NASA’s Lunar Orbiter V became fifth U.S. spacecraft to circle the moon. It entered lunar orbit following successful deboost maneuver which reduced its speed by 1,440 mph and permitted lunar capture. Initial orbital parameters: apolune, 3,734 mi (6,023 km); perilune, 121 mi (194 km); period, 8 hrs 30 min; and inclination, 85°. Launched from etr Aug. 1, spacecraft performed 513 attitude changes, responded to 4,524 commands, and recorded one micrometeoroid hit. Spacecraft systems were functioning normally. Photographs taken beginning Aug. 6 included 23 previously unphotographed areas of the moon’s far side, first picture showing the “full earth”; 36 sites of primary interest to science; and five additional candidate Apollo landing sites. Transmitted were 212 medium- and 212 high-resolution photos. Final readout was completed Aug. 27. Mission substantially filled in blanks in previous lo photography so that entire lunar surface, front and back, had now been photographed at resolutions about 10 times better than obtainable from earth-based observations.
Harold Masursky, U.S. Geological Survey, told news conference at jpl that several of the pictures indicated there might be frozen liquid on the floor of perpetually shaded craters near the lunar poles. The nature of the “fluidal materials” was open to speculation, he said, but “meandering rills appeared to have been caused by some form of material flowing from a vdlcanic eruption—similar to terrestrial streams found in desert areas on earth.” (nasa Proj Off; AP, W Post, 8/9/67, A3; upi, C Trib, 8/15/67; NYT, 8/15/67, 1)

•	Congressional cuts in nasa’s FY 1968 authorization bill (S. 1296) indi-
cated that a new era was beginning for NASA and the U.S. space program, Robert Hotz suggested in Aviation Week editorial. “We do not think it was the intent of this Congress to either repudiate or emasculate the
U.S. national space program. We think it was the aim of these legislators to mark the end of the era when NASA got everything it wanted simply because it asked for it in a strident and persistent voice. We think it was also the goal of Congress to put the national space program in a better perspective in relation to such other high-priority problems as the Southeast Asia war and the urban riots. . . .” Hotz predicted that the future of the space program as a valid, continuing national goal “will depend in the long run on the successful development of its new hardware and the successful operation of this equipment on missions of increasing complexity and greater value. The most significant contribution that NASA and its industrial contractor complex can make to the future of the space program now is to bend their every effort to assure that the Apollo hardware will function flawlessly, not only for its missions to the moon but also for long-duration earth-orbital operations. . . .” (Hotz, Av Wk, 8/7/67, 17)

August 8-9: NASA successfully launched five Nike-Apache sounding rockets with chemical cloud experiments and one Areas sounding rocket with a small live animal payload from NASA Wallops Station between 10.43 p.m. and 7:27 a.m. Five Nike-Apaches ejected vapor trails between 50-and 125-mi altitudes to measure wind velocities and directions at various altitudes in the upper atmosphere. Nike-Apache launched at dawn was sodium experiment which created reddish-orange trail; remaining four were trimethylaluminum (tma) experiments which created bluish-green trails. Data were obtained by photographing continuously the motion of the trails from five ground-based camera sites within 100-mi radius of Wallops. Areas sounding rocket carried payload with small live white rat to 25-mi altitude; payload descended by parachute and was recovered from the Atlantic by helicopter. Subsequent examination by Wallops scientists indicated rat was in excellent condition.

•	Military, congressional, and industrial sources agreed that F-111A vari-
able-sweep-wing aircraft had developed new technical difficulties and that old problems had not yet been completely solved, Hanson Baldwin reported in the New York Times. Original plans had called for some F-lllA’s to reach Vietnam for combat tests in fall 1967; “now December or January appear to be the target dates if ‘fixes’ to the present difficulties are successful.” Sources said that excessive vibration— a problem believed to have been completely solved—was recurring in tests. Aircraft was also experiencing difficulty with its speed brakes, and the problem of partial engine stall during flight persisted. Col. Charles W. Reed, project officer for the F—111A at Nellis afb, Nev.,
told Baldwin there were no “real serious problems” with the aircraft and said that accelerated testing and training project which began at Nellis in July was “ahead of schedule.” He conceded, however, that aircraft at Nellis had not yet carried bomb loads. Flight and combat testing of the F-111A was continuing at Edwards AFB and Eglin afb. (Baldwin, NYT, 8/11/67,1,2)

•	OGO “handlers” were hoping that Ogo IV (launched July 28) might be
economical enough with its gas supply to permit it to continue for one year at the peak of its investigative capabilities. Achievement of one-year performance would enable satellite to gather data on earth, its upper atmosphere, and its near-space environment during period of peak solar activity, which occurs every 11 yrs. Ogo IV’s gas system, used to supply thrust to series of small attitude-stabilized jets, had been improved by installation of gas bottle filled with krypton instead of argon. This increased gas pressure from 3,000 psi to 4,000 psi and doubled available impulse from 900 to 1,800 pound-seconds, nasa reported that if present gas expenditure rate were maintained they were assured the minimum 50 days of three-axis stabilized operation that would permit mission success, (nasa Release 67-210)
•	Universities should not rely so heavily on nasa and dod to advance and
support basic science, Cal Tech president Lee A. DuBridge suggested in Science. A moderate fraction of these agencies’ budgets was necessarily used to advance basic research, he said, and in the space program “the resulting technologies are providing a valuable tool for carrying on scientific investigations which would otherwise be impossible.
“However, it must ... be stressed that neither NASA nor any other agency charged with implementing a national-policy goal is intended to be a philanthropic agency authorized to provide benefactions to university science departments. They are agencies seeking to get a job done, and they turn to universities only when the universities can render a service. . . .” DuBridge urged that Federal Government develop a more adequate and balanced program for strengthening basic science by charging “suitable agencies (principally the National Science Foundation) with this particular task” and providing adequate funds for carrying it out.

It had been launched to demonstrate that large inflatable spheres could be used as passive communications reflectors in space. (AP, H Post, 8/13/67; Volker, M News, 8/12/67)
•	AIAA Board of Directors endorsed hobbyists who built model rockets from
paper, plastic, and balsa wood, but warned against the hazards of amateurs mixing their own fuels and experimenting with homemade metal rockets. Action preceded the National Model Rocket Championship contest scheduled to open in Mankato, Minn., Aug. 15. AIAA, which had for many years withheld endorsement of any type of nonprofessional rocket experiments, recommended that model rocketry be conducted only with adult supervision.

On Aug. 11, DOD statement said only that U.S. was “cooperating with the Australian government in a space defense research project.” U.S. officials admitted privately, however, that project was a “ferret” installation to detect radar, electromagnetic radiation, and other electronic impulses emanating from Soviet satellites, (upi, W Star, 8/12/67)
August 14: President Johnson, in a message to Congress on communications policy, announced that he was appointing a 15-man task force headed by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Eugene V. Rostow to formulate “a national communications policy.” Among questions the group would examine were: (1) how soon would a domestic satellite system be economically feasible? (2) should a domestic system be general purpose or specialized? and (3) should there be more than one system? Task force’s report was due in one year. The President also: (1) reaffirmed U.S. commitments made in 1962 and 1964 in support of the development of a global system of comsats “to make modern communications available to all nations”; (2) pledged U.S. support to the continuation of the intelsat consortium, saying, “We seek no domination of satellite communications to the exclusion of any other nation—or group of nations”; (3) stated that U.S. “should take no action in the establishment of a domestic [comsat] system which is incompatible with our support for a global system”; and (4) urged U.S.S.R. and the nations of Eastern Europe to join intelsat. “Here is a rare opportunity to join in an activity to bring benefits to all nations and loss to none.” He suggested there might be an eventual linkage between Soviet Molniya system and intelsat system.
The President concluded: “Historians may write that the human race survived or faltered because of how well it mastered the technology of this age.
“Communications satellites now permit man’s greatest gifts—sight, expression, human thoughts and ideas—to travel unfettered to any portion of our globe. The opportunity is within our grasp. We must be prepared to act.” {PD, 8/21/67, 1146-54; WSJ, 8/15/67)

•	NASA’s Manned Space Flight Network would be tested for the first time
with the unmanned Apollo 4 mission, tentatively scheduled for early October, Barry Kalb reported in the Washington Evening Star. Dr. Friedrich 0. Vonbun, chief of gsfc’s Mission and Trajectory Analysis Div., told Kalb in an interview that the “reliability of the system is 99.5 percent.” Network included a new system, he said, which combined functions of tracking, signaling, and voice communication. Previously a separate system was required for each. Only certain portions of the network would be used for the Apollo 4 mission, Von Bun said. The entire system consisted of 13 earth orbit tracking stations, three deep-space stations (each with a backup unit), five tracking ships, and eight specially fitted jet aircraft. Three deep-space stations, located in Gold-stone, Calif., Madrid, Spain, and Canberra, Australia, were designed specifically for “communicating with vehicles at lunar distance.” (Kalb, W Star, 8/14/67, A6)
•	National Aeronautics and Space Council was accumulating data on various
approaches to earth resources satellites with the goal of forcing competing agencies to agree on a single coordinated program for FY 1969, Aerospace Technology reported. A decision was expected by mid-September. The Depts. of Interior and Agriculture favored an operational program, but NASA believed current technology justified only an R&D approach at this time. (Aero Tech, 8/14/67,3)
•	Electronics Research Center was studying a navigation satellite system
capable of providing location information to ships and aircraft accurate to within 0.1 mi, Aerospace Technology reported. System would be competitive with recently declassified Navy Navigation Satellite System [see July 29], but would be aimed primarily at small users such as private aircraft and pleasure craft. User cost for receiving equipment would range from $1,000 to $5,000. Current phase of program involved three contractors: (1) Philco-Ford Corp., which had completed study on fan beam navigation satellites; (2) RCA, which was studying a hyperbolic L-band ranging system providing continuous radiation of the signal; and (3) trw Systems which was designing a synchronous-orbit satellite system, also operating in the L-band. The next phase, pending NASA Hq. approval, was laboratory testing followed, possibly, by flight experiments in Applications Technology Satellite (ats) or Apollo Applications (aa) program.

•	The time had come to “fix” the responsibility for the total results of U.S.
technology, Michael Getler suggested in Aerospace Technology. There was no single group or agency to “link the broad spectrum of American technological development with social development. There is no single group with the expertise available to probe all forms of technology and its effects, to pump funds into a truly important new applied sci-
ence not able to capture headlines, to speed the transfer of defense and space technology into other areas, and to put the special interest groups on the line for blockage of improvements within the state-of-the-art. There is no group directly responsible to the citizenry to develop and carry through legislation to try and save us from tomorrow’s smog and urban clutter; for we have not, by a long shot, run out of self-inflicted ills. . . .” Getler urged that the overall responsibility be given to Congress. “It is the Legislative branch of Government, properly augmented with a permanent staff of specialists, that is best equipped to serve as a responsive arbiter between the good life of our people, the promise of technology, and the pressure of die marketplace.” (Getler, Aero Tech, 8/14/67,62)
• Soviet mathematician Dr. Alex M. Letov, visiting Huntsville for the Guidance, Control, and Flight Dynamics Conference sponsored by Alabama chapter of the aiaa, said he supported the exchange of technical information between U.S. and U.S.S.R. After delivering an important technical paper, Letov remarked: “I am hopeful that I may have initiated some steps in this area of exchange. I am completely satisfied with my presentation and the response of the American scientist. In my report I will reflect this.” One of the world’s leading authorities on spacecraft guidance and control, Letov outlined a complex theory for stabilizing a large manned spacecraft, which he considered a major problem. “You can’t consider die other problems of engineering if your system is not stable. It must be stable.” (KC Star, 8/15/67)
August 14-18: U.S. scientists “still cannot provide definite protection from the biological hazards” of 1,000-day duration planetary mission, according to experts at Blacksburg, Va., Bioastronautics Conference, sponsored by vpi and NASA. Discussions had indicated: “Extremely long periods of ground simulation and experiments in space with animals will be necessary before man can undertake a 1,000-day journey to a near planet like Mars.” Scientists had discussed several problem areas: ability of man to function in weightlessness for more than 90 days (midcourse goal of Apollo Applications program); weight, volume, and content of food, water and atmosphere requirements; and biological reactions of crew to spacecraft contaminants. Toxicologists considered reaction to be “most insidious potential problem,” respiratory system taking on contaminants in “subtle, long-term reactions.” (Normyle, Av Wh, 8/ 21/67,17; 9/11/67,75-8)
August 15: NASA Administrator James E. Webb, testifying at a closed hearing before House Committee on Appropriations’ Subcommittee on Independent Offices and Department of Housing and Urban Development, said NASA hoped to keep an approximate $5.5-billion annual budget following a manned lunar landing. “. . . we believe it would be wise to keep the budget approximately level, approximately at where it is now or even going up a half billion dollars a year, and use this capability for some further landings on the moon, for ability to move around, for synchronous orbital work with large stations using men for a multiplicity of other purposes related to the earth, and further studies in space. . . .”
“This is very much what the Russians are doing. They are developing a very large number of options and maintaining the ability to select those that are most useful to them at a particular time and move rapidly with it and creating the image that they are out in front with respect
to all these modem technologies.” Webb said he believed four recent launchings of large unmanned spacecraft by U.S.S.R. were “preparations for manned flights shortly to come. I believe they are flights to work out the difficulties that resulted in the death of their cosmonaut.” (Transcript, pp. 8, 34)
•	Selection of NASA’s sixth astronaut class [see Aug. 4] indicated that astro-
naut “glamour” grew with each new peril, Neal Stanford reported in Christian Science Monitor. “Scientists . . . compete more intensively for the few scientist-astronaut jobs open than do jet pilots in the military services for the pilot j obs available.
“The glamour has not entirely gone out of space flying. What has happened is that its perils have become more apparent, its scientific opportunities more exciting, and its financial rewards less considerable.
“There have been 6 selections of astronauts, 4 of flier astronauts, and 2 of science astronauts. In this sixth and latest selection 939 [sic] scientists applied for the 11 positions open. In the previous selection of pilot astronauts only 403 applied for 19 positions open. . . .” (Stanford, CSM, 8/15/67)

Developed jointly by New York Airways, McDonnell Douglas Corp., and Cutler-Hammer, Inc., proposal called for four-engine turboprop that could cruise at speeds ranging from 50-250 mp'h and land on strips 1,200-1,400 ft long. Financing the estimated $12-$15-million demonstration project would probably require “some sort of contract operation, presumably with a Government agency,” Cummings said. (NYT, 8/16/67, 66)
August 15-17: Divers Arthur Pachette and Glen Taylor set records for longest and deepest underwater excursions outside a protective capsule in series of three saturation dives in Gulf of Mexico. Sponsored by Ocean Systems Inc., and Esso Production Research, tests studied new deep-diving system designed to enable men eventually to walk and work on the ocean floor at depths of 1,000 ft or more. During tests divers descended 636 ft in a steel hull sphere, donned rubberized “wetsuits” and, breathing a helium-oxygen gas mixture, worked on a dummy oil well outside the capsule for nearly seven hours. Ocean Systems spokesman said they experienced no decompression problems and were able to manipulate nuts and bolts and replace valves. In Westinghouse Electric Corp. tests in June, divers descended to 600 ft in similar operation, but did not remain at the depth long enough to achieve saturation—condition in which the body tissues become completely saturated with gases contained in breathing mixture. ■ (Wilford, NYT, 8/25/67,19; Aero Tech, 8/28/67,22)

•	Astronauts Walter M. Schirra, Donn F. Eisele, and Walter Cunningham
toured McDonnell Douglas Test Facility near Sacramento to inspect 3rd stage of the Saturn V booster which would be used to launch them on first manned Apollo mission in 1968. Schirra told newsmen that NASA would not be “pressed by the press” into flying the mission on a specific date. Asked if he believed pressure from the press was in any way responsible for the Jan. 27 fire, Schirra replied: “. . . I found that whenever we . . . get together with the members of the press that you’re
right away asking us, ‘Well, now when are yon going to fly?’ That’s almost the first question, and it’s not a very unique question. ... It seems you want that answer that may be hard news, but when we give you that answer then if we don’t make that date, for some reason or another it appears that we’re failing our goal. While the goal is to have a successful flight at a reasonable time rather than an early failure. . . .” (Transcript)

•	The Federal Government had involved itself in the SST program because
failure to do so would have resulted in a loss of jobs and progress in U.S. aviation industry, m/g J. C. Maxwell (usaf), Director of faa sst Development, told the National Space Club. “The aircraft industry had been challenged by a powerful consortium [Concorde] of two large aircraft companies fully subsidized by two major governments. Our aircraft companies did not have the resources to meet this challenge. The government acted.” Federal participation had resulted in some major side effects, Maxwell said. “We were able to make available to all . potential sst contractors a vast amount of technological information that the government had acquired in its own huge aircraft endeavors. The flight test experiences of the B—70, the SR—71, and the F—111 were and are being provided to our sst contractors. . . . We were able . . . to contribute some 49,000 hours of sst wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA. The military . . . has logged some 300,000 hours of supersonic experience. . . . The sst program is founded on the experience and know-how from other programs sponsored and paid for by the government—and that includes the space effort.
“Another benefit . . . [was] the fact that the resources of the whole aviation industry were brought into the project. Our search for the best design was, in every sense of the word, a competition. The best talent and genius of American aeronautical engineering was put to work.” (Text)
August 17: Photo of the earth in the near full phase transmitted by Lunar Orbiter V [see Aug. 5-27] was a “fraud, a fake, a piece of trickery or deceit,” Samuel Shenton, Secretary of the International Flat Earth Research Society, told newsmen in London. “Look at the photograph the satellite supposedly took. Notice those lines across the bottom of the picture. They show it’s a composite, a mock-up.” Asked why U.S. should seek to perpetrate such a deception, Shenton replied: “It’s all part of the great global earth conspiracy, and it’s a shame.” Members of the International Flat Earth Research Society believed that the earth is not only flat, but static in space. They also maintained that the theory of gravity was advanced only to support the belief that the earth spins. (AP, B Sun, 8/18/67)

August 18: House Committee on Appropriations reported $4.6-billion NASA FY 1968 appropriation bill—$516.6 million less than NASA had requested and $282 million less than NASA FY 1968 authorization bill (S. 1296). Committee said the bill was “less than would be recommended under less stringent fiscal circumstances,” but it would support “a viable space program, and one that is consistent with available resources.
“The reductions . . . should in no respect be interpreted as an expression of a lack of confidence in our space endeavors. . . .” Cuts included: (1) $50.5 million from Apollo program; (2) $154.7 million from aa program; (3) $27.5 million from Nuclear Rocket Program;

•	First two Apollo spacesuits incorporating changes recommended by NASA’s
Apollo 204 Review Board were scheduled to arrive at msc in early September for thermo-vacuum and compatibility testing. New suit, designated A-7L, was an improved version of the original A-6L suit. Changes, primarily replacing flammable materials with nonflammable or low-flammability materials, included substitution of: (1) Beta fabric, a nonflammable fiberglass cloth, for Nomex, a high-temperature nylon, in outside layer; (2) Nomex for a more flammable nylon inner layer; and (3) fire-resistant Kapton/Beta fiberglass insulation for aluminized Mylar-Dacron insulation. In addition to its greater fire-resistant properties, spacesuit, which was white rather than blue, was more comfortable and mobile than A-6L. It would be used in all manned Apollo missions during prelaunch and launch phases, and reentry. First production model of spacesuit, manufactured by International Latex Corp.’s Government and Industrial Div. under msc contract, was scheduled for mid-October delivery, (nasa Release 67—222)
•	Rocket engine for Apollo service module’s propulsion system had been
undergoing tests at Arnold Engineering Development Center during past 3Y2 years. Initially, engine performance was unknown; it would use an ablatively cooled thrust chamber and a high expansion ratio nozzle of thin metal and would operate at relatively low combustion chamber pressures. Initial tests were on configuration of engine’s fragile nozzles. Follow-on tests, for prequalification of engine combined with heavy duty replica of propellant tankage, had checked ballistic performance. Simulated high-altitude testing would lead to eventual man-rating of propulsion system, (aedc Release 67-212)
•	nasa had awarded naa’s Rocketdyne Div. a $1.4-million contract for con-
tinued technological investigation of the advanced aerospike rocket engine. Studied by oart for 1% yrs, the engine utilizes a doughnutshaped combustion chamber which discharges exhaust gases against the surface of a short center cone. In conventional rocket engines, gases are expanded inside long bell-shaped nozzles. Current concept specified an engine 8 ft in diameter and 4% ft high—about 50% shorter than con-
ventional bell nozzle engines. A new “aerodynamically compensating nozzle” would permit use of the engine at sea level or high altitude, making it potentially suitable for both lower and upper stages of launch vehicles. Contract completion date was May 31, '1968. (nasa Release 67-221)
•	A completely fireproof version of the spacecraft fabric Velcro had been

In tests conducted at msc early in August, the all-metallic fabric did not ignite, even in pure oxygen atmosphere at 16.5 psia. Velcro Corp. vice president Jack Mates told Hines in an interview that NASA had not yet placed an order for the improved Velcro, but that his company was beginning production of a substantial quantity. In the Jan. 27 Apollo fire, flames in the spacecraft had quickly spread along the surface of ordinary nylon Velcro adhesive pads which were used to hold frequently used equipment.

Other factors such as accessibility to users, construction costs, future expansion possibilities, obstructions, anticipated community response to aircraft noise, and proximity to other airports could be even more important factors. Airport site selection was a local responsibility, guide noted, but all sponsors of civil airport projects were required to notify faa of proposed construction so agency could review project’s effect on surrounding airspace, (faa Release 67-62)
August 19: Negotiations were being conducted in Washington, D.C., to move Canada’s High Altitude Research Project (harp) from McGill Univ. to Univ. of Vermont, Jay Walz reported in the New York Times. Move was a result of Canada’s decision to cut off funding because it believed program should be self-supporting, harp, which maintained a launch site in Highwater, Quebec, near the Vermont border, used 16-in naval guns to launch payloads inexpensively into the ionosphere for scientific and meteorological experiments. Project, which received about $1.2 million annually from U.S. Army, employed 50 persons at McGill Univ., 70 at Highwater, and 60 at a launch site in Barbados, West Indies. (Walz, NYT, 8/20/67,20)
•	An unusual sequence of Soviet launches had led some U.S. officials to
conclude that U.S.S.R. was testing techniques for reentering warheads from space, Evert Clark reported in the New York Times. “This could mean that the Russians are developing weapons to be stationed in orbit. Weapon re-entry techniques can be tested with or without the use of weapons, and the same re-entry techniques can be used for either nuclear or conventional weapons.” Clark said all of the flights (1) were very short, (2) had been launched from Tyuratam range, (3) had entered orbits with 49° inclination, and (4) had been given a Cosmos number. A resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1963 asked all nations to refrain from orbiting weapons of mass destruction. The question of whether resolution prohibited the development of such weapons had never been clarified, Clark said. (Clark, NYT, 8/20/67, 17)

August 22—31: International Astronomical Union (iau) met in Prague.
Dr. Robert B. Leighton of Cal Tech reported that there were about
three times as many craters on Mars as preliminary photos transmitted in 1965 by Mariner IV spacecraft indicated. Citing data from two-year study of photos using new computer-enhancement technique, Dr. Leighton said pictures showed 300 clearly defined craters and more than 300 additional possible craters. Original estimate from unprocessed pictures was less than 100. Mars appeared to be about as densely pitted as the moon but its craters were smoother because of more effective erosion processes. Several photos showed a number of linear features similar to lines formed by rifts and faults on the moon. These features were not the “much-discussed” canals of Mars because they were too narrow to be visible from earth. Dr. Leighton said, but they might be related to some of the markings identified earlier as canals, (nasa Release 67—225)
Dr. and Mrs. Pierre Connes of Haute Provence Observatory and Meudon Observatory, France, respectively, reported evidence that might indicate Venusian clouds are not formed by water. Observation technique which greatly increased precision with which planets’ spectra could be analyzed showed spectral lines of hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride in the light reflected from Venus. When hydrogen fluoride combines with water it creates hydrochloric acid which absorbs radar waves; yet radar waves are known to penetrate Venutian clouds, returning echoes to the surface of the earth. (Sullivan, NYT, 8/24/67)
The “mysterium phenomenon”—peculiar radio emissions from the Milky Way which display almost all the characteristics of artificial interstellar communication—was the subject of a report by Dr. T. K. Menon, National Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank, W. Va., and a later panel discussion. Dr. Menon said most recent observations of the emissions in the nearby part of the galaxy had been made simultaneously from California, Massachusetts, and U.K., using almost the entire width of earth as a baseline for measurement. They had identified sources of emissions which were smaller than the smallest star as seen by the human eye and discovered some of these emissions were fluctuating on time scales measured in hours or even less. Panel raised the possibility that emissions might be from stars in the process of formation. They were being transmitted at four closely spaced wavelengths associated with hydroxyl, a molecule formed of a single oxygen and hydrogen atom, and were being given off when such molecules shed energy. Emissions also appeared to have various properties associated with a maser—man-made device in which a radio or light wave is beamed through certain atoms whose energy has been raised, enormously amplifying original wave and, if wave is confined to a single axis, producing a beam of extreme intensity.

Lunar Committee postponed naming of surface features on moon’s far side pending the results of Lunar Orbiter V mission. A list of 228 names for approximately 500 major features had been submitted by Soviet scientists, but U.S. delegates cited errors in their designations and asked that features be assigned numbers until a more definitive map could be prepared using Lunar Orbiter V photos.

IAU president Dr. Pol Swings of Belgium confirmed an observation made by two obscure Irish astronomers in 1882. Astronomers Lohse and
Copeland had observed a comet during the day, apparently with a handheld spectroscope, and reported that it glowed strongly with spectral lines of iron as it passed the sun. All earlier observations of light emitted from comets as they neared the sun indicated they were composed of very light materials, and the idea that they were rich in iron was viewed skeptically. However, photos and electric recordings taken of the comet Ikeya-Seki as it passed the sun in 1966 showed unmistakable spectral lines of iron, Dr. Swings said. (Sullivan, NYT, 8/27/67, 51)
Dr. Gordon H. Pettengill, mit’s Lincoln Laboratory, said that results from an experiment which studied Martian terrain by bouncing radar signals off the planet indicated: (1) Mars was roughly as mountainous as earth; (2) there were no large bodies of water on Mars; and (3) there was no clear correlation between height of land and presence of dark areas on Mars. (Sullivan, NYT, 8/30/67, 15)
Dr. Bradford A. Smith, New Mexico State Univ., confirmed report by French astronomer Pierre Guerin that atmosphere of Venus was moving around the planet in a clockwise direction at a remarkable rate of speed.

Johnson to formulate a national communications policy [see Aug. 19]: “The . . . task force . . . has an unprecedented opportunity to break internal governmental deadlocks that stand in the way of a domestic satellite system and other needed forward steps in communications. It can do much to advance public television and to give all TV, both commercial and noncommercial, a firmer root in public service. Perhaps most important of all, it can point a path for the interconnection of international satellites so that all countries can be encouraged to see and speak to one another across the heavens. ...

August 28-30: aiaa meeting on “Space Program Issues of the ’70’s” was held in Seattle.
Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.), Chairman of House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Space Science and Applications Subcommittee, said in panel discussion that the civilian part of the Nation’s space program “no longer has a very high priority,” partly because of the Vietnam war and partly because NASA had not convinced the public and Congress of the economic and technological benefits of space research. Spending on space exploration was not likely to be increased significantly for several years and accomplishments in the 1970s could be
“severely limited.” He said: “Recent Congressional action on the 1968 NASA budget was a direct reflection of these changing [economic, political, and social] values; it was also a reflection of how the mood of a majority of those in the Congress has changed [and] there is little doubt that the worth of the space program, in terms of economic, political and social values, has been judged and found wanting by large numbers of the public and their representatives in government.” He added that, “in spite of great advances, scientific and technological programs are among the least understood of our national efforts [but, on the other hand] every nation in the world that is unable or fails to carry out an aggressive r&d program also fails to develop an economy that educates, feeds, houses and clothes its people.” Karth urged that NASA consider “an evolution to a functional organizational arrangement ... on such a breakdown as: earth orhital, lunar, solar, planetary and deep space.” He hoped to see “the emergence of a better system” for long-range planning which was not simply a “pasting together of manned and unmanned plans,” but said that “long-range prospects for progress are enormous [and] these prospects must be sold to the public and top policy-makers in terms of what makes sense for the overall benefit of society.” (Text; Wilford, NYT, 8/30/67, 17)
nasc Executive Secretary Dr. Edward C. Welsh described national space program planning as having “characteristics of complexity, flexibility, and continuity.” He recalled that nasc had recommended to the President that the Nation undertake the Apollo program, with its “within this decade schedule” and added: “Apollo project was planned at a time when we were in a secondary position to the Soviets in space competence [and] when we needed a policy decision and specific plans to accomplish that decision in order to energize our entire space effort. Along with a number of other space projects, this major project has given substantial spirit and substance to our program and we are no longer behind any country in over-all space performance.” Welsh concluded: ‘“this country does not now need such a special source of impetus [like Apollo] to keep it going in the right direction in space [and] to maintain our competence or sense of purpose.” (Text)
Dr. Albert J. Kelley, formerly Deputy Director of erc and currently Dean of Boston College’s Graduate School and School of Business Administration, argued that clearly defined post-Apollo goals had to be formulated if full potential of the Nation’s space program were to be realized. “If we set forward well-defined goals and plans we have a good possibility of continuing to maintain a strong national space program; if not, then we stand a chance of losing by default much of our gains to date, but even more important of not realizing our potential payoffs in the 70’s.” (SBD, 8/30/67,312)
August 28—31: Aviation Subcommittee of Senate Committee on Commerce held hearings to explore needs, problems, and means of maintaining an adequate airport system for a forecast 400% air passenger growth by 1980.

Among other proposals were noise standards, engine and airframe redesign, cab diversion of traffic, reliever airports, air taxis, helicopter service, and high-speed ground transportation. Also recommended to the committee were increased state participation, tightened congressional control, and a national air transport system. (Text)
August 29: Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R-Me.) expressed concern on Senate floor that the Nation’s space program suffered from a “serious lack of centralized leadership within the administration. Leadership is needed to weigh and decide on the merits of proposed space projects; to coordinate program requirements and development efforts of civil and defense agencies; and to establish long-range national space goals and to seek the resources necessary to achieve them.
“I believe that this failure to assert administrative responsibility has resulted in the costly and needless development of two families of launch vehicles—one for NASA and one for the Department of Defense. Currently, NASA and the Department of Defense are each separately undertaking manned space programs having similar, if not identical, basic objectives—to determine whether man can effectively operate in space. . . .”	.
Criticizing President Johnson’s support of NASA FY 1968 budget cuts recommended by House Appropriations Committee [see Aug. 21], Sen. Smith said: “I am mindful that some significant budgetary decisions must be made because of our commitments in Vietnam and social strife at home. But is the Congress to supply the initial decisionmaking power for the executive branch? Is so little consideration and concern given to determining the required resource level for space technology programs that across-the-board reduction recommended by a legislative committee can be accepted so lightly ?
“There are many of us who feel that science and technology may well be the key to our future existence—to the very survival of freedom in the world of tomorrow. In the past, I believe that the administration also held this to be true. However, the present lack of responsible action in regard to our space program leads me to wonder whether the administration plans and manages the future course for our country with any foresight or merely reacts to events with fear and trepidation.” (CR,

During August: “Despite the rancor and doubt of the moment [about U.S. space program], the evidence is persuasive that the nation has been well served indeed,” Fortune magazine said in an article reviewing NASA problems, shortcomings, and accomplishments. The article, “Jim Webb’s Earthy Management of Space,” said: “Webb . . . has developed a managerial doctrine as extraordinary as the space mission itself. Essentially it is a bold extension of the systems-management principle first applied in the Pentagon for weapon development. This approach means that the Pentagon tries to relate design and procurement plans to the weapon system’s maximum potential, to other weapon systems, to cost effectiveness, to foreseeable strategic situations, and to other special considerations. In NASA’s case, the ‘system’ is usually an exotic research objective, like landing a package of instruments on Mars. Such an undertaking, of course, requires management consideration of costs and engineering feasibility, but NASA also tries to relate it to the social, economic, and even political impact the new knowledge may have on some of the most basic mysteries of human life. In one sense, the system becomes an exercise in applied philosophy. To master such massively complex and extensive problems, the agency has mobilized some 20,000 individual firms, more than 400,000 workers, and 200 colleges and universities in a combine of the most advanced resources of American civilization.” (Mecklin, Fortune, 8/67)

Some scientists believed much of the fluid material ejected when the three-mile-deep crater was formed might have resulted from the intense heat generated by the meteoroid’s impact. They also suggested that the appearance of the dark halo resulted from the manner in which pulverized ejected material had been deposited. Material might have traveled outward from the impact point in a “base surge” close to the moon’s surface, giving a windswept appearance to the terrain. NASA photo afforded scientists first close-up view of the crater floor, providing new clues to its origin. Orbiter Vs high resolution telephoto picture showed fractures, flow markings, and protruding domelike hills with exposed layers. The Tycho region was one of the 36 areas of high scientific interest on the moon photographed by Lunar Orbiter V. (nasa Release 67-231)

September 4: NASA-sponsored research on equipment used for surviving hard landing on the moon and planets had been conducted by Cal Tech-JPL engineers in simulated operations. Split-second jpl impact tests, which used powerful compressed air guns and a giant slingshot, hurtled equipment against solid backstops at speeds up to 500 feet per second (340 mph). JPl’s engineer, Stan Taylor, explained: “During the brief instant that the test specimen is experiencing the 10,000 g shock, every part of it behaves as though it weighed 10,000 times its normal weight. The bolts supporting a one pound test item have to be good for about five tons.” The experiments had proved that intricate, delicate components required in sophisticated unmanned spacecraft of today and tomorrow could be protected to withstand shocks of 10,000 g.

September 7—9: NASA’s Biosatellite II (Biosatellite-B) was successfully launched from etr by a two-stage Thrust-Augmented Improved Delta launch vehicle into orbit with 202-mi (326-km) apogee, 187-mi (302km) perigee, 90.8-min period, and 33.5° inclination. The 940-lb research spacecraft consisted of three main sections: an adapter section which would remain in orbit; the reentry vehicle carrying the retrorocket and heat shield for reentry into the earth’s atmosphere; and, within the reentry vehicle, the experiment capsule containing the scientific experiments, life support equipment, parachutes, and radio beacon to aid in recovery. Biosatellite II carried 13 experiments to determine effects of the space environment on various life processes.
Performance of the spacecraft was satisfactory except for some difficulty with completely reliable response to command transmission from the ground stations and out-of-spec accelerations during the first few orbits. The spacecraft’s temperature, attitude control, and atmospheric pressure readings were normal, and few additional anomalies were experienced. Mid-air recovery of NASA’s Biosatellite II experiment capsule, by aircraft at 3:15 pm edt Sept. 9, within 15 mi of predicted impact location of 7°15'N and 162°1'W, marked a new first. Biosatellite /, which had remained in orbit for two months after the retrorocket failed, landed in the ocean near Australia following reentry Feb. 15, but was not recovered.
The most important single question for Biosatellite II was whether the changes produced in organisms by radiation are slowed or hastened under weightless conditions. Biosatellite scientists had noted that early recovery had resulted in less risk to the experiments than if recovery had been delayed beyond the planned three days. Despite the delayed launch and early recovery, scientists reported only a small decrease in the expected data return from the experiments. Indications were that all programmed events in orbit, such as fixation of frog eggs, fixation and

feeding of amoeba, fixation of wheat seeds, and pepper plant camera shutter opening, had worked as planned. Successful recovery of plant and animal life carried on a 45-hr journey through space by Biosatellite II was expected to provide important clues to how life forms would develop in a weightless environment or how radiation might affect future generations.

commands to turn its transmitter to low power. Spacecraft telemetry indicated that all systems were operational. The Surveyor V midcourse correction was accomplished at 21:45 Edt Sept, 8, Immediately after the correction, the pressure in the helium supply tank was determined to be decreasing, indicating that the regulating valve did not make a positive closure. Correction of leak was not possible; a descent strategy was developed to overcome the resultant degradation of the vernier engine retrograde capability.
Surveyor V softlanded on the moon at 20:46:38 edt on Sept. 10. The landing site was in the Sea of Tranquility at approximate coordinates 23.19°E, 1.52°N, some 18 mi from the target point. The spacecraft took 200- and 600-line pictures of the lunar surface and conducted an alpha backscattering experiment. At lunar sunset, 6:40 am edt, Sept. 24, 18,006 high-quality lunar photographs had been obtained (more than the combined totals from Surveyors / and III). The alpha-backscat-tering instrument had operated for 83 hours on the lunar surface, providing excellent data on the relative abundance of chemical elements in lunar material. To optimize the conditions for lunar-night survival, the spacecraft was operated for short periods at 2%-hr intervals, using compartment heaters, until the battery charge was down to 30 ampere hours, about 4-6 days after lunar sunset. The spacecraft then would be placed in hibernation for the remainder of the lunar night.
The vernier engine erosion experiment was conducted at 01.38 edt on Sept, 13, to obtain information on effects of impingement of a high velocity jet-gas stream on the lunar surface. TV pictures were taken of the area under study before and after vernier engine firing. Initially no sig-
nificant erosion was noted, but follow-on operations with low sun angle photographs and shadow progression studies revealed a crater-like depression under vernier engine number 3 which had not been visible at the higher sun elevations. Surveyor V accomplished all mission objectives. Before touchdown, radar reflectivity data were obtained; touchdown dynamics data were determined at landing time (bearing strength of lunar surface as the ultimate objective). Thermal data were obtained (accumulation of - data throughout the mission was the ultimate objective).

according to the magazine Technica Molodezhi. The astronomer added that he did not believe they were full of little men from far out in space either. Previously, ufos had been written off by Soviet commentators as inventions of the foreign press or the hallucinations of disturbed persons. Mr. Makarov wrote that “the files of some private persons and organizations dealing with these phenomena either as their official job or out of curiosity are filled with considerable information. Whatever they may be, we cannot say that some phenomena which are still hard to explain exist in reality.” Mr. Makarov said data had come from radar stations, pilots, and scientists “about whose common sense and honesty we have no right to be doubtful.” (NYT, 9/14/67)
September 16: The likelihood of aircraft collisions and ship collisions would be reduced considerably by an advanced navigation satellite, NASA’s Eugene Ehrlich, chief of NASA’s Navigation and Traffic Control program,
explained. By providing accurate position fixes, a system of such satellites also could reduce the separation distances between aircraft; automatically steer ships across oceans; warn high-flying supersonic jets of radiation dangers; guide craft around bad weather; monitor airplane systems for possible trouble; and pinpoint ditched planes or ships in distress. “The navigation satellite of 1970-1980 will be an entirely different spacecraft from the presently operational navigation satellites of the United States Navy.” The Navy orbited its first Transit navigation satellite in 1960. Attention had focused on the Navy system recently when the U.S. announced that the previously classified network would be made available to America’s civilian ships. The Navy satellites orbit at 700 miles. NASA envisioned a network of evenly spaced synchronous satellites 22,300 miles above the earth. A ground craft could he in touch with as many as six of them simultaneously for extremely accurate positioning. Mr. Ehrlich said advanced satellites “will contain a position determination capability, communications service, weather relay service and scientific sensors.” He said the Maritime Administration and advanced thinkers in the shipping field had been looking to the day of the automated ship. “The satellite-derived position information would be fed directly into the ship’s computer to keep the ship on a preset path.” Mr. Ehrlich also had said that the reduction of the present widely spaced separation standards for aircraft was estimated to be capable of saving some $46.5 million annually for the North Atlantic region alone.

•	Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara announced his approval for
production and deployment of a “thin” Nike-X antiballistic missile (abm ) system at a meeting of upi editors and publishers in San Francisco. He explained: “Were we to deploy a heavy abm system throughout the United States, the Soviets would clearly be strongly motivated to so increase their offensive capability as to cancel out our defensive advantage.” He opposed a more advanced, heavy, anti-Soviet system and approved the “thin” abm system because “the system would be relatively inexpensive—preliminary estimates place the cost at about $5 billion—and we would have a much higher degree of reliability against a Chinese attack than the much more massive and complicated system that some have recommended against a possible Soviet attack.” McNamara stated: “An abm deployment designed against a possible Chinese attack . . . would provide an additional indication to Asians that we intend to deter China from nuclear blackmail, and thus would contribute toward our goal of discouraging nuclear weapon proliferation among the present nonnuclear countries.”
The Secretary of Defense said the defensive move was being made with China in mind, not the Soviet Union. He warned the Soviet Union, however, that if it decided to expand its limited antimissile system, the U.S. would respond by increasing its offensive forces to maintain its overwhelming retaliatory capacity.
The decision was generally applauded by congressional leaders but also unleashed an offensive—expected to be focused in the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy—for building a “heavy” defense system against Soviet missiles, reported John W. Finney in New York Times.
The proposed “thin” abm system would provide each region of the U.S. with at least one battery of warhead interceptors, reported AP.

•	Britain’s leading radio astronomer, Sir Bernard Lovell, was convinced
the Soviet Union would attempt one or more space spectaculars during 1967, possibly during October, reported Richard Lewis of Chicago Sun-Times. October would mark the 10th anniversary of the launching of the first satellite, Sputnik I, and the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. The possibilities included a flight around the moon or a lunar landing with animals as passengers, a manned space station in earth orbit, and the first photographs of the planet Venus, the astronomer said. Sir Bernard Lovell said: “I have always believed that 1967 was the year they would try the circumlunar (around the moon) flight, but
I should think they would do it unmanned because of the difficulties of the return at lunar flight velocity.” (Lewis, C S/T, 9/18/67, 16)

The Interrogation, Recording and Location System (irls) , developed by Goddard Space Flight Center, would demonstrate the use of a satellite to locate and determine the position of sensors, receive data from the sensor, record that data on the spacecraft, and later relay the data to ground stations. Possible terrestrial sensors are meteorological stations or buoys, oceanographic buoys, gauges for measuring the strains in the earth’s crust, drifting balloons, ice islands, or any of a wide variety of data platforms located on the surface of the earth or in its atmosphere. Seamans said, “It is quite easy to conceive how such a system could begin to solve many of the problems hindering world-wide fixed or free buoy systems for the study of currents and ocean-depth profile data.” He also noted that “photographs and images returned by such satellites as Nimbus, Tiros, and Gemini are being analyzed to assess their oceanographic value.” (Text)

September 20: In informal remarks at Kennedy Space Center, NASA Administrator James E. Webb predicted that congressional cuts in the space budget would slow up the launch rate and lead to the phasing out of Apollo equipment after man landed on the moon. Webb said that only nine of the 15 Saturn V launch vehicles could be launched before 1970, instead of 13 planned launchings. “I don’t think there’s any doubt that to absorb this cut for $500 million, after already having absorbed a $600 million cut back in 1964, means that we will have to slow up the launch rate,” he stated. The cut had also knocked out any new planetary missions before 1975. Space budget cuts would likely mean die elimination of the Saturn IB from the middle-term space program, Webb explained in a brief press conference. NASA was committed to the purchase of 16 Saturn IB launch vehicles. Three had been flown; the next one would propel the first manned Apollo into earth orbit in mid-1968. NASA planned to switch manned flights to the three-stage Saturn V as soon as possible. The first Saturn V flight, an unmanned test, was scheduled for Oct. 19. The Saturn IB had been planned for continued use on flights not requiring the huge power of the Saturn V, but Webb said that emphasis instead would switch to the Air Force’s Titan HIM launch vehicle, being developed for the military Manned Orbiting Laboratory. Webb listed several future checkpoints: (1) fewer orders for new Apollo spacecraft equipment after the moon landing, in such programs as Apollo Applications; (2) definition of the next system after Apollo, which could be a 100,000-lb space station, or something bigger, launched
with Saturn V, or a new launch vehicle; (3) development of new and better concepts since planetary missions have been knocked out until 1975; and (4) massive reorganizational changes a possibility for NASA.
Webb and West Germany Minister for Scientific Research Dr. Gerhard Stoltenberg, at the press conference, stated jointly: five West German scientists would participate in studying Apollo program results, and two research satellites and a solar probe would be launched in West German-U.S. cooperative program. Stoltenberg also said that West German industry would be main contractor for an ESRO satellite for 1969 launching, the “first German satellite.” Webb said Associate Administrator Dr. Homer E.

September 21—22: Rep. Emilio Q. Daddario (D-Conn.), Chairman, House
Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Science, Research, and Development Subcommittee, addressed House Seminar on Technology Assessment: “The past few years have brought a change in attitude toward science and technology, both in the public which is more technically literate, and in the Congress with its enhanced understanding. Faith in science, and awe of technology, have been supplanted by a recognition of a grave responsibility for decision—that is, what should we do with what we know? Technology assessment is a major key to discharging that responsibility. We are now turning to the natural sciences and asking them to move further in achieving a collective wisdom with politics, law, economics, and social interests for the management of technology. . . . The technical community must introduce a concern for public policy impacts and methods of operation—at an early point and in considerable detail. We believe that technology assessment will involve the scientific method and will be largely accomplished by scientists and engineers. But the purpose of assessment is to enable decisions for the public good.” (Text)

He quoted from a speech which he had presented on Sept. 12 to a luncheon meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, held in Washington, D.C.: “It is possible to have noise control and industrial development without penalty to each other. . . . The idea that noise is a necessary price of industrial and economic progress is as antiquated as is the belief that contaminated waters and a polluted atmosphere must also accompany civilization’s material advances. . . . Noise pollution, however, unlike water and air pollution, is only now beginning to receive a proper share of public attention.” (CR, 9/27/67, H12606-13)

September 27-October 2: nasa launched for ComSatCorp the fourth of Intelsat ii series of commercial communications satellites (Intelsat II—D)-— designated Pacific II—and second of them in the Pacific. Launch was from etr by Thrust-Augmented Delta (DSV-3E) launch vehicle. Satellite went into transfer orbit over Pacific at approximately 176° east with 29,056-mi (37,105-km) apogee, 186-mi (299-km) perigee, 658.8-min period, and 26.4° inclination. Satellite would supplement services of and replace current Pacific satellite, Intelsat II-B (174°E), in event of its failure, nasa support nominally would terminate after about three days, subsequent to providing backup transfer orbit data and calculations. Final orbit and spin axis orientation would be made by ComSatCorp with onboard hydrogen peroxide system. Approximately 15 days after launch, satellite would be available for commercial use. Satellites could handle TV data transmissions, or up to 240 voice channels (480 circuits) between “first class” ground stations such as Andover. Part of satellite capacity would support ncs/nascom for Apollo program. It would serve as backup against interruption of satellite communications service and would add communications capability across the Pacific.
On Sept. 30, apogee motor was ignited at 7:45 pm edt, on command from ComSatCorp-operated earth station at Paumalu, Hawaii, and kicked new satellite from its elliptical transfer orbit into a planned, near-synchronous orbit over Pacific. Reorientation and velocity correction maneuvers were carried out Oct. 1 and 2 to place spin axis in orbit plane and to improve circularity with predicted orbit (resulting from these maneuvers) of apogee, 22,531 mi (36,260 km), perigee, 21,805 mi (35,091 km), period, 1,430.5 min. drift rate, 1° east per day. As Intelsat II—D approached Intelsat II—B, launched Jan. 11, now located between 174° and 175°, drift rate would be reduced and intersatellite interference tests would be conducted to determine minimum angular separation which could be employed without mutual interference (nasa cooperating with ComSatCorp in planning tests). The Intelsat satellite system, in addition to this new Pacific II satellite, included the Pacific I satellite and two satellites serving the Atlantic area, Early Bird I, launched Apr. 6, 1965, and Atlantic II, launched Mar. 22, 1967.

September 28: NASA Administrator James E. Webb testified before the Subcommittee on Independent Offices, Senate Committee on Appropriations. His prepared statement made these principal points: NASA would not be able to achieve for this Nation “a position of leadership in space” for less money than an annual budget of between $5.5-$6.0 billion a year.
At the proposed level of funding, after launch vehicle #216, production of the Saturn IB and the earth-orbital portion of the Apollo Applications Program would be terminated. Rather than continue to use the Apollo system for work in orbit at conclusion of Apollo flights, NASA would accept a hiatus in the continuous development of manned space flight, deciding on a fresh start for the years ahead. A new study would be begun in FY 1968 and FY 1969 on purposes and form of future development of spacecraft and “the national family of large launch vehicles that should be available in the 1970’s.” This “basic change in the United States space outlook” would make it “clearly prudent to preserve the physical facilities which have been built and paid for and which would be required if a decision is made to construct a large solid rocket vehicle.” Because the budget level approved by the House would prevent beginning work on NERVA II, development of a flight weight engine of the nerva i class, “with probably from 60,000 to
75,000	lbs of thrust” would be initiated in FY 1968. Because we would have “no choice” but to accept the fact that Voyager cannot be initiated in FY 1968, and, in order to preserve “a capability for future planetary programs,” NASA would propose about $10 million for the “lunar and planetary program for studies and supporting research in the technology of planetary exploration.” NASA would propose no changes in the budget for the Apollo program but would “accept the legislative history as a clear signal that we should proceed with a hard-hitting carefully managed effort to achieve the objectives of the Apollo program.” nasa would be able to launch “a total of nine Saturn V unmanned and manned missions before the end of Calendar Year 1969.” A further reduction in funding in FY	1968 could only cause	“complete havoc” and	would
be a blow to the	national aeronautical	and space effort	from	which
it would be extremely difficult to recover.
Webb told the subcommittee: “In this situation, we cannot ask, as we otherwise would have done, that the Senate restore in full the amount reduced by the House. . . . We are here to ask the committee that the Senate approve the amounts passed by the House and accepted by the President, and to make a clear record in the legislative history that will give us	the flexibility we will	need to permit	us to	carry
out the strongest	possible program within the amounts	made	avail-
able to us. . . . Long leadtimes requiring timely initiation of new programs and implying commitment to proceed over a period of years would . . . make it perfectly clear to all that we cannot somehow find a way to carry forward the same program and give the Nation the same assurance of a strong position in aeronautics and space with a $517 million cut in our budget.”
He said he had been in touch with the President in the last 24 hours and “he still believes the recommendations he made in January represent” the best budget for the country. But the President also believed his proposed 10 percent income tax surcharge “is more important to press for than extra money for the space bill.” Webb said he had drastically reshaped the space program to comply with the $4.5 billion fund for this year voted by the House and approved by the President. But Subcommittee Chairman Warren G. Magnuson (D-Wash.) and several senators, with major space installations in their states, gave strong indications they would plan to restore some of the millions of dollars cut by the House. Webb promised to revise his multi-billion-dollar space plans
again “and bring you the best program possible for the money.” (NASA lar VT/101; Text; Testimony; AP, NYT, 9/29/67, A3; 9/30/67, 52)

October 4: 10th anniversary of the space age, inaugurated with the launching of first man-made satellite, U.S.S.R.’s 184-lb Sputnik I. During first decade of space age 803 spacecraft were successfuly orbited: U.S. orbited 529; U.S.S.R., 269; France, 4; and Italy, 1. U.S. total included 14 manned orbital space flights with 677 orbits and 1,993.4 man hours; U.S.S.R. had 9 flights with 310 orbits and 532.5 man hours.
Of 45 worldwide flights related to the moon, 20 were successful— including 5 softlandings—providing high-quality photos and on-site analyses of lunar surface. Some 24 planetary flights provided close-up photos of Mars and atmospheric data on Mars and Venus. Some 17 bioscience payloads, including mice, dogs, mold spores, plants, insects, a chimpanzee, and an anthropomorphic dummy, were successfully launched and recovered, providing data on effects of space flight on living systems. Space applications satellites totaled 292; advanced technology satellites, 26; and military support and observation satellites, 158.

•To commemorate first decade of space age, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Interior S. Fred Singer, first Director of U.S. Weather Satellite program,
wrote in the Washington Post under dateline, “Oct. 4, 2007”: “It is now a half century since the first man-made satellite went into orbit around the earth, and an opportune time to examine how space technology and exploration have contributed to the economic development of the United States and to human welfare generally. The effects have been subtle— none of the early spectacular predictions have come to pass: the planets have been explored but not colonized; rockets have become more powerful but rocket transportation has not replaced aircraft and ramjet vehicles.” He cited three major technological changes as a result of space program: increased reliance on electronic computer and data processor; a managerial revolution which created highly trained technologist-managers; and increased understanding of natural environment.

Hoffman, naa Rocketdyne Div. president, on “. . . hardware failure, most . . . traceable to human error, inadequate manufacturing, quality control, or test procedures.”
NASA Hq. news conference, called at 5:00 pm same day by NASA Administrator James E. Webb, accompanied by key NASA and industry officials, responded to Rep. Ryan’s charges and explained that letter to Hoffman had been a case of normal Government-contractor business. Webb pointed out that subcommittees of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics were kept informed each month so that emergency matters could be brought to their attention.
Dr. von Braun explained how inspection and quality control procedures were continued as rocket engines were processed at contractor’s plant and at Government test sites. He stated that NASA-Rocketdyne coordination on inspection continuity and quality control were applied to both the rocket engine as an entity and the rocket engine/launch-vehicle-stage complex.
As trend of news conference discussion turned from quality control to Saturn/Apollo weight problems, m/g Samuel C. Phillips, Apollo Program Director, said the heavier Lunar Module resulted from fire-hazard-type design changes. He stated that lm was now 31,500 lb against a

October 5-6: jpl engineers conducted series of exercises with NASA’s Mariner IV spacecraft (launched Nov. 28, 1964) to demonstrate techniques for controlling Mariner V (launched June 14, 1967) if its startracker were to fail during Venus flyby Oct. 19. Mariner IV, after traveling more than 1.3-billion mi in solar orbit, successfully responded to commands by breaking lock on its unidentified guide star and locking instead on Canopus; breaking lock on Canopus; maintaining stability by turning on inertial control gyros for first time since December 1964; and pointing high-gain antenna toward earth and using it—with a 20-db signal strength increase at dsn ground stations—for first time since October 1965. Practice of procedures gave jpl engineers confidence in ability to stabilize Mariner V by gyros and to keep it oriented by ground command.

•	Vexing problem of the direction and period of Venus’ rotation had acquired
a new dimension in recent ultraviolet photographs, according to an article in Science by Bradford A. Smith of the New Mexico State Univ. Observatory. Smith recounted the history of 60 yrs of visual and spectroscopic observation of Venus that produced inconclusive evidence. Radar observation begun in 1961 by 1967 had produced what was considered firm evidence that the solid globe of Venus in 244 days rotated once in a direction retrograde to that of its planetary neighbors earth and Mars. Recent ultraviolet photos taken at the New Mexico State Univ. Observatory with a new 61-cm reflector indicated that ultraviolet clouds of the Venusian atmosphere rotated retrograde in five days. This large discrepancy between movement of the globe and atmosphere of Venus could be explained only by the existence in the Venusian atmosphere of a persistent and widespread planetary wind system blowing at more than 180 mph, Smith said. Although earth’s jet stream reached such speeds, it was narrow and zonal, in contrast to the massive system that would have to exist on Venus if these observations were correct. {Science, 10/6/67, 114r-6)
October 7: New York Times commented on congressional cuts in nasa’s FY 1968 budget: “The Senate, ignoring the most obvious of all opportunities to cut nonessential spending, has not only matched the $4.5 billion the House voted for space excursion but tacked on nearly $100 million more to start new programs after the first Americans land on the moon. The certainty that another huge space appropriation will come out of conference on Capitol Hill adds special interest to the fact that twice recently the leading space scientist of the Soviet Union, Prof. Leonid Sedov, has publicly stressed the importance of large-scale international cooperation for manned flights beyond the moon. . . . Now that Professor Sedov has opened the door, the Administration has an opportunity to begin diplomatic explorations to see if the Russians really are serious about replacing senseless rivalry in space with rational international cooperation.” {NYT, 10/7/67, 28)
Launches of military espionage spacecraft dominated U.S. space program, Soviet scientists Dr. V. Denisov and F. Soluyanov charged in Krasnaya Zvezda. According to the scientists, of 455 U.S. spacecraft launched by

How can we use modern technology to economize on that most essential and that most needed educational resource: the good teacher?” He added: “If future historians . , . seek, a name for this period in America, I hope they will give consideration to calling it the age of education. If our children’s children want to measure what we tried to achieve, I hope they will remember one thing: The American Government in only 3 years multiplied its commitment to education and to health four times over. Congress passed more laws and committed more funds to education and health in the last 3 years than in all previous history.” (PD, 10/16/67, 1419-23)
October 9: Sen. Joseph S. Clark (D-Pa.), member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Senate floor called proposed Nike-X ABM system “a very expensive flying ‘erector set’ ” and said that Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara was following an unwise course, “militarily, economically, and diplomatically. . . . Even if we were to spend forty billion dollars or more on a so-called massive system, the resulting increase in our security would be zero. . . . The result would he a waste of a great deal of money . . at a critical time. He cited three flaws in arguments supporting abm system: (1) justification based on approaching threat of Communist Chinese nuclear tipped missiles (“We have the capacity to devastate China many times over . . . and the Chinese know that,” he said); (2) assumption that a thin abm system would be effective against Communist China for any appreciable period; and (3) assumption that during so-called safe period in Chinese nuclear development, U.S., behind an abm defense, would be genuinely safe from nuclear attack. “The inevitable conclusion,” Senator Clark noted, “is that the proposed . . . system simply will not do the job which its proponents say it will do.” (Text; CR, 10/9/67, S14413-27)

October 10: President Johnson, in White House ceremony marking entry into force of space law treaty, greeted ambassadors from 13 countries and key U.S. officials and renewed America’s offer to cooperate fully with any nation in exploring planets and solar system, using tracking facilities, mapping the earth, exchanging bioscientific information, and communicating via comsats.
Responding, Soviet Ambassador Anatoli F. Dobrynin said: “These [international legal] principles . . . are aimed at insuring peaceful activities of states in outer space for the benefit of all mankind. We hope that [the treaty] will contribute to the settlement of major international problems still facing the mankind on our planet.”
British Ambassador Sir Patrick Dean said: “We welcome [the treaty] all the more because the treaty removes outer space from the effect of the rivalry and dissension between nations. ... It is a treaty about . . . rule of law and the extension of that field within which international law is to regulate the conflicts of interests, which arise between men and nations.”

•	Sen. Henry M- Jackson (D-Wash.) expressed concern about U.S. de-
fense policy in speech to the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace meeting at Stanford Univ. He cited three specific ideas with which he disagreed: (1) exaggerated picture of U.S. as catalyst in Soviet desire to “possess a first-rate military establishment,” (2) theory that military technology had reached a plateau and stabilized, and (3) seeming trend toward nuclear parity. Some scientists and defense planners, he said, had “a mirror image interpretation of Moscow’s decisions . . . seeing them as reflex actions” and believed that if U.S. did not act U.S.S.R. would not act. He also argued, “Ordinary economic technology is always finding better ways to do things and there is no reason to suppose that military technology will cease in this effort.” Sen. Jackson believed that “international peace and security depend not on a parity of power but on a preponderance of power in the peace-keepers over the peace-upsetters. Our aim is not ... an unlimited accumulation of weapons . . . [but] to create and maintain ... a relationship of forces favorable to the deterrent of adventurism and aggression.” (Text)

It added that “recent statements by the Soviet Union’s leading space scientist, Professor Leonid Sedov, indicate that the Russians too may be coming around to the conclusion that the costs of going it alone to the moon and beyond outweigh the dimming propaganda magic.” (NYT, 10/11/67)
•	Jonathan Spivak in Wall Street Journal commented on congressional cuts
in NASA’s FY 1968 budget: “Plans to launch unmanned satellites to Mars or Venus in 1971 and 1973 and conduct extended exploration of the moon by astronauts face probable abandonment because of a lack of funds. There will also be sharp curtailment of proposals for long-duration manned flights in orbit about the earth to enhance the nation’s space technology and exploit practical and scientific applications of space. Thus, say space officials, the present outlook is that only a limited national space program will continue in the 1970s after the lunar landing.” (Spivak, WSJ, 10/11/67, 24)

Discussing space law treaty [effective Oct. 10] after making announcements, Webb said it was a valuable further advance of the rule of law into spaee but noted that laws could be broken. “We have an agreement in the Antarctic . . . not to introduce military operations or equipment and this has worked well. . . . We now have this agreement in space, and . . . the most important enforcer of these that relate to space technology is momentum and continued development of technology. The forward capability is what in essence has produced cooperation when we have had it. . . . [U.S.S.R.] and other nations must recognize that they’re not going to have a monopoly in this field. [Our being] . . . there is the most important way to make sure we get the benefits of the treaty.

Inquiry into economic impact of building sst was made by Dael Wolfle in Science editorial. Congressional arguments on whether to build sst “illustrate why members of Congress want to increase congressional competence to assess the consequences of technological developments and proposals. . . . What Congress needs in deciding about the sst or other technological matters is essentially what it needs in deciding about taxes, military affairs, education, or other matters with which it deals: ability to ask the right questions and ability to evaluate critically the information it receives from advocates and opponents of proposed actions.” (Wolfle, Science, 10/13/67)
•	In its fourth year of full operation ESRO was entering a more expensive
and ambitious phase and consequently was encountering financial, political, and organizational difficulties, John Walsh reported in Science. esro was currently appraising its eight-year program and seeking ways to coordinate its activities with ELDO, European Conference on Communications Satellites (gets), and new European Space Conference. According to 1962 convention which became effective in 1964, esro was to have launched 300 sounding rockets and 10-12 satellites within eight years under $300-million budget. Although esro council was empowered to adjust budget authorization in response to major scientific and technical developments, it lacked unanimity necessary for change. As a result, Walsh noted, scheduled number of satellites—including $170-million Large Astronomical Satellite (las)—would probably not be launched. Expenditures for buildings and equipment for esro’s new four-station satellite tracking, telemetry, and telecommand network, and its five main research installations had been particularly heavy. European Space Technology Center (estec), for example, responsible for applied research and payload development, had a 456-man staff—nearly half of total esro staff—which was expected to reach 1,000 by the end of
1967.	In addition to financial problems caused by expansion, Walsh said, esro had to overcome a sensitivity to what national aerospace industries would get back in relation to national contributions, differences over selection of projects, and lack of unity and coordinated effort. Differences of opinion between larger countries such as U.K., Germany, and France, which contributed 23.13%, 24.31%, and 20.17%, respectively, to esro budget, and smaller countries such as Denmark, which contributed 2.15%, had to be resolved before a real sense of purpose could be acquired, Walsh said, “esro until now has been primarily an agency providing technical services and support for university scientists who prepare actual experiments. As experiments grow more complex, more work will be done in esro labs and by industry,” and new dimensions would be added to its tasks. (Walsh, Science, 10/13/67, 242-4)

• Christian Science Monitor, commenting on space law treaty which went into effect Oct. 10, noted that space exploration had evolved this treaty which banned military installations and nuclear weapons from moon and planets and which could evolve into space cooperation between U.S. and U.S.S.R. Treaty did not halt use of reconnaissance satellites but it provided for international inspection of vehicles and installations on moon and other bodies. Although there would be no right of inspection to see whether satellites were carrying nuclear weapons, and vigilance would always be vital in this regard, treaty was one more visible proof that Moscow and Washington could make useful progress. Space law treaty was agreement, following Antarctic Treaty, which could remove installations of war from one more section of mankind’s expanding environment. (CSM, 10/14/67)

October 15: JPL announced development of double vacuum chamber, designed by jpl’s James B. Stephens, to simulate extreme effects of interplanetary space on spacecraft. Called Molsink (molecular sink of outer space), chamber was expected to determine what happened to paint, components, and even microorganisms on spacecraft. The eight-foot-dia chamber would be capable of capturing 99.97% of all condensable molecules emanating from test item by freezing the molecules to the walls at — 400° F with super-cold helium gas. Conventional vacuum chambers had not been able to pump, or capture, more than half of gas molecules flying off test item. Space scientists believed Molsink chamber would provide reliable tool to measure and counteract problem of spacecraft out-gassing. In testing, long periods would simulate actual flight time of spacecraft to planets—four months to Venus, seven months to Mars, for example. The chamber was expected to be fully operational early in 1968, when testing would be stepped up for nasa’s Mariner Mars 1969 exploration program. ( jpl Release 459)

•	Three possible military reasons why U.S.S.R. used one-orbit spacecraft
in Cosmos series during period from Sept. 17, 1966, through Aug. 8, 1967, when seven were launched, were suggested by Phillip J. Klass in Aviation Week: launches evaluated (1) missile defense radars and icbm penetration aids, (2) very-long-range icbm attacking from south, or (3) orbital weapon. Other reasons had been noted—including test of recovery systems for Soyuz manned spacecraft. In all cases, a principal object reentered after one orbit and other objects after a day or two. Soviets had never mentioned orbital period nor had they explained low perigee of 90 mi—an indication spacecraft would remain in space for only one orbit or less.
Orbital weapon theory was also suggested by Evert Clark, in New York Times: “Most analysts . . . now believe the flights are exploring the techniques of bringing down a nuclear warhead from an orbiting platform.” [Such tests would not violate space law treaty which became effective Oct. 10, he said, because treaty did not prohibit engineering tests necessary to station weapons in orbit. Nor would it prohibit nuclear armed flights that were less than one full orbit, as these were.]

• The five-out-of-five successful missions of $200-million Lunar Orbiter project to photograph moon to aid in selecting Surveyor and Apollo landing sites and to contribute to scientific knowledge of moon were reviewed at NASA Hq. press conference. Photographic data provided by Lunar Orbiter I, II, and III and Surveyor I resulted in selection of eight candidate sites. Lunar Orbiter IV provided basis for extending cartographic grid system for front-face mapping around to moon’s hidden side by photographing eastern limb areas. Lunar Orbiter V photographed scientifically interesting areas on moon’s front side, completed farside coverage, and provided supplementary photography of potential Apollo landing sites.
Apollo Program Director, m/g Samuel C. Phillips, said that, when “approaching on a pretty flat trajectory at about 30 miles from the landing site . . . details of the topography and the radar return which is coupled into the automatic control and landing system [must be known].” In planning details of approach and landing maneuvers, Phillips said that “a very great deal” had been learned from Orbiter “about the rather unusual light conditions and; the effect of light reflections from the lunar surface under various angles.”
Harold Masursky, usgs, explained Lunar Orbiter photographs showed that “apparently the earth and the Moon are very similar in their distribution of high and low ground.” He hoped that “by examination and comparison of ... geologic plot with the selenodetic information . . . [from] the Orbiter series, we will be able to plot the geopotential field . . . and tie it in with geology. ... By studying the Moon we know that it has a long, complex geologic history, that many of the same kinds of things that happen on the earth happen on the Moon. We can now play these two against each other, compare their simulari-ties, contrast their differences, and perhaps'be able to arrive at a greater understanding of the fundamental processes that affect the earth.”
Strange moon features looking like watercourses might be dry-gulch arroyos, Harold Spradley said. Because watercourses had originated in volcanic craters and carried “fluidal materials,” volcano’s output— possibly slurry of ash and water—would exist long enough to cut its way through dry lunar surface material. Scientists agreed that orthodox existence of water on “the airless moon” was improbable.
Clifford Nelson, LaRC Lunar Orbiter Project Manager, described results of experiments: “. . . density distribution [very nearly homogeneous] in the moon now seems to be resolved . . . center of mass of the moon is displaced toward the earth from the center of its geometrical figure, a situation which would have interesting scientific implications as to the stability of the moon and its origin and history.” Meteoroid penetration rate “in the region covered by lunar orbiter spacecraft is less than one-half the rate in the near earth environment. . . .’’ He said all 13 MSFN stations had successfully tracked and communicated with lunar orbiter, and “orbit determination programs ... in the initial stages of checkout. . . will continue with Lunar Orbiter V.”
nasa Associate Administrator Dr. Homer E. Newell stressed overall significance of Lunar Orbiter program: “Before the first Lunar Orbiter mission this country had never placed spacecraft into orbit about any other celestial body other than the earth. In all five . . . missions, the spacecraft were not only placed into initial orbits as desired, but then the orbits were changed in accordance with a plan ... set up before-
hand, in ... a precision type of operation. . . . Lunar Orbiter and its companion, Surveyor, have shown that we can use sophisticated technology in complicated spacecraft for automated missions to other bodies of the solar system. And it is this kind of capability that we will be using again and again as we continue the exploration of our solar system.” (Transcript)
•	NASA’s Mariner V would fly within 2,500 mi of planet Venus at 1.34 pm
edt, Oct. 19, at communications (direct) distance of about 49 million mi from earth, NASA announced. Launched from etr June 14, spacecraft would have traveled about 217 million mi in its arching trajectory. Scientists and engineers hoped their instruments would record precise data on planet’s atmosphere, ionosphere, temperatures, and perhaps even surface qualities. As Mariner V approached Venus, its scientific instruments would begin measuring planet’s magnetic field, charged particles, gases present in upper atmosphere, and radiation levels. Spacecraft’s flight path would curve behind Venus and would vanish from view of tracking stations on earth. Just before spacecraft went behind planet (as seen from earth) its radio signals would pass through atmosphere of Venus. Effect of Venusian atmosphere on Mariner Vs radio signals would be measured, thereby providing measure of density of planet’s atmosphere. Current scientific theory on density ranged from five times earth’s atmosphere to several hundred times. Density measurement by occultation was one of prime objectives of spacecraft’s flight.
Since launch of spacecraft, engineering and science subsystems had performed as planned. Master timer had-commanded Canopus cone angle update as scheduled on Aug. 24, Sept. 10, Sept. 26, and Oct. 10; timer had also commanded spacecraft transmitter to switch to high-gain antenna on Oct. 2.

•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb reviewed nasa-university relations at
dedication of Univ. of Illinois’ Coordinated Science Laboratory building in Urbana, 111.: “During NASA’s first year of operation . . . [$3 million] was invested in research at universities. . . . The second year, approximately $6 million went to universities, and the third year about $14 million . . . [primarily for] solution of immediate problems. . . .” Appraisal of program in 1961 concluded the universities were already making significant contribution to the space program, but that with the right kind of help they could do more for themselves and for NASA. Expansion included support of research, construction of facilities, and establishment of graduate fellowships, until program reached peak in 1966 with 10,600 campus participants. Today, however, need was “to reduce expenditures for research, to preserve at minimum cost the essential strength needed for the future, and to increase the multidisciplinary flux that will magnify the values the nation can derive from the activities we can support.” To find the best ways of reducing the program, he said, nasa had formed a “special task force to evaluate all our relationships with the academic community and to come up with specific recommendations as to least harmful methods we can use. There is no longer any doubt that NASA’s university support programs will have to be redefined quite drastically in some areas.” Since much of the program was funded in three one-year steps, this would help
spread the impact over a longer time period. Ph. D. candidates now holding NASA grants would be able to obtain their degrees. Looking to the future, Webb urged the universities to think, reorganize, and work in interdisciplinary groupings. “The development of a few university teams working together across the traditional disciplines, combining the best efforts of technology, the social sciences and management capability which they have created and which make them the best available source of trusted information in our society can write a new chapter of history of problem solving in this nation.” (Text)

It is, of course, not unusual for a military aircraft that uses advanced state-of-the-art to fail to meet some of the specifications, the real question is whether it meets military needs.” He added: “. . . we find that it meets our fleet air defense requirements better than any competing system available for study.” (Text)

October 18: nasa’s Oso IV (oso-d) Orbiting Solar Observatory was successfully launched from etr with three-stage Thor-Delta booster to study the sun and its influence on earth’s atmosphere. Orbital parameters: apogee, 358.8 mi (577 km); perigee, 336.7 mi (542km); period, 95.8 min; and inclination, 32.9°. Fourth of eight spacecraft in NASA’s oso program to provide direct observation of the sun during most of an 11-yr solar cycle, Oso IV weighed 599 lbs, carried nine experiments, was designed for a six-month lifetime, and had two main sections: the wheel (lower) section provided stability by gyroscopic spinning and housed the telemetry-command equipment, batteries, electronic controls, gas spin-control arms, and six experiment packages; the sail (upper) section was oriented toward the sun and contained solar cells and three solar pointing experiments.
Primary purpose of Oso IV was to obtain high-resolution spectral data within the range lA-1350A from pointed solar experiments in the spacecraft during major portion of one solar rotation and adequate operational support of spacecraft subsystems including raster scan of solar disk to carry out acquisition of these scientific data. Secondary objective was to obtain useful data from nonpointed experiments and from pointed experiments during more than one solar rotation. Experiments, designed to continue and extend work of Oso I (launched March 7, 1962), Oso II (launched Feb. 3, 1965), and Oso III (launched March 8,1967) by collecting data on solar x-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet radiation, and other solar activity, were provided by two American and two British universities, one U.S. Government agency, and one private company. Oso IV was first in series to carry foreign experiments and second (Oso II was the first) capable of scanning entire solar surface by means of a Solar Ultraviolet Scanning Spectrometer which could record a “picture” (digital number) of the sun and transmit it to receiving stations. Spacecraft also had an improved ground-control system whichjpermitted it to receive up to 140 different commands—compared to 10 for Oso /, 70 for Oso II, and 94 for Oso III. Project officials at GSFC reported that satellite spin rate, power level, charge rate, and temperatures were normal and that both tape recorders were operating; all experiments were fully operational by Oct. 25. oso program was managed by GSFC under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 67—262)
• U.S.S.R.’s Venus IV planetary probe (also designated Venera IV) entered atmosphere of planet Venus at 12:34 am edt and ejected instrumented capsule intended for softlanding on Venus. After aerodynamic braking, automatic parachute system provided gradual descent through 15-mi dense, hot, windy atmosphere, and capsule made [purported] softlanding at 2:08 am edt. Mstislav Keldysh, President of Soviet Academy of Sciences, later presented scientific proof for softlanding [see Oct. 30]. Launched June 12, the 2,438-lb Venus IV had traveled trajectory of more than 210 million mi; 49 million mi would be covered by transmitted signals from capsule to earth antennas.
According to Soviet scientists, atmosphere as recorded by instrumented capsule had almost whole carbon dioxide composition with about 1.5% oxygen and water vapors; no significant traces of nitrogen; and a temperature range of 104-536° F. Reports indicated no noticeable magnetic field and no radiation belt, but detectable weak hydrogen corona. “Because Venus rotates so slowly around its axis [purported to be once in 244 earth days] half the planet is cold,” said Soviet scientist Josif Shklovski. Because the other half heated to “monstrous temperature,” he said surface of Venus would appear to be “a dry hot desert.” He noted that temperature extremes would cause constant winds on Venus “of about 450 mph” [accounting for large amount of drift of capsule during descent].
Moscow news reports from Izvestia and Tass said: Venus IV’s mission had been accomplished and instruments had ceased functioning after radioing data from softlanding site on heat, pressure, and carbon dioxide hostile to most forms of life; mother spacecraft burned in Venus’ atmosphere. Some reports did not claim softlanding. Soviet astronomer Vitali Bronshtein’s claim that radio contact was being maintained with instrumented capsule was unconfirmed. Also, cessation of signals from instrumented capsule received varied explanations from international
sources. Tass reported antenna of package had failed to point in the right direction and that package’s bulk had blocked direct contact with earth. Jodrell Bank Observatory Director Sir Bernard Lovell expressed doubt that any electronic device could withstand high temperatures on Venusian surface.

Citing increasing “Government concern for the involvement of science and technology in the welfare and security of the American people,” he said it was increasingly obvious that science and technology, a prime source of many environmental problems, must be means by which they are solved. He also called for realism in minimizing influence of competition between political philosophies on implementation of scientific knowledge for human problems. “We must direct more and more attention ... to the effects of urbanization, such as the pollution of air, water and the land, the practical control of population, to offsetting the constantly decreasing supply of natural resources such as fresh water, arable land, and fuels.” (Text)

All scientific instruments and spacecraft subsystems performed properly during encounter sequence, as they had throughout flight. Sequence of 15 significant events during encounter, occultation, closest approach, exit occultation, and return to cruise mode, had begun at 10:49 pm edt Oct. 18 and had ended at 3:55 am edt Oct. 23. Full recorded account of experiments performed by Mariner V—first and second playbacks— exhibited clear and steady signals, jpl scientists obtained meaningful scientific data from all of spacecraft’s experiments.
Results of experiments included: solar plasma probe and magnetometer showed existence of solar wind/Venus interaction; trapped radiation found no energetic particles or radiation belts, and found magnetic moment less than 1% of earth’s; S-band occultation estimated carbon
dioxide and found ionospheric observations on daytime side indicated electron density; dual-frequency radio propagation provided data on Venus mass as 81.50% of earth’s mass, and astronomical unit determination agreed with radar computations; and ultraviolet photometer found hydrogen corona comparable with that of earth, detected no oxygen, and found night airglow to be very faint ultraviolet emission detected at dark limb of planet—probably result of chemical reactions, particle bombardment of electrical discharge. Spacecraft’s mission also was to accumulate data on interplanetary environment during period of increased solar activity. After return to cruise mode, Mariner V would resume report on interplanetary space weather. By end of November 1967, when earth was no longer in direction of high-gain antenna pattern, communications would be terminated; however, three-month-duration communications would be possible during next five years.

•	Cone-shaped RAM C-l spacecraft was successfully launched from NASA
Wallops Station by four-stage Scout booster at 1:33 pm, edt. On termination of eight-minute ballistic flight, impact occurred 725 mi down-range about 150 nm northeast of Bermuda. Spacecraft, 15 in long and 26 in in dia with 12-in-di^ hemisphere nose, plunged hack into earth’s atmosphere at 17,000 rnph in flight test to study methods for preventing loss of radio .signals from reentering spacecraft. No recovery was attempted.
NASA’s Project RAM (Radio Attenuation Measurement) was to measure effectiveness of water addition concept in maintaining communications during reentry. Additional experiments were also included to evaluate X-band telemetry system as a means of overcoming blackout: study plasma and ablation effects on antenna performance; measure attenuation as a function of signal frequency; and obtain measurements of ion densities in the flow field of the spacecraft in the presence of ablation and water injection.
Water was injected at three points on spacecraft—on nose cap and on each side—with nitrogen gas as pressurizing agent. Ion density changes, due to varying amounts of water injection, were measured. X-band frequency experiment showed blackout period of communications was reduced by 6 sec, using water-injection method.
Series of Arcasonde meteorological rockets were launched from Bermuda before and after RAM C-l experiment to collect upper atmosphere density, temperature, and wind data, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 67261; WS Releases 67-33,67-34)

•	Fast growth of air travel market could be adversely affected by travel costs,
lack of hotel space, unreasonable airport charges, and unnecessary restrictions on operating rights of U.S. carriers abroad, Air Transport Assn, of America’s President Stuart G. Tipton told Dublin, Ireland, audience. Addressing Trans-Atlantic Travel Congress of European Travel Commission, he suggested that “serious consideration be given to the effect upon airlines of high airport costs,” while he pointed out that, since 1946, average fare per passenger mile had dropped 38 percent. Referring to “the [Boeing] 747 era [as being] a little over two years away,” he warned that “the lead time for building a new hotel, however, runs from three to five years.” Air passengers from the U.S. alone had spent $773 million in the Europe-Mediterranean area and had contributed to the economic well-being of the area; however, he said, “U.S. flag carriers are paying $500 . . . for every landing at some European airports [while] their foreign flag counterparts flying into the U.S. pay only $90 per landing for the same aircraft.” (Text)
•	Injectors for Apollo Lunar Module’s ascent engine had performed in over

Injectors had returned automatically to stable combustion after explosive charge was set off to deliberately create rough combustion in several tests. They were developed as backup to the original injectors after rough combustion was noted in test firings. Three designs would be continued through feasibility testing; then the best design would be chosen for development. (Rocketdyne Release)

October 23: NASA announced that primary mission objectives of Biosatellite II (launched Sept. 7) had been accomplished. Biological experiments had been conducted to investigate synergistic and antagonistic effects of weightlessness and controlled gamma radiation aboard attitude-controlled spacecraft. Spacecraft recovery—essential to success—had been completed as planned. Environmental control of capsule and experiment packages had kept organisms alive while radiation source was exposed for flight duration. Dr. Rudolph H. T. M^ttoni, principal investigator for bacteria experiment, said bacteria had increased 20 to 30% faster in weightless condition. He concluded “cellular turnover may be higher in man” during weightlessness and could be harmful to astronauts during long-duration space flights. He suggested that if further research proved growth of human cells to be faster in weightless state, future spacecraft might have to be equipped with some form of artificial gravity or astronauts might have to carry drugs to prevent too-rapid turnover of their body cells. Since the 45-hr experiment with bacteria equaled many years of human life, this would not be significant on flights of a few weeks or even a few months. The pepper plant experiment showed abnormal growth, indicating that plant leaves also depend on gravity. Other experiments did not show significant change and were still being analyzed, (nasa Proj Off; AP, NYT, 10/15/67,46)

•	Rep. James G. Fulton (R-Pa.), ranking minority member of House Com-
mittee on Science and Astronautics, during debate on NASA appropriations bill on floor of House, said: “China is now proceeding with the development of a rocket with nuclear propulsion. The Chinese nuclear rocket program is based upon a nuclear reactor through which passes liquid hydrogen that is stored in the rocket. This same fuel . •. . is also used as a coolant for the nozzle of the rocket.” He also said Communist Chinese “are proceeding with the development of a sounding rocket called Caditi . . . [and] telecommunications satellites.”
He explained that Communist Chinese believe, “to operate successfully in space, big booster power, high energy fuels, and nuclear propulsion are necessary. The University of Nanking ... is conducting training courses in various applications of rocket programs. The Chinese space research center of Sinkiang now has programs in the study of materials necessary for space experiments. In addition, it should be seriously considered that the Chinese rocket institute— Balon Roditi—is interested in the development of rockets ‘for all purposes.’ This, of course, includes military as well as peaceful uses. Peking is not a signatory to the recent peace treaty for the peaceful uses of outer space. . . .
“The nations of the West, including Russia, should not underestimate Chinese competence in these matters and the pace of their research and development programs. The U.S. Government and the American people must be alerted to the swift progress of the Red Chinese nation in space research and development, high energy propulsion, and large boosters . . . [and they] must realize the tremendous advances being made in the Red Chinese nuclear research field. ... It is my belief and prediction that the [Communist] Chinese will orbit . . . [their] first . . . satellite by January 1968. . . .” {CR, 10/23/67, H13785-93)
•	U.S.S.R.’s intensified study of near-earth environment indicated their scien-
tists planned long-duration manned orbital flights, reported Aviation Week. Two investigations were cited: Cosmos CLXVI, launched June 16, in near-earth radiation study for protection of future cosmonauts in orbit during high sunspot activity; and “vertical cosmic probe,” reaching altitude of 2,734 mi on study of upper atmospheric layers, ionosphere, and near-earth space. The “vertical cosmic probe,” launched Oct. 12, provided Soviets with information on electron and positive ion concentrations, general intensity of cosmic rays, and radiation doses through various types of protection during flight within radiation belts. Cosmos CLXVI satellite provided solar flare data for continuous three months.
Similar to these Soviet studies were those conducted using NASA’s Oso IV (launched Oct. 18), which would monitor sun so scientists could better determine how phenomena such as radio “blackout” and weather on earth were affected by solar activity. (Av Wk, 10/23/67, 27-8; NASA Release 67-273)

Reviewing history of naca and NASA, giss Executive Officer Arthur L. Levine noted that forces which accounted for creation of naca in 1915 were both different from and far less intense that those behind creation of NASA in 1958. NASA played a much more significant role in the Nation and in Federal activity in science and technology than naca, he said, and NASA’s leadership was subjected to a wider variety and greater intensity of pressures from within Government and from outside interests.
NASA Historian Eugene M. Emme reviewed historical evolution of U.S. aeronautics and astronautics in context of major national policies and decisions.

GSFC engineers F. 0. Vonbun and J. T. Mengel proposed development of a worldwide tracking and communications system for manned planetary missions similar to that used for Apollo. Planetary Manned Space Flight Network (pmsfn)—consisting of three 30- to 50--ft-dia ground stations, three 210-ft-dia dish antennas, and three synchronous orbiting tracking stations (sots)—would obviate need for other radar, ships, and aircraft, sots, they said, while providing continuous communications, tracking, and telemetry functions, would be more cost-efficient by removing requirement for numerous new tracking stations.

Addressing Honors Banquet, use President Dr. Norman Topping stressed need for expanded program to search and disseminate data produced in space research. Although such data did reach social problems occasionally, “the arrival in the right place at the right time is largely a coincidence,” he noted. To realize the total potential of modern discovery, scientists had to communicate outside their separate, narrow fields, find a common language with the layman, and work together
to “find places for their discoveries within the social, ethical, and moral framework of our civilization.” (Text)
Princeton Univ. economics professor Oskar Morgenstem, participating in President’s Forum, “The Worth of the Space Program,” contended that the space effort, as a public investment of natural resources, had to be evaluated by comparing its benefits with other ways the resources could have been used. Although no basic discoveries as important as atomic fission, the transistor, or the laser could be attributed to space exploration, he said, U.S. could still afford a high degree of space exploration and could expect discoveries “of a magnitude that will astonish even this generation which has seen so much and is prepared to expect that our knowledge will increase without limit.”
Dr. T. Keith Glennan, President of Associated Universities, Inc., and first NASA Administrator, submitted that the most important enduring contribution of the space endeavor to U.S. future was education. Progress in higher education, he said, had occurred as a result of the compelling challenge of space exploration along with nasa’s “clear and evident desire to assure an adequate flow of highly trained manpower. . . Current statistics on NASA investments in higher education were very impressive, he noted, but if NASA’s budget were trimmed further its support to education would have to be diminished.
Dr. Willard F. Libby of ucla predicted that space program would “come out to be the best bargain the American people have ever made— both for its practical value in technological developments, and for its contributions to pure knowledge through science.” Space program had already contributed to and answered questions about geosciences, interplanetary sciences, astronomy, and chemistry but most consuming question was that of extraterrestrial life in solar system.

[has become] one of the world’s most ambitious attempts to pool the talents and learning of thousands. ...
“. . . nasa has been doing pioneering work of immense significance to modern society that has nothing to do with the exploration of space per se. Objectives have been defined, scientific and technical knowledge and talent have been collected, trained and aimed at research objectives and results produced. That is a massive accomplishment of human engineering . . . [and] an inspiration to all of us. . . . Just how much ... is transferable to other situations remains to be seen, but ... it certainly is not inconceivable that what we have learned, and what we will learn, about public administration from NASA may, in the long pull, mean every bit as much as the scientific and technological developments from the exploration of space itself.”

•	Overall NASA aeronautics program was undergoing “expansion and change
to meet the ever growing needs” of air transportation industry and general aviation, NASA Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., told the Aero Club in Washington, D.C.: “Less than 1400 direct man-years were applied to our aeronautical effort in 1962 and only $15 million in r&d funding was applied to support their activities. The trend has now been clearly reversed and in [FY 1967] twice the manpower (27.2 directs) and three times the funding ($45.7 million) were applied to NASA’s aeronautical program.” Although FY 1968 program had not been clarified, NASA planned to increase aeronautical R&D funding to $81.4 million, he said.
Major aeronautical advances in the past had been exploited by dod, he noted, which bore development costs and proved out designs before adoption by commercial aviation. Since solutions for many problems could no longer rely heavily on precursor military development, NASA would continue NASA-established role to conduct broadly applicable basic aeronautical research and solve specific problems with reimbursement for special costs. In addition, Dr. Seamans said, NASA would attempt to reduce aircraft noise by modifying engines on existing aircraft, developing quieter engines, and revising operational procedures;, cooperate with faa and industry to solve safety and utility problems of general aviation; and conduct extensive r&d programs for v/stol, supersonic, and hypersonic aircraft.

•	Fred Friendly, Columbia University professor and consultant to Ford
Foundation, delivering Granada Lecture in London, warned that communications satellites’ promise of international “common market” of high-quality TV was threatened by commercial and government avarice. In U.S., he said, TV “can make so much'money doing its worst, it cannot afford to do its best.” Consequence had been that early promise of quality programs had been lost while educational TV, which could fill breach, had been “under-funded, undernourished and under-observed.” But even in nations where TV was nationalized, tendency would be for governments to seek profits from it to offset other communications deficits, he said. Thus, he argued, “a promising world village, linked by satellites,” could be turned into “an electronic slum,” because ambitious corporations and separate governments insisted on going their own ways, concerned more with earnings, national appetites, and images than with what their satellite systems carried. What was required, he suggested, was “an electronic Magna Charta” guaranteeing rights of public to quality TV. (Friendly, W Post, 10/25/67, D14)

October 25—27: Mariner IV, launched Nov. 28, 1964, responded to a series of commands 56 million mi out in space after three years in orbit. On Oct. 25, the spacecraft was commanded to switch data rate from 8Ys to 33Ys bps (bits per sec); receive via low-gain antenna; reorient spacecraft so high-gain antenna pointed directly at earth; change to allengineering data format; and bum midcourse guidance engine for 70 sec. On Oct. 26, commands were sent to actuate planetary scan subsystem and tape recorder. Lines 139 through 199 of picture No. 16 and lines 1 through 59 of picture No. 17 were played back. Initial indications were that photographic data were the same as when first reported July 14, 1965. On Oct. 27, spacecraft responded to commands to test certain redundant equipment—such as transmitter and attitude-control apparatus—and was placed in normal cruise condition by acquiring Canopus. Attitude-control gas in one section of system was thought to be depleted, leaving about 0.2 lb in other section. This would last until early December; when gas was depleted, Mariner IV would no longer he able to retain its orientation with respect to the sun and Canopus.
JPL scientists were “delighted” with the firing of midcourse guidance engine, and with transmission of pictures of Mars taken by Mariner IV more than two years ago. Scientists reported “a flawless burn . . . [which] proved we can restart engines in space years after we’ve put them there.” Future spacecraft, exploiting this success, could be launched to distant planets where they could take close-up photographs, swing back toward earth, and, on command, transmit pictures.
Mariner IV had taken pictures of Mars from an altitude of 5,500 mi; 21 frames had been exposed and recorded on magnetic tape to be telemetered to earth over a 10-day period.

October 26: First flight test of Saturn V, designated Apollo 4, was scheduled no earlier than Nov. 7, announced m/g Samuel C. Phillips, Apollo Program Director. “This is a target date,” he said. “We are in a very complex learning process and we are going to take all the time we need on this first launch.” Launch vehicle and Apollo spacecraft combination was 363 ft tall and weighed 6 million lbs. Thrust of Saturn V’s first stage was 7.5 million lbs. Key objective of flight planned for Nov. 7 would be evaluation of Apollo command module heat shield under conditions encountered on return from moon mission. Flight would also test thermal seals for use in new quick-release spacecraft hatch which would be installed on all manned Apollo missions.
Apollo 4 flight plan would call for Saturn V to place spacecraft and launch yehicle 3rd stage (S-IVB) into 117-mi circular orbit. After completing two orbits, 3rd stage would he re-ignited to place spacecraft into orbit with apogee of 10,800 mi. After separation from 3rd stage, service module propulsion system would be fired to rafee spacecraft apogee to 11,400 mi. During descent the service module motor would fire again, boosting velocity of spacecraft to about 25,000 mph, the reentry speed of a lunar return flight, (nasa Release 67-274; B Sun, 10/26/67, A6) • GSFC officials completed week of checkout of Oso IV and turned on last of

Report approved $3,925 billion for R&D, decrease of $152.1 million from authorization and decrease of $356.5 million from budget; report approved $35.9 million for Construction of Facilities, decrease of $14.6 million from authorization, and decrease of $21.3 million from budget; report approved $628.0 million for Administrative Operations, decrease of $20.2 million from authorization, and decrease of $43.3 million from budget.
Rep. James G. Fulton (R-Pa.), ranking minority member of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, on floor of House, said that “Voyager and nerva II programs should be funded this fiscal year. Voyager is the only major planetary exploration program this Nation will have in the 1970’s. If this program is abandoned, we will be abdicating our responsibilities. . . . This is particularly significant following the recent Russian Venus IV soft landing on the planet Venus.”
Sen. Gordon L. Allott (R-Col.), ranking minority member of Senate Committee on Appropriations’ Space Appropriations Subcommittee, was forced to accept no specific funding for Voyager and Nerva programs (in final version) but said in statement read by Sen. Margaret C. Smith (R-Me.) on floor of Senate that “agreement was reached to add $15.5 million to [r&d] over the House figure.” He added that the agreement would provide that NASA’s Administrator “may reprogram funds . . . with approval of the appropriate committees of the Congress.” He added: “. . . conferees share this belief, that this country must move ahead now in [r&d] leading to interplanetary exploration.” (CR, 10/26/67, H14036-8, S15405-8)
•	Dr. Harvey H. Nininger, leading authority on meteorites and tektites, was
honored at Meteoritical Society’s 30th annual meeting at arc by publication of special issue of the Journal of the Geochemical Society and by presentation of Society’s annual Leonard Medal. First to propose, in 1940, that tektites came from moon, Dr. Nininger later proved that coesite—a quartz-like material created by very high pressures—could be found in meteoroid craters. Presence of coesite was currently being used to determine whether a crater was formed by meteorite impact (arc Release 67—21)
Qctober 27: NASA Aerobee 150 sounding rocket launched from wsmr reached 99-mi (160-km) altitude in flight to measure, with moderate and high resolution, spectral irradiance of Venus (1,000 to 3,000 A), and star B Oriones (Rigel). No data were acquired from Venus because tracker was ineffective; Rigel was acquired and five-second exposure sequence was completed. (NASARptSRL)

October 29: U.S.S.R. would “shortly” launch a manned spacecraft which might land outside Soviet territory—possibly in India—Soviet Ambassador to India Nikolai M. Pagov told reporters in Madras, India, according to AP. Permission to recover spacecraft in India had been requested and granted in early September, he said. Official U.S. sources, noting that several other countries had been approached for such permission, speculated that an unmanned rehearsal for a manned circum-lunar flight had been scheduled for late September and postponed because of technical problems. Oct. 27 launches of Cosmos CLXXXVI and Cosmos CLXXXVII—-which were apparently Soyuz-type spacecraft—could be “practice shots” for the planned manned flight.

Cosmos CLXXXVIII entered orbit with 276-km (171-mi) apogee, 200-km (124-mi) perigee, 89-min period, and 52° inclination. At 4:20 am, edt, spacecraft was automatically docked with Cosmos CLXXXVI (launched Oct. 27). Tass later announced: “. . . both satellites, equipped with special approach and docking units, carried out a number of complicated maneuvers in space, automatically finding each other, drawing closer, berthing and docking rigidly.” It was history’s first automatic docking in space and was filmed by TV cameras onboard both satellites. U.S. had successfully accomplished first manned docking March 16, 1966, with Gemini VII and Gemini Agena Target Vehicle (gatv) ; in this docking experiment, astronauts controlled the maneuver. After automatic docking, the two satellites continued in orbit with altitude ranging from 124-171 mi. At 7:50 am, edt, after completing 2% orbits, spacecraft were undocked on command from the ground, and placed into different orbits by restarting rocket engines. Cosmos CLXXXVI, larger of the two spacecraft, softlanded Oct. 31 after 65 orbits. Cosmos CLXXXVIII reentered Nov. 2.

•	Scientific proof that instrumented capsule irom U.S.S.R.’s Venus IV had
impacted on planet Venus Oct. 18 was presented at Moscow news conference by Mstislav Keldysh, President of Soviet Academy of Sciences. Instrumented-capsule-station’s transmitters, programmed to broadcast for 100 min, on basis of best previous estimates of pressure in atmosphere of Venus, “stopped transmitting after 94 minutes [exact time for descent]. The station recorded both its own speed and the remaining distance to the surface throughout the descent [and] also recorded the changing atmospheric pressure and recalculations on earth. . . .” Thus, based from this information and other known data, Keldysh confirmed that station stopped transmitting the instant it landed. The question of why radio transmission ended after 94 min—power for 100 min having been provided—was left unanswered.
Press conference presented additional information. Magnetic field near Venus could not exceed 1/3,000 that of earth’s; low concentration of positive ions along Venus IV’s route (much less than that at earth atmosphere’s top); absence of atomic oxygen in upper Venusian atmosphere; probable dense molecular atmosphere of Venus; large percentage of carbon dioxide (90-95%) in Venusian atmosphere; neutral hydrogen density of 1% of that near earth; nitrogen content of Venusian atmosphere measuring about 7%; and small amounts of argon and other inert gases. Water, at 1/10 to 7/10 of 1%, was reported to exist largely in the planet’s cloud layer. Weather was cloudy on Venus, without precipitation. (Shub, W Post, 10/31/67,1; Rausch, Av Wk, 11/6/67, 17)

During October: jpl Director Dr. William H. Pickering stressed importance of unmanned space exploration in Astronautics and Aeronautics: “During the past decade of space exploration, unmanned spacecraft have demonstrated a remarkable versatility in performing a wide variety of scientific tasks. The success of these robots is due largely to the ingenuity of the designers in building complex but reliable automated devices, capable of withstanding the constraints imposed by the hostile spaceflight environment.
“It is clearly evident that many difficult engineering and scientific problems remain to be solved. The experience of the past decade demonstrates, however, that within the next decade unmanned spacecraft can initiate a detailed surface exploration of our neighboring planets.
“The unmanned exploration of the solar system is technically and scientifically possible. It presents a unique opportunity to step boldly forward into new areas of both technology and science.” (Pickering, A&A, 10/67,80-4)	.
•	Congressional role in space program and possibilities for improved inter-
national cooperation in space was discussed in General Electric Forum interview by Rep. Olin E. Teague (D-Tex.), Chairman of House Committee on Science and Astronautics’ Manned Space Flight Subcommittee. Congress’ role, Rep. Teague said, was “to examine periodically how well the work is being done and what return we are gaining in new knowledge and practical utility from the space program. . . . Each decision . . . involves the setting of a relative order of priorities for the use of the Nation’s resources for science and technology.” Expressing conviction that international cooperation in space would increase, he noted that there was “great potential in the use of space for human betterment. . . . More than 60 per cent of the world’s people, for instance, are protein-deficient today. If, by earth orbital surveys, in cooperation with the less-developed countries, we can improve that situation, our entire space program will have paid for itself many times over.” (GE Forum, Autumn 1967, X/3, 11-12; CR, 10/19/67, H13719-20)

More bluntly, the NASA part of the national space program no longer has a very high priority.” He explained that “scientific and technological programs are the least understood of our national efforts. Tracing national growth and prosperity directly back to research and development is admittedly a tough job, hut I am convinced that space technology stimulates social and economic progress.” On budget levels through early 1970s, he said, -“Compared with earlier forecasts, it seems that a considerably stretched-out program will he characteristic. ...” In spite of his pessimistic outlook for the present, Rep. Karth said: “This outlook should not cause despair because the long-range prospects for progress are enormous . . .

He stated that the Government had spent $2.1 billion on basic research in FY 1967 while American industry was spending $607 million. Wooster believed that basic research and its results transcend state and national boundaries, and that there were “certain large research tools and facilities” which were too expensive for private industry, or any state or combination of states to build. As an example, he pointed to the National Magnet Laboratory at mit: “This Laboratory is a national resource already making important direct applied contributions to the defense effort.

described a capacity for revival after periods of suspended animation by insects and worm-like parasites with millions of cells. Hinton stated that these living organisms were dried out, kept in suspended animation for years, subjected to extremes of temperature, and then revived no worse for wear. According to Hinton, as long as spatial relations of the molecules were maintained, life activities could be restored to inert organisms whose cells had had no interactions for long periods of time. Injuries inflicted on fly larvae in their inert state, even cutting them into pieces, did not prevent restoration of life—although the larvae, once restored, promptly died of their wounds. Hinton suggested that if complex organisms could be reduced to an inert structure on which passage of time had no effect, infinitely prolonged “calendar” life—important for a space voyage lasting centuries or millennia—was a theoretical, although very distant, possibility.

Substantively, no big gap appeared between Soviet interpretation of its September proposal and Euratom countries’ desires, although “even after the inspection dispute is resolved, complex issues raised by India and other nuclear-capable countries, including guarantees against nuclear blackmail, will need to be resolved.” (NYT, 11/3/67, 42)
•	NASA announced that research at Ames Research Center indicated a prob-
ability of meteoroids’ puncturing spacecraft at about six times greater than previous calculations. Tests which simulated meteor entry into atmosphere were conducted in aec’s Hypervelocity Planetary Gas Tunnel. arc Director H. Julian Allen and assisting scientists Charles Shepard, Howard Stine, and Barrett Baldwin used melting or ablating tests on one stony meteorite and on samples of gabbro—common, meteor-like earth rock—at simulated speeds up to 35,000 mph. Tunnel tests showed that heat of entry into earth’s atmosphere melted rock surface, boiled off interior water, and expanded gases occurring in rock. Expansion of exterior rock layer by 10 to 1,000 times converted exterior to foam and acted as a heat shield. Foam was 2 to 20 times less dense than the unheated rock; depending on entry conditions, foam would or would not break off.
Past experience and theory had suggested that meteors were sandlike and would be remains of broken up comets; in addition, studies of meteor and comet trajectories had supported current theory that comets would be like “dirty snowballs” made mostly of ice, frozen ammonia, and methane with rock and sand additives.
Opposed to these beliefs, arc scientists speculated that many more meteors originated in the rocky asteroid belt and that much more solid rock would be contained in luminous clouds of comets, arc could now prophesy the need for greater protection on long missions where the probability of meteoroid hit would be highest.

•	Early findings from Surveyor V, launched Sept. 8 and softlanded on moon
Sept. 10, were summarized in Science by jpl scientists Leonard D. Jaffe
and Robert H. Steinbacher. The 18,006 TV pictures taken Sept. 11—24 included views of interior of crater in which Surveyor V landed, level surface surrounding crater, star and planet sightings for attitude reference, and solar-corona sequence after local sunset. Alpha-scattering instrument produced data on lunar surface chemical composition— oxygen, silicon, and aluminum identified in preliminary evaluation— and showed general chemical composition to be “similar to that of a silicate of a basaltic type.” “Material of basaltic composition at the Surveyor V landing site implies that differentiation has occurred in the moon,” which summary attributed to “internal sources of heat.” Early findings were consistent with hypothesis that “extensive volcanic flows have been responsible for flooding and filling the mare [sea] basins.” Erosion experiment, spacecraft landing effects, and other observations indicated soil had significant amounts of fine-grained material and measurable cohesion. Surveyor V had provided first direct chemical analysis of lunar surface. Lunar magnet experiment produced results, that “are most similar to a terrestrial plateau basalt with no addition of free iron.” (Science, 11/3/67, 631-52)
• Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara announced U.S.S.R.’s possible development of a Fractional Orbital Bombardment System [see Oct. 16]. While ICBm’s followed a ballistic trajectory from launch to impact and had an apogee of 800 mi, fobs, he said, was fired into a very low orbit, and before first orbit was completed, rocket engine would slow down payload and cause it to drop out of orbit—payload then following a reentry path like reentry of ICBM. He said that “we suspect [they] are pursuing the R&D of a FOBS . . . [and] it is conceivable that they could achieve an initial operational capability during 1968. Because of the low altitude of their orbits, some trajectories of a fobs would avoid detection by some early warning radars . . . [and] impact point cannot be determined until ignition of the rocket engine [deboosting payload]— roughly three minutes and 500 miles from the target. And the flight time can be as much as 10 minutes shorter than an icbm.”
Accuracy of fobs would be significantly less than that of icbm and payload a fraction of that of icbm, according to McNamara, fobs’ disadvantages had compelled dod to decide that FOBS “would not improve our strategic offensive posture . . . while development of [fobs] could be initiated at any time for relatively rapid deployment.. . .” Anticipating that early warning radars (including bmews) could not detect fobs “because of the low altitude cf [fobs] orbits,” McNamara said: “. . . already we are beginning to use operationally over-the-horizon radars which possess a greater capability of detecting fobs than does bmews. These will give us more warning time against a full-scale attack using fobs missiles than bmews gives against a heavy icbm launch.” (Text; DOD Release 1060-67)

•	CNO Adm. Thomas H. Moorer officially denied news reports on F—111B
program cancellation or drastic change: “The reports may have originated with a manufacturer’s brochure received by the Navy.” Brochure would have no “official standing,” he said. Earlier in the day ABC and Metromedia News reported usn and Congressional sources saying cancellation was official. In Fort Worth, General Dynamics Corp. President Frank W. Davis insisted the F-lll was meeting its objectives and even exceeding them in some cases.
Navy’s highest-ranking admirals had recommended cancellation of F-lllB and recasting of major features in a more economic and agile swept-wing fighter, Richard Witkin reported in New York Times. Admirals’ arguments were listed. Overweight aircraft would perform only one of its two planned missions—defense of fleet against air attack. Air-to-air and air-to-ground missions would be beyond capability of F-lllB, and admirals had been convinced that an aircraft capable of all missions could be developed and delivered to the fleet by 1973. To arrive at aircraft they wanted, admirals would scrap wings and fuselage of F-lllB; they would keep proven features, such as TF-30 engines, Phoenix air-to-air missiles, advanced radar and electronic gear—new. aircraft weighing 52,000 lbs compared with F—lllB’s 75,000 lbs and costing $4-6 million compared with $8-10 million. Navy’s limited budget could not stand the soaring costs (in the light of technical troubles delaying F—lllB’s delivery on schedule), while potential enemy’s development of better aircraft called for competitive U.S. development.
An aircraft that would keep weight down to 52,000 lbs and exploit the swept-wing and engine features of F—111B had been proposed by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp.; their promised delivery to the Navy would be less than two years behind that for F-lllB, which was three years behind schedule, Witkin reported.

November 4: NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George Mueller announced revised Apollo mission schedule of six flights in 1968 and five in 1969 using “200-series” (Uprated Saturn) and “500-series” (Saturn V) launch vehicles to test and qualify Command, Service, and Lunar Modules (c&sm and lm) . Schedule for 1968 would include: Apollo/Saturn 204 (AS-204), first unmanned test of lm in earth orbit; AS-502, second unmanned flight test of Saturn V and Apollo c&sm; AS-503, third unmanned test of Saturn V and c&sm; AS—206, second unmanned flight test of lm in earth orbit; AS-
205, first manned Apollo flight, a 10-day mission to qualify C&SM for further manned operations; AS-504, first manned Apollo flight on Saturn V, to provide experience with both c&sm and LM, including crew transfer from c&sm to LM and rendezvous and docking. Schedule for 1969 would include five manned flights (AS-505 through AS-509) with the first four programmed as lunar mission development flights or lunar mission simulations—AS—509 being that on which lunar landing would he made. Possibly the lunar landing might be delayed until one of the remaining six Saturn V flights beyond 1969.	•

November 5-6: NASA’s 805-lb Ats III (ats-c) (Applications Technology Satellite) was successfully launched from etr by Atlas-Agena D booster. Primary purpose of launch was to place spin-stabilized spacecraft into geostationary orbit, operate it for at least the first 30 days, and obtain useful data from onboard experiments. Spacecraft entered elliptical transfer orbit with 22,148-mi (35,643-km) apogee, 111-mi (179-km) perigee, 10-hr 28-min period, and 28° inclination. At 16:01:00 get (Nov. 6) apogee motor was fired to place satellite into near-synchronous orbit with 22,186-mi (35,704-km) apogee, 111-mi (179-km) perigee, 10-hr 28-min period, and 0.536° inclination, where it would be allowed to drift to stationary position over the Atlantic at 47° west longitude.
Ats III was third in series of five satellites designed to improve spacecraft technology, develop long-life control systems, advance spacecraft
communications, and improve long-range weather predictions. Five of spacecraft’s nine major experiments—Multicolor Spin-Scan Cloud Camera (sscc), Omega Position Location Experiment (ople) , Self Contained Navigation System (scns), Image Dissector Camera (idc), and Mechanically Despun Antenna—would be tested in space for first time, sscc would provide first full-disk photos of earth for continuous detailed viewing of short-lived weather phenomena. In addition, spacecraft carried VHF and shf transponders, resistojet thruster, reflectometer experi-. ment, communications equipment, and engineering experiments to evaluate spacecraft performance. Ats 1 (launched Dec. 6,1966) had exceeded its test objectives and was still operating flawlessly. Ats 11 (launched April 5,1967), though adjudged a failure, was transmitting some useful data. Ats 111 was last spacecraft to be launched from etr’s Complex 12 and last ats to be launched with Atlas-Agena; two remaining spacecraft in series would be launched with Atlas-Centaur, ats program was managed by gsfc under ossa direction, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 67-276; W Post, 11/6/67, Al)
November 6: In its resolution ^2260, U.N. General Assembly urged its Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to elaborate on “agreement on liability for damage caused by the launching of objects into outer space and an agreement on assistance to and return of astronauts and space vehicles.” On July 17, Legal Subcommittee of Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, meeting in Geneva, had reached such provisional agreement. On July 26, 1966, U.S. and U.S.S.R. had agreed ii\ principle that countries Were internationally liable for damage caused to other states by objects they launched into outer space.
Other concerns of the resolution were education and training for space exploration, feasibility of communications for direct broadcast from satellites, and applied satellite technology of benefit to man. On Jan. 18, 1966, Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space had proposed a world conference on outer space to be held in New York. This conference should examine the impact of space data on education and communications—issues of major importance even to poor and economically retarded states [see NASA SP-4007, 20], (Text; NASA SP-4007, 20, 250)

(fobs) : The weapon would “suppress our manned bombers by catching them on the ground with only a 3-minute attack warning . . . destroy the acquisition radar of any [abm] system we might install . . . [and] destroy our retaliatory ICBm’s in their silos.” Hosmer noted that Soviets call FOBS by code name Scrag, and said the May 29, 1967, issue of the American Security Council’s Washington Report contained an article “written by the exceptionally well-informed Dr. Stefan T. Possony, of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford University.” Hosmer stated: “A most vital disclosure by Possony is that the Scrag . . . would have a 30-megaton warhead, presumably sufficient to penetrate our hardened ICBM silos, ruin our ICBM missiles and thus destroy our retaliatory capacity. Despite Soviet capabilities with this size warhead and larger . . . McNamara continues to insist that Scrag warhead yields are only in the 1- to 3-megaton range. I believe he does so less with assured knowledge of the yield than he does wishfully, to support his continued claims that we do not need an ICBM system for protection because our missile silos are so strong they cannot be penetrated.” (Testimony; CR, 11/6/67, H14638-9)
•	NASA’s Apollo 4 (AS-501), which would be launched by Saturn V in
three days, had the power to place astronauts on moon, or telescopes in orbit beyond earth’s atmosphere; American capability for major strides toward the unknown had arrived when interest in these endeavors had reached a new and understandable low, Albert Sehlstedt, Jr., reported in Baltimore Sun. Along with the new era of less than major interest in space had come the high-priority problems of the Southeast Asia war and the urban riots. Aviation Week for Aug. 7 had said “An era ended for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration last week when Congress voted a $234,000,000 cut in the agency’s budget authorization for fiscal 1968.”
Many people during recent months had looked toward the achievement of social as well as scientific goals, reappraisement of both being called for by Congress. Because AS-501 would be one of the highest achievements in space, the question was no longer whether man could reach into space, but “. . . . with what urgency it should be done in the light of all the needs on earth.” (Sehlstedt, B Sun, 11/7/67, 6)

It would include $121.5 million for research and operations and $19.3 million for facilities and administration under spending plan being developed by Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (cnes). Research and operations funds would be divided, $87.8 million for French programs and $33.7 million for ELDO and ESRO projects. About $1 million also had been allocated for bilateral space research projects outside eldo and ESRO. Major items of budget included: development costs for eldo Europa l/PAS launch vehicle and Diamant B launch vehicle; R&d costs for two Roseau radio observatory satellites (scheduled for U.S.S.R. launch in 1971); planning costs for two Symphonie communications satellites (joint French-West German venture with one spacecraft structure group and two avionics groups to be chosen from competing groups in both countries); construction costs for Kourou launch complex in French Guiana; and partial costs of new Toulouse complex for satellite development and balloon sounding projects.

November 7: nasa’s Surveyor VI (Surveyor-F) was successfully launched from etr by Atlas-Centaur (AC-14) booster on 64-hr lunar intercept trajectory. Primary mission for the 2,223-lb (at launch) spacecraft was to perform a soft-landing on moon and obtain post-landing TV pictures of the lunar surface. As secondary mission spacecraft would determine relative abundance of chemical elements in lunar soil with alpha scattering instrument; obtain touchdown-dynamics, thermal, and radar-reflectivity data; and conduct vernier engine erosion experiment, nasa’s Explorer XXXIV, in orbit since May 24, would serve as a “solar watchdog,” furnishing information on solar radiation for correct interpretation of Surveyor VPs soil analyses.
At 00:04:06 get Surveyor VI with two-burn Centaur separated from Atlas and ignited to reach 100-mi-altitude circular parking orbit where it coasted for 12 min; Centaur then reignited to escape earth orbit and boost spacecraft toward moon. Spacecraft separated from Centaur, deployed its solar panels, and locked on the sun and the star Canopus. Based on a 56-mi target miss estimate, a 1.2-m midcourse maneuver was conducted at 00:18:41 get to assure precise landing on target in Sinus Medii in center of moon’s front face.
Surveyor VI was sixth in series of seven spacecraft designed to prove out design, develop technology of lunar soft-landing, obtain post-landing TV pictures of lunar surface, and provide basic scientific and engineering data in support of Project Apollo.

Robert Citron, station manager, described the operation as an “extremely accurate way of measuring distances with the use of geodetic satellites,” in a planned program extending into 1972. Debre Zeit, functioning as hub of 12 similar stations in India, Japan, Patagonia, Sj>ain, Brazil, and South Africa, measured earth’s size and shape, gravitational pull variations, and atmospheric density changes. Planned progress would include measuring shape of world “down to 33 feet,” according to Citron. He explained: “There is a widely accepted theory that the earth’s land masses are drifting. In particular, the African continent is said to be drifting away from the Asian land masses.” By using planned measuring methods with geodetic satellites, Citron hoped to explore the truth of the theory and measure the drift should the theory be true.

Mosely stated, on subject of nuclear weapons, this philosophy: “In any future period [of U.S.S.R. nuclear equality or superiority over U.S.] ... we would be prudent to assume that Soviet policy would be tempted to undertake a more extensive, more acute, and more dangerous range of risks [in pursuing] its declared long-range ambition to reshape the world according to its own dogma.”
Wolfe discussed Soviet abm program, Soviet attitude toward ABM limitation, Soviet ABM activities which relate to overall strategic posture, and political implications of a changing U.S.-Soviet military balance. He saw Soviet leadership seeking “wider options for global intervention,” and, for this goal, he looked for a buildup of defensive and offensive nuclear power and extension of the reach of their conventional military power.

November 8: NASA’s Ats III, launched Nov. 5, now in 22,300-mi-altitude synchronous orbit, transmitted to NASA’s Rosman, N.C., ground station a color photograph of earth which officials described as excellent in quality. The photograph, processed at GSFC, showed entire earth’s disk and details of features as small as two or three miles in size. Ats III, third of a series of five satellites managed by OSSA, carried communication, meteorology, navigation, and spacecraft technology experiments.
From its location over the equator at 47° west longitude, the spacecraft had a view of North and South America, part of Africa and Europe, and the southern part of Greenland icecap. Spacecraft’s multicolor spin-scan cloud camera obtained color contrast as well as brightness contrast, according to chief experimenter Wisconsin Univ.’s Dr. Verner E. Suomi. He gave this analysis of Ats Ill’s meteorological operations: “From a time series of pictures such as these the United States has, in effect, given South America a means to track their weather far beyond what they are able to do by conventional means. In one single photograph, the equatorial cloud-free band which was seen from Ats I [launched Dec. 6,1966] pictures in the Pacific is also evident in the Atlantic. These pictures are ideal for continuing studies from the heat budget and convective systems. The additional meteorological information in a color photograph is more subtle, but it is there. Low clouds tend to be bluer than high clouds. This has been possible even though adjustments to color balance on the ground are still underway. There are suggestions that the muddy outflow from the Amazon River in Brazil can be seen. We have not yet been able to determine whether or not the Gulf Stream water will be visible. Also, we do not have an example of the colors in the Terminator Zone (sunrise and sunset) to determine if cloud heights can be accurately positioned.” (nasa Release 67-286)
•	A restructuring of the Nation’s space program was outlined by NASA Ad-
ministrator James E. Webb in testimony on proposed nasa FY 1968 operating plan, before Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. Decisions had reflected fiscal, resources, and time factors. The national fiscal situation required minimum expenditures on space for the next two years. Primary emphasis on completion of Apollo program and other financially important ongoing efforts would be carried out to avoid major losses. Decisions on nasa’s space posture for the 1970s would be postponed until “fiscal year 1969 budget or later.” According to Webb’s planning, “Our allocation of resources in fiscal year 1968 must hold open for later decision the most promising future aeronautical and space options which our past large investments will support.”

Webb presented rather brief outline on present long-range planning for lunar and planetary mission hardware. Limited funds could continue development of flight-qualified engine for nerva i and would support plans for first Apollo Applications flights in 1970. Two Mars-Mariner flights for 1969 would be the “last in present program.” Five Mariner flights in 1970s, two or more Titan III launches in Voyager series in 1973, and Saturn V flight in 1975 could be considered in FY 1969 budget. Webb reasoned that NASA could “use the Atlas-Centaur . . . and the Titan III with transtage, to move out into further planetary operations but with very limited expenditures in 1968 and 1969.”
Responding to questions by Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Webb referred to recent CSC decision on NASA personnel contracts and said he would join with CSC chairman and the Comptroller General in working out pattern for support contracts, the KSC contract providing his guidelines.

November 9: NASA’s Apollo 4 (AS-501) was successfully launched from etr at 7:00 am EST in first all-up test of three-stage Saturn V launch vehicle, first in-orbit restart of third (S-IVB) stage, and first use of Launch Complex 39 and ground support equipment. Launch vehicle stages performed nominally; orbital insertion, 3rd stage restart, and injection into earth-intersecting coast ellipse were accomplished satisfactorily; Command Module (cm) encountered no functional problems; and splashdown occurred within 10 mi of planned landing point. Third stage ignited to insert Command Service Module (csm) into orbit with nominal parking apogee, 119 mi; perigee, 114 mi; period, 88.2 min; inclination, 32.6°. After two revolutions in parking orbit, 3rd stage was reignited for simulated translunar injection burn, injected stage and spacecraft into earth intersecting orbit with 10,774-mi apogee. Following stage/cSM separation, Service Propulsion System (sps) ignited for 16-sec burn, raising apogee to 11,314 mi. Spacecraft was aligned to a specific attitude to achieve thermal gradient across cm heat shield. Attitude, with cm hatch window directly toward sun, was maintained for about 41/2 hrs. [cm hatch window had been replaced with instrumented test panel containing simulations of flexible thermal seals and gaps between hatch and surrounding heat shield. Successful performance of thermal seals during reentry heating would qualify seals for use on manned cms,] SPS was then reignited for 271-sec bum to accelerate spacecraft to the most severe entry conditions that could possibly occur in a lunar-return trajectory, sps cutoff was followed by cm/sm separation and orientation of CM to entry attitude. Atmosphere reentry at 400,000 ft occurred at flight path angle of — 7.077° with inertial velocity of 36,537 fps (24,911 mph). cm landed in mid-Pacific near Hawaii at 3:37 pm, est, and was recovered by uss Bennington 2 hrs 14 min after touchdown.
In significant step toward developing manned lunar landing capability, Apollo 4’s flight was the first of two to three missions designed to qualify Saturn V for manned flight, and the first test of the structural integrity and compatibility of launch vehicle and spacecraft. By subjecting cm’s heat shield to high heat load and heat rate, NASA was evaluating cm’s design adequacy for reentry from lunar missions—primary objective to achieve successful manned lunar mission. Other primary mission objectives were to: confirm launch loads and dynamic characteristics; demonstrate stage separation; verify operation of launch vehicle subsystems and spacecraft subsystems; evaluate performance of space vehicle Emer-

Saturn V was the most powerful space vehicle developed in U.S. space program; in launch configuration with Apollo 4, height was 363 ft, and weight, fully fueled, was 6,220,025 lbs. Saturn V’s 1st stage engines produced 7,610,000 lbs of thrust at liftoff, and the launch vehicle placed 278,699 lbs in earth orbit. This launch vehicle could place 96,000 lbs on the moon. Kerosene (RP-1) was the fuel used in the five 1st stage (S—1C) engines, while 2nd stage (S-II) engines used liquid hydrogen. The five S-II stage J-2 engines, developing total thrust of 1,000,000 lbs, were rated for operations to 117-mi altitude and to 935-mi distance down-range. Third stage (S-IVB) J-2 engine, using liquid hydrogen fuel, developed about 200,000 lbs of thrust.
High-quality pictures of the earth were obtained from about one hour before to one hour after apogee on Command Module apogee camera film processed at MSC.
Success for Apollo 4 (AS-501), according to NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dr. George E. Mueller, had been achieved in terms of “pre-set primary objectives.” Heat shield design, S-IVB restart, structural/thermal integrity, compatibility of launch vehicle and spacecraft, and ground support had been proven.
Direction of Apollo Program had been the responsibility of OMSF; development of Apollo spacecraft, flight crew training, and mission control the responsibility of msc ; development of Saturn launch vehicles the responsibility of MSFC; and Apollo/Saturn launch operations the responsibility of KSC. Under overall direction of OTDA, msfn had been managed by gsfc. (NASA Proj Off; NASA Release 67-275; msfc Release 67-226)

November 9-24: NASA’s Surveyor VI, launched Nov. 7, became fourth U.S. spacecraft to sofdand on the moon when it touched down at 08:01 EST
in Sinus Medii after 64-hr flight and began transmitting first of 30,065 detailed television pictures to JPL Deep Space Facilities, Goldstone, Calif.
Landing sequence began when Surveyor VI shifted its normal cruising attitude to position main retrorocket. Triggered by radar, main retro-motor slowed spacecraft to 374 mph; retromotor then ejected. Vernier engines cut off at 13 ft above lunar surface and spacecraft landed.
First photos transmitted showed one of spacecraft’s landing pads resting on sand-like soil similar to that pictured in previous Surveyor photos. Later pictures confirmed that area was rough and pitted with craters; they revealed a region strewn with rocks up to two feet in diameter and a huge cliff described by usgs scientist Dr. Eugene Shoemaker as “the most rugged feature . . . yet seen on the moon.” Efforts to reestablish communications with Surveyor V, which had softlanded Sept. 10, for simultaneous communications with Surveyor VI, proved futile.
On Nov. 17 Surveyor Vi’s vernier engines were fired for 2.5 sec, lifting spacecraft to 10-ft altitude before it touched down 8.5 sec later, 8 ft west of original resting point. Purpose of translation—first planned change of location ever accomplished after conclusion of initial flight—was to test lunar surface bearing strength, determine depth of original footprints made by spacecraft, obtain stero-type effect by comparing photos taken of same area from different positions, and study engine erosion effects. Post-translation photos showed cratering and scouring effect on areas under engines and confirmed that alpha-scattering instrument— which had stopped functioning properly after operating successfully for 43 hrs and providing excellent data on chemical composition of lunar soil—had come to rest upside down. Communications with spacecraft were halted Nov. 24 to preserve battery power during cold of lunar night.
Performance of Surveyor VI was nearly flatvless. Surveyor I (launched May 30,1966), Surveyor III (launched April 17, 1967), and Surveyor V (launched Sept. 8, 1967) had all softlanded successfully and transmitted photos to earth. Surveyor II (launched Sept. 20, 1966) failed to soft-land because of an ignition failure. Communications with Surveyor IV (launched July 14, 1967) were lost seconds before it was scheduled to softland and its condition could not be determined, (nasa Proj Off; NASA Release 67—278; JPL Release; AP, B Sun, 11/10/67, 1; Reuters, W Post, 11/10/67, 1)
November 10: nasa successfully launched Essa VI (tos-d), sixth meteorological satellite in essa’s Tiros Operational Satellite (tos) system, from Wtr using three-stage Thrust-Augmented Thor-Delta booster. Primary mission objective was to provide global cloud coverage on a regular, daily basis with six-month-nominal and three-month-minimum spacecraft lifetime. Satellite achieved near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit with 920-mi (1,482-km) apogee, 872-mi (1,402-km) perigee, 114.8-min period, and 102.1° inclination. Wheel orientation maneuver was scheduled for completion during 18th orbit at which time first photos would be programmed and NASA would check out spacecraft before turning its operation over to essa.
An advanced version of the cartwheel configuration, 286-lb Essa VI carried two Automatic Picture Transmission (apt) camera systems modified with improved magnetic shielding to prevent slight banding visible in previous essa apt photos. Cameras would photograph earth’s
cloud cover and immediately transmit pictures to local apt stations. Essa VI would supplement Essa II and Essa IV, replacing them when they became inoperable.
essa financed, managed, and operated tos system; gsfc was responsible for procurement, launch, and initial checkout of spacecraft in orbit. Essa I was launched Feb. 3, 1966; Essa II, Feb. 28, 1966; Essa III, Oct. 2, 1966; Essa IV, Jan. 26, 1967; and Essa V, April 20, 1967.

November 14: Rep. George P. Miller (D-Calif.), Chairman, House Committee on Science and Astronautics, spoke to National Space Club in Washington: “Impressive as our launch vehicles, spacecraft, and scientific instrumentation may be, I have always viewed the space program principally as an investment in people, not hardware.” He said principal contribution of the national space effort had been “its stimulation of young people’s interest in education [and] much of the credit for the revitalization of American education in recent years must be given to the space program.” Scientists and engineers were challenged in keeping up with new knowledge. Universities were made active partners of industry and Government through sustaining university and training grants and laboratory construction, funded by NASA.
Because of current fiscal situation the NASA educational support had been drastically reduced, Rep. Miller noted, and probably would remain at a lower level for some time. Universities had to look to private sources for support previously supplied by Federal Government.

November 15: NASA X—15 (No. 3) crashed in Mojave Desert when the aircraft “exceeded its structural limitations during the final portions of the reentry maneuver,” X—15 Accident Investigating Board suspected. X— 15’s pilot, Maj. Michael J. Adams, did not use ejection system and was killed, the first fatality in the 191 flights since the three X—15s started their flight operations, June 8, 1959. Usual flight plan called for aircraft to ascend at a sharp angle after being dropped by B—52 aircraft. After engine burnout, plan called for coasting up into high thin air, then dropping back in pancake style into thicker air for reentry. According to a NASA spokesman, the aircraft had risen to about 260,000 ft and encountered trouble on the way down. “There apparently was some sort of control malfunction as the pilot attempted to pull out of his descent,” spokesman said. Radar and telemetry data received during flight were excellent, data being received down to an altitude of 60,000 ft.
Speed and altitude records for winged aircraft—4,534 mph, by Maj. William J. Knight (usaf), and 354,200 ft, by nasa’s Joseph A. Walker (who had since died in crash of XB-70 No. 2 and F—104 aircraft) — had been set by X—15s. Two crash landings of X—15 aircraft had occurred; pilots had survived and aircraft had been restored to flight status. X-15 No. 3 pilot, Maj. Adams, 37, had finished usaf training in 1952, flown in combat in Korea, and graduated with honors from Aerospace Research Pilots School. Although assigned to mol program, he had requested transfer to X-15 operations.

•	NASA Administrator James E. Webb, at Chicago meeting of American
Petroleum Institute, spoke on space program’s technological and social benefits in assessing developing capabilities which would “serve our nation’s future needs.” He called attention to “special equipment that will automatically monitor ground, underseas cable, or satellite circuits carrying high-speed traffic [and] the entire international communications network structure of the world . . . more valuable today than it was just a few years ago.” He also pointed out that “the rocket technology that carried Surveyor to the moon provided astronomers with an improvement in resolution beyond that provided by Ranger by another factor of 1000. That is 1000 times more detail than the Ranger results which themselves were 1000 times better than anything before.”
Webb said the U.S.S.R. was “building a rocket bigger than Saturn V, I feel sure.” He explained that the Saturn V-Apollo system “permits us to operate out as far as the moon with large payloads of about 100,000 pounds.” He compared U.S.S.R. and U.S. exploration of the planet
Venus: “The Russians sent a capsule weighing 845 pounds into the atmosphere of Venus and we made a close fly-by. But in many ways the Mariner [U.S.] data are more complete. It reaches down to about 6 miles from the surface of Venus, while the Venus 4 [U.S.S.R.] data appear to have stopped at about 15 miles up.”
Webb explained how NASA’s system for making the most of the Nation’s technological capabilities uses “a Government-industry-university research base and provides a direct channel for industry to apply new knowledge to industry problems.” He referred to work on campuses of 200 universities: “. . . the number of scientists, engineers, researchers, technicians and graduate students participating in NASA activity has grown to about 10,000. Of these, about 1000 are involved as scientific or engineering investigators.” Webb concluded that “at any foreseeable budget level NASA will maintain the base of knowledge that will determine the ability of this country to plan, undertake and accomplish successfully new and difficult aeronautical and space objectives.” (Text)
•	In testimony before House Committee on Interstate Commerce’s Trans-
portation and Aeronautics Subcommittee, Rep. John W. Wydler (R-N.Y.), member of House Committee on Science and Astronautics, urged passage of H.R. 3400 to allow Secretary of Transportation to prescribe aircraft noise abatement regulations. Rep. Wydler cited complaints from churches whose religious services had been interrupted; doctors whose patients’ mental and physical health had been impaired; schools whose classes had been disrupted; and individuals whose lives had been inhumanly intruded upon by jet aircraft noise. Passage of the bill was imperative, he said, because aircraft noise had become “something that dominates the lives of those who have to live with it to the point where it actually destroys the way in which they are living.”
Secretary of Transportation Alan S. Boyd told Subcommittee that dot was trying to find a solution to the problem, but he admitted his disbelief that “there will ever be such a thing as a quiet airplane. Despite our far longer experience with the problems of truck noise and railroad noise, we have not been able to produce quiet vehicles in those modes of transportation.” However, he believed that “we will be able, by technological and regulatory means, to reduce the impact of aircraft noise exposure for the majority of Americans who are . . . subject to excessive noise exposure.” He said bill was “the mechanism by which we can assure future aircraft are substantially quieter than our present generation [of aircraft].” (Transcript)

•	Predicting future trends in aeronautics and space, nasa’s Assistant Associ-
ate Administrator for Advanced Research and Technology John L. Sloop told American Society for Metals in Rochester, Pa.: “Current events make it clear that many national needs are increasing the pressure on resources and this is being felt over a wide range of activities. . . . It is times like these, however, that give the opportunity for advanced research and technology to open up the range of possible new missions that can be considered in future national decisions [and] we must visualize future mission possibilities and develop the various technologies needed at an optimum pace. Essential to the soundness of this approach is emphasis on technology that has multiple applications.”
Sloop praised “the potential of applications satellites,” and said it was “perhaps best gaged by the number of users, domestic and foreign, that are willing to invest their own money. In communications, there are over a dozen proposals for systems that involve an estimated investment of over a billion dollars.” (Text)

•	Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.), Chairman of House Committee on Science
and Astronautics’ Manned Space Flight Subcommittee, on floor of House praised NASA’s Surveyor program: “It successfully demonstrated the technique of soft-landing [and] . . . with the successfully concluded Lunar Orbiter program, it found and certified manned landing sites....” He said the program had supplied scientists with the first real information on the chemical composition of the lunar surface. In the eastern Sea of Tranquility, for example, Surveyor V determined that the surface was made up of the same elements common to the surface of the earth; namely, oxygen, silicon, and aluminum. He concluded:
“Since both Surveyor and its Centaur booster encountered enormous problems in the early stages of development, the eventual success of the program demonstrated the skill, perseverance, and determination of the NASA-industry-university team.” (CR, 11/20/67, H15619)

•	The U.S. should expect “an early Soviet attempt to send a large payload
around the moon and recover it on earth,” Rep. George P. Miller (D-Calif.), Chairman, House Committee on Science and Astronautics, said in releasing committee report: “Review of Soviet Space Program,” prepared by Dr. Charles S. Sheldon II, Chief of Library of Congress’ Science Policy Research Div. This 1957-67 review drew comparisons with the corresponding program in U.S. Rep. Miller commented: “At the same time that space efforts in the United States appear to be slackening, the pace of Soviet space flight has picked up by about 60 percent this year over the corresponding ten months total of last year. The strong technological base the Russians are building through a sustained, longterm commitment to space [assures them] sophisticated and intricate planetary probes . . . unmanned or manned space platforms . . . [application of] aerospace technology systems management to a great variety of industrial and social purposes here on earth.”
Committee report gave “no simple, direct answer” on “whether there is a space race” but suggested “at the present time both the Soviet Union and the United States have put large resources of somewhat similar size into very broadly based programs of great strength.”
Competition in overall space capability, especially on weight lifting and thrust of launch vehicles used by U.S. and U.S.S.R., was illustrated: “In connection with the nasa Administrator’s August 1967 pronouncement on the expected large Soviet vehicle [Saturn V class], he made a plea for support of an American nuclear stage to mount on Saturn V in order to leapfrog the Russians. A month later, Leonid Sedov in Moscow stated his belief in the importance of nuclear propulsion for the very large rockets which will soon be needed.” (Text; nasa SP-4007, 212; Committee Release, 11/20/67)
•	In the last decade, the Nation acquired vast new knowledge, wrote nasa
Administrator James E. Webb in Aerospace Technology’s Seventh An-

It is essential that we delay no longer in sorting out that which is valid and enduring, in terms of your total interest and mine, from that which is superficial or transitory.” (Text)
November 20—21: Since X—15 No. 3 crash Nov. 15, research missions in X-15 No. 1 and No. 2 had been suspended by FRC until review of flight operating procedures was completed. X—15 No. 1 was awaiting captive flight checkout under wing of B-52 carrier plane. X-15 No. 2 was under repair at North American Rockwell plant following damage to lower stub fin on its tail, but was expected to be flying by February 1968.
Cause of X-15 No. 3 crash was unknown. The pilot, Maj. Michael J. Adams, had difficulty with control booster system; X—15 failed to recover from a dive from extremely high altitude, the pilot losing control above
200,000	ft and regaining it briefly at about 80,000 ft.

•	NASA FY 1968 operating plan was presented by Administrator James E.
Webb to House Committee on Science and Astronautics, reflecting accommodation of fund reductions by Congress during recent months— 20% for r&d programs other than Apollo, 50% for construction of facilities, and 7% for administrative operations. He reviewed decisions restructuring NASA effort at least through FY 1969.
The first scheduled Apollo Applications flights of 1970—a “limited number with limited objectives”—would begin with a “precursor training mission for scientists-astronauts with certain orbital experiments, and then proceed with dual launch missions with the Orbited Workshop and the Apollo Telescope Mount.” Launch vehicle/spacecraft
hardware for follow.-on Apollo Applications flights would depend on funding “some time after FY 1969,” because of stringent FY 1969 budgetary guidelines.
Future planning for Uprated Saturn—acknowledging necessity for production termination after vehicle No; 216—included FY 1968-funded lead time items “to hold open the option of continued production ... at the rate of two per year.” Webb explained that he held open the option of definite termination of Uprated Saturn production, intending to “preserve competition among the companies involved and between solid, liquid, and, where applicable, nuclear propulsion systems.” To preserve competition would cost 83.5 million from FY 1968 funds. He announced NASA—dod discussions “to consider carefully future national requirements for large launch vehicles, including a possible new booster of the 100,000-pound in earth orbit class.”
Webb stressed the need for planetary exploration utilizing both orbiters and landers in a long-term program: “We do not believe that it is the policy of the Nation or the intent of Congress that the United States abandon the field of planetary exploration.” Present program still had two Mars-Mariner 1969 flights; continuity depended on NASA’s current 8143.4-million allocation to lunar and planetary category which would serve as basis for reestablishing future programs in FY 1969 budget.
Development of nerva I flight-qualified engine could proceed “with the amounts that we and the aec have available in FY 1968,” longer-range planning again dependent on “an affirmative decision” in the Administration’s FY 1969 budget for NASA. (Text)

November 22: NASA reported its space engineers at jpl’s Space Flight Operations Facility, using Goldstone dsn station, had sent commands to check
Mariner IV’s camera and data storage system; spacecraft, launched Nov. 28, 1964, had now traveled about 1.5 billion miles and was circling sun between earth and Mars. Mariner IV had been commanded to take TV pictures of black space and record on magnetic tape after long space environment exposure. The spacecraft had responded perfectly. Commands also were sent to switch Mariner V’s transmitter from high gain directional to low gain omnidirectional antenna, mission of spacecraft being terminated; Mariner V, launched June 14, had completed its Venus mission and was in solar orbit between orbits of Venus and Mercury, about 74 million miles from earth and about 60 million miles from sun. NASA reported that it might be possible to recontact Mariner V in Sept. 1968, when spacecraft’s antennas would be pointed once again toward earth.
Both Mariners would remain in solar orbit indefinitely; however, 'because Mariner IV’s stabilizing nitrogen gas supply was expected to run out in the next few weeks, spacecraft would drift and solar panels would no longer face the sun.

November 26: U.S.S.R.’s long-held superiority in large boosters had given it an advantage over U.S. in nuclear warhead protection, according to Pentagon sources. The advantage would become significant both offensively and defensively because of present developments in abm defenses—developments designed to destroy incoming warheads in outer space with intensive x-ray emissions. Soviet scientists could easily add more shielding to their warheads to halt x-ray bombardments from U.S. antimissile missiles, article noted, but U.S. was handicapped by weight limitations of its lower-thrust boosters. “Some officials,” article said, “are concerned that the hardness of Russian warheads will lessen seriously the protective capability of the Pentagon’s planned [abm systems] . . . [and] that U.S. offensive missiles now need more protection ... to survive Russian anti-missile explosions and reach their targets.”
U.S. answer might lie in new lightweight composite materials under development; made by winding and inorganically bonding filaments of such materials as carbon, silica, and graphite, they would strengthen heat shield at little penalty in weight. (B Sun, 11/21/61, Al) November 27: In apparent sharp increase in testing, U.S.S.R. would launch fourth 1967 test series of “carrier rockets” into the Pacific between Nov. 28 and Dec. 30, according to Tass announcement.

November 27—29: American Astronautical Society’s Astronautics International Conference was held in New York City.
Coupling a plea for constructive realism with a denunciation of U.S.S.R.’s mere lip service toward international space cooperation, NASA Assistant Administrator for International Affairs Arnold W. Frutkin discussed ways for understanding “international space cooperation.” No Russian attended the conference, two speakers and one cosmonaut declined invitations. Frutkin explained that cooperation meant “joint projects, jointly undertaken, jointly carried out, and jointly profitable.” Realistic projects practicing space cooperation on an international scale were cited by Frutkin to be: nasa’s program; esro/eldo complex for combining “ten European nations in spacecraft development and seven nations in large vehicle development;” and Intelsat satellite telecommunications consortium, including “some sixty nations in day-to-day operational space communications traffic.”
He included in U.S. benefits from the NASA cooperative program “gold flow [for] foreign purchase of space hardware and services,” Canadian ionospheric investigations, West German barium cloud technique, Italian atmospheric density measurements, and French global wind circulation studies.
Frutkin referred to esro’s program as “a true pooling of resources [which] goes well beyond the NASA cooperative program. In esro, “common facilities have been planned, financed and operated on an international basis by an international governmental agency.”
MSC Director Dr. Robert R. Gilruth discussed manned space flight “from Mercury to Apollo.” He said Mercury defined man’s survivability in space, Gemini defined man’s operational capability, and Apollo would be first in utilizing space for manned exploration. “To progress in ten
short years from exploring survivability to utilization on the most difficult exploration mission ever undertaken implies a rate of change in technical capability which has no real parallel in history,” he said. Deep space and lunar operations would be faced as “two new major dimensions to our space capabilities.” Space explorers would be coping with the need for huge amounts of energy, extremely precise navigation to hit target and reentry corridor, and radiation protection that could include the intensities generated by solar flares. Lunar explorers would require a vehicle designed to operate entirely outside earth’s atmosphere, descend to and ascend from lunar surface, and propel reliably while exhibiting “relative sophistication of a throttleable engine.”
Man returning from first lunar exploration trip would have accomplished “an age-old dream [of visiting] his nearest neighbor in space [and found] a key to the riddle of Earth’s relation to its nearest neighbor [and] a chance of understanding the creative forces that formed his own home—Earth.” “For the first time he will have soared beyond the confines of Earth’s gravity and felt the pull of a foreign planet [and] personally viewed our whole planet as a small bluish ball only four times the span of the lunar disk. These experiences may well produce profound changes in man’s attitude towards himself and his world comparable to those wrought by Galileo’s dramatic demonstration of the Copemican theory, changes which should tend to inspire man to place the affairs of his very small house in order.” (Text)
NASA’s Apollo Applications Program (aap) Director Charles W.

November 28: sst design refinements reflecting 1966 recommendations made by 240-man Government and airline evaluation team were announced by Boeing Co. Vice President H. W. Withington. Prototype refinements were still to be reviewed by FAA and described in detail to the 26 airlines which had reserved sst deliveries. Changes included addition of canard surfaces, incorporation of direct-lift control, -lengthening fuselage by 12 ft, and provision of more convenience in passenger boarding and deplaning. Withington cited progress in component and subsystem testing and in wind-tunnel investigations. The first metal (titanium alloy billets) for airliner prototypes was under production. Major contractors were preparing for work on assemblies and Boeing was making ready facilities for construction of the two prototypes.

Norris Cotton (R-N.H.), ranking minority member of Senate Committee on Commerce, and S. Res. 172 and 186, introduced by Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), member of Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. He cited primary concern and interest of DOD to be U.S. use of the “ocean environment for purposes of maintaining or enhancing our national security.”
Pointing out deep ocean exploitation involved “unsettled areas” of international law—one area being “the appropriate breadth of the continental shelf”-—Wamke cited the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf and noted that congressional policy “in this field is manifested in the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act of 1966.”
He stated that DOD supported the need for comprehensive studies on ocean exploration and exploitation reflected in Senate Joint Resolution 111. On security grounds, he specifically objected to Section IV of S. Res. 186 on “use of seabed and subsoil of ocean space for peaceful purposes only” until thorough studies could be completed leading to “a sound judgment consistent with security” of U.S. Further objection was voiced by Warnke on a “sea guard” which S. Res. 186 called for; his argument cited “the difficult political and military problems inherent in the organizing of international peacekeeping or enforcement agencies or forces.” (Testimony)

November 30: Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), Chairman, Senate Committee on Armed Services’ Nuclear Safeguards Subcommittee, reported from Senate floor that “Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty safeguards [were] being supported and implemented in a satisfactory manner.” He said that recent Soviet and Chinese missile and nuclear developments had formed “serious challenge to the strategic superiority of U.S. power on which our defense planners have counted to maintain political stability and to keep the peace.” Sen. Jackson listed two prime requirements to maintain U.S. strategic superiority. First would be strategic offensive capability to penetrate Soviet abm defenses using new generations of land-based icbms and nuclear submarines with better missiles and using MIRVs. Second requirement would be the best ABM defense to protect U.S. retaliatory second-strike force, to safeguard American people, and to account for allies’ needs. He cited seriousness of Soviet’s doubling icbms, developing orbital nuclear bombs, and deploying abm system around Moscow, especially when combined with growing Communist Chinese nuclear threat.

•	DOD was studying contract performance under its letter contract with
Pratt & Whitney for F-lll engines. Orr Kelly, reporting in Washington Star, stated, “The Defense Dept, has ordered a high-level investigation of [Pratt & Whitney operations] in an effort to cut [F-lll engine costs], Pentagon sources said today.” A firm price had not been set—final contract negotiations would begin in early 1968—but negotiation and factfinding teams, headed by Asst. Secretary of Navy for Installations and Logistics Graeme C. Bannerman, Chief of Naval Material Adm. I. J. Galantin, and Procurement Control and Clearance Div. Chief Gordon W. Rule would continue to work for final contract containing “target costs, profits and prices to the government.” Rising costs were reflected in history of F—111 engine procurement: 1961 cost estimate, $270,000;
1965	Pratt & Whitney ceiling price for British government, $400,000;
1966	Pratt & Whitney letter contract estimates to U.S. Government, $700,000 to $750,000. Article stated that negotiations on price of engine were “not related to the quality;” further, negotiations would not delay aircraft’s development, according to a Navy official, dod sources emphasized price differences could not be taken “as a full measure of the rise in price because there have been significant improvements in the engine, giving it greater thrust, since 1961.” After letter contract was signed, Naval Air Systems Command had asked the Performance Technology Corp. to make an independent investigation of Pratt & Whitney operations. At issue were 2,053 TF-30 engines manufactured in four-year period 1967-1970. (Kelly, W Star, 11/30/67, 1)

December 2: 25th anniversary of first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear reaction, achieved by the late Enrico Fermi at Univ. of Chicago in 1942.
At two-day meeting at Univ. of Chicago sponsored by aec and the International Atomic Energy Agency, AEC Chairman Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg said U.S. nuclear plants currently generated 2.8 million kw of electrical power. By 1980, he said, figure would reach 150 million kw and by 2000,700 million kw.
President Johnson, stressing significance of the anniversary, said: “Throughout history, man has struggled to find enough power—enough energy—to do his work in the world. He domesticated animals, he sold his brother into slavery, and enslaved himself to the machine—all in the desperate search for energy. ... By learning the secret of the atom, we have given mankind, for the first time in history, all the energy he can possibly use.” Urging acceptance of a nonproliferation treaty, he noted that countries with a single reactor, while generating electricity, could produce enough plutonium to make dozens of bombs every year. Even if their purpose were peaceful, he said, “the fact remains that the secret diversion of even a small part of the plutonium they create could soon give every nation power to destroy civilization. . . .” To prove U.S. desire to halt spread of nuclear weapons he announced that “when such safeguards are applied under the treaty, the [U.S.] will permit the International Atomic Energy Agency to apply its safeguards to all nuclear activities in the [U.S.]—excluding only those with direct national significance.” (Sullivan, NYT, 12/3/67, 1; PD, 12/11/67, 1650-1)

•	Moscow Aviation Institute professor Feliks Zigel had called for a “joint
effort of all the scientists of the world,” to determine the nature of unidentified flying objects (ufos), according to Soviet press agency Novosti. Group of which he was a member had had 200 reports of sightings, Zigel said. Typical of these was “a luminous orange-colored crescent flying with its outward bend forward. Its surface is only a little duller than that of the moon. The horns of the crescent throw out jets, sometimes with sparks. The outer contour of the crescent is sharp and the inner contour blurred and wavy.” The main task, Zigel asserted, was to organize a systematic study of the phenomena from astronomical and meteorological observatories to determine whether the objects were of protoplasmic or extraterrestrial origin. “Unfortunately, certain scientists both in . . . [U.S.S.R. and U.S.] deny the very existence of the
problem instead of helping to solve it. . . . The U.F.o. phenomenon is a challenge to mankind. It is the duty of scientists to take up this challenge, to disclose the nature of the u.F.O. and to establish the scientific truth.” (Kamm, NYT, 12/10/67, 70)

•	“Evaluation of Apollo 4 mission data . . . continues to confirm initial
reports that Spacecraft 017 met all flight objectives without problems,” NASA announced. Detailed systems analyses were still in process, but evidence to date indicated spacecraft systems operated properly during Nov. 9 mission and met all specifications.
First Service Propulsion System (sps) burn had occurred as scheduled; second sps burn, however, was 13 sec longer than planned, because of a switchover to ground control after burn was started by onboard guidance and navigation system. Although review of the burn was still being conducted, NASA had already determined that there had been no failure in onboard systems involved. Because of the longer-than-planned SPS burn, spacecraft’s reentry velocity was 0.0058% higher than expected; actual velocity was 24,913 mph, compared with nominal 24,772 mph. Increased velocity caused higher Command Module (cm) maximum heat rate—620 BTUs per sq ft per sec instead of planned 586 BTUs. Maximum rate expected on' lunar return was 480 btus. Maximum g on reentry was 7.3, compared with expected 8.33 g, because of a shallower reentry flight-path angle.
Cabin pressure remained between 5.6 and 5.8 psi during entire mission, indicating negligible leakage rate. Cabin air temperature remained stable at 60° F during orbit and increased to 70° F during reentry. Structural performance of the spacecraft and Lunar Test Article 10-R (a simulated lunar module) during launch and boost phase was satisfactory. Earth landing system functioned as planned; all parachutes inflated properly, and recovery aids deployed and operated normally. Heat shield performance was good; maximum char thickness was 34 in, and charring of crew compartment heat shield was less than expected. Fuel cell and cryogenic subsystems functioned normally, with fuel cells producing potable sterile water and demonstrating excellent load-sharing and thermal-control capability. CM and sm reaction-control systems, electrical power subsystem, and spacecraft sequential devices operated normally, with all functions occurring at scheduled times.
Guidance and control system and the mission control programmer performed properly. Range-to-go at drogue parachute deployment calculated was 2.2 nm. Comparisons with measured landing point indicated better than predicted performance. All communications objectives were accomplished. Each MSFN station, Apollo tracking ship Vanguard, and at least two of the Apollo/Range Instrumentation Aircraft established two-way communications with the spacecraft as planned.

•	Thomas O’Toole, writing in the Washington Post, reviewed nasa’s “grow-
ing role in the Vietnam war.” Both NASA and dod were reluctant to disclose the size of NASA’s defense effort, he charged, “but it’s known that [oart] is spending between $4 million and $5 million a year directing the efforts of 100 scientists and engineers to tasks vital to the Vietnam war.” Results of NASA research, he said, included a new acoustic detector able to locate mortars by measuring ground vibrations, a more-steerable parachute, aircraft engines too quiet to be heard during approach, a scissors-like sling for helicopter rescues, and a helicopter which did not make a chopper noise. Although NASA willingly participated in defense research, its authorization to do so was “fuzzy,” he said, based only on a section of the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act which directed NASA to make available to defense organizations “discoveries that have military value or significance.” NASA was “nervous” about its military role, he asserted, because of its unclear authorization, fear of congressional inquiry, and fear of international reaction.
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) later attacked O’Toole’s article on the Senate floor: “One might expect that if ... a story of this sort were to be dug up, the article would express gratification that the taxpayer’s money was being used on behalf of the American people . . . [and not purport to be] shocked that NASA projects help our national objective. ... I am firmly of the conviction that anything that can be developed technically to save a single American life in Vietnam, especially by any individual or organization that is being paid by American taxpayers, belongs freely to our soldiers. . . .
“The article is obviously a patently calculated leak. The informed details it provides on NASA’s research and technical work proves this. . . . This is a shocking thing, that is not a matter of press freedom, or even of press license, but plain aid and comfort to the enemy. . . . Publishers and editors should accept their responsibility to prevent such . . . news coverage and to prevent, too, the violation of security classifications on subjects that involve adversely the preservation of the lives of American fighting men.” (O’Toole, W Post, 12/4/67, Al ; NASA lar VI/128)

•	Michael Getler, in Aerospace Technology editorial, cited U.K.’s lack of
“willingness to invest at home in the pursuit of new technology needed to compete and to grow,” as a maj or reason for devaluation of the British pound [see Nov. 18]. Comparing French and U.K. economies Getler noted that France had invested heavily in her own industry to support a large-scale military buildup and an expensive national space program. “In contrast to French willingness to pay for the cost of [r&d], the British have tended to treat their big companies solely as manufacturers. . . .
“While the British have purchased [U.S.] Polaris missiles ... the French have built their own. The British . . . now are buying U.S.-built F-4s and F-llls, while the French continue to design and build newer versions of their own Mirage family, and are now exporting them. . . .
“The British national space program is virtually non-existent despite a growing realization . . . [by] Parliament that investment in a properly scaled effort can be of great importance in developing [British] technology. . . . There is no suggestion that the British take on a multibillion dollar effort, but there certainly are grounds to support investment in a $100 million program . . . that would be directed at developing satellites with some obvious commercial applications.”
Although U.K.’s purchases of U.S. goods were “good business for American industry,” Getler noted, “the long range risk to this country is that an old and comparably faithful ally will be weakened in the process. Eventually, the British will tire of buying U.S. weapons . . . [but will have] no R&D base ... to fall back. . . .” (Getler, Aero Tech, 12/4/67,58)

December 11: nasa Deputy Administrator Dr. Robert C. Seamans, Jr., testifying before the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries’ Subcommittee on Oceanography, summarized nasa’s activities in national marine science program. NASA’s activities, primarily exploratory, were aimed at ascertaining what potential benefits could be gained in oceanography through the application of space techniques and equipment, he said. Major areas included: (1) investigation of the applicability of existing space technology to problems of oceanography; (2) studies of remote sensing of oceanographic phenomena, including analysis of data obtainable from space missions not originally conceived for oceanographic purposes such as Gemini, Tiros, and Nimbus photos; and (3) development and test of remote sensors for viewing and discrimination of oceanographic phenomena.
Spacecraft, Dr. Seamans said, “will not supplant surface, subsurface, and airborne research and monitoring systems; rather they will supplement them. The absolute accuracy, three-dimensional capability, and selective resolution of these conventional systems will continue to be necessary and must be utilized as a part of the overall system to their best advantage. However, Earth-orbiting spacecraft have unique advantages for obtaining certain types of marine data as follows: repetitive worldwide coverage, greater frequency of observation (once or twice daily for polar orbiting satellites and continuous lor geostationary satellites),
ability to observe remote areas at will, and an ‘all-weather’ capability for certain parameters.” (Testimony; SBD, 12/20/67,257)

December 13: NASA’s Pioneer VIII (Pioneer C), third in series of five spacecraft designed to provide continuing measurements over the solar cycle at widely separated points in interplanetary space, was successfully launched from etr by Thrust-Augmented Thor-Delta booster into orbit around the sun. Orbital parameters: aphelion, 1.0080 astronomical units (au) or 101.2 million mi (162.8 million km); perihelion, 0.9892 au or 91.5 million mi (147.2 million km) ; period, 386.6 days; and inclination, 0.057°. Primary mission objective of the 145-lb, drum-shaped satellite was to collect scientific data on interplanetary phenomena, including magnetic field, plasma, and cosmic ray measurements for two or more passages of solar activity. As secondary mission Pioneer VIII would: (1) investigate continuously characteristics of the magnetosheath, investigate the geomagnetospheric tail, and acquire data when a highly significant solar event occurred; (2) refine primary determinations of earth and moon masses, the astronomical unit, and osculating elements of earth’s orbit; (3) provide synoptic study of solar-interplanetary relations; and (4) provide target for checkout and training of msfn equipment and operations personnel by launching a Test and Training Satellite (tts) as secondary payload. The 40-lb Tts I, carried pickaback on 2nd stage, was successfully ejected after 3rd-stage burnout, and entered orbit with 303-mi (488-km) apogee, 187-mi (301-km) perigee, 92-min period, and 33° inclination.

•	Dr. John S. Foster, Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering,
discussed importance of defense R&D and problem of choosing among new technological developments available. Speaking before the Dallas Chapter of the Assn, of the U.S. Army and the Dallas Council on World Affairs, he noted that over 80% of all the scientists and engineers who had ever lived were alive today; scientific and technical manpower had increased 400%, compared to 50% for labor force; and % of aU U.S. R&D supported national defense. Current defense R&D funding was $8 billion.
Discussing selection of proposed projects, he described a new tool and procedure called the Development Concept Paper, “a short, single document . . . [which] requires that . . . parties agree to a common document that states the issues, the assumptions, the alternative courses of action available, the pros and cons for each.” With this type of presentation, he said, the Secretary of Defense could more easily and more objectively decide whether to approve or reject a project, and if approved, the paper could be transmitted to project’s implementers as a guide. This new tool, he indicated, would be used in future to avoid repetition of past inappropriate decisions in which precious resources were wasted, such as air-launched Skybolt missile and B-70 aircraft which proved too vulnerable after $2 billion had been spent on their development; and C5-A subsonic transport aircraft, currently being produced for operation in 1969, whose production had been delayed since late 1950’s pending development of a system to utilize it. From such cases, Dr. Foster noted, “we have repeatedly learned that money is not enough. That enthusiasm is not enough. That technical innovation is not enough. We need critical analysis of purposes, missions, threats, and requirements. We also need realistic tested advanced alternatives produced by our investment in research. And to gain wise management decisions, we must join these together in constructive confrontation.” (Text)

•	Surveyor VI briefing was held at NASA Hq.
Dr. Leonard D. Jaffe, JPL Surveyor Project Scientist, said Surveyor VI had discovered or confirmed that: (1) lunar maria were covered primarily with very fine, 0.001-in-dia particles but also with “some coarse particles and rocks up to a yard across”; (2) particles stuck together weakly and were not suspended above lunar surface; (3) radar return was from surface and not from subsurface layer; (4) strength of lunar maria was three to eight pounds psi at one- to two-inch depth; (5) composition of rock was basic and basaltic with very little meteoritic iron on the surface; (6) surface was extremely uniform; and (7) particles were cohesive and adhesive, but there was “no need for concern” about manned spacecraft’s sinking or being covered by sticky soil in maria sites investigated.
Simultaneous operation of Surveyors V. and VI would permit measurement of moon’s “wobble” or physical libration by obtaining spacecraft’s range and range rate, Dr. John A. O’Keefe, Assistant Chief of gsfc’s Laboratory for Theoretical Studies, explained. “The moon has a sort of a nose [Sinus Medii, landing site of Surveyor L7] that sticks out in front. The earth’s gravity takes hold of that nose and wiggles it . . . back and forth as the earth slightly moves either way.” Although scientists had a fairly good idea of the size of the “nose” and how firmly earth could grab it, they did not know how the moon responded to the pull, he said. Response depended on whether lunar mass was concentrated toward the center, in which case it would yield easily, or toward the outside, in which case moon’s inertia would be much stronger. Dr. O’Keefe also showed Surveyor VI photos of lunar surface lit by sunshine. In one, corona was traceable out to a distance of 30 solar radii from the sun—furthest ever traced. Another revealed persistence of a line of light after the instant of true sunset. Line, which had appeared less clearly in previous Surveyor photos, he said, could be explained either as a layer of 0.001-inthick particles or as lunar material floating a short distance frcm surface because of electrostatic charges.
Surveyor VI mission represented “the completion of two major milestones of lunar surface exploration—the investigation and certification of four prime candidates for future manned landings and the scientific evaluation of four . .. widely separated regions in the moon’s equatorial belts,” Surveyor Program Manager Benjamin Milwitzky asserted. To maximize the scientific value of the last Surveyor mission in the series, NASA had established a group of scientists to study and recommend possible landing sites for Surveyor G. As a result of group’s recommendations, NASA had selected Tycho crater, south of the equator, as primary target, and Fra Mauro, north of the equator, as an alternate. Highland Tycho area was “risky as a landing site,” he said, because it was covered by ridges, grooves, and rocks, but it would provide scientific data for comparison with data from previous lowland maria landing sites. Sur-
veyor G, scheduled for launch Jan. 7, 1968, would be equipped with surface sampler, TV cameras, alpha-scattering instrument, and minor payload items such as magnets on footpads and surface sampler scoop and special mirrors. (Transcript; Reistrup, W Post, 12/15/67, A20; W Star, 12/15/67, A7)	_

•	Walter Sullivan, writing in the New York Times, listed proposed projects
to use atomic explosions for commercial applications being considered by aec. Project Sloop, a 20-kiloton, $13,175,000 explosion at 1,200-ft depth, would shatter a large body of copper ore in southeastern Arizona. Highly diluted acid would then be pumped into the broken rock to convert the copper into a soluble compound which could be pumped out. Project Bronco would shatter a northeastern Colorado shale oil deposit beyond reach of conventional extraction methods. Heat from the blast would liquefy the oil so that it would flow into the central cavity for extraction. Projects Dragon Trail and Ruleson would use nuclear explosion to carve a huge gas storage area beneath a Renovo, Pa., site. Other proposals included use of explosions to breax through impermeable rock formations in Arizona so that rain water could sink in and be stored underground and to dig canals, harbors, and mountain passes. According to aec price list, charge for 10-kiloton explosion would be $350,000 and for a two-megaton explosion, $600,000, excluding charges for safety studies, site preparation, transportation and emplacement of the devices, and support services.

•	Rep. William F. Ryan (D-N.Y.) charged that the House Committee on
Science and Astronautics and the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences had defaulted on their responsibility to report to the American public about the Congressional hearings which had been held on the Jan. 27 Apollo accident. In a statement inserted in the Congressional Record, Rep. Ryan said that since Congress seemed reluctant “to face some unpleasant truths and to ask some hard ques-. tions that need to be asked,” he had prepared his own report based on the hearings and on the hundreds of letters, documents, and personal commentaries he had received. Much of this correspondence, he said, which cited deficiencies and negligence which were both intentionally ignored and unintentionally overlooked, was made in confidence for fear of reprisals by NASA or NASA-contractor employers.
Rep. Ryan concluded that Congress overfunded and underexamined the validity of major technological programs and the success and integrity of their administration. Having an excellent space program, he said, “is essential both to our pride and to our progress . . . [but] it is essential as well that we throw off the shackles of the space race and declare our intention to make rational plans designed to meet the needs of America not distorted by the conceptions and value judgments of another nation. It is essential that we examine our national priorities with the utmost care and make certain that the space program is neither made a handy villain by its critics nor a handy saviour by its spokesmen. We must establish reliability and make a sober and objective appraisal of the space program’s role in our society.” Congress, he asserted, ought to: (1) demand that NASA adopt new standards of candor, present regular status reports, and clarify its budget presentations, and that a panel of independent experts be created to provide objective technical evaluation of NASA management and planning procedures; (2) relinquish romanticism and evaluate each program in terms of specific objectives and social value; (3) revise its attitudes about hearings on the space program, being sure to call both friendly and hostile witnesses; and (4) establish a realistic view so that the space program could be assigned its proper place in national priorities and receive whatever funds necessary.

Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space Dec. 16: “[Treaty] . . . is a substantial advance, but what must remain worrisome is the attitude toward such mishaps that will be shown [by] countries refusing to approve the pact. The largest of the abstainers, of course, is likely to be China.
“Even without this gap, the treaty has limitations. The suspicious will note that . . . the launching nation has no right to join in the search until and unless requested to do so by the authorities governing the area where the ship has landed. Nor does the treaty define with precision how long the latter authorities may hold a space vehicle and its crew before returning them . . .

•	Robert Walker, writing in the New York Times, reviewed new applications
for industrial use of gold. In telephone industry, gold was used for coating electromechanical switchgear and for transmitter domes; in computers, for coating metal tapes and electroplating printed circuits; and in automotive industry, for connecting alternator-regulator systems. To aerospace industry, one of gold’s most important characteristics was
that it reflected heat and light. Gold was used to coat the “umbilical cord” which connected Astronaut Edward H. White II to Gemini IV spacecraft (June 3, 1965); to cover shrouds that contracted very hot jet aircraft engine parts; and to coat satellites so that they reflected more than 90% of sun’s heat. By adding oxides to gold coatings space scientists used the gold to absorb infrared energy which could be converted to electrical energy. (Walker, Ayr, 12/24/67, IF)

•	In response to fcc inquiry on future communications in Atlantic area—
currently served by two comsats and four cables—ComSatCorp President Joseph V. Charyk and at&t Vice President Richard R. Hough presented their proposals in separate letters to fcc Chairman Rosel H. Hyde. Hough, advocating a fifth underwater cable, said that although AT&T supported the idea of a global comsat system, all of the international carriers believed the cable project was “the right way to add to our capabilities at this time.” The best service, he said, could be provided by “a balanced, integrated network of both cables and satellites.”
Charyk charged that the cable would not be economically feasible: “. . . when a new cable is laid to carry traffic that could otherwise be carried at no extra cost by satellite facilities which must be established in any case, the ultimate customer must bear the cable cost as an addition to the already committed costs of service.” As traffic was diverted from comsats to a cable, a greater share of satellite revenue requirement would have to be carried by routes not served by the
cable, primarily less developed countries with smaller traffic streams. U.S., he said, was committed to develop the Intelsat system. To ensure that U.S. met this commitment, “the advanced [comsat] system must be in operation in the time frame we have proposed for INTELSAT iv. It is essential that a vigorous advanced satellite development progam be under way during 1968.” (Texts; Smith, NYT, 12/29/67, 43) December 27: U.S.S.R. launched Cosmos CXCVIII into orbit with 281-km (175-mi) apogee, 265-km (165-mi) perigee, 89.8-min period, and 65.1° inclination.

Study, supported by nsf, would be conducted in cooperation with Ohio State Univ. and Belgian Atomic Center. Since the Antarctic snow was not contaminated by urban air pollution and never melted, extraterrestrial dust remained lodged as it fell in' layers of snow. Plateau Station area, Dr. Picciotto said, was “the only place on earth you can retrieve atmospheric precipitation from before the industrial revolution and the atomic bombs.” Ideally, the dust should have been collected in space, but space collection was too expensive and would be contaminated by spacecraft. Dr. Picciotto would extrapolate annual worldwide total from fallout rate at Plateau Station. Preliminary results suggested a 100,000-ton annual worldwide rate. (Reinhold, NYT, 1/9/68,4)
December 30: Among 12 scientists named by President Johnson to receive the 1967 National Medal of Science were Edwin H. Land, President of the Polaroid Corp.; Igor I. Sikorsky, former engineering manager of United Aircraft Corp.’s Sikorsky Aircraft Div.; and George B. Kistia-kowsky, Harvard Univ. chemistry professor. Presentations would be made in early 1968. {PD, 1/6/68, il)
December 31: aec Chairman Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg reviewed highlights of aec’s 1967 activity. “Outstanding . . . was the trend by electric utilities to go nuclear. During the year, utilities announced plans for at least 32 nuclear power plants and ordered 30 reactors . . . [representing] a capacity of more than 24 million kilowatts. . . . The nation enters the New Year with 15 operable nuclear power plants and 21 under construction. The trend points to a generating capacity by nuclear plants of between 120,000 and 170,000 net electrical megawatts by the end of 1980, or 25 percent of the total national capacity.” Other activities included: continued r&d with dod for strong nuclear defense capability; testing of first model of a cardiac pacemaker; limited distribution of a purified multiple vaccine which provided immunity to several different flu viruses with one inoculation; continued development of food irradiation program; sixth successful test of nerva; and successful Project Gashuggy nuclear explosion. In addition, AEC conducted research which provided numerous spin-off benefits to industry
and sponsored lectures, demonstrations, and exhibits, (aec Release K— 286; AP, W Post, 12/31/67, D14)
During December: A preliminary report on Surveyor V, compiled by OSSA, recounted spacecraft’s performance. “Surveyor V will be remembered as having first performed one of man’s most extraordinary technical feats, a remotely conducted analysis of the chemical constituents on an extraterrestrial body in our solar system.” The compilation included information on principal scientific results, TV observations, astronomy, lunar surface parameters, and lunar theory and processes.

•	JPL scientist Sidney J. Slomich, writing in Astronautics and Aeronautics,
emphasized need for national purpose to apply the highly advanced technology of space. “New impetus would be gained through the establishment of a coordinating national organization, governmental or private, to take advantage of the potential of advanced technology through modern communication techniques. The situation calls for a comprehensive national effort, with leadership coming from the highest levels of government to break down further interdisciplinary, interagency, organizational, and psychological and occupational barriers and to check out in detail a wide variety of potential applications like those cited above, relating them to the country’s and the world’s most pressing problems. . . . Emphasis should he on the application of the vast array of existing techniques, not on the development of new ones, and on nearterm objectives—no longer, say, than two or three years. Government agencies, the universities, publicly and privately supported research centers . . . must be banded together into a cooperative effort devoted to applying to the problems of our age the many solutions the new high technology makes possible. There is needed ... a public or private national organization, a research center, and, above all, a national purpose to bring this about.” (Slomich, A&A, 12/67, 54-8)
•	Claude Witze, in Air Force and Space Digest, claimed that usaf pilots
testing F—111 A were enthusiastic about the aircraft’s potential. “These . . . pilots consider the F-111A weapon system the greatest single technological jump designed for their mission since the wedding of the jet engine and modern avionics. The F-111A, they predict, will let them hit tactical targets harder, with greater accuracy, and at longer ranges than any other airplane. . . .” Accelerated F-lllA testing and training program begun at Nellis afb, Nev., in July had accumulated encouraging statistics, he said: “By September, the new wing had set an unprecedented record. During that month, the five planes flew a total of 304.1 hours, an average utilization rate of 60.8 hours per aircraft. In October, the month in which the first production model was delivered ... it was 59.7 hours per aircraft. The stated requirement for the F— 111 A is thirty hours per aircraft. The best previous records set at Nellis on other aircraft have been in the area of thirty-eight hours a month per aircraft... with systems far less complex than those of the F-lllA.” In addition, he noted, F-lllA had set “an extraordinary record for safety. Far fewer aircraft have been lost than usaf experienced in previous similar programs.” (AF/SD, 12/67,45-55; CR, 12/5/67, S1788-90)
•	Writing in Astronautics and Aeronautics, Hudson Institute scientists Her-
man Kahn and Anthony J. Wiener listed possible events and discoveries that could occur by the year 2000. List, according to the authors, showed “that as a result of the long-term trends toward accumulation of scientific
and technological knowledge and the institutionalization of change through research, development, innovation, and diffusion, many important new things are likely to happen in the next few decades.” List included: extension of life expectancy to more than 150 yrs; antigravity, practical use of gravity waves; interstellar travel; substantial lunar or planetary bases or colonies; and discovery of extraterrestrial life and, possibly, communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. (Kahn, Wiener, A&A, 12/67,28-48)
•	Calculation of effective radiated power by measurement of signal strength
from eleven orbiting military communications satellites was accomplished by AFCRL; two satellites exhibited below standard response. Measurements, made at 401 megacycles, were carried out at the 84-ft parabolic antenna facility, Sagamore Hill Radio Observatory, Mass. {OAR Res Rev, 12/67,4)
•	Development of a laser system for detecting small variations in moon’s
motion, and for measuring earth-moon distances to within two meters was reported by afcrl. A laser beam would be directed at a reflector placed on lunar surface; reflected light would be detected. (OAR Res Rev, 12/67, 5)
During 1967: In 1967, U.S. orbited 87 spacecraft; U.S.S.R., 67; France, 2; Italy, 1; Australia, 1; and U.S.-U.K., 1. U.S. total included 30 launches with 61 payloads for dod and 20 successful nasa missions in 22 attempts—highest percentage of successes in one year to date. NASA had one satellite as a secondary payload.
Highlighting NASA space achievements were closeup photographs of the moon provided by Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft; soft-landing on the moon by Surveyor III, V, and VI; successful Venus flyby by Mariner V; and preparation of a uv chart of sun’s surface temperature from Oso IV photos of the sun. Surveyor III, V, and VI radioed more than 50,000 closeup photos of the moon and conducted on-site chemical analyses of the lunar soil, confirming its being similar to basaltic rock on earth. First launch from lunar surface was accomplished when Surveyor Vi’s retrorockets were fired, lifting spacecraft and translating it to another site eight feet away. NASA launched Lunar Orbiter III, IV, and V, successfully completing the five-mission program and obtaining detailed photos of entire lunar surface—with 100 times the detail possible with earth-based telescopes—including eight prospective Apollo manned landing sites. Mariner V passed within 2,600 mi of Venus and radioed data on Venusian atmosphere and effects of solar wind.
Ground tests in Project Apollo were continued in preparation for three-man Apollo/Satum space flight planned for 1969. Following flash fire in which three astronauts died Jan. 27 during ground test at ksc, intensive studies were Conducted to devise new safety measures. Nearly all combustible materials were removed from the spacecraft, and the hatch was redesigned for fast escape. Apollo program climaxed Nov. 9 with successful maiden flight of Saturn V which orbited unmanned Apollo 4 spacecraft.
Applications satellites launched included three Intelsat comsats for ComSatCorp and three essa meteorological satellites for essa. Ats II provided first continuous high-quality photos of earth from geostationary orbit, and Biosatellite II provided new knowledge on effects of radiation and weightlessness on life forms. Scientific achievements included orbit-
ing of Oso III and IV, Ogo IV, Explorer XXXIV and XXXV satellites, and Pioneer VIII interplanetary spacecraft.
Some 180 meteorological sounding rockets and 105 scientific sounding rockets were launched, and RAM C—1 spacecraft was launched on suborhital mission to measure effectiveness of water-injection concept in maintaining communications during reentry.
Some 12 flights of X—15 rocket research aircraft were conducted, including record-setting 4,534 mph (mach 6.72) flight by Maj. William J. Knight (usaf). Following crash Nov. 15 in which first fatality in 191 X-15 tests occurred, flights were suspended pending a review of the accident. NASA—USAF flight research continued with 14 flights of XB-70 supersonic aircraft. President Johnson authorized faa to proceed with SST prototype construction, contracts were signed with Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., and construction was begun. Research programs were initiated for wing-structure designs for hypersonic aircraft which could make sustained flights at 5,300 mph (mach 8), and studies were undertaken to reduce aircraft noise. M2-F2 lifting-body vehicle crashed May 10, during its second flight of the year.
dod program included orbiting of two Vela nuclear-detection satellites and 11 idcsp comsats; static test-firing of Titan HIM 1st stage; and beginning of construction of MOL launch complex at Yandenberg AFB.
Among the highlights in propulsion technology was the third and final test firing of the 260-in-dia solid-propellant rocket motor, producing 5.8 million lbs of thrust. One test of NERVA nuclear reactor was conducted in which NRX—A6 was operated at full design power for 60 .min, achieving major goal of one-hour-duration operation. Phoebus IB was operated at 1,500 mw for 30 min, and Phoebus 2C-F underwent series of systems tests with conventional fuel.
Tracking, communications, and data acquisition reached greatest volume in 1967 with a large number of unmanned satellites and space probes, msfn stations conducted tracking operations with Lunar Orbiter spacecraft as targets after completion of missions’ photo-acquisition phases, and new Apollo Manned Space Flight Network was completely checked out using Tts I, launched as secondary payload with Pioneer VIII. At end of 1967, NASA’s Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition was simultaneously supporting 50 flight programs for NASA; six in cooperative international programs; and 12 for dod.
U.S.S.R. launched 67 payloads, including 61 Cosmos satellites, one Venus probe, one Soyuz spacecraft, and three Molniya I comsats. Venus IV landed on the Venusian surface and transmitted atmospheric data; Soyuz I, after 25-hr manned flight, crashed on landing, killing the pilot; and Cosmos CLXXXVI and Cosmos CLXXXVIII unmanned spacecraft achieved world’s first automatic docking in space.

• International space events were highlighted by ratification on Oct. 10, 1967, of space law treaty, approved by U.N. on Dec. 19,1966, and endorsement on Dec. 19, 1967, of a new treaty providing for rescue of astronauts. Draft of space rescue treaty, negotiated by the Legal Subcommittee of the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, would become effective following ratification by five nations, including U.S., U.S.S.R., and U.K.
NASA’s international program included orbiting of U.K.’s Ariel III and
ESRo’s Esro II and assistance with orbiting of Italy’s San Marco II—first satellite to be launched from a platform at sea. Some 124 scientists from 26 countries participated in research at NASA centers; scientific sounding rockets were launched from six sites in cooperation with Argentina, Brazil, West Germany, India, Japan, and Norway; and by the end of 1967, 84 countries had cooperated with U.S. in space research activities.
Kenya, Korea, Peru, and Tanzania joined the International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (intelsat), bringing total membership to 60.
Australia successfully launched her first satellite, Wresat 1. (nasa Re' lease 67—301; EH; ComSatCorp pio; NASA International Programs)
•	Rep. Joseph E. Karth (D-Minn.), Chairman, House Committee on Science
and Astronautics’ Space Science and Applications Subcommittee, in interview with Aerospace Management, said: “The Space Program got off the ground ten years ago on a surge of apprehension and sensationalism. This year it became very clear that public acceptance or rejection will be a key factor in shaping the U.S. objectives in space for the years ahead. Having ushered in the second decade of space exploration, both NASA and the aerospace industry should now review their ‘ledgers’ to make the best use of their achievements to date, as well as learn from the mistakes and false-starts of the past.” He predicted: “I have no doubts that before this century is over, man will set foot on the near planets [although] it seems more reasonable to me to first find out more about the other planets by means of automated robots [and] I will be disappointed if ... we don’t couple the great capabilities of the Saturn V vehicle with those of a Voyager spacecraft.” He added: “However, be they the merits of the Voyager concept or the potential benefits of Earth Resources Satellites, the public and Congress must be honestly convinced of their values if space efforts are to be supported.” (Karth, Aerospace Management, Fall/Winter 67, 5—9)
•	High probability of mission success for Saturn project was born of sound
engineering, judgment built on extensive experience, and supported by modern analytical techniques, Special Assistant in Manufacturing Problems to MSC Apollo Spacecraft Program Mgr. (former msfc Deputy Director) Dr. Eberhard F. M. Rees said in interview with Aerospace Management. He summarized the factors which had enhanced the probability: “Considering that one Saturn V, including the launching costs, amounts to over 150 million, it is not hard to see why the test launchings preceding manned flights must be limited to only a few. What this limitation has done then is to stress more than ever before the critical need for intensive engineering, almost a compulsive meticulousness in manufacturing assembly, quality control, and most extensive testing on the ground, such as component qualification testing, and subsystem and system testing.” (Rees, Aerospace Management, Fall/Winter 67, 23-27)	'
•	Managerial and technical challenges of the Mariner project were high-
lighted by JPL scientist Dan Schneiderman in interview with Aerospace Management: “We have tried to recognize and correct our deficiencies, to retain the proven practices in the screening and use of reliable hardware, also to retain the integrity of our experienced manpower resources.” He added: “The basic challenge in planetary exploration is that of designing and building autonomous systems that can operate unattended for long periods. This is a quality and reliability challenge,
augmented by cost and weight limitations, plus a launch-window constraint. In the face of these constraints, we can’t buy in large quantities, nor be extensively experimental. We have instead concentrated on implementing a tight quality assurance.” (Schneiderman, Aerospace Management, Fall/Winter 67,17-21)
• Highlights of AEC’s annual report to Congress for 1967: major systefn testing for NERVAI and its reactor was planned; post-operation examination revealed no life-limiting problems in ground test unit of snap-IOA after operation in simulated space environment for 417 days; Project Gas-buggy, first joint industry-government Plowshare experiment, investigated use of underground nuclear explosion to increase productivity in New Mexico natural gas field; two AEC-instrumented Vela satellites for nuclear test detection were launched, raising total now in orbit to eight; 25 underground nuclear tests were conducted.
